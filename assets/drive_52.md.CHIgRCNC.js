In Virgil's recounting of the blinding of the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus, from the Odyssey, in his Aeneid, he has Odysseus and his men first \\"ask for the assistance of the great numina\\" (magna precati numina).3\\\\. 634. Reviewing public opinion of Augustus on the day of his funeral, the historian Tacitus reports that some thought \\"no honor was left to the gods\\" when he \\"established the cult of himself\\" (se ... coli vellet) \\"with temples and the effigies of numina\\" (effigie numinum). Pliny the younger in a letter to Paternus raves about the \\"power,\\" the \\"dignity,\\" and \\"the majesty;\\" in short, the \\"numen of history.\\" Lucretius uses the expression numen mentis,T. Lucretius Carus, De Natura rerum, 3.144. or \\"bidding of the mind,\\" where \\"bidding\\" is numen, not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will. Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the history of religion as a pre-animistic phase; that is, a belief system inherited from an earlier time. Numen is also used by sociologists to refer to the idea of magical power residing in an object, particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, numen is nearly synonymous with mana. However, some authors reserve use of mana for ideas about magic from Polynesia and southeast Asia. Etymology Etymologically, the word means \\"a nod of the head\\", here referring to a deity as it were \\"nodding\\", or making its will or its presence known). According to H. J. Rose: > The literal meaning is simply \\"a nod\\", or more accurately, for it is a > passive formation, \\"that which is produced by nodding\\", just as flamen is > \\"that which is produced by blowing\\", i.e., a gust of wind. It came to mean > \\"the product or expression of power\\" — not, be it noted, power itself. Thus, numen (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from deus (god)., freely available from Project Gutenberg Roman cults of the numina Numen was also used in the imperial cult of ancient Rome, to refer to the guardian-spirit, 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor—in other words, a means of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god. The cult of Augustus was promoted by Tiberius, who dedicated the Ara Numinis Augusti. Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990). In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms numen and genius. Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990). Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion The expression Numen inest appears in Ovid's Fasti (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'.Ovid. Fasti. Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931. Its interpretation, and in particular the exact sense of numen has been discussed extensively in the literature. The supposition that a numinous presence in the natural world supposed in the earliest layers of Italic religion, as it were an \\"animistic\\" element left over in historical Roman religion and especially in the etymology of Latin theonyms, has often been popularly implied, but was criticised as \\"mostly a scholarly fiction\\" by McGeough (2004).Kevin McGeough The Romans: new perspectives 2004:179 \\"Numinous Forces and Other scholarly Inventions\\"; \\"Scholars may have to content themselves with nodes of meanings for the Italic gods rather than hard-and- fast definitions,\\" observes Charles Robert Phillips III, in \\"A Note on Vergil's Aeneid 5, 744,\\" Hermes 104.2 (1976:247–249) p. 248, with recent bibliography; Gerhard Radke's classification of the forms and significances of these multifarious names in Die Götter Altitaliens (Münster, 1965) was criticized as \\"unwarranted precision\\" in the review by A. Drummond in The Classical Review, New Series, 21.2 (June 1971:239–241); the coupling and uncoupling of Latin and Italic cognomina of the gods, creating the appearance of a multitude of deities, were classically dissected in Jesse Benedictus Carter, De Deorum Romanorum Cognominibus: Quaestiones Selectae (Leipzig, 1898).

Symptoms of CCHF may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Onset of symptoms is less than two weeks following exposure. Complications may include liver failure. In those who survive, recovery generally occurs around two weeks after onset. The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease. Groups that are at high risk of infection are farmers and those who work in slaughterhouses. The virus can also spread between people via body fluids. Diagnosis is by detecting antibodies, the virus's RNA, or the virus itself. It is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever. Prevention involves avoiding tick bites. A vaccine is not commercially available. Treatment is typically with supportive care. The medication ribavirin may also help. It occurs in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. Often it occurs in outbreaks. In 2013 Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan documented more than fifty cases. The risk of death among those affected is between 10 and 40%. It was first detected in the 1940s. Signs and symptoms The illness in humans is a severe form of hemorrhagic fever. Typically, after a 1–3 day incubation period following a tick bite or 5–6 days after exposure to infected blood or tissues, flu-like symptoms appear, which may resolve after one week. In up to 75% of cases, signs of bleeding can appear within 3–5 days of the onset of illness in case of bad containment of the first symptoms: mood instability, agitation, mental confusion and throat petechiae; and soon after nosebleeds, vomiting, and black stools. The liver becomes swollen and painful. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur, as well as acute kidney failure, shock, and sometimes acute respiratory distress syndrome. People usually begin to recover 9–10 days after first symptoms appear. Up to 30% of infected people die by the end of the second week of illness. Cause =Virology= The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus, family Nairoviridae of RNA viruses.Virus Taxonomy: 2018 Release, EC 50, Washington, DC, July 2018, Email ratification October 2018 (MSL #33) https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/ The virions are 80–120 nanometers (nm) in diameter and are pleomorphic. There are no host ribosomes within the virion. Each virion contains three copies of the genome. The envelope is single layered and is formed from a lipid bilayer 5 nm thick. It has no protrusions. The envelope proteins form small projections ~5–10 nm long. The nucleocapsids are filamentous and circular with a length of 200–3000 nm. The virus might enter a cell using the cell surface protein nucleolin. Molecular biology The genome is circular, negative sense RNA in three parts – Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L). The L segment is 11–14.4 kilobases in length while the M and S segments are 4.4–6.3 and 1.7–2.1 kilobases long respectively. The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes the envelope glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein. The mutation rates for the three parts of the genome were estimated to be: 1.09, 1.52 and 0.58 substitutions/site/year for the S, M, and L segments respectively. Population genetics CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses: Its nucleotide sequences frequently differ between different strains, ranging from a 20% variability for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with diverse sequences can be found within the same geographic area; closely related viruses have been isolated from widely separated regions, suggesting that viral dispersion has occurred possibly by ticks carried on migratory birds or through international livestock trade. Reassortment among genome segments during coinfection of ticks or vertebrates seems likely to have played a role in generating diversity in this virus. Based on the sequence data, seven genotypes of CCHFV have been recognised: Africa 1 (Senegal), Africa 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa), Africa 3 (southern and western Africa), Europe 1 (Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Russia and Turkey), Europe 2 (Greece), Asia 1 (the Middle East, Iran and Pakistan) and Asia 2 (China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). =Transmission= Hyalomma tick Ticks are both \\"environmental reservoir\\" and vector for the virus, carrying it from wild animals to domestic animals and humans. Tick species identified as infected with the virus include Argas reflexus, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma marginatum marginatum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. At least 31 different species of ticks from the genera Haemaphysalis and Hyalomma in southeastern Iran have been found to carry the virus. Wild animals and small mammals, particularly European hare, Middle-African hedgehogs and multimammate rats are the \\"amplifying hosts\\" of the virus. Birds are generally resistant to CCHF, with the exception of ostriches. Domestic animals like sheep, goats and cattle can develop high titers of virus in their blood, but tend not to fall ill. The \\"sporadic infection\\" of humans is usually caused by a Hyalomma tick bite. Animals can transmit the virus to humans, but this would usually be as part of a disease cluster. When clusters of illness occur, it is typically after people treat, butcher or eat infected livestock, particularly ruminants and ostriches. Outbreaks have occurred in abattoirs and other places where workers have been exposed to infected human or animal blood and fomites Humans can infect humans and outbreaks also occur in clinical facilities through infected blood and unclean medical instruments. Prevention Where mammalian tick infection is common, agricultural regulations require de-ticking farm animals before transportation or delivery for slaughter. Personal tick avoidance measures are recommended, such as use of insect repellents, adequate clothing, and body inspection for adherent ticks. When feverish patients with evidence of bleeding require resuscitation or intensive care, body substance isolation precautions should be taken. =Vaccine= Since the 1970s, several vaccine trials around the world against CCHF have been terminated due to high toxicity. , the only available and probably somewhat efficacious CCHF vaccine has been an inactivated antigen preparation then used in Bulgaria. No publication in the scientific literature related to this vaccine exists, which a Turkish virologist called suspicious both because antiquated technology and mouse brain were used to manufacture it. More vaccines are under development, but the sporadic nature of the disease, even in endemic countries, suggests that large trials of vaccine efficacy will be difficult to perform. Finding volunteers may prove challenging, given growing anti-vaccination sentiment and resistance of populations to vaccination against contagious diseases. The number of people to be vaccinated, and the length of time they would have to be followed to confirm protection would have to be carefully defined. Alternatively, many scientists appear to believe that treatment of CCHF with ribavirin is more practical than prevention, but some recently conducted clinical trials appear to counter assumptions of drug efficacy. In 2011, a Turkish research team led by Erciyes University successfully developed the first non-toxic preventive vaccine, which passed clinical trials. As of 2012, the vaccine was pending approval by the US FDA. Since the Ebola epidemic, the WHO jumpstarted a \\"Blueprint for Research and Development preparedness\\" on emerging pathogens with epidemic potential, against which there are no medical treatments. CCHF was the top priority on the initial list from December 2015, and is second as of January 2017. Treatment Treatment is mostly supportive. Ribavirin is effective in vitro and has been used by mouth during outbreaks, but there is uncertain evidence to support its use. the use of Immunoglobulin preparations has remained unproven and antibody engineering, which raised hopes for monoclonal antibody therapy, has remained in its infancy. The United States armed forces maintain special stocks of ribavirin to protect personnel deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq from CCHF. Epidemiology CCHD occurs most frequently among agricultural workers, following the bite of an infected tick, and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers exposed to the blood and tissues of infected livestock, and medical personnel through contact with the body fluids of infected persons. =Geographic distribution= the northern limit of CCHF has been 50 degrees northern latitude, north of which the Hyalomma ticks have not been found. Per a WHO map from 2008, Hyalomma ticks occurred south of this latitude across all of the Eurasian continent and Africa, sparing only the islands of Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Japan. Serological or virological evidence of CCHF was widespread in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East (except Israel, Lebanon and Jordan), central Africa, Western Africa, South Africa and Madagascar. In 2008, more than 50 cases/year were reported from only 4 countries: Turkey, Iran, Russia and Uzbekistan. 5-49 cases/year were present in South Africa, Central Asia including Pakistan and Afghanistan (but sparing Turkmenistan), in the Middle East only the UAE and the Balkan countries limited to Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo-Albania. A 2014 map by the CDC shows endemic areas (in red) largely unchanged in Africa and the Middle East, but different for the Balkan, including all countries of the former Yugoslavia, and also Greece, but no longer Romania. India's Northwestern regions of Rajastan and Gujarat saw their first cases. =Outbreaks= From 1995 to 2013, 228 cases of CCHF were reported in the Republic of Kosovo, with a case-fatality rate of 25.5%. Between 2002–2008 the Ministry of Health of Turkey reported 3,128 CCHF cases, with a 5% death rate. In July 2005, authorities reported 41 cases of CCHF in central Turkey's Yozgat Province, with one death. As of August 2008, a total of 50 deaths were reported for the year thus far in various cities in Turkey due to CCHF. In September 2010, an outbreak was reported in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Poor diagnosis and record keeping caused the extent of the outbreak to be uncertain, though some reports indicated over 100 cases, with a case- fatality rate above 10%. In January 2011, the first human cases of CCHF in India was reported in Sanand, Gujarat, India, with 4 reported deaths, which included the index patient, treating physician and nurse.Syed Khalique Ahmed, Tanvir A Siddiqui, Anuradha Mascarenhas, Anuradha Mascarenhas, Tanvir A Siddiqui, Syed Khalique Ahmed : Pune, Ahmedabad Deadly virus-makes first appearance in india kills three in gujarat indianexpress.com, 19 January 2011 , 71 people were reported to have contracted the disease in Iran, resulting in 8 fatalities. In October 2012, a British man died from the disease at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He had earlier been admitted to Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow, after returning on a flight from Kabul in Afghanistan. In July 2013, seven persons died due to CCHF in Kariyana village in Babra taluka, Amreli district, Gujarat, India. In August 2013, a farmer from Agago, Uganda was treated at Kalongo Hospital for a confirmed CCHF infection. The deaths of three other individuals in the northern region were suspected to have been caused by the virus. Another unrelated CCHF patient was admitted to Mulago Hospital on the same day. The Ministry of Health announced on the 19th that the outbreak was under control, but the second patient, a 27-year-old woman from Nansana, died on the 21st. She is believed to have contracted the virus from her husband, who returned to Kampala after being treated for CCHF in Juba, South Sudan. In June 2014, cases were diagnosed in Kazakhstan. Ten people, including an ambulance crew, were admitted on to hospital in southern Kazakhstan with suspected CCHF. In July 2014 an 8th person was found to be infected with CCHF at Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Pakistan. The eight patients, including a nurse and 6 Afghan nationals, died between April and July 2014. , sporadic confirmed cases have been reported from Bhuj, Amreli, Sanand, Idar and Vadnagar in Gujarat, India. In November 2014, a doctor and a labourer in north Gujarat tested positive for the disease. In the following weeks, three more people died from CCHF. In March 2015, one more person died of CCHF in Gujarat. As of 2015, among livestock, CCHF was recognized as \\"widespread\\" in India, only 4 years after the first human case had been diagnosed. In August 2016, the first local case of CCHF in Western Europe occurred in Western Spain. A 62-year-old man, who had been bitten by a tick in Spain died on August 25, having infected a nurse. The tick bite occurred in the province of Ávila, 300 km away from the province of Cáceres, where CCHF viral RNA from ticks was amplified in 2010. it was unclear what specific ecology led to the Spanish cases. In August 2016, a number of Pakistani news sources raised concerns regarding the disease. Between January and October 2016, CCHF outbreaks in Pakistan were reported with highest numbers of cases and deaths during August 2016, just before the festival of Eid-al-Adha (held on September 13–15 in 2016). It was hypothesized that the festival could play an important part as people could come into contact with domestic or imported animals potentially infected with CCHF virus. The Pakistani NIH showed there was no correlation, and that CCHF cases have coincided with the peak tick proliferation during the preceding 8–10 years. On February 5, 2020, an outbreak occurred in the central region of Mali. The infected are from Douentza and Mopti region. So far 7 people have died. History The virus may have evolved around 1500–1100 BC. It is thought that changing climate and agricultural practices around this time could be behind its evolution. In the 12th century a case of a hemorrhagic disease reported from what is now Tajikistan may have been the first known case of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever. During the Crimean War, the disease was known as \\"Crimean fever\\" and contracted by many, including Florence Nightingale.Cromwell, Judith Lissauer, Florence Nightingale, Feminist, McFarland, 2013, p.149 In 1944, Soviet scientists first identified the disease they called Crimean hemorrhagic fever in Crimea. They established its viral etiology, but were unable to isolate the agent at that time. In February 1967, virologists Jack Woodall, David Simpson, Ghislaine Courtois and others published initial reports on a virus they called the Congo virus. In 1956, the Congo virus had first been isolated by physician Ghislaine Courtois, head of the Provincial Medical Laboratory, Stanleyville, in the Belgian Congo. Strain V3010, isolated by Courtois, was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory (RFVL) in New York City and found to be identical to another strain from Uganda, but to no other named virus at that time. In June 1967, Soviet virologist Mikhail Chumakov registered an isolate from a fatal case that occurred in Samarkand in the Catalogue of Arthropod-borne Viruses. In 1969, the Russian strain, which Chumakov had sent to the RFVL, was published to be identical to the Congo virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses proposed the name Congo–Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus, but the Soviets insisted on Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. In 1973, against all principles of scientific nomenclature based on priority of publication, it was adopted as the official name, in possibly the first instance of a virus losing its name to politics and the Cold War. Since then, Congo–Crimean or just Congo virus has been used in many reports, which would be missed in searches of medical databases using the official name. These reports include records of the occurrence of the virus or antibodies to the virus from Greece, Portugal, South Africa, Madagascar (the first isolation from there), the Maghreb, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.

Charles Frederick Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, 13th Duke of St Albans, OBE (16 August 1915 - 8 October 1988) was a British soldier and peer. OBE insignia Background St Albans was the son of Aubrey Topham Beauclerk by his marriage to Gwendolen Loftus Hughes. A great-grandson of William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans, by the mid 1920s it seemed possible that he would inherit the dukedom, as the wife of his second cousin Osborne Beauclerk, 12th Duke of St Albans, was past child-bearing age. Charles St Albans was educated at Hordle House School, Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge. Career Commissioned in the British Army, he reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Intelligence Corps before the age of 30, and later was deployed to the British Embassy in Vienna. He moved to London after the birth of his fourth son, and joined the Central Office of Information. He became head in turn of the Film, Radio and Book divisions. He inherited the dukedom from his cousin in 1964, after which he left the Central Office of Information. He attempted to rebuild the family fortunes through a series of misguided ventures, which led to massive personal losses for himself, and accusation of mishandling of share dealing in relation to the company Grendon Securities. As Hereditary Grand Falconer of England, the Duke had an ancient entitlement to an annual side of venison from deer culled in the Royal Parks,\\"Obituary: The Duke of St Albans.\\", The Times, London, 11 October 1988 which he gave to charity.

Optional ingredients such as flavors, chopped dried fruit and chopped nuts are frequently added. Replacing the sugar with brown sugar results in a related confection called \\"sea foam\\". History Believed to have originated in the U.S. during the early 1900s, the candy's current form can be traced to a recipe from 1915. Another earlier version, which included the use of milk, can be traced to around 1907. One proposed theory for its origins is that in the early 20th century, corn syrup (a major ingredient) was starting to be used as a popular sugar substitute. New recipes for its use were being frequently created by the major manufacturers, one of which may have been divinity. The origins of the name are not clear. The most popular theory is simply that when first tasted, someone declared it to be, \\"Divine!\\" and the name stuck. Divinity has at times been referred to as a \\"Southern candy\\", most likely because of the frequent use of pecans in the recipe. It eventually made its way north, and today its recipe can be found in many cookbooks. Weather and altitude Humidity during preparation can affect the quality of divinity. For a batch to be successful, the humidity must be low enough for the candy to dry properly. Due to the high amounts of sugar, divinity acts like a sponge. If the environment is very humid (over 50%) the candy will absorb moisture from the air, remaining gooey. Under the right conditions, it is a soft, white candy which should be dry to the touch. Divinity, like many other confections and baked goods, needs to have its recipe altered for high-altitude areas (over 3500 feet). One method is to reduce the temperature of the sugar mixture by about ten degrees Fahrenheit. In popular culture *In the Peanuts comic strip in the 1960s, Linus Van Pelt was known to have an affinity for divinity, even being prepared to compliment his sister Lucy to receive a piece. *The B-52's' song \\"Give Me Back My Man\\" features the line \\"Throws Divinity on the sand\\", as the narrator's attempt to entice a hungry shark into sparing her sweetheart's life in exchange for the candy. This explanation is provided by Cindy Wilson in the book \\"The B-52's Universe\\" by Mats Sexton. The band, being from Athens, Georgia would be familiar with this Southern candy.

Previously, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2006–2008) and the National Security Adviser (2006) of the Republic of Korea. As a career diplomat for over thirty years, Song has participated in numerous negotiations, including the Korean Peace Talks in Geneva (1999), the revised Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) negotiations between the United States and Korea (1989–1991, 1999–2001), and the Six-Party Talks on the North Korean nuclear program as Chief Negotiator of South Korea, thus spearheading the landmark Joint Statement of September 19, 2005. Early life (1948-1975) Born in Jinyang (present-day Jinju) in 1948, Song studied at Masan High School and received his B.A. in German Literature from Seoul National University in 1975. He served in the Army for three years, completing his military service before graduation, and passed the Korean foreign service exam in 1975. Work in government (September 1975–February 2008) =Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (1975-2006)= Song Minsoon as chief South Korean negotiator at the Six-Party Talks in 2005 As a young diplomat, Song had his first foreign posting in Germany. Subsequently, he had the opportunity to work around the globe through assignments in India, the United States, Singapore, and Poland. Between 1989 and 1991, Song participated in the successful completion of the First Revised Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States and Korea. As Director-General of the North American Affairs Bureau, Song headed the Second U.S.-Korea Revised SOFA negotiations (1999–2000), successfully improving upon the previous agreement in seven fields, including environmental protection and criminal trial procedures. In December 2000, Song led the U.S.-Korea Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) negotiations, and in March 2001, he was appointed ROK's Ambassador to the Republic of Poland. As Deputy Minister for Political Affairs, Song was Chief Negotiator to the Six-Party Talks. His efforts helped produce what has now become the quintessential blueprint for achieving a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula: the Joint Statement of September 19, 2005. The following are the main achievements of the Statement: * The Six Parties unanimously reaffirmed that the goal of the Six- Party talks is the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. * The DPRK committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards. * The 1992 Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be observed and implemented. * The DPRK stated that it has the right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. * The other parties expressed their respect and agreed to discuss, at an appropriate time, the subject of the provision of light water reactor to the DPRK. * The DPRK and the United States undertook to respect each other's sovereignty, exist peacefully together, and take steps to normalize their relations subject to their respective bilateral policies. * China, Japan, ROK, Russia and the US stated their willingness to provide energy assistance to the DPRK. * The directly related parties will negotiate a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula at an appropriate separate forum. * The Six Parties agreed to take coordinated steps to implement the afore-mentioned consensus in a phased manner in line with the principle of \\"commitment for commitment, action for action\\". Through these top diplomatic assignments and achievements, Song made a lasting impact on the furtherance of Korean diplomacy and the international effort to denuclearize North Korea. =National Security Adviser (2006) = In January 2006, President Roh Moo- hyun appointed Song as his National Security Adviser. During his time as National Security Adviser, Song was accredited to have successfully handled two major foreign policy crises: North Korea's missile launching incident in July and its first nuclear test in October. Song Minsoon with former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2007 Song Minsoon with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in 2007 = 34th Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2006-2008)= In December 2006, Song was appointed the 34th Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea. He succeeded Ban Ki-moon and cooperated with world-wide leaders to drive forward the Six-Party Talks. Significantly, Song's leadership helped achieve the Initial Actions for Implementation of the Joint Statement, issued on Tuesday February 13, 2007. This was heralded as one of the most significant milestones in the international effort to denuclearize North Korea and bring peace to the Korean peninsular. The major points in the agreement were that: * North Korea will shut down and seal the Yongbyon nuclear facility, including the reprocessing facility and invite back IAEA personnel to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications. * In return, the other five parties in the six-party talks will provide emergency energy assistance to North Korea in the initial phase of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, to commence within 60 days. * All six parties agree to take positive steps to increase mutual trust, and make joint efforts for lasting peace and stability in Northeast Asia. Directly related parties will negotiate a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula at an appropriate separate forum. * All six parties agree on establishing five working groups - on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, normalization of North Korea-U.S. relations, normalization of North Korea- Japan relations, economy and energy cooperation, as well as a joint Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism. This Joint Statement led to the shutting- down of North Korea's plutonium producing plant at Yongbyon in July. In October, Pyongyang started to disable the Yongbyon plant by removing eight thousand fuel rods from the nuclear reactor.http://www.cfr.org/publication/13593/sixparty_talks_on_north_koreas_nuclear_program.html Another significant achievement while Song was in office was the conclusion of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in 2007. This is the largest FTA that Korea has signed with a single country, and the first U.S. FTA to be signed with a major Asian economy. The FTA now stands pending in the legislatures of both sides of the pacific.  Work in the National Assembly (June 2008-present) Song Minsoon introducing a draft act on Korean participation in United Nations Peace Keeping Operations to the National Assembly of South Korea in 2009 Elected to the 18th National Assembly in June 2008, Song now serves on the Foreign Affairs, Trade & Unification Committee. As a new member of the National Assembly, he has been promoting legal reforms that address important foreign policy challenges, such as improving Korea's Official Development Assistance (ODA) policies and streamlining procedures for a more rapid deployment of Korean UN PKO forces. Another major area of interest has been the settlement of North Korean defectors in South Korea who are currently not receiving adequate vocational training. As a corrective, Song has proposed that current laws mandating an eight-week training period be revised to provide for at least one year of diversified and specialized training programs. His major legislations so far have been: *Laws ** Framework Act on International Development Cooperation (2009) ** Act on Korean Participation in United Nations Peace Keeping Operations (2009) ** Amendment of the Act on the Protection and Assistance of North Korean Refugees in Korea (2009) ** Amendment of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund Act (2010) *Resolutions ** Resolution on Supporting Korea's Entry to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) and Urging the Reform of Korea's Official Development Assistance (ODA) system (Feb 2009) ** Resolution Calling on the Improvement of Human Rights in North Korea and the Promotion of Inter-Korean Cooperation(Oct 2010)http://www.mssong.or.kr/board/board.php?board=press1&command;=body&no;=36http://dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00600#=6878 In seeking to enhance Korea's global standing and accelerate inter-Korean reconciliation, Song continues to collaborate with colleagues within and without the National Assembly in a principled and bipartisan manner. He hopes that these efforts will ultimately pave the way for creating a reunified nation that is democratic, market-oriented, denuclearized, and friendly to all neighbors.

It is also known as and H&C.; It is published by Shueisha, initially serialized from June 2000 to July 2006 in the magazines CUTiEcomic, Young YOU, and Chorus, and collected in ten bound volumes. The series depicts the lives and relationships of a group of art school students who live in the same apartment building. In 2003, the manga won the 27th Kodansha Manga Award for shōjo. The series was adapted as an animated television series by J.C.Staff, initially broadcast on Fuji TV in two seasons from April to September 2005 and June to September 2006. The series was also adapted as a live action movie, which was released in theaters in Japan on July 22, 2006, and two separate live-action television dramas in 2008, one broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from January 8, 2008 to March 18, 2008 and the other broadcast in Taiwan on CTS beginning on May 25, 2008. Plot Yūta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live in the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo. One day, they are introduced to Hagumi Hanamoto, the daughter of a cousin of Shūji Hanamoto, an art professor, who has come to live with Hanamoto and has become a first year art student at the art school that everyone attends. Yuta and Shinobu both fall in love with Hagu, but Yuta hides his feelings and tries to be a friend to Hagu while Shinobu expresses his love in ways that seem only to scare Hagu, such as calling her \\"Mousey\\" and constantly photographing her. Hagu herself, though initially timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up to the three. The group comes to include Ayumi Yamada, a master of pottery who is well known by her nickname \\"Tetsujin\\" (Iron Lady), who becomes very close to Hagu. When not at school, she helps run the family liquor store. While Ayumi is popular with many young men, she falls in love with Takumi, who does not reciprocate her feelings and considers her a very dear friend. Instead, Takumi pursues an older woman, Rika Harada, a widowed friend of Professor Hanamoto who runs an architecture studio she founded with her late husband. The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about themselves. Main characters ; : Portrayed by: Hiroshi Kamiya (anime, Japanese), Kenji Nojima (final episode in TV production), Yuri Lowenthal (anime, English), Shō Sakurai (movie), Toma Ikuta (Japanese TV drama) : A second-year art student, age 19 at the start of the series, living in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita. Takemoto is the main character and acts as the point-of-view of the series, and often as narrator of episodes. He is depicted as the most mellow of the main characters. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor but keeps his feelings to himself through most of the series. Because of his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita, Takemoto decides to act as a brother-figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed, for example, building her sophisticated dollhouses at her request. Later in the series, as a result of his conflicted emotions, Takemoto develops a stomach ulcer, forcing him to repeat a year of school. Early in the series, he questions his vocation as an artist, but over the series he becomes comfortable with himself. After a bicycle trip to Cape Sōya, the northernmost point in Japan, Takemoto gains the confidence to tell Hagu how he really feels. Although Hagu does not accept him, Takemoto admits that just meeting her and the time they spend together has influenced him. ; : Portrayed by: Haruka Kudō (anime, Japanese), Heather Halley (anime, English), Yū Aoi (movie), Riko Narumi (Japanese TV drama) : Usually called \\"Hagu\\" by her friends, she is an 18-year-old first-year art student at the start of the series. She is depicted as appearing and acting several years younger than her true age. Despite her appearance, she is a gifted artist and her work is highly praised by art professionals. She is shy and very nervous when interacting with people, to the point of becoming physically ill from stress, with the result that other art students think she is strange. She was raised by her grandmother in a sheltered environment, where she learned to draw sketching the ever-changing view from her porch. When Morita and Takemoto first meet Hagu, they both immediately fall in love with her, although they express it in different ways. Hagu spends most of the series unaware of their feelings for her, seeing them as friends. After Takemoto confesses his feelings for her, she begins avoiding him, and at the end of the series she admits she loves Morita. However, she returns to Shūji because she cannot imagine a life without drawing. ; : Portrayed by: Yūji Ueda (anime, Japanese), Sam Riegel (anime, English), Yūsuke Iseya (movie), Hiroki Narimiya (Japanese TV drama) : A sixth-year art student, age 24 at the start of the series, in the same apartment complex as Takemoto and Mayama. Morita is depicted as a perpetual student, unable to graduate because of persistent absenteeism. This is mainly due to his work, which forces him to go missing for several days, after which he sleeps for at least 48 hours. Morita is considered mysterious by the other students, prone to bizarre behavior such as creating a version of Twister with too many colors. He is a perceptive person who cares for his friends Takemoto and Mayama but often expressing himself tactlessly, and who is not generous with his money and food. He also expresses his desire for Hagu in quirky ways, such as forcing her to dress up as a mouse because he likes cute things. Later in the series, he departs for a year in America, and eventually the others learn he has been moonlighting as an award-winning CGI artist. ; : Portrayed by: Tomokazu Sugita (anime, Japanese), Cam Clarke (anime, English), Ryō Kase (movie), Osamu Mukai (Japanese TV drama) : A fourth-year art student, age 22 at the start of the series, in the same apartment complex as Takemoto and Morita. He acts as a senpai (senior) to Takemoto and tries to help Morita get up for early morning classes. Early in the series, Mayama helps Rika Harada out with various errands at her design firm, Harada Design, during which time he develops feelings for Rika. The series initially leaves unclear whether Mayama takes advantage of Rika's disability to fulfill his desires, but it is later shown that Rika reciprocates his feelings. At her urging, Mayama begins working for a different design firm, but after it breaks up, near the end of the series, he returns to work for Rika. Despite Yamada's throwing herself at him, Mayama considers her only as his close friend, but he becomes protective of her when a colleague with a reputation for playing girls develops an interest in her. ; : Portrayed by: Mikako Takahashi (anime, Japanese), Julie Ann Taylor (anime, English), Megumi Seki (movie), Natsuki Harada (Japanese TV drama) : A third- year art student, age 21 at the start of the series, specializing in ceramic arts. She is well-known by other students for her pottery and her nickname Tetsujin \\"Iron-lady\\" for running 6km to school every morning to help her dog lose weight. She is depicted as a beautiful young woman, who catches the attention of her male friends and coworkers. Yamada is deeply in love with Mayama, but he does not return her feelings and repeatedly encourages her to find someone else. Later in the series, she is angered by Mayama's sudden protectiveness when he tries to shield her from his former boss, Nomiya. Yamada is close friends with Hagu, who addresses her by first name. At the end of the series, Yamada continues as a graduate student in art, while making pottery for Harada Design.

Once issued, it requires another member state to arrest and transfer a criminal suspect or sentenced person to the issuing state so that the person can be put on trial or complete a detention period. An EAW can only be issued for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution (not merely an investigation), or enforcing a custodial sentence. It can only be issued for offences carrying a minimum penalty of 1 year or more in prison. Where the sentence has already been passed, an EAW can only be issued if the prison term to be enforced is at least four months long. The introduction of the EAW system was intended to increase the speed and ease of extradition throughout EU countries by removing the political and administrative phases of decision- making which had characterised the previous system of extradition in Europe, and converting the process into a system run entirely by the judiciary. Since it was first implemented in 2004 the use of the EAW has risen. Member state country evaluation reports suggest that the number of EAWs issued has increased from approximately 3,000 in 2004 to 15,200 in 2009, but dropped back to 10,400 in 2013. Background Measures which sought to harmonise extradition rules across EU member states date from the mid-1990s when the EU instituted two treaties under the Maastricht Treaty which sought to streamline existing extradition procedures under the European Convention on Extradition. In 1999 the European Council further proposed to abolish formal extradition procedures for sentenced persons. However it was not until the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States that much more far- reaching proposals were mooted. While originally proposed as an anti-terrorist measure the European Arrest Warrant soon became applicable to a wide range of ordinary crimes. The political decision to adopt the EAW legislation was made at the Laeken European Council in December 2001, the text being finally agreed in June of the following year. The European Arrest Warrant was established by an EU framework decision in 2002.2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 Framework decisions were legal instruments of the third pillar of the European Community akin to directives and only take effect when implemented by EU member states by transposing them into their domestic law. The European Arrest Warrant replaced the 1957 European Convention on Extradition (ECE) which had previously governed extraditions between most member states, and various legal instruments which had been adopted to streamline the process of extradition under the ECE such as the 1989 agreement on the simplification of the transmission requests for extradition, the 1995 Convention on simplified extradition procedure, the 1996 Convention on extradition between Member States, and the provisions of the Schengen Agreement regarding extradition. The EAW Framework Decision came into force on 1 January 2004 in eight member states, namely Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. By 1 November 2004 all member states had implemented the legislation except Italy, which did so on 22 April 2005. Bulgaria and Romania implemented the Decision on their accession in 2007. When the UK exercised its opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice in 2014, its request to continue participating in the EAW was approved. Distinctive features There are several features of the European Arrest Warrant which distinguish it from the treaties and arrangements which previously governed extradition between EU member states. EAWs are not issued through diplomatic channels, they can be executed for a wide variety of offences without any requirement that the offence to which the warrant relates corresponds to an offence under the law of the state asked to execute the warrant, there is no exception for political, military or revenue offences, and there is no exception clause allowing a state to refuse to surrender its own nationals. =Double criminality= Double criminality is a feature of international extradition law by which states may refuse to extradite fugitives if the conduct which is alleged to have constituted a criminal offence in the state requesting extradition would not have resulted in the commission of a criminal offence in the state being asked to effect the extradition. Under the EAW Framework Decision, the requirement for double criminality is removed for a wide range of categories of crimes, and made a discretionary rather than a compulsory ground for a refusal to extradite for offences not falling within those categories. The categories within which are as follows: * Arson, * Computer-related crime, * Corruption, * Counterfeiting currency, * Counterfeiting and piracy of products, * Crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, * Environmental crime, including illicit trafficking in endangered animal species and in endangered plant species and varieties, * Facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence, * Forgery of means of payment, * Forgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein, * Fraud, including fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union, * Illicit trade in human organs and tissue, * Illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiques and works of art, * Illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters, * Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, * Illicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials, * Illicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives, * Kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking, * Laundering of the proceeds of crime, * Murder, grievous bodily injury, * Organised or armed robbery, * Participation in a criminal organisation, * Racism and xenophobia, * Rape, * Racketeering and extortion, * Sabotage * Sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, * Swindling, * Terrorism, * Trafficking in human beings, * Trafficking in stolen vehicles, * Unlawful seizure of aircraft or ships. The Framework Decision is silent as to whether secondary participation in, or an attempt to commit, an offence of the kind listed here itself excluded from the requirement for correspondence. Another issue which has arisen is the accuracy of a description of an offence as being in a category exempt from the requirement for correspondence, and whether the executing judicial authority is required to accept the issuing judicial authority's classification as definitive. =Surrender of nationals= Prior to the adoption of the EAW Framework Decision in 2002, 11 of the then 15 member states — namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,Made an absolute reservation under the European Convention on Extradition refusing the extradition of its nationals. Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Sweden — had domestic rules which prevented the extradition of their nationals. Although the Nordic EU members – Denmark, Finland, and Sweden – did allow the extradition of their nationals to each other and to other Nordic countries, they refused the extradition of both their nationals and the nationals of other Nordic countries elsewhere.Mathisen, Gjermund, \\"Nordic Cooperation and the European Arrest Warrant: Intra-Nordic Extradition, the Nordic Arrest Warrant and Beyond\\" 79 (2010) Nordic Journal of International Law 1 at 10. In addition seven of the 12 member states which joined between 2004 and 2007 – namely Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovenia – employed a similar prohibition prior to their accession. Under the Framework Decision, member states are precluded from refusing the surrender of their own nationals wanted for the purposes of prosecution, but they may condition the surrender of a requested person on his or her being returned to the issuing state to serve any sentence ultimately imposed. The Netherlands which requires issuing states to return both Dutch nationals and permanent residents, also requires issuing states to agree that any sentences imposed will be converted into those applicable under Dutch law using the 1995 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This has the effect of re-introducing the double- criminality requirement for Dutch nationals and permanent residents, as the conversion of a sentence imposed in an issuing state could not be converted into a comparable sentence by a Dutch court if the conduct constituting the criminal offence in the issuing state does not constitute a criminal offence in the Netherlands.Commission Staff Working Document Annex to the Report From The Commission based on Article 34 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (revised version) {COM(2006)8 final} 24 January 2006, page 13, SEC(2006)79. Grounds for refusal to execute warrant The EAW Framework Decision sets out the reasons by which the executing judicial authority must or may refuse to surrender a person subject to an arrest warrant. Many member states have enacted other reasons by which surrender may be refused which are not referred to in the Framework Decision. =Mandatory grounds under the Framework Decision= Under the Framework Decision the executing judicial authority must refuse to surrender the requested person if: * The alleged offence comes under the jurisdiction of the courts of the executing state and is the subject of an amnesty there, * The requested person has been acquitted in a member state of the European Union of an offence in respect of the same acts as contained in the arrest warrant, or was convicted of that offence and has served the sentence imposed (if any) for that offence, or * The requested person is below the age of criminal responsibility in the executing state.Article 3 of the Framework Decision. =Optional grounds under the Framework Decision= Under the Framework Decision the executing judicial authority may refuse to surrender the requested person if: * The requested person is being prosecuted in the executing member state for the same act; * The prosecutorial authorities in the executing state decided not to prosecute the requested person, or, having begun such a prosecution halted it; * The requested person was being prosecuted in the executing member state, that case having progressed to final judgement; * The act on which the EAW is based comes under the jurisdiction of the executing member state and would be statute-barred there; * The requested person was prosecuted in a third country, the final judgement having been made, provided that the sentence in respect of the offence (if one was imposed) had been served or may no longer be executed under the laws of the third country; * The offence was committed or alleged to have been committed in the territory of the executing state; or * The offence was committed or alleged to have been committed other than in the territory of the issuing state and the law of the executing state would not allow for the prosecution of the same offence if committed outside its territory. =Trials in absentia= In 2009 the Council of Ministers amended the EAW framework decision with the express intention of \\"enhancing the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial\\". Under the 2009 framework decision an executing judicial authority may refuse to execute a European Arrest Warrant unless the requested person: * was summoned in person and, knowing the time and place of the trial in due time and that judgement might be made against him or her if he or she failed to attend, failed to attend; * was not summoned in person but, it being unequivocally established that he or she was aware of the time and place of the trial in due time and that judgement might be made against him or her if he or she failed to attend, failed to attend; * knowing that a trial was scheduled, had instructed lawyers to defend the case, who duly did so; * was served with the judgement and told of his or her right to a retrial or appeal de novo, and decided not to contest the judgement or failed to request such a retrial or appeal within the applicable time limit; or * may request a retrial or make a de novo appeal upon his or her surrender.Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009 amending Framework Decisions 2002/584/JHA, 2005/214/JHA, 2006/783/JHA, 2008/909/JHA and 2008/947/JHA, thereby enhancing the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial (OJ L 81, 27.3.2009, p. 24). =Human rights= Article 3 of the Framework Decision which lists grounds upon which executing states must refuse to surrender a requested person does not expressly include any ground for refusing the surrender of a requested person if that surrender would infringe a person's human rights. However recitals (12) and (13) of the preamble and Article 1(3) do refer to human rights: In 2006, 20 of the then 25 member states included text which was based on at least one of these provisions or which explicitly referred to the European Convention on Human Rights, in their domestic implementing legislation. The others took the view that the rights exist independently from the Framework Decision. Fair Trials International (FTI), the London-based human rights non-governmental organisation, claims to have highlighted a number of cases which demonstrate that the European Arrest Warrant system is causing serious injustice and jeopardising the right to a fair trial. In particular, FTI allege that: * European Arrest Warrants have been issued many years after the alleged offence was committed. * Once warrants have been issued there is no effective way of removing them, even after extradition has been refused. * They have been used to send people to another EU member state to serve a prison sentence resulting from an unfair trial. * Warrants have been used to force a person to face trial when the charges are based on evidence obtained by police brutality. * Sometimes people surrendered under an Arrest Warrant have to spend months or even years in detention before they can appear in court to establish their innocence. =Conditional surrender= The Framework Decision also establishes the possibility for executing member states to request certain guarantees from issuing states prior to ordering the surrender of a requested person. Whether and how member states require such guarantees depends on the law of the member state in question. * Where a requested person is liable on conviction to life imprisonment, the executing state may make the surrender subject to the requested person having the legal right to apply for parole after having served twenty years. * Where a requested person is a national or a resident of the executing state, the executing state may make the surrender subject to the requested person being returned to the executing state to serve any prison sentence ultimately imposed.Article 5 of the Framework Decision as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009 amending Framework Decisions 2002/584/JHA, 2005/214/JHA, 2006/783/JHA, 2008/909/JHA and 2008/947/JHA, thereby enhancing the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial (OJ L 81, 27.3.2009, p. 24). Procedure =Issuing judicial authority= A European Arrest Warrant may only be issued by the competent judicial authority in an EU member state or a state with a special agreement with the EU. The issuing judicial authority must complete a form stating identity and nationality of the person sought, the nature and legal classification of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the alleged committal of the offence including when and where it was committed and the degree of participation of the person sought, and scale of penalties for the offence.Article 8 of the Framework Decision. Many member states have designated public prosecutors as their judicial authorities for the purposes of the framework decision. Such designations have been questioned before the British and Irish courts on the basis that in order for an authority to be judicial it should be a court or judge. In both countries, the designated issuing authority is a judge. However the courts of each have rejected these arguments.In Ireland in Minister for Justice v. Altaravicius (No. 2) [2007] 2 IR 265, and in the UK in Enander v Governor of Brixton Prison [2005] EWHC 3036 (Admin), [2006] 1 CMLR 37. In Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority the High Court of England and Wales found that: On appeal, the UK's Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the High Court and found that, when comparing different language versions, the framework decision demonstrated an intention to regard public prosecutors as judicial authorities and that the conduct of the member states since its enactment confirmed this interpretation. =Transmission= Unlike traditional extradition arrangements, EAWs need not be transmitted to any particular state. The intent of the Framework Decision is that EAWs be immediately recognised by all member states once issued. When a person subject of an EAW is found within the jurisdiction of a member state and arrested, that member state is required by the Framework Decision to execute the warrant. If the whereabouts of the person sought are known, the EAW may be transmitted directly to the designated central authority of that member state. Otherwise the issuing judicial authority may seek the assistance of the European Judicial Network in circulating the warrant, may seek to issue an alert under the Schengen Information System, or may seek the services of Interpol.Article 10 of the Framework Decision. =Minimum threshold= The EAW Framework Decision requires that a warrant can only be issued when an offence is punishable by imprisonment or a detention order for a maximum period of at least one year, or in conviction cases, where the remaining term of imprisonment is four months or more. This can nonetheless include a wide variety of trivial offences. In 2007, a report commissioned by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers noted that EAWs had been issued for such offences as possession of 0.45 grams of cannabis, possession of 3 ecstasy tablets, theft of two car tyres, driving under the influence of alcohol where the limit was not significantly exceeded, and theft of a piglet. The report concluded that it would be appropriate to have a discussion at EU level on the proportionate issuance of European Arrest Warrants. =Arrest= While the manner in which the arrest of a person the subject of an EAW is not specified in the Framework Decision, once arrested, he or she has the right to be informed of the warrant, its contents, and the person's right to consent to his or her surrender to the member state that issued the warrant. The Framework Decision also provides that the requested person have the right to the assistance of legal counsel and to an interpreter \\"in accordance with the national law of the executing Member State\\".Article 11. =Time limits= The Framework Decision prescribes time limits for the making of a final decision to a surrender request. Where a requested person consents to his or her surrender, the executing judicial authority should make a final decision within ten days of such a consent. Where a requested person refuses to consent to his or her surrender, the executing judicial authority should make a final decision within 60 days of the arrest.Article 17 of the Framework Decision. In 2011 the European Commission reported that the average time for the surrender of persons who consented was 16 days while the average time for those who did not consent was 48.6 days. Specialty A state wishing to prosecute a surrendered person for offences committed before his or her surrender, or extradite a surrendered person to a third state, must, subject to certain exception, obtain the permission of the executing judicial authority. Such a request is made in the same form as a European Arrest Warrant, and granted or refused using the same rules which determine whether surrender would be granted or refused.Articles 27(4) and 28(4) of the framework decision. This requirement is referred to as the principle of 'specialty' and is intended to ensure that a state cannot seek the surrender of a person for an extraditable offence whilst intending to prosecute that person for a non-extraditable offence once surrendered, or extradite the surrendered person to a third state for an offence which would not have been extraditable offence from the original executing state. By default the principle of 'specialty' applies to all persons surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant unless the executing judicial authority indicates otherwise. However this position may be reversed where both the issuing and the executing states have made declarations to that effect.Articles 27(1) and 28(1)of the framework decision. The permission of the executing state is not required: * For offences which could not incur custodial sentences, or which could only incur them as a result of the failure to pay a fine, * Where the surrender person was discharged from custody and having had the opportunity to leave that state (i.e. the original issuing state) remained there for 45 days, or left that state only to return,Articles 27(3)(a) and 28(2)(a) of the framework decision. * The surrendered person renounced his or her right to specialty either before or after his or her surrender,Articles 27(3)(e) and (f), and 28(2)(c) of the framework decision. * Where the person is sought by another state pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant and consents to being surrendered to that state.Article 28(2)(b) of the framework decision. Controversy Since its implementation in 2004, the EAW system has been occasionally criticised for inappropriate or disproportionate use. Following a report by an internal working party, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union suggested in 2007 that it would be appropriate to have a discussion at EU level on the principle of proportionality which is outset in article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and how to take this principle into consideration by judicial authorities when issuing a European arrest warrant.http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/jul/eu-eaw-evaluation.pdf EAWs have been issued for minor offences such as possession of 0.45 grams of cannabis; theft of two car tires; driving a car under the influence of alcohol, where the limit was not significantly exceeded (0.81 mg/l) and the theft of a piglet. In the UK, persons arrested under an EAW have been extradited for minor offences such as the stealing of ten chickens (Romania), unintentionally receiving a stolen mobile phone (Poland), and theft of £20 worth of petrol (Czech Republic). At the other extreme, the EAW has failed in some cases. The Irish Supreme Court refused to extradite an Irish citizen to Hungary who was alleged to have killed two children through negligent driving. While the Irish Court never questioned the facts of the case or the fairness or outcome of the Hungarian trial, it decided that the person did not technically \\"flee\\" from Hungary, only \\"failed to return\\", having left the country with the consent of the Hungarian authorities; therefore, the legal requirements for extradition under an EAW had not been established. However, the requirement that the person have \\"fled\\" the requesting jurisdiction has since been removed from Irish law, and a new warrant has been issued by the Hungarian authorities. In the case of Carles Puigdemont (wanted for sedition in connection with the 2017 Catalan independence referendum), some MEPs and legal commentators criticised the Spanish Government for appearing to have opportunistically issued and withdrawn his European Arrest Warrant based on the likelihood of its success in different EU member states Puigdemont was travelling through.

The term is most used in phonetics and phonology to refer to the smallest elements in a language, and this usage can be synonymous with the term phone. In spoken languages, segments will typically be grouped into consonants and vowels, but the term can be applied to any minimal unit of a linear sequence meaningful to the given field of analysis, such as a mora or a syllable in prosodic phonology, a morpheme in morphology, or a chereme in sign language analysis. Segments are called \\"discrete\\" because they are, at least at some analytical level, separate and individual, and temporally ordered. Segments are generally not completely discrete in speech production or perception, however. The articulatory, visual and acoustic cues that encode them often overlap. Examples of overlap for spoken languages can be found in discussions of phonological assimilation, coarticulation, and other areas in the study of phonetics and phonology, especially autosegmental phonology. Other articulatory, visual or acoustic cues, such as prosody (tone, stress), and secondary articulations such as nasalization, may overlap multiple segments and cannot be discretely ordered with them. These elements are known as suprasegmentals.  Types  In phonetics, the smallest perceptible segment is a phone. In phonology, there is a subfield of segmental phonology that deals with the analysis of speech into phonemes (or segmental phonemes), which correspond fairly well to phonetic segments of the analysed speech. The segmental phonemes of sign language (formally called \\"cheremes\\") are visual movements of hands, face, and body. They occur in a distinct spatial and temporal order. The SignWriting script represents the spatial order of the segments with a spatial cluster of graphemes. Other notations for sign language use a temporal order that implies a spatial order.  Marginal segments  When analyzing the inventory of segmental units in any given language, some segments will be found to be marginal, in the sense that they are only found in onomatopoeic words, interjections, loan words, or a very limited number of ordinary words, but not throughout the language. Marginal segments, especially in loan words, are often the source of new segments in the general inventory of a language.  Suprasegmentals  Some contrastive elements of speech cannot be easily analyzed as distinct segments but rather belong to a syllable or word. These elements are called suprasegmental, and include intonation and stress. In some languages nasality and vowel harmony are considered suprasegmental or prosodic by some phonologists.

The first match began less than two weeks after the end of World War II in Europe, and the matches were embraced by the public of England as a way to get back to their way of life from before the war. The matches are known as the \\"Victory Tests\\", but they were never given Test match status by the participating Boards of Control, because the Australian Cricket Board feared their side was not strong enough to compete with a near Test- strength England, so the games only had first class status. In all, the teams played five three-day matches, two of which were won by each side with one drawn. 367,000 people attended the matches at Lord's (three matches), Old Trafford and Bramall Lane (one each), with the final game at Lord's attracting a then-record 93,000 people for a single three-day match. Australian Services XI The Australian side was an amalgam of an RAAF XI, which had already been stationed in England during the war, and another group of mostly AIF soldiers from Australia. The players were deliberately stationed with each other in England for the express purpose of forming a cricket team to tour the country, with Australian prime minister John Curtin pushing for the immediate resumption of international cricket after the war was over. The team was officially a military unit, commanded by Squadron Leader Stan Sismey, the team's wicket-keeper. Lindsay Hassett was the on-field captain. Only one player in the side, future Test captain Lindsay Hassett, had any previous Test match experience, and the rest of the side was made up mostly of Australian Sheffield Shield players. Keith Miller, at the time only considered a promising batsman with Victoria, played what many consider to be his 'breakout' series in the Victory Tests, ensuring that when he returned to Australia he would have a place in the Australian national team now referred to as The Invincibles. Graham Williams, the team's main strike bowler, had only been released from a German prisoner of war camp weeks before the series started, and played at 31 kg (68 lb) below his pre-war playing weight. In between overs he drank glasses of glucose and water to keep his energy up, but when he was unable to bowl Miller took his place. The Australian team, despite being split by rank and service, all took their place in the side in good spirit and not much was made of the fact that Hassett, a warrant officer who was outranked by almost every other member of the team, was appointed captain. English side The English side's batting line-up was strong enough to be considered Test-strength, with players like Len Hutton, Wally Hammond, Les Ames, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook, all of whom played Test cricket for England. Hutton held the record for the highest individual Test innings at the time with the 364 that he scored against Australia in 1938, and Hammond boasted 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.45 over his career, despite being over 40 by the time the Victory Tests were played. But although the English batting side was far superior to the Australians, they only managed to score over 300 runs in one innings for the entire Victory Test tour. Their bowling was seen as their weakness, and indeed a lot of changes were made to the bowling attack throughout the series. It worked for the last match of the series, when Australia were kept to under 250 runs in both of their innings, but none of the bowlers - bar seam bowler Dick Pollard, who took 25 wickets in his four matches - were very consistent, or indeed selected with any regularity. George Pope took eight wickets in the second match, only to miss the third, and then came back to take six in the fourth match. Series summary The series was drawn 2-2, with one match drawn. =First match= =Second match= =Third match= =Fourth match= =Fifth match= After the Victory Tests Following on from the success of the tour of England, the Australian Services XI traveled through India and Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) for four months at the request of Australian external affairs minister Dr H.V. Evatt, before returning to Australia to play against Sheffield Shield state sides. The gruelling schedule resulted in many players in the Services side playing well below their capabilities, and by the time they were back in Australia they were routinely beaten easily by the local teams. However, the importance of the Victory Test tour as a whole cannot be understated, because it helped people get back to their normal lives after the war, and unearthed some of the great cricketers of the time.

He has been elected as a member of the National Assembly four consecutive times between 1990–2007, having served as Federal Minister for Trade and Commerce from 2002–2007 and as Chairman Board of Investment from 1997–1999. His father General Akhtar Abdur Rehman headed the ISI from 1979–1987, eventually going on to become Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Armed Forces, while his brother Senator Haroon Akhtar Khan served as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Revenue from 2015–2018. Humayun is the Founder and Chairman of the Institute for Policy Reform and along with his brothers owns one of the largest conglomerates in Pakistan, comprising Tandlianwala Sugar Mills, Superior Textile Mill, and Lotte Akhtar Beverages (PepsiCo Franchise). Business =Lotte Akhtar Beverages= Humayun along with his brothers decided to move back to Pakistan in 1988 after the death of their father. The Akhtar brothers along with their cousin Jahangir Khan Tareen and his brother in law Makhdoom Ahmed Mehmood together bought Riaz Bottlers (Bottling and Distribution Franchise for PepsiCo beverages in Pakistan) from former Chief Minister of Punjab Sadiq Hussain Qureshi. The consortium managed to turn around the fortunes of Riaz Bottlers from bankruptcy to being the standout company in the beverage industry with key sponsorship deals such as that with the Pakistan Cricket Team and a vast portfolio of beverages including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7-Up, Aquafina, Mirinda, Slice, Sting. In 2018, South Korean chaebol Lotte Chilsung acquired a controlling stake in Riaz Bottlers (now known as Lotte Akhtar Beverages) although the Akhtar brothers maintain a significant minority share and are Lotte's strategic partner in Pakistan.https://propakistani.pk/2017/12/26/pepsi-brands-bottled-supplied- lotte-chilsung-beverage-pakistan/ =Tandlianwala Sugar Mills= After years of unprecedented success in the beverage industry, the Akhtar brothers entered the sugar industry and later expanded into production of its downstream products such as ethanol and carbon dioxide. Today, Tandlianwala Sugar Mills is the second largest publicly listed producer of sugar and its allied products on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in terms of revenue, market capitalization, production, and capacity while it is also the largest exporter of ethanol in the country, comprising 17% of Pakistan's total ethanol exports. The group includes three sugar mills in Tandlianwala, Muzaffargarh, and Dera Ismail Khan with a combined crushing capacity of 48,000 Tons of Cane per day (Annual Production of 470,000 M. Tons); two ethanol distilleries in Tandlianwala and Muzaffargarh with production capacity of 255,000 liters per day (Annual Production of 84 Million Liters), and a Carbon Dioxide Recovery plant with capacity of 48 Tons Per Day (Annual Production of 16,000 Tons). Think Tank In March 2014, the Akhtar Brothers founded a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank called the Institute for Policy Reform which regularly publishes research reports, analysis, briefs, and fact sheets on key public policy issues concerning Pakistan with a particular focus on economic policy, national security, and international relations. IPR's Board of Advisors includes prominent personalities from various fields of Pakistani society including Diplomats, Lawyers, Legislators, Academic Scholars, Corporate Executives, Military Officers, and Bureaucrats. Political career =Formation of PML-Q (1999–2002)= After the military coup in 1999 in which Nawaz Sharif was overthrown by General Pervez Musharraf, Humayun Akhtar along with many of Nawaz Sharifs close aides were under house arrest for months. For two years the National Accountability Bureau launched thorough investigations against Humayun's family and placed him on the Exit Control List. After being cleared of all allegations leveled against him, Humayun resumed his political career in 2001. In 2002, General Pervez Musharraf who by then had also become the President of Pakistan promised that there would be General Elections in October. Because Nawaz Sharif had been exiled to Saudi Arabia and the military establishment gave the impression that he was gone for good, many of his most prominent party leaders including Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Ijaz-ul-Haq, Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad, Mian Azhar and Humayun Akhtar Khan formed a new party called Pakistan Muslim League- Quaid-e-Azam. Humayun contested from constituency NA-125 which was in fact part of what was once called NA-93, the constituency he won from in 1993. This time his main opponents were Akram Zaki of PML (N) and Naveed Chaudhry of PPP. =Prime Ministerial Candidacy (2002–2004)= In 2002 when PML (Q) was forming its government, Humayun Akhtar was one of the candidates considered for the post of Prime Minister. However, President Musharraf and the PML-Q eventually decided to choose the Prime Minister from one of the smaller provinces and hence gave the honor to Zafarullah Khan Jamali of Balochistan. By early 2004, it was clear that Jamali had fallen out of favor with President Musharraf and his own party members. Jamali did not support Musharraf's decision to keep on his uniform amongst other things while Musharraf was fed up of Jamali's incompetence and poor governance. By May 2004, the party decided to sack Jamali and in his place a number of potential candidates were listed. After many high level consultations between the President and his close political and military aides, it was decided that Humayun was the best choice to lead the nation. Although Humayun had strong backing of the Pakistan Army and the ISI as many of the top generals had served under his father who led these institutions in the 1980s, his own party leaders the Chaudhrys of Gujrat proved to be the last hurdle in his nomination as they fought tooth and nail to ensure that he does not become the next Prime Minister. Party President Chaudhry Shujaat went to the extent of asking Musharraf to delay the announcement of the new Prime Minister by three weeks till the budget session concludes. Many political analysts believe that the main reason behind the delay was to postpone Humayun's candidacy as the Chaudhry's felt that he had intentions of hijacking the party from them and as a result threatening Pervaiz Elahi's own political ambitions of eventually becoming Prime Minister after the next election. Eventually Musharraf adhered to the pressure and the only other viable option for Musharraf was Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz who was a Senator, not a Member of Parliament. Eventually, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was made interim Prime Minister for two months and it was decided that Shaukat Aziz would contest an election for the national assembly via by- election. Shortly after contesting and winning the by-election, Shaukat Aziz replaced Chaudhry Shujaat as Prime Minister. =Alliance with PML-N (2012–2013)= In May 2012 the Likeminded Group formed an alliance with the PML (N) in a bid to unite all Muslim League factions under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, with the aim of defeating the PTI and the ruling coalition of PPP and PML (Q) in the upcoming general elections.

However, days before the election tickets were finalized, PML (N) violated the agreement it signed in 2012 and Humayun did not receive a PML (N) ticket from either of the two constituencies although his brother Haroon was accommodated in June 2015 as a Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Revenue and was elected as a Senator on a PML (N) ticket in the 2018 Senate Election.

Giovanni is best known for writing the music for the 1973 British horror film The Wicker Man.  Career  Giovanni wrote the music for The Wicker Man soundtrack, also writing the lyrics and singing \\"Landlord's Daughter\\" and \\"Gently Johnny\\", where he appears in later cuts of the film. He also sang \\"Corn Riggs\\", adapting the lyrics from a Robert Burns song. The music was played by a group of six musicians, Gary Carpenter, Peter Brewis, Andrew Tompkins, Ian Cutler, Michael Cole, and Bernard Murray, who used the name Magnet for their collaboration. The group used a combination of traditional and modern (electric) instrumentation; some parts of the soundtrack were augmented by brass instruments. After this Giovanni returned to New York where his play The Crucifer of Blood was performed. It was later filmed for TV. Giovanni also composed a musical entitled Shot Thru The Heart, which has only performed at Detroit's Birmingham Theatre before closing.  Biography  Giovanni did graduate studies at The Catholic University of America Speech and Drama Department under Rev. Gilbert V. Hartke, OP.

It was discovered by Grote Reber in 1939. In 1951, Cygnus A, along with Cassiopeia A, and Puppis A were the first \\"radio stars\\" identified with an optical source. Of these, Cygnus A became the first radio galaxy; the other two being nebulae inside the Milky Way.Astrophysical Journal, \\"Identification of the Radio Sources in Cassiopeia (A), Cygnus A, and Puppis A\\", Baade, W.; Minkowski, R., vol. 119, p.206, January 1954, , In 1953 Roger Jennison and M K Das Gupta showed it to be a double source. Like all radio galaxies, it contains an active galactic nucleus. The supermassive black hole at the core has a mass of . Images of the galaxy in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum show two jets protruding in opposite directions from the galaxy's center. These jets extend many times the width of the portion of the host galaxy which emits radiation at visible wavelengths. At the ends of the jets are two lobes with \\"hot spots\\" of more intense radiation at their edges. These hot spots are formed when material from the jets collides with the surrounding intergalactic medium. In 2016, a radio transient was discovered 460 parsecs away from the center of Cygnus A. Between 1989 and 2016, the object, cospatial with a previously-known infrared source, exhibited at least an eightfold increase in radio flux density, with comparable luminosity to the brightest known supernova. Due to the lack of measurements in the intervening years, the rate of brightening is unknown, but the object has remained at a relatively constant flux density since its discovery. The data are consistent with a second supermassive black hole orbiting the primary object, with the secondary having undergone a rapid accretion rate increase. The inferred orbital timescale is of the same order as the activity of the primary source, suggesting the secondary may be perturbing the primary and causing the outflows.  References  * Harris, D.

Classified as a \\"skill with prize\\" (SWP) machine, each itbox terminal typically includes 25 different games. Each game costs 50p or £1 to play and lasts between 10 seconds and several minutes. From most of these games it is possible to win modest cash prizes. Although strictly the name 'itbox' refers only to Leisure Link-made terminals, the name is often casually applied as a genericized trademark to other SWP terminals such as Paragon SWP, Gamesnet, ind:e and Fatbox.  Games  The games on itbox are largely question-and-answer based where the player will need to answer a varying number of questions (often from a range of subject categories) correctly before he or she can opt to collect a small prize (normally £1) or gamble for a chance to win a larger prize by answering further questions. = Question-and-answer based = *Pub Quiz - the simplest itbox game. It consists of a total of six rounds of 4 or 5 questions each, with prizes ranging from £1 (usually on completion of the third round, but occasionally after the second round) to a £10 jackpot. The player starts with one \\"try again\\" and a \\"change category\\" option, and can gain bonuses such as \\"pass\\" or \\"cheat\\", which automatically reveals the correct answer during a bonus round. Occasionally a cash prize can also be won in this way. Pub Quiz differs from most Itbox quiz games in that once a prize is attained, it cannot be lost and does therefore not need to be \\"collected\\". Pub Quiz also often features comedy answers which will be obviously wrong, especially in the first round. *Bullseye - This game is based on an old television programme of the same name. It became, and remains, one of the more popular Question and Answer games on the itbox. Players must skillfully throw darts into a dart board to achieve points towards their target score. If this score is achieved, then the player is entered into the prize round, where they are able to throw darts into a \\"prize\\" board to gain cash prizes. *Every Loser Wins - Has a similar format to Pub Quiz, but requiring players to answer questions wrongly rather than correctly. Players start with a \\"change category\\" option but no \\"try agains\\", though an \\"extra life\\" option is available during the bonus round, along with \\"change category\\" and, occasionally, a cash prize. Unusually, the 2/3 odds given on each question means players can make good progress simply by guessing their way through the game. *Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? - Based on the popular television programme, Millionaire enables gamers to sit with Chris Tarrant in order to win £20. The completion of the Fastest Finger First round opens up bonuses such as 'Ask the Audience' and '50:50', which can be invaluable in helping the player reach the payout questions. A recent 2006 edition has been launched, with less time available to answer individual questions but improved odds of gaining Fastest Finger bonuses, as well as more video footage of Chris Tarrant. *Monopoly - The latest \\"Hot Property\\" edition of this game requires players to attain a points target (usually between 5000 and 6000 points) and then play and endgame to win money. Points are accumulated by landing on properties, getting bonuses from \\"Chance\\" and \\"Community Chest\\" cards, and playing mini-games. Once a property has been landed on, a house is won (unlike in previous versions of Monopoly where a full set needed to be owned for houses to be available) and its points value increases to its base value plus its rent value with one house (hotels give a similar bonus). Collecting all 4 stations awards a cashpot prize. The endgame requires a player to choose three random properties from those accumulated during the main game. The game then offers a prize based on those properties, or the player can pick one and win its cash equivalent instead. *Deal or No Deal - A popular new addition to the Itbox selection. Presented by Noel Edmonds, the player must choose boxes and answer trivia questions to accumulate enough points to play a final cash round. The points target can range from 10000 to 90000, but is usually between 30000 and 60000, depending on how likely the Itbox is to pay out. The final cash round has no questions and requires to play, essentially, a very small-scale version of 'Deal or No Deal' with prizes ranging from 10p to a £20 jackpot. In some pubs the game has proved so popular that the minimum play is £1 and not 50p. *Deal or No Deal - No Questions - A new version of the game for Itbox. Presented by Noel Edmonds, the player is presented with a succession of box values, and must light up all the boxes by accepting the values that appear and discarding the ones that don't within a given time limit. There are also bonus boxes that give more time or an extra box value. If all the boxes are lit, the player progresses to the same final cash round as in the original Deal or No Deal. *Take It or Leave It - Based on the Challenge game show presented by Richard Arnold, launched in October 2007, in which the player must answer 10 questions to get to a final cash round. The questions each come with an answer, and the player must \\"take it\\" (if they believe it to be correct) or \\"leave it\\" (if it is incorrect). In between each question is a round which decides the total prize value. Players are presented with a selection of 20 \\"vaults\\" containing values from 10p to £3, and two \\"booby traps\\" which end the game. Players choose two vaults, then must decide which one to take based on the amount revealed in the first vault. The total prize accumulates through 10 such rounds. In the final round, players are presented with 6 \\"vaults\\", each containing different shares of the total prize fund, which are then scrambled and hidden. Players must answer a question correctly to choose a vault. They can then collect the share of the prize fund revealed, or reject it in an attempt to answer a further question correctly and open a vault containing a larger share. Any incorrect answer given in either stage ends the game with no prize. *1 vs 100 - Based on the 'National Lottery' programme of the same name, this game involves 100 \\"contestants\\" which players need to eliminate by answering questions. Each correct answer eliminates a number of \\"contestants\\", usually between 3 and 10. Players have two \\"dodge\\" options, similar to a pass, and one \\"double\\" option, which doubles the number of \\"contestants\\" eliminated by one correct answer. Once all the \\"contestants\\" have been eliminated, the player progresses to a cash round and can win a prize from 25p to £20 by eliminating 9 of the 10 prizes offered. *The Million Pound Drop - Based on the Channel 4 game show presented by Davina McCall, this game requires players to answer eight rounds of questions to win cash prizes of up to £10. At the start of the game, the player is given twenty money 'bundles' of 50,000 points; each is worth 50p of the maximum £10 prize available. The player must select a category from a choice of two at the start of each round, and then answer up to four questions on that topic. Each question has four possible answers, represented by four trapdoors. The player must place their money bundles on the answer they believe to be correct, within the time limit. Any bundles not placed after this time are lost from the game. The answer is then revealed and any bundles placed on wrong answers are removed. Play continues in this way until the player either answers the final question of the eighth round correctly, thus winning the cash value of the bundles they have remaining, or loses all their bundles and the game ends. *The Colour of Money - Based on the ITV gameshow of the same name presented by Chris Tarrant, this game features 20 different coloured 'cash machines', each holding a value between 1,000 and 20,000 points. Players pick a card at the start of the game to determine their points target, and then must reach that target by selecting machines. Some machines contain up to four questions which must be answered correctly to continue. For every incorrect answer given to a question, a 'Try Again' is lost. The machine will then begin counting upwards in increments of 1,000 points. The player must stop the count before the machine 'busts' and they lose all the points for that go. If they stop the machine before this happens, the points go towards their target. If the player stops the machine at the exact total the machine contains, the player receives a bonus 'Try Again'. If they reach their points target, the player progresses to the cash round and carries through any remaining 'Try Agains'. The cash round follows an identical format, but with cash values in each machine, ranging from 10p to £20. The maximum cash win of the game is capped at £20, despite the total value of the machines in the cash round being significantly higher. The game ends when the player gives an incorrect answer with no 'Try Agains' remaining. If this happens in the cash round, the player wins the prize money they have amassed so far. *High Stakes - Based on the ITV gameshow of the same name hosted by Jeremy Kyle, this game requires the player to progress, row-by-row, across the 'High Stakes' grid, by avoiding traps which will end the game. On each of the six rows of the grid are seven consecutive numbers (e.g. 27 to 33), and each row contains an increasing number of traps, starting with one trap on the first row, up to six traps on the sixth and final row. Increasing cash prizes, up to £10, are awarded the further the player progresses, usually from the fourth row onwards. To avoid each trap, the player is given a clue that points to the trap number on that row. For example, if the clue was 'AVOID the number of passenger capsules on the London Eye.', the player must select any other number on the row EXCEPT 32, since that is the number of passenger capsules on the London Eye. Once the player has successfully avoided each trap, they are asked between 1 and 4 trivia questions. They must AVOID the correct answer to every question they are asked (by selecting a wrong answer from the options available). Along the way, several 'safe' numbers (i.e. numbers that are revealed NOT to be traps) reveal tokens that can be collected in order to win an extra life. A life is lost if the player selects the CORRECT answer to a question. The game ends when a player does this with no lives remaining. *In the Grid - Based on the In the Grid television programme presented by Les Dennis. Players attempt to reach a target score that is displayed before the game begins. The player then starts selecting squares on a 4x4 grid, each with a 3-answer multiple-choice question behind it. If the question is answered correctly, the colour of the square is revealed and points are added or taken away accordingly. Gold squares (Cash squares) increase the player's score by the amount shown, Green squares (Bonus squares) increase the player's score by the percentage shown, Purple squares (Steal squares) allow the player to steal a percentage of points from the Steal Pot (starting at 1000 points, but increasing when the player picks a Penalty square), Red squares (Penalty squares) decrease the player's score by the percentage shown and adds it to the Steal Pot and the one Black square (Bankrupt square) reduces the player's score to zero and must start over. The player is also given 2 Reveals to use at any time. These can be used in 2 ways. The first is to reveal the colour of an unrevealed square to determine if it will be good or bad, and the second is used to reveal the correct answer to the question presented to the player. The player is also given 1 Try Again, should they answer any question incorrectly. After a few squares have been played, the player is presented with a New Grid option. If the grid is looking less favourable to the player, they can press the New Grid button and a new grid of squares will be presented to the player and randomised, allowing them to carry on playing, however Reveals and Try Agains are not restored. If the score quota is reached, the player moves on to the MegaGrid round. The player is presented with a 5x5 grid and is told how many Gold and Black squares are in it. As long as the player keeps picking Gold squares, they move up a money tree starting at 25p and ending at a jackpot of £40. A Black square does not wipe the player's winnings out, but does end the game. = Skill / card games = Some games on itbox do not involve questions at all; examples of these are: *Word Soup - (a new name for Word Up) Here the computer generates a \\"random\\" matrix of letters with different point values based upon the machine's 'willingness' to pay out, players must form English words from adjoining letters in order to reach a predetermined prize target which ranges from 450-2100 points. '''' *Triple Towers - The solitaire card game generically known as tri peaks, in which a random sequence of playing cards are dealt face down in a tri-pyramid pattern. The player is then dealt 24 cards with which he must clear all the pyramid cards within a set time by creating sequential runs (in this game Ace is both high and low). Competing pub/bar game manufacturers call their versions of this very popular game Tri-Towers and Merry Maidens, among others. *Trickshot Pool - A computerised simulation of 8-ball pool. Players must pot a pre- determined number of their own colour balls (between 4-8). If successful the player has a chance to win a cash prize by completing a trickshot by potting an awkwardly positioned black ball determined by the computer. (Standard 8-ball pool rules apply with the exception that potting the 8ball off the break is considered a foul.) Recent modifications appear to have reintroduced more skill into this title by tweaking the CPU player's shot choices. *Crystal Maze - A game where the player must use various skills to win crystals and proceed to the 'Dome', in the same way that contestants did on the hit TV show – The Crystal Maze. Presented by Richard O'Brien, the player must torpedo ships, connect pipes and re-arrange words amongst mini-games to gain access to the final round where the amount of crystals collected translates as time. To win the prize the user must collect gold tickets whilst missing silver, which are deducted from the final total. (This title has been largely superseded on later itbox releases.) *itbox Soccer - A test of knowledge based on the sport of football, Itbox Soccer is a word based game where players must fill in the blanks to complete the name of a player or other soccer-related term. The amount of money won is determined by the number of points the player accumulates by successfully answering questions and filling in the missing letters. *Cluedo - A game where the player has a choice of rolls on a dice to choose from. The aim is to find out the suspect, the weapon and the room the murder took place. If this is done, the player wins £20. You can also win money for landing on all 6 suspects for £5 or the amount of rooms entered- The amount of rooms before money can be collected varies, it can be the 2nd to the 5th room entered. You must be in the correct room and guess the murderer and weapon correctly to win £20. *Skill Ball Bingo - A game where players get a standard English Bingo card, whilst 105 bingo balls jump around on the top part of the screen. when a Ball drops into a hole at the bottom of the screen, it appears stationary and the player must press the accept button if the ball is on the card or reject if it isn't. Also in the machine, there are 5 star balls, these activate the Jackpot collection if all 5 are collected. there is also a skull ball which must be rejected otherwise the player loses time and any star balls collected and finally a \\"?\\" ball, which gives the player added time. If a player accepts a ball not on the card,the skull ball or rejects a ball on the card,\\"?\\" ball or star ball, the player gets a time penalty of 5 seconds.To win on the game, players must get a line. the amount that a player can win is on screen for each prize level, but as time decreases, the amount drops until the game is up or they win that prize. a person can win for this is £1-5 for a single line collected,£6-15 for 2 lines or £10-30 for a full house. If the jackpot mode is activated and a player gets all the star balls and a full house, they win the jackpot of £50(£100 on some machines). The odds of getting a line is roughly 5-1. Every 100th game or so an extra £5 ball is added. If this is potted, then the person automatically wins £5 into the collect fund. Past games that are no longer available, except on older machines, include The Two Towers, and Dungeons and Dragons. = Tournament games = In early 2006 a new style of game was introduced to itbox terminals. These tournament games pit players playing on different terminals around the country against each other for larger cash prizes than the stand-alone games. The national high score tables are reportedly updated in real time.Leisure link itbox sales sheet retrieved 27 February 2007 (PDF)  Prizes  In accordance with gambling legislation the standard payout percentage of itboxes is 30%, although operators can elect to set this at 40% or 50%. Many of the terminals are fixed minimum payout as with all fruit machines. Each game has a prize structure which varies according to whether that game has recently paid out more than it should have according to the fixed payout percentage. Most games have a nominal jackpot of £20 although attaining this requires considerable skill from the player and cooperation from the software. Occasionally the operator underestimates the dedication of quiz machine players, or the software on a particular game is defective. When this happens, fast-acting players can empty machines of the jackpot with minimum difficulty.

January 01 1654 - January 01 1709) was a 17th- century English entomologist from Tickenham in Somerset. Entomologist Glanville fritillary Lady Glanville was particularly interested in butterflies. She collected large numbers of butterfly specimens, many of which survive as some of the earliest specimens kept in the Natural History Museum. She would beat the hedges for \\"a parcel of wormes\\", neighbours reported. The Glanville fritillary butterfly is named after her. Personal life Lady Glanville married to a Lincolnshire landowner. She later discovered the Lincolnshire Fritillary in the Lincolnshire Wolds – which was renamed the Glanville Fritillary ─ one of only two native British butterflies named after British entomologists. Lady Eleanor Glanville died on the 1st of January 1709 aged 55 years old which was 311 years ago to date as her anniversary of her death. Biography Eleanor Glanville was the daughter of William Goodricke and Eleanor Davis Poyntz, daughter of Rice Davis and Mary Pitt. Eleanor Davis was the widow of Nicholas Poyntz, a descendant of the Poyntz family, anciently feudal barons of Curry Mallet in Somerset, later of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire. Eleanor Goodrick married Edmund Ashfield and after his death Richard Glanville.

A., & Hillocks, R. J. (2002). Pests, diseases, and weeds of Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum: a review. International Journal of Pest Management, 48(1), 39-48.] It has low water and nutrient requirements, and therefore can make use of otherwise uncultivated lands.[Strezov, V., Evans, T. J., & Hayman, C. (2008). Thermal conversion of elephant grass Pennisetum purpureum Schum) to bio-gas, bio-oil and charcoal. Bioresources Technology, 99, 8394-8399.] Historically, this wild species has been used primarily for grazing, recently, however, it has been used as part of a push–pull agricultural pest management strategy. Napier grasses improve soil fertility, and protect arid land from soil erosion. It is also utilized for firebreaks, windbreaks, in paper pulp production and most recently to produce bio-oil, biogas and charcoal. Description Cenchrus purpureus (or napier grass) is a monocot C4 perennial grass in the family Poaceae. It is tall and forms in robust bamboo-like clumps. It is a heterozygous plant, but seeds rarely fully form; more often it reproduces vegetatively through stolons which are horizontal shoots above the soil that extend from the parent plant to offspring. It requires low water and nutrient inputs. Napier grass plantations produce about 40 tonnes of dry biomass per hectare per year with an average energy content 18 GJ per tonne,See page 831: and the grass can be harvested many times per year. Generally, the grass is harvested in relatively short intervals (every 1 to 3 months) when it is to be used as fodder for animals (its main use), and relatively long intervals (4–12 months) when used for bioenergy. Longer intervals increases the stem/leaf ratio, making the forage harder to chew and digest, but in many cases the annual dry yield increases. The grass can reach a height of 7-8 meters after 4 months of growth. It produces best growth between 25 and 40 °C, and little growth below about 15 °C, with growth ceasing at 10 °C. Tops are killed by frost, but plants re-grow with the onset of warm, moist conditions. Grows from sea level to over 2,000 m elevation. It can be propagated through seeds, however as seed production is inconsistent, collection is difficult. Alternatively, it can be planted through stem cuttings of the stolons. The cuttings can be planted by inserting them along furrows 75 cm apart, both along and between rows.[Aminah, A. Wong, C. C. & Eng P. K. (1997). Techniques for rapid vegetative multiplication for pasture species and commercial production. Regional Forage Development, FAO, Rome, pp167-178.] Yield Yield depends on management techniques (e.g. fertilizer), soil quality, rain, sunshine and temperature. Recognizing its potential as a bioenergy crop, some yield trials have been carried out around the world. In Malaysia, Halim et al. tested 9 different napier variants and found that regular napier grass yielded the most (65 dry tonnes per hectare per year), with the King Grass variant second (62 tonnes).The soil was fertilised, rainfall was 2700 mm. For yield results, see table 2, page 40: In Colombia, Cardona et al. estimates a yield range of 40–60 dry tonnes for the napier variant King Grass, under optimal conditions.See page 206: In drier areas however, yields decline; Gwayumba et al. estimate 15–40 dry tonnes as the general yield range for Kenya.See page 516: At the top end of the range, napier grasses have been shown to yield up to 80 dry tonnes per hectare per year,Zhang et al. measured a bana grass yield of 74 dry tonnes per hectare per year with light fertilisation and 1000 mm rainfall. See pages 96, 98: Hoshino et al. measured a yield of 75.6 dry tonnes per hectare per year the second year of growth under heavy fertilisation and with rainfall level 1000 mm annually. See pages 310, 311, 315: Vicente- Chandler et al. found that heavily fertilized napiergrass produced 75,661 pounds of dry matter per acre per year when cut at 90-day intervals, equivalent to 84.8 tonnes per hectare per year. See page 202: and commercial napier grass developers advertise yields of roughly 100 dry tonnes per hectare per year, provided there is an adequate amount of rain or irrigation available (100 mm per month).\\"The total water requirements are approximately 100 mm (4 inches) per month rainfall equivalent. [...] The yield of Giant King Grass depends on the time between harvests. For example, a six-month harvest of tall Giant King Grass, one can expect to obtain 80 or more US tons per acre (180 metric tons per hectare) of fresh grass at approximately 70-75% moisture. For two harvests per year, double these figures.\\" Mackay quotes yields of 360 wet tonnes per hectare per year, but does not quantify moisture content. These yields are high compared to other types of energy crops. For large-scale plantations with pines, acacias, poplars and willows in temperate regions, Smil estimates yields of 5–15 dry tonnes per hectare per year, and for similarly large plantations, with eucalyptus, acacia, leucaena, pinus and dalbergia in tropical and subtropical regions, his estimate is 20–25 dry tonnes. In Brazil, the average yield for eucalyptus is 21 t/ha, but in Africa, India and Southeast Asia, typical eucalyptus yields are below 10 t/ha. See pages 85-86: Push-pull pest management The push-pull pest management technique involves the desired crop being planted alongside a 'push' plant, which repels pests, in combination with a 'pull' crop around the perimeter of the plot, which draw insects out of the plot.[Khan, Z. R., Midega, C. A. O., Wadhams, L. J., Pickett, J. A., & Mumuni, A. (2007). Evaluation of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureun) varieties for use as trap plants for the management of African stemborer (Busseola fusca) in a push-pull strategy Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 124, 201-211.] Napier grass has shown potential at attracting stemborer moths (a main cause of yield loss in Africa) away from maize and hence is the \\"pull\\" crop. This strategy is much more sustainable, serves more purposes and is more affordable for farmers than insecticide use. Stemborers (Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus) are the cause of 10% of total yield loss in Southern and Eastern Africa and on average 14-15% in sub-Saharan Africa. The larvae cause immense damage to maize and sorghum by burrowing into their stems and eating from within. This not only makes them difficult to detect and remove but also damages the vascular tissue necessary for plant growth. Insecticide effectiveness is low against stemborers, as larvae are protected by protective cell wall layers around the stem. Insecticides are also expensive for poor farmers and can build chemical resistance by the pests.[Miller, J. R., & Cowles, R. S. (1990). Stimulo- deterrent diversion: A concept and its possible application to onion maggot control. Journal of Chemical Ecology, 16(11), 3197-3212.] In addition, chemicals are carried into final food products. Instead of trying to prevent the occurrence of pests, the push-pull strategy (also known as stimuli- deterrent) aims to guide their inevitable biological evolution to prevent damage to valued crops. The method proposes that sorghum or corn be intercropped with Desmodium (the \\"push\\" plant), which repels the moths as they look to lay their eggs. Desmodium also provides a ground cover and is nitrogen fixing, which improves soil fertility while decreasing labour involved with weeding. This deterrent is used in combination with Napier grass planted around the perimeter of the plot. A study of Kenyan farmers using the push- pull strategy reported an 89% reduction in Striga (a parasitic weed), an 83% increase in soil fertility, and 52% effectiveness in stemborer control.[Khan, Z. R., Amudavi, D. M., Midega, C. A. O., Wanyama, J. M., & Pickett, J. A.(2008). Farmers' perceptions of a 'push-pull' technology for control of cereal stemborers and striga weed in western Kenya. Crop Protection, 27, 976-987.] Considering that striga, stemborers, and low soil fertility together cause yield losses of an estimated 7 billion US dollars or enough to feed 27 million people, the implementation of this technique could significantly reduce food insecurity. Although promising as a sustainable and affordable option, the success of push-pull pest management highly depends on proper implementation in combination with other good ecological practices. Firstly, not all varieties of Napier grass function as a trap. In a study of eight varieties, only two bana and Ugandan hairless Napier varieties significantly attracted female moths for egg placement over maize. Of these two, only bana significantly decreased survival rates. In a farmer's field, it is recommended that three rows of bana Napier grass be planted as a border crop around the entire field. Potential exists to improve the push-pull strategy through further trials with different intercrops, by manipulating allelochemicals in each intercrop, as well as by investigating insect sensitivity to natural chemicals. Once prominent in a field, it is difficult to rid the area of the stemborer pests as larvae can remain dormant, and therefore push-pull management will not have the intended effect. It is recommended that if an infestation is particularly severe, neither corn, nor sorghum should be planted in the same field the following year but instead rotated with other crops. It is also important to burn infested stalks or, if they have an intended use, to leave them out in the sun for three days. The use of push- pull pest management must be used in combination with good ecological practices to yield the desired results. Finally, the establishment of a push- pull system requires increased labour in the primary stages and a large enough land plot to allow space for a non-food crop to be planted; these factors often deter its adoption. A program could increase adoption rates through promoting its use in combination with livestock, giving economic value to the planting of Napier. More information can be found at http://www.push-pull.net/ as well as specifics for implementation at http://www.push- pull.net/farmers_guide_2012.pdf . Other uses Use as fodder crop in Kenya Napier grass is the most important fodder crop for the dairy farmers in East Africa. Its high productivity makes it particularly suited to feed cattle and buffaloes. Hairless varieties, such as Ugandan hairless, have much higher value as fodder. As it is able to grow with little water and nutrients, grazing has made productive use of arid lands for food production. Furthermore, livestock can be incorporated into the pull-push management system providing another economically viable purpose for the ‘trap’ plant. Napier grass is valuable to African landscapes as it prevents soil erosion. It can also serve as a fire break, a wind break, and to improve soil fertility. More recently, Napier has been used to alleviate pressure on food production as there is 2Gha of non-arable land suitable for energy crop production. Thermal pyrolytic conversion is used to produce charcoal, biogas and bio-oil. Although this technology is not currently in use, it could be implemented as a means of providing energy to African communities, while enriching the soils of the local landscape. It is also used as source of fuel. The young leaves and shoots are edible and are cooked to make soups and stews.Heuzé V., Tran G., Giger-Reverdin S., Lebas F., 2016.

Rage, Tacuinum Sanitatis casanatensis (14th century). Angel with Temperance and Humility virtues versus Devil with Rage and Anger sins. A fresco from the 1717 Saint Nicolas church in Cukovets, Pernik Province, Bulgaria Rage (also known as frenzy or fury) is intense, uncontrolled anger that is an increased stage of hostile response to a perceived egregious injury or injustice.Cf. The APA definition of anger (\\"an emotion characterized by tension and hostility arising from frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice\\") and rage (\\"intense, typically uncontrolled anger. It is usually differentiated from hostility in that it is not necessarily accompanied by destructive actions but rather by excessive expressions\\"). Etymology Old French raige, rage (French: rage), from Medieval Latin rabia, from Latin rabies (\\"anger fury\\") akin to Sanskrit rabhas (violence). The Vulgar Latin spelling of the word possesses many cognates when translated into many of the modern Romance languages, such as Spanish, Galician, Catalan, Portuguese, and modern Italian: rabia, rabia, ràbia, raiva, and rabbia respectively. Symptoms and effects Rage can sometimes lead to a state of mind where the individuals experiencing it believe they can do, and often are capable of doing, things that may normally seem physically impossible. Those experiencing rage usually feel the effects of high adrenaline levels in the body. This increase in adrenal output raises the physical strength and endurance levels of the person and sharpens their senses, while dulling the sensation of pain. High levels of adrenaline impair memory. Temporal perspective is also affected: people in a rage have described experiencing events in slow-motion. Time dilation occurs due to the individual becoming hyper aware of the hind brain (the seat of fight or flight). Rational thought and reasoning would inhibit an individual from acting rapidly upon impulse. An older explanation of this \\"time dilation\\" effect is that instead of actually slowing our perception of time, high levels of adrenaline increase our ability to recall specific minutiae of an event after it occurs. Since humans gauge time based on the number of things they can remember, high- adrenaline events such as those experienced during periods of rage seem to unfold more slowly.Eagleman, et al., 2007 A person in a state of rage may also lose much of their capacity for rational thought and reasoning, and may act, usually violently, on their impulses to the point that they may attack until they themselves have been incapacitated or the source of their rage has been destroyed. A person in rage may also experience tunnel vision, muffled hearing, increased heart rate, and hyperventilation. Their vision may also become \\"rose-tinted\\" (hence \\"seeing red\\"). They often focus only on the source of their anger. The large amounts of adrenaline and oxygen in the bloodstream may cause a person's extremities to shake. Psychiatrists consider rage to be at one end of the spectrum of anger, and annoyance to be at the other side.DiGiuseppe & Tafrate., 2006. In 1995, rage was hypothesized to occur when oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone are rapidly released from the hypothalamus. This results in the pituitary gland producing and releasing large amounts of the adrenocorticotropic hormone, which causes the adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids. This chain reaction occurs when faced with a threatening situation.Jezova et al., 1995; Sapolsky, 1992. Nearly two decades later, more came to be known about the impacts of high epinephrine. As the focus in neuroscience began to shift towards the roles of white matter tissues, a more full bodied understanding of this complex emotion was able to be extrapolated. Memory, being the “retention of perceptions”, can be viewed as a giant mosaic.(Robertson, 2002) This mosaic would consist of fragmented perceptions (tiles) being held together by astrocytes (glue), creating resistance. A ratio of 3:2 could indicate an increased demand on neurons being held together, or insulated. This also raises the possibility that a more developed memory improved an individual’s fitness. In addition, an increase in white matter tissues assisted in an individual's ability to adapt to new cultures and environments. The metaphor of a kaleidoscope is often utilized when expressing the extraordinary ability humans have at adapting to different cultures by engaging in different patterns of thought. Our ability to perceive patterns of behavior assists in our ability to utilize inductive reasoning, a type of reasoning that can assist in an individual's ability to think of how their behaviors may impact their future. Such lines of reasoning are strengthened through the use of deductive reasoning. Together, inductive and deductive reasoning have assisted in developing adaptive conflict management strategies that assist in the cessation of rage caused by cognitive dissonance[citation needed]. Astrocytes play a pivotal role in regulating blood flow to and from neurons by creating the blood-brain barrier (BBB).(Lundgaard I et al., 2013) More specifically, these astrocytes are found in close proximity to the ‘end feet’ of blood vessels. These astrocytes aid in the tightening and expansion of the blood vessels to regulate which nutrients make their way to the neurons.(Frank 2013) The BBB protects the brain from toxins and helps transport things such as oxygen and glucose to the brain. This system plays a crucial role in the regulation of memory. Studies have suggested that glucose, together with epinephrine from the adrenal medulla have an effect on memory. Although high doses of epinephrine have been proven to impair memory, moderate doses of epinephrine actually enhance memory.(Gold, 2013) This leads to questioning the role that epinephrine has played on the evolution of the genus Homo as well as epinephrine's crucial role during fits of rage. The crucial role that astrocytes play in the formation of muscle memory may also shed light on the beneficial impact of meditation and deep breathing as a method of managing and controlling one's rage. Health complications Some research suggests that an individual is more susceptible to having feelings of depression and anxiety if he or she experiences rage on a frequent basis. Health complications become much worse if an individual represses feelings of rage.Begley, 1994. John E. Sarno believes that repressed rage in the subconscious leads to physical ailments. Cardiac stress and hypertension are other health complications that will occur when rage is experienced on a regular basis. Psychopathologies such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder regularly present comorbidly with rage.Painuly et al., 2005 Treatment =Types of therapy= Evidence has shown that behavioral and cognitive therapy techniques have assisted individuals that have difficulties controlling their anger or rage. Role playing and personal study are the two main techniques used to aid individuals with managing rage. Role playing is utilized by angering an individual to the point of rage and then showing them how to control it.Willner et al., 2002; Lishman et al., 2008. Multi-modal cognitive therapy is another treatment used to help individuals cope with anger. This therapy teaches individuals relaxation techniques, problem solving skills, and techniques on response disruption. This type of therapy has proven to be effective for individuals that are highly stressed and are prone to rage.Gerzina & Drummond, 2000. An emerging business is the rage room, a place where people relieve their stress by destroying objects within a room.business where people can vent their anger by destroying objects within a room Psychology According to psychologists, rage is an in-born behavior that every person exhibits in some form. Rage is often used to denote hostile/affective/reactive aggression.Fontaine, 2007 Rage tends to be expressed when a person faces a threat to their pride, position, ability to deceive others, self-deceptive beliefs, or socioeconomic status.Anderson, 2001. This maladaptive conflict management strategy often stems from cognitive dissonance, most simply put, a 'no' where a 'yes' has been. Cases in which rage is exhibited as a direct response to an individual's deeply held religious beliefs, may directly be related to cognitive dissonance in relation to an individual's ability to manage the terror associated with death and dying. Many researchers have questioned whether Hindu/Buddhist concepts, such as reincarnation and nibbâna, help ease death anxieties. Coleman and Ka-Ying Hui (2012) stated that “according to the Terror Management Theory, a religious concept of an afterlife helps people manage their personal death anxiety” (949). This suggests that rage, in relation to religious ideas, may stem from an inability to manage feelings of terror. Some psychologists, however, such as Bushman and Anderson, argue that the hostile/predatory dichotomy that is commonly employed in psychology fails to define rage fully, since it is possible for anger to motivate aggression, provoking vengeful behavior, without incorporating the impulsive thinking that is characteristic of rage. They point to individuals or groups such as Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech massacre or Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of the Columbine High School massacre, all of whom clearly experienced intense anger and hate, but whose planning (sometimes over periods of years), forethought, and lack of impulsive behavior is readily observable.DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2006.

Founded in 1995 and owned by photographer and journalist Ivo Pukanić, Nacional quickly gained a reputation for reporting and critical articles about the conservative government led by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which was in power during the 1990s. During most of its existence its main rival was Globus published by Europapress Holding (EPH). History Nacional was launched in 1995 by Denis Kuljiš, Ivo Pukanić and other prominent journalists dissatisfied with the editorial policies of then popular weekly Globus. Soon a bitter competition developed between two magazines, because they tried to grab the same readership and used the same techniques of investigative journalism. In 2000 Pukanić stepped down as editor-in-chief to oversee the launch of his short-lived daily Republika, which was meant to compete with EPH's Jutarnji list. Republika was launched in late 2000, only to fold in May 2001 due to low circulation. After 2000 Nacional's editorial policy shifted to include more business and entertainment content. Following the failure of Republika Pukanić returned to the magazine as an investigative reporter. Shortly after the 2008 assassination of Ivo Pukanić, the magazine's sales plummeted, and in 2010 it was bought by a Swiss media company owned by Harald von Seefried. Soon after the acquisition a group of journalists dissatisfied by the new owner's editorial policies left Nacional to found a rival weekly called Aktual, whose first issue was published in June 2011.

UNESCO reports, IRAQ, EDUCATION IN TRANSITION NEEDS AND CHALLENGES 2004. had one of the best educational performances in the region. Primary school Gross Enrollment Rate was 100% and literacy levels were high. Since that time education has suffered as a result of American-led domination, sanctions, and instability. History under Saddam Saddam Hussein Promoting women's literacy and education in the 1970s Iraq established its education system in 1921, offering both public and private paths. In the early 1970s, education became public and free at all levels, and mandatory at the primary level. Two ministries manage the education system in Iraq: the Ministry of Education [MOE] and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research [MOHSR]. The Ministry of Educatiocientific Research [MOHSR] is in charge of tertiary education and research centers. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the 1973 energy crisis, and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda. Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the \\"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\\" and the campaign for \\"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,\\" and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).Saddam Hussein, CBC News, 29 December 2006Jessica Moore, The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power, PBS Online Newshour  Current structure, status, and scale of education in Iraq  An Iraqi boy at a primary school in the Bayaa District of Baghdad It is generally agreed upon that before 1990, this Educational system in Iraq was one of the best in the region in addressing both access and equality. However, the situation began to deteriorate rapidly due to several wars and economic sanctions. According to UNESCO’s 2003 Situation Analysis of education in Iraq, the educational system in the Centre/South worsened despite the provision of basics through the Oil for Food Programme.UNESCO. Situation Analysis of Education in Iraq. Paris: 2003, p.56 Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) did not suffer as much due to rehabilitation and reconstruction programs organized through several UN agencies. Since then, major problems have emerged that are hindering the system and include: lack of resources, the politicization of the educational system, uneven emigration and internal displacement of teachers and students, security threats, and corruption. Illiteracy is widespread in comparison with before, standing at 39% for the rural population. Almost 22% of the adult population in Iraq has never attended school, and a mere 9% have secondary school as highest level completed. As far as gender equity, 47% of women in Iraq are either fully or partly illiterate, as women’s education suffers from differences across regions, and especially between the North and South. Since the 2003 invasion and the fall of the former regime [Saddam Hussein], Iraqis with the help of international agencies and foreign governments, have been attempting to create frameworks that would begin to address the issues at hand. According to the National Development Strategy of Iraq,Republic of Iraq. Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation. National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007 published on June 30, 2005, the new vision for Iraq intends to: “Transform Iraq into a peaceful, unified federal democracy and a prosperous, market- oriented regional economic powerhouse that is fully integrated into the global economy” .Republic of Iraq. Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation. National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p. viii This stems from the fact that the country’s economy has been mismanaged for 40 years, and a country that once held a bright private sector and the educated population has come to have one of the lowest human development indicators in the region. The National Development Strategy [NDS] contains four major areas of concentration: * Strengthening the foundations of economic growth * Revitalizing the private sector * Improving quality of life * Strengthening good governance and security The major pillar above that includes the category of education is that of “Improving quality of life”, as ‘healthy citizens tend to be productive citizens that will be able to take advantage of the opportunities provided in a market-oriented economy’ .Republic of Iraq. Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation. National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p.xi The exact strategy towards education includes ‘investing in human capital with a focus on adult literacy, vocational training, and actions to reduce drop-out rates at the primary level’ .Republic of Iraq. Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation. National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p. xii Education after the 2003 invasion thumb Iraqi medical students at Basra University College of Medicine (2010) Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority, with substantial international assistance, undertook a complete reform of Iraq’s education system. Among immediate goals were the removal of previously pervasive Baathist ideology from curricula and substantial increases in teacher salaries and training programs, which the Hussein government was unable to provide in the 1990s. The new Ministry of Education appointed a national curriculum commission to revise curricula in all subject areas. Because of under-funding by the Hussein regime, in 2003 an estimated 80 percent of Iraq’s 15,000 school buildings needed rehabilitation and lacked basic sanitary facilities, and most schools lacked libraries and laboratories. In the 1990s, school attendance decreased drastically as education funding was cut and economic conditions forced children into the workforce. After the regime change, the system included about 6 million students in kindergarten through twelfth grade and 300,000 teachers and administrators. Education is mandatory only through the sixth grade, after which a national examination determines the possibility of continuing into the upper grades. Although a vocational track is available to those who do not pass the exam, few students elect that option because of its poor quality. Boys and girls generally attend separate schools beginning with seventh grade. In 2005 obstacles to further reform were poor security conditions in many areas, a centralized system that lacked accountability for teachers and administrators, and the isolation in which the system functioned for the previous 30 years. Few private schools exist. (One notable example: The Classical School of the Medes in Northern Iraq.) Prior to the occupation of 2003, some 240,000 persons were enrolled in institutions of higher education. The CIA World Factbook estimates that in 2000 the adult literacy rate was 84 percent for males and 64 percent for females, with UN figures suggesting a small fall in literacy of Iraqis aged 15–24 between 2000 and 2008, from 84.8% to 82.4%. Education under the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraqi Kurdistan in northern Iraq faces many problems. There is a large number of people who have \\"fake and bogus awards like MAs, PhDs and professorial titles\\". Loyal political party members with fake university titles hold \\"high official ranks from ministries to university chancellors, deans of colleges, general managers, administrators, supervisors and school headmasters\\". Critics state that education in Iraqi Kurdistan is \\"overshadowed by political rivalry, media propaganda, fake patriotism, nationalist sentiments and party affiliation\\". http://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/kurdinstan- education-sector-is-riddled-with-corruption-80326/  Education under the Baathist regime before the 1990s  The impact of government policies on the class structure and stratification patterns can be imputed from available statistics on education and training as well as employment and wage structures. Owing to the historic emphasis on the expansion of educational facilities, the leaders of the Baath Party and indeed much of Iraq's urban middle class were able to move from rural or urban lower-class origins to middle and even top positions in the state apparatus, the public sector, and the society at large. This social history is confirmed in the efforts of the government to generalize opportunities for basic education throughout the country. Between 1976 and 1986, the number of primary-school students increased 30 percent; female students increased 45 percent, from 35 to 44 percent of the total. The number of primary-school teachers increased 40 percent over this period. At the secondary level, the number of students increased by 46 percent, and the number of female students increased by 55 percent, from 29 to 36 percent of the total. Baghdad, which had about 29 percent of the population, had 26 percent of the primary students, 27 percent of the female primary students, and 32 percent of the secondary students. Education was provided by the government through a centrally organized school system. In the early 1980s, the system included a six-year primary (or elementary) level known as the first level. The second level, also of six years, consisted of an intermediate-secondary and an intermediate-preparatory, each of three years. Graduates of these schools could enroll in a vocational school, one of the teacher training schools or institutes, or one of the various colleges, universities, or technical institutes. The number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools was highest in the central region and lowest in the north, although the enrollment of the northern schools was only slightly lower than that of the south. Before the war, the government had made considerable gains in lessening the extreme concentration of primary and secondary educational facilities in the main cities, notably Baghdad. Vocational education, which had been notoriously inadequate in Iraq, received considerable official attention in the 1980s. The number of students in technical fields had increased threefold since 1977, to over 120,090 in 1986. The Baath regime also seemed to have made progress since the late 1960s in reducing regional disparities, although they were far from eliminated and no doubt was more severe than statistics would suggest. Baghdad, for example, was the home of most educational facilities above the secondary level, since it was the site not only of Baghdad University, which in the academic year 1983–84 (the most recent year for which statistics were available in early 1988) had 34,555 students, but also of the Foundation of Technical Institutes with 34,277 students, Mustansiriya University with 11,686 students, and the University of Technology with 7,384 students. The universities in Basra, Mosul, and Erbil, taken together, enrolled 26 percent of all students in higher education in the academic year 1983–84. The number of students seeking to pursue higher education in the 1980s increased dramatically. Accordingly, in the mid-1980s the government made plans to expand Salahaddin University in Erbil in the north and to establish Ar-Rashid University outside Baghdad. The latter was not yet in existence in early 1988 but both were designed ultimately to accommodate 50,000 students. In addition, at the end of December 1987, the government announced plans to create four more universities: one in Tikrit in the central area, one each at Al Kufah and Al Qadisiyah in the south, and one at Al Anbar in the west. Details of these universities were not known. With the outbreak of the war, the government faced a difficult dilemma regarding education. Despite the shortage of wartime manpower, the regime was unwilling to tap the pool of available university students, arguing that these young people were Iraq's hope for the future. As of early 1988, therefore, the government routinely exempted students from military service until graduation, a policy it adhered to rigorously.  Challenges & problems per the current conditions of education in Iraq  There is currently an insufficient supply of schools, and most schools suffer from poor conditions. * Gap of 3590 schools in 2003 result in double or triple shifts in school buildings * About 70% of schools lack clean water and latrines * Almost 1000 schools are built from mud, straw, or tents * Poor quality of inputs includes: science labs, libraries, equipment, an outdated curriculum, lack of teacher training and food sources, and staff absenteeism * Centralized Administration * Insufficient jobs for university graduates, and falling academic standards in many universities Since 2003 and the fall of the dictatorial regime, the war on Saddam Hussein and sectarian conflict has further destabilized the education system in Iraq. * 2751 schools were damaged severely and require rehabilitation. 2400 schools experienced looting. * Schools in dangerous areas were forced to close for extended periods * Education personals were targeted, kidnapped, attacked, and or killed * Teacher absenteeism and that of girls reached a high level, due to the security threat *Bombings in Baghdad claim lives of 16 students. Since the bombing at Samar’a in 2006, displacement of both teachers and students has been another factor in the destabilization of the system. * ~320,000 students are displaced [200,000 internally] * ~65% of the displaced are males. Girls tend to drop out. * ~20,000 teachers are displaced * Internal migration patterns vary, which places a burden on the system as it cannot deal with changing demands * External displacement is located mostly in Jordan (where the students are absorbed into the system, with fees paid by the MOE in Iraq), Syria (where the students continue forward with the Iraqi education system and testing), and Egypt  Current resources devoted to education in Iraq  One Laptop per Child in Najmi, Al Muthanna Governorate Since May 2003, international agencies have been involved in supporting education in Iraq, but fragmented data has not allowed these numbers to be integrated into the governmental budget. The UN [~US$80 million] and World BankWorld Bank External Website, Iraq, Project Status Sheets have two trust funds that go to help Iraq specifically, while USAID has contracts through the US Supplemental Budget for Iraq. Although these programs are a great beginning, they do not reach the level as assessed by the October 2003 UN/WB Needs Assessment Study, $4.8 billion. Current Projects financed by the Iraq Trust Fund, include but are not limited to: * Emergency Textbook Provision Project: [US$40million]. Since May 2004, the project is intended to finance and distribute 69 million textbooks for 6 million students spread across all of the governorates for the 2004/05 year. * Emergency School Construction Rehabilitation Project: [US$60million]. Since October 2004, the project is meant to construct 55 school buildings and rehabilitate 133 schools. The rehabilitation of 133 schools is complete, at an average cost of US$181 per student, and benefits 45,000 pupils while creating 3,000 construction jobs. * Emergency School Construction Rehabilitation Project- Supplemental Grant for Marshland Schools: [US$6million]. Since October 2006, the grant provides additional funding for the Emergency School Construction and Rehabilitation Project to construct ~33 new schools in the Marshland areas of Iraq. This would go to benefit between 6,000 and 8,000 children in that region, and create near-term employment opportunities within construction. Local stakeholders are involved (i.e. NGOs). * Third Emergency Education Project [US$100million]: The funds are from the International Development Agency [IDA], in collaboration with the World Bank.

A heiau () is a Hawaiian temple. Made in different architectural styles depending upon their purpose and location, they range from simple earth terraces, to elaborately constructed stone platforms. There are heiau to treat the sick (heiau hōola), offer first fruits, offer first catch, start rain, stop rain, increase the population, ensure the health of the nation, achieve success in distant voyaging, reach peace, and achieve success in war (luakini). Only the luakini was dedicated through human sacrifice.Kamakau, Samuel. The Works of the People of Old, pp. 129-134 There are two types of luakini. They were called the ohia ko and hakuohia.Samuel Kamakau, Ka Poe Kahiko; The People of Old (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1993), 130. After the official end of Hawaiian religion in 1819 and with later pressure from Christian missionaries (who first arrived in 1820), many were deliberately destroyed, while others were allowed to fall into disrepair. Heiau are still considered sacred by many of the inhabitants of Hawaii, and some are not open to the public. In ancient times, only chiefs and priests were allowed into some of these heiau. There are even stories from Hawaiian folklore attributing the creation of these temples to the menehunes, a group of legendary dwarf people. Some heiau structures have been fully restored physically and are operated in the 21st century as public attractions. Architecture Heiau were made in different shapes depending upon their purpose, varying from simple stone markers to large stone platforms, which were both parts of human sacrificial temples.\\"Pu'ukohala Heiau: History & Culture\\", Natural Park Service, 15 August 2012. Retrieved on 13 November 2012. Their shapes could be rectangular, square, or rounded.Kamakau, p. 135 Some consisted of simple earth terraces, while others were elaborately constructed stone platforms. They could be placed on hills, cliffs, level earth, valleys and on the coastline touching the sea. Some koa or fishing shrines were built underwater. Heiau of the people varied in size. Large heiau were built by prominent people while small heiau were built by the humble.Samuel Kamakau, Ka Poe Kahiko; The People of Old (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1993), 131. US missionary Hiram Bingham described a heiau he saw on route hiking between the summits of Mauna Kea and Hualalai. Made of piled lava rock, it was a square of , with walls eight feet high and four feet thick (2.5 by 1.3m). A doorway led through the middle of the north wall. Eight pyramids surrounded the outside of the temple. Made also of piled lava rock, they were in diameter and 12 to high.Bingham, Hiram. A Residence 21 Years in the Sandwich Islands, Tuttle (1981) p. 397 Heiau types The luakini pookanaka were large heiaus. Only the Alii nui of an island or moku could use this type of heiau. Other chiefs or the makaainana that built this type of heiau were considered rebels. This type of heiau was usually built alongside coastlines, in the interior of the land, or on mountain sides. The largest heiau on Oahu is Puu O Mahuka, which covers almost two acres of land.Pu'u O Mahuka Heiau State Historic Site, Department of Land and Natural Resources, N.d. Retrieved on 13 November 2012. Preserved sites The heiau most commonly preserved are war temples of the later period of history (e.g. Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site). They are composed of large stone platforms with various structures built upon them. The structures were used to house priests, sacred ceremonial drums, sacred items, and cult images representing the gods associated with that particular temple. There were also altars (Ahu) on which to offer sacrifices (plant, animal and human). The heiau were sacred places; only the kahuna (priests) and certain sacred ali'i (high chiefs) were allowed to enter. The largest heiau known to exist, Hale O Pi'ilani Heiau, is a massive, three-acre (12,000-square-meter) platform with fifty-foot retaining walls, located in Hāna on Maui. Built for Pi'ilani, it dates to the 13th century. Agricultural heiau, called generally Hale-o-Lono for the god of fertility, can be found today on Oahu at Makaha (Kaneaki heiau - fully restored) and in Hawaii Kai (Pahua heiau - partially restored). The Kaneaki heiau was built in the 17th century, containing grass and thatched huts that were chambers used for prayer and meditation.Kaneaki Heiau Oahu, Hawaii Web, N.d. Retrieved on 13 November 2012. The ruins of a healing heiau, Keaiwa (\\"the mysterious\\"), are located at the entrance to Keaiwa State Park in Aiea. Puuhonua o Honaunau, in South Kona on the island of Hawaii, is a place of refuge. It incorporates a heiau complex within it. Because the land of heiau was sacred, it was not unusual for successive generations to add to original structures and the heiau purpose could change over time. An example is Ulupo heiau in Kailua on Oahu, which is said to have been built by the menehune, that is, a long time ago. It is thought to have been used first as an agricultural heiau and later as a luakini. Destruction The kapu or 'ai kapu system was abolished in October 1819 by Kamehameha II (Liholiho). The abolition of the kapu system ended the use of heiau as places of worship and sacrifice. A period referred to as the 'Ai Noa or \\"free eating\\" followed. Missionaries arrived in 1820, and most of the aliʻi converted to Christianity, including Kaʻahumanu and Keōpūolani. It took 11 years for Kaʻahumanu to proclaim laws against ancient religious practices. All heiau were officially abandoned; most were destroyed over the years. Often they were broken up and plowed under to make way for fields of sugar cane. However, some of the families who were responsible for the heiau have continued the tradition of caring for them.

Nistor, Die moldauischen Ansprüche auf Pokutien, Vienna 1910 Pokuttya or Pokuttia (, , , ) is an historical area of East-Central Europe, situated between the Dniester and Cheremosh rivers and Carpathian Mountains, in southwestern part of modern Ukraine. Historically it was a culturally distinct area inhabited by Ukrainians and Romanians on the previously unpopulated borders between Lviv and Halych. Although the historical centre of the area was Kolomyia, the name itself is derived from the town of Kuty that literally means 'round the corner' (\\"Kut\\" by itself means \\"corner\\"). The region is now inhabited mainly by Ukrainians. History Having been a part of Kyivan Rus and then one of its successor states, Halych-Volhynia in the early medieval period, the area was conquered by the Kingdom of Poland in 1325, and later annexed in 1349 by Casimir III of Poland. Władysław II Jagiełło, needing financial support for his battles against the Teutonic Knights, used the region as a guarantee for a loan which he obtained from Petru II of Moldavia, who himself gained control of the region in 1388. Petru was eager to gain influence in the internal politics of the Kingdom of Poland, supporting the cause of his long-time allies, the Jagiellons of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Pokuttia, thus, became the feudal property of the princes of Moldavia, but remained within the Kingdom of Poland. As in other such famous 'deals' in medieval Europe (e.g. Foix, or the Dauphiné), when the local feudal lord had to swear an oath of allegiance to the king for the specific territory, even when the former was himself an independent ruler of another state. Consequently, the region became a matter for judicial and military dispute between the two countries, because the debt was never repaid in full by Poland. Principality of Moldavia during the reign of Stephen the Great In 1485, Moldavian prince Stephen the Great, having lost his country's access to the Black Sea the previous year to the Ottomans, was in serious need of alliances, and swore allegiance to Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland for Pokuttia, in what is known as the Colomeea oath.In local folklore it is held that Casimir ordered the tent where the oath was taking place to be suddenly uncovered, so as to show Stephen on his knees in front of his nobles and escort. It is said that Stephen, renowned for his religious piety, quickly turned towards an icon and crossed himself, in order not to appear shamed in front of his men. However, Casimir's successor, John I Albert of Poland, used the treaty as a pretext to invade Moldavia itself in 1497. Even after four months of siege, he failed to take the fortress of Suceava, Stephen's capital, and abandoning the siege, his army ran into a trap that caused many of his nobles to die. See Battle of the Cosmin Forest. In 1498, Pokuttia was conquered by Stephen the Great, annexed and retained by Moldavia until the Battle of Obertyn in 1531, when it was recaptured by Poland's hetman Jan Tarnowski, who defeated Stephen's son Petru Rareş. Minor Polish-Moldavian clashes for Pokuttia continued for the next 15 years, until Petru Rareş's death. Throughout Middle Ages, Obertyn was Pokuttia's main castle, while Kolomyia was the region's main market town and fair. Following the Partitions of Poland of 1772, Pokuttya fell under the Habsburg Monarchy. Modern times In the wake of the World War I and the fall of Austria-Hungary, it became disputed between Poland and the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic, which had its seat of government in Stanyslawiw after it failed to hold Lwow. In May 1919, Polish and Romanian forces occupied Pokuttya in order to create a corridor between Poland and Romania. In August 1919, the Romanian Army handed eastern Pokuttya over to Poland.Philippe Henri Blasen: Pocuce, injuste prius detractum, recepit... Rumänische Ansprüche auf die südostgalizische Gegend Pokutien ? In: Analele Bucovinei, 1/2014 After the Polish-Soviet War, it remained in Poland. As a result of the 1939 invasion and partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the area was initially attached to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, falling to Nazi control after the start of Operation Barbarossa until 1944. It was then incorporated into the Soviet controlled Western Ukrainian oblast of Ivano-Frankivsk, roughly corresponding to the southern half of the oblast. Pokuttya's population still contains today some Romanian and Ukrainian Hutsul communities. At the 2001 census there were 600 Romanians and Moldovans recorded.

It is widespread across most of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada.Biota of North America Program 2013 county distribution map Mayapples are woodland plants, typically growing in colonies derived from a single root. The stems grow to 30–40 cm tall, with palmately lobed umbrella-like leaves up to 20–40 cm diameter with 3–9 shallowly to deeply cut lobes. The plants produce several stems from a creeping underground rhizome; some stems bear a single leaf and do not produce any flower or fruit, while flowering stems produce a pair or more leaves with 1–8 flowers in the axil between the apical leaves. The flowers are white, yellow or red, 2–6 cm diameter with 6–9 petals, and mature into a green, yellow or red fleshy fruit 2–5 cm long. All the parts of the plant are poisonous, including the green fruit, but once the fruit has turned yellow, it can be safely eaten in small amounts with the seeds removed.http://www.eattheweeds.com/podophyllum-peltatum-forgotten-fruit-2/ The ripe fruit does not produce toxicity. The substance they contain (podophyllotoxin or podophyllin) is used as a purgative and as a cytostatic. Posalfilin is a drug containing podophyllin and salicylic acid that is used to treat the plantar wart. They are also grown as ornamental plants for their attractive foliage and flowers, and they are a larval host for the golden borer moth and the may apple borer.

The fruit or \\"apple\\" is usually produced early in summer and ripens later in summer. Many species of plants have mycorrhizae to assist with nutrient uptake in infertile conditions. Mayapple plants are considered obligately dependent upon such mycorrhizae, although it may also be facultatively dependent upon rhizome age and soil nutrient levels.Watson, M.A. and five others. 2001.

The Directorates were titled Children, Young People and Social Care; Schools; and Lifelong Learning. They were responsible for education in Scotland; social work care for children and young people and lifelong learning. In December 2010 these functions were taken on by the Learning and Justice Directorates. The Directorates reported to the Director-General Leslie Evans. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning is Mike Russell.Scotland.gov.uk- Ministers and he was then supported by the Minister for Children and Early Years, Adam Ingram MSP and by the Minister for Skills and Lifelong Learning, Angela Constance MSP at that time. History The Scottish Education Department (SED) came into being as the body responsible for schooling in Scotland when it was formed from the Church of Scotland's Board of Education for Scotland in 1872. The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 made education compulsory and took over the running of schools from the Church of Scotland. Burgh as well as parish schools now came under School Boards run by local committees. It was originally called the Scotch Education Department (see Scotch), was a committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and had its offices in London. In 1885 the department became a responsibility of the new ministerial post of Secretary for Scotland, under whom the Scottish Office was set up in Dover House, Whitehall, London. In 1918 the department was moved to Edinburgh and the name was changed to the Scottish Education Department, in accordance with Scottish usage. The Secretary for Scotland became the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1926. The department was renamed the Scottish Office Education Department (SOED) in 1991, and the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department (SOEID) in 1995. With devolution in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) to oversee school education whilst the Scottish Executive Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department – now Enterprise Transport and Lifelong Learning Department (ETLLD) – took over responsibility from the former SED for further and higher education and also maintenance grants for Scottish university students through the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, an Executive Agency of ETLLD.

As St. Louis’ largest independent craft brewery, Schlafly Beer brews more than 60 unique styles of beer. There are two brewpubs in which Schlafly Beer operates, the Schlafly Tap Room located in Downtown St. Louis, Missouri and Schlafly Bottleworks located in Maplewood, Missouri. History Lawyer and co-founder, Tom Schlafly casually proposed the idea to bring traditional styles to the states to a good friend of his Charles Kopman, a lawyer as well. Kopman then introduced Schlafly to his son, Dan, who had worked at a British brewery and had extensive knowledge in the field. Dan was privy to the idea of starting a microbrewery but Schlafly was concerned as Anheuser-Busch had the beer market cornered. On August 22, 1989, Schlafly began the incorporation process. Due to Missouri’s legal restrictions, Schlafly opened its first brewpub, a small brewery with an adjoining restaurant that would only sell its beer on premises. On December 26, 1991, the Schlafly Tap Room opened its doors to the public. A few weeks later, The Saint Louis Brewery completely ran out of beer. With Kopman and Schlafly’s plan to open a brewpub came struggles with Missouri law. Following Prohibition, Missouri lawmakers had introduced a three-tier system to prevent perceived dangers of breweries owning and controlling taverns, which would in turn decrease competition. This law made it illegal for any brewery to hold a retail liquor license, making it impossible to distribute beyond brewery- restaurants. In the fall of 1992, Schlafly began meeting with various lawmakers and drafted an amendment to the Missouri Microbrewery law. By January of 1993, the amendment was heard in court along with a bill to sell beer on Sundays in grocery and convenience stores. After negotiations with senators and meetings with Anheuser-Busch, the amendment seemed to be coming to fruition. In May 1993, the amendment had been rewritten “behind closed doors” decreasing the maximum barrel production from 17,500 barrels to 10,000. However, Kopman and Schlafly continued on and began selling their beer in St. Louis area establishments. The increase in local consumers led to a demand for bottled beer, but the barrel capacity limited production quantities. In 1996, Schlafly hired a contract brewery in Minnesota to brew and bottle for Schlafly styles and in June, bottles had hit the St. Louis market. In 1997, Schlafly again wanted to amend the law but found that a new liquor license would change the way Schlafly distributed and sold beer. Later that year, Schlafly was first sold in Busch Stadium and found its way into several other fine establishments in the St. Louis area. =The Schlafly Tap Room= In 1989, Schlafly and Kopman began brainstorming locations for The Saint Louis Brewery. After careful consideration, the pair landed on Locust Street. They decided to buy a historic building previously owned by John S. Swift, home of Swift Printing Company. The building was authentically built and had even appeared on the National Register of Historic Places, but had suffered fire damage in 1976. Schlafly renovated it and opened its doors on December 26, 1991. =Schlafly Bottleworks= In 2001, Schlafly decided it was time to expand to a bigger brewery which would expand brewing capacity. Looking to refurbish an abandoned supermarket, Kopman and Schlafly chose an empty supermarket in Maplewood, Missouri. On April 7, 2003, Schlafly Bottleworks opened its doors to the public for tours, dinner and beers at the bar. Schlafly Pale Ale, IPA and Summer Lager are all staples of The Saint Louis Brewery.

After being rescued from a POW camp, he returns home only to find his wife missing. Duffy Collins (Bruce Baron) is a gangster who falls for and is rejected by Jack Kaplan's wife Diane, after which he kidnaps and eventually kills her. Diane (Ann Milhench), is Jack Kaplan's wife who becomes the target of the amorous advances of Duffy Collins. Collins kidnaps her because she denies him. Diane is killed by Collins in a moment of rage after trying to escape. Eve (Gwendolyn Hung) is a treacherous, bleached-blonde femme fatale working for Duffy Collins, who works as a dancer in a nightclub. She tries to seduce Jack Kaplan, fails and is accidentally killed by Man with the Golden Hand. Digger (James Gaines) is a small-time crook and informer, who leads Jack Kaplan towards Duffy Collins and is killed for that by the Man with the Golden Hand. Man with the Golden Hand (Ruel Vernal) is a tracksuit-wearing hitman with a \\"golden hand\\", working for Duffy Collins. He kills Digger and Eve, after which he is disposed of by Jack Kaplan.

Plot  Jack Kaplan is a US Army Soldier and Weapons Expert kept as a POW somewhere in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos (the script is never quite clear on that). Liberated by a \\"rescue team\\", he returns home to the United States only to find out that his wife Diane has been captured by infatuated gangster Duffy Collins. Kaplan embarks on a mission to find his wife, running into characters like Digger, Man With The Golden Hand, and the treacherous femme fatale Eve. Diane is killed by Collins while trying to escape him, and the storyline turns extremely confusing. Collins sends bizarrely named hitmen like Cat Burglar and Panther out to kill Jack Kaplan, who dispatches all of them. Kaplan ends up suspected of the murder of one of the minor baddies (whom he didn't actually kill) and a fugitive from the law. Mike Monty and Ronnie Patterson show up as policemen, who eventually track Kaplan down to a junkyard where he's been hiding. Kaplan escapes with the help of his customized car and a combination of a bazooka, a crossbow and a shotgun. The setting switches from the US to \\"the jungle\\". Kaplan kills a legion of policemen on his trail and is wounded in the process. He holes up in a \\"jungle\\" cave, where he's attacked by a ninja called Shadow, who is one of the henchmen of Duffy Collins.

All, except Pigello, are accompanied by their patron saints: Saint Thomas (with the spear), Saint Anthony (with the bell), Mary Magdalen (with the pot of ointment) and Saint Margaret (with the book and the dragon). Description The central panel In the central panel, three shepherds fall to their knees before the child Jesus. Van der Goes painted these rustic characters very realistically. Kneeling angels surround the Virgin and the Child, who is not in a crib but lies on the ground surrounded by an aureole of golden rays. This unusual representation of the adoration of Jesus is probably based on one of the visions of Saint Bridget of Sweden. In the background, van der Goes painted scenes related to the main subject: on the left panel, Joseph and Mary on the road to Bethlehem; on the central panel (to the right), the shepherds visited by the angel; on the right panel, the Three Magi on the road to Bethlehem. When the work arrived in Florence in 1483, it was installed in the Portinari family chapel where it was deeply admired by the Italian artists who saw it, many of whom sought to emulate it. A good example is the Adoration of the Shepherds (1485) which Domenico Ghirlandaio painted in the Sassetti Chapel in the church of Santa Trinita in Florence. However, the naturalistic depiction of the shepherds is already present in Andrea Mantegna's Adoration of the Shepherds (Metropolitan Museum, New York), which dates from around 1450.

Founded in 1878 as a campground along the Ligonier Valley Railroad by Thomas Mellon, Idlewild is the oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania and the third oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind Lake Compounce and Cedar Point. The park has won several awards, including from industry publication Amusement Today as the best children's park in the world. The park was established by the prominent Mellon family in 1878, and remained family- owned for over 100 years. It expanded greatly throughout the first half of the 20th century, adding rides including a Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster in 1938, one of the company's earliest. The park is home to the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish athletic and cultural festival that has annually drawn over 10,000 spectators. In 1983, the park was purchased by Kennywood Entertainment Company, which oversaw additional expansion, including an attraction designed and voiced by Fred Rogers based on his television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Since 2008, the park, as well as others formerly under Kennywood Entertainment, have been owned by Spanish company Parques Reunidos and operated by their American subsidiary Palace Entertainment.  History  = Ligonier Valley Railroad: 1878–1952 = On April 15, 1853, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted a charter for a railroad to haul coal and timber between the towns of Ligonier and Latrobe. For nearly twenty years, Latrobe and Ligonier Rail Road Company performed no work on the railroad, and renewed their charter in 1866 and 1869. Following an additional renewal in 1871, the company changed its name to the Ligonier Valley Railroad and acquired a stretch of land. Land grading and bridge construction for the narrow gauge line was mostly completed by 1873.Croushore, p. 7. In 1875, the partially constructed railway was sold at a sheriff's sale after the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Latrobe terminus of the line, declined to assume financial responsibility. Thomas Mellon, a retired Court of Common Pleas judge from Allegheny County, purchased the Ligonier Valley Railroad at auction. Mellon had founded the T. Mellon and Sons Bank, and was invested in coal, steel, oil, glassmaking, and other railroad ventures. In an effort to attract passengers, Mellon decided to offer recreational grounds along the route. On May 1, 1878, William Darlington, landowner and namesake of the nearby village of Darlington, responded to Mellon's request to use his land: The first structure, built that year, was a train depot measuring by . The depot was described as the smallest full-service station in the United States.Futrell, p. 52. Initial development of the land included camp sites, an artificial lake for fishing and boating, picnic tables, and a large hall. The railroad provided easy access to the site, attracting visitors from away in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas for a getaway in the country. The Ligonier Echo noted that on July 4, 1890, the trains to the park were so crowded that the \\"tops of the coaches were covered with boys.\\"Futrell, p. 54. While the initial lease with Darlington confined the park to between the railroad and the north bank of the Loyalhanna Creek, permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to the south in the mid-1880s.Croushore, p. 18. Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam carousel in the center of the park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a bicycle track around Lake Bouquet, a hiking trail on the lake's island, fishing in the Loyalhanna Creek, rowboating, and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities. A sign acknowledging the Skooters' 1931 construction. Several signs similar to this can be found all over the park, put up for the park's 125th anniversary in 2002. In 1931, Judge Mellon's son Richard B. Mellon, brother of Andrew Mellon, and C. C. Macdonald acquired the park under a partnership known as the Idlewild Management Company. The first season under the financial support of Mellon and the management of Macdonald and his family brought electricity to the park, allowing for later operating hours and electric-powered rides, including a three-row Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel. The park also debuted a den of black bears that year. The bears were across the path from a cage of monkeys, who escaped in 1932. Park management offered a reward of $3 each ($ each in ) for the return of the seven monkeys, believing that they had been set loose. R. Z. Macdonald later said that his father, C. C., was always amused and pleased with the publicity that the escape created, though he never formally accused his father.Croushore, p. 37. The Macdonalds sought to maintain the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000 shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.Croushore, p. 25. = Macdonald family: 1952–1983 = The Macdonald family obtained complete ownership of the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and a Gulf Oil gas station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s. Under the Macdonalds, the park continued to expand. Kiddieland was constructed between 1954 and 1956, and featured many smaller version of rides meant for children. Some of the rides included miniature boats, a Ferris wheel, doodlebug, and pony rides.Croushore, p. 59–63. Clinton \\"Jack\\" Macdonald became president of the park in 1957. In 1959, Macdonald and Lewis Davidson, a bagpipe director at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, started the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish highland games event held at the park. During the same year that he assumed control of the park, Macdonald was appointed as the first commissioner of the Scottish Clan Donald for Pennsylvania. The games, held annually in early September after the park had closed for the summer, became one of the largest and most highly regarded Scottish athletic and cultural competitions in the country. Jack Macdonald said of the Games: \\"We're not interested in becoming one of the biggest Games. We just want to be one of the nicest.\\" The park sustained heavy damage when the remnants of Hurricane Agnes dropped of rain on the area in 24 hours in June 1972. Lake St. Clair and Lake Bouquet, merging in the resulting flood, caused significant damage to the boathouse. The flood lifted and twisted the park's Loyalhanna Limited Railroad, which required extensive repairs.Croushore, p. 83. = Kennywood era: 1983–2007 = On January 27, 1983, Kennywood Park Corporation of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, bought the park from the Macdonald family for a reported price of $1.8 million. Ironically, both Kennywood and Idlewild were founded as amusement parks by the Mellon family. During the first winter, several changes occurred. Jumpin' Jungle, a children's play area, was added. Story Book Forest was no longer run as a separate operation and was merged with the rest of the park. What had been Historic Village was relocated and renamed. As the popularity of waterparks increased, the H20hhh Zone was added in 1985. In 1989, the park expanded across the Loyalhanna Creek by adding a trolley ride based on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a popular children's television show. The ride was designed and voiced by children's entertainer Fred Rogers, a native of Latrobe. The area was expanded the following year to include Raccoon Lagoon, an area for children. A Ferris wheel, Tilt-A-Whirl and a water raft ride were added by the end of the 1980s, along with games, new food stands and restaurants. The 1990s brought the addition of the Wild Mouse, the only Wild Mouse roller coaster designed by Dutch company Vekoma. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at Wiener Prater in Austria and Alton Towers in England, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, lumberjack and acrobatics shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In the early years of the 21st century, additions to the waterpark doubled its size and led to a new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone. = Palace Entertainment: since 2008 = Kennywood Entertainment, itself an operator of a family-owned park, had acquired other family-owned and operated parks after its purchase of Idlewild in 1983. Kennywood's owners rejected offers by larger companies to purchase the group, such as one in 1997 by Premier Parks, the company that acquired the Six Flags franchise a year later. Kennywood refused the Premier offer and others on grounds that the new owners would make too many changes to the existing parks. However, on December 11, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment announced that it would sell its parks to the Madrid-based amusement company, Parques Reunidos. The fourth- and fifth-generation family ownership of Kennywood ensured that with the transaction all of the company's parks would experience few changes and that day-to-day park operations would remain local. In December 2009, Idlewild announced that the Royal Hanneford Circus would perform at the park during the 2010 season, for the first time since 1997. For the 2011 season, the park announced that they would add a $2 million wave pool, replacing their swimming pool that had been built in 1931. The project will be the largest capital improvement undertaken by the park. The pool will be zero-entry to a maximum deep and hold 280,600 gallons. During interim time between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, it was announced that the park had permanently closed their popular attraction, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe. The attraction was re-themed, in coordination with The Fred Rogers Company to Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, the much more relevant and popular spin-off of the classic children's program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The re-themed attraction opened for 2015 season. On August 11, 2016, a three-year-old boy was thrown from the Rollo Coaster and suffered serious injuries. The ride was closed pending an investigation and remained closed the remainder of the season, and all of the 2017 season. A subsequent report from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Division of Rides and Amusements listed several requirements for the ride to be reopened, and in 2018 Idlewild procured a new train for the Rollo Coaster, which included seat belts.  Location  The park is situated alongside U.S. Route 30, also historically known in Pennsylvania as the Lincoln Highway, the first U.S. transcontinental highway. The region surrounding the park is the Laurel Highlands, and the park sits in the foothills of the Laurel Ridge. The region was prominent in the French and Indian War with Fort Ligonier located just away. On November 12, 1758, volunteers led by George Washington marched from Ligonier to aid George Mercer and his troops. At night in heavy fog, the two units mistook one another for the enemy and exchanged fire. Thirteen soldiers and one lieutenant were killed. Realizing the mistake, Washington ran amongst both groups, shouting and raising the men's rifles into the air. Washington later wrote of the incident that he never felt in more danger in his life. Though the location had never been entirely verified, in Images of America: Idlewild, author Jeffrey S. Croushore acknowledges the opinion that the event took place in a section of Idlewild that was previously a wooded area known as the Woodlands.Croushore, p. 10.  Attractions  A sign at the carousel, identifying it as Philadelphia Toboggan Company No. 83 = Olde Idlewild = Olde Idlewild is centered on the park's Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel, (PTC #83) built in 1930 and brought to Idlewild in 1931. The Carousel's music is provided by two band organs: an Artizan Style D (fitted with a Wurlitzer #125 roll frame as Wurlitzer rolls are more common than Artizan rolls) which is nicknamed \\"The Wurlitzan\\" and a Wurlitzer Caliola. Olde Idlewild contains many of the park's traditional amusement rides. On the parking lot side of the Merry-Go-Round is the wooden Rollo Coaster, built by Philadelphia Toboggan in 1938 with lumber from the park, using a sawmill built nearby specifically for the project. The American Coaster Enthusiasts named the Rollo Coaster a \\"Classic Coaster\\". Sitting in the trees adjacent to the Loyalhanna Creek is the Wild Mouse, added in 1993. The Wild Mouse was built by Vekoma and operated at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England, before being moved to Idlewild in 1993.Croushore, p. 106–107. The Scrambler, the Flying Aces, and the Tilt-A-Whirl also surround the Merry-Go-Round. Another group of rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's Skooters, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the Balloon Race, Paratrooper, Ferris wheel, and Spider. Below the Paratrooper on the north bank of the Loyalhanna are the Whip, built in 1938, and the Super Round Up. The Whip is closed indefinitely for repair. Olde Idlewild contained a Caterpillar ride until 2013. Built in 1947, Idlewild's model was one of three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the only one that still utilized an undercarriage fan. The ride was removed to be refurbished and returned in the future. = Hootin' Holler = In 1976, the Historic Village was built to commemorate the United States Bicentennial. Modeled after a typical 19th century Western town, the area included a general store, blacksmith and wood shops, sheriff's office and jail, newspaper office, saloon and restaurant.Croushore, p. 84. In 1984, Historic Village was relocated from near the gates to the center of the park, and renamed Hootin' Holler. The area contains Confusion Hill, a themed walkthrough tour with optical illusions. The park's narrow gaugeCrown Metal Products Locomotive Roster Loyalhanna Limited Railroad attraction crosses the Loyalhanna Creek to Raccoon Lagoon and back. The area's newest rides are the Howler, a spinning ride modeled like a tornado, and Paul Bunyan's Loggin' Toboggan, a log flume ride. = Soak Zone = Captain Kidd's play area The location of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names it was called the H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year.Croushore, p. 96–97. The water park has since been expanded to include body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam mats, and many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006. The swimming pool was replaced by a heated wave pool in 2011. The addition was the park's single-largest capital improvement. For the 2013 season the park added a lazy river and an expanded beach area. = Jumpin' Jungle = Added in 1983, Jumpin' Jungle is an interactive play area for both children and adults. The area includes many attractions such as a ball pit, slides, climbing nets, and a suspension bridge. Added in 2008, Bigfoot's Mudslide gets its name from Westmoreland County's reputation for the most sightings in Pennsylvania of Bigfoot, an alleged ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests. = Raccoon Lagoon = Animatronic characters at Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood attraction The park's kiddieland area, Raccoon Lagoon, was added in 1989, after originally opening in a different location in 1954. The area devoted to children-oriented rides is one of the largest in the United States. Also in Raccoon Lagoon was Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Built in 1989, the narrow gauge trolley ride was designed specifically for Idlewild by local native Fred Rogers and is based on his popular children's television show.Croushore, p. 87. Prior to the 2014 season, it was announced that the ride would be re-themed in coordination with Fred Rogers Productions to their modern children's show, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, based on the original series. The newly enhanced attraction, now named the Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Trolley Ride, re-opened in 2015.The Fred Rogers Company - Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Trolley Ride Opens at Idlewild Park = Story Book Forest = Arthur Jennings, who portrayed the clown \\"Happy Dayze\\" in the park during the 1950s, was an accomplished engineer who approached park management about creating Story Book Forest, a theme park based on \\"emotion rather than motion\\".Croushore, p. 4. Jennings did much of the work himself, including life-sized models of fairy tales. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956.Croushore, p. 51. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a pirate ship, a castle, and many live storybook characters.Croushore, p. 67–68. The entrance to the Forest is a giant storybook which reads \\"Here is the Land of Once Upon a Time ... Step through the pages of this big Story Book ... and visit the people and places every child knows ... and Loves. Here dreams are real ... and so are your Story Book friends.\\"Croushore, p. 65. Now incorporated with the rest of the park, Story Book Forest celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006. = Ligonier Highland Games = The Ligonier Highland Games is a highland games event that takes place in early September. The events primarily take place at Idlewild, while some events also take place in nearby Greensburg. Competitions include heavy athletics such as the caber toss, stone put, and weight and hammer throw. Other competitions in music include highland dancing, solo and band piping, drumming, Scottish fiddling, and Scottish harp. Vendors sell related items such as authentic tartans, bagpipes, and jewellery. While initially attracting crowds of 1,200, the festival now records average attendances near 10,000.  Recognition  Idlewild and Soak Zone is the oldest operating amusement park in Pennsylvania, third oldest in the United States, and twelfth oldest in the world. The park has been recognized by trade magazine Amusement Today with the \\"Golden Ticket\\" award for best children's park in the world every year since 2010, through to 2018. The park previously received Golden Tickets for the fifth-best children's area in 2006 and 2007 and second-best children's park for the sixth consecutive year in 2009. The National Amusement Park Historical Association recognized Idlewild as the best park for families in 2010, 2011, and 2012, having previously named it the fourth-best park in 2005, second in 2006, fourth again in 2007 and 2008, and third in 2009. The park was once named \\"America's Most Beautiful Theme Park\\".

Relief of sleeping Vishnu, now in Mumbai Aihole is from Badami and about from Pattadakal, both of which are major centres of historically important Chalukya monuments. Aihole, along with nearby Badami (Vatapi), emerged by the 6th century as the cradle of experimentation with temple architecture, stone artwork, and construction techniques. This resulted in 16 types of free-standing temples and 4 types of rock-cut shrines. The experimentation in architecture and arts that began in Aihole yielded the group of monuments at Pattadakal, a UNESCO world heritage site.World Heritage Sites – Pattadakal – More Detail, Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India (2012) Over one hundred Aihole temples are Hindu, a few are Jain and one is Buddhist. These were built and coexisted in close proximity. The site is spread over about . The Hindu temples are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Surya and other Hindu deities. The Jain Basadi temples are dedicated to Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and other Jain Tirthankaras. The Buddhist monument is a temple and small monastery. Both Hindu and Jain monuments include monasteries, as well as social utilities such as stepwell water tanks with artistic carvings near major temples. Location 7th - 8th century Huchappaya matha temple The Aihole monuments are located in the Indian state of Karnataka, about southeast of Belgaum and northeast from Goa. The monuments are about from Badami and about from Pattadakal, set midst rural villages, farms, sandstone hills and Malprabha river valley. The Aihole site preserves over 120 Hindu, Jain and Buddhist monuments from the 4th—12th century CE. The region is also a site for prehistoric dolmens and cave paintings.Gary Tarr (1970), Chronology and Development of the Chāḷukya Cave Temples, Ars Orientalis, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan, Vol. 8, pp. 155–184 Aihole has no nearby airport, and is about 4 hours drive from Sambra Belgaum Airport (IATA Code: IXG), with daily flights to Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.Belgaum airport AAI, Govt of India; Official Website , BelgaumNew terminal building at Belagavi airport, The Hindu (30 September 2017) Badami is the closest town connected by railway and highway network to major cities of Karnataka and Goa. It is a protected monument under the laws of the Indian government, and managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). History Aihole is referred to as Ayyavole and Aryapura in its inscriptions and Hindu texts from 4th to 12th century CE, as Aivalli and Ahivolal in colonial British era archaeological reports. Aihole has been a part of Hindu mythologies. It has a natural axe-shaped rock on the Malaprabha river bank north of the village, and a rock in the river shows a footprint. People also believe that this place has great significance in Ramayana. It is connected to rishi gautama and ahilya event in the epic. This is the reason that the place is called Aihole. Parashurama, the sixth Vishnu avatar, is stated in these legends to have washed his axe here after killing abusive Kshatriyas who were exploiting their military powers, giving the land its red color.Sigfried J. de Laet and Joachim Herrmann, History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D.. UNESCO, 1996. A 19th-century local tradition believed that rock footprints in the river were those of Parashurama. A place near the Meguti hillocks show evidence of human settlement in the pre-historic period. Aihole has historical significance and has been called a cradle of Hindu rock architecture. The documented history of Aihole is traceable to the rise of the Early Chalukya dynasty in 6th century. It became, along with nearby Pattadakal and Badami, a major cultural centre and religious site for innovations in architecture and experimentation of ideas. The Chalukyas sponsored artisans and built many temples in this region between the 6th and 8th centuries. Evidence of wooden and brick temples dating to 4th-century have been unearthed. Aihole started the experimentations with other materials such as stone around the 5th century when the Indian subcontinent saw a period of political and cultural stability under the Gupta Empire rulers. Badami refined it in 6th and 7th centuries. The experimentations culminated in Pattadakal in the 7th and 8th centuries becoming a cradle of fusion of ideas from South India and North India. The Aihole fort rubble walls on Meguti hill enclosing the Jain temple, which is dated to 634. After the Chalukyas, the region became a part of the Rashtrakuta kingdom who ruled in the 9th and 10th century from the capital of Manyakheta. In the 11th and 12th century, the Late Chalukyas (Western Chalukya Empire, Chalukyas of Kalyani) ruled over this region. Even though the area was not the capital or in immediate vicinity from 9th to 12th centuries, new temples and monasteries of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism continued to be built in the region based on inscriptional, textual and stylistic evidence. This likely happened, states Michell, because the region was prosperous with a substantial population and surplus wealth. Aihole was fortified by Late Chalukya kings in the 11th and 12th centuries, in an approximate circle. This indicates the strategic and cultural importance of Aihole to the kings whose capital was far away. Aihole served as a hub of Hindu temple arts in this period with guild of artisans and merchants called the Ayyavole 500, celebrated for their talent and accomplishments in the historical texts of the Deccan region and South India. An 8th-century Shiva temple was renamed Lad Khan Temple after a Muslim commander of Bijapur Sultanate who briefly lived here. In the 13th century and thereafter, the Malprabha valley along with much of Deccan became a target of raids and plunder by the Delhi Sultanate armies devastating the region. From the ruins emerged the Vijayanagara Empire which built forts and protected the monuments, as evidenced by inscriptions in the fort at Badami. However, the region witnessed a series of wars between Vijayanagara Hindu kings and Bahmani Muslim sultans. After the collapse of Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, Aihole became a part of the Adil Shahi rule from Bijapur, with some of the Muslim commanders using the temples as residence and their compounds as garrison for storing weapons and supplies. A Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva came to be called Lad Khan temple, named after the Muslim commander who used it as his operational hub, and a name that has been used ever since. In late 17th- century, the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb gained control of the region from Adil Shahis, after which Maratha Empire gained control of the region. It again changed hands with Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan conquering it in late 18th century, followed by the British that defeated Tipu Sultan and annexed the region. The monuments at Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal show the existence and a history of interaction between the early northern style and early southern style of Hindu arts. According to T. Richard Blurton, the history of temple arts in north India is unclear as the region was repeatedly sacked by invaders from Central Asia, particularly the Muslim incursion into the subcontinent from 11th-century onwards, and \\"warfare has greatly reduced the quantity of surviving examples\\". The monuments in this region are amongst the earliest surviving evidence of these early religious arts and ideas. =Archaeological site= Aihole became a significant archaeological site and attracted scholarly attention after the British India officials identified and published their observations. The colonial era scholars hypothesized that the Apsidal shape Durga temple in Aihole may reflect the adoption by Hindus and Jains of the Buddhist Chaitya hall design and the influence of early Buddhist arts. They also identified historically significant 7th-century inscriptions. For much of the 20th-century, Aihole remained a neglected site. Until the 1990s, the site consisted of houses and sheds built up to and in some cases extending into the historical monuments. The walls of the ancient and medieval temples were shared by some of these homes. Investments in infrastructure, land acquisition and relocation of some residences has allowed limited excavations and created a few dedicated archaeological parks including one for the much- studied Durga temple at Aihole. Excavated ancient and medieval era artifacts and broken temple pieces, including a complete life-size nude Lajja Gauri in birthing position and with a lotus head, now resides in an ASI museum next to the Durga temple in Aihole. Many temples and monasteries continue to be set amidst narrow streets and congested settlement. The Aihole site and artwork are a major source of empirical evidence and comparative studies of Indian religions and art history in the Indian subcontinent.Carol Radcliffe Bolon (1985), The Durga Temple, Aihole, and the Saṅgameśvara Temple, KūḐavelli: A Sculptural Review, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 15, pp. 47-64George Michell (1978), A Comparison of the Muṇḍeśvarī Temple at Ramgarh and the Meguṭi Temple at Aihole: Notes towards a Definition of Early Temple Style in India, East and West, Vol. 28, No. 1/4 (December 1978), pp. 213–223 The Aihole's antiquity, along with four other major 5th to 9th century sites – Badami, Pattadakal, Mahakuteshvara and Alampur – is significant to scholarship relating to archaeology and religions. These states George Michell, display a \\"meeting and fragmentation of different temple styles and the creation of local variants\\". This fusion and exploration of arts and ideas later became a part of northern and southern Indian architectural repertoires. Chronology Aihole monuments preserve evidence of North Indian temple architecture styles that are missing elsewhere. The Gaudar Gudi temple mimics a wooden temple design with stone, with no superstructure but a flat temple raised on a plinth with stairs, square sanctum, a circumambulatory path and southern style columned hall with northern style shrine niches. The roof mimics sloping wooden version and has log-like stone strips. The Chikki temple is another such example, that innovates by adding stone screens for light inside the temple. The stone temples are dated to the first quarter of the 5th-century, suggesting the prior temples to centuries before. Aihole was a meeting place of styles but one of several around the 6th-century CE, that were on \\"their way to development elsewhere\\". They became preserved in Aihole probably because building and cultural activity stopped there around the 12th-century. Though excavations have yielded evidence that scholars disagree in dating, states Harle, it is probable that the earliest surviving temples in Aihole are from the 6th century and later. Gary Tartakov links the temples at Aihole to 2nd century CE style and arts found in the Ajanta Caves, adding that while the Ajanta and Aihole monuments share some organizational features, there are distinct differences that suggest a \\"leap in time\\" and parallel developments in cave-based Ajanta and Aihole stone temple designs. According to Christopher Tadgell, the Aihole apsidal temples were influenced by the Buddhist chaitya- griha, but not directly. The immediate precedent for these is found in the mid-5th-century Hindu temple at Chikka Mahakuta, another place where artists and architects explored temple construction ideas. Hindu monuments Aihole was an early medieval era meeting place and a cradle for experimentation of Hindu arts, particularly temple architecture. The regional artisans and architects of Aihole region created prototypes of 16 types of free-standing temples and 4 types of rock-cut shrines to express in stone the theology of Hinduism.Evolution of Temple Architecture – Aihole-Badami- Pattadakal, UNESCO (2015) Though there is a sprinkling of Jaina monuments in Aihole, the temples and relief artworks are predominantly Hindu. The Aihole temples experimented with two layouts: (with circumambulatory path) and (without circumambulatory path). In terms of towers above the sanctum, they explored several superstructures: shikhara (tapering superstructure of discrete squares), mundamala (temple without superstructure, literally, garland with shaved head), rekhaprasada (smooth curvilinear superstructure also based on squares prevalent in northern and central India), Dravidian vimana (pyramidal style of southern India) and Kadamba-Chalukya Shikhara (a fusion style). The layout typically followed squares and rectangles (fused squares), but the Aihole artists also tried out prototypes of an apsidal layout (like a Buddhist or Church hall). In addition, they experimented with layout of mandapa within the shrines, the pillars, different types of windows to let light in, reliefs and statues, artwork on mouldings and pillars, bracket designs, ceiling, structure interlocking principles and styles of friezes. In some temples they added subsidiary shrines such as Nandi-mandapa, a (wall) and styles of (gateway). =Durga temple complex= The Durga temple is the best known and studied of the Aihole temples. It has a misleading name, because the temple is not named after goddess Durga. According to one theory, it stands near the ruins of a fort-like enclosure or durg during a time of late medieval era Hindu Muslim conflict in the region. According to another local tradition, a stone rubble durg and lookout was assembled on its flat roof and locals therefore began calling it the Durga temple. The temple was originally dedicated to Hindu gods Surya and Vishnu. The temple was dated by early scholars to the 5th century CE, but variously revised to be from between the late 6th and early 8th century. Durga temple Aihole - Another view An amorous couple at the Durga temple. The Durga temple is the principal attraction for Aihole visitors and iconic in its apsidal layout. This shape is similar to 2nd or 1st century BCE Buddhist chaitya halls found in Ajanta Caves. The Durga temple stands on a high moulded adisthana and a damaged tower that had a curvilinear shikhara. The damaged tower's amalaka crown lies on the ground. A colonnaded and covered ambulatory passage with major carvings runs around the sanctum. The mukha mandapa (main hall) and the sabha mandapa (community hall for functions) show intricate carvings. The Durga temple reverentially displays gods and goddesses from Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The included near life-size statues include Shiva, Vishnu, Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Durga in her Mahishasuramardini form killing the buffalo demon, goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, Brahma, Surya, avatars of Vishnu such as Varaha and Narasimha. The temple has friezes to tell the story of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Further, the temple has artwork showing scenes of daily life and couples, including several amorous couples in various stages of courtship and mithuna. The Durga temple complex consists of seven Hindu monuments. Next to the Durga temple is the Suryanarayana temple with a pyramidal shikara on top. It has a Surya statue with each hand holding a lotus flower in its garbha griya (sanctum), in a chariot and seven small horses carved at the bottom. The temple outline is intact, but most of the details are damaged. The Lad Khan Temple is near the Durga temple and has been variously dated to \\"about 450 CE\\", or from 6th to 8th centuries., Quote: \\"Figure 130. Aihole. Lad Khan temple. Late sixth/seventh century.\\" The temple is named after the Muslim commander under Adil Shahi Sultan who briefly stayed here about a thousand years after it was built. He used it to coordinate his military campaign in the region. The temple embeds three concentric squares, facing the sanctum with a Shiva Linga. Inside the inner third square is a seated Nandi. The two square mandapas surrounding it create the sabha mandapa or community hall, providing ample space for devotees and community to gather for functions. The second concentric square is supported by a set of 12 intricately carved pillars. The wall has floral designs. The temple inside is lit with natural sunlight coming in from lattice windows of the north Indian style. The temple roof stones include log-shaped stone strips suggestive of an attempt to mimic more ancient timber temple construction. The Ladkhan temple includes iconography from the Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. On the lintel of the sanctum with Shiva Linga, for example, is a Garuda image who carries Vishnu. The temple has reliefs showing goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, as well as other deities. A set of stone stairs connect the lower level to the second floor whereupon is a damaged square shrine. On three sides of this upper level are Vishnu, Surya and Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati). Like other Aihole Hindu temples, the temple includes scenes from daily life, including amorous couple in courtship and kama scenes. Gaudargudi temple experiments an open structure. Gaudargudi temple stands next to the Ladkhan temple, built on the lines of Ladkhan temple but more open from all sides. According to George Michell, the temple is older than the Ladkhan temple. It too has log-shaped stones, where its timber like form is integrated to serve its structural function. The sanctum is empty but has a Gajalakshmi on its lintel. An inscription engraved on the lintel states that the temple has been dedicated to goddess Gauri (an aspect of Parvati). There is evidence that the sanctum, the inside mandapa, and niches on outer walls had carved statues, but these are now empty. Gaudargudi was among the earliest temples when architects included pradakshina patha (circumambulatory path) in Hindu temple design. Next to the Gaudargudi (also spelled Gaudergudi) temple is a large stepwell for utility water storage whose walls have ancient carved sculptures. This stepwell is between the Gaudargudi and Chakragudi temple. According to Himanshu Ray, the stepwell with its Hindu shrine was likely added in the 10th or 11th century. The Chakragudi is notable for its preserved 7th or 8th century Nagara-style tower superstructure. The temple shows signs of later addition of a mandapa, whose style suggests 9th-century Rashtrakuta extension. To the southwest of the Durga temple complex is the Badigargudi (also spelled Badigergudi) temple with pyramidal tower that explores a squat and shrinking discrete squares-topped design with a large cubical sukanasa containing a Surya (Sun god) icon. Much of the Badigargudi relief artwork has been damaged and eroded.Karnataka, Aihole, Badiger Gudi, Aihole archives, Switzerland The Durga temple complex houses the Aihole Museum and Art Gallery, managed by the Archaeological Survey of India. The museum has outdoor display of excavated statues, artwork, hero stones, and temple parts demolished in past. It also has an indoor collection with best-preserved pieces of statues and temple parts found in the region. The collection includes images of Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Brahma, Saraswati, Durga, Saptamatrika, Surya, Indra, and others. The life-size Lajja Gauri with lotus head, found in Aihole, is a part of the indoor collection.Museum and Art Gallery , ASI Aihole =Ravana Phadi cave= Ravanaphadi is one of the oldest rock-cut cave temples in Aihole, located less than a kilometer uphill, northeast from the Durga temple complex. The temple dates to the 6th century. The entrance has an eroded fluted column and seated Nandi facing the temple sanctum, with several other small monuments. Inside the cave are three near square mandapas, the innermost featuring the Shiva linga and connected to the entrance mandapa by a rectangular space. The entrance of the Ravanaphadi cave has a Nidhi and seated guardian on each side. Then, on left, is an image of Ardhanarishvara portraying the equivalence and essential interdependence of the masculine left Shiva and feminine right Parvati. Past this fused image, is the first mandapa to the left of which is a niche carved space. In it is 6th century artwork showing dancing Shiva (Nataraja) with Parvati, Saptamatrikas or seven mothers of Shaktism tradition, Ganesha and Kartikeya. On the right side of the main mandapa is Harihara portraying a fused image of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, with left Shiva and right Vishnu. On the opposite wall of Harihara is Shiva with three primary river goddesses of Hindu theology, and he stands with Parvati and the skeletal ascetic Bhringi. Vishnu and Lakshmi with Garuda on Ravanaphadi ceiling The main mandapa connects to two other near square mandapas. To its north is the sanctum, flanked by Shaiva guardians at its entrance, then Vaishnava Varaha or Vishnu's boar avatar rescuing goddess earth on its left.Preeti Sharma (2007), Varaha motif in the Chalukyan Rock-cut Caves at Badami, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 68, Part Two (2007), pp. 1417–1421 To the right is a carved image of Shakti Durga as Mahishasuramardine spearing the buffalo demon. To the east of the main mandapa is an empty monastery like chamber. The ceiling of the cave has reliefs. One, for example, shows Vishnu with Lakshmi flying on winged Garuda, another shows the Vedic god Indra with Indrani on an elephant. According to James Harle, the Ravanaphadi cave is stylistically unique in the Aihole region, and the closest artwork and style is found in the Rameshwara cave of Ellora in north Maharashtra. According to Pia Brancaccio, the Ravanaphadi cave bridges the style and design of \\"the rock-cut tradition of the Deccan with that of Tamil Nadu\\". =Hucchappayya matha= The Huchappayya matha temple is about a kilometer south of the Durga temple complex on the other side of the Aihole village, relatively isolated from other temple clusters. It consists of two Hindu monuments, the front larger one is a Shiva temple and the other a monastery no longer in use. The temple is walled on all sides with stone, has steps leading into a doorway of the mandapa. The temple faces east towards the sunrise, is mostly simple and blank, but has four columns with amorous couples on each. They are in various stages of courtship and mithuna. One of the couple carvings humorously places a horse-headed woman seeking the attention of a man, who carries a shocked expression on his face. Inside the doorway is the mandapa whose ceiling has three large intricate and circular carvings, one each showing Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva on their respective vahanas. A Nandi sits in the middle of the mandapa floor facing the sanctum wherein is the Shiva Linga. The temple has two inscriptions in old Kannada, as well as a standing Shiva and standing Ganesha. The mandapa walls also show various friezes and reliefs, including more amorous couples. The temple is flat on the top, lacking a superstructure. The temple is likely from the 7th century. =Hucchappayya gudi= The Huchappayya gudi is a Hindu temple located few hundred meters southwest of the Huchappayya matha, in the farmlands towards the river, away from the village. It is simple east facing 2x2 square temple, with square front portico, a square sabha mandapa (main community ceremony hall, 24'x24') and an almost-square sanctum. The portico has four pillars, as does the sabha mandapa. The main hall is supported by four pillars placed in a square of the same size as the portico. The temple has North Indian style Rekhanagara tower with rotating squares rising in a curvilinear smooth towards the sky. The tower is damaged, the top amalaka finial and kalasha missing. Brahma carving in Hucchappayya gudi, now at a Mumbai Museum. The temple is notable for its intricate pillar carvings both in the portico and inside, as well as the artwork on its inner walls and ceiling. The carvings show religious themes (Vishnu's avatar Narasimha and Shiva Nataraja on wall, Shaiva dvarapalas, Garuda man-bird clasping two serpents), as well as the daily life of the people (dancers, musicians, individuals in Namaste posture, couple carrying offerings for prayers, flowers and animals). Some panels are humorous such as young women with horse head embracing bearded older men found on the eastern porch column. Outside, there is a slab carved with Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) of the Shaktism Hindu tradition. The temple also has an inscription in old Kannada on one of the pillars inside the main hall. Hucchappayya gudi is dated to Early Chalukya period (6th–7th century). =Ambigergudi temples complex= Ambigergudi group is one of the archaeologically significant Aihole complexes situated immediately west of the Durga temple complex, near its entrance ticket office. It consists of three monuments, all aligned to the east-west axis. The easternmost monument is square monument walled on its east, north, and south, and it lacks a tower. It faces the middle monument, which is largest of the three. The middle monument has experimented with an open verandah design concept with sloping slaps for roof cover. The sanctum is inside, and it contains a damaged Surya (Sun god) image whose crown is visible. These eastern two monuments are from 6th to 8th century, the Early Chalukya period. The defaced carvings of Aihole temples. The third monument in the Ambigergudi complex is a Late Chalukya design from about the 11th century. Its structure and layout feature all elements of the Hindu temple but it is damaged, the image inside the sanctum is missing and the face, nose, and limbs of most of its intricate carvings on the walls are defaced. The structure experiments with square and cubic shaped elements and arrangement of space. The Dravida design stands out above the sanctum walls, with repeated motifs of resonating tower structure as it rises upwards. Like other elements of this temple, the capping roof and finial is missing. The archaeological significance of the Ambigergudi temple is from the results of limited excavation near the rear wall of the sanctum foundation. This yielded red-ware bowls dated to the 1st and 3rd century CE, as well as an outline of a single cell more ancient brick temple, which probably the stone temple replaced. According to the hypothesis of Rao, the excavating archaeologist, the 3rd century CE brick temple served as a model and sanctum ground on which a more lasting stone was built. This hypothesis, however, remains tentative as additional evidence to refute or support it has not been found. According to Hemanth Kamdambi, Chalukyan temple inscriptions from the 6th to 8th century are silent about the existence of prior temples. =Jyotirlinga temples complex= The Jyotirlinga group of monuments contain sixteen Hindu monuments including a large stepwell water utility tank. It is located east of the Durga temple complex compound across the road and to the south of the Ravanaphadi cave. The temples are dedicated to Shiva, with most monuments small to moderate size. The complex is largely in ruins, except for the Nandi mandapas and standing pillars inside the temples some of which show intricately carved but damaged images of Ganesha, Karitikeya, Parvati and Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati). The temples are likely from the Early Chalukya and Rashtrakuta Hindu dynasties. =Mallikarjuna temples complex= The Mallikarjuna temple complex at Aihole The Mallikarjuna temple complex features five Hindu monuments. The main temple in this complex is dated to the Early Chalukya period, likely around 700 CE. The temple tower experimented with square mouldings of diminishing area stacked concentrically as it rose towards the sky. On top is a crowning amalaka and then kalasa (pot used in Hindu festivals and rites-of-passage functions). The smaller shrines in this complex were likely built in the Late Chalukya period. The outer walls of the temples here are simple, clean surfaces. The walls inside of the Shiva temple, particularly the pillars are intricately carved with religious themes such as a seated Vishnu man-lion avatar Narasimha, Ganesha and Padmanidhi, as well as of daily life such as a female dancer accompanied with two female musicians with their instruments. The pillars also show amorous couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy. Many of the images inside the shrines show signs of intentional damage inside the mandapa, such as the Karegudi (black pagoda) and Bilegudi (white pagoda). The complex is dedicated to Shiva, and includes a Nandi-mandapa monument. Outside the temples, within the complex, is a carved slab of Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) of the Shaktism tradition. Near the temple, is a large stepwell as a water utility. According to Vinayak Bharne and Krupali Krusche, the main Mallikarjuna temple illustrates with simplicity the core elements of a Hindu temple. It consists of three squares. A front square portico faces the east, invites the devotee to rise up the stairs and enter, leads him into a square sabha mandapa (public gathering space). The main mandapa links to a square sanctum, above which is the tower superstructure. The mandapa has 4 (2x2) pillars set in a square, each centred to form four circles that enclose the community hall space. The stairs at entrance too are in a square footprint, with two pillars. The larger temples similarly combine squares and circles as a generative pattern to create the temple space. =Ramalinga temples group= Ramalingeshwara Shiva temple's annual ratha (chariot) procession celebrates Aihole stone monuments heritage Ramalinga complex, also called Ramalingeshvara temples, is a group of five Hindu temples. These are located on the banks of the Malaprabha river, about 2.5 kilometers south of the Durga temple complex. They are clustered close to the Veniyar and the Galaganatha monument groups in a hilly terrain. The Ramalingeshwara temples are an active Shiva worship complex. It is periodically refurbished, whitewashed and redecorated for seasonal festivals. Its entrance has a modern wooden chariot with old stone wheels used for annual processions. The entrance portal has a Shiva Nataraja and two lions carvings, while the main temple consists of three shrines that connect with a common mandapa. Two of the shrines have pyramidal towers with shrinking squares concentrically placed, as does the main shrine, but two have their amalaka and kalasa a bit lower and intact. The mandapa is covered with a sloping stone roof. The temple incorporates an arched gate with a path to the river. =Veniyar shrines complex= The Veniyar shrines group, also called Veniyargudi, Vaniyavar, Veniyavur or Eniyar group, consists of ten Hindu temples. The Veniyar shrines are south of the village, near the river bank, close to the Ramalinga temples group. They are mostly in ruins, with substantial damage, and had a thick forest growth over them till late 20th- century. Archeological Survey of India cleared and recovered the space. A similarly named Veniyavur complex is also in the south side of the town, near Rachigudi temple. The largest temple here is an 11th-century temple. The temple has a southern entrance, though the main hall and shrine has again an east-west alignment. The pillars experiment a square base and octagonal member followed by inverted kalasha on top with square finish. The lintel has a Gajalakshmi. The hall consists of two fused squares (6.5'x13'). The door frame to the sanctum has tiny carvings, and the temple has some of the most miniature carvings of themes in Aihole. The Veniyar temples are dated to between the 9th and the 11th century, and represented a breakthrough in experiments by Aihole medieval artists to balance stone weight that the foundation and pillars could support while arranging a functional form, space and light within the temple consistent with the theological ideas. The so- called Temple number 5 of the Veniyar group combined function and form, creating a much taller madhyashala than any previous Aihole temple and a two- storey sanctum temple structure by nesting the stones. A simpler idea but with less fruitful results were tried in the triple Jaina temple found in Aihole village. =Galaganatha temples group= The group The Galaganatha group of temples, also referred to as Galagnath temples, is a large cluster of over thirty medieval Hindu temples and monuments on the bank of the Malaprabha River in Aihole. It is located about 2.5 kilometers south of the Durga temple and ASI museum complex, near the river dam, close to the Veniyar and Ramalinga shrines. The Galaganatha group of temples are dated to between 7th and 12th centuries. The Galagnath temples compound has three main sub-clusters, almost all aligned in east-west direction. Most are partly or wholly in ruins with signs of intentional damage, but the remnants standing have significant details and artwork. The main shrine of the Galaganatha complex is dedicated to Shiva, yet has Brahma, Vishnu and Durga artwork integral in its mandapa. The Shiva panel from its ceiling, along with several of its artwork has been moved to a Mumbai museum. This main temple is from Early Chalukya period (6th or 7th century), has a Kadamba-Nagara style pyramidal shikhara of shrinking squares concentrically placed. It includes images of river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna at the entrance to this shrine. A few other notable temples in this complex that remain in reasonably preserved shape and form include one with a nearly complete 9th-century temple with South Indian Dravida style tower, another with North Indian Rekhanagara style tower. Exterior sculpture The artwork found in the Aihole Galaganatha temple complex includes various styles of auspicious pot motifs (now common in Hindu ceremonies), Durga, Harihara, Maheshvari, Saptamatrikas, mythical makaras, foliage and flowers, birds, and others. The Galaganatha temples complex is the site where archaeologists found the 7th-century complete life-size nude Lajja Gauri in birthing position and with a lotus head, now at ASI Aihole museum near the Durga temple. The Galaganatha temples, states Ajay Sinha – professor of Art History, show evidence of unfinished wall panels in addition to the abundance of panels that represent the secular local folklore and social life as well as the religious mythologies and deities. The Galaganatha complex has a diversity of temples and styles with a pastiche effect, states Sinha, which is perhaps evidence of \\"the degree to which interaction of architectural ideas was taking place in this period in this merchantile town\\". =Maddin temples group= The Maddin cluster consists of four Hindu temples. It is one of the groups that is in the heart of the village, midst homes and sheds. The largest temple faces north, and has two small linked shrines on its east and west. The temple experiments with different pillar designs. The main mandapa of the largest Maddin temple is square and supported on four pillars made of stone unlike others used in Aihole, a greenish color stone that is not local and was imported from somewhere else, possibly from Dharwad region of the Deccan. The artists polished it, moulded a square base and then lathe-turned it intricately all the way to its neck in a manner similar to Hoyasala designs. The temple features a Nataraja, the dancing Shiva with a damaru in his right hand and trishula in the left. Near him is an intricately carved lion. In distance, facing the Shiva linga is seated Nandi in the antarala of the temple. On the lintel of the sanctum is Gajalakshmi. The towers of the Maddin temples are all stepped pyramidal concentric squares. =Triyambakeshvara temples group= Rachigudi Temple of the Triyambakeshvara Group The Triyambakeshvara group, also spelled Triambakesvara group, has five Hindu temples. It is within the village. The main temple of this group faces south and is set on a high platform. Two smaller connected shrines are to its east and west. Stone steps lead to an open mandapa, a sabha mandapa (community hall) which connects to the sanctum. The open portico has two square pillars and two pilasters. The lintel on the entrance has Gajalakshmi. The sabha mandapa is square (15.6'x15.6'), itself supported on four square moulded pillars set within the space in a square, while the side walls have twelve pilasters. The upper part of the four square pillars are circular. It is connected to an antechamber and the sanctum. The sanctum is dedicated to Shiva linga, while a near life-size Nandi sits facing the sanctum inside the shrine. On the lintel to the sanctum is carved another Gajalakshmi (Lakshmi with two elephants spraying water). The damaged towers of the main and the attached smaller shrines are all stepped pyramid of shrinking concentric squares as the tower rises towards the sky. Two smaller temples in the Triyambakeshvara group are the Desiyar temple and the Rachigudi temple. Both feature a square main community ceremony hall, but different roof than the main temple of this group. The Desiyar temple has a seated, lotus-holding Lakshmi carved on the entrance. It has a bhumi-style tower, and has a Nandi sitting outside. The Rachigudi features a sloping stone roof of the style now found in Hindu temples of southwestern India. The outside wall has floral and other carvings. The temple consists of the main shrine, plus two subsidiary shrines to its east and west. The inside of the Rachigudi temple is a square layout, set on square base pillars with rounded moulded shaft supporting the roof and a moulded inverted kalasha pot-like shape at its top. The portico of the temple is square (17'x17'), is of kakasanas style with eight squat pillars, again with square base, followed by an exploration of octagonal form. The Rachigudi has some intricately carved artwork inside, such as of Gajalakshmi on the lintel. The door jambs explore floral and geometric designs, as do the small perforated windows in the sabha mandapa integrated to bring light into the temple. The Triyambakeshvara group including the Rachigudi Hindu temple is from the 10th to 11th centuries, bridging the Rashtrakuta and Late Chalukya periods. =Kuntigudi complex= Kunti group colonnade The Kunti group of monuments, also referred to as the Konti-gudi group, consist of four Hindu temples. They are situated in the middle of an Aihole market street with temple walls between the houses and sheds. Gupte dates the temples to the 6th century, while Michell states some of the monuments are more likely from the 8th century. The temples feature a veranda and garbha-grihya (sanctum) without enclosed walls. The temples have an entrance colonnade with square pillars and porch with carvings that have eroded with time. The carvings include natural themes and amorous couples (for example, man cuddles a woman's shoulder as she lovingly caresses him with one hand and holds him with other both looking at each other). Inside the main temple is a mandapa with carvings of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism traditions. The artwork presents unusual perspective such as the top view of Vishnu as he sleeps on Sesha, without Lakshmi, but with chakra and conch not in his hand but on the top edge of the bed; Shiva in yoga asana with Parvati seated on his side and her hand on his thigh; three-headed Brahma holding a pasha and kamandalu seated on lotus rather than Hamsa; Durga killing demon buffalo but from an unusual perspective. Similarly one of the pillars a damaged artwork with eight hands (mostly broken), probably Shiva, but who unusually carries trishul (Shaivism), chakra (Vaishnavism) and dhanus (Rama, Vaishnavism). Goddess Uma is shown in one carving as wearing a yajnopavita (along with Shiva with him). The temples also present standing Vishnu avatar Narasimha, Ardhanarishvara (Shiva-Parvati fusion), Nataraja, Gajalakshmi, Ganesha, standing Shiva with pearl yajnopavita, Vedic gods Agni, Indra, Kubera, Ishana, Vayu, and others. =Other Gudis= Gauri temple mandapa, Aihole *Chikkigudi group is at a short distance to the north of the Ambigeragudi group (7th–8th century; according to Michell, main temple has \\"exuburent sculptures in the interior\\" treasured within a plain simple outside; detailed artwork of Trivikrama Vishnu, Nataraja Shiva, Brahma-Vishnu- Mahesh Hindu trinity and others) *Tarabasappa temple (6th-7th century, earliest separation of sanctum from the main gathering hall) *Hucchimalli temple (operating in late 6th century per 708 CE inscription, an intricate carving of Kartikeya, Shaivism tradition) *Aralibasappa temple (9th century, Ganga and Yamuna river goddesses carving, Shaivism tradition) *Gauri temple (12th century, intricately carved Durga, Shaiva and Vaishnava carvings and images, now Shaktism tradition but may have belonged to the Vaishnava then Shaiva tradition earlier) *Sangameshwara temple and Siddanakolla (6th–8th century, Saptamatrikas and Lajja Gauri of the Shaktism tradition) Buddhist monuments Two storeyed Buddhist temple in Aihole There is one Buddhist monument in Aihole, on the Meguti hill. It is a partly rock-cut two-storeyed temple, a few steps below the crest of the hill and the Jain Meguti hill temple. In front of the temple is a damaged Buddha statue, one without a head, probably taken out from inside the temple. The two levels of the temple are open and feature four full carved square pillars and two partial pillars on two side walls. Each pair of pillar goes into the hill to form a small monastery like chamber. The doorway to the lower level chamber is intricately carved, while the central bay on the upper level has a Buddha relief showing him seated under a parasol. The temple is dated to late 6th-century. Jain monuments Aihole preserves four collection of about ten Jain monuments from the 6th to 12th century CE, associated with the Meena Basti (also referred to as Mina Basadi). These are found on the Meguti hill, Chanranthi matha, Yoginarayana complex and an early Jaina cave temple. =Meguti hill= Meguti hill Jain temple The Meguti Jain temple is on the level-topped Meguti hill, surrounded by the Aihole fort. The north-facing temple is dedicated to a Jain Tirthankara Mahavira. The word \\"Meguti\\" is a corruption of the word \\"Megudi\\" and means \\"upper temple\\". The temple has an open portico, leading the devotee into a mandapa and the sanctum. The entire temple sits on a raised platform like many of the Hindu temples in the village. However, the layout inside is distinct. It has a pillared square mukhya-mandapa (main hall), which enters into a narrower square antarala divided into two compartments at different levels. A stair connects the slightly higher level, which leads to the larger square-shaped chamber and sanctum. This section consists of two concentric squares, the inner square being the sanctum, and the space between the outer square and inner square being the pradakshina patha (circumambulation path). However, in the back of this path, a later construction sealed the circumambulation passage, making it more suitable for storage. Inside the inner square is a relatively crude carving of a Tirthankara. In contrast to the crudeness of this carving is the intricate carving of Ambika with attendant female Jaina deities and her lion mount below of the temple, now preserved in the ASI museum in Aihole. A similar carving is found attending the Mahavira in Jain Ellora Caves, and it is therefore likely that this temple was a dedication to the Mahavira. The temple includes a stone stair connecting the lower level to its upper. Though badly damaged, the upper level has a Jain image. It is also a viewpoint to look over the fort as well to watch the Aihole village below. The temple foundation moldings rhythmically project the plastered walls of the temple. The temple is not complete, as the niches and walls where carvings would be, are either cut but empty or left uncut and left raised. The temple had a tower, but it is lost and has been replaced by a rooftop watch room like empty chamber added much later and that does not flow with the rest of temple. The mouldings around the foundation have carvings of Jaina motifs such as seated Jinas meditating. Aihole Sanskrit inscription from 634 CE. Meguti Aihole inscription The Meguti temple is historically important for its Aihole Prashasti inscription. A slab on the outer side wall of the temple is in Sanskrit language and Old Kannada script. It is dated to Saka 556 (634 CE), and is a poem in a variety of Sanskrit metre by Jain Poet Ravikirti who is also the adviser to the king Pulakeshin II. This inscription has initial verses dedicated to Lord Jina’s eulogy. The inscription mentions the poets Kalidasa and Bharavi, whose Mahabharata-related compositions are subject of friezes in Badami-Aihole-Pattadakal region. The inscription records the Chalukya family and his royal patron's support in the construction of the Meguti Jain temple.; For original paper, see F. Kielhorn, Aihole Inscription of Pulikesin II, Saka Samvat 556, Epigraphica Indica Volume 6 (1981) =Jain cave temple= 7th–8th century Jain cave temple. The Jain cave temple is to the south of village, on the Meguti hill. It is likely from the late 6th century or early 7th. The outside is plain, but the cave is intricately embellished inside. The carvings carry symbolic Jain motifs, such as the mythical giant makaras disgorging tiny humans and lotus petals decorations. Inside its vestibule, on each side are two major reliefs of Parshvanatha with snake canopy above him and Bahubali with vines wrapped around his two legs. Both these images have female attendants next to them. The vestibule leads to the sanctum, flanked by two armed guards who also hold lotuses, with an enthroned seated inside. The cave has a side chamber, where too is a seated Jina surrounded by mostly female devotees with offerings and worship position. =Yoginarayana group= Another cluster of Jain monuments is the Yoginarayana group, near the Gauri temple. It consists of four temples, dedicated to the Mahavira and the Parshvanatha. Two face the north, one west, and another east, all likely from the 11th century. The pillars of the temples have intricate carvings. Their towers are same as the stepped squares found in Hindu pyramidal-style shikaras in Aihole. This collection has a polished basalt image of Parshvanatha, with a five-headed snake hood. He sits on a platform with lions carved in its niches. Another image from this Jain temples cluster is now at the ASI museum in Aihole. =Charanthi matha group= A Chanranthi math Jain temple. The Charanthi matha group consists of three Jain temples and is dated to the 12th century CE. It features the Late Chalukya style. The main Jain temple in the Charanthi matha group faces north. It is flanked by two smaller shrines, while it consists of a portico, an almost-square mandapa (16 ft × 17 ft), an antarala, sanctum. The mandapa entrance has the image of Mahavira with two female attendants, inside are four pillars laid out in a square pattern, and the design on them look similar to pillars found in nearby Hindu temples. At the entrance of the antarala is another image of the Mahavira. The square antechamber leads to sanctum where there is another image of the Mahavira seated in the padmasana yoga position, on a lion throne flanked by two attendants. The smaller shrines also feature the Mahavira. The tower above the Charanthi matha group temples are stepped shrinking concentric squares pyramidal style. The second and third temple in the Charanthi matha group faces south. These share a common veranda. The temples resemble monastic sanctuaries. A six-bay veranda connects to these two, and the doorways have miniature Jinas carved on the lintels. The pillars of these temples are ornately carved, and both are dedicated to the Mahavira. The matha consists of twin basadi with one porch serving both, with each housing 12 Tirthankars. An inscription here records the date of construction as 1120 CE. Aihole dolmens and inscriptions Scattered in the prehistoric period megalithic site behind the Meguti temple are many dolmens, numbering about 45 and more are destroyed by treasure hunters. Local people call it Morera mane (Morera tatte) or Desaira Mane. Each dolmen has three sides upright square slabs and large flat slab on top forms roof, front side upright slab had circular hole. =Inscriptions= Poetry on stone at the Meguti temple Aihole Many inscriptions are found at Aihole, the inscription at the Meguti Temple, popularly known as Aihole inscription, or Aihole Prashasti, is the most important and is an eulogy to the Chalukya king Pulakeshi-II. Written by the royal poet, Ravikriti, the inscription praises the Chalukya king in verse. Though using the Sanskrit language, the inscription uses the Kannada script.Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 1, p.252, Gaṅgā Rām Garg, Concept Publishing Company, 1992, India, Kamlesh Kapur, Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd, Chapter 35, The Chalukyas of Badami, Brief history of the Chalukyas, New Delhi, The inscription details the military victories of Pulikeshi II. His defeat of King Harshavardhana, his victory over the Pallavas, Mangalesha's (Paramabhagavat) victory over the Kalachuris, and the conquest of Revatidvipa (Present-day Redi Port). It also mentions the shifting of the capital from Aihole to Badami by Pulikeshi-II. The poet Kalidasa is also mentioned in the inscription. Another inscription at Aihole, that of Amoghavarsha I, mentions his new administration (navarajyam geyye). Chalukya Territories during Pulakeshi II c. 640 C.E. Significance The Hindu temples at Aihole reflect a \\"meeting and fragmentation of styles\\", one that became a creative cradle for new experiments in construction and architecture yielding their local variants, states George Michell. These ideas ultimately influenced and became a part of both the northern and southern styles of Hindu arts. They are also a possible mirror to early wood-based temples whose natural decay led to innovations with stone, where the early stone temples preserved the heritage, the form and the function of their timber ancestors. The early temples at Aihole may also be a window into the more ancient Indian society, where temples were built around and integrated into the \\"santhagara village meeting hall\\" as the mandapa. The Aihole temples are built at different levels, likely because the river Malaprabha flooded and its path changed over its history. The more ancient temples have a lower level. This is evidenced by the limited excavations done by Rao near the foundation of a few select temples where red polished ware have been found. These ceramic ware pieces are dated to between 1st century BCE and 4th century CE, and likely deposited with silt around the older temples during river floods. Extensive excavation studies at the Aihole done have not been done, but the studies so far suggest that the site preserves archaeologically significant information. The Jain temples of Aihole are significant in helping decipher the spread, influence, and interaction of Jainism and Hinduism traditions in the Deccan region. According to Lisa Owen, the comparison of the artwork in Aihole-Badami Jain monuments and other sites such as the Ellora Caves, particularly the attendants, deities, and demons provides a means to decipher the development of Jain mythology and the significance of the shared iconography. =Early Chalukya style of architecture = Badami Chalukyas King Pulakeshin II (610–642 CE) was a follower of Vaishnavism. The inscription of Ravikirti, his court poet, is a eulogy of the Pulakeshin II and is at the Meguti temple. It is dated 634 CE and is written in Sanskrit language and old Kannada script. The Aihole inscription describes the achievements of Pulakeshin II and his victory against King Harshavardhana. Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II mentioned as akrantatma-balonnatim Pallavanam patim: that means the Pallavas had attempted to nip in the bud the rise of the Badami Chalukyas: The conflict of the two powers before the campaign of Pulakeshin II against the Pallavas. In the Aihole inscription referred that Mangalesha's (Paramabhagavat) victory over the Kalachuris and the conquest of Revatidvipa. According to the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II, a civil war between Mangalesha and Pulakeshin II, due to Mangalesha's attempt to secure the succession for his son, which was the end of Mangalesha's reign.

He is currently a vocalist for the bands Cruz Martínez Y Los Super Reyes and Los EnVivo Kings. He is also a former member of the bands Menudo, MDO, and A.B. Quintanilla Y Los Kumbia Kings. Talamántez was the second member of Mexican origin in Menudo. Biography Abel Talamántez Mendoza was born in Pecos, Texas, to Mexican parents. Talamántez grew up playing basketball with his elder brother (who would join La Sombra, with Cruz Martínez, owner and founder of international groups Kumbia Kings and Los Super Reyes) and three sisters (who would form Esmi Talamántez Y Viento Loco). He became a member of the famous Puerto Rican music group, Menudo, in 1992, after several group members had left the group in the middle of a scandal that had threatened to break up the band. Edgardo Díaz held auditions and Talamántez, among others, were chosen as the new members of Menudo. In Menudo, Abel got to share the stage with the only member of the group who stayed through the scandal, Mexican singer Adrián Olivares, who was the first non-Puerto Rican member of Menudo. For a short period, Talamántez moved to Puerto Rico with the rest of the band. Although the often called golden age of Menudo (1980 - 1985) had already passed, the group still had vast fame across Latin America and among Hispanic communities in the United States. It was due to this that Abel became a teen idol among Hispanic girls during his first few years with Menudo. In 1996, now with Didier Hernández among Menudo's members, the group changed its name to MDO. Talamántez kept being a member of the group, which, by then, approached a more mature audience, allowing its members to stay in the group past the age of 16. Along with the other members, Abel moved to Miami, Florida. During the 2000s, MDO kept on touring across Latin America and, particularly, in the Southwestern states of the United States. In 2003, Abel officially ended his relationship with the organization when MDO stopped performing and Díaz started a teen-based group in 2005 named Tick Tock. Soon after, he was contacted by A.B. Quintanilla, brother of slain Tejano music star Selena, and founding leader of Los Kumbia Kings. Talamántez quickly accepted Quintanilla's offer to become a member of the famed band. One of the major hits the band has had since Abel became a member was a remake of a 1984 Menudo hit, \\"Sabes A Chocolate\\" (\\"You Taste Like Chocolate\\"). In 2005, Talamántez was touring with Los Kumbia Kings. Now he's in a group called Los Super Reyes. The entire album El Regreso De Los Reyes was produced, arranged and mixed by Cruz Martínez, which due to the huge success has received platinum and gold records for its sales in the U.S. and Mexico. Rumor had it that Los Super Reyes were themselves working in Martínez's studio on another very anticipated album which was scheduled for an early 2009 release. In late 2011 and early 2012, Abel reunited with his former MDO bandmates Alexis Grullon, Anthony Galindo, Didier Hernandez, Daniel Rene and embarked on an MDO reunion tour, visiting countries like Peru, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Panama, etc. Abel currently resides in Mexico City, has his own record label \\"Abel'z Label\\" and works as a producer; having produced Marile Andrade album and is currently working on her second album. He recently launched his new project Chicodelicos, working with the nephew of the late Mexican Comedian-singer, Chico Che. They are rendering Che's tribute to the new generation by bringing in new sound fuses. In December 2018, the MDO band, including Talamántez released a single titled .

It was later moved to its current place near the source of the Domashka River. It was granted town status in 1781. An important development was the opening, in 1877, of the railway line connecting Samara with Orenburg. Buzuluk was a principal stop along the line, and it is from this period that the town's first power station dates, along with its first schools and libraries. Supported by the rail link and other new infrastructure developments, it now became an important rail-terminal for the transportation of wheat. The population almost doubled between the end of the nineteenth century and 1926.

This project aims to develop a network software-driven infrastructure that will run on top of all current or future network physical infrastructures to provide a way for devices to connect to each other, and through each other to the outside world. The concept of Ambient Networks comes from the IST Ambient Network project, which was a research project sponsored by the European Commission within the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6).  The Ambient Networks Project  Ambient Networks was a collaborative project within the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme that investigates future communications systems beyond fixed and 3rd generation mobile networks. It is part of the Wireless World Initiative. The project worked at a new concept called Ambient Networking, to provide suitable mobile networking technology for the future mobile and wireless communications environment. Ambient Networks aimed to provide a unified networking concept that can adapt to the very heterogeneous environment of different radio technologies and service and network environments. Special focus was put on facilitating both competition and cooperation of various market players by defining interfaces, which allow the instant negotiation of agreements. This approach went beyond interworking of well-defined protocols and was expected to have a long-term effect on the business landscape in the wireless world. Central to the project was the concept of composition of networks, an approach to address the dynamic nature of the target environment, based on an open framework for network control functionality, which can be extended with new capabilities as well as operating over existing connectivity infrastructure. *Phase 1 of the project (2004–2005) laid the conceptual foundations. The Deliverable D1-5 \\"Ambient Networks Framework Architecture\\" summarizes the work from phase 1 and provides links to other relevant material. *Phase 2 (2006–2007) focused on validation aspects. One key result of phase 2 is an integrated prototype that was used to study the feasibility of the Ambient Networks concept for a number of typical network scenarios. The ACS prototype was used to iteratively test the components developed by the project in a real implementation. In parallel, the top-down work was continued which lead to a refined System Specification. This document, referred to as the System Description, is available on the Ambient Networks website. Furthermore, standardization of the composition conceptStandardization of composition in 3GPP is addressed in 3GPP.  Interfaces and their use  The ACS (Ambient Control Space) is the internal of an ambient network. It has the functions that can be accessed and it is in full control of the resources of the network. The Ambient Networks infrastructure does not deal with nodes, instead it deals with networks, though at the beginning, all the \\"networks\\" might only consist of just one node: these \\"networks\\" need to merge to form a network in the original sense of the word. A composition establishment consists of the negotiation and then the realization of a Composition Agreement. This merging can happen be fully automatic. The decision to merge or not is decided using pre-configured policies. There are three interfaces present to communicate with an ACS. These are: *ANI: Ambient Network Interface. If a network wants to join in, it has to do so through this interface. *ASI: Ambient Service Interface. If a function needs to be accessed inside the ACS, this Interface is used. *ARI: Ambient Resource Interface. If a resource inside a network needs to be accessed (e.g. the volume of the traffic), this interface is used. Interfaces are used to hide the internal structures of the underlying network. If two networks meet, and decide to merge, a new ACS will be formed of the two (though the two networks will have their own ACS along with the interfaces inside this global, new ACS). The newly composed ACS will of course have its own ANI, ASI and ARI, and will use these interfaces to merge with other Ambient Networks. Other options for composition are to not merge the two Ambient Networks (Network Interworking) or to establish a new virtual ACS that exercises joint control over a given set of shared resources (Control Sharing).  ACS Functional Entities  Functions are divided into Functional Entities (FEs). The ACS provides a flexible and extensible framework to run these FEs as a distributed system. Examples are * Composition Functional Entity: Controlling composition of ANs * Bearer Management FEs * Overlay Management FEs More information on FEs is contained in the Ambient Networks Framework Architecture and the latest version of the System Description.  Example situation  Alice has a PAN, a Personal Area Network on her body: she has a Bluetooth enabled PDA, mobile phone and laptop that she is carrying, and are all currently turned on, and forming a network. Her laptop also has the ability to connect using an available WLAN, and her mobile phone has the ability to connect through GPRS, though GPRS is slower and much more costly for Alice to use. She is now on the move, and her laptop is downloading her emails using the GPRS connection on the mobile: :Laptop → (Bluetooth) → Mobile → (GPRS) → Mobile phone network While walking, she passes into an area covered by a free WLAN hotspot: Her PAN now immediately starts to initiate a connection with the hotspot. This is called \\"merging\\" of the networks (that of the hotspot and that of her PAN). Once this merging is complete, the downloading of her email continues totally unaffected, but instead of using the expensive and slow GPRS connection, it is now using the newly established WLAN connection. If she now wants to browse the web with her PDA, the PDA will also use the WLAN connection of the laptop: :PDA → (bluetooth) → Laptop → (WLAN) → Hotspot References  External links  * The official site * Dynamic and Automatic Interworking between Personal Area Networks using Composition * Sixth Framework Programme * Wireless World Initiative * smartnfc.com – Intra Body Communication and Personal Area Networks * ASPAN – Next Generation Personal Area Networks Category:Network architecture ","title":"Ambient network"},{"id":"2347503","text":"The Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) is the national intelligence agency or \\"secret police\\" of Zimbabwe.Off Budget CIO funding threatens democracy It was conceived as the external intelligence-gathering arm of the British South Africa Police Special Branch in the early 1960s, under Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Winston Field.Security Forces History The CIO was formed in Rhodesia on the instructions of Prime Minister Winston Field in 1963, at the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and took over from the Federal Intelligence and Security Bureau, which was a coordinating bureau analyzing intelligence gathered by the British South Africa Police (BSAP) and the police forces of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The first head of the CIO was Police Deputy Commissioner, Ken Flower, who, during his tenure, oversaw the BSAP's Special Branch Headquarters incorporated within the CIO, while the Special Branch retained its internal security function within the BSAP upon gaining independence in April 1980. Prime Minister Mugabe kept Flower in the role of head of the CIO after majority rule in 1980, when the country's name changed to Zimbabwe. Flower had no more than a professional relationship with MI6 despite rumors that he had covertly and intermittently plotted with the British intelligence services to undermine Ian Smith's government. He had, however, an especially good professional relationship with Sir Dick Franks, the head of MI6 at the time, as he had with all the other main intelligence agencies. In addition to the information contained in ZWE38448.E of 12 March 2002, and ZWE38050.E of 2 November 2001, media reports also indicate that the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) ostensibly has powers of arrest and detention (AFP 1 Apr. 2002; Orlando Sentinel 29 Mar. 2002). The CIO is also allegedly known to perpetrate acts of violence against the political opposition (The Observer 3 Mar. 2002; Amnesty International 12 Mar. 2002). Before the March 2002 election, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) reportedly complained that its leaders were being \\"constantly harassed, intimidated and detained by the CIO and the police\\" (The Star 15 Feb. 2002). The Star quotes the Zimbabwe Financial Gazette as alleging that \\"CIO agents from the counter-intelligence unit were working with Foreign Affairs Ministry officials to monitor the activities and movements of the international observers ahead of the critical two-day poll\\" (ibid.). The Observer of 3 March 2002 reported that in 2000, an MDC \\"election agent, Tichoana Chiminya and another MDC activist, Talent Mabika, were burnt to death by a CIO officer called Joseph Mwale.\\" An Amnesty International press release of 12 March 2002 states that: Several human rights sources in Zimbabwe have reported that police and security intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) are targeting ZESN (Zimbabwe Election Support Network) monitors for harassment and detention under orders from superiors. In March 2002, CIO agents reportedly arrested a Zimbabwean correspondent for London's Daily Telegraph, Peta Thornycroft, who had gone to Chimanimani (about 480 kilometers east of Harare) to investigate election violence by the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), against the political opposition (AFP 1 Apr. 2002; Orlando Sentinel 29 Mar. 2002). Under the \\"new state security laws,\\" she was expected \\"to face charges of incitement to violence and publishing of 'false statements likely to be prejudicial to state security'\\" (ibid.). Parliament reportedly passed \\"the public order and security bill by acclamation and not by formal vote\\" in January 2002 (The Guardian 10 Jan. 2002). These laws reportedly gave \\"sweeping powers to clamp down on the opposition\\" (ibid.). Peta Thornycroft was reportedly released by the police \\"on a High Court order after four nights in detention\\" (AFP 1 Apr. 2002). No reports on the official mandate, policies and procedures of the CIO, and on what their uniforms look like, could be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate. This response was prepared after researching publicly accessible information currently available to the Research Directorate within time constraints. This response is not, and does not purport to be, conclusive as to the merit of any particular claim to refugee status or asylum. In recent years international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International have criticized the CIO's role in alleged internal repression, which is said on occasions to have involved torture. In his book Serving Secretly, Flower complained about the undue influence of Irish Catholics in top positions during his early days in the BSA Police. He thought that this matter had been resolved in the late 1940s after a commission of enquiry. The Commissioner of Police at the time Mugabe became Prime Minister, most of the other top police officers were Catholic and Irish or had strong Irish connections. The Central Intelligence Organization, otherwise known as the CIO, is an arm of the Zimbabwe security sector whose line of work is inherently classified. For a very long time the organization and its operations have ignited public debate and fueled speculation. Structure Isaac Moyo is the head of the CIO with the title of Director General. Aaron Nhepera served as Deputy Director until his reassignment to different duties in 2019. The intelligence organization consists of eight key branches which include internal, external, counter-intelligence, military intelligence, close security, technical and administration. A ninth branch is known simply as branch six. Directors who report directly to Nhepera head these other branches. Immediately under the directors are deputy directors, assistant directors, provincial intelligence officers, divisional intelligence officers, senior intelligence officers, assistant senior intelligence officers, intelligence officers, senior security officers, security officers, senior security assistants and security assistants.Zimbabwe: The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), including its structure and branches and whether its members commit human rights abuses.

The organization also offers high level security to high ranking government officials like the President, various government employees like ministers and diplomats working in and outside Zimbabwe. Regionally, the organization works with other Intelligence organizations from other African countries under a body called the Central Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA) to tackle problems that threaten the stability of the continent and hamper development, such as terrorism and extremism.Isidore Guvamombe CISSA: When the Ides of March woke up a continent, The Herald, Published: April 23, 2013, Retrieved: June 25, 2014 Recruitment The application process for a job in the organisation is not public information as in other branches of the Zimbabwe security sector like the police or the army. It would appear that they recruit people with preexisting ties, and some have even proposed that recruitment is a long vetting process to verify their suitability for the job. There have been reports linking the organization with Midlands State University. These reports asserted that the organization was targeting University graduates for their recruitment sessions.

As the two states share a Common Travel Area and () both are participants in the European Single Market, the border is essentially an open one, allowing free passage of people since 1923 and of goods since 1993. There are circa 270 public roads that cross the border.Irish border checks will be impossible after Brexit, says ambassador the Guardian 8 February 2017 Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, this border is also the frontier between the EU and a non-member country. The Brexit withdrawal agreement commits the UK to maintaining an open border in Ireland, so that (in many respects) the de facto frontier is the Irish Sea between the two islands.  Establishment  Killeen (viewed from the UK side) marked only by a metric (km/h) speed limit sign Originally intended as an internal boundary within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the border was created in 1921 under the United Kingdom Parliament's Government of Ireland Act 1920.The island of Ireland was partitioned into two distinct regions of the United Kingdom, by Order in Council on 3 May 1921 (Statutory Rules & Orders published by authority (SR&O;) 1921, No. 533). Prior to this, a separatist Irish parliament had been established in Dublin, which did not recognise the Government of Ireland Act, and was actively engaged in the Irish War of Independence. The Act was intended to deliver Home Rule in Ireland, with separate parliaments for Southern Ireland (which included three of the nine counties of Ulster) and Northern Ireland. Six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were assigned to Northern Ireland, and the rest of Ireland comprising 26 counties to Southern Ireland. The conclusion of the Irish War of Independence, and the subsequent signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, led to the creation of the Irish Free State – a dominion established for the whole island of Ireland on 6 December 1922. The border became an international frontier after the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right to opt out of the Free State on 7 December 1922. The partition of 1921 created only a provisional boundary; a Boundary Commission met in 1924–25 to fix a permanent border between the two jurisdictions \\"in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions\\". The manner in which the Boundary Commission clause was drafted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty was only explicit in its ambiguity.MFPP Working Paper No. 2, \\"The Creation and Consolidation of the Irish Border\\" by KJ Rankin and published in association with Institute for British-Irish Studies, University College Dublin and Institute for Governance, Queen's University, Belfast (also printed as IBIS working paper no. 48) Amongst politicians in Southern Ireland, there was remarkably little attention paid to the clause during the debates on the Treaty. The Republican activist Sean MacEntee was a \\"lone voice\\" in warning that the commission would involve an exercise \\"in transferring from the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland certain people and certain districts which that Government cannot govern; and by giving instead to Northern Ireland, certain other districts—unionist districts of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, so that not only under this Treaty are we going to partition Ireland, not only are we going to partition Ulster, but we are going to partition even the counties of Ulster.\\"Official report: debate on the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, 1922: 155, (22 December 1921). The interim boundary was formalised in December 1925 by an inter-government agreement that was ratified by the three parliaments in London, Dublin and Belfast, without changes from the 1920 demarcation lines.Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925 Irish Statute Book The border agreement was then lodged with the League of Nations on 8 February 1926, making it a matter of international law. The Boundary Commission's report was superseded by events and so it was not published until 1969.Report of the Irish Boundary Commission, 1925 Introduced by Geoffrey J. Hand (Shannon: Irish University Press, 1969) The Irish Free State was renamed Ireland () by the 1937 constitution, and the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 formally declared that the state was a republic with the official description Republic of Ireland while not changing its name, which remains Ireland.  Customs and identity checks  The border on the Lenamore Road, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland begins just in front of the speed signs and lies to the north of Northern Ireland at this location. Customs controls were introduced on the frontier on 1 April 1923, shortly after the establishment of the Irish Free State.Denton and Fahy 1993, pp.19–20 These controls were maintained, with varying degrees of severity, until 1 January 1993, when systematic customs checks were abolished between European Community member states as part of the single market.Denton and Fahy 1993, p.iiiPaymaster-General, Sir John Cope, House of Common Debates volume 208 column 556-7W (3 June 1992): \\"With the creation of the single market, fiscal frontiers between member states will disappear. As from 1 January 1993, there will be no routine or systematic customs formalities and goods will move freely across internal EC frontiers.\\" There are no longer any operational customs posts along either side of the border. Except during a brief period during World War II, it has never been necessary for Irish or British citizens to produce a passport to cross the border. However during the 1970s troubles, security forces regularly asked travellers for identification. = Military checkpoints = During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, there were British military checkpoints on main border crossings and UK security forces made the remaining crossings impassable. By about 2005, in phase with implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, remaining controls were definitively removed. = Dropped proposals to reinstate border controls = In October 2007, details began to emerge of a British Government plan that might end the Common Travel Area encompassing the United Kingdom and Ireland (and also the Isle of Man and Channel Islands) in 2009, possibly creating an anomalous position for Northern Ireland in the process. In a statement to Dáil Éireann, the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern assured the House that \\"British authorities have no plans whatsoever to introduce any controls on the land border between North and South. I want to make that clear. All they are looking at is increased cross- border cooperation, targeting illegal immigrants.\\" This immediately raised concerns north of the border. Jim Allister, a former member of the Democratic Unionist Party and then a Member of the European Parliament, told The Times that it would be \\"intolerable and preposterous if citizens of the UK had to present a passport to enter another part of the UK\\". In July 2008, the UK and Irish governments announced their intent to resume controls over their common border and the Common Travel Area in general. Each proposed to introduce detailed passport control over travellers from the other state, where travel is by air or sea. However, the land border will be 'lightly controlled'.Strengtening the common travel area: a consultation paper (PDF) \\"We are clear that we will not introduce fixed immigration controls on the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or on traffic from the Crown dependencies to the UK. However, mirroring activity in Ireland, the UK will consider increasing ad hoc immigration checks on vehicles in order to target non-CTA nationals on the Northern Ireland side of the land border.\\" In a joint statement, Jacqui Smith, the British Home Secretary, and Dermot Ahern, the Irish Justice Minister, said: > It is crucial that our two countries work closely together to ensure our > borders are stronger than ever. Both governments fully recognise the > particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. Both governments reaffirm that > they have no plans to introduce fixed controls on either side of the Irish > land border. The Times reported that another consultation paper was to be published in the autumn of 2008 on whether people travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom should be subject to further checks. > One proposal is expected to suggest extending the electronic borders scheme, > requiring travellers from Northern Ireland to provide their personal details > in advance. This would mean residents of one part of the UK being treated > differently from others when travelling within the country, something to > which Unionists would object. However, in 2011, the governments renewed the 'de facto' agreement. = The 2011 inter-government agreement = 2011 marked the first public agreement between the UK and Irish governments concerning the maintenance of the Common Travel Area. Officially entitled the \\"Joint Statement Regarding Co-Operation on Measures to Secure the External Common Travel Area Border\\", it was signed in Dublin on 20 December 2011 by the UK's immigration minister, Damian Green and Ireland's Minister for Justice, Alan Shatter.CO-OPERATION ON MEASURES TO SECURE THE EXTERNAL COMMON TRAVEL AREA BORDERThe Home Office December 2012 = Traffic = The border is linked with 268 (often approximated as \\"up to 275\\") border crossing points. Every month approximately 177,000 lorries, 208,000 vans, and 1,850,000 cars cross the border.The Tories' cheap promises on the Irish border could lose them IndyRef2 New Statesman, 14 March 2017 Around 30,000 people cross the border daily to commute.  The Troubles  The Troubles in Northern Ireland required that attempts were made from the early 1970s until the late 1990s to enforce border controls. Many smaller cross- border roads were cratered or blockaded with the intention of making them impassable to regular traffic. Bridges were also destroyed to prevent access at unauthorised border crossings (known officially as \\"unapproved roads\\"). In particular, the border area in south County Armagh was dominated by British Army surveillance posts. Derry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, is close to the border with County Donegal. This meant that there was a heavy security presence around the city, often impeding traffic and general movement between Derry City and County Donegal. Despite these measures, the border was simply too long and had too many minor access roads to enable control of all cross-border movements. In any case, authorised crossing-points on the border remained open to civilian traffic in both directions at all times although vehicles and their occupants were subject to detailed searches while some crossing points were closed to vehicle traffic at night when customs posts were unstaffed. Difficulty in patrolling parts of the border and large taxation/currency differences (particularly during the 1980s) led to widespread smuggling. However, greater European integration has led to roughly similar tax rates on most items and easing of restrictions on cross-border trade. Smuggling nowadays is mostly limited to fuel, livestock and a seasonal trade in illegal fireworks, which are strictly regulated in Ireland – in both countries there are restrictions on the types which can be used and a licence is required to possess or use fireworks, but in Ireland such licences are seldom issued to private individuals. While it still exists de jure, the border presents no impediments to traffic in either direction. This has been mainly due to the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as a sharp reduction in cross-border activity by paramilitaries. EU integration has also played a part. Following the Northern Ireland peace process, military surveillance has been replaced by routine PSNI patrols.  Status post-Brexit  A Sinn Féin protest against a hard border. Post-Brexit border controls are a controversial issue. The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June 2016. Their withdrawal made the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border an external EU border. The Irish government, the UK government and EU representatives, all stated that they did not wish for a hard border in Ireland due to the sensitive nature of the border.'Onus on British to resolve Irish border issue for Brexit: Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Coveney The Belfast Telegraph, 28 July 2017 In order to forestall this, and to prevent a backdoor into the European Single Market, the UK proposed a backstop agreement within the Withdrawal Agreement that would put Northern Ireland under a range of EU rules in order to forestall the need for border checks. This was opposed by the subsequent British government as producing an effective border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In late October 2019, the UK and EU reached a Brexit withdrawal agreement which contains a revised Northern Ireland Protocol that commits the UK to maintaining an open border in Ireland, so that (in many respects), the de facto border is the Irish Sea. As well as immigration and trade, a range of other issues of cross border cooperation, such as on health, Brexit: Hard border 'could risk patient care' says BMA BBC, 2 June 2017 were raised.  Distinctive physical characteristics  Map of Northern Ireland and the border The border is extremely irregular. Its irregularities were inherited from well-established county boundaries. The border is not explicitly described in statute but only implicitly inferred from the territorial definition of Northern Ireland as contained in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It states that \\"Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs.\\"Government of Ireland Act 1920, Section 1 Clause 2 (10 & 11 Geo. 5 c.67)). The border has some distinctive features. Firstly, how irregular it is: the border is about four times the straight-line distance between Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. Second, County Donegal is only connected to the rest of the Republic of Ireland by a territorial isthmus wide, making it more convenient for some journeys from Donegal to other parts of the Republic of Ireland to pass through Northern Ireland. Third, for only two relatively short sections of the border does it align with the provincial boundary of nine county Ulster between Fermanagh-Leitrim and Armagh-Louth. And lastly, as the border skirts Tyrone to the west and again to the south east, it encompasses Co. Fermanagh on three sides. As a remnant of 17th-century county limits, the border's physical profile indicates that it follows many watercourses but only in the highlands of the Cavan-Fermanagh section could the border be said to accord with any significant physical impediments to movement. There are around 270 road border crossings, with some roads traversing the border several times. Similarly, before its closure in 1957, a section of one railway line between Clones, County Monaghan and Cavan crossed the border six times in eight miles, initially with customs checks at each crossing.  Road crossings  Between 270 and 300 roads cross the border, with some roads crossing the border more than once. While some roads cross the border twice or three times, the N54/A3 road crosses the border four times within 10 km/6 miles. The larger and busier border crossings include national primary (N) roads in the Republic of Ireland which connect to primary route (A) roads in Northern Ireland. As of 2007, the busiest such roads were the N1/A1 route (Dundalk/Newry), N13/A2 route (Letterkenny/Derry) and N15/A38 route (Lifford/Strabane). Maritime border A 1988 treaty demarcates the boundary of the exclusive economic zones across the continental shelf from the south Irish Sea southwest to the Celtic Sea. =Waters around Northern Ireland= The exact division of territorial waters between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland ('Southern Ireland' being coterminous with the territory of the modern-day Irish state) was a matter of some controversy from the outset. Section 1(2) of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 defined the respective territories of Northern Ireland and the then Southern Ireland as follows:Section 1(2) of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 At the time of that Act, both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland were to remain parts of the United Kingdom. Perhaps because of this, the Act did not explicitly address the position of territorial waters although Section 11(4) provided that neither Southern Ireland nor Northern Ireland would have any competence to make laws in respect of \\"Lighthouses, buoys, or beacons (except so far as they can consistently with any general Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom be constructed or maintained by a local harbour authority)\\". When the territory that initially was Southern Ireland ultimately became a separate self-governing dominion outside the United Kingdom known as the Irish Free State, the status of the territorial waters naturally took on a significance it had not had before. Northern Ireland's Unionists were conscious of this matter from an early stage. They were keen to put it beyond doubt that the territorial waters around Northern Ireland would not belong to the Irish Free State. In this regard, James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland put the following question in the British House of Commons on 27 November 1922 (the month before the establishment of the Irish Free State): In response the Attorney General, Sir Douglas Hogg, said that \\"I have considered the question, and I have given an opinion that that is so [i.e. the territorial waters do go with the counties]\\". However, this interpretation that the territorial waters went with the counties was later disputed by Irish governments. A good summary of the Irish position was given by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, during a Dáil debate on 29 February 1972: A particular dispute arose between the Government of the Irish Free State of the one part and the Northern Ireland and UK governments of the other part over territorial waters in Lough Foyle. Lough Foyle lies between County Londonderry in Northern Ireland and County Donegal in the then Irish Free State. A court case in the Free State in 1923 relating to fishing rights in Lough Foyle held that the Free State's territorial waters ran right up to the shore of County Londonderry. In 1927, illegal fishing on Lough Foyle had become so grave that Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Craig entered into correspondence with his Free State counterpart, W. T. Cosgrave. Craig indicated to Cosgrave that he proposed to introduce a bill giving the Royal Ulster Constabulary powers to stop and search vessels on Lough Foyle. Cosgrave asserted all of Lough Foyle was Free State territory and that as such a bill of that nature would be rejected by the Free State and its introduction would create \\"a very serious situation\\". Cosgrave then raised the matter with the British government. Claims by The Honourable The Irish Society that its fishing rights in the Foyle were being violated by poachers from the Donegal side led to the 1952 creation of the Foyle Fisheries Commission under the joint authority of the Dublin and Belfast governments, which solved problems of jurisdiction without addressing the sovereignty question. The commission was superseded by the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission established after the Good Friday Agreement under the remit of the North/South Ministerial Council. For as long as both states remain members of the EU (and thus the Common Fisheries Policy), the territorial waters are not disputed in practice between the two states. Their respective exclusive economic zoness (EEZs) begin beyond their territorial waters and the boundary between them was agreed in 2014. but the precise maritime boundary between Ireland and the United Kingdom concerning Lough Foyle (and similarly Carlingford Lough) remains disputed in principle. As recently as 2005, when asked to list those areas of EU member states where border definition is in dispute, a British Government minister responding for the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs stated: During Dáil debates on the Carlingford Fisheries Bill, a contributor to the debate stated that he welcomed \\"the Bill's aim of defining the area of jurisdiction over the Foyle\\".Dáil Éireann – Volume 629 – 14 December 2006 However, the Irish Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act 2007 does not mention this issue; neither does the virtually identical British \\"Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Order 2007\\": each merely refers to \\"the Commission's waters\\". Identification A bilingual traffic sign in County Louth, in the Republic of Ireland, warning drivers travelling south across the border that metric speed limits are used in ROI, whereas the UK uses imperial units in driving. It is estimated that there are 300 major and minor crossings along the border.House of Lords; European Union Committee; 6th Report of Session 2016–2017; Brexit: UK-Irish Relations; published on 12 December 2016 by the authority of the House of Lords The border is marked only by a small number of \\"Welcome To Northern Ireland\\" road signs on the UK side, placed there by the Northern Ireland Roads Service. This can make identifying the border difficult for those unfamiliar with landmarks known to locals as the crossing point. At some crossings, there are signs welcoming visitors to the relevant local government authority district or, occasionally, reminding motorists of the need to ensure that their insurance is valid in the relevant jurisdiction. Generally, signposts in Ireland which indicate distances to destinations are bilingual (in Irish and English) and give distances in kilometres while such signposts in Northern Ireland are only in English and give distances in miles. On larger roads, the approximate location of the border can be determined by signs reminding the driver of the change in units. In Northern Ireland, place- name and street/road-name signs are usually (but not always) English-only and street/road-name signs are more standardised and extensively used. There are other immediate indicators when crossing the border: differences in the design of road signage and a change in road markings. The hard shoulder on non- motorway roads in Ireland is marked with a yellow, usually broken, line. The same marking in Northern Ireland is white and usually continuous. In Northern Ireland, roads use A (major) and B (minor) route prefixes, whereas Ireland's route prefixes are M (motorway) N (major, standing for national) and R (minor, standing for regional). Road signs in both the Republic and those in Northern Ireland are mainly black/white/red triangles or circles (the same as the rest of the European Union). Signs have subtle differences in colouring and fonts. One notable exception to this is that hazard warning signs in the Republic are amber diamonds. Since the adoption by Ireland of metric speed limits, warning signs have been placed on either side of the border to alert motorists to the change to or from miles or kilometres per hour. As the United Kingdom does not use the euro, advertised prices for service stations and shops will change currency on crossing, although many places along the border will accept cross- border currency informally (albeit usually at a rate favourable to the trader). Other typical signs of crossing a European border are also noticeable. These include subtle differences in the paving materials of road surfaces and pavements, sometimes with visible differences in colour between materials across the border, changes to street lighting when crossing the border, (though these also vary across inter-county borders), and changes in the colour of postboxes (green in Ireland, red in Northern Ireland). By rail, there is no immediate sign of crossing the border, but the trackside mileage markers change from Irish-style markers at the post (from Dublin Connolly railway station) to black-on-yellow markers, common to the United Kingdom, at the post, between Dundalk and Newry stations. Mobile phone roaming charges As in most places, radio signals from the cellular networks on both sides of the border often travel several kilometres (a few miles) across it. This was a source of annoyance to those resident in border areas when roaming charges were incurred with most service providers if the phone connects to the \\"wrong\\" network when making or even receiving a call.\\"Cross-border telecoms issues\\", Report of ComReg/Ofcom Joint Working Group, 19 January 2005\\"Follow O2 roaming move – Dempsey\\", RTÉ News, Wednesday, 8 February 2006 Inter-member mobile phone roaming charges were abolished in the European Union from 15 June 2017. , it remains to be seen whether this arrangement will continue after Brexit. Cultural references Puckoon is a comic novel by Spike Milligan, first published in 1963. It is set in 1924 and details the troubles brought to the fictional Irish village of Puckoon by the Partition of Ireland when the new border passes directly through the village. It was later made into a film in 2002. In the 1980s, Colm Tóibín walked the length of the border, later releasing a travel book entitled Bad Blood: A Walk Along the Irish Border. Following the Brexit vote in 2016, a mockumentary about a fictional post- Brexit border patrol named the Soft Border Patrol was produced by the BBC. In 2018, an anonymous Twitter account called @BorderIrish gained notability tweeting as the Irish border in the first person, and the implications that Brexit would have for it. accessdate=26 December 2019}} Border settlements The following cities, towns and villages are located on the border or not far from it (listed from Lough Foyle to Carlingford Lough): *Muff, Inishowen, County Donegal *Culmore, County Londonderry *Derry, County Londonderry *Bridgend, County Donegal *Killea, County Donegal *Newtowncunningham, County Donegal *Carrigans, County Donegal *St. Johnston, County Donegal *Lifford, County Donegal (linked to Strabane by Lifford Bridge) *Strabane, County Tyrone (linked to Lifford by Lifford Bridge) *Clady, County Tyrone *Castlefin, County Donegal *Castlederg, County Tyrone *Killeter, County Tyrone *Pettigo, County Donegal and Tullyhommon, County Fermanagh (separated by a river) *Ballyshannon, County Donegal *Bundoran, County Donegal *Belleek, County Fermanagh (part of Belleek is actually in County Donegal, as the border passes through the town but most of it is on the 'northern' side)Picture: N3 Northbound sic (with yellow margin lines) becomes the A46 (with white margin lines and speed limit in MPH).

It is so called because, if the instants of such time are assigned numbers, the set of such numbers must be non-Archimedean. Non-Archimedean future time would entail the existence of a future moment T, such that for any finite duration y there exists a moment Now + y but less than T. Note that if such a future moment T existed, there would exist an infinity of moments such that for all finite moments y' , T − y' would be after every moment Now + y where y is a finite duration. Likewise, one may conceive of a non-archimedean past. One may distinguish singularly, multiply and infinitely non-Archimedean times. In a singularly non-archimedean time, we can choose (albeit arbitrarily) a single moment T infinitely in the future (and/or the past, mutatis mutandis), such that every other moment infinitely in the future (past) is finitely in the future or past of T. In a multiply non-Archimedean time, there exists a finite set of moments S (where the cardinality of S is greater than two) such that each member of S, T, is infinitely in the future or past of every other element of S, and there exists an infinity of moments finitely in the future of T, and every instant that is not an element of S is finitely in the future or past of one element of S, and infinitely in the future or past of every other element of S.

Window with mosquito netting. A mosquito net is a type of meshed curtain that is circumferentially draped over a bed or a sleeping area, to offer the sleeper barrier protection against bites and stings from mosquitos, flies, and other pest insects, and thus against the diseases they may carry. Examples of such preventable insect-borne diseases include malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, zika virus and various forms of encephalitis, including the West Nile virus. To be effective the mesh of a mosquito net must be fine enough to exclude such insects without obscuring visibility or ventilation to unacceptable levels. It is possible to increase the effectiveness of a mosquito net greatly by pretreating it with an appropriate insecticide or insect repellent. Research has shown mosquito nets to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, averting approximately 663 million cases of malaria over the period 2000–2015.  History  Mosquito netting is mainly used for the protection against the malaria transmitting vector, Anopheles gambiae. The first record of malaria-like symptoms occurred as early as 2700 BCE from China. The vector for this disease was not identified until 1880 when Sir Ronald Ross identified mosquitoes as a vector for malaria.28\\\\. ^Murray, John. \\"Mosquitoes, malaria and man: a history of the hostilities since 1880..\\" Cab Direct 1 (1978): 1-314. Print. Mosquito netting has a long history. Though use of the term dates from the mid-18th century, Indian literature from the late medieval period has references to the usage of mosquito nets in ritual Hindu worship. Poetry composed by Annamayya, the earliest known Telugu musician and poet, references domatera, which means \\"mosquito net\\" in Telugu. Use of mosquito nets has been dated to prehistoric times. It is said that Cleopatra, the last active pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, also slept under a mosquito net. Mosquito nets were used during the malaria- plagued construction of the Suez Canal.  Construction  Mosquito netting can be made from cotton, polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene, or nylon. A mesh size of stops mosquitoes, and smaller, such as , stops other biting insects such as biting midges/no-see-ums. A mosquito bar is an alternate form of a mosquito net. It is constructed of a fine see-through mesh fabric mounted on and draped over a box-shaped frame. It is designed to fit over an area or item such as a sleeping bag to provide protection from insects. A mosquito bar could be used to protect oneself from mosquitoes and other insects while sleeping in jungle areas. The mesh is woven tightly enough to stop insects from entering but loosely enough to not interfere with ventilation. The frame is usually self-supporting or freestanding although it can be designed to be attached from the top to an alternative support such as tree limbs.  Usage  Mosquito nets are often used where malaria or other insect-borne diseases are common, especially as a tent-like covering over a bed. For effectiveness, it is important that the netting not have holes or gaps large enough to allow insects to enter. It is also important to 'seal' the net properly because mosquitoes are able to 'squeeze' through improperly secured nets. Because an insect can bite a person through the net, the net must not rest directly on the skin.\\"Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets.\\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 9 Nov. 2012. Web. 23 Feb. 2014. Mosquito netting can be hung over beds from the ceiling or a frame, built into tents, or installed in windows and doors. When hung over beds, rectangular nets provide more room for sleeping without the danger of netting contacting skin, at which point mosquitoes may bite through untreated netting. Some newer mosquito nets are designed to be both easy to deploy and foldable after use. Where mosquito nets are freely or cheaply distributed, local residents sometimes opportunistically use them inappropriately, for example as fishing nets. When used for fishing, mosquito nets have harmful ecological consequences because the fine mesh of a mosquito net retains almost all fish, including bycatch such as immature or small fish and fish species that are not suitable for consumption. In addition, insecticides with which the mesh has been treated, such as permethrin, may be harmful to the fish and other aquatic fauna. Ethiopian mother with a long lasting insecticide-treated mosquito net. Insecticide-treated nets Mosquito nets treated with insecticides—known as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or bednets—were developed and tested in the 1980s for malaria prevention by Dr. P. Carnevale and his team in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. ITNs are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets, and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. These nets are dip-treated using a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide such as deltamethrin or permethrin which will double the protection over a non-treated net by killing and repelling mosquitoes. For maximum effectiveness, ITNs should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. Newer, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have now replaced ITNs in most countries. Effectiveness The distribution of mosquito nets or bednets impregnated with insecticides such as permethrin or deltamethrin has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention. According to a 2015 Nature study, mosquito nets averted 68% of an estimated 663 million averted cases of malaria infection since 2000. It is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around $2.50–$3.50 (2–3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), and others. ITNs have been shown to be the most cost- effective prevention method against malaria and are part of WHO's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Generally LLINs are purchased by donor groups and delivered through in-country distribution networks. ITNs protect people sleeping under them and simultaneously kill mosquitoes that contact the nets. Some protection is provided to others by this method, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net. However, mathematical modeling has suggested that disease transmission may be exacerbated after bed nets have lost their insecticidal properties under certain circumstances. Although ITN users are still protected by the physical barrier of the netting, non-users could experience an increased bite rate as mosquitoes are deflected away from the non-lethal bed net users. The modeling suggests that this could increase transmission when the human population density is high or at lower human densities when mosquitoes are more adept at locating their blood meals. In December 2019 it was reported that West African populations of Anopheles gambiae include mutatants with higher levels of sensory appendage protein 2 (a type of chemosensory protein in the legs), which binds to pyrethroids, sequestering them and so preventing them from functioning, thus making the mosquitoes with this mutation more likely to survive contact with bednets. =Distribution= While some experts argue that international organizations should distribute ITNs and LLINs to people for free to maximize coverage (since such a policy would reduce price barriers), others insist that cost- sharing between the international organization and recipients would lead to greater use of the net (arguing that people will value a good more if they pay for it). Additionally, proponents of cost-sharing argue that such a policy ensures that nets are efficiently allocated to the people who most need them (or are most vulnerable to infection). Through a \\"selection effect\\", they argue, the people who most need the bed nets will choose to purchase them, while those less in need will opt out. However, a randomized controlled trial study of ITNs uptake among pregnant women in Kenya, conducted by economists Pascaline Dupas and Jessica Cohen, found that cost-sharing does not necessarily increase the usage intensity of ITNs nor does it induce uptake by those most vulnerable to infection, as compared to a policy of free distribution. In some cases, cost-sharing can decrease demand for mosquito nets by erecting a price barrier. Dupas and Cohen's findings support the argument that free distribution of ITNs can be more effective than cost- sharing in increasing coverage and saving lives. In a cost-effectiveness analysis, Dupas and Cohen note that \\"cost-sharing is at best marginally more cost-effective than free distribution, but free distribution leads to many more lives saved.\\" The researchers base their conclusions about the cost- effectiveness of free distribution on the proven spillover benefits of increased ITN usage. ITNs protect the individuals or households that use them, and they protect people in the surrounding community in one of two ways. * First, ITNs kill adult mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite directly which increases their mortality rate and can therefore decrease the frequency in which a person in the community is bit by an infected mosquito.Killeen GF, Smith TA (2007) Exploring the contributions of bednets, cattle, insecticides and excito-repellency to malaria control: A deterministic model of mosquito host-seeking behaviour and mortality. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. * Second, certain malaria parasites require days to develop in the salivary glands of the vector mosquito. This process can be accelerated or decelerated via weather; more specifically heat. Plasmodium falciparum, for example, the parasite that is responsible for the majority of deaths in Sub- Saharan Africa, takes 8 days to mature. Therefore, malaria transmission to humans does not take place until approximately the 10th day, although it requires blood meals at intervals of 2 to 5 days. By killing mosquitoes before maturation of the malaria parasite, ITNs can reduce the number of encounters of infected mosquitoes with humans. When a large number of nets are distributed in one residential area, their chemical additives help reduce the number of mosquitoes in the environment. With fewer mosquitoes, the chances of malaria infection for recipients and non-recipients are significantly reduced. (In other words, the importance of the physical barrier effect of ITNs decreases relative to the positive externality effect of the nets in creating a mosquito-free environment when ITNs are highly concentrated in one residential cluster or community.) Unfortunately, standard ITNs must be replaced or re-treated with insecticide after six washes and, therefore, are not seen as a convenient, effective long-term solution to the malaria problem. As a result, the mosquito netting and pesticide industries developed so-called long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets, which also use pyrethroid insecticides. There are three types of LLINs -- polyester netting which has insecticide bound to the external surface of the netting fibre using a resin; polyethylene which has insecticide incorporated into the fibre and polypropylene which has insecticide incorporated into the fibre. All types can be washed at least 20 times, but physical durability will vary. A survey carried out in Tanzania concluded that effective life of polyester nets was 2 to 3 years; with polyethylene LLINs there is data to support over 5 years of life with trials in showing nets which were still effective after 7 years. When calculating the cost of LLINs for large-scale malaria prevention campaigns, the cost should be divided by the number of years of expected life: A more expensive net may be cheaper over time. In addition the logistical costs of replacing nets should be added to the calculation. = Scientific trials = A review of 22 randomized controlled trials of ITNsLengeler C. (2004) Insecticide-treated bed nets and curtains for preventing malaria. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 2. found (for Plasmodium falciparum malaria) that ITNs can reduce deaths in children by one fifth and episodes of malaria by half. More specifically, in areas of stable malaria \\"ITNs reduced the incidence of uncomplicated malarial episodes by 50% compared to no nets, and 39% compared to untreated nets\\" and in areas of unstable malaria \\"by 62% compared to no nets and 43% compared to untreated nets\\". As such the review calculated that for every 1000 children protected by ITNs, 5.5 lives would be saved each year. Through the years 1999 and 2010 the abundance of female anopheles gambiae densities in houses throughout western Kenya were recorded. This data set was paired with the spatial data of bed net usage in order to determine correlation. Results showed that from 2008 to 2010 the relative population density of the female anopheles gambiae decreased from 90.6% to 60.7%.Minakawa, Noboru . \\"Impacts of insecticide treated bed nets on Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations in Mbita district and Suba district, Western Kenya.\\" Annals of Surgical and Innovation and Research 7 (2014): 2-13. Print. The conclusion of this study showed than as the number of houses which used insecticide treated bed nets increased the population density of female anopheles gambiae decreased. This result did however vary from region to region based on the local environment. A 2019 study in PLoS ONE found that a campaign to distribute mosquito bednets in the Democratic Republic of Congo led to a 41% decline mortality for children under five who lived in areas with a high malaria risk. Associated problems Malaria and other arboviruses are known to contribute to economic disparity within that country and vice versa. This opens the stage for corruption associated to the distribution of self- protection aides.Teklehaimanot, Awash. \\"Malaria and Poverty.\\" Annals of New York Academy of Sciences 1136 (2008): 32-37.

The least wealthy members of society are both more likely to be in closer proximity to the vectors' prime habitat and less likely to be protected from the vectors.31\\\\. ^Rivero- Rodriguez, L . \\"Exposure assessment for workers applying DDT to control malaria in Veracruz, Mexico..\\" Environmental Health Perspectives 1 (1997): 98-101. Print. This increase in probability of being infected increases the demand for self-protection which therefore allows for higher pricing and uneven distribution of self-protection means. A decrease in per capita income exaggerates a high demand for resources such as water and food resulting in civil unrest among communities. Protecting resources as well as attempting to obtain resources are both a cause for conflict. Mosquito nets have been observed to be used in fisheries across the world, where their strength, light weight and free or cheap accessibility make them an attractive tool for fishing. People who use them for fishing catch vast numbers of juvenile fish Jones, B.L. & Unsworth, R.K.F. (2019) The perverse fisheries consequences of mosquito net malaria prophylaxis in East Africa.

Alternatives Mosquito nets do reduce air flow to an extent and sleeping under a net is hotter than sleeping without one, which can be uncomfortable in tropical areas without air- conditioning. Some alternatives are: *The use of a fan to increase air flow.\\"House Fans and Mosquitoes.\\" New York Times. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Feb. 2014. http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/house-fans-and- mosquitoes/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0. *The application of an insect repellent to the skin; this also may be less effective (reducing rather than eliminating bites), more expensive, and may pose health risks with long-term use. *The use of indoor residual spraying of insecticides. This was a common practice in the late-20th Century. However, due to an increased awareness of the environmental hazards associated with the insecticide DDT used for some of these programs, this practice became less common. For example - American funding for African programs were cut and the number of malaria-infected subjects skyrocketed. In order to see results from the use of indoor residual spraying programs 80% of homes in the affected area need to be sprayed and the application of insecticide needs to be constant in order to suppress certain species which are immune to the insecticide.Pluess, Bianca. \\"Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria.\\" The Cochrane Library 1 (2010): n. pag.

She is the first woman to be elected to both the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. In 1962 she began teaching at Edinburgh College of Art where she continued until her retirement in 1986. Blackadder worked in a variety of media such as oil paints, watercolour, drawing and printmaking. In her still life paintings and drawings, she considers space between objects carefully. She also paints portraits and landscapes but her later work contains mainly her cats and flowers with extreme detail. Her work can be seen at the Tate Gallery, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and has appeared on a series of Royal Mail stamps. In 2012, Blackadder was chosen to paint Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's official Christmas card. Early years Blackadder was born and raised at 7 Weir Street, the third child of Thomas and Violet Isabella Blackadder. Violet Blackadder ensured Elizabeth benefited from a series of promising educational opportunities and, determined to spare her daughter the struggles she had been through, convinced her own father to support Elizabeth's training as a domestic science teacher. Blackadder's father died when she was 10. Her mother died, aged 89, in 1984. She spent a substantial part of her childhood alone, due in part to a keen appetite for reading. During her teenage years Blackadder began meticulously collecting local flowers, compiling the specimens by pressing and labeling them with their full Latin names, a fascination that was to surface much later in her paintings of plants and flowers. Education A former pupil of Falkirk High School, she donated one of her paintings to the school on the occasion of its centenary in 1986. Blackadder remembers the pleasure she derived from her art classes in particular, but also enjoying dissecting and drawing plants as part of her botanical studies; she spent the majority of her sixth year in the art room at Falkirk High School. She arrived in Edinburgh in September 1949 to start on the nearly approved Fine Art degree and graduated with first class honours in 1954. Blackadder studied early Byzantine art while at university, and one of the most enduring influences on her work was her tutor and prolific painter William Gillies. Blackadder spent the fourth and fifth years of her MA course concentrating on her imminent examinations; it was during this period that she met Scottish artist John Houston who was to later become her husband. The fifth and final year of Blackadder's Fine Art degree was spent at Edinburgh College of Art where she researched throughout the year for her dissertation on William MacTaggart. She graduated in 1954 with first-class degree and was awarded both a Carnegie travelling scholarship by the Royal Scottish Academy and an Andrew Grant Postgraduate Scholarship by Edinburgh College of Art. Career In 1954, Blackadder put the money from her Carnegie scholarship towards spending three months travelling through Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, where she focused on classical and Byzantine art. In 1962 her painting, White Still Life, Easter was given the Gurtrie Award for best work by a young artist at the Royal Scottish Academy. During the 1960s she developed her interests in still life while continuing with her love of landscape by painting landscapes in France, Spain, Portugal and Scotland and acquired a growing reputation for her paintings of flowers, Flowers on an Indian Cloth being a notable example . During her travels to France she became more aware of the artist Henri Matisse and because of this influence she ended up lightening up her palette. In the 1980s she visited Japan on a number of occasions and many of her paintings at the time showed the influence of these trips. First visiting in 1985 and returning the following year, Blackadder's interest in Eastern techniques and subject matter was realised in a series of vibrant oils and watercolours shown at the Mercury Gallery in 1991. Her desire to avoid the technical vibrancy of Tokyo took Blackadder to the Zen gardens of Kyoto; in many ways, her work depicts the principles of Zen which give paramount importance to the idea of empty space. Blackadder also traveled to the United States of America. Souvenirs of her travels would appear in many of her paintings. Blackadder began working at Glasgow Print Studio in 1985, after being invited to make prints there. She worked with master print makers from that time until around 2014, working predominantly to produce etchings and screenprint with some lithographs and woodcuts. Her subject matter was dominated by cats and flowers but also included images from travels in Europe and Japan. Honours Blackadder was the first woman to be an academician of both the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the Royal Scottish Academy; in 1982 she was awarded the OBE for her contribution to art which was promoted to a DBE in 2003. In 2001, she was appointed Her Majesty's Painter and Limner in Scotland. Along with an Honorary degree from Heriot-Watt University in 1989, Blackadder has been awarded honorary doctorates by at least three other universities. Family In 1956 she married painter John Houston. He died in 2008.

Based in Brussels, Belgium, Crammed was founded in 1980 by Marc Hollander of Aksak Maboul and has since released around 375 albums and 275 singles, working with artists from all over the world (from Western Europe and the US to the Balkans and North & Central Africa, from South America to the Middle East and Japan). Crammed Discs is run by Marc Hollander (A&R;) with Hanna Gorjaczkowska (marketing, distribution & art direction) and Vincent Kenis (producer, director of the Congotronics Series). Marc Hollander and Crammed Discs received the WOMEX award in 2004 at the World Music Expo international music trade fair, for being \\"one of the seminal players on the world music field\\". However, the label has always systematically worked with electronic music, indie pop and rock artists, and \\"doesn't see itself as a world music label: it just happens to enjoy working with artists from around the world, some of whom sing in languages other than English\\" (as stated in the label's manifesto). Crammed has been described as \\"one of the most boldly eclectic independent labels around\\" (Pitchfork), as \\"innovative and groundbreaking\\" and \\"visionary\\", a.o. for steadily avoiding to confine its roster \\"to one, potentially homogeneous category\\" and encouraging artists with plural identities to create new forms of music. In 2011, Crammed Discs celebrated its 30th anniversary by setting up the Congotronics vs Rockers project, a \\"superband\\" including ten Congolese and ten indie rock musicians (including members of Konono No1, Deerhoof, Wildbirds & Peacedrums, Kasai Allstars, Skeletons, Juana Molina and Vincent Kenis), who collaborated to create a common repertoire and performed at 15 major festivals and venues in ten countries. From 2008 to 2014, the following artists have joined the Crammed Discs roster: Chicago band Allá, indie pop act Lonely Drifter Karen (from Vienna and Barcelona), London-based Moroccan electronic artist U-cef, Congolese band Staff Benda Bilili, musician/composer/producer Mocky, Belgian band Hoquets, Belgo-Congolese rapper Baloji, Belgian-Colombian band La Chiva Gantiva, French-American artist Maïa Vidal, US bands Skeletons & Megafaun and, more recently, South African/Dutch band SKIP&DIE;, Belgian band Amatorski, Lebanese singer Yasmine Hamdan, Argentinian artist Juana Molina and Ghanaian/Swiss band OY. The label's latest signings (2016-2020) are Parisian electronic music collective Acid Arab, Portuguese singer & musician Lula Pena, young French-Welsh band Fauna Twin, French experimental pop band Aquaserge, Matias Aguayo & The Desdemonas, the new rock band founded by the German- Chilean electronic music producer, Berlin-based Spanish experimental musician Don The Tiger, French-Chilean band Nova Materia, Lagos/London project Ekiti Sound, Ugandan/British band Nihiloxica, Californian musician Scott Gilmore, renowned producer Pascal Gabriel and his new Stubbleman project, and Palestinian techno duet Zenobia. Sub-labels Because of the diversity of the label's output since its early days in the 1980s, its founders chose to create several sub-labels. This policy was discarded during the latter part of the 1990s, because Crammed felt that genre-blending had finally become acceptable. *Made To Measure A composers' series specializing in instrumental and ambient music, soundtracks and works commissioned for films, ballets etc.. Notable artists are: Hector Zazou, Arto Lindsay, John Lurie, Yasuaki Shimizu, Minimal Compact and Fred Frith. 36 volumes were released between 1984 and 1995. *SSR Launched in 1988, this electronic music label was A&R;'d by DJ Morpheus (a.k.a. Samy Birnbach) and Marc Hollander. 47 albums and numerous singles were released, ranging from early new beat to downtempo, techno, house and hip hop, by artists such as Snooze, Juryman, Carl Craig, Tek 9, DJ Morpheus, Kevin Saunderson and Telex. SSR is short for Sampleur & Sans Reproche. *Language This 'avant dance' sub-label was A&R;'d by Tony Thorpe (a.k.a. The Moody Boyz). 10 albums and 22 singles/EPs were released between 1995 and 1999, by artists including Buckfunk 3000 (Si Begg) and Circadian Rhythms (a band led by ex-This Heat member Charles Bullen). *Ziriguiboom Launched in 1998 in collaboration with Brazilian A&R;/Producer Béco Dranoff, Ziriguiboom's aim was to present original and as-yet-unexposed aspects of Brazilian music to international audiences. It quickly became one of the global hubs for the new wave of Brazilian music, and has brought Crammed its biggest commercial success to date with Bebel Gilberto's debut album Tanto Tempo (which sold one million units worldwide). Ziriguiboom also signed and released albums by artists such as Celso Fonseca, Cibelle, Zuco 103, Trio Mocotó, Bossacucanova, DJ Dolores, Apollo Nove and the late Suba. Crammed also had several specialized and one-artist sub-labels: *Cramworld (for contemporary and archival world music releases) *Selector (specialized in drum and bass) *Cramboy (for Tuxedomoon's releases) *Furax (released Belgian comedians Les Snuls) *The Congotronics Series Currently the only subsiding Crammed Discs imprints are Congotronics and Made To Measure. Congotronoics is not a sub-label per se, but a collection of releases by Congolese bands who play their own respective styles of electrified traditional music (such as Konono No1 and Kasai Allstars). The series is curated and produced by Vincent Kenis. As for the Made To Measure composers' series, it is being discreetly revived since 2013 (after having remained inactive for 18 years), as 6 new volumes have recently come out.

Gollancz was the first Jew to earn a doctor of literature degree from London University and the first holder of the degree to be ordained as a rabbi. He was the first British rabbi to be granted a knighthood, when he was knighted in 1923. Gollancz was born in Bremen, Germany, the son of Rabbi Samuel Marcus Gollancz, who led the Hambro Synagogue.

His autobiography is titled Personalia, published in 1928. He was later named minister emeritus of the United Synagogue and served as president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1905 and 1906. In the 1923 King's Birthday Honours, King George V conferred a knighthood upon him \\"in recognition of his contributions to learning\\", making him the first rabbi to receive a knighthood. He received the accolade from the king at Buckingham Palace on 25 July 1923. His service to the Jewish community included the creation of numerous synagogues to serve workers at industrial plants, visiting the sick and assisting the poor. He was an advocate for public libraries and helped establish the Mocatta Library at University College, to which he donated thousands of volumes when he concluded his 21 years as Goldschmid Professor of Hebrew. Gollancz died in London, aged 78, on 15 October 1930. He was the elder brother of Shakespearean and English literature scholar Sir Israel Gollancz and the uncle of publisher Victor Gollancz.

One of his earlier involvements in music was as member of a progressive rock band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, called Mother's Pride. Life and career Clark's original involvement with Be Bop Deluxe was as keyboardist for the band's live concerts in 1975. He could not work for them in the recording of their second album Futurama, because he was still maintaining contractual relationship with Mother's Pride. Shortly after, he joined, recording with them the next three studio albums, Sunburst Finish (1976), Modern Music (1977) and Drastic Plastic (1978), as well as the live album, , before their disbandment. He was the only full-time member of the band to survive into Nelson's post-Be-Bop Deluxe project . He was known as Andrew rather than Simon because Be-Bop Deluxe drummer Simon Fox insisted that two Simons in the band would cause confusion.Reeves, Paul Sutton Music In Dreamland Bill Nelson & Be-Bop Deluxe (2008) p. 98, Helter Skelter publishing After his involvement with Bill Nelson, Clark played on 's album (1980), notably its hit single \\"\\", The dB's' Stands for Decibels (1981) and Repercussion (1982), Peter Gabriel's So (1986), contributing to \\"Big Time\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\", two tracks which likewise became hit singles, and Tears For Fears' The Seeds Of Love (1989).Reeves, Paul Sutton Music In Dreamland Bill Nelson & Be-Bop Deluxe (2008) p. 296, Helter Skelter publishing References External links *Where Are They Now?

Baháʼí teachings stress the importance of implementing this principle in individual, family, and community life. Nevertheless, the Baháʼí notion of the full spiritual and social equality of the two sexes does not imply sameness, so that gender distinction and differentiation are observed in certain areas of life. Significantly, while women can and do serve in an extensive range of elected and appointed positions within the faith at both national and international levels, they are not permitted to serve as members of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith. Equality The equality of men and women is a fundamental Baháʼí principle, that is explicit in the writings of Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, and particularly in the writings and discourses of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, his son and chosen interpreter. The teaching and its vision of the community is central to Baháʼí community life as is implemented at a practical level. The Baháʼí teachings state that women are not inferior to men, and should not be subordinate to men in aspects of social life. In fact, the education of daughters is held to be more important than, and therefore to take precedence over, that of sons. In the Baháʼí view, women have always been equal to men, and the reason why women have so far not achieved this equality is due to the lack of adequate educational and social opportunities, and because men have used their greater physical strength to prevent women from developing their true potential. =Spiritual station= Baháʼu'lláh noted that there was no distinction in the spiritual stations of men and women, and that women and men were equal in the sight of God. Baháʼu'lláh wrote: Instead of their gender, Baháʼu'lláh wrote that the spiritual station of each person depends on their recognition and devotion to God. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá stated that God did not differentiate between people based on gender and that all were made in the image of God. He further stated that both women and men have the same potential for intelligence, virtue and prowess. =Advancement of humanity and prerequisite to peace= ʻAbdu'l-Bahá stated that gender equality was not simply righting historical social injustices against women, but would serve as a key factor in wide-ranging societal changes that would help develop a new civilization in which more 'feminine' qualities such as tender-heartedness and receptivity would balance previously dominant 'masculine' forces. The Baháʼí writings state that until women are provided equal status to men, humanity cannot advance or progress. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in a series of analogies has compared men and women to the two wings of a bird and the two hands of a human body and stated that both need to be strong to allow for advancement. ʻAbdu'l-Baha wrote: Both Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote that an important aspect of world unity will be a greater balance between feminine and masculine influences on society, and stated that because of the greater feminine influence that wars will cease and a permanent peace attained. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote that women, as mothers, would be a force in establishing peace as they would oppose sending their children to war. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote: Moojan Momen writes that the goal of achieving equality of women and men in the Baháʼí Faith does not amount to bringing women into power in masculine roles, but instead a more radical change to the very nature of society, to make feminine qualities more valued. =Education of women= In the Baháʼí view, women have always been equal to men, and the reason why women have not achieved this equality yet is because of the lack of adequate educational and social opportunities. Thus Baháʼí teachings stress the need for women's education, not only as a means to increase opportunity for women to help achieve equality, but also since the education of mothers is essential to the proper upbringing of children. Because of the importance of the education of women, the education of daughters takes precedence over that of sons when financial resources do not exist to educate all of the children of a family. Despite the linkage between motherhood and education, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá encouraged women to excel in arts and sciences, and stated that women's participation in the political sphere would be a prerequisite for peace.  Dignity of women in the Baháʼí Faith  Over a century ago, Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, proclaimed the equality of man and woman. He included it as an integral element of the social order he envisioned. He supported it by laws requiring the same standard of education for women as for men, and equality of rights in society. The Baha'i concept of the equality of women and men must be understood in the context of the pivotal principle of the Baha'i Faith—the oneness of humankind. It is a principle that addresses itself to relationships at all levels of society: relationships between individuals, within the family, within the community; relationships between individuals and their respective communities and social institutions; relationships between individuals and the natural environment; as well as relationships among nation states. The vision of the Baháʼí Faith is the creation of conditions—social, spiritual, and material—that enable the oneness of humanity to be expressed in the structure and relationships at all levels of society. The following are two quotes from ʻAbdu'l-Bahá: Historical women figures in Baháʼí history There have been a large number of women heroines who are celebrated in the history of the Baháʼí Faith including Khadíjih-Bagum, Táhirih, Navváb, Queen Marie, Bahíyyih Khánum, Martha Root, Leonora Armstrong, Lidia Zamenhof, and many others. =Táhirih= Táhirih was an influential poet and follower of the Bábí faith, the predecessor to the Baháʼí Faith, and often mentioned in Baháʼí literature as an example of courage in the struggle for women's rights. While the writings of Táhirih do not address the issue of women's rights precisely, Táhirih experienced the Báb's revelation as liberating, and broke with Islamic practices that were expected of women, such as appearing in public without a veil at the Conference of Badasht. Her actions which were out of norm caused controversy in the community and some saw her as scandalous or unchaste. To combat the attitudes of the community against Táhirih, the Báb gave her the title Táhirih, meaning the \\"pure.\\" An unverified quote has been attributed to Táhirih by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá about her final utterance in 1852: \\"You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.\\" According to some scholars this quote is \\"perhaps apocryphal\\". =Bahíyyih Khánum= Bahíyyih Khánum in 1895 Bahíyyih Khánum was born in 1846 and was the eldest daughter of Baháʼu'lláh and Ásíyih Khánum. She was entitled the Greatest holy Leaf. She was particularly dear to her father and is seen within the Baháʼí Faith as one of the greatest women to have lived. During World War I, she distributed food, clothing and medical aid to the local population suffering from starvation. During the periods her brother was away in America, and after his death when Shoghi Effendi was named the head of the religion, but away on retreats, Bahíyyih Khánum was empowered as the acting leader of the Baháʼí Faith, which was a rare position for a woman to be in at that time. She died on 15 July 1932 was buried in the Baháʼí gardens below the Baháʼí Arc on Mount Carmel; the Monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf was built in her memory at the Baháʼí World Centre. Serving in administration In terms of Baháʼí administration, all positions except for membership on the Universal House of Justice are open to men and women. No specific reason has been given for this exception, but ʻAbdu'l-Bahá has stated that there is a wisdom for it, which would eventually become clear. The only other field where ʻAbdu'l-Baha did not extend full and equal participation to women was in military endeavors, since he regarded the taking of human life incompatible with women's role as mothers. There are two branches of Baháʼí administration: appointed and elected. =Appointed= Hands of the Cause Hands of the Cause were a select group of Baháʼís, appointed for life, whose main function was to propagate and protect the Baháʼí Faith. Unlike the members of the elected institutions and other appointed institutions in the Baháʼí Faith, who serve in those offices, these are considered to have demonstrated sincerity and praiseworthy morals and qualities and achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion and an overall station above a National Spiritual Assembly(Hornby (1983), #1079, # 1086, p. 322, 324) as well as individual members of the Universal House of Justice – indeed it is the highest station that could be achieved open to anyone in the religion.Advancement of women: a Baháʾí perspective By Janet Adrienne Khan, Peter Khan The title is no longer given out. The work of the Hands of the Cause is now carried out by the Continental Counsellors and the Auxiliary Boards. Eight out of the fifty known Hands of the Cause were women (in order of appointment): * Keith Ransom-Kehler (1876–1933) (singled out as the first woman Hand of the Cause and first American martyr) * Martha Root (1872–1939) (singled out as the foremost Hand of the Cause of the first Baháʼí century and the \\"first finest fruit\\" of the Formative Age.) * Dorothy Beecher Baker (1898–1954) * Amelia Engelder Collins (1873–1962) * Clara Dunn (1869–1960) * Corinne Knight True (1861–1961) * Rúhíyyih Khánum (1910–2000) * Agnes Baldwin Alexander (1875–1971) During the period between the death of Shoghi Effendi and the election of the Universal House of Justice the Hands of the Cause held a convocation from which they constituted a body of nine from among their number to serve in the Holy Land and to act as Custodians of the Baháʼí Faith, a body which functioned without officers and with a quorum of five, whose duties included taking care of Baháʼí World Center properties and other assets; corresponding with and advising National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies; acting on behalf of the Baháʼí Faith for its protection; and maintaining close contact with the rest of the Hands, who would henceforth devote their time to the successful completion of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade. The Hands of the Cause maintained the number of Custodians, replacing those who died or were unable, for health or personal reasons, to remain at the Baháʼí World Center permanently. Of these nine, 2 women served as Custodians: Amelia Collins and Rúhíyyih Khánum. International Baháʼí Council The International Baháʼí Council was a nine-member council as a precursor to the Universal House of Justice, which replaced it in 1963. In March 1951 Shoghi Effendi began appointing its membership* and in 1961 elections were held (and once elections were the rule, Hands of the Cause were exempted from being members.) The women members of the International Baháʼí Council, and their dates of their service were:* Baháʼí World, Vol 12, pp. 395-401 Rúhíyyih Khanum (1951–61) Liaison with Shoghi Effendi; Hand of the Cause of God *Amelia Collins (1951–61) Vice president; Hand of the Cause *Jessie Revell (1951–63) Treasurer *Ethel Revell (1951–63) Western Assistant Secretary *Gladys Weeden (1951–52) *Sylvia Ioas (1955–61) *Mildred Mottahedeh (1961–63) Continental Counsellors After the election of the Universal House of Justice, boards of counsellors were created in 1973 by appointment who outrank the national assemblies, though individually counsellors ranked lower than that of the Hands of the Cause.(Hornby (1983), #1091, #1094, p. 326) There are 90 counsellors – 81 serving on continental boards and 9 serving at the International Teaching Center. From a picture of a gathering of all counselors in 2005 a number of them are clearly women. The number of counselors acting as members of the International Teaching Center have varied. Initially, excluding the Hands of the Cause (all of whom were initial members.) From 1980 to 2000 there were 9 total counselors and four of them were women. Since 2000 the number of women counselors serving at the ITC has been five of the nine. Not counting the Hands of the Cause, the women and their years of service are: * Florence Mayberry (1973–1983) * Anneliese Bopp (1979–1988) * Dr. Magdalene Carney (1983–1991) * Isobel Sabri (1983–1992) * Lauretta King (1988–2003) * Joy Stevenson (1988–1998) * Joan Lincoln (1993–2013) * Kimiko Schwerin (1993–1998) * Violette Haake (1998–2008) * Dr. Penny Walker (1998–2013) * Zenaida Ramirez (2000–2013) * Rachel Ndegwa (2003- ) * Uransaikhan Granfar (2008–2018) * Alison Milston (2013–2018) * Edith Senoga (?) * Antonella Demonte (2013- ) * Mehranguiz Farid Tehrani (2013- ) * Gloria Javid (2018- ) * Dr. Holly Woodard (2018- ) The percent of women serving as counselors rose from 24% of 63 counselors in 1980 to 48% of 81 counselors serving worldwide. =Elected= Women serve on National Assemblies. Baháʼí elections are secret ballots and electees are chosen without running for office on plurality up to the number of members of the institution. That women could be elected was in development by 1909 when the Baha'i temple unity executive board was elected in the United States. Of the nine members chosen, three were women, with Corinne True (later appointed as a Hand of the Cause) serving as an officer. The all-male administrative bodies finally were completely dissolved by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in his visit to America in 1912. By 1925 the executive board evolved into the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada. There were specific developments in the eastern Baháʼí communities in 1951. At this time women were allowed to be and were elected according to the rules of Baháʼí administration to local assemblies of the Baháʼí Faith in Egypt. (indeed some were elected officers in 1952.) However, as late as the 1970s one observer could only count two women delegates out of the more than one hundred attending the national Baha'i convention in Teheran. Yet when the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Iran were arrested and executed in 1981, the chairperson was a woman, Zhinus Mahmudi. However a statistical review across continents and for the Baha'is world population shows a general upward track of women being elected to national assemblies (see graphs.) A similar pattern exists for women serving in appointed positions. Percentage of Women serving on Baháʼí National Spiritual Assemblies by continental region Source: .

For one comparison note that in 1989 Mikhail Gorbachev abandoned the quota for female representation in the Supreme Soviet and the proportion of women immediately fell from 1/3 to 15 percent. And more women than ever before were elected in US Congress in 2009 – 74 women out of 435 (17%) in the House and 17 out of 100 in the Senate.* * The US Senate reached 19 women in the election of 2012.Women in Congress: Historical Overview, Tables, and Discussion, by Jennifer E.

By 2006 60% of nations had reached only 10% female representation in government while 10% of the countries had reached 30% female representation and use of quotas is common. In 2010 the world average for members of parliaments was 19% though regional averages varied from 23% to 9%. Meanwhile, the world average of women serving on national assemblies had reached rates of 31% as early as 1953, been above 31% continuously since 1996, and reached 39% in 2007, (the last date for which data is currently available) and this inclusive of a period \\"growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.\\" Social or professionally notable Baháʼí women Some more recent socially or professionally notable women Baháʼís include: * Dorothy Wright Nelson * Helen Elsie Austin * Jacqueline Left Hand Bull * Layli Miller-Muro * Mona Mahmudnizhad * Patricia Locke * Zhang Xin * Zia Mody Social initiatives Students of School for Girls, Tehran, 13 August 1933. The school was closed by government decree in 1934. Source: History of Baháʼí Educational Efforts in Iran. The Baháʼí Faith's emphasis is on male-female equality and thus the Baháʼí Faith actively promotes a number of programs with the aim of the advancement of women with greater access for women to health, education, child-care, and business opportunities. In the early 1900s Baháʼí women became active in seeking advancement and were encouraged by ʻAbdu'l-Baha and were thus able to gain a position of equality in Baháʼí administration. In Iran, education for girls was started by a Baháʼís leading to the eventual establishment in 1910 of the Tarbiyat School for Girls which helped train the first generation of Iranian professional women. By the 1970s, while the majority of Iranian women were illiterate, most Baháʼí women could read and write. Since the International Women's Year in 1975, the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Baháʼís, has repeatedly called national Baháʼí communities to promote the equal participation of women in Baháʼí activities. In 1993, the Baháʼí International Community established the Office of the Advancement of Women in New York City at the United Nations, and various national communities have also created their own offices. Activities in these programmes include the promotion of girls' education, literacy, rural health care, and income-generating skills. The Baháʼí-inspired Tahirih Justice Center and the Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore in India are projects that have received particular attention. Layli Miller-Muro founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum case in which she was involved as a student attorney. Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. , the organization had assisted more than 4,000 women and children fleeing from a wide variety of abuses. The Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women was founded in 1985 in India and offers a six-month program for tribal women at its facilities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the institute; the women came from 119 villages, and after returning home to their cities or villages 45% of them established small businesses, 62% are functionally literate or semi-literate (which has motivated people to send their children to school), 42% have started growing vegetables, 97% are using safe drinking water, all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, and caste prejudices have been eliminated. Distinction While the Baháʼí teachings assert the full spiritual and social equality of women to men, there are some aspects of gender distinctiveness or gender differentiation in certain areas of life. One of these aspects relates to the biological fact of potential motherhood for women, and thus the Baháʼí teaching that girls should be given priority in education as they potentially would be the children's first educator. In the same sense, the Baháʼí view of family life gives the right to the mother to be supported by the husband if needed. Similarly, the differences in the provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Baháʼu'lláh's book of laws, where in the case of intestacy it provides slightly more inheritance to men than women, can be seen in the same light. While most of the teachings and laws of the Baháʼí Faith between a man and a woman apply mutatis mutandis as between a woman and a man, there are some Baháʼí teachings or laws that provide preference to women or men. Menstruating women are exempt from practising the obligatory prayer and from fasting due to biological differences; these exemptions are not compulsory and do not reflect any concepts of ritual impurity. Women also do not have the obligation of making pilgrimage, although they can if they choose; men who are financially able to do so are obliged to make the pilgrimage. In terms of Baháʼí administration, all positions except for membership on the Universal House of Justice are open to men and women. No specific reason has been given for this exception, but ʻAbdu'l-Bahá has stated that there is a wisdom for it, which would eventually become clear. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá implies that women will become equal in \\"sciences and arts, in virtues and perfections\\", and are actually superior in \\"tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy\\" p. 184 – virtues identified as gaining ascendancy as the world becomes more permeated with feminine ideals to balance the masculine ideals that now dominate.Moojan Momen, In all the Ways that Matter, Women Don't Count See also *Maid of Heaven Notes References    * * Further reading  * * External links *Directory of Baháʼí Articles on Gender Equality *Principles of the Baháʼí Faith – Equality of men and women *Two Wings of a Bird – The Equality of Women and Men Gender equality Category:Gender equality Category:Women's rights in religious movements ","title":"Baháʼí Faith and gender equality"},{"id":"2347554","text":"Portrait of Sir Israel Gollancz from photographers Elliot & Fry Sir Israel Gollancz, FBA (13 July 1863 Births Sep 1863 GOLLANEZ Israel London City 1c 77 – 23 June 1930Deaths Jun 1930 Gollancy Israel 66 Willesden 3a 310) was a scholar of early English literature and of Shakespeare.

It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, adapted in part from the Western swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red\\". Berry's song told the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance, the lyrics describing a man driving a V8 Ford and chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. Berry's first single and his first hit, \\"Maybellene\\" is considered a pioneering rock and roll song. Rolling Stone magazine wrote of it, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record was an early instance of the complete rock and roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The song was a major hit with both black and white audiences. It has received numerous honors and awards. Soon after its initial release, cover versions were recorded by several other artists. The title is misspelled \\"Maybelline\\" on several releases. Origins and writing \\"Maybellene\\" adapted parts of the Western Swing song \\"Ida Red\\", as recorded by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys in 1938.NPR. 'Maybellene' by Jesse Wegman, July 2, 2000.Guralnick, Peter (1999). Feel Like Going Home: Portraits in Blues and Rock 'n' Roll. Back Bay Books. Boston: Little, Brown. p. 234. . According to Berry, Wills's version, an uptempo dance number, was his favorite song to sing at racially integrated clubs (\\"salt and pepper clubs\\", as he called them). Encouraged by Muddy Waters, in 1955 Berry brought to Chess Records a recording of his version of Wills's song, which he had renamed \\"Ida May\\", and a blues song he wrote, \\"Wee Wee Hours\\", which he said was inspired by Big Joe Turner's \\"Wee Baby Blue\\". To Berry's surprise, Leonard Chess showed little interest in the blues material but was enthusiastic about the commercial possibilities in a \\"hillbilly song sung by a black man\\". Chess wanted a bigger beat for the song and added a bass and a maracas player to Berry's trio at the recording session. He also thought the titles \\"Ida Red\\" and \\"Ida May\\" were \\"too rural\\". Spotting a mascara box on the floor of the studio, according to Berry's pianist Johnnie Johnson, Chess said, \\"Well, hell, let's name the damn thing Maybellene\\", altering the spelling to avoid a suit by the cosmetic company. The lyrics were rewritten, also at the direction of Chess. \\"The kids wanted the big beat, cars and young love,\\" Chess recalled. \\"It was the trend and we jumped on it.\\"Altschuler, Glenn C. (2003). All Shook Up, How Rock 'n' Roll Changed America. Oxford University Press. , . As Chess had predicted, the lyrics appealed to teenagers fascinated by cars, speed and sexuality. \\"Maybellene\\" was one of the first records to be a hit on the rhythm and blues, country and western, and pop charts. Featuring some inimitable Chuck Berry riffs, some blues-style picking on a guitar and Johnson's piano, which added a hummable rhythm to the steady backbeat, \\"Maybellene\\" was a pivotal song in the emergence of rock and roll. This exciting fusion of a rhythm-and-blues beat with a rural country style was the catalyst for the emergence of rock and roll in the mid-1950s.American Historical Review, characterizing the fusion of genres in the mid-1950s as a new American music. Personnel Recorded May 21, 1955 * Chuck Berry – vocals, guitar * Johnnie Johnson – piano * Willie Dixon – bass * Jerome Green – maracas * Ebby Hardy – drums Co-composers In the 1950s, some record companies assigned publishing credits to disc jockeys and others who helped to promote a record, a form of payola by means of composer royalties. For this reason, the disc jockey Alan Freed received credit as a co-writer of \\"Maybellene\\". Robert Christgau's October 1972 essay on Chuck Berry suggests this was the case for Freed's publishing credit. Leonard Chess, in Christgau's words, \\"flipped\\" for Berry's \\"Maybellene\\" and \\"forwarded it to Alan Freed.\\" \\"Having mysteriously acquired 25 percent of the writer's credit,\\" Christgau writes, \\"Freed played 'Maybellene' quite a lot, and it became one of the first nationwide rock and roll hits.\\" Russ Fratto, who had loaned money to Chess, also received credit. (Some Chess insiders have said that Chess owed money to Fratto, a printer and stationer, for producing record labels. Other accounts describe Fratto as \\"a record distributor.\\") The Freed and Fratto credits, which do not appear on the original Chess single (see the photograph above), were withdrawn in 1986. However, as of 2014, these credits still appear on some reissues of Berry's recordings. The first edition of Charlie Gillett's The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll in 1970 erroneously identifies Russ Fratto as a disc jockey and suggests that both Alan Freed and Fratto were present at the recording session in Chicago in May 1955. Bruce Pegg's Brown Eyed Handsome Man on the life and recording career of Chuck Berry identifies Russ Fratto as the owner of Victory Stationery, a print shop next door to 4750 South Cottage Grove, the location of the first offices of Chess Records. Pegg identifies Victory Stationery's owner Russ Fratto as \\"4750's landlord.\\" In an interview with Patrick William Salvo for Rolling Stone published in November 1972, Chuck Berry told Salvo that Alan Freed \\"didn't sit down with me at all and write anything.\\" \\"He [Freed] got that money solely for doing us some favors in those days,\\" Berry told Salvo. Charts In 1955, the song, a 12-bar blues, peaked at number five on the Billboard pop chart and was number one on the R&B; chart. Billboards year-end charts in 1955 ranked \\"Maybellene\\" number 3 on the Top R&B; Records Retail Sales and Juke Box Plays charts. The record sold one million copies by the end of 1955. Honors and awards In 1988, \\"Maybellene\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its influence as a rock-and-roll record. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included \\"Maybellene\\" in its list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\" (also included are Berry's recordings of \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\"). In 1999, National Public Radio included it in the \\"NPR 100\\", the one hundred most important American musical works of the 20th century, chosen by NPR music editors. \\"Maybellene\\" is currently ranked as the 98th greatest song of all time, as well as the second best song of 1955, by Acclaimed Music. The song is ranked number 18 on Rolling Stones list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

In 1964, a cover version by Johnny Rivers reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 9 on RPM magazine's Top 40 Singles chart. Also in 1964, The Syndicats featuring guitarist Steve Howe who would later play for the band Yes, recorded and published their own cover version of the song.

The takes its name from the zodiological name of the year 645 during which the Taika Reform, a transformative event in Japanese Imperial history, occurred. The incident was a successful plot by Nakatomi no Kamatari, Prince Naka no Ōe and others who conspired to eliminate the main branch of the Soga clan, beginning with the assassination of Soga no Iruka. The assassination of Iruka took place on July 10, 645 (traditional Japanese date: 12th day of the 6th month of 645), during a court ceremony at which memorials from the Three Kingdoms of Korea were being read to Empress Kōgyoku by Ishikawa no Maro. Prince Naka no Ōe had made elaborate preparations, including closing the palace gates, bribing several palace guards, hiding a spear in the hall where the ceremony was to take place and ordering four armed men to attack Iruka. However, when it became clear that the four men were too frightened to carry out the orders, Naka no Ōe rushed Iruka himself and cut open his head and shoulder. Iruka was not killed immediately, but protested his innocence and pleaded for an investigation.Perez, p. 145 Prince Naka no Ōe pleaded his case before Empress Kōgyoku, and when she retired to consider the matter, the four guards finally rushed Iruka again and completed the killing. Shortly afterwards, Iruka's father Soga no Emishi killed himself by setting fire to his residence. The conflagration destroyed the manuscript copy of the Tennōki and many other Imperial treasures which had been taken for safe-keeping by the Soga,Ponsonby- Fane, p. 50. but Fune no Fubitoesaka quickly grabbed the burning Kokki from the flames. Later, he is said to have presented it to Naka no Ōe; but no known extant copies of the work remain.Sakamoto, Tarō et al. (1965). Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei: Nihon Shoki Vol. II, p. 264. The violence actually unfolded in Kōgyoku's presence. The Empress responded to this shock by determining to renounce the throne. Japanese society during the Asuka period was sensitive to issues of \\"pollution\\", both spiritual and personal. Deaths—especially a violent killing in close physical proximity to the Empress—were considered to have been amongst the worst possible acts of pollution—an event so stunning that it would have warranted days of seclusion in an uncertain process attempting to redress what would have been construed as a kind of profanity. Although Kōgyoku wanted to abdicate immediately in favor of Naka no Ōe, on the advice of Nakatomi no Kamatari he insisted that throne should pass instead to his older brother, Furuhito no Ōe, or to his maternal uncle (Kōgyoku's brother) Prince Karu.Aston, William. (2005). Nihongi, p. 195–196; Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukanshō, p. 266; Varley, H. Paul. Jinnō Shōtōki. p. 44. Furuhito no Ōe resolved the impasse by declaring his intention to renounce any claim to the throne by taking the tonsure of a Buddhist monk. That same day—traditionally said to be July 12, 645, Furuhito no Ōe shaved off his hair at Hōkō-ji, in the open air between the Hall of the Buddha and the pagoda.Aston, pp. 195-196. At this point, Kōgyoku did abdicate in favor of her brother, who shortly thereafter acceded to the throne as Emperor Kōtoku (645–654).Titsingh, Isaac (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 47-48. After Kōtoku's death Kōgyoku took the throne once more as Saimei (r. 655–661), before Naka no Ōe himself finally took the throne as Emperor Tenji (661–672).Titsingh, p. 54.

Based on the novel Little Boy Lost by Marghanita Laski, the film is about a war correspondent stationed in Paris during World War II and once married to a young Frenchwoman who was murdered by the Nazis. Following the war, he returns to France trying to find his son, whom he lost during a bombing raid but has been told is living in an orphanage in Paris. Costumes were designed by Edith Head. Makeup was supervised by Wally Westmore. Plot During World War II an American war correspondent, Bill Wainwright (played by Crosby), was stationed in Paris. He met and fell in love with a French singer, Lisa Garret (played by Maurey). They married and had a son, Jean. Wainwright was then assigned to cover the Battle of Dunkirk and after the evacuation of Allied troops and the French surrender he could not return to Paris. He later learned that his wife was murdered by the Nazis for participating in the French Resistance and that his small son went missing during a bombing raid. This background information is presented via a flashback narrated by Wainwright. The war is now over and the grieving widower has returned to Paris to find his lost little boy. His best friend is Pierre Verdier (played by Dauphin). Wainwright has been told that his son is living in an orphanage. There, he finds a sad and confused boy, Jean (played by Fourcade), who does bear a resemblance to Lisa, and Wainwright believes he might be his son. The Mother Superior (played by Dorziat) insists that the boy is his, but Wainwright is skeptical and sets out to test him. He begins to form an emotional attachment to the boy, but eventually, when the boy fails the test, Wainwright realizes that the child has been fed information in order to help him pass the test. He confronts the nun, who confesses to having tried to help the boy because of her determination to have her orphans placed in good homes and have happy lives. Though Wainwright and the boy have formed a bond, he cannot get over his grief until he speaks to a friend who advises him to face up to his wife's death. While out and about, he has seen a stuffed toy identical to one that Wainwright had won at a carnival for Lisa, and which was named \\"Binky\\". He buys the toy and has it sent to the orphanage. The movie ends as Wainwright returns to the orphanage, having realized that he needs the boy, even if he may not be the son he lost. Jean, seeing the stuffed dog, hugs it and calls it \\"Binky\\", thus revealing that he is Wainwright's son. Cast * Bing Crosby as Bill Wainwright * Claude Dauphin as Pierre Verdier * Christian Fourcade as Jean (The Little Boy) * Gabrielle Dorziat as Mother Superior * Nicole Maurey as Lisa Garret * Colette Deréal as Nelly * Georgette Anys as Madame Quilleboeuf * Henri Letondal as Tracing Service Clerk * Peter Baldwin as Lt. Walker Production Filming took place in Paris in September 1952 and then continued in Hollywood from November to December 1952. Bing Crosby received the news that his wife Dixie Lee was terminally ill while filming in Paris. He returned to California and his wife died on November 1, 1952. Returning to the studio, Crosby had to face a grueling scene, one of the most important in the picture. The war correspondent, who had never in his own heart accepted the fact that his wife was dead, was forced to listen to the official, brutal account of her death, read by her friend. He had to realize that to go on living and to love the living, a man must bury his dead. Reception The film had its world premiere at the Beverly Wilshire theatre in Los Angeles on September 3, 1953 and grossed $22,000 in its first week. Its New York premiere was at the Rivoli Theatre as a benefit for the Overseas Press Club on September 21, 1953. The following day Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote \\"here Mr. Crosby is playing a straight dramatic role in a picture of deep emotional content and genuinely tragic, overtones. Except for two or three song numbers that are worked in consistently, there are few other points of contact with the bright and chipper Bingle of old. And yet it must be said for Mr. Crosby that he manages to convey a strong sense of real emotional torment in a tragically wracked character and that he serves as a credible buffer in a candidly heart-socking film.\\" The reviewer for Variety commented: \\"Based on the Marghanita Laski story of a father’s search for the young son from whom he had become separated because of the war, the film doesn’t come off with the tremendous heart impact of the original, or of the television version seen only a season or two back, although it does have sufficient moving moments to be satisfactory family filmfare\\" Little Boy Lost received the Golden Globe Award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding. It was entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival.

Zamos was litigation between Microsoft and David Zamos, a student at Kent State and the University of Akron in the United States. Microsoft accused Zamos of illegally reselling his student-discounted copies of Windows XP Pro and Microsoft Office on eBay. Zamos countersued Microsoft for making false claims. When Zamos sent a press release to his local newspaper, the case received international press coverage. At issue was the fact that Zamos acquired Microsoft software at a discount for academic use, then re-sold it to the general public on eBay for a profit. Zamos contends, and can document, that he found the software unsuitable when he realized it required him to format his computer's hard drive. He attempted to return the software, first at the University of Akron's bookstore, then directly to Microsoft. When both of these attempted returns were denied, Zamos put the software up for sale on eBay in two auctions, the second of which was cancelled at Microsoft's request. When he successfully re-instated the auction and completed the sale, he was sued under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. His profit was $143.50 USD. On January 3, 2005 Zamos filed a countersuit. In it he pointed out that Microsoft's claim did not represent the facts of his case, and appeared to be a boilerplate suit like thousands of others the company has filed. He exhibited a page from the claim that was identical to a page in another, except that some plural words had been changed to singular ones. The respective verbs had not been changed to their singular forms, so the page contained grammatical errors. These counterclaims seem to have failed, as Zamos was not a \\"qualified end user\\". So he filed more claims, contending among other things that the unopened software had never presented him with the End User License Agreement and thus the opportunity to become a qualified end user. This, he asserted, amounted to deceptive sales practice. When Zamos requested a trial by jury, Microsoft offered to drop their case if he would drop his countersuit. But he insisted on reimbursement for the cost of copying legal documents, and an apology for Microsoft's behavior. Microsoft refused this, and Zamos wrote a brief press release to the Akron Beacon Journal, which published the item on March 7, 2005. Over the course of a single day, this item attracted so much interest that Zamos immediately received requests for interviews from all over the United States and the United Kingdom. Microsoft quickly proposed a different settlement, and Zamos agreed. As part of this settlement, Zamos has agreed not to discuss the case further.

Zamos"},{"id":"2347624","text":"Shabari (IAST:Śabarī) () is an elderly woman ascetic in the Hindu epic Ramayana. She is described as an ardently devoted woman who received Rama's darshan and blessing due to her Bhakti to him.  Story  Shabari was a woman from a tribal village. According to Krishna Dutt, she was a seeker of knowledge and wanted to know the meaning of Dharma. After days of travel, she met Sage Matanga at the foot of Mount Rishyamukha. She accepted him as guru, serving him with devotion for many years. When Matanga was about to die, Shabari, now elderly, stated that after serving him throughout her life, she now sought to reach for herself the same \\"abode of peace\\" which Matanga had reached. The sage responded that, if she offered seva (service), Lord Rama would give her darshana. He told her to await Rama's arrival. Then, while sitting in lotus posture, the sage attained Mahasamadhi. Following her guru's advice, Shabari awaited Rama's arrival. Every day, Shabari would go out of her ashram, with the help of a walking stick, and pluck berries for Lord Rama. She would pluck one, taste it and, if it was sweet, she would put it in her basket, discarding the bitter ones. She wanted to give the good berries to Rama. She didn't know that offerings must not be tasted. Thus, collecting a few berries, Shabari would return to the ashram and eagerly await Lord Rama's arrival. Shabari is commonly used as a metaphor for an endless wait for God. =Shri Rama's Arrival= According to the scriptural account, even though hundreds of other yogis were waiting to receive Rama in their ashrams, Rama went only to Shabari's ashram because of her sincere devotion. On seeing Rama, Shabari became ecstatic and said, \\"There were so many exalted yogis waiting for your darshan, but you came to this unworthy devotee (...) This clearly shows that you will neither see whether a devotee lives in a palace or humble hut, whether he is erudite or ignorant (...) neither see caste nor color. You will only see the true bhakti (...) I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berries. May it please you, my Lord.\\" Shabari offered the fruits which she had meticulously collected. As Rama tasted them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and they were, therefore, unworthy of eating. To this, Rama responded that, of the many types of food he had tasted, \\"nothing could equal these berries, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake in it with great joy.\\" Traditional writers use this narrative to indicate that in bhakti, faults are not seen by the deities. Pleased with Shabari's devotion, Rama blesses her with his vision. Rama notices the donas, or bowls, of handmade leaves in which she had offered the fruits and is impressed by the hard work Shabari has gone through to make them and, hence, blesses the tree so that the leaves naturally grow in the shape of a bowl. Shabari also tells Rama to take help from Sugriva and where to find him. The Ramayana says that Shabari was a very bright and knowledgeable saint. = Rama's discourse = Rama delivers his discourse on nava-vidha bhakti (ninefold devotion) to Shabari, > Such pure devotion is expressed in nine ways. First is satsang or > association with love-intoxicated devotees and righteous people. The second > is to develop a taste for hearing My nectar-like stories. The third is > service to the guru (...) Fourth is to sing My kirtan (communal chorus) > (...) Japa or repetition of My Holy name and chanting My bhajans are the > fifth expression (...) To follow scriptural injunctions always, to practice > control of the senses, nobility of character and selfless service, these are > expressions of the sixth mode of bhakti. Seeing Me manifested everywhere in > this world and worshipping My saints more than myself is the seventh mode of > bhakti. To find no fault with anyone and to be contented with one's lot is > the eighth mode of bhakti. Unreserved surrender with total faith in My > strength is the ninth and highest stage. Shabari, anyone who practices one > of these nine modes of My bhakti pleases Me most and reaches Me without > fail. That which is most difficult for the greatest yogis was easily > attained by you, Shabari, because of your sincere devotion.

Its members are signatories to the following pledge: \\"War is a crime against humanity. I renounce war, and am therefore determined not to support any kind of war. I am also determined to work for the removal of all causes of war\\", and campaign to promote peaceful and nonviolent solutions to conflict. The PPU forms the British section of War Resisters' International. History =Formation= Peace Pledge Union poster The PPU emerged from an initiative by Hugh Richard Lawrie 'Dick' Sheppard, canon of St Paul's Cathedral, in 1934, after he had published a letter in the Manchester Guardian and other newspapers, inviting men (but not women) to send him postcards pledging never to support war.Andrew Rigby, \\"The Peace Pledge Union: From Peace to War, 1936–1945\\" in Peter Brock, Thomas Paul Socknat Challenge to Mars:Pacifism from 1918 to 1945. University of Toronto Press, 1999. (pp. 169–185) 135,000 men responded and, with co-ordination by Sheppard, the Methodist Reverend John C. B. Myer, and others, formally became members. The initial male-only aspect of the pledge was aimed at countering the idea that only women were involved in the peace movement. In 1936 membership was opened to women, and the newly founded Peace News was adopted as the PPU's weekly newspaper. The PPU assembled several noted public figures as sponsors, including Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Storm Jameson, Rose Macaulay, Donald Soper, Siegfried Sassoon, Reginald Sorensen, J. D. Beresford, Ursula Roberts (who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Susan Miles\\")Martin Ceadel, Pacifism in Britain, 1914–1945 : the defining of a faith Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980. (pp. 321–22) and Brigadier-General F. P. Crozier (a former army officer turned pacifist).Martin Ceadel, Semi-Detached Idealists:The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854–1945. Oxford University Press, 2000 (p. 334) The PPU attracted members across the political spectrum, including Christian pacifists, socialists, anarchists and in the words of member Derek Savage, \\"an amorphous mass of ordinary well-meaning but fluffy peace-lovers\\". In 1937 the No More War Movement formally merged with the PPU. George Lansbury, previously chair of the No More War Movement, became president of the PPU, holding the post until his death in 1940. In 1937 a group of clergy and laity led by Sheppard formed the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship as an Anglican complement to the non-sectarian PPU. The Union was associated with the Welsh group, Heddwchwyr Cymru, founded by Gwynfor Evans. In March 1938, PPU George Lansbury launched the PPU's first manifesto and peace campaign. The campaign argued that the idea of a war to defend democracy was a contradiction in terms and that \\"in a period of total war, democracy would be submerged under totalitarianism\\". A large part of the PPU's work involved providing for the victims of war. Its members sponsored a house where 64 Basque children, refugees from the Spanish Civil War, were cared for. PPU archivist William Hetherington writes that \\"The PPU also encouraged members and groups to sponsor individual Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to enable them to be received into the United Kingdom\\".William Hetherington, \\"Peace Pledge Union\\" in The World Encyclopedia of Peace. Edited by Linus Pauling, Ervin Laszlo, and Jong Youl Yoo. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. (p.243-7).Juliet Gardiner The Thirties: An Intimate History, Harper Press, 2010, p.501. In 1938 the PPU opposed legislation for air-raid precautions and in 1939 campaigned against military conscription. =Attitudes towards Nazi Germany= Like many in the 1930s, the PPU supported aspects of appeasement, with some members suggesting that Nazi Germany would cease its aggression if the territorial provisions of the Versailles Treaty were undone.David C. Lukowitz, \\"British Pacifists and Appeasement: The Peace Pledge Union\\", Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 9, No. 1, January 1974, pp. 115–127 It backed Neville Chamberlain's policy at Munich in 1938, regarding Hitler's claims on the Sudetenland as legitimate. At the time of the Munich crisis, several PPU sponsors tried to send \\"five thousand pacifists to the Sudetenland as a non- violent presence\\", however this attempt came to nothing. Peace News editor and PPU sponsor John Middleton Murry and his supporters in the group caused considerable controversy by arguing Germany should be given control of parts of mainland Europe. In a PPU publication, Warmongers, Clive Bell said that Germany should be permitted to \\"absorb\\" France, Poland, the Low Countries and the Balkans. However, this was never the official policy of the PPU and the position quickly drew criticism from other PPU activists such as Vera Brittain and Andrew Stewart.\\"Miss Brittain and others found objectionable Murry's advocacy of a \\"Pax Germanica\\" on the European continent\\" Quoted in Richard A. Rempel, \\"The Dilemmas of British Pacifists During World War II\\", The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 50, No. 4, Supplement, December, 1978, pp. D1213–D1229. Clive Bell left the PPU shortly afterwards and by 1940 he was supporting the war. Some PPU supporters were so sympathetic to German grievances that PPU supporter Rose Macaulay claimed she found it difficult to distinguish between the PPU newspaper Peace News and that of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), saying, \\"occasionally when reading Peace News, I (and others) half think we have got hold of the Blackshirt [BUF journal] by mistake\\".Julie V. Gottlieb, Feminine fascism: women in Britain's fascist movement, London: I.B.Tauris, 2003Frank McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, Manchester University Press, 1998 There was Fascist infiltration of the PPUJulie V. Gottlieb, Feminine fascism: women in Britain's fascist movement, London: I.B. Tauris, 2003 and MI5 kept an eye on the PPU's \\"small Fascist connections\\".F. H. Hinsley and C. A. G. Simpkins, British Intelligence in the Second World War (London: HMSO, 1990), p. 37 After Dick Sheppard's death in October 1937, George Orwell, always hostile to pacifism, accused the PPU of \\"moral collapse\\" on the grounds that some members even joined the BUF.Peter Brock and Thomas Paul Socknat, Challenge to Mars: essays on pacifism from 1918 to 1945, University of Toronto Press, 1999 (p. 141). However, several historians note that the situation may have been the other way around; that is, BUF members attempted to infiltrate the PPU. On 11 August 1939, the Deputy Editor of Peace News, Andrew Stewart, criticised those \\"who think that membership of British Union, Sir Oswald Moseley's Fascist organization, is compatible with membership of the PPU\\". In November 1939, an MI5 officer reported that members of the far-right Nordic League were attempting \\"to join the PPU en masse\\". Historians have differed in their interpretation of the PPU's attitude to Nazi Germany. The historian Mark Gilbert said, \\"it is hard to think of a British newspaper that was so consistent an apologist for Nazi Germany as Peace News,\\" which \\"assiduously echoed the Nazi press's claims that far worse offences than the Kristallnacht events were a regular feature of British colonial rule\\".Mark Gilbert, \\"Pacifist attitudes to Nazi Germany, 1936-45\\", Journal of Contemporary History, July 1992, Vol. 27, pp. 493–511 But David C. Lukowitz argues that, \\"it is nonsense to charge the PPU with pro-Nazi sentiments. From the outset it emphasised that its primary dedication was to world peace, to economic justice and racial equality,\\" but it had \\"too much sympathy for the German position, often the product of ignorance and superficial thinking\\". Research by the historian Richard Griffiths, published in 2017, suggests considerable division and controversy at the top of the PPU, with the editors of Peace News being generally more willing to play down the dangers of Nazi Germany than were many members of the PPU Executive. Controversy over the PPU's attitude towards Nazi Germany has continued ever since the war. In 1950, Rebecca West, in her book The Meaning of Treason, described the PPU as \\"that ambiguous organisation which in the name of peace was performing many actions certain to benefit Hitler\\". The publishers removed the phrase from subsequent editions of the book following representations by the PPU, but West refused to apologise. As recently as 2017, the right-wing commentator and retired colonel Richard Kemp alleged on Good Morning Britain that the PPU were \\"arch-appeasers\\" who had supported the absorption of the Low Countries into Germany's sphere of influence. This was denied by the PPU representative on the programme, who stated that the PPU had campaigned against arms sales to Fascist regimes when the UK government was selling weapons to Mussolini.Good Morning Britain, broadcast on ITV1 on 27 October 2017 =Second World War= Initially, the Peace Pledge Union opposed the Second World War and continued to argue for a negotiated peace with Germany. On 9 March 1940, 2,000 people attended a PPU public meeting calling for a negotiated peace. PPU membership reached a peak of 140,000 in 1940. For some members of the PPU, the focus was less on a negotiated peace and more on \\"nonviolent revolution\\" in both Britain and Germany. In 1940, the PPU published a booklet called Plan of Campaign, reprinting an article by the Dutch Christian anarcho-pacifist Bart de Ligt. He called for war to be made impossible by direct action, including \\"the most effective non-co-operation, boycott and sabotage\\". Not all PPU members were happy with this approach and the booklet was withdrawn from sale in London. In February 1940, the Daily Mail newspaper called for the PPU to be banned.\\"In a leading article the Daily Mail urges the Minister for Home Security (Sir John Anderson) to suppress the \\"near-treasonable work\\" of the Peace Pledge Union\\". \\"Peace Pledge Union National Menace\\".The Courier-Mail (Brisbane),24 February 1940, (p. 5) While the government decided not to ban the PPU, a number of PPU members faced arrest and prosecution for campaigning against war. In May 1940, six leading PPU activists—Alex Wood, Stuart Morris, Maurice Rowntree, John Barclay, Ronald Smith and Sidney Todd—were charged over the publication of a pacifist poster that was aimed at encouraging people of all nationalities to refuse to fight. The charge read out in court was that they \\"did endeavour to cause among persons in His Majesty's Service disaffection likely to lead to breaches of their duty\\". They were prosecuted by the Attorney-General, Donald Somervell KC. They were defended by John Platts-Mills and were convicted but not imprisoned. The PPU Council voted by a majority to withdraw the poster in question, although this seems to have been a controversial decision within the PPU. Other PPU members were also arrested, for holding open-air meetings during the war and selling Peace News in the street.Spartacus Schoolnet In 1942, PPU General Secretary Stuart Morris was sentenced to nine months in prison for dealing with secret government documents relating to British rule in India, which he was alleged to have been planning to pass to Gandhi or others in the nonviolent wing of the Indian independence movement. The trial was held in secret. The PPU Council disassociated itself from Morris' actions. The critical attitude towards the PPU in this period was summarised by George Orwell, writing in the October 1941 issue of Adelphi magazine: \\"Since pacifists have more freedom of action in countries where traces of democracy survive, pacifism can act more effectively against democracy than for it. Objectively, the pacifist is pro-Nazi\\". Following the fall of France, support for the PPU dropped considerably and some former members even volunteered for the armed forces. The PPU abandoned the focus on peace negotiations. PPU members instead concentrated on activities such as supporting British conscientious objectors and supporting the Food Relief Campaign. A few members of the PPU joined the Bruderhof in the Cotswolds, which was seen as a radical peace experiment. This latter campaign attempted to supply food, under Red Cross supervision, to civilians in occupied Europe. From 1941, the PPU campaigned against the bombing of German civilians and was one of several groups to back the Bombing Restriction Committee (most of whose members were not pacifists or even opposed to the war as a whole). The Birmingham branch of the PPU declared, \\"We pacifists, while determined to resist the Nazi system, believe that nothing can justify the continuation of this slaughter and the moral degradation that it involves\\". Throughout the war, Vera Brittain published a newsletter, Letters to Peace Lovers, criticizing the conduct of the war, including the bombing of civilian areas of Germany. This had 2,000 subscribers.Mark Abrams, The Population of Great Britain, Hughes Press, 2007 By 1945, membership of the PPU had fallen by more than a quarter, standing at 98,414 when the war ended (compared to around 140,000 in 1940). =After the Second World War= Since 1945, the PPU has consistently \\"condemned the violence, oppression and weapons of all belligerents\\". Immediately after the war, there was a focus on support for famine relief in Europe and elsewhere. The PPU condemned the use of nuclear weapons against Japan in August 1945 and in October 1945, prominent PPU members were among the signatories to an open letter asking what the moral difference was between mass killing by Nazis in concentration camps and mass killings by atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was followed by the publication of the PPU leaflet Atom War. In 1947, the PPU voted to make a priority of campaigning for the abolition of conscription (known in law as National Service). Conscription in the UK was phased out from 1960 and ended completely in 1963. In the 1950s, the PPU paid more attention to ideas of nonviolent civil disobedience, as developed by Mohandas Gandhi and others. This was not without controversy even within the PPU, with some members resigning as they objected to the use, or what they saw as the too frequent use, of methods of civil disobedience. However, members of PPU were well represented in the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War (DAC) founded in 1957, which organised the first of the Aldermaston marches in 1958. In practice, however, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the PPU lost some members to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, even though CND was not a pacifist-only organisation and, at least in its early days, was less focused on direct action. Some recovery in the PPU's fortunes took place after 1965, when Myrtle Solomon was general secretary. The PPU organised protests against the US war in Vietnam and handed out leaflets to US tourists in Britain stating \\"not only are Vietnamese being killed, but American men are dying for a cause war cannot achieve\\".\\"European Groups Grinding Out Protests Against Vietnam War\\", Spartanburg Herald-Journal, March 9, 1968, p. 19 The PPU also opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and condemned both the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands and the British response. It has also promoted the ideas of pacifist thinkers such as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Richard B. Gregg. The group had a branch in Northern Ireland, the Peace Pledge Union in Northern Ireland; in the 1970s this group campaigned for the withdrawal of the British army, as well as the disbandment of both Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groups.\\"Peace Pledge Union (PPU) in Northern Ireland\\", Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, ), p. 837 The Peace Pledge Union's 21st-century activity has included taking part in British protests against the 2003 Iraq War.\\"They will be coming from every part of Britain representing bodies as diverse as the Peace Pledge Union, Britons vs Bush and the Woodcraft Folk. There will be people from dozens of small, newly formed anti-war groups from towns, villages, churches and colleges, many of whom have never been on a protest before\\". Quoted in Terry Kirby, \\"Doves on the warpath: a million ordinary Britons prepare to demonstrate for peace\\" The Independent (UK). 13 February 2003. Retrieved 24 June 2011. In 2005, the PPU released an educational CD-ROM on Martin Luther King's life and work that was adopted by several British schools.Elizabeth Peirce, Activity Assemblies To Promote Peace:40+ Ideas for Multi-Faith Assemblies For 5-11 Years (Taylor and Francis, 2008, ), p. 72 In recent years, the PPU has focused on issues including Remembrance Day, peace education, the commemoration of World War One and what they describe as the \\"militarisation\\" of British society. White poppy campaign A Peace poppy wreath, made of Peace poppies, with a CND symbol inside at a British Remembrance Day event The PPU's most visible contemporary activity is the White Poppy appeal, started in 1933 by the Women's Co- operative Guild alongside the Royal British Legion's red poppy appeal.White Poppies for Peace The white poppy commemorated not only British soldiers killed in war, but also civilian victims on all sides, standing as \\"a pledge to peace that war must not happen again\\".PPU: 100 years of action to peace, 1930-39 In 1986, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed her \\"deep distaste\\" for the white poppies,Margaret Thatcher Foundation on allegations that they potentially diverted donations from service men, yet this stance gave them increased publicity. In the 2010s, sales of white poppies rose. The PPU reported that around 110,000 white poppies had been bought in 2015, the highest number on record. Notable members Members of the PPU have included: Vera Brittain, Benjamin Britten, Clifford Curzon, Alex Comfort, Eric Gill, Ben Greene, Laurence Housman, Aldous Huxley, George Lansbury, Kathleen Lonsdale, Reginald Sorensen, George MacLeod, Sybil Morrison, John Middleton Murry, Peter Pears, Max Plowman, Arthur Ponsonby, Bertrand Russell, Siegfried Sassoon, Myrtle Solomon, Donald Soper, Sybil Thorndike, Michael Tippett and Wilfred Wellock.

In previous years, the team was known as Brioches La Boulangère, Bonjour, Bouygues Télécom, and Bbox Bouygues Telecom and Europcar. The 2015 season was the last under the sponsorship of Europcar; the team has been sponsored by Direct Énergie since 2016. Beginnings The team was founded in 1984 as Système U. The team disbanded in 1985 but returned in 1986 under new management. Cyrille Guimard became the directeur sportif, bringing his protégé Laurent Fignon. A change of sponsor in 1990 renamed the team Castorama. In 1992 Guimard became manager of the team. In 1995, Jean-René Bernaudeau, a former professional racer, became director of the team. From 1996 to 1999, the team withdrew from top-level competition. Bernaudeau set up a development team in the Vendée region called Vendée U. History Thomas Voeckler time-trialing in the previous Bouygues Télécom uniform In 2000, the team again became a professional team Bonjour, still under the control of the sporting director Bernaudeau. In 2003, the team became \\"Brioches La Boulangère\\", then \\"Bouygues Télécom\\" in 2005. The amateur team Vendée U still acts as feeder team for the professional team. As Bonjour and Brioches La Boulangère the team gained prominence with promising young stars Fabrice Salanson, Thomas Voeckler and Sylvain Chavanel. Salanson's death due to heart disease in 2003 was a blow to the team. Voeckler wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for 10 days in the 2004 Tour de France while also French national champion and became a national hero. The team competes mainly in French races. Chavanel left the team in 2005 to join Cofidis. On 29 September 2009 Bbox Bouygues Telecom along with Cofidis were not allowed to renew their ProTour licenses due to poor results. =2010–2011= 2011 Europcar team support vehicle convoy In their first season post-relegation, the team made showings at some grand tours, winning several stages and holding various classification jerseys. They had particular success in the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France. However sponsorship questions and unmet desires to rejoin the top tier, continued to dog the team. In late 2010, following a lengthy struggle to secure a sponsor for the 2011 season, Europcar was confirmed as the replacement, after assurances that then- French National Champion Thomas Voeckler would remain with the team, but the guarantee of the team's future, so late that it necessitated an extension of the usual UCI deadline for licence application, was too late to retain the services of Pierrick Fédrigo and Nicolas Vogondy. Voeckler's contract is worth over 400,000 euros a year, second only to Sylvain Chavanel among French riders, although he had been offered nearly twice as much to leave Bernadeau's team and join Cofidis for the 2011 season. Following these sponsorship questions, the team had its best year to date in 2011, winning stages in Paris–Nice and the Criterium du Dauphine (in which they also took the team competition). In July, Thomas Voeckler won and held the overall lead in the Tour of France for 10 days; support rider Pierre Rolland received accolades for his defense of Voeckler, and later took a stage victory on the famous Alpe D'Huez climb, leading to the race's overall white jersey title. The team also fielded Yohann Gène, the first black rider in the Tour. Europcar hoped that its new higher profile will allow it compete internationally in 2012 and sign more notable riders. =2012 season= Team Europcar failed to achieve World Tour status for the second year. Nevertheless, the team showed strong early-season form, taking second at the renowned Paris-Roubaix with Sébastien Turgot, and then winning the next classic on the schedule, as Thomas Voeckler rode solo to victory for 30 kilometers at the Brabantse Pijl. Following that result, the team continued their spring success with top-five showings from Voeckler in both Ardennes Week classics, the Amstel Gold and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The squad sent to Gabon also enjoyed stage victories in late April from both Géne and Voeckler, while Anthony Charteau won the overall lead for the third year running; and in Europe team sprinter Matteo Pelucchi took a stage in Dunkerque at the beginning of May. In April the team received a wildcard invitation to the Tour de France, along with three other French-registered teams. In the Tour, Europcar rider Voeckler won stages 10 and 16 and the King of the Mountains jersey, and Pierre Rolland won stage 11. =2013 season= Although negotiations with lead sponsor Europcar to extend their sponsorship beyond the end of the season have so far been unsuccessful, the team began their season with strong showings in some early races, seeing Yohann Gène taking a stage as well as winning the overall classification at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo, the team's fourth successive overall victory in Gabon. The team later took three successive stage wins at the Étoile de Bessèges, with Bryan Coquard winning the second and fourth stages, and Jérôme Cousin winning the third stage. Coquard took two wins at the Tour de Langkawi, winning stages eight and nine. In the team's first World Tour appearance of the season, at Paris–Nice, Damien Gaudin achieved a victory in the race-opening prologue. Gaudin won the Cholet- Pays de Loire single-day race, later in March, while Anthony Charteau won the fourth stage of the Tour de Normandie. In April, Pierre Rolland won the penultimate stage of the Circuit de la Sarthe, en route to winning the race overall. Cyril Gautier won the Tour du Finistère from an eight-rider breakaway move, while Natnael Berhane won the queen stage of the Tour of Turkey, finishing the race second overall the first place on the General Classification was awarded to Berhane after an anti-doping rule violation. Coquard's good performances saw him take the lead of the UCI Europe Tour, and continued his form into may, winning the second stage of the Tour de Picardie. In June, David Veilleux soloed to an opening stage victory at the Critérium du Dauphiné, while Thomas Voeckler also won a stage at the race. Gène won the second stage of the Route du Sud, and Voeckler took the queen stage of the race the following day, going on to win the race overall.

Background Vaca de Castro's parents were Garci Diez de Castro and Guiomar Cabeza de Vaca. He studied law in Salamanca. He married María Magdalena de Quiñones y Osorio, and had eight children with her. In 1536 he was named oidor (judge) in the Royal Audiencia of Valladolid. On September 9, 1540 he was named a knight of the Order of Santiago. The road to Peru Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, by Evaristo San Cristóval, 1891 In 1540 he was sent by Emperor Charles V to restore order between the factions of Gonzalo Pizarro and Diego Almagro the Younger after the assassination of Diego de Almagro the Elder. Vaca de Castro had a reputation as a man of integrity, sagacity, and courage. His official title was juez pesquisidor (special investigator). He was authorized to take over the government of the colony in the event of the death of Francisco Pizarro. He sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda on November 5, 1540, and arrived in Panama in January 1541. While he was there, he reformed the Audiencia, as its president. He sailed for Peru, but was forced by bad weather to land at Buenaventura (Colombia). He proceeded from Buenaventura by land to Cali, where he remained three months because of illness. While in Cali, he mediated in a jurisdictional dispute between Sebastián de Belalcázar and Pascual de Andagoya. As governor of Peru Still on the road to Peru, in Popayán he learned of the assassination of Francisco Pizarro and the election of Diego de Almagro as governor. He arrived in Quito on September 25, 1541, where he united the royalist forces behind him. Having made himself governor of the colony, he raised a considerable number of troops. Supported by Francisco de Carvajal, he defeated Almagro on September 16, 1542 in the plains of Chupas. Almagro tried to flee after the defeat, but was taken prisoner. Pressured by the Pizarristas, Vaca de Castro ordered his execution. The New Laws were passed in 1542. They were intended to ban the most obvious abuses of the encomienda system, and eventually abolish the system altogether. The New Laws caused difficulty for Vaca de Castro with Gonzalo Pizarro and other supporters of the old system. Vaca de Castro agreed to present their case to the Crown. Thereafter he concentrated his efforts on developing the country, through improving the means of communication, regulating the inns for cross-country travel, and overseeing the use of labor in the mines. In 1543 he sent Diego de Rojas and 200 men to the Río de la Plata. The discovery of Tucumán is credited to this expedition. Return to Spain He was succeeded by the first viceroy of Peru, Blasco Núñez Vela, in 1544. Núñez Vela had him arrested on charges of sympathizing with the rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro. He was imprisoned in El Callao, then sent by ship to Panama, and then on to Spain. In Spain, he was imprisoned on charges of illegal enrichment, but after three years in prison he was cleared of the charges. Later he was named commander of the Order of Santiago. He was president of the Council of Castile between 1557 and 1561. He retired to the convent of San Agustín in Valladolid, where he died in 1566. He was interred in the convent.

Background and early life Henry Dresser was born in Thirsk, Yorkshire, where his father was the manager of the bank set up by his grandfather. Dresser's father left Thirsk in 1840–41 to become a bank manager in Leeds before moving south to set up business as a commission merchant in the Baltic timber business in London in 1846. Henry Dresser senior was in business with his father-in-law, Robert Garbutt of Hull, who traded with Hackman and Co of Vyborg (Viipuri) in southern Finland. Henry Dresser senior purchased a large timber sawmill business, the Lancaster Mills, near Musquash in New Brunswick in 1848. Henry Eeles Dresser was the eldest son of Henry Dresser and Eliza Ann Garbutt; he had five sisters and three brothers. His father intended him to take over the family business in the Baltic timber trade so took him out of school in Bromley and sent him to Ahrensburg in 1852, to learn German and in 1854, to Gefle and Uppsala to study Swedish. Henry Dresser spent a time in Hackman's offices in Vyborg learning Finnish during 1856–58, during which time he travelled round the Baltic coast. Dresser had a lifelong interest in birds and collected bird skins and eggs from his early teenage years. Whilst he was in Finland in 1858 he discovered breeding waxwings and was the first Englishman to collect their eggs; this brought him fame amongst English ornithologists, most of whom were egg and skin collectors. Travels Through the 1860s, Dresser travelled widely through Europe and was twice in New Brunswick at his father's sawmill. He sought out ornithologists with whom he could exchange birds and eggs. In 1863, during the American Civil War, he travelled to Texas via the Rio Grande on behalf of Liverpool and Manchester businessmen, taking a cargo of blankets, quinine and other goods in short supply to be sold and purchased raw cotton with the proceeds. During his time in Texas from June 1863 to July 1864 Dresser made a collection of around 400 bird skins from southern Texas. His notes from his time in Texas, published in The Ibis (1865–66) are a leading source of information for the period and include mention of several interesting birds including the extinct (or almost extinct) ivory-billed woodpecker, the almost extinct Eskimo curlew and the endangered whooping crane. Contributions to ornithology Dresser was a leading figure in ornithological circles: he was elected a Member of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1865 and served as its secretary from 1882 to 1888. He was a member and fellow of the Linnean and Zoological societies of London and an honorary fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. He was a close friend of Professor Alfred Newton, Thomas Littleton Powys, 4th Baron Lilford and Alfred Russel Wallace and he knew all the leading ornithologists of his day. He was particularly well known to European, American and Russian ornithologists. He worked with Newton on the development of a close time for British birds when they could not be hunted during the 1860s and 70s, an early part of the development of the bird conservation movement. He was heavily involved with the early Society for the Protection of Birds (which developed to become the RSPB). In spite of his prominence as an ornithologist, this activity came second to his business which, from 1870 until 1910, was in the iron business, with premises at 110 Cannon Street in London. Dresser was the author of more than 100 scientific papers on birds, mostly concerned with geographical distribution, descriptions of new species and illustrated the eggs of many species for the first time. His Manual of Palaearctic Birds (1902) was an important contribution to the delimitation of the ranges of Palaearctic birds. Dresser produced some of the last folio works on birds, notably A History of the Birds of Europe (1871–1881, supplement issued in 1895–96), begun with Richard Bowdler Sharpe. This was complemented by The Eggs of the Birds of Europe (issued 1905–1910) and monographs on bee-eaters (1884–86) and rollers (1893). These were based upon examination of the leading collections of the day, most notably his own. While producing the 'History', Dresser and some other leading ornithologists, including Lord Lilford, rented rooms at Tenterden Street in London to be close to the library of the Zoological Society of London in Hanover Square. Dresser had privileged access to the notes of many of the most prominent ornithologists, such as Russian Sergei Buturlin, who discovered the main breeding grounds of Ross's gull in 1905 in the delta of the Kolyma River in remote north-east Siberia. Dresser left England to live in Cannes for the benefit of his health; he died in Monte Carlo on 28 November 1915. His collection of birds had been in the Manchester Museum, part of The University of Manchester, since 1899 and was purchased for the museum by John Thomasson (a Bolton businessman). Dresser's egg collection was acquired by the museum in 1912. The museum also contains some of Dresser's correspondence and diaries. Selected publications * Issued in 84 parts.

The Deanery Tower in Hadleigh, Suffolk, early Henry VIII Compton Wynyates, begun 1491, at the start of the period. Determinedly asymmetrical and set low in the landscape The Tudor architectural style is the final development of Medieval architecture in England, during the Tudor period (1485-1603) and even beyond, and also the tentative introduction of Renaissance architecture to England. It followed the Late Gothic Perpendicular style and, gradually, it evolved into an aesthetic more consistent with trends already in motion on the continent, evidenced by other nations already having the Northern Renaissance underway and Italy already well into its revolution in art, architecture, and thought. A subtype of Tudor architecture includes Elizabethan architecture from about 1560 to 1600. In the much more slow-moving styles of vernacular architecture, \\"Tudor\\" has become a designation for half- timbered buildings, although the truth is there are cruck and frame houses with half timbering that predate 1485 by quite a bit and the style bleeds early into the Jacobean era and a closer examination is required to determine the edifice's age. In this form the Tudor style long retained its hold on English taste. Nevertheless, 'Tudor style' is an awkward style-designation, with its implied suggestions of continuity through the period of the Tudor dynasty and the misleading impression that there was a style break at the accession of James I in 1603, first of the House of Stuart. The low Tudor arch was a defining feature. Some of the most remarkable oriel windows belong to this period. Mouldings are more spread out and the foliage becomes more naturalistic. During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, many Italian artists arrived in England; their decorative features can be seen at Hampton Court Palace, Layer Marney Tower, Sutton Place, and elsewhere. However, in the following reign of Elizabeth I, the influence of Northern Mannerism, mainly derived from books, was greater. Courtiers and other wealthy Elizabethans competed to build prodigy houses that proclaimed their status. The Dissolution of the Monasteries redistributed large amounts of land to the wealthy, resulting in a secular building boom, as well as a source of stone. The building of churches had already slowed somewhat before the English Reformation, after a great boom in the previous century, but was brought to a nearly complete stop by the Reformation. Civic and university buildings became steadily more numerous in the period, which saw general increasing prosperity. Brick was something of an exotic and expensive rarity at the beginning of the period, but during it became very widely used in many parts of England, even for modest buildings, gradually restricting traditional methods such as wood framed daub and wattle and half-timbering to the lower classes by the end of the period. Scotland was a different country throughout the period, and is not covered here, but early Renaissance architecture in Scotland was influenced by close contacts between the French and Scottish courts, and there are a number of buildings from before 1560 that show a more thorough adoption of continental Renaissance styles than their English equivalents. Typical features Gatehouse of Oxburgh Hall in Oxborough Tudor style buildings have several features that separate them from Medieval and later 17th-century design. The earliest signs of the Renaissance appear under Henry VII; whereas most of his building projects are no longer standing, it is actually under him and not his son that the Renaissance began to flower in England, evidenced by ample records of what was built and where, materials used, new features in gardening that did not at all fit the pattern of the earlier medieval walled garden, letters from the king expressing his desires and those of his wife's in the case of Greenwich Palace, as well as his own expressed interest in the New Learning. =Nobility, upper classes, and clerical= The Early Years: Henry Tudor And The Seeds of The Renaissance Take Root Prior to 1485, many wealthy and noble landowners lived in homes that were not necessarily comfortable but built to withstand sieges, though manor houses that were only lightly fortified, if at all, had been increasingly built. Castles and smaller manor houses often had moats, portcullises and crenelations designed for archers to stand guard and pick off approaching enemies. However, with the arrival of gunpowder and cannons by the time of Henry VI, fortifications like castles became increasingly obsolete. 1485 marked the ascension of the Tudor Henry VII to the throne and the end of the Wars of the Roses that had left the royal coffers in deep trouble-Yorkists had raided the treasury just after the death of Edward IV. In 1487 Henry passed laws against livery and maintenance, which checked the nobility's ability to raise armies independent of the crown, and raised taxes on the nobility through a trusted advisor, John Morton. Henry Tudor was hellbent on repairing the damage done by so many years of war, and that meant increasing financial security. It also meant recentralising power in London with the crown alone and away from interrelated nobles who had been squabbling over scraps of power since the reign of Richard II, evidenced by the crown beginning to be fought over by different branches of the descendants of Edward III at that time. This move was particularly unpopular and ensured that the king, above all others, was the most powerful and wealthy noble in England rather than well landed lords, and thus the example to follow. Henry VII was not above giving out bills of attainder to disobedient or faithless nobles who refused to bend the knee to him as king, which incidentally also often meant their lands or titles would revert to the crown. 250x250pxDuring the reign of Henry VII, he made some savvy business investments in the alum trade and made vast improvements to the waterborne infrastructure of the country: the site of his dry dock in Portsmouth still is used today, and equally because of Henry's investments in alum (a mordant used for dying wool, a major export of England at the time) records also show a striking increase in the volume of ships and thus trade coming in and out of England.Arthur Nelson, The Tudor navy: the ships, men and organisation, 1485–1603 (2001) Portsmouth was an early pet project of Henry VII, one he paid approximately £193 for the entire construction, a sum that for its time was enormous. It must be noted that not all Tudor architecture was of a residential nature, and this particular one is very important as it laid the foundation for other civic projects done under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. Henry Tudor built the very first dry dock in the world at this site. It was a big leap forward from what was available during the Medieval period: for most of the period ships were poorly suited to trade that reached any farther than just off the coast and were no match for the turbulence of waters like the North Sea let alone crossing the Atlantic. Within three years of Henry Tudor's ascension to the throne, however, Bartolomeu Dias had rounded the future tip of today's South Africa and by doing so would change the world forever: he opened up a sea passage to Asia and opened a route that completely cut out the reliance on the Silk Road and the Turks who controlled it. Ships were beginning to get faster and more capable of much longer journeys. Patronage of explorers would be a theme of the rest of Henry's adulthood, and it behooved him to take advantage of having the only place in all of Europe that could repair ships, build new ones, remove barnacles and shipworms, and break up and recycle older ships. Purchasing eight acres, he handed off the job of constructing it to a trusted councillor Sir Reginald Bray with the final construction, according to a 17th- century tome. It measured 330 feet on each side, the bottom of the dock 395 feet long, and the whole 22 feet deep. The wharf on the outside of the piers that marked the dock's location were 40 feet on each side at a depth of 22 feet. Henry VII and the dock operated by swinging some hinged gates open, allowing the ship to enter, and then water was taken out with a bucket and chain pump worked by a horse-gin. In the early part of his reign, Henry Tudor favored two sites, both on the River Thames though in opposite directions, with one west of Westminster and one east of it. Upon his rise to power he inherited many castles, but notably he did very little to these. Recent evidence suggests that he made notable improvements to other properties belonging to the crown, including Greenwich Palace, also known as the Palace of Placentia. Although today the Old Royal Naval College sits on the site of the palace, evidence suggests that, shortly after ascending the throne, Henry spent a very large amount of money on enlarging it and finishing off a watchtower built prior to his reign; his Queen, Elizabeth, gave birth to Henry VIII and his brother Edmund in this palace. Henry Tudor's palace facing the Thames Estuary would have had a massive brick courtyard that faced the River Thames and commanded a view of the ships passing by. As of 2018 archaeological digs continue and much has been discovered regarding the kind of palace Henry (and later his son) invested so much money and time into. For example, recent archaeology suggests that Greenwich had \\"bee boles\\": these were found in the basement of the palace and were little nooks in which beehives were kept during winter when honeybees hibernate. They would be taken out to provide for the king's table in spring and they are numerous, suggesting the desire for grand amounts of entertaining. Surprisingly, much of the remains beneath the royal college reveal an edifice built with brick, not stone: castles in England going back to the Normans had been built with stone, never brick, hence this is an early advancement in technology and style and given its load bearing position at the bottom of the building it is extremely unlikely to have been erected under the aegis of any later monarch. It is also believed he added a sizeable chapel to the grounds with black and white tiles, discovered in 2006.Antony Wyngaerde in 1562 Sheen, was someway down river from (and in the present day part of) London and became a primary residence as Henry's family and court grew larger. This had been one of the royal palaces since the reign of Edward II, with the most recent additions as at 1496 being by Henry V in 1414. The building was largely wooden with cloisters and several medieval features, such as a grand central banqueting hall, and the Privy Chambers facing the river very much resembling a 15th-century castle. This burnt to the ground at Christmas 1497, with the royal family in residence; accounts of it made by a foreign ambassador to the court describe a catastrophe so big in magnitude that it nearly killed the king himself. However, within months Henry began a magnificent new palace in a version of Renaissance style. This, called Richmond Palace and now lost save for some fragments, has been described as the first prodigy house, a term for the ostentatious mansions of Elizabeth's courtiers and others, and was influential on other great houses for decades to come as well as a seat of royal power and pageantry of an equivalent of modern-day Buckingham Palace or the 18th century St. James's Palace. Henry VIII and later Georg Hoefnagel's 1568 watercolour of the south front of Nonsuch Palace. This is the way it would have looked early in the reign of Elizabeth I. Little Moreton Hall, built in stages between 1504–1562 Henry VII was succeeded by his second son, Henry VIII, a man of a very different character of his father, who spent enormous amounts of money on building many palaces, most now vanished, as well as other expensive forms of display. In a courtyard of Hampton Court Palace he installed a fountain that for celebrations flowed with wine. He also built military installations all along the southern coast of England and the border with Scotland, then a separate nation. Henry VIII's most ambitious palace was Nonsuch Palace, south of London and now disappeared, an attempt to rival the spectacular French royal palaces of the age and, like them, using imported Italian artists, though the architecture is northern European in inspiration. Much of the Tudor palace survives at Hampton Court Palace, which Henry took over from his disgraced minister Cardinal Wolsey and expanded, and this is now the surviving Tudor royal palace that best shows the style. As time wore on, quadrangular, 'H' or 'E' shaped floor plans became more common, with the H shape coming to fruition during the reign of Henry VII's son and successor. It was also fashionable for these larger buildings to incorporate 'devices', or riddles, designed into the building, which served to demonstrate the owner's wit and to delight visitors. Occasionally these were Catholic symbols, for example, subtle or not so subtle references to the trinity, seen in three-sided, triangular, or 'Y' shaped plans, designs or motifs. Earlier clerical buildings would have had a cross shape so as to honour Christ, such as in Old St Paul's and the surviving York Cathedral, but as with all clerical buildings, this was a time of great upheaval catalyzed by Henry VIII's Reformation. A part of his policy was the suppression of the monasteries and several examples of the Middle Ages today lie in ruins because of the nobility raiding the properties for building materials, gold, and anything of monetary value: for many the only way to escape being destroyed was the monarch holding a personal interest in keeping the abbey or cathedral intact (Westminster Abbey being an excellent example.). One of the most famous examples of this lies in East Anglia, near the village of Walsingham. Predating the Norman Conquest, this area of the present day United Kingdom was a major site of pilgrimage dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ. Over the centuries an Augustinian priory was erected upon the site that grew wealthy from pilgrims' donations and for its era this one of the most popular shrines in all of England: Monarchs from Henry III- Henry VII had worshipped at the place by 1510, and even men as famous as Erasmus visited. During Henry VIII's Reformation, however, the records show that the monks at Walsingham were turned out into the streets, the priory chapel was desecrated, and the gold and silver ornamentations of the architecture were looted. The statue of Our Lady of Walsingham at the center of the shrine was brought back to London as a trophy to be destroyed, and the property itself was turned over to a man in the king's favour whereafter it was mined for its stone. The great majority of images, and elements of church furniture disapproved of by the Protestants, were destroyed in waves under Henry VIII, Edward VI, and later during the English Commonwealth. For example, during the reign of Edward VI parishioners witnessed a royal decree ripping out the rood screen in every single church: none of these now survive and in addition many altarpieces were burned. While Henry VIII was still alive, many statues and shrine objects were smashed or burnt: they were considered \\"abused images\\" and a form of idolatry by many aligning with the king. Building of new churches became much less frequent, and as a result England actually has larger numbers of medieval churches whose main fabric has survived than most parts of Europe. Tragically, however, larger buildings like Jervaulx or Fountains, buildings whose wealth and grandeur were meant to rival Notre-Dame de Paris often do not even have their stained glass windows and are a shadow of their former selves. Henry and Edward are responsible for enormous losses and gaps in the cultural record; the damage was massive. Manuscripts, many of them illuminated, were lost, with many being burned. Some of these went back to the time of the Anglo-Saxons, but as few could read the runic alphabet (including the king himself) they were destroyed and their intricate covers, sometimes bejeweled, were looted. Distinctly English styles of craftsmanship in religious metalwork for chalices, bishops' croziers, patens, and cruets were melted down for the crown. During this period, the arrival of the chimney stack and enclosed hearths resulted in the decline of the great hall based around an open hearth that was typical of earlier Medieval architecture. Instead, fireplaces could now be placed upstairs and it became possible to have a second story that ran the whole length of the house. Tudor chimney- pieces were made large and elaborate to draw attention to the owner's adoption of this new technology. The jetty appeared, as a way to show off the modernity of having a complete, full-length upper floor. Decorative Tudor brick chimneys at Hampton Court Palace Buildings constructed by the wealthy or royal had these common characteristics: *An 'E' or 'H' shaped floor plan * Brick and stone masonry, sometimes with half timbers on upper floors in grand houses earlier in the period *Recycling of older medieval stone, especially after Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. Some reuse of monetary buildings as houses. *Curvilinear gables, an influence taken from Dutch designs, from the mid-century *Large displays of glass in very large windows several feet long; glass was expensive so only the rich could afford numerous large windows *Depressed arches in clerical and aristocratic design, especially in the early-middle portion of the period *Hammerbeam roofs still in use for great halls from Medieval period under Henry VII until 1603; were built more decoratively, often with geometric-patterned beams and corbels carved into beasts *Most windows, except large ones, are rectangular, and drip moulds common above them. *Classical accents such as round-headed arches over doors and alcoves, plus prominent balustrades from time of Henry VIII to Elizabeth I * Large brick chimneys, often topped with narrow decorative chimney pots in the homes of the upper middle class and higher. Ordinary medieval village houses were often made much more pleasant to live in by the addition of brick fireplaces and chimneys, replacing an open hearth. * Wide, enormous stone fireplaces with very large hearths meant to accommodate larger scale entertaining; in aristocratic homes the formal rooms may have large chimneypieces in stone, sometimes with the family's heraldry. *Enormous ironwork for spit roasting located inside cooking fireplaces. In the homes of the upper class and nobility it was fashionable to show off wealth by being able to roast all manner of beasts weighing less than 500 grams on up to a full grown bull; in the case of royalty it would be seen as dishonor if the monarch's table could not provide equal to that of the Continental powers of France and Spain. Managing the flames would be the job of either a spit boy (Henry VII's reign) or later on a new invention where a turnspit dog ran on a treadmill (Elizabeth I's reign.) *Long galleries *Tapestries serving a triple purpose of keeping out chill, decorating the interior, and displaying wealth. In the wealthiest homes these may contain gold or silver thread. *Gilt detailing inside and outside the home *Geometric landscaping in the back of the home: large gardens and enclosed courtyards were a feature of the very wealthy. Fountains begin to appear in the reign of Henry VIII. *Arms- The Tudor dynasty is famous for using its Tudor rose as a decorative device, but also the royal coat of arms was in use throughout the period as a p.r. and marketing tool and today is an important marker that dates a structure, singles it out from any other coat of arms, and if authentic can prove its provenance: it would have been a feature of the furniture as well as ironwork. Very specific to royalty, the royal coat of arms of the House of Tudor would have been distinct from all others that have sat the throne: in common with most royal houses, the three lions passant and the fleur de lys pattern did impale the shield, with the motto of \\"God and my right.\\" In common with all arms since Edward III, they all have the gold lion passant guardant standing upon a chapeau, bearing a royal crown on its head. However, this period had specifically the Greyhound Argent collared Gules plus a matching red dragon gules sinister garnished and armed Or, a nod to the Welsh origins of the House of Tudor and Henry VII's claim to be the heir of Cadwaldr. For Henry VII, the dragon occasionally would have been replaced with a lion rampant and had red mantling lined with ermine; this distinguishes it from his son, Henry VIII, who lined his with gold. Mary I had the black eagle rampant sinister as a supporter, a nod to her marriage to Philip II of Spain. =Commoner classes= Anne Hathaway's Cottage, a timber-framed farmhouse The houses and buildings of ordinary people were typically timber framed. Timber framing on the upper floors of a house started appearing after 1400 CE in Europe and originally it was a method used to keep water from going back into the walls, instead being redirected back to the soil. The frame was usually filled with wattle and daub but occasionally with brick. These houses were also slower to adopt the latest trends, and the great hall continued to prevail. Fireplaces were quite large by modern standards, and intended to heat as much of the home as possible as well as cook upon them because in this period England was much more prone to snow. Smaller Tudor-style houses display the following characteristics: *Simpler square or rectangular floor plans in market towns or cities *Farmhouses retain a small fat 'H' shape and traces of late Medieval architecture; modification was less expensive than entirely rebuilding. *Steeply pitched roof, with thatching or tiles of slate or more rarely clay (London did not ban thatched roofs within the city until the 1660s) *Cruck framing in use throughout the period *Hammerbeam roofs retained for sake of utility (remained common in barns) *Prominent cross gables *Tall, narrow doors and windows *Small diamond-shaped window panes, typically with lead casings to hold them together *Dormer windows, late in the period *Flagstone or dirt floors rather than all stone and wood *Half-timbers made of oak, with wattle and daub walls painted white *Brickwork in homes of gentry, especially Elizabethan. As with upper classes, conformed to a set size of × × , bonded by mortar with a high lime content *Jettied top floor to increase interior space; This was very common in market town high streets and larger cities like London. *Extremely narrow to nonexistent space between buildings in towns *Inglenook fireplaces. Open floor fireplaces were a feature during the time of Henry VII but had declined in use by the 1560s for all but the poor as the growing middle classes were becoming more able to build them into their homes. Fireplace would be approximately wide × tall × at least deep. The largest fireplace – in the kitchen – had a hook nailed into the wall for hanging a cooking cauldron rather than the tripod of an open plan. Many chimneys were coated with lime or plaster inside to the misfortune of the owner: when heated these would decompose and thus the very first fire codes were implemented during the reign of Elizabeth I, as many lost their homes because of faulty installation. *Oven not separated from apparatus used in fireplace, especially after the reign of Edward VI; middle-class homes had no use for such enormous ovens nor money to build them. *More emphasis on wooden staircases in homes of the middle class and gentry *Outhouses in the back of the home, especially beyond cities in market towns, often referred to as \\"the jakes\\" in documents that survive. Flushable toilets were centuries away for the middle classes and in some less common cases they would not move indoors completely until the second half of the 20th century. *Little landscaping behind the home, but rather small herb gardens. Occasionally bee skeps would be kept in this area as a means of getting wax for candles and also, when in season, honey. *The poorest classes lived in hovels, a building with a slightly different definition than today: it was a one-room wattle-and-daub hut. Most did not have the copyhold on the land they occupied and were tenants on another man's land; amenities were very basic in that there was a place to sleep, a place to eat, and a place to cook. Examples =Church= In church architecture the principal examples, all still essentially Perpendicular Gothic, are: *The final stages of King's College Chapel, Cambridge (1446–1515) *St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle (1475–1528) *Henry VII Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey (1503–1509) *The chapel at Hampton Court Palace =College= Tudor architecture remained popular for conservative college patrons, even after it had been replaced in domestic building. Portions of the additions to the various colleges of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge were still carried out in the Tudor style until the middle of the 18th century, overlapping with the first stirrings of the Gothic Revival. There are also examples of Tudor architecture in Scotland, such as King's College, Aberdeen. =Domestic= Historic Tudor houses along Mill Street in Warwick Entrance facade of Sutton Place, Surrey, dating from around 1525 *Anne Hathaway's Cottage, Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire: typical 16th-century farmhouse; contains many original features of the house as it would have been in the 1580s. *Athelhampton House, Dorchester, Dorset - early Tudor *The Barbican, Devon, Plymouth *Bishop Percy House, Bridgnorth, Shropshire *Burghley House, Stamford, Lincolnshire *Castle Lodge, Ludlow, Shropshire *Charlecote Park, Warwickshire *Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire *Conquest House, Canterbury, Kent *East Barsham Manor, Norfolk *Eastbury Manor House, London *Eltham Palace, Greenwich, London *Ford's Hospital, Coventry *The Guildhall in Thaxted, Essex *Hampton Court Palace, London *Hengrave Hall, Suffolk, 1525–1538 *Henley Street, Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire-historic district of the entire town, includes the birthplace of William Shakespeare, a large Tudor edifice constructed c. 1570s. *Hunsdon House, Hertfordshire *Kenilworth Castle, Kenilworth, Warwickshire – retains many elements from Robert Dudley's 1570s design *Layer Marney Tower, Essex *Mill Street, Warwick, Warwickshire *Mapledurham House, Mapledurham, Oxfordshire *Montacute House, Somerset – late Tudor *Nonsuch Palace – perhaps the grandest of Henry VIII's building projects *Old Market Hall, Shrewsbury *Owlpen Manor, Gloucestershire *Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk *Prysten House, Plymouth, Devon c. 1490 *Gatehouse of Richmond Palace, London – early Tudor *Rainthorpe Hall, Tasburgh, Norfolk *Shaw House, Newbury, Berkshire *Sir Thomas Herbert's House, Pavement, York *Southover Grange, Lewes, East Sussex - c. 1572 *Speke Hall, Liverpool *St Bartholomew-the-Great Gatehouse, Smithfield, London *Sutton House, London Borough of Hackney *Sutton Place, Surrey – c. 1525 *Tudor Barn Eltham, London *Wollaton Hall, Nottinghamshire – late Tudor Tudor Revival In the 19th century a free mix of late Gothic elements, Tudor, and Elizabethan were combined for public buildings, such as hotels and railway stations, as well as for residences. The popularity continued into the 20th century for residential building. This type of Renaissance Revival architecture is called 'Tudor,' 'Mock Tudor,' 'Tudor Revival,' and 'Jacobethan.'

Pratt Mannix IV (October 27, 1911 – January 29, 1997) was an American author, journalist, photographer, sideshow performer, stage magician, animal trainer, and filmmaker. His best-known works are the 1958 book Those About to Die, which remained in continuous print for three decades and became the basis for the Ridley Scott movie Gladiator; and the 1967 novel The Fox and the Hound which in 1981 was adapted into an animated film by Walt Disney Productions. Childhood The Mannix family had a long history of service in the United States Navy, and Mannix' father, Daniel P. Mannix, III, was an American naval officer.The Old Navy by Rear Admiral Daniel P. Mannix, 3rd, as edited by Daniel P. Mannix 4th, Macmillan, 1983 His mother would often join her husband on his postings, and the Mannix children would stay at their grandparents' farm outside Philadelphia.Daniel P. Mannix, The Back-Yard Zoo, pp. 15–16. It was there that Mannix began to keep and raise various wild animals. In time, the cost of feeding them led him to write his first book, The Back-Yard Zoo.Daniel P. Mannix, The Back-Yard Zoo, p. 33. Following family tradition, Mannix enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy in 1930, but left the next year, moving to the University of Pennsylvania and earning a degree in journalism instead of zoology.Mark Davis and Andy Wallace, \\"Daniel Pratt Mannix 4th, 85, Adventurer And Author [obituary]\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 2, 1998. Career Mannix served as a naval lieutenant with the Photo-Science Laboratory in Washington, D.C. during World War II. His varied career included time spent as a sword swallower and fire eater in a traveling carnival sideshow, where he performed under the stage name The Great Zadma. His magazine articles about these experiences, co-written with his wife Jule Junker Mannix, proved very popular and were reprinted several times in 1944 and 1945, and later expanded into book form in his 1951 account of carnival life Step Right Up, which in turn was reprinted in 1964 as Memoirs of a Sword Swallower. He was also at times a professional hunter, a collector of wildlife for zoos and circuses, and a bird trainer. The latter skill was showcased in the 1956 short film Universal Color Parade: Parrot Jungle, in which he is credited as the writer, actor, director, producer, photographer, and bird trainer. Mannix covered a wide variety of subject matter as an author. His books ranged from fictional animal stories for children, the natural history of animals, and adventurous accounts about hunting big game to sensational adult non-fiction topics such as a biography of the occultist Aleister Crowley, sympathetic accounts of carnival performers and sideshow freaks, and works describing, among other things, the Hellfire Club, the Atlantic slave trade, the history of torture, and the Roman games. In 1983, he edited The Old Navy: The Glorious Heritage of the U.S. Navy, Recounted through the Journals of an American Patriot by Rear Admiral Daniel P. Mannix, 3rd, his father's posthumously-published autobiographical account of his life and naval career from the Spanish–American War of 1898 until his retirement in 1928. In his role as a photo-journalist, Mannix witnessed the death of the famed herpetologist Grace Olive Wiley when she was fatally bitten by a venomous snake. On July 20, 1948, Wiley, then 64 years old, invited Mannix to her home in Cypress, California, to photograph her collection of snakes. She posed for him with a venomous Indian cobra she had recently acquired, at Mannix's suggestion, and the snake bit her on the finger when it was spooked by his camera flash. At her instruction, Mannix put tourniquets on her arm, but unfortunately, in trying to administer her only vial of cobra antivenom he found the needle was rusty, and he accidentally broke the vial. At her request, he took her to Long Beach Municipal Hospital, but the hospital only had antivenom serums for North American snakes. Wiley was placed in an iron lung to assist her breathing, but to no avail; she was pronounced dead less than two hours after being bitten.\\"Creeping Death\\". Time. August 2, 1948. Fifteen years later, Mannix wrote an account of the event in his book All Creatures Great and Small, in which he titled Wiley the \\"Woman Without Fear.\\" Mannix was also a skilled stage magician,\\"Daniel Mannix, 85, Adventure Writer\\", New York Times, February 8, 1997 magic historian, and collector of illusions and apparatus. In 1957, he was one of the 16 charter members who co- founded the Munchkin Convention of the International Wizard of Oz Club.International Wizard of Oz Club : Munchkin Convention history He contributed numerous articles to The Baum Bugle, including on the subject of the 1902 musical extravaganza, The Wizard of Oz. Personal life Mannix and his wife and sometime co-author Jule Junker Mannix travelled around the world and raised exotic animals. Jule Mannix wrote the book Married to Adventure in 1954 as an autobiographical account of her adventurous life with Mannix. The couple had a son, Daniel Pratt Mannix, V, and a daughter, Julie Mannix Von Zerneck. From 1950 onward, Daniel and Jule Mannix lived in the same house in East Whiteland, near Malvern, Pennsylvania. Jule Mannix died May 25, 1977.Chester County Deed Book N24-585-153 Mannix died on January 29, 1997, at the age of 85, and was survived by his son and daughter, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Literary influence According to Martin M Winkler's book, Gladiator: Film and History, Mannix's 1958 non-fiction book Those About to Die (reprinted in 2001 as The Way of the Gladiator) was the inspiration for David Franzoni's screenplay for the 2000 movie Gladiator.Solomon, John (2004). \\"Gladiator from Screenplay to Screen.\\" In Winkler, Martin M.

The key is chosen and directed by the construction coordinator. Though, they are ostensibly of equal rank,(actually they are not equal in rank, since the construction coordinator answers directly to the production for the cost and coordination of set related tasks) the construction coordinator generally determines the order of work. The division of labor is basic: The coordinator and his carpenters build the components of the set, the construction grips erect, level, and plumb the set only if it is a set that has already been seen on camera. New construction is handled entirely by the carpenters (known as Propmakers). Then the carpenters trim the set in preparation for the scenic artists.occupationalinfo.org, grips In addition, the construction grips accomplish any rigging that may need to be done. This could be flying set pieces or facades, mounting and securing them onto existing structures or hanging and building pipe grids over and above the sets to hang lighting and other equipment from. Construction grips also build stable catwalks around and above the sets for people to walk on and or hang and attach more stuff to. Operating heavy machinery is required in most cases; in some regions this is done by the Teamsters. They are also responsible for any backdrops that need to be hung. Once complete, as per schedule, the shooting crew eventually comes in. The set is generally handed over to the regular shooting grips, unless there is a particularly large or complex piece that must be moved at a particular time. The construction grip department, in general, is also traditionally charged with the safety of the construction crew, engendering other various labors for the construction grips: the shop and set, (until it is turned over to the set dressers), must be maintained free of debris, and lumber and building materials must be stowed or racked in a safe, neat, and accessible manner.

H. Allen, 1879. January 18, 1821March 6, 1872) was a German Sanskrit scholar. Biography He was born of Jewish parents in Königsberg, Prussia. After attending the gymnasium of that town, he entered its university in 1836 as a student of Sanskrit. In 1838 he removed to Bonn, and, after graduating at Königsberg in 1840, proceeded to Paris; in 1842 he edited a German translation of the Prabodhacandrodaya by Kṛṣṇamiśra Yati (fl. c. 1050-1100), a standard text widely read by Sanskrit students in India. From 1847 to 1850 he resided at Berlin, where his talents and scholarship were recognized by Alexander von Humboldt, but where his political views caused the authorities to regard him with suspicion. He was asked to leave Berlin during the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. In 1850 he moved to London at the invitation of H. H. Wilson. In 1852 he was appointed professor of Sanskrit in University College London. He worked on a new edition of Wilson's Sanskrit dictionary, of which the first instalment appeared in 1856. But his work became infeasibly long and detailed, and publication of the dictionary ground to a halt. In 1861 he published his best known work Panini: his place in Sanscrit Literature. He was the founder of the Sanskrit Text Society (four volumes appeared); he was also an active member of the Philological Society, of which he was president at the time of his death; and of other learned bodies. He died in London. Works As Literary Remains some of his writings were published in two volumes (London, 1879), but his papers were left to the India Office with the request that they were not to be published until 1920.

Bisj poles can be erected as an act of revenge, to pay homage to the ancestors, to calm the spirits of the deceased and to bring harmony and spiritual strength to the community. Objects similar to Bisj poles are found among many peoples of the South Pacific islands, such as peoples from New Zealand and Vanuatu.  Design  Carved out of a single piece of a wild mangrovehttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/sisterwendy/works/bis.html tree, Bisj poles can reach heights of up to 25 feet (7.62 m). Their carvings depict human figures standing on top of each other, as well as animal figures, phallic symbols, and carvings in the shape of a canoe prow.  Purpose  Bisj poles are carved by Asmat religious carvers (wow-ipits) after a member of their tribe or community had been killed and headhunted by an enemy tribe. The Asmat participated in headhunting raids and cannibalism as rituals. The Asmat believed that if a member of the community had been headhunted, his spirit would linger in the village and cause disharmony. Bisj poles were erected in order to satisfy these spirits and send them to the afterlife (Safan) across the sea. Many rituals involved the Bisj poles, including dancing, masquerading, singing and headhunting—all performed by men. Bisj poles often had a receptacle at the base that was meant to hold the heads of enemies taken on headhunting missions. The phallic symbols represented the strength and virility of the community's ancestors as well as of the warriors going on the headhunting mission. Canoe prow symbols represented a metaphorical boat that would take the deceased spirits away to the afterlife. The human figures would represent deceased ancestors. Although headhunting ended in the Asmat region in the 1970s, the poles are still used in rituals today. Further reading * Van der Zee, Pauline, Etsjopok: Avenging the Ancestors.

It is bounded by the comuni of Barile, Ginestra, Lavello, Maschito, Montemilone, Palazzo San Gervasio, Rapolla and Spinazzola. History =Ancient= The city was known as Venusia (\\"City of Venus\\") to the Romans, who credited its establishment—as Aphrodisia (\\"City of Aphrodite\\")—to the Homeric hero Diomedes. He was said to have moved to Magna Graecia in southern Italy following the Trojan War, seeking a life of peace and building the town and its temples to appease the anger of Aphrodite for the destruction of her beloved Troy. The town was taken by the Romans after the Third Samnite War in 291 BC and became a colony. No fewer than 20,000 men were sent there, owing to its military importance. Throughout the Hannibalic wars it remained faithful to Rome, and had a further contingent of colonists sent in 200 BC to replace its losses in war. In 190 BC the Appian way was extended to the town. Some coins of Venusia of this period exist. It took part in the Social War, and was recaptured by Quintus Metellus Pius; it then became a municipium, but in 43 BC its territory was assigned to the veterans of the triumvirs, and it became a colony once more. Horace was born here in 65 BC. It remained an important place under the Empire as a station on the Via Appia, though Theodor Mommsen's description of it as having branch roads to Aequum Tuticum and Potentia, and Kiepert's maps annexed to the volume, do not agree with one another. =Middle Ages= After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Venusia was sacked by the Heruls, and in 493 AD it was turned into the administrative centre of the area in the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, although later this role was moved to Acerenza. The Lombards made it a gastaldate in 570/590. In 842 Venosa was sacked by the Saracens, who were later ousted by Emperor Louis II. Next rulers in the 9th century were the Byzantines, who lost control of it after their defeat in 1041 by the Normans. Under the latter, Venosa was assigned to Drogo of Hauteville. In 1133 the town was sacked and set on fire by Roger II of Sicily. His later successor Frederick II had a castle built here where a Lombard outpost existed before, which was to house the Treasury (Ministry of Finances) of the Kingdom of Sicily. Frederick's son, Manfred of Sicily, was born here in 1232. After the latter's fall, the Hohenstaufens were replaced by the Angevines; King Charles of Anjou assigned Venosa as a county to his son Robert. =Modern era= After a series of different feudal lords, Venosa became a possession of the Orsini in 1453. Count Pirro Del Balzo, who had married Donata Orsini, built a new castle (1460–1470) and a cathedral. Then, under the Aragonese domination, followed the Gesualdo family (1561); amongst their number was the famous prince, musician and murderer Carlo Gesualdo. Despite the plague that had reduced its population from the 13,000 of 1503 to 6,000, Venosa had a flourishing cultural life under the Gesualdos: apart from the famous Carlo, other relevant figures of the period include the poet Luigi Tansillo (1510–1580) and the jurist Giovanni Battista De Luca (1614–1683). Venosa took part in the revolt of Masaniello in 1647. The Gesualdos were in turn followed by the Ludovisi and the Caracciolo families. Home to a traditionally strong republican tradition, Venosa had a role in the peasant revolts and the Carbonari movement of the early 19th century. A true civil war between baronial powers and supporters of the peasants' rights broke out in 1849, being harshly suppressed by the Neapolitan troops.(See Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848.) In 1861, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies during the Italian unification, Venosa was occupied by some bands of brigands under the command of Carmine Crocco in order to restore the Bourbon power in Basilicata. Main sights The Aragonese Castle. The Church of SS. Trinità. The Archaeological Area of Notarchirico. *The Aragonese castle, built in 1470 by Pirro del Balzo Orsini. It has a square plan with four cylindrical towers. The shining sun, the del Balzo coat of arms, is visible on the western towers. It was turned into a residence by Carlo and Emanuele Gesualdo, who added also an internal loggia, the north-western wing and bastions used as prisons. From 1612 it was the seat of the Accademia dei Rinascenti. It is now home to the National Museum of Venosa, inaugurated in 1991, with ancient Roman and other findings up to the 9th century. The entrance is preceded by a fountain conceded by King Charles I of Anjou. *Many fragments of Roman workmanship are built into the walls of the cathedral, which is due to Pirro del Balzo also (c. 1470). *The abbey church of SS. Trinità is historically interesting; it was consecrated in 1059 by Pope Nicholas II and passed into the hands of the Knights of Saint John in the time of Boniface VIII (1295–1303). In the central aisle is the tomb of Alberada, the first wife of Robert Guiscard and mother of Bohemund. An inscription on the wall commemorates the great Norman brothers William Iron Arm, Drogo, Humfrey and Robert Guiscard. The bones of these brothers rest together in a simple stone sarcophagus opposite the tomb of Alberada. The church also contains some 14th-century frescoes. Behind it is a larger church, which was begun for the Benedictines about 1150, from the designs of a French architect, in imitation of the Cluniac church at Paray-le-Monial, but never carried beyond the spring of the vaulting. The ancient amphitheatre adjacent furnished the materials for its walls. *Baroque Church of the Purgatory (or San Filippo Neri) *The Archaeological Area of Notarchirico, in the communal territory. It covers the Palaeolithic period with eleven layers dating from 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

History The Walter Pyramid was officially opened on November 30, 1994, when it hosted a Long Beach State 49ers men's basketball game against the Detroit Titans, which aired live on ESPN. A standing-room only crowd of 5,021 saw Long Beach come away victorious with a final score of 71-64. The Walter Pyramid was designed by Don Gibbs and built by the Nielson Construction Company of San Diego. The building of Walter Pyramid cost approximately $22 million. Each side of the perimeter of Walter Pyramid measures , making it a mathematically true pyramid. It is one of only three true pyramid-style buildings in the United States, the others being Luxor Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada and Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee. The Walter Pyramid rises 18 stories above the Long Beach skyline and its exterior is uniformly clad in sheets of dark-blue corrugated aluminum. =Name change= On March 5, 2005, Long Beach State officially renamed The Pyramid to Walter Pyramid in honor of Mike and Arline Walter. The Walters were given this recognition for a $2.1 million donation given to the university. In addition to being the vice-president of Levi Strauss & Co., Mike Walter was also a dean for Long Beach State's College of Business Administration from 1993 to 2000. Tenants =University athletics= The Walter Pyramid is currently home to the Long Beach State men's basketball and Long Beach State women's basketball programs, as well as the Long Beach State men's volleyball and Long Beach State women's volleyball programs. All LBSU teams playing home games in the Walter Pyramid are nicknamed “the Beach”. The teams were previously known as the 49ers but that nickname was recently dropped. Prior to the construction of the Walter Pyramid on campus, the men's basketball team played some of their games in the Long Beach Arena in downtown Long Beach, and at the on-campus University Gymnasium later renamed Gold Mine, which has just 1,900 seats. In addition to being the home for Long Beach State athletics, the Walter Pyramid as hosted several NCAA-sponsored events including numerous women’s volleyball NCAA matches, the 2001 and 2003 NCAA Men’s Volleyball Championships and the 2003 NCAA Women’s Volleyball Regionals. =Non-university athletics= The Southern California Summer Pro League used the Walter Pyramid during the summer months from 1995 to 2007. The league showcased current and prospective NBA basketball players, including recent draft picks, current NBA players working on their skills and conditioning, and international professionals hoping to become NBA players. The league went on hiatus for the 2008 season and announced its intention to move to Los Angeles for 2009. The Walter Pyramid was also home to the Long Beach Stingrays, a women's professional basketball team of the now-defunct American Basketball League for a time in 1997 and 1998. The Walter Pyramid also hosts the World Brazilian Championships or, in Portuguese language, Mundials. New Japan Pro-Wrestling presented the show Strong Style Evolved on March 25, 2018, which sold out within minutes.

He was known as Napoléon V by his supporters. Biography =Early life= Prince Victor as a baby He was born in the Palais Royal of Paris during the Second French Empire the son of Prince Napoleon and his wife, Princess Marie Clothilde of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Two younger siblings would soon follow: Prince Louis (1864–1932) and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte (1866–1926), later the Duchess of Aosta. At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne behind Napoléon, Prince Imperial and his father. The Empire came to an end in 1870 with the abdication of the Emperor Napoleon III. =Bonaparte heir= He was appointed head of the house of Bonaparte at the age of 18 in the will of Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial, who died in 1879, and so became Napoleon V to his supporters, though his younger brother, Prince Louis, a colonel in the Russian Imperial Guard, was preferred to him by many Bonapartists. The decision by the Prince Imperial to bypass Prince Victor's father led to a complete breakdown in relations between father and son. In May 1886 the French Republic expelled the princes of the former ruling dynasties and so Prince Victor left France for exile in Belgium. =Dreyfus affair= Guth At the time of the death of President Félix Faure in 1899, during the Dreyfus affair, a number of political factions attempted to take advantage of the disorder and Prince Victor announced to a delegation from the Imperialist committee that he would take action to restore the French Empire when he felt that the time was favourable. In order to achieve this, he announced he would place himself at the head of the movement with his brother, Prince Louis, fighting beside him who he said would be \\"bringing to the Bonapartist forces his prestige and his military talents as well as his rank in the Russian army\\". The Duke of Orléans, rival claimant to the throne, also had forces available and they were ready to cross the French frontier at same time as the Bonapartist forces. In the end the anticipated outbreak in France did not materialise and the French Third Republic survived one of its gravest crises. =Death= Prince Victor died on 3 May 1926 in Brussels with the French author Charles Maurras commenting on Prince Victor's time as pretender saying that he had not offered any new ideas since 1884 and no radical alternatives to republican governments. He was succeeded as the Bonaparte heir by his only son, Prince Louis.

Many of the original drawings used by Richter as the basis for his coloured lithographs were by Gould's wife, Elizabeth Coxen, produced before her death in 1841.Stephens, M 2009, Henry Constantine Richter (about 1821-1902), Australian Museum, Sydney NSW, accessed 02 Dec 2017, https://australianmuseum.net.au/henry-constantine-richter- about-1821-1902.Cook, KS 2013, ‘Gould collections at KU: the story of the Gould Collection’, John Gould: Bird Illustration in the Age of Darwin, University of Kansas, accessed 3 Dec 2017, https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/about/kucollections. Richter's reputation was overshadowed by that of his much-celebrated employer. Since it was not customary to acknowledge illustrators alongside authors in the titles of publications, his name was forgotten. But in 1978, his great ability and the extent of his contribution to Gould's work came to light, in the work of the researcher Christine E. Jackson.Jackson, CE 2011, ‘The painting of hand- coloured zoological illustrations’, Archives of Natural History, 38, 1, pp. 36-52.

Architect, Thomas Hardwick Richter was born in Brompton, London in England on 7 Jun 1821, into an artistic family. His father, Henry James Richter (1772-1857), was a philosopher, painter and engraver who was born in Soho, Middlesex, England to Mary Haigh, the wife of John Augustus Richter, an immigrant from Dresden, Germany - himself an artist and engraver.Cust, LH 2012,‘Richter, Henry James’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 3 Dec 2017, https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/23599. Richter's mother, Charlotte Sophia Edson (1793-1862), had married his father on 2 May 1818 in Marylebone, Middlesex, England. He was their first child. His birth was followed by that of his sister Antonia Charlotte (1823-1896) and his brother Charles (b.1827). A half-sister - Henrietta Sophia (1814-1896) had already been born to Henry James Richter's first wife, Elizabeth Smith (1787-1816), whom he had married on 9 July 1808, and lost after eight years' marriage. Henry James Richter became a well-respected and popular artist - he was a member, and president (1811-1812), of the Associated Artists in Water Colours, exhibiting frequently. He was also elected to membership of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours. Several of his works are owned by the British Museum. Artistic talent also flourished elsewhere in Richter's family: his half- sister, Henrietta Sophia, became a successful miniature portrait artist, and exhibited at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts in London, 1842–1849.Kansas Library n.d., Henry Constantine Richter, University of Kansas Library, Lawrence, Kansas, accessed 5 Dec 2017, https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/art/henry_constantine_richter.Jackson, C 1978, ‘H. C. Richter–John Gould's unknown bird artist’, Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History, Volume 9, Issue 1, 11 1978, pages 10-14. The English census returns Census Returns of England and Wales, 1851. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1851. indicate that the Richters were a close-knit family. For example, in 1851, the 30 year-old Richter was still living with his parents. Henry James Richter did not own a house, but always lived in rented accommodation. In that year, when he was aged 79, his household consisted of: his wife, Charlotte Sophia, his adult son, both of his adult daughters and one servant. This arrangement may have been out of financial necessity as much as family affection - artist and lithographers were paid very little. As related by Jackson (p. 48), one practitioner, GJ Keulmans, wrote of his remuneration: \\"it has just saved me from starvation and nothing else\\".  The technique of lithography  Richter's work with his coloured lithographs was breaking new ground at the time. The technique was labour- intensive and demanded great skill and attention to minute detail. The University of Tasmanian explains the process that artists use to produce a lithograph from an image, such as a sketch, a drawing or a painting: Lithographic stones, Museum of the Printing Arts, Leipzig, Germany > Lithography is essentially a chemical process. A drawing is made with a > greasy crayon on limestone, then gum arabic and nitrate acid is rubbed into > the material, changing its molecular structure so that when ink is applied > it adheres to the crayon marks, but not the stone. Fine details are more > difficult to achieve, but tonal qualities are easily suggested and it is > possible for a drawing to be made directly onto the stone. The result is a > more spontaneous impression, with the broad, fluid lines of a crayon and > tonal planes producing a much softer or subtler result than that produced by > the black and white linear imprint of engravings. - University of > Tasmania.University of Tasmania, 2007, 'Imaging the thylacine: the exotic > thylacine', Exhibitions, Hobart, Tasmania, accessed 3 Dec 2017, > http://www.utas.edu.au/library/exhibitions/thylacine/exotic.html. John Gould was an experienced taxidermist, using his skill to preserve the skins of birds from his various worldwide expeditions. These skins were used by his artists to guide their illustrations, together with initial sketches made by Gould to indicate his requirements for the exact appearance of the finished images. The London Zoo was opened to the public in 1847 and was a further source of models of birds and animals for Richter's drawings. Career Richter's earliest published bird illustrations were three plates in the book Genera of birds (1844–1849) by George Robert Gray. The plates depicted the Indian Barn Owl Strix javanica, the head and claws of two other owls, and a member of the pheasant and partridge family, Clapperton's spurfowl Pternistis clappertoni.Gray, GR 1848, The genera of birds : comprising their generic characters, a notice of the habits of each genus, and an extensive list of species referred to their several genera, Longman, London. His illustrations attracted the favourable attention of ornithologists. Tasmanian tiger Thylacinus cynocephalus, 1841, Plate 54 of Mammals of Australia, vol.I, J.Gould & H.C. Richter. The thylacine became extinct in 1936 In 1841 Richter was contacted by the zoologist John Gould, who urgently needed an illustrator, after the death of his wife Elizabeth Coxen (1804-1841), because he had committed to producing various parts of his lavish books on certain dates. The Gould-Richter working relationship lasted for forty years, until Gould died in 1881. Richter created about 3,000 lithographic plates and watercolours for Gould. Other illustrators employed by Gould included Edward Lear, William Matthew Hart and Joseph Wolf, although it was Richter who produced the vast majority of the works during Gould's lifetime.Sauer, GC 1982, John Gould the bird man: a chronology and bibliography, Landsdowne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Yellow-bellied Tit Parus venustulus, between 1850 and 1883, The Birds of Asia. Volume 2, J. Gould & H.C. Richter Amongst his best known illustrations are those of the male and female thylacine, from Gould's Mammals of Australia (1845–63) - frequently copied since publication. For example, an Australian company Cascade Brewery used the image on the label for one of their brands of beer, in 1987. Previously, the Tasmanian Government had published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image, in 1934 Government Tourist Bureau, Tasmania, Tasmania: The Wonderland, Hobart, Government Printer, Tasmania, 1934 and, earlier still, the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends and Foes (1881). In his will, John Gould wrote \\"I bequeath to my Artist H C Richter a legacy of £100 as a kind remembrance for the purchase of a [mourning] ring or any other article that he may prefer\\". He seems to have been unconcerned about the impecunious state of his 60-year-old artist, although Richter had contributed so materially to his own prosperity for over four decades. After Gould's death Richter gained a small amount of work for Gray's Birds of Asia, and he prepared a plate for Sir Richard Owen's Memoirs on the extinct wingless birds of New Zealand (1878—1879 ). Work already completed by him was used in Gould's books that were published posthumously, such as Birds of Asia, but new plates for the books were commissioned from William Hart. Final years Lacking a regular income after the death of Gould, Richter became dependent upon his sister, Antonia Charlotte, who had married a wealthy Nottinghamshire farmer with property in Ranby, Henry Francis Noble Champion. Antonia Champion had become a widow in 1854, one year after her marriage, and she inherited her husband's London residence in the Lisson Grove area of London. She continued to live there alone with a servant, and did not marry again. After John Gould's death Antonia Champion took in her brother and their half-sister Henrietta Sophia Richter. Since Henry James Richter's death in 1857 they had been living in pauper's lodgings in the Lisson Grove area, with their mother whilst she was alive. When Antonia Champion died in 1896, the house passed to Richter, and he stayed there until his death. The probate administration record states that he died 16 March 1902, and that administration occurred 17 April 1902. His estate was valued at just under 840 pounds. Nothing is known of the life of Richter's younger brother, Charles Richter, beyond a mention in the English Census of 1841, when he was 14 years of age and living with his parents. In 1896, Richter had lost not only his sister, Antonia Charlotte Champion (in January), but also his half-sister, Henrietta Sophia Richter (in October), and since none of them had children, the Richter family line appears to have ended with the passing of Henry Constantine Richter.

Independently governed and supported as a 501(c)(3) organization, WiCell operates as an affiliate of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and works to advance stem cell research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and beyond. History Established in 1998 to develop stem cell technology, WiCell Research Institute is a nonprofit organization that creates and distributes human pluripotent stem cell lines worldwide. WiCell also provides cytogenetic and technical services, establishes scientific protocols and supports basic research on the UW-Madison campus. WiCell serves as home to the Wisconsin International Stem Cell Bank. This stem cell repository stores, characterizes and provides access to stem cell lines for use in research and clinical development. The cell bank originally stored the first five human Embryonic stem cell lines derived by Dr. James Thomson of UW–Madison. It currently houses human embryonic stem cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell lines, clinical grade cell lines developed in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and differentiated cell lines including neural progenitor cells. To support continued progress in the field and help unlock the therapeutic potential of stem cells, in 2005 WiCell began providing cytogenetic services and quality control testing services. These services allow scientists to identify genetic abnormalities in cells or changes in stem cell colonies that might affect research results. Organization Chartered with a mission to support scientific investigation and research at UW–Madison, WiCell collaborates with faculty members and provides support with stem cell research projects. The institute established its cytogenetic laboratory to meet the growing needs of academic and commercial researchers to monitor genetic stability in stem cell cultures. Facilities WiCell maintains its stem cell banking facilities, testing and quality assurance laboratories and scientific team in UW–Madison’s University Research Park. UW–Madison faculty members use the institute’s laboratory space to conduct research, improve stem cell culture techniques and develop materials used in stem cell research. To ensure the therapeutic relevance of its cell lines, WiCell banks clinical grade cells under GMP guidelines. The organization works cooperatively with Waisman Biomanufacturing, a provider of cGMP manufacturing services for materials and therapeutics qualified for human clinical trials. Selected technologies The following technologies employed by WiCell allow scientists to conduct stem cell research with greater assurance of reproducible results, an expectation for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Scientific tools and services include: * G-banded karyotyping, a baseline genomic screen that helps monitor genetic stability as cell colonies grow; * Spectral karyotyping, which may be used as an adjunct to g-banded karyotyping and helps define complex rearrangements as well as genetic marker chromosomes; * CGH, SNP, and CGH + SNP Microarrays, which detect genomic gains and losses as well as copy number changes; * Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a test used to confirm findings and screen for microdeletions or duplications of known targets; * fastFISH, a rapid screen for large numbers of clones and a cost-effective tool for monitoring aneuploidy; and * Short Tandem Repeat Analysis, which may be used to monitor the identity of a cell line and confirm the relationship of induced pluripotent stem cells to their parent.

One of his poems was included in the Mu'allaqat. Taghlibs The great Basus War, which was between the Taghlibs and the Bakrs, lasted for approximately forty years until the Lakhmids king of al-Hirah, 'Amr ibn Hind, urged them to make peace with each other on condition that some of their children were to be taken hostages by the king. The King of Hira said one day to his drinking companions, \\"Do you know anyone among the Arabs whose mother declines serving my mother?\\" They replied, \\"Yes, Amr Ibn Kulthum.\\" The king asked, \\"Why is that?\\" His companions replied, \\"Because her father is Al-Muhalhel Bin Rabī'ah, her uncle is Kolaib a prestigious Arabian, her spouse is Kulthum Ibn Malik Ibn Etab an astounding knight of Arabs and her son is Amr ibn Kulthum chief of his clan.\\" After that the king sent for Amr Ibn Kulthum asking him to visit along with his mother Layla. Kulthum accepted the king's invitation and visited him with his companions and his mother. After they arrived and while Layla was sitting, the mother of the king (the aunt of Imru' al-Qais) Hind asked her to pass the plate, to which Layla replied, \\"let the one in need go to her need\\" and when Hind insisted, Layla shouted saying: \\"What a humiliation!\\" Her son heard her and was so deeply stirred by the insult that he took his sword and decapitated the king of al-Hirah and killed his guards then left. This exploit may be a legend of the Umayyad era. Ode In his ode, the first eight verses are a wine song which perhaps were added later but suit the poem very well. The next thematic section narrates his lady's departure on her litter (a chair placed on camel's back that veiled women from strangers, dust and sun), and the joy of the sword-fight. Finally he deals with several types of grief - camels over their young, mothers for sons, the departure of lovers and the grief brought by fate. At this point in the ode he covers the philosophy of the uncertainty of life and fate. Next, he addresses the grandfather of the victim - Amr b.

Biography  Considerant was born in Salins-les-Bains, Jura and studied at the École Polytechnique (1826 diploma). Subsequently, working as a musician, he collaborated with Fourier on newspapers. He edited the journals La Phalanstère and La Phalange. Considerant wrote much in advocacy of his principles, of which the most important is La Destinée Sociale. He authored Democracy Manifesto, which preceded by five years the similar Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels. Considerant defined the notion of a \\"right to (have) work\\", which would be one of the main ideas of French socialists in the 1848 Revolutions. He is also known for having devised the proportional representation system. He also advocated such measures of 'direct democracy' (a term he coined) as referendum and recall. The failure of an insurrection against Louis Napoléon obliged Considerant to go into exile in Belgium in June 1849. On an invitation by Albert Brisbane and helped by Jean-Baptiste Godin, between 1855-57 he founded the colony La Réunion in Texas on Fourier's principles. He was a member of the First International, founded in 1864, and took part in the 1871 Paris Commune. He died in Paris in 1893.

This arena was the premiere sports and entertainment venue in the Stockton area until the completion of Stockton Arena in 2005. Tenants Alex G. Spanos Center is currently the home for several University of the Pacific's sports programs, including the Pacific Tigers men's basketball, Pacific Tigers women's basketball and Pacific Tigers women's volleyball. On October 15, 2008, Pacific hosted a pre-season NBA exhibition between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Sacramento Kings.

It is the former home of the Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans basketball team, the defunct Arkansas GlacierCats of the WPHL (now defunct) and the defunct Arkansas Impact of the PBL. The Trojans moved into Alltel Arena, when it opened in 1999 and remained there, until the team moved into Jack Stephens Center in 2005. Prior to the Trojans' move to the Sun Belt Conference, the venue hosted five Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC) men's basketball tournaments in 1983, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990. It has since hosted three Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournaments. During the annual Arkansas State Fair, the coliseum is the venue for the fair's rodeo events. Additionally, it is used as the location throughout the year for spectator events featuring monster trucks, motorcycle acrobatics, and other shows. Countless rock concerts were held here until the completion of Alltel Arena. This fan-friendly site sold general admission tickets so that hardcore fans arriving hours before the doors opened could just about guarantee themselves a spot on the barrier.

It is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Originally established in 1869 by New York–based Christian missionaries for the education of freed slaves and their offspring, from 1871 until 1892 the college served as a teachers' training school funded by the state of Mississippi. In 1998, the buildings of the old campus were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Tougaloo College has a rich history of civic and social activism including the Tougaloo Nine. The college hosted the 50th Anniversary Celebration of Freedom Summer in June 2014. History =Establishment= In 1869, the American Missionary Association of New York purchased of one of the largest former plantations in central Mississippi to build a college for freedmen and their children, recently freed slaves. The purchase included a standing mansion and outbuildings, which were immediately converted for use as a school.Edward Mayes, History of Education in Mississippi. United States Bureau of Education Circular of Information No. 2, 1889. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1899; p. 259. The next year expansion of facilities began in earnest with the construction of two new buildings — Washington Hall, a 70-foot-long edifice containing classrooms and a lecture hall, and Boarding Hall, a two- story building which included a kitchen and dining hall, a laundry, and dormitories for 30 female students. Costs of construction were paid by the United States government through the education department of its Bureau of Refugees and Freedmen. Additional funds, totaling $25,500 in all, were provided for development of the school farm, including monies for farm implements and livestock. In 1871, the Mississippi State Legislature granted the new institution a formal charter under the name of Tougaloo University. No contingency fund was provided for the day-to-day operation of the school, with some students paying a tuition of $1 per month while others attended tuition free, contributing labor on the school farm in lieu of fees. The cost of two teachers at the school for five months were paid by the county boards of education of Hinds and Madison Counties; all additional operating funds were provided by the American Missionary Association. In its initial incarnation, Tougaloo University was not a university in the modern sense of the term, instead serving as an institution which provided basic education of black students born under slavery along with the training of capable African- American students for service as teachers. At the end of 1871, the school included 94 \\"elementary students\\", 47 that were part of the \\"normal school\\", and 1 categorized as \\"academic\\" — a total student body of 142.Mayes, History of Education in Mississippi, p. 260. At this time the school found itself in dire need of expanded facilities and operational funds and an appeal was made by three leaders of Tougaloo University to the Mississippi Superintendent of Public Education for a state role in the institution. Legislation followed authorizing the establishment of a State Normal School on the grounds of Tougaloo and providing a total of $4,000 for two years to help provide teachers' salaries, student aid, and for the purchase of desks. As part of the establishment of the Normal School at Tougaloo, each county in the state was provided with two free scholarships, and every student declaring an intention to teach in Mississippi's common schools was to be allotted a stipend of 50 cents per week out of the state funds for student aid, an amount capped at $1,000 per year.Mays, History of Education in Mississippi, p. 261. In 1873, Tougaloo University added a theological department for students intending on entering the Christian ministry and expanded its industrial department, adding a cotton gin, apparatus for grinding corn, and developing capacity for the manufacture of simple furniture on site. On January 23, 1881, Washington Hall — the main classroom building — caught fire during religious services and was entirely destroyed.Mayes, History of Education in Mississippi, p. 263. For the rest of the academic year, classes were conducted in a new barn recently constructed on campus, nicknamed \\"Ayrshire Hall\\". In the spring, a brickyard was established on campus and on May 31, 1881, the foundation was laid for a new classroom building, a three-storey facility named Strieby Hall after Reverend M.E. Strieby of New York, a venerated leader of the American Missionary Association. =Return to private status= Tougaloo remained predominantly a teacher training school until 1920 when the College ceased to receive aid from the state. Courses for college credit were first offered in 1897, and the first Bachelor of Arts degree was awarded in 1901. In 1916, the name of the institution was changed to Tougaloo College. =Merger= Six years after Tougaloo's founding, the Home Missionary Society of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) obtained a charter from the Mississippi State Legislature to establish a school at Edwards, Mississippi, to be known as Southern Christian Institute. The two schools had similar ideals and goals, and therefore, merged in 1954. The new college combined the resources of the two supporting bodies and renewed its dedication to educational advancement and the improvement of race relations in Mississippi. The alumni bodies of the two institutions united to become the National Alumni Association of Tougaloo Southern Christian College. In 1962, by vote of the Board of Trustees, and with the agreement of the supporting bodies, the school's name was returned to its last before the 1954 merger, Tougaloo College. =School today= Dr. Carmen J. Walters, the fourteenth president (and second female president), began her tenure July 1, 2019. Campus The campus includes a Historic District, which comprises ten buildings that are each listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The three anchors of the Historic District are the Robert O. Wilder Building, also known as \\"The Mansion\\"; Woodworth Chapel, and Brownlee Gymnasium. Standing in the center of the campus, \\"The Mansion\\" overlooks the ensemble of buildings forming the College's historic core. The Mansion, constructed in 1860, was the home of John W. Boddie, a wealthy cotton planter, and the centerpiece of his plantation. The first building to be used for Tougaloo College, it is the oldest building on campus. It is presently being restored. Woodworth Chapel, originally known as Woodworth Church, was built in 1901 by students under the direction of Walker Frazier, head carpenter. It was restored and rededicated in 2002. In September 2004, the National Trust for Historic Preservation awarded Tougaloo College the National Preservation Honor Award for the restoration of Woodworth Chapel. The restoration was also recognized by the Mississippi Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, who bestowed its Honor Award. Woodworth Chapel houses the Union Church, founded alongside the college as a Congregational Church. Today, it is one of two congregations of the United Church of Christ in Mississippi. Located in the heart of the campus beside Woodworth Chapel is Brownlee Gymnasium. Built in 1947, the building was named in honor of Dr. Fred L. Brownlee, former general secretary of the American Missionary Association. The College holds the prestigious Tougaloo Art Collection. It was begun in 1963, by a group of prominent New York artists, curators and critics, initiated by the late Dr. Ronald Schnell, Professor Emeritus of Art, as a mechanism to motivate his art students. The collection consists of pieces by African American, American and European artists. Included in the African- American portion of the collection are pieces by notable artists Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, David Driskell, Richard Hunt, Elizabeth Catlett and Hale Woodruff. The 1,150 works in the Tougaloo Art Collection include paintings, sculptures, drawings, collages, various forms of graphic art and ornamental pieces. The Tougaloo Art Colony is another distinctive resource of the College. Begun in 1997 under the leadership of former College trustee, Jane Hearn, the Tougaloo Art Colony affords its participants exposure to and intensive instruction by nationally and internationally renowned artists. The annual one-week venue is held in July and includes a Thursday night event open to the public. Past instructors include David Driskell, David R. MacDonald, John McDaniel, Akemi Nakana Cohn, Moe Booker, Jamaal Sheats, Jerre Allen, Kevin Cole, Gail Shaw-Clemons and Hyun Chong Kim. Tougaloo College holds The Civil Rights Library and Archives. Among the items in The Civil Rights Library and Archives are the original papers, photographs and memorabilia of such luminaries as Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, it contains works of notable writers, poets and blues great, B.B. King. Many of these are rare, valuable first editions. The College established the Medgar Evers Museum in 1996. The Evers family (trustee Myrlie Evers- Williams and her children with Medgar) donated their home to Tougaloo College for its historical significance. In 1996, the home was restored to its condition at the time of Mr. Evers' assassination in the driveway. It is operated as a house museum and is open to the public. Ghosts of Mississippi (1996) included scenes filmed at the house and chronicled the quest for justice following Mr. Evers' assassination. The production company helped provide funding for restoration of the house. Academics According to the Tougaloo College website, the college has \\"historically produced over 40% of the African American physicians and dentists practicing in the state of Mississippi, more than one-third of the state's African American attorneys and educators including teachers, principals, school superintendents, college/university faculty and administrators.\\"Tougaloo College QuickFacts, Tougaloo College (last accessed November 4, 2018).

Until 2018, the agency's official title was Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional (Center for Investigation and National Security), commonly known as CISEN, which was established in 1989 after its predecessors ceased to operate. The CNI is the main intelligence agency in Mexico, although the Navy, Army, Air Force and the Office of the Attorney General maintain intelligence bodies dedicated to assist the functions of each one. Formally, the CNI is charged with \\"investigations and intelligence, which contribute to the preservation of the State's integrity, stability and endurance\\" History The Center for Investigation and National Security (CISEN) was created 13 February 1989 in order to provide the Mexican state of civil intelligence agency more in line with the political and social transformations experienced by the country at that time and suitable for cope with the challenges posed by the end of the Cold War. The CNI has developed an intelligence system designed to alert civil risks and threats to national security and has trained a body of experienced intelligence professionals to serve the nation. Throughout its existence, has witnessed the transition to a political system increasingly pluralistic, the revolution in communications and information technologies and the configuration of a complex international environment poses new challenges to national security. These realities have forced the CNI to embark on a process of constant transformation, to explore new mechanisms for cooperation and develop new capabilities that, without neglecting the traditional themes of national security, enable alert from a strategic perspective on an increasingly broad spectrum of risks and threats involving, among others, the social, economic and political development, environmental and epidemiological contingencies and natural disasters. In the late nineties, there was a decisive step in the consolidation of the vocation of CISEN to generate strategic intelligence to the transfer of the structures responsible for neutralizing the threats to the newly created Federal Preventive Police. This allowed institutional focus efforts on strengthening the work of collecting, processing and dissemination of strategic intelligence. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on the Pentagon and the Twin Towers in New York as well as the bombings in Madrid and London in 2004 and 2005, respectively, marked a watershed for the international intelligence community and returned to put the fight against international terrorism as a major threat to security and stability. Consequently, and against the relevance of these threats, CNI cooperation with foreign intelligence services became a priority with an even greater strategic weight. On the other hand, like all other state institutions, CISEN regime has moved toward accountability increasingly transparent, consistent with the democratic constitutional order in the country, and careful of the peculiarities of the field National Security. As a result of this, the National Security Act establishing the terms of the responsibility of the Legislative, Judicial and Executive on Homeland Security, and the powers, scope, limits and mechanisms CNI control. Before taking office, President Andres Manuel López Obrador had been critical of CISEN's opacity in its operations and practices, which included telephone tapping on the political adversaries and ideological dissidents of the incumbent administrations. This prompted AMLO to release a number of non- sensitive dossiers kept by CISEN, as well as implementing changes to the agency itself, most notably its name to the present CNI in November 2018.https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/mexico%E2%80%99s-strategic- confusion Although mostly regarded as a rebrand (keeping its faculties and internal structure intact), one notable structural change was its placement under the control of the reinstated Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection, thus removing it from under the Secretariat of the Interior.

In the 1820s, the popularity of this author, upon whom was bestowed the epithet \\"the prince of the romantics\\", rivalled that of Victor Hugo. His father Louis-Adrien Prévost d'Arlincourt was guillotined on 8 May 1794, along with Antoine Lavoisier and 26 other farmers-general. At the beginning of the First Empire, his mother pleaded his cause before Napoleon, who decided to name him écuyer (\\"squire\\") to Madame Mère. At the age of 29, he married the daughter of a senator, and composed a tragedy, Charlemagne, which was declined by the Théâtre-Français. In 1811 Napoleon appointed him as a master (auditeur) at the Council of State, then as an intendant in the Spanish army. He participated in the Spanish campaign and was present at the capture of Tarragona. After the fall of Napoleon, he succeeded in ingratiating himself with Louis XVIII, who named him Master of Requests. He bought a chateau and adopted the title of viscount. In 1818, he orchestrated a huge publicity campaign for the publication of his epic poem, Charlemagne, ou la Caroléide, and presented himself before the Academy, where his candidature obtained exactly one vote. Undiscouraged, he began work on a novel which he believed would bring him as great a reputation as Chateaubriand's. Le Solitaire appeared in 1821 and achieved an \\"extraordinary, even colossal, celebrity.\\" In the space of several months, the book was reprinted a dozen times; it was translated into ten languages; there were no fewer than seven operas based on its story, and twice as many dramatic adaptations; and it was the subject of innumerable songs, parodies, paintings and lithographs. The success of his next three novels, Le Renégat in 1822, Ipsiboé in 1823, and L'Étrangère in 1825, was almost as great. Adulated above all by his female readership, who saw him as \\"the new Ossian\\", he was harpooned by critics. His plot points were judged impossible, his characters cardboard, and his imagery grotesque. His taste for syntactic inversions, with which he generously adorned his prose, led to the nickname \\"the inversive Viscount\\", and the result was memorably parodied in Illusions perdues by Balzac (who, nevertheless, was strongly influenced in his first works by the gothic style of d'Arlincourt). The Academic Charles-Marie de Féletz wrote that \\"Le Solitaire has so far been translated into every single known language, except of course French.\\" Later assessments were no more favourable. His novels, now classified as \\"gothic\\", were then labelled frénétique: \\"containing a mysterious intrigue centred on some illustrious and guilty wretch who traipses through a thousand violent incidents towards a bloody catastrophe.\\" D'Arlincourt's vanity and egocentricity were the subject of many anecdotes, including a story of his attempts to persuade his portrait-painter, Robert Lefèvre, to make his eyes look larger and larger, until they were \\"like those of an ox\\"; the result was still considered unsatisfactory by his wife, who confronted the painter, turning to her husband and telling him to \\"Do that thing with your eyes.\\" (Mon ami, fais tes yeux.)The Atheneum, or the Spirit of the English magazines. Volume III. April to September 1825. Boston: John Cotton. Pages 171ff. He also posed for Jean-Baptiste Isabey. D'Arlincourt frequently defended himself in print, explaining that it was his goal to \\"spiritualize all the impressions of existence\\"; he presented a play he wrote in his youth, Le Siège de Paris, at the Théâtre-Français in 1826, but it was promptly torn to pieces by the critics. Not always justly: some of the most ridiculed extracts are not in fact by him. He made two long journeys through Europe, in 1841 and 1844, visiting exiled princes, and on his return presented a new play, La Peste noire, which was received no more favourably than the first. In 1848, outraged by the events of June, he published Dieu le veut! (\\"God wills it!\\"), a pamphlet which led to legal troubles for the author but also increased his popularity. In 1850 he published L'Italie rouge, a hostile account of the Risorgimento. In the last years of his life, still \\"avid for acclaim\\", he was a frequent guest of salons.

He is the earliest Italian painter whose name is found inscribed on an extant work. He is best known for his crucifixes.  Works  He is said to have exercised his art from 1202 to 1236. He may perhaps have been born towards 1180 in Pisa, and died in or soon after 1250; but other accounts give 1202 as the date of his birth, and the more probable date of 1258 or thereabouts for his death. There is some ground for thinking that his family name was Capiteno or Capitino. Giunta Pisano usually painted upon cloth stretched on wood, and prepared with plaster. The inscribed work, referred above, is also one of his earliest. It is the Crocefisso di San Raniero, a crucifix, that hung a long time in the kitchen of the convent of St Anne in Pisa. Other Pisan works of about the same date (as the one in National Museum of San Matteo, Pisa) are very barbarous, and, some of them may be also from the hand of Giunta Pisano before he had achieved his virtuosity (such as S. Benedetto Crucifixion). A painting of a crucifixion (1236) for the High Altar of the upper church of Assisi no longer exists,'Giunta Pisano', Encyclopædia Britannica online (part of article requires subscription to view). but there exists an 18th-century engraving based on a copy of this portrait Rosalind B. Brooke , Early Franciscan Government, Cambridge University Press; In the sacristy is a portrait of St Francis, also ascribed to Giunta; but it more probably belongs to the close of the 13th century. His masterpiece is the imposing Crucifix (1250) in the left transept of Basilica of Saint Dominic in Bologna, with the writing in Latin \\"Cuius docta manus me pixit Junta Pisanus\\" (painted by the learned or skilled hand of Giunta Pisano). It is still much influenced by the Byzantine style and represents one of the best examples of 13th-century Italian painting.  Influence  These crucifixes show that he initiated a new way of representing Christ, eventually substituting once and for all the traditional Byzantine image of Jesus serene though crucified (Christus gloriosus) with a Christ dying in agony (Christus patiens). This representation of Christ, and especially the crucifix in Basilica of St Dominic in Bologna, has much influenced Cimabue, who would continue on this style and develop his own more emotional style (as seen in his Crucifix in Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence). Another thoroughly Giuntesque Crucifixion is the right wing of a diptych from the Veneto, found at the Chicago Art Institute. A number of unknown Italian artists have been identified as members of Giunta's circle; among them are the Master of the Blue Crucifixes, the Master of the Treasury, and Vicino da Pistoia.Guida di Pistoia per gli amanti delle belle arti con notizie By Francesco Tolomei, 1821, page 204.

Biography Fuller was born in Deerfield, Massachusetts. His father, Aaron Fuller, was a farmer. His mother was Aaron's second wife, Fanny Negus of Petersham, Massachusetts. His parents were not in favor of Fuller becoming a painter. At age thirteen, he went to Boston, Massachusetts to work for a grocer, then tried selling shoes before giving up on this also and returning home. A year or so later, he went to Illinois with a survey team for the railroad, and continued working with the survey team for a couple of years. Fuller then returned home once again, entered Deerfield Academy, and began to paint in his spare time. In 1841, his desire to paint overcame his parents' opposition. He joined his half-brother Augustus as an itinerant painter, and enjoyed some success painting portraits in northern New York. That winter he went to Albany where he studied painting with Henry Kirke Brown for nine months. The next two winters, he studied painting with the Boston Artists' Association, working on the family farm in the summers. In 1846 he sold A Nun at Confession for six dollars. In 1847, he enrolled in the National Academy of Design in New York. He spent most of the next ten years in New York. Some winters he spent in the southern United States painting portraits and scenes about local life. Friends included painter E.T. Billings, with whom he travelled in the south.Sarah Burns.

Images of Slavery: George Fuller's Depictions of the Antebellum South. American Art Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Summer, 1983) In 1857 he was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design. The Quadroon (study) by Fuller His father died in 1859, and he became aware that he would eventually need to return to the family farm to support his family. In January 1860 he began five month a tour of Europe with friends during which they visited London, Paris, Florence, Rome, and Venice. He married Agnes Higginson of Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1861 and brought her home to the Deerfield farm. For the next fifteen years, he worked the farm and painted in his spare time in a studio converted form a carriage house. His farm failed in 1875, and he turned to painting for his livelihood. In the spring of 1876, the opening of his first art exhibition relaunched his career as a painter. In 1878 the National Academy exhibition included his Turkey Pasture in Kentucky and By the Wayside. The following year he sent to the Academy And She Was a Witch and The Romany Girl. He sent more pictures to the Academy in 1881 as his reputation and commercial success grew. In 1878, Fuller showed the oil painting, Reapers Resting, as his first exhibited at the Boston Art Club. Subsequently, at the Boston Art Club, he exhibited one oil painting, Head, in 1880; one oil painting, Portrait of Miss A___ in 1881; three oil paintings: Study Head, Portrait of Miss F., and Maidenhood, at the 1882 Boston Art Club exhibition; and the final oil painting he exhibited at the Club, Portrait of Miss C., was January 19–February 16, 1884. His work continued to enjoy success until his death March 21, 1884, of pneumonia. A memorial exhibition of his works was held at the Boston Museum of the Fine Arts in 1884. Examples of Fuller's artwork reside in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The museum and arboretum were originally developed on 5 acres (20,000 m²) in the 1940s by Eugene Hastie, a farmer and local historian of Dallas County. He planted his arboretum in straight lines to allow farming between the trees, and in 1953 opened his museum to the public. In 1966, the Dallas County Conservation Department purchased the site, and has subsequently added another 12 acres (49,000 m²) of re-established prairie and wildflowers. The museum displays unique artifacts; including a presidential autograph collection, a high quality Iowa book collection and the giant electric generator built by noted inventor Henry Nelson. Live animals and an increasing number of hands on family exhibits are also featured at the facility. The arboretum contains over 100 species of primarily native trees and shrubs.

Owned by Good Karma Brands, WKNR is the main Cleveland affiliate for ESPN Radio, and along with sister station WWGK forms a duopoly branded ESPN Cleveland. WKNR serves as a co-flagship station for the Cleveland Browns Radio Network; the Cleveland affiliate for the Ohio State Sports Network; and the radio home of Je'Rod Cherry and Tony Grossi. The WKNR studios are located in the Galleria at Erieview in Downtown Cleveland, while the station transmitter resides in the Cleveland suburb of North Royalton. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WKNR is available online. Historically, the station is perhaps best known by its former WJW call letters. During the early 1950s, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began to popularize the term \\"rock and roll\\" as a name for the music genre both through his late night WJW radio show, and by what is often considered the first major rock and roll concert: the WJW-sponsored Moondog Coronation Ball.Gillett, Charlie, The Sound of the City (1970). p. 15 History =WJW (AM)=  Early years  WKNR began broadcasting as WLBV in Mansfield, Ohio on November 13, 1926 under the ownership of John F. Weimer. In 1928 the call letters were changed to WJW, reflecting the owner's initials. In 1933 the station was sold to Mansfield Broadcasting Association, and it was broadcasting at 1210 kHz with 100 watts. WJW moved to Akron in 1932. By 1936, the station was owned by WJW, Inc., with studios located at 41 South High Street. On March 29, 1941, WJW, like most stations around the country changed its frequency with the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. As of 1942, the station was broadcasting with 250 watts at 1240 kHz. William M. O'Neil, Jr. purchased WJW on June 25, 1940 for $41,500; O'Neil was the son of William F. O'Neil, president of Akron-based General Tire and Rubber Co.—which also entered broadcasting in 1943 with the purchase of a station group in New England—but operated WJW independently from the tire manufacturer. O'Neil applied to move WJW's operations and transmitter facility to Cleveland in late October 1942, utilizing an existing construction permit for a full-time station in Cleveland at 850 kHz with 5,000 watts fulltime. By June 1943, O'Neil also applied for a replacement station in Akron using WJW's existing 1240 kHz facilities and the call letters WAJV concurrent with a proposed sale to a third party, that request was denied that December.  Move to Cleveland  WJW formally moved to Cleveland on November 13, 1943, operating at 850 kHz; it became an affiliate of the Blue Network—soon to be the ABC Radio Network—two days later. Marvin Cade signed on the station that Saturday and was the evening news announcer. Competing station WGAR (1480 AM) collaborated with WJW for a special broadcast on both stations the day of the move, WGAR also took out advertisements in Cleveland's three daily newspapers \\"welcoming\\" the station into Cleveland. With facilities in the Guardian Building (now the National City–East 6th Building at 619 Euclid), WJW became Cleveland's fifth radio station after co-owned WHK and WCLE, WTAM and WGAR; the number of stations would be reduced back to four in May 1945 when WCLE moved their station operations to Akron as WHKK. With its Blue Network affiliation, WJW also brought the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, a staple of the Blue Network/ABC's lineup, to Cleveland. The station also featured news commentary by Dorothy Fuldheim prior to her long tenure at WEWS- TV; and from May 1951 to early 1953, was home to a disc jockey called Soupy Hines, later known as Soupy Sales. WJW opened an FM outlet, WJW-FM (104.1), in 1948. The new FM station went on the air just as the Cleveland Indians began their world championship season. WJW was the flagship of a six-station Ohio network that carried the games in 1947 and 1948, a precursor to the current Cleveland Indians Radio Network. However, the full games were often carried on WJW-FM, since the AM outlet did not have available air time due to its ABC network commitments. As a result, Cleveland became an FM hot bed, and more FM radio sets sold in Cleveland than in any other market in the country in 1948; a 14-station extension of the Indians Radio Network, The Standard Network, was soon established with WJW-FM as its flagship. O'Neil sold WJW and WJW-FM to Storer Broadcasting on November 17, 1954. Storer also purchased television station WXEL and changed the call letters to WJW-TV. Within two years, radio and television operations were consolidated at new studios at 1630 Euclid Avenue, near Playhouse Square, in a remodeled Georgian building that formerly housed the Esquire Theater. WJW dropped its ABC Radio Network affiliation at the end of 1957 and became an independent station, although the station later had a brief affiliation with NBC before becoming independent again. By 1959, WJW broadcast with 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts at night, which would last for the next forty years. Alan Freed A young disc jockey named Alan Freed joined WJW in 1951 from WAKR in Akron, Ohio. Shortly thereafter, Alan began making broadcasting history with his shows in which he was known as the \\"Moondog.\\" Freed played rhythm-and-blues music by black artists for a largely white teen-age audience. He is purported to have given the music the name by which it is known today - rock and roll. In addition to his radio program, Freed also organized local concerts by early rock artists, called the Moondog Coronation Ball, which many consider to be the first rock concert in American history. The concert on March 21, 1952 at the Cleveland Arena turned into a riot when far too many listeners filled the hall, causing Freed to apologize on the air the next day. Freed left WJW in September 1954 for WINS New York, but he had established WJW as the premier rock and roll outlet. Pete \\"Mad Daddy\\" Myers In January 1958, Pete \\"Mad Daddy\\" Myers joined the station from WHKK 640 AM in Akron. His \\"Mad Daddy\\" persona later was adapted by Ernie Anderson for his \\"Ghoulardi\\" character on sister station WJW- TV in 1963. Myers' show was heard nightly from 8 pm to 12:30 am. Myers had a brief but meteoric career at WJW, lasting only until May 13, 1958, when he resigned to go to Metromedia's WHK which was establishing itself as the new Top 40 powerhouse in Cleveland. WJW enforced a 90-day noncompete clause, and \\"Mad Daddy\\" could not be heard on WHK until August 10. To keep his name in front of the public while he was off the air, Myers concocted a publicity stunt on June 14, 1958, parachuting from a Piper Cub 2200 feet over Lake Erie, and composing a poem on his way down. He was fished out the waters shortly thereafter, and handed out copies of the 45 record \\"Zorro\\" to hundreds of fans who greeted him when he got to shore. Some initial reports of the stunt incorrectly stated that Myers did not survive the jump, but they were quickly revised. \\"Mad Daddy\\" reached the peak of his popularity at WHK, hosting record hops and live after-midnight shows dressed in a Dracula costume. In July 1959 he moved to WHK's sister station in New York, WNEW 1130 AM, where \\"Mad Daddy\\" was not well received. He played it straight as Pete Myers there until 1963, when he moved to WINS and resumed the \\"Mad Daddy Show.\\" This show was syndicated to other stations until WINS changed format to all-news in 1965. As again just Pete Myers, he returned to WNEW once more. Myers lived until October 4, 1968, when he took his own life in New York City, shortly after he had been informed that his show was to be moved from afternoons to evenings at WNEW. Later years After losing both Freed and Myers in successive fashion, WJW turned to a young Casey Kasem, then known on-air as \\"Casey at the Mike\\", for the evening shift. With both WHK and KYW on the rise, however, WJW abandoned its rock and roll format in the spring of 1960, settling into a format featuring news, talk and middle-of-the-road music. Among the personalities heard on WJW during this time was longtime morning host Ed Fisher, in addition to Carl Reese, Ted Lux and David Mark. Between 1973 and 1974, WJW also featured an afternoon drive music and talk show hosted by a young Ronn Owens, who would later find success at KGO (AM) in San Francisco. In 1968, Storer changed WJW-FM's call letters to become WCJW, then spun off that station in 1971 as WQAL, which it continues to operate as to this day. Early 1980s logo as WJW Storer sold WJW radio in early September 1976 to Lake Erie Broadcasting for $2.5 million; the deal was consummated in July 1977. Lake Erie Broadcasting was headed primarily by Cleveland Browns owners Art Modell and Al Lerner, with WEWS sportscaster Gib Shanley as minority owner. Storer retained WJW-TV, whose calls were changed to WJKW the following April 22. The new ownership group, under General Manager Richard Bremkamp and Program Director Dick Conrad, continued the format - then known on-air as - highlighting talk shows and adult popular music. The middle-of-the-road format would be abandoned entirely in favor of news/talk on June 1982. Lake Erie Broadcasting sold WJW to Booth American for $2.1 million in early 1985, while simultaneously purchasing WWWE and WDOK from Gannett for $9.5 million. In the process, Lake Erie reassigned all on and off-air personnel to WWWE, and changed WWWE's format to the news/talk format previously heard on WJW, while inheriting WWWE's existing sports play-by-play and Pete Franklin's Sportsline. As a condition of the prior sale from Storer, the WJW calls were exchanged in favor of WRMR at 11:00 a.m. on June 11, 1985; Marvin Cade was invited to sign off WJW for the final time before the callsign change, thus giving him the distinction of being both the first - and last - voice heard on WJW during its time in Cleveland. With the abandonment of the historic three-letter call sign by the AM outlet, the television station was able to change its call letters from WJKW back to WJW-TV (which it did on September 16 of the same year). =WRMR (850 AM)= Station logo as WRMR; also includes the Music of Your Life logo Under the ownership of Booth Broadcasting, the new music format for WRMR was initially middle of the road, aimed at the 40- to 49-year-old age group. In 1988, Booth Broadcasting convinced programmer Jim Davis - formerly of WWWE and WBBG - to return to the Cleveland airwaves with his version of the \\"Music of Your Life\\". The Davis mixture of 1940s, 50s and 60s ballads, standards, big band tunes and Broadway and Movie Musicals, including newer artists like Harry Connick, Jr. and Diana Krall, proved successful. Davis himself served as both program director and an on-air host. Independent Group Ltd.—owned by Tom Embrescia, Tom Wilson and Larry Pollock—and Booth American swapped AM licenses for an undisclosed amount in late December 1989; on June 25, 1990, Independent Group Ltd. took over WRMR (850 AM), and Booth American took over WWWE, with some on- and off-air personnel being reassigned between the two stations. During this period Davis, also serving as the Director of Operations for the nationally syndicated Al Ham \\"Music of Your Life\\" format (1991-96), brought such legendary personalities as Bill Randle, Carl Reese, Ted Hallaman and Ronnie Barrett into the on-air talent stable. Davis left the station in the spring of 1996. On May 15, 1999, WRMR upgraded its daytime signal to 50,000 watts with a new transmitter pattern built at the old WJW/WRMR site in North Royalton. The station's daytime signal remains present in much of northern Ohio, though the station must protect the signal of WKGE 850-AM in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, impairing the signal to the south and as close in as Cuyahoga Falls and Akron. On August 12, 1998, Chancellor Media Corporation of Texas announced the purchase of WRMR and WDOK from Independent Group Ltd., along with five other Cleveland radio stations - WZJM, WZAK, WQAL, - all for $275 million. This was, at the time, the largest deal in Cleveland radio history. On July 13, 1999, Chancellor Media merged with owner Capstar Broadcasting to form AMFM, Inc.; the new company was, for a time, the nation's largest owner of radio stations with 465. On July 20, 2000, as part of a required divestiture following AMFM, Inc.'s merger with Clear Channel Communications, WRMR and were sold to Salem Communications; and WDOK was sold to Infinity Broadcasting Corporation (now CBS Radio). Under Salem ownership, Jim Davis returned to WRMR to head programming, as well as an on-air shift. WRMR started to segue into playing more contemporary ballads, billed as \\"easy-listening oldies.\\" WRMR also started to air long blocks of brokered talk shows in the evenings and weekends, most of which were carried over from brokered talk station . =2001 \\"frequency swap\\"= On July 3, 2001, WRMR was one of seven Northeast Ohio radio stations involved in a complex exchange between three radio companies. Although generally reported as a \\"frequency swap\\", in reality these seven radio stations mostly traded callsigns along with their respective formats and staffs - all to facilitate the transfers of ownership of four of the seven stations. As part of this complex exchange, Salem Communications changed the WRMR callsign to WKNR; changed the station's format to sports radio; rebranded the station SportsTalk 850 AM; and reassigned on- and off-air staff. In effect, this new WKNR (850 AM) licensed to Cleveland became the successor to the previous WKNR (1220 AM) licensed to Cleveland. = WKNR (2001-present) = Sportstalk 850 AM Much of the WRMR brokered talk programming remained for the next several months. Soon, however, the local new WKNR on-air hosts included the midday team of Greg Brinda and Kendall Lewis; Kenny Roda; Bruce Drennan; the late John Antus; Bob Karlovec; and Ken Silverstein. The station's program director at the time was Steve Legurski, who had held the same post at from 1999 to 2001. A series of budget cutbacks by Salem in January 2004 led to the dismissal of Brinda, Lewis, Silverstein, Legurski and several other staffers, with Micheal Luczak taking over as program director. Bruce Drennan was reassigned to the midday slot, while ESPN Radio's flagship program Mike and Mike in the Morning took Drennan's place. Greg Brinda was then brought back to the station one week after his dismissal to do fill-in work and host several specialty shows, but wound up taking Drennan's slot following his sudden departure in October 2004. A number of divestitures and format changes with other Salem-owned sports talk stations in the past few years (such as WBOB in Cincinnati and KHHO in Tacoma, which was LMA'ed to Clear Channel) left WKNR the only remaining sports station in Salem Communications' portfolio. In July 2006, ESPN Radio cancelled its affiliation with WKNR with a 90-day notice effective that October 8, following Beaver Dam, Wisconsin-based Good Karma Broadcasting's purchase of WABQ and new affiliation deal. With that change, WKNR then became the Cleveland affiliate for Fox Sports Radio that October, while WABQ relaunched as \\"ESPN Radio 1540\\" WWGK. Several weeks later, Good Karma would end up purchasing WKNR for $7 million weeks later on December 4, 2006, which now formed a two-station duopoly. A local marketing agreement immediately began for WKNR, with the deal officially being closed in January 2007. ESPN Cleveland 2000s logo for WKNR before being consolidated under the ESPN Cleveland banner On February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation and be rebranded as ESPN 850 WKNR. As a result, Fox Sports Radio then switched over to WWGK. Since then, the station made a series of schedule overhauls, adding now former longtime WJW-TV sports director (and former WHK show host) and Tony Rizzo in the late morning slot, former WMMS/WMJI sports director Mark \\"Munch\\" Bishop in afternoon drive, and former Cavaliers TV play- by-play voice Michael Reghi to host their post-game call in show. On July 6, 2010, Former Buckeye and Brown LeCharles Bentley and former Super Bowl winner Je'Rod Cherry were added as co-hosts of the evening show. On July 29, 2011, WKNR announced a partnership with the Browns to air the team produced Cleveland Browns Daily. Two years later, AM 850 became the AM flagship station for the team. On March 12, 2012, WKNR hired former longtime Plain Dealer Browns beat writer Tony Grossi to be their Browns beat reporter. He appears on all local programming as an analyst, writes for the station's website, and covers all the team's games (home and away). On October 10, 2014, WKNR announced that they had signed former Plain Dealer and Akron Beacon Journal Cavaliers beat reporter, and current ESPN NBA insider Brian Windhorst to be their Cavs beat reporter and analyst.Windhorst joins WKNR - ESPN Cleveland.com The studios for WKNR and WWGK were officially moved from WKNR's former transmitter site in Broadview Heights, Ohio on October 29, 2007 under a $500,000 combined facility at The Galleria at Erieview, effectively ending 30 years of continuous use by WKNR, WKNR (1220 AM) and by WGAR (1220 AM).

We have recorded each composition with the one > thought – that it should be unique, adventurous and fascinating. It has > taken every shred of our combined musical and technical knowledge to achieve > this. From the outset we have abandoned all preconceived thoughts of blatant > commercialism.

It was founded on 10 November 1884 under the name \\"Archdiocese of Carthage\\", with territory corresponding to that of the then French protectorate of Tunisia. On 9 July 1964, it became a territorial prelature under the ecclesiastical title of Prelature of Tunis. It was made a diocese, keeping the name of Tunis, on 31 May 1995, and raised to the rank of archdiocese on 22 May 2010.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 759 The Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul is the cathedral of the archdiocese of Tunis.  History  = Background: ancient see of Carthage = The ancient see of Carthage, which is now a titular see,Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 860 was much less extensive than the archdiocese of Tunis. The territory of the archdiocese is coterminous with that of Tunisia, and thus corresponds approximately to that of the entire Roman provinces of Africa Proconsularis (Zeugitana) and Byzacena. The ancient diocese was only one of many bishoprics within the former of these Roman provinces. On the other hand, the archdiocese does not enjoy the influence that the ancient diocese had over a large number of bishoprics in an area, encompassing not only today's Tunisia but also much of Algeria. =Apostolic prefecture= In 1684, Pope Urban VIII established an apostolic prefecture at Tunis for Ottoman Tunisia, which Pope Gregory XVI raised to the rank of an apostolic vicariate in 1843. =Apostolic administration= In 1881, Tunisia became a French protectorate, and in the same year Charles Lavigerie, who was archbishop of Algiers, became apostolic administrator of the vicariate of Tunis. In the following year, Lavigerie became a cardinal. He \\"saw himself as the reviver of the ancient Christian Church of Africa, the Church of Cyprian of Carthage\\", and, on 10 November 1884, was successful in his great ambition of having the metropolitan see of Carthage restored, with himself as its first archbishop. In 1053, Pope Leo IX settled a dispute about primacy in the Roman province of Africa between the bishops of Carthage and Gummi by declaring that, after the Bishop of Rome, the first archbishop and chief metropolitan of the whole of Africa is the bishop of Carthage nor can he, for the benefit of any bishop in the whole of Africa, lose the privilege received once for all from the holy Roman and apostolic see, but he will hold it until the end of the world as long as the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is invoked there, whether Carthage lie desolate or whether it some day rise glorious again.\\"Patrologia Latina, vol. 143, coll. 727–731 In line with this, Pope Leo XIII acknowledged the revived Archdiocese of Carthage as the primatial see of Africa and Lavigerie as primate.Joseph Sollier, \\"Charles-Martial-Allemand Lavigerie\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) (The statement by Auguste Boudinhon that the acknowledgement was made in 1893, the year after Lavigerie's death, if not mistaken, is a reference to some renewed recognition.) From then until 1964, the Annuario Pontificio presented the see of Carthage as \\"founded in the 3rd century, metropolitan see of Proconsularis or Zeugitana, restored as archbishopric 10 November 1884\\". In July 1964, pressure from President Habib Bourguiba's government of the Republic of Tunisia, which was in a position to close down all the Catholic churches in the country, forced the Holy See to abide by a modus vivendi bilateral agreement which regulated its legal status according to the 1959 Constitution of Tunisia. The modus vivendi gave the Catholic Church in Tunisia legal personality and stated that it was legally represented by the prelate nullius of Tunis. The Holy See chose the prelate nullius but the government could object against the candidate before an appointment. The modus vivendi banned the Catholic Church from any political activity in Tunisia. This particular agreement was unofficially described as instead a modus non moriendi (\\"a way of not dying\\"). By it, all but five of the country's more than seventy churches were handed over to the state, including what had been the cathedral of the archdiocese, while the state, for its part, promised that the buildings would be put only to use of public interest consonant with their previous function. Pope Paul VI suppressed the Archdiocese of Carthage and erected the Prelature nullius of Tunis, in his 1964 apostolic constitution Prudens Ecclesiae, to conform to the bilateral agreement. From The Archdiocese of Carthage reverted to the status of a titular see. The residential archdiocese's territory became that of the Territorial Prelature of Tunis, established on 9 July 1964. The first archbishop of the titular see, Agostino Casaroli, was appointed on 4 July 1967. The Annuario Pontificio of that period described the titular archiepiscopal see of Carthage as \\"founded in the 3rd century, metropolitan see of Proconsularis or Zeugitana, restored as an archiepiscopal see on 10 November 1884, titular archbishopric 9 July 1964\\". The history of the territorial prelature was given as \\"founded 9 July 1964, previously an archbishopric under the name of Carthage founded 10 November 1884\\". What was the cathedral of the archdiocese of Carthage, the Saint Louis Cathedral (Carthage), is owned by the Tunisian state and is used for concerts. =Diocese= The prelature was elevated to an exempt diocese, directly subject to the Holy See, in 1995. From In 2010, it was promoted to an exempt archdiocese. From The summary of the history of the residential archdiocese of Tunis now given in the Annuario Pontificio is: \\"archbishopric under the name of Carthage 10 November 1884; Prelature of Tunis 9 July 1964; diocese 31 May 1995; archbishopric 22 May 2010.\\" The ancient see of Carthage, on the other hand, being no longer a residential bishopric, is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see in the same publication as distinct from the modern see of Tunis. As a summary history of the titular see of Carthage it states: \\"founded in the 3rd century, metropolitan see of Proconsularis or Zeugitana, restored as an archiepiscopal see on 10 November 1884, titular metropolitan see 9 July 1964\\".

Biography A 19th century medallion of Paolo Frisi on the facade of Palazzo Beccaria in via Brera street, Milan (birthplace of Cesare Beccaria). Frisi was born in Melegnano in 1728; his sibling Antonio Francesco, born in 1735, went on to be a historian.Antinio Frisi, Cassiciaco.it, Retrieved 27 August 2015 Frisi was educated at the local Barnabite monastery and afterwards in that of Padua. When twenty-one years of age he composed a treatise on the figure of the earth, and the reputation which he soon acquired led to his appointment by the King of Sardinia to the professorship of philosophy in the College of Casale. His friendship with Radicati, a man of liberal opinions, occasioned Frisis removal by his clerical superiors to Novara, where he was compelled to do duty as a preacher. In 1753 he was elected a corresponding member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, and shortly afterwards he became professor of philosophy in the Barnabite College of St Alexander at Milan. An acrimonious attack by a young Jesuit, about this time, upon his dissertation on the figure of the earth laid the foundation of his animosity against the Jesuits, with whose enemies, including Jean d'Alembert, J.

From several European crowned heads he received, at various times, marks of special distinction, and the empress Maria Theresa granted him a yearly pension of 100 sequins. In 1764 he was created professor of mathematics in the palatine schools at Milan, and obtained from Pope Pius VI the release from ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and authority to become a secular priest. In 1766 he visited France and England, and in 1768 Vienna. His knowledge of hydraulics caused him to be frequently consulted with respect to the management of canals and other watercourses in various parts of Europe. It was through his means that lightning conductors were first introduced into Italy for the protection of buildings.

Foster she coauthors the textbook, Microbiology: An Evolving Science (W. W. Norton). She explores her ideas of biology, politics, and artificial intelligence at her blog Ultraphyte. Biography Slonczewski was born in 1956 at Hyde Park, New York and raised in Katonah, New York. She earned an A.B. in biology, magna cum laude, from Bryn Mawr College in 1977. She completed a PhD in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University in 1982 and post-doctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania studying calcium flux in leukocyte chemotaxis. Since 1984 she has taught at Kenyon College, taking sabbatical leaves at Princeton University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Slonczewski's research focuses on the pH (environmental) stress response in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis using genetic techniques. Slonczewski teaches both biology and science fiction courses. From 1996 through 2008, she has been awarded Howard Hughes Medical Institute funding for undergraduate biological sciences education, which she uses to improve science instruction and to foster summer science fellowships for minority and first-generation students. She was the Hal Clement Science Speaker in February 2011 at the Boskone 48 convention. Slonczewski is also a member of the Quakers and Quakerism is featured in many of her novels. Fiction Her 1986 Campbell Award-winning novel A Door into Ocean shows her command of genetics and ecological science, as well as her commitment to pacifism and feminism. It depicts the ecosystem of a planet covered entirely by water, inhabited by an exclusively female race of genetic engineers. Daughters of Elysium (1993), The Children Star (1998), and Brain Plague (2000) are loose sequels. A serialization of her The Children Star (1998) appeared in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, a magazine known for hard science fiction. Brain Plague (2000) depicts a world where intelligent microbes inhabit human brains. The microbial aliens have potential for great good as well as great evil. They evolve in the same way as pathogens such as HIV or as symbionts such as our digestive bacteria, which help keep humans healthy. Brain Plague tells of a future in which genetic engineering, combined with nanotechnology can do everything from shaping our bodies to growing enormous buildings for us. \\"One time in class, my students were discussing my book Brain Plague.

The year is 2108 and Jenny is attending Frontera College, which is located in a space habitation. The earth is being destroyed by human-made ecological catastrophes blamed on the \\"ultraphytes,\\" UV-photosynthetic plant-animals from outer space. Some political factions are promoting space habitats as a solution, but the spacehabs can only accommodate a tiny percentage of the human population. The political system is grid locked. The Highest Frontier addresses political, social, and environmental issues. Mitochondrial Singularity Slonczewski invented the concept of the Mitochondrial Singularity, the idea that the technological singularity is happening gradually; that humans are gradually becoming the \\"mitochondria of our own machines.\\" She explores these concepts in her novels Brain Plague and The Highest Frontier.

A mesoscale convective system's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape, and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, lake-effect snow events, polar lows, and Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs), and generally forms near weather fronts. The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America, Europe, and Asia, with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours. Forms of MCS that develop within the tropics use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon troughs as a focus for their development, generally within the warm season between spring and fall. One exception is that of lake-effect snow bands, which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water, and occurs from fall through spring. Polar lows are a second special class of MCS which form at high latitudes during the cold season. Once the parent MCS dies, later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex (MCV). Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall. Definition Mesoscale convective systems are thunderstorm regions which may be round or linear in shape, on the order of or more across in one direction but smaller than extratropical cyclones, and include systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, and Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs), among others. MCS is a more generalized term which includes systems that do not satisfy the stricter size, shape, or duration criteria of an MCC. They tend to form near weather fronts and move into areas of 1000-500 mb thickness diffluence, which are areas where the low to mid level temperature gradient broadens, which generally steers the thunderstorm clusters into the warm sector of extratropical cyclones, or equatorward of warm fronts. They can also form along any convergent zones within the tropics. A recent study found that they tend to form when the surface temperature varies with more than 5 degrees between day and night . Their formation has been noted worldwide, from the Mei-Yu front in the far East to the deep tropics.University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (1996-12-30). Physics of Mesoscale Weather Systems.

Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall. Thunderstorm types and levels of organization Conditions favorable for thunderstorm types and complexes There are four main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell. Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere (\\"wind shear\\"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes. Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of sufficient moisture, significant vertical wind shear (normally greater than in the lowest of the troposphere)Markowski, Paul and Yvette Richardson. Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2010. pp. 209.), which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation. Precipitable water values of greater than favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes.Maddox, R.A., C.F. Chappell, and L.R. Hoxit, (1979).

Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2010. pp. 215, 310. Types =Mesoscale convective complex= A mesoscale convective complex (MCC) is a unique kind of mesoscale convective system which is defined by characteristics observed in infrared satellite imagery. Their area of cold cloud tops exceeds with temperature less than or equal to ; and an area of cloud top of with temperature less than or equal to . Size definitions must be met for six hours or greater. Its maximum extent is defined as when the cloud shield, or the overall cloud formation, reaches its maximum area. Its eccentricity (minor axis/major axis) is greater than or equal to 0.7 at maximum extent, so they are fairly round. They are long-lived, nocturnal in formation as they tend to form overnight, and commonly contain heavy rainfall, wind, hail, lightning and possibly tornadoes. =Squall line= mesoscale convective vortex over Pennsylvania with a trailing squall line. A squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and/or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term was used as a synonym for cold front. The squall line contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Severe weather, in form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo, within the portion of the line which bows out the most. Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP, where mesoscale low pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes that develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can form, which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy, which are sometimes associated with a heat burst. Another term that may be used in association with squall line and bow echoes is quasi- linear convective systems (QLCSs). =Tropical cyclone= Hurricane Catarina, a rare South Atlantic tropical cyclone viewed from the International Space Station on March 26, 2004 A tropical cyclone is a fairly symmetric storm system characterized by a low pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain. A tropical cyclone feeds on the heat released when moist air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air. It is fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters, European windstorms, and polar lows, leading to their classification as \\"warm core\\" storm systems. The term \\"tropical\\" refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form often in tropical regions of the globe, and their formation in Maritime Tropical air masses. The term \\"cyclone\\" refers to such storms' cyclonic nature, with counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply as a cyclone. Generally speaking, a tropical cyclone is referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan) in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, a typhoon across the northwest Pacific ocean, and a cyclone across in the southern hemisphere and Indian ocean. Tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, as well as high waves and damaging storm surge. They develop over large bodies of warm water, and lose their strength if they move over land.National Hurricane Center (2009-02-06). Subject : C2) Doesn't the friction over land kill tropical cyclones? Retrieved on 2009-06-15. This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2005 Tropical Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Outlook. Retrieved on 2006-05-02. They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes, which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism. As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's troposphere. Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become a subtropical cyclone during its extratropical transition. =Lake-effect snow= Lake-effect precipitation coming off Lake Erie, as seen by NEXRAD radar, October 12–13, 2006 Lake-effect snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water, providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores. The same effect over bodies of salt water is called ocean effect snow, sea effect snow, or even bay effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow, but very intense bands of precipitation, which is deposited at a rate of many inches of snow per hour and often brings copious snowfall totals. The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts. This effect occurs in many locations throughout the world, but is best known in the populated areas of the Great Lakes of North America. If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen, it falls as lake-effect rain. In order for lake-effect rain or snow to form, the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air (which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface). Specifically, the air temperature at the altitude where the air pressure is 850 millibars (or altitude) should be 13 °C (24 °F) lower than the temperature of the air at the surface. Lake-effect occurring when the air at 850 millibars is 25 °C (45 °F) colder than the water temperature can produce thundersnow, snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder (due to the larger amount of energy available from the increased instability).Jack Williams (2006-05-05). Warm water helps create Great Lakes snowstorms. USA Today. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. =Polar low= A polar low is a small-scale, symmetric, short- lived atmospheric low pressure system (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than and exist for no more than a couple of days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least .Rasmussen, E.A. and Turner, J. (2003).

Dashed line indicates axis of greatest potential for downbursts. Arrows indicate wind flow relative to the storm. Area C is most prone to supporting tornado development. The time period in the Plains where thunderstorm areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. Mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time.

Retrieved on 2008-03-02. =Tropics= Mesoscale convective systems, which can evolve into tropical cyclones, form along areas such as tropical waves or easterly waves which progress westward along monsoon troughs and the Intertropical Convergence Zone in regions of ample low level moisture, convergent surface winds, and divergent winds aloft. This typically occurs north of the equator from Africa across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, as well as across the northwest and southwest Pacific oceans, from Australia eastward into Oceania, the Indian ocean, Indonesia, and from southeast Brazil into the southern Atlantic ocean. It is also noted on occasion in the southeast Pacific ocean mild to cool ENSO years, outside of El Niño. More intense systems form over land than water. =Lee of warm water bodies in the winter= In the cases of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the convective systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads to an increase in moisture and significant vertical motion. This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones. Their remnants A mesoscale convective vortex--(MCV)--is a mid-level low-pressure center within an MCS that pulls winds into a circling pattern, or vortex. Once the parent MCS dies, this vortex can persist and lead to future convective development. With a core only to and up to deep, an MCV can occasionally spawn a mesoscale surface low pressure area which appears on mesoscale surface weather analyses. But an MCV can take on a life of its own, persisting for up to several days after its parent MCS has dissipated. The orphaned MCV will sometimes then become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak. An MCV that moves into tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane.

In 1943 he succeeded Prof. Ui and was appointed Associate Professor of Tokyo Imperial University. He was a professor there from 1954 to 1973. After retiring from Tokyo University, he established Toho Gakuin (The Eastern Institute, Inc.) and lectured on philosophy to the general public. Academic studies Nakamura was an expert on Sanskrit and Pali, and among his many writings are commentaries on Buddhist scriptures. He is most known in Japan as the first to translate the entire Pali Tripitaka into Japanese. This work is still considered the definitive translation to date against which later translations are measured. The footnotes in his Pali translation often refer to other previous translations in German, English, French as well as the ancient Chinese translations of Sanskrit scriptures. Because of his meticulous approach to translation he had a dominating and lasting influence in the study of Indic philosophy in Japan at a time when it was establishing itself throughout the major Japanese universities. He also indirectly influenced the secular scholastic study of Buddhism throughout Eastern and Southern Asia, especially Taiwan and Korea. Japan, Korea, Taiwan and recently China is the only area in which all major scriptural languages of Buddhism (Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit and Pali) are taught and studied by academics of Indic philosophy. Nakamura was influenced by the Indian philosophy of Buddhism, Chinese, Japanese and Western thought. He made remarks on the problem of bioethics.

The Brewers Association currently ranks the American arm of Boulevard's parent company, Duvel Moortgat USA, as the 12th largest craft brewery, and the 18th largest active brewery in the United States based on 2014 sales volume. Before the sale of Anheuser-Busch to InBev in 2008, Boulevard was the largest independent American brewery in the state of Missouri. Boulevard's beers are available in select markets across the United States and Canada. In 2013, Boulevard was acquired by Duvel Moortgat Brewery.Belgian Brewery Buys Boulevard, a U.S. Craft Beer Maker Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but industry publication Beer Business Daily estimated the sale price exceeds $100 million. History Boulevard Brewing Company started with this 35 barrel hopper. Boulevard Brewery's bottling line is turned off in this photo. Boulevard began in 1988 when founder John McDonald started construction of the brewery in a turn-of-the-century brick building on Kansas City’s historic Southwest Boulevard. A vintage Bavarian brewhouse was installed with used equipment from a closed brewery in Bavaria, Germany, and the first batches of beer were produced in the fall of 1989. Based on the historic example set by the local and regional breweries that were once common throughout the United States prior to Prohibition, the brewery has a focus on providing locally- brewed beer for the Kansas City region. The brewery's first half-barrel of Boulevard Pale Ale was delivered personally by McDonald in his pickup truck to Ponak's Mexican Kitchen, located nearby. In 1990, Boulevard Wheat was added to the product line. Wheat and Pale Ale remain the company’s strongest sellers. Introduced in late 2007, the \\"Smokestack Series\\" joined Boulevard's family of beers with year-round, seasonal, and limited edition lines of artisanal selections packaged mostly in 750 ml bottles, while some are also available in 12 oz. bottles and on draft. These bold, complex varieties were inspired by Belgian Trappist beer, and share several characteristics including their higher alcohol content. Year-round Smokestack beers include The Calling double ipa, Long Strange Tripel, The Sixth Glass quadrupel, Dark Truth Stout, Tell- Tale Tart a slightly sour ale, and Tank 7, a farmhouse ale. Additional Smokestack beers have been released, including some limited release and some that are available year-round. In mid-2009, the company introduced Boulevard Pilsner to its core brand family. The brew is a nod to the full-bodied pilsners of Kansas City's historic breweries of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the spring of 2013, Boulevard Pilsner was rebranded to KC Pils. In 2018, Boulevard teamed with Kansas City native and rapper Tech N9ne to create a new beer. The beer, which is named Bou Lou and is a wheat beer with pineapple and coconut flavors, is named for and inspired by his song \\"Caribou Lou\\". It was released on June 18 in Kansas City, Wichita, Denver, and Oklahoma City and on July 9 in St. Louis. With capacity reaching an estimated 600,000 barrels from an expansion project completed in 2006, the brewery is now one of the largest craft brewers in the Midwest. In the U.S., Boulevard Beer is available in 41 states.

In 2013, many of the brewery's beers were certified kosher by the Vaad HaKashruth of Kansas City. Brewery expansion Boulevard underwent expansions in 1999 and 2005. In March 2006, Boulevard broke ground on a $20 million expansion project that increases brewing production capacity by an estimated 60,000 barrels/year. The new brewing and packaging building was constructed adjacent to the existing plant. Designed by 360 Architecture, the new addition is and includes a two-story state-of-the- art brewhouse and a kegging/bottling facility with a skylit atrium. The third floor, in addition to housing Boulevard Brewery offices, has two large hospitality rooms, with a terrace overlooking downtown Kansas City. A glass skywalk links both pedestrian circulation and beer piping between the old and new brewhouses. The completed expansion facilitates the brewing of Boulevard's Unfiltered Wheat Beer and Pale Ale beers, which together comprise more than 60 percent of Boulevard's sales. Unfiltered Wheat Beer is the best-selling beer of its style in the Midwest. In Fall 2011 Boulevard began a $3 million expansion of its original brew house at 25th Street and Southwest Boulevard in Kansas City. The expansion required Boulevard to remove six 105-barrel fermenters in order to replace them with eight new 300-barrel fermentation tanks from the Paul Mueller Company of Springfield, Missouri. The expansion allowed the brewery to produce an additional 35,000 barrels of beer a year, increasing capacity by about 20 percent. In order to accommodate the new tanks, the original brew house at 25th Street and Southwest Boulevard needed to be raised about 35 feet. Boulevard offers daily tours where visitors may sample their brews.

His book, The Geology of Pennsylvania: A Government Survey (1858), was regarded as one of the most important publications on American geology issued up to that point. Biography Rogers was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 1 August 1808, the third of four sons of Patrick Kerr Rogers and Hannah Blythe Rogers. His parents were from Ireland, near Londonderry and emigrated to the United States where they first met and became married. Patrick Rogers was a supporter of militant efforts to end British rule in Ireland and was forced to flee to avoid persecution. Henry's middle name was given him in honour of Erasmus Darwin, of whose poem \\"The Botanic Garden\\" his father was a great admirer. In 1813 the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where Henry was educated in the public schools, and in 1819 they moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, where his father was professor of natural philosophy and mathematics in the College of William & Mary from 1819 until 1828, and which Henry attended for a short time. His father provided most of his education. After attending William and Mary, Henry worked at a school in Windsor, Maryland which he administered with his brother William Barton Rogers. It closed in 1828, and he joined his brother teaching at the Maryland Institute. At the age of 21, he was chosen professor of chemistry and natural philosophy at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania. During the year in which he held the professorship, he edited a monthly scientific magazine, The Messenger of Useful Knowledge, in which educational, literary, and political articles and selections from foreign journals were also published. His interest in the ideas of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi was not welcome at Dickinson and led to his dismissal in 1831. His interest in education reform led him to the British social reformer Robert Owen and his son Robert Dale Owen in New York. On their suggestion, in 1831 or 1832 he went to England, where, with aid afforded him by his brother William, he studied chemistry in the laboratory of Edward Turner, and attended other scientific lectures in London, including those of De la Beche on geology. He returned to Philadelphia in the summer of 1833, and in the ensuing winter delivered a course of lectures on geology in the hall of the Franklin Institute. Having received the degree of Master of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1834, he was elected professor of geology and mineralogy in that institution in 1835, where he remained until his resignation in 1846. In 1835 he was chosen to make a geological and mineralogical survey of New Jersey, and, in addition to a preliminary report in 1836, he published Description of the Geology of the State of New Jersey (Philadelphia, 1840). On the organisation of the geological survey of the state of Pennsylvania in 1836, he was appointed geologist in charge, and engaged in active field work until 1841, when the appropriations were discontinued. In 1842, he and his brother William, who was similarly occupied with a geological survey in Virginia (his reports were published in 1838 and 1841, and he wrote also on the connection between thermal springs and anticlinal axes and faults), brought before the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists their conclusions on the physical structure of the Appalachian chain, and on the elevation of great mountain chains. The researches of H. D. Rogers were elaborated in his final report on Pennsylvania, in which he included a general account of the geology of the United States and of the coal fields of North America and Great Britain. In this important work, he dealt also with the structure of the great coal fields, the method of formation of the strata, and the changes in the character of the coal from the bituminous type to anthracite. During the ten ensuing years, his services were retained as an expert by various coal companies. During this period – in 1846 – he moved to Boston. The field work of the Pennsylvania survey was resumed in 1851 and continued until 1854. Six annual reports were published between 1836 and 1842, and in 1855 the preparation of a final report was confided to him. Finding that the work could be done less expensively abroad, he transferred his residence to Edinburgh and issued The Geology of Pennsylvania, a Government Survey. The book, in two quarto volumes, contains 1682 pages, is illustrated by 778 woodcuts and diagrams in the text, 69 plates, and 18 folded sheets of sections, and was published by W. Blackwood & Sons (London and Edinburgh), and J. B. Lippincott & Co., Philadelphia, in 1858. In the final report Rogers included a general account of the geology of the United States and of the coal fields of North America and Great Britain. He also dealt with the structure of the great coal fields, the method of formation of the strata, and the changes in the character of the coal from the bituminous type to anthracite. In 1854 he married Elizabeth Stillman Lincoln. They had two children. In 1857 he was appointed Regius Professor of Natural History and Geology at Glasgow University. The same year he was also appointed as keeper of the Hunterian Museum and clerk to the trustees. One of his later essays (1861) was on the parallel 'roads' (geological terraces) of Lochaber (Glen Roy), the origin of which he attributed to a vast inundation. He died at 5 Elgin Villas in Shawlands, Glasgow in 1866 seemingly as a result of a combination of overwork, a weak constitution and the effect of the Glasgow climate. He was buried amongst Edinburgh's rich and famous in the south-east section of Dean Cemetery near the south path. Glasgow University appointed another geologist John Young to replace Rogers. Works Rogers published more than thirty important papers and reports, including the annual and final reports for his state surveys and reports on coal deposits for mining companies. * The Geology of Pennsylvania: A Government Survey (two volumes, 1858) Notes References * *Keppie, L. 2007.

Its seeds are known as tonka beans (sometimes tonkin beans or tonquin beans). They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth, brown interior. They have a strong fragrance similar to sweet woodruff due to their high content of coumarin. The word \\"tonka\\" is taken from the Galibi (Carib) tongue spoken by natives of French Guiana; it also appears in Tupi, another language of the same region, as the name of the tree. The old genus name, Coumarouna, was formed from another Tupi name for tree, kumarú. Biology of the tree The tree grows up to 25–30 meters, with a trunk of up to one meter in diameter.CRC handbook of alternative cash crops, page 238-239 The tree bark is smooth and gray, whereas the wood is red.Patricia Shanley, Murilo da Serra Silva, Tadeu Melo, Rachel Carmenta, Robert Nasi, 2012.

Forest Ecology and Management 268:70-80 The tree has alternate pinnate leaves with three to six leaflets, leathery, glossy and dark green, and pink flowers. Each developed fruit contains one seed. D. odorata is pollinated by insects. The worst pests are the bats because they eat the pulpy flesh of the fruit. A few known fungi may cause problems: Anthostomella abdita, Diatrype ruficarnis, Macrophoma calvuligera and Myiocopron cubense. Radio-carbon dating of D. odorata stumps left by a large logging operation near Manaus by Niro Higuchi, Jeffrey Chambers, and Joshua Schimel, showed that it was one of around 100 species which definitely live to over 1,000 years. Until their research, it had been assumed unlikely that any Amazonian tree could live to old age due to the conditions of the rain forest.Anna Lewington and Edward Parker, Ancient Trees: Trees that Live for a Thousand Years (Collins & Brown: London, 1999), p. 64 Seeds The tonka seed contains coumarin, a chemical isolate from this plant, which also gave the name to it. The seeds normally contain about 1 to 3% of coumarin, but rarely it can achieve 10%. Coumarin is responsible for the seed's pleasant odor and is used in the perfume industry. Coumarin is bitter to the taste, however, and, in large infused doses, it may cause hemorrhages, liver damage, or paralysis of the heart. It is therefore controlled as a food additive by many governments. Like a number of other plants, the tonka bean plant probably produces coumarin as a defense chemical. The smooth brown inside of the tonka bean Uses Tonka beans have been used as a source of natural coumarin, and, after its synthesis in 1940s, artificial coumarin became one of the first artificial flavoring agents as a vanilla substitute. However, the importation of natural tonka beans in the US has been banned by the FDA since 1954 because the bean has shown toxicity in extremely high concentrations. Since the ban, the product has been frequently imported illegally into the United States by gastronomic enthusiasts. There have been calls for removing the restrictions on the use of tonka beans in food in the U.S. similar to the successful deregulations of mangosteens and absinthe in the early 21st century; the regulations are criticized as unreasonable due to the unlikelihood of consuming enough coumarin to cause ill effects and due to the presence of coumarin in unregulated foods. In France, tonka beans are used in cuisine (particularly, in desserts and stews) and in perfumes. Yves Rocher uses them in their men's perfume Hoggar, for example. Many anticoagulant prescription drugs, such as warfarin, are based on 4-hydroxycoumarin, a chemical derivative of coumarin initially isolated from this bean. Coumarin, however, does not have anticoagulant properties.

Cumaru decking has a Class A fire-resistance rating, because it has a flame spread Index of 20.  Cultivation  Today, the main producers of tonka beans are Venezuela and Nigeria. The cumaru tree is an emergent plant, and a light-demanding calcifuge tree which grows on poor, well-drained soils. The best growth is reached on fertile soils rich in humus. In the native region there is a mean annual temperature of 25 °C and about 2000 mm rainfall per year with a dry season from June to November. Cristina Herrero-Jáuregui, Plinio Sist, Miguel A.

Forest Ecology and Management 208:31-39 In general, it has a very low plant density, but depending on the agricultural use, the density and the age of the trees diversify. In seed production systems, the plant density is higher and the trees are older than in timber production systems. The tree flowers from March to May, and the fruits ripen from June to July. So, the fresh fruits are picked up in June and July, and fallen pods are harvested from January to March or sometimes earlier. The hard outer shell is removed and the beans are spread out for 2–3 days to dry, after which they can be sold. The major producer is Venezuela, followed by Brazil and Colombia. The most important importing country is the United States, where it is used especially in the tobacco industry.  Social aspects  This species is well known locally and generates an important income for rural families, particularly as a buffer in times of hardship. It is used for timber and nontimber products, so it is crucial that the use of this resource occurs in a sustainable way. The yield of beans per tree is about 1.0–3.5 kg per year, but cumaru trees produce a large volume of seeds every four years.

From the Codex Claromontanus (5th or 6th century AD), Leaf 467v, National Library, Paris, France. Stichometry refers to the practice of counting lines in texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured the length of their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages. This practice was rediscovered by German and French scholars in the 19th century. Stichos (pl. stichoi) is the Greek word for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' is derived from the Greek word for measurement. The length of each line in the Iliad and Odyssey, which may have been among the first long, Greek texts written down, became the standard unit for ancient stichometry. This standard line (Normalzeile, in German) was thus as long as an epic hexameter and contained about 15 syllables or 35 Greek letters.Kurt Ohly, Stichometrische Untersuchungen (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928), ch. I. Stichometry existed for several reasons. Scribes were paid by the line and their fee per line was sometimes fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages in the works of other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts to check that copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total number of lines in each work along with the title and author.Ohly, Stichometrische Untersuchungen, ch. IV. Scholars believe that stichometry became established in Athens sometime during the 5th century BC when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in Plato's Laws (c. 347 BC),Plato, Laws, 958e9 – 959a1. See Ohly's analysis, p. 92-3. several times in Isocrates (early to mid-4th century),For example, Isocrates says in his prose Panathenaicus (136, c. 340 BC) that his composition is fit only for an audience that would countenance long speeches that even extended up ‘to a length of 10,000 hexameters.’ and in Theopompus (late 4th to early 3rd century),Theopompus (c. 380 – c. 315 BC) congratulated himself for writing display speeches of not less than 20,000 lines and then for writing another 150,000 lines about the relations of barbarians and Hellenes to each other. Photius Bibliotheca, cod. 176, p. 120b, fragment 30B = Fragments of Greek Historians, F 25. but these casual references suggest the practice was already routine. The same standard line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as page numbers became more common.Ohly, ch. IV. The decline of stichometry is also briefly discussed in Llewelyn Morgan, Patterns of Redemption in Virgil's Georgics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 224. The standard work on stichometry is Kurt Ohly's 1928 Stichometrische UntersuchungenKurt Ohly, Stichometrische Untersuchungen (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928). which collects together the results of some fifty years of scholarly debate and research. Today, stichometry plays a small but useful role in research in fields as diverse as the history of the ancient book, papyrology, and Christian hermeneutics. Definitions There are two kinds of stichometry: total stichometry is the practice of reporting the total number of lines in a work. Partial stichometry is the practice of including a series of numerals in the margins of a text, usually to mark every hundredth line. Stichometry was sometimes confused with colometry, the practice of some Christian authors in late antiquity of writing texts broken into rhetorical phrases to aid delivery. Some modern Jewish and Christian scholars use ‘stichometry’ as a synonym for ‘stichography,’ which is the occasional practice in ancient scriptures of laying out texts so that each biblical or poetic verse begins on a new line.Both terms are used in E. Tov, ‘The Background of the Different Stichometric Arrangements of Poetry in the Judean Desert Texts,’ in J. Penner, K. Penner, C. Wassen, editors, Prayer and Poetry in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature (Leiden: Brill Academic Publishing, 2011), pp. 409 -- 420. For the distinction, see James Kugel, The Idea of Biblical Poetry: Parallelism and Its History, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998). Evidence for stichometry palaeographer. His discovery of the standard line launched the rigorous, modern study of stichometry. The libraries of Europe contain many medieval copies of ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' on the final page that, in hundreds of cases, give the total number of lines in the work.There is a survey in Graux, ‘Nouvelles Recherches sur la Stichométrie,’ Revue de Philologie, new series 2, 1878, pp. 97 – 143. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period.See W. Larfeld, Griechische Epigraphik, 3rd edition, 1914. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.See Mirko Canevaro, The Documents in the Attic Orators (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013). Many ancient authors mention stichometry. Galen complains about the verbosity of a rival and says he can offer a description in fewer lines.Galen, Adversus eos qui de typis scripserunt (Köhn, vol. VII, pp. 475-512); see Ohly, p. 5. In the 1st century BC, a philosopher criticized Zeno of Citium and cited particular passages by giving their line number to the nearest hundredth line.Ohly (p. 109 ff.) argues the citations by line number in Diogenes Laërtius (VII 33, VII 188, etc.) derive from a 1st- century BC critic. Diogenes Laërtius probably draws on the Pinakes, the published catalogue of the Library of Alexandria, when he reports the total number of lines in the oeuvres of various authors. He says, for example, that Speusippus wrote 43,475, Aristotle wrote 445,270, and Theophrastus wrote 232,808 lines.Diogenes Laërtius, IV 5, V 27, and V 50. The Cheltenham Canon lists line totals for books in the Christian Bible and concludes with an anonymous note apparently written by a book dealer in the 4th century AD when the practice of stichometry was perhaps becoming less familiar: > Since the list of line totals [of the books in the Bible available] in the > city of Rome is not reliable, and elsewhere because of greed is not > complete, I have gone through each individual book, counting 16 syllables to > the line (as used in Virgil), and recorded the number for each book in all > of them.Sanday, ‘The Cheltenham List of the Canonical Books of the New > Testament and of the Writings of Cyprian,’ Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica, > III, Oxford, 1891, pp. 217-325. Beginning in the 19th century, archaeologists discovered a large number of more or less fragmentary Greek scrolls in Egypt. Ohly describes and analyzes some fifty papyri which provide direct, ancient evidence for total and partial stichometry. Modern rediscovery Total Stichometry on a Papyrus Column: A line count in the subscription on the last column of a text by the philosopher Philodemus (1st century BC). The first line says 'ΦΙΛΟΔΗΜ[ΟΥ]' or 'By Philodemus' (brackets around restored characters). The second says '[ΠΕΡΙ ΡΗΤ]ΟΡΙΚΗϹ' or 'On Rhetoric.' The last says 'XXXXHH' or '4200 [lines] (written with attic numerals).' Transcription of papyrus charred by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79 and excavated at Herculaneum (Oxford, 1824). Friedrich Ritschl, a leading German classicist in the mid-19th century, stimulated interest in the mysterious numerals found at the end of medieval manuscripts by discussing them in several of his essays.See, for example, F. Ritschl, '‘Die Stichometrie der Alten,’ in Opuscula Philologica (Leipzig, 1866), vol. I, pp. 74--112. In an 1878 article that Ohly called ‘epoch-making,’ Charles Graux proved that the numerals at the end of the medieval manuscripts were proportional to the length of each work and in fact gave the total number of a fixed unit equal to a Homeric line.The article ‘Nouvelles Recherches sur la Stichométrie’ first appeared in the Revue de Philologie, new series 2, 1878, pp. 97 – 143 and was reprinted in Les Articles Originaux. ‘Epoch-making’: see Ohly, p. 95. This discovery established the concept of the standard line. While studying the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated letters in the margins of two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He was able to show that other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.Martin Schanz, ‘Zur Stichometrie,’ Hermes, vol. 16, no. 2, 1881, pp. 309 – 315. Theodor Birt's well-known The Nature of the Ancient Book (1882)Das antike Buchwesen in seinem Verhältnis zur Literatur, 1882. substantially widened research on stichometry. Birt saw that Graux's breakthrough led to a cascade of insights about scribal practices and publishing, citations and intertextuality, and the kinds of formats and editions used in antiquity. Stichometry thus led to a broader study of the spatial organization of ancient books and their social, economic, and intellectual roles. As Hermann Diels said, > The investigations of the recently deceased Charles Graux, taken all too > prematurely from the world of scholarship, have made it henceforth > inalterably certain that the standard line (the stichos) of the ancients was > a unit of spatial length equal to the hexameter. Theodor Birt has rightly > erected his shrewd and persuasive The Nature of the Ancient Book upon this > foundation.H. Diels, 'Stichometrisches,' Hermes, vol. 17, no. 3, 1882, p. > 377. Birt's 550-page work was stimulated by practical questions about the ancient culture of books but grew into a broad reevaluation and reorganization of our knowledge of ancient literature and intellectual life. His introduction argued: > The nature of the literature of antiquity and the form of the ancient book > reciprocally conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped > and modified literary creativity. The dividends of these investigations will > thereby far exceed the satisfaction of merely antiquarian pleasures.Das > antike Buchwesen, p. 502. Many of Birt's theories and interpretations are dated and have been superseded by later research, but he permanently broadened and deepened the methodologies used in histories of the ancient book and connected stichometry to a broad range of intellectual and literary issues.For a discussion of the development of the field, see In 1893, James Rendel Harris' book Stichometry extended these new developments to an analysis of the stichometric data found in many early manuscripts of the Christian Bible and other Christian texts.James Rendel Harris, Stichometry (London: C.J. Clay & Sons, 1893). In 1909, Domenico Bassi published a survey of the stichometric notations found on the papyri excavated at Herculaneum.Domenico Bassi, ‘La Sticometria Nei Papiri Ercolanesi,’ Revista di Filologia, vol. 37, no. 3, 1909, pp. 321 -- 363 (Internet Archive). At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, archaeologists discovered a large number of fragmentary, Greek scrolls in Egyptian tombs, mummies, and city dumps. Some of these contained stichometric notations, and papyrologists became interested in the question of whether this data provided clues that would aid in reassembling the fragments. Kurt Ohly studied the stichometry found in many of the scrolls excavated at Herculaneum in Italy but his 1929 book Stichometrische UntersuchungenKurt Ohly, Stichometrische Untersuchungen (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928). contained a complete survey of the treasure trove of newly discovered Greco- Egyptian papyri with stichometric notations. It is regarded as the standard work on stichometry. Ohly discusses the length of the standard line, the evidence for syllable counting, the various number systems used in stichometric reports, and the aims and history of stichometry among the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. Ohly's catalog of ancient papyri with stichometry together with Bassi's survey and the line reports in medieval manuscripts collected by Graux provide a wide range of evidence for ancient stichometric practices and their evolution through the centuries. Recent research and applications Partial stichometry in Plato: The lambda in the margin means 'line 1100' since lambda is the eleventh letter in the Greek alphabet. The Greeks used letters of the alphabet for numerals but decorated them to distinguish them from ordinary letters, here with a two bars and two dots. The same stichometric notations appear in another Plato manuscript and they probably derive from an early edition.Martin Schanz, ‘Zur Stichometrie,’ Hermes, vol. 16, no. 2, 1881, p. 313. Schanz argued the Venetus manuscript was not a descendant of the Clarke Codex. Clarke Codex of Plato's Dialogues, copied in AD 895, Bodleian Library, Oxford University, leaf 210v, detail. Rudolf Blum summarized research on stichometry in the catalog of Callimachus at the Library of Alexandria.Rudolf Blum, Kallimachos: The Alexandrian Library and the Origins of Bibliography (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1991), trans. H. H. Wellisch, pp. 157-8. Holger Essler (University of Würzburg) discussed stichometry's role in the ongoing efforts to reconstruct the papyri excavated at Herculaneum.Holger Essler, ‘Rekonstruktion von Papyrus Rollen auf Mathematischer Grundlage,’ Cronache Ercolanesi, vol. 38, 2008, pp. 273 – 308. Dirk Obbink (Oxford University) used stichometry in his restoration of Philodemus' On Piety.See, for example, Dirk Obbink, editor, Philodemus: On Piety, Part 1 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997). Jay Kennedy (Manchester University) claimed in several articlesFor example, J. Kennedy, ‘Plato's Forms, Pythagorean Mathematics, and Stichometry,’ Apeiron, vol. 43, no. 1, Mar. 2010, p. 1 -- 32. and a book, The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues,Jay Kennedy, The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues (Durham: Acumen, 2012). that Plato counted the lines in his dialogues in order to insert symbolic passages at regular intervals and thereby formed various musical and Pythagorean patterns. Rachel Yuen-Collingridge and Malcolm Choat (Macquarie University) used stichometry along with other kinds of evidence to make inferences about scribal practice and copying techniques.Rachel Yuen- Collingridge and Malcolm Choat, ‘The Copyist at Work, Scribal Practice in Duplicate Documents,’ in Paul Schubert, editor, Actes du 26e Congrès international de papyrologie, in the series Recherches et Rencontres published by the Faculté des Lettres de l’Université de Genève, 2012, Volume 30, 827–834. Mirko Canevaro (Durham University) argued that the stichometric totals in the Demosthenes manuscripts descended from the earliest editions. He used these totals to show that the supposed excerpts of documentary evidence inserted in the speeches were not present in those early editions and were thus late forgeries. His book, The Documents in the Attic Orators, includes an introduction to stichometry.Mirko Canevaro, The Documents in the Attic Orators (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).

Biography Charles Allen Pendleton was born in Denver, Colorado, and began working out in his Denver neighbourhood to deal with his tough companions. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army in the Battle of the Bulge where he was taken prisoner of war. He later obtained a degree at the University of Southern California under the G.I. Bill. He became a high school teacher and guidance counselor in Los Angeles, where due to his physique he was given classes containing many delinquent students. Following a return enlistment for the Korean War, he found film extra work in movies such as Prisoner of War, The Man with the Golden Arm and Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments, where he and his friend Joe Gold dragged Charlton Heston's Moses to Pharaoh Yul Brynner. Mae West chose him to appear in her nightclub act as part of her \\"buffed all-male chorus line\\". He was one of the American bodybuilder-actors who migrated to Italy in the wake of Steve Reeves' success in the 1958 film Hercules after he sent a photo to an Italian producer who signed him on a contract. Prior to going to Italy, he saw a clairvoyant who asked him if he had ever been known by the name of Gordon Mitchell. He replied no, but on arrival in Rome, Mitchell was given his new name. He found work first in sword and sandal films such as Sinbad, Seven Slaves Against the World, Treasure of the Petrified Forest (1965), then in Spaghetti Westerns such as Beyond the Law and Savage Guns. Mitchell also appeared in Fellini Satyricon (1969), directed by Federico Fellini. From the early 1970s onwards, he started to diversify into everything from horror (Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks - 1974), Nazi exploitation (Achtung! The Desert Tigers! -1977), sexploitation (Porno-Erotic Western - 1979), French criminal comedy (The Umbrella Coup - 1980), and post-apocalyptic films (Endgame - 1983). He also appeared in the bizarre 1982 Israeli adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's She as \\"Hector.\\" The film was directed by Avi Nesher and co-starred Sandahl Bergman. Mitchell was close friends with fellow American expatriate actors Richard Harrison, Mike Monty (he appeared in a number of films with both and shared an apartment with Monty in Italy during the 1960s), and John P. Dulaney. Like Monty, Harrison and Dulaney, Mitchell acted in low-budget action films in the Philippines during the 1980s, having roles in Commando Invasion and SFX Retaliator for director John Gale. He returned to the United States in the late 1980s and retired from acting, but kept making occasional film appearances until his death from an apparent heart attack in Marina Del Rey, California, aged 80.

Examples of Martin's work are in many important American museums. Biography Martin was born in Albany, New York on October 28, 1836, the fourth and youngest son of Homer Martin and Sarah Dodge. A pupil for a short time of William Hart, his earlier work was closely aligned with the Hudson River School. Other Albany painters of his acquaintance included George Boughton, and Edward Gay. During the 1860s he spent the summers in the Adirondacks, Catskills and White Mountains, and painted landscapes from the sketches he made there at his studio in New York City's Tenth Street Studio Building. On June 25, 1861 he married Elizabeth Gilbert Davis, also of Albany. Martin was elected as associate of the National Academy of Design, New York, in 1868, and a full academician in 1874. During a trip to Europe in 1876, he was captivated by the Barbizon school and the Impressionists, and thereafter his painting style gradually became darker, moodier, and more loosely brushed. From 1882 to 1886, he lived in France, spending much of the time in Normandy, including stays at the Etaples art colony. His work there included a topographical view of the harbor in which a wooden hulled ship is being built in the distance and a steam ship is seen moored on the quays. The rather more atmospheric Cottage in the Forest captures the effect of the parting sun on the dune landscape. At Villerville on the Seine, he painted his celebrated Harp of the Winds, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By 1887 Martin had returned to New York City. In 1893, poverty and poor health induced him to relocate to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he had relatives.Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Feld, S. P., Gardner, A. T. E., Spassky, N., & Luhrs, K. (1965). American Paintings: A Catalogue of the Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volumes 1-2. New York. p. 421. . There, nearly blind, he painted one of his best-known works, Adirondack Scenery (1895) from memory. He died on February 12, 1897, in St. Paul. Although never successful within his lifetime, within two years of his death Adirondack Scenery sold for $5500 and Harp of the Winds (1895) was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Collections As well as being represented in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Martin's paintings can be found in the collections of other important American museums including the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Albany Institute of History and Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Portland Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

They are long- lived, often form nocturnally, and commonly contain heavy rainfall, wind, hail, lightning, and possibly tornadoes.Maddox, R.A., 1980: Mesoscale convective complexes. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Vol.61, 1374-1387. Size A mesoscale convective complex has either an area of cloud top of 100,000 km2 or greater with temperature less than or equal to -32 °C, or an area of cloud top of 50,000 km2 with temperature less than or equal to -52 °C. Size definitions must be met for 6 hours or greater. Its maximum extent is defined as when cloud shield reaches maximum area. Its eccentricity (minor axis/major axis) is greater than or equal to 0.7 at maximum extent. Development MCCs commonly develop from the merging of thunderstorms into a squall line which eventually meet the MCC criteria. Furthermore, some MCC formation can be tracked from the plains in Colorado back to the Rocky Mountains. These are called \\"orogenic\\" complexes.Wetzel, P.J., W.R. Cotton, and R.L. McAnelly, 1983: A long-lived mesoscale convective complex, Part II: Evolution and structure of the mature complex. Monthly Weather Review, Vol. 105, 1919-1937. The characteristics of the meteorological environment that MCCs form in are strong warm air advection into the formation environment by a southerly low-level jet stream (wind maximum), strong moisture advection which increases the relative humidity of the formation environment, convergence of air near the surface, and divergence of air aloft. These conditions are most prominent in the region ahead of an upper level trough. The systems begin in the afternoon as scattered thunderstorms which organize overnight in the presence of wind shear (wind speed and direction changes with height). The probability for severe weather is highest in the early stages of formation, during the afternoon. The MCC persists at its mature and strongest stage overnight and into the early morning in which the rainfall is characterized as stratiform rainfall (rather than convective rainfall which occurs with thunderstorms). Dissipation of the MCC commonly occurs during the morning hours. After dissipation, a remnant mid-level circulation known as a mesoscale convective vortex can initiate another round of thunderstorms later in the day. Structure The structure of an MCC can be separated into three layers. The low-levels of the MCC near the surface, the mid-levels in the middle of the troposphere, and the upper-levels in the upper-troposphere. Near the surface, the MCC exhibits high pressure, with an outflow boundary, or mesoscale cold front, at its leading edge. This high pressure is caused by the cooling of the air from the evaporation of rainfall (commonly referred to as a cold pool). In the mid-levels (mid-troposphere), the MCC exhibits a cyclonic (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) rotating low pressure which is warm compared to the surrounding environment (referred to as a warm core). This mid-level circulation is referred to as a Mesoscale Convective Vortex. The upper-levels contain an anti-cyclonic (clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) rotating high pressure which is a sign of divergence of air. This high pressure is colder relative to its surrounding environment. This divergence at upper-levels and convergence of air at the surface along the cool pool's outflow boundary results in rising motion which aids maintenance of the MCC. Effects and climatology MCCs produce heavy rainfall which can lead to flooding and other hydrological impacts. MCCs are found in the United States during the spring and summer months (warm season), the Indian monsoon region, the West Pacific and throughout Africa and South America. In particular, the heavy rainfall from MCCs accounts for a significant portion of the precipitation during the warm season in the United States.Fritsch, J.M., R.A. Maddox, and A.G. Barnston, 1981: The character of mesoscale convective complex precipitation and its contribution to warm season rainfall in the United States. Preprints, 4th Conference on Hydrometeorology, Reno, Nev., American Meteorological Society, Boston, 94-99. As the warm season progresses, the favorable regions for MCC formation shift from the southern plains of the United States northward. By July and August, the north-central states become the most favorable.Maddox, R.A., K.W. Howard, D.L. Bartels, and D.M. Rogers: Chapter 17: Mesoscale Convective Complexes in the Middle Latitudes. Mesoscale Meteorology and Forecasting, American Meteorological Society, 1986. The mid- level low pressure areas of MCCs have also been tracked to the origin of some tropical cyclones, and on rare occasions, tropical cyclones can generate MCCs. Notable MCCs One of the most notable MCCs occurred overnight on 19 July 1977, in western Pennsylvania. The MCC resulted in heavy rainfall which led to the disastrous flooding of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The complex was tracked 96 hours back to South Dakota and produced copious amounts of rain throughout the northern United States before producing up to of rain in Johnstown. A second notable MCC brought destructive straight-line winds to southern Ontario, Upstate New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island on the morning of 15 July 1995. The MCC produced winds in excess of 160 km/h (100 mph) and was responsible for seven deaths, widespread destruction of forests in the Adirondack and Berkshire Mountains, and over $500 million in property damage.Stephen F. Corfidi, Jeffry S. Evans, and Robert H. Johns, 2015: JULY 1995 DERECHO SERIES. Retrieved on 2015-02-18. The formation of large MCCs over the same general area for a large percentage of the nights in April to July 1993 and their tendency to persist well into the next day was a large part of the cause for the flooding in much of the central United States that year.

Synopsis A murder in 17th-century Oxford is related from the contradictory points of view of four of the characters, all of them unreliable narrators. The setting of the novel is 1663, just after the restoration of the monarchy following the English Civil War, when the authority of King Charles II is not yet settled, and conspiracies abound. Most of the characters are historical figures. Two of the narrators are the mathematician John Wallis and the historian Anthony Wood. Other characters include the philosopher John Locke, the scientists Robert Boyle and Richard Lower, spymaster John Thurloe, inventor Samuel Morland and the Anglican cleric Thomas Ken, who was later Bishop of Bath and Wells. The plot is at first centred on the death of Robert GrovethePeerage.com but later takes in the conspiracies of John Mordaunt and William Compton (of Compton Wynyates), and the politics of Henry Bennet and Lord Clarendon. Furthermore, the characters that are fictional are nonetheless drawn from real events. The story of Sarah Blundy incorporates that of Anne Greene,... Anne Green: an Oxford case ..., British Medical Journal Vol. 285, 18 December 1982 p. 1792 while Jack Prestcott is involved in events based on the life of Richard Willis (of the Sealed Knot). The accounts are written in the form of memoirs by each narrator many years after the events they describe, after Thomas Ken gained his Bishopric but before the death of Henry Bennet. This dates them to 1685, the last year of Charles' reign. A contrast portrayed in the novel is, on one hand, a philosophy based on ancient and medieval learning, and, on the other, the scientific method that was beginning to be applied in physics, chemistry and medicine. The title The four parts of the novel are preceded by Epigraphs taken from Francis Bacon's Novum Organum. The first three quotations describe three of Bacon's four Idols of the mind. The fourth quotation is the source of the title. The quotation is much abbreviated, with no ellipses showing the omissions. The full text (using a slightly different translation to the book) is as follows: :Among Prerogative Instances I will put in the fourteenth place Instances of the Fingerpost, borrowing the term from the fingerposts which are set up where roads part, to indicate the several directions. These I also call Decisive and Judicial, and in some cases, Oracular and Commanding Instances. I explain them thus. When in the investigation of any nature the understanding is so balanced as to be uncertain to which of two or more natures the cause of the nature in question should be assigned on account of the frequent and ordinary concurrence of many natures, instances of the fingerpost show the union of one of the natures with the nature in question to be sure and indissoluble, of the other to be varied and separable; and thus the question is decided, and the former nature is admitted as the cause, while the latter is dismissed and rejected. Such instances afford very great light and are of high authority, the course of interpretation sometimes ending in them and being completed. Sometimes these instances of the fingerpost meet us accidentally among those already noticed, but for the most part they are new, and are expressly and designedly sought for and applied, and discovered only by earnest and active diligence. The term \\"fingerpost\\" is also an obscure synonym for prelate or priest, foreshadowing one of the book's main plot points. In the original Latin, the term \\"fingerpost\\" is simply \\"cross\\" (crucis), echoing the decisive \\"crucifixion\\" revealed in the story: :Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco decimo quarto Instantias Crucis; translato vocabulo a Crucibus, quae erectae in biviis indicant et signant viarum separationes. ...

It is named after William Kerr, who introduced the cultivar 'Pleniflora'. It is the sole species in the genus Kerria; its genus name is also used as a common name (kerria). Description Kerria japonica grows to tall, with weak arching stems often scrambling over other vegetation or rocks. In the wild it grows in thickets on mountain slopes. The leaves are alternate, simple, 3–10 cm long, with a doubly serrated margin. The flowers are golden yellow, with five petals, and evenly- spaced along branches of new green growth. The fruit is a dry single-seeded achene 4–4.5 mm long. Cultivation Kerria is valued in gardens for its golden yellow flowers, which appear in the spring. It is best grown with some shade from full sunlight to avoid blanching the flowers, and needs to be pruned after flowering to maintain health and vigour. Two cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, K. japonica 'Golden guinea' and the double-flowered K. japonica 'Pleniflora', commonly known as bachelor's buttons. Pests and diseases Since 2014 the UK's Royal Horticultural Society has been receiving reports from gardeners and horticulturalists of damage to plants of the shrub Kerria japonica. Symptoms include multiple red spots on leaves, and lesions on the stems, resulting in defoliation and eventual death. It has been determined that this infection is caused by the fungus Blumeriella kerriae, which is specific to the kerria. This highly contagious disease, known in English as kerria twig and leaf blight, was known in the U.S. but has not previously been observed on British plants. It is regarded as a serious threat to the cultivated kerria plants, which are popular garden shrubs.

Christians are not monolithic in their understanding of God's attributes. Classification Many Reformed theologians distinguish between the communicable attributes (those that human beings can also have) and the incommunicable attributes (those that belong to God alone).Herman Bavinck, The Doctrine of God. Edinburgh: The Banner of Truth Trust, 1979. Donald Macleod, however, argues that \\"All the suggested classifications are artificial and misleading, not least that which has been most favoured by Reformed theologians – the division into communicable and incommunicable attributes.\\"Donald Macleod, Behold Your God (Christian Focus Publications, 1995), 20-21. Many of these attributes only say what God is not – for example, saying he is immutable is saying that he does not change. The attributes of God may be classified under two main categories: #His infinite powers. #His personality attributes, like holiness and love. Millard Erickson calls these categories God's greatness and goodness respectively.Millard Erickson, Christian Theology. Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1985. Disputes Various objections have been to certain attributes or combinations of attributes. The omnipotence paradox explores questions like, \\"Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?\\" The problem of evil and the argument from poor design have been proposed to suggest that God cannot be omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient. Nevertheless, these criticisms have been robustly countered from the Scriptures by apologists from beginning from the early Church and throughout Church history. Some Christians overcome these objections by the notion of free will, in which God chooses not to control all that happens despite being able to because He considers freedom more important than an absence of suffering; by the notion that human experience is so limited that we are unable to fully perceive what a loving and fully powerful God \\"should\\" do at any one moment, and by the sheer fact that God, as transcendent creator of all logic and causality, is not bound by these restrictions Himself. Another school of thought is that man is bound by his nature and his nature is always against God. In this understanding the sovereignty of God demands that a sinful humanity cannot do good apart from God, for to be reconciled to God would be an act of goodness outside of mans natural capabilities. In the act of faithfully believing the life, death and resurrection \\"for mans sin\\" by the shed blood of Jesus, the Son of God, till this is done goodness by God's standard is impossible. Generally instead of Free will a holder of this view will take on a more presuppositionalist approach while at the same time apply simple logic is to any attempt at question God's attributes/power/sovereignty. The presuppositionalist will proclaim the Gospel in the hopes God will grant the hearer a saving faith in Jesus despite this information and call to faith going completely against their natural inclinations. \\"Many are called, few are chosen\\" Matt 22:14, \\"all who where appointed to eternal life believed\\" Acts 13:48. The Bible describes that every human inherently knows they need saving from their sin, from God's just judgment against them, but refuse because of their sin committed and sinful nature. God calls all to believe but will only save the elect by conforming their heart to faith in Jesus, though it goes against their anti- God nature. All who deny Jesus are given over to what they want, the elect \\"chosen\\" on the other hand are given a new heart to believe. Enumeration The Westminster Shorter Catechism's definition of God is merely an enumeration of his attributes: \\"God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.\\"Westminster Shorter Catechism, Question and Answer 4. This answer has been criticised, however, as having \\"nothing specifically Christian about it.\\"James B. Jordan, \\"What is God?,\\" Biblical Horizons Newsletter, No. 82. The Westminster Larger Catechism adds certain attributes to this description, such as \\"all- sufficient,\\" \\"incomprehensible,\\" \\"every where present\\" and \\"knowing all things\\".Westminster Larger Catechism, Question and Answer 7. =Aseity= The aseity of God means \\"God is so independent that he does not need us.\\"D. A. Carson, The Gagging of God (Grand Rapids: Zondervan), 1996. It is based on , where it says that God \\"is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything\\" (NIV). This is often related to God's self-existence and his self- sufficiency. =Eternity= The eternity of God concerns his existence beyond time. Drawing on verses such as , Wayne Grudem states that, \\"God has no beginning, end, or succession of moments in his own being, and he sees all time equally vividly, yet God sees events in time and acts in time.\\"Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology, 168. The expression \\"Alpha and Omega\\" also used as title of God in Book of Revelation. God's eternity may be seen as an aspect of his infinity, discussed below. =Goodness= The goodness of God means that \\"God is the final standard of good, and all that God is and does is worthy of approval.\\"Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology, 197. in the King James Version says \\"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God\\". Many theologians consider the goodness of God as an overarching attribute - Louis Berkhof, for example, sees it as including kindness, love, grace, mercy and longsuffering.Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 70-72. The idea that God is \\"all good\\" is called his omnibenevolence. Critics of Christian conceptions of God as all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful cite the presence of evil in the world as evidence that it is impossible for all three attributes to be true; this contradiction is known as the problem of evil. The Evil God Challenge is a thought experiment that explores whether the hypothesis that God might be evil has symmetrical consequences to a good God, and whether it is more likely that God is good, evil, or non-existent. . =Graciousness= The graciousness of God is a key tenet of Christianity. In , it is part of the Name of God, \\"Yahweh, Yahweh, the compassionate and gracious God\\". The descriptive of God in this text is, in Jewish tradition, called the \\"Thirteen Attributes of Mercy\\".Middot, Shelosh-'Esreh\\". Jewish Encyclopedia. The word \\"gracious\\" is not used often in the New Testament to describe God, although the noun \\"grace\\" is used more than 100 times. in the King James Version says \\"the Lord is gracious\\", but the New International Version has \\"the Lord is good\\". =Holiness= The holiness of God is that he is separate from sin and incorruptible. Noting the refrain of \\"Holy, holy, holy\\" in and , R. C. Sproul points out that \\"only once in sacred Scripture is an attribute of God elevated to the third degree... The Bible never says that God is love, love, love.\\"R. C. Sproul, The Holiness of God (Scripture Press Foundation, 1986), 38. =Immanence= The immanence of God refers to him being in the world. It is thus contrasted with his transcendence, but Christian theologians usually emphasise that the two attributes are not contradictory. To hold to transcendence but not immanence is deism, while to hold to immanence but not transcendence is pantheism. According to Wayne Grudem, \\"the God of the Bible is no abstract deity removed from, and uninterested in his creation\\".Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology, 267. Grudem goes on to say that the whole Bible \\"is the story of God's involvement with his creation\\", but highlights verses such as , \\"in him we live and move and have our being\\". =Immutability = Immutability means God cannot change. refers to the \\"Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows\\" (NIV). Herman Bavinck notes that although the Bible talks about God repenting, changing his purpose, and becoming angry, \\"Scripture testifies that in all these various relations and experiences God remains ever the same.\\"Herman Bavinck, The Doctrine of God, 146. Millard Erickson calls this attribute God's constancy, arguing that \\"some interpretations of the doctrine of divine constancy, expressed as immutability, have actually drawn heavily upon the Greek idea of immobility and sterility.\\"Millard Erickson, Christian Theology, 279. The immutability of God is being increasingly criticized by advocates of open theism,D. A. Carson, The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God, 63. which argues that God is open to influence through the prayers, decisions, and actions of people. Prominent adherents of open theism include Clark Pinnock, John E. Sanders and Gregory Boyd. =Impassibility= The doctrine of the impassibility of God is a controversial one.James F. Keating and Thomas Joseph White (eds.), Divine Impassibility and the Mystery of Human Suffering. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009. It is usually defined as the inability of God to suffer, while recognising that Jesus, who is believed to be God, suffered in his human nature. The Westminster Confession of Faith says that God is \\"without body, parts, or passions\\". Although most Christians historically (Athanasius, Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin being examples) take this to mean that God is \\"without emotions whether of sorrow, pain or grief\\", some people interpret this as meaning that God is free from all attitudes \\"which reflect instability or lack of control.\\"Rowland S. Ward, The Westminster Confession for the Church Today, 27. Robert Reymond says that \\"it should be understood to mean that God has no bodily passions such as hunger or the human drive for sexual fulfillment.\\"Robert L. Reymond, A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith (2nd ed., Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1998), 179. D. A. Carson argues that \\"although Aristotle may exercise more than a little scarcely recognized influence upon those who uphold impassibility, at its best impassibility is trying to avoid a picture of God who is changeable, given over to mood swings, dependent on his creatures.\\"D. A. Carson, The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God, 55. In this way, impassibility is connected to the immutability of God, which says that God does not change, and to the aseity of God, which says that God does not need anything. Carson affirms that God is able to suffer, but argues that if he does so \\"it is because he chooses to suffer\\".D. A. Carson, The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God, 68. DA Carson, however, does not represent the historic use of the doctrine which affirms that God does not have emotions given that he is immutable and is incapable of change. =Impeccability= The impeccability of God is closely related to his holiness. It means that God is unable to sin, which is a stronger statement than merely saying that God does not sin.Edward R. Wierenga, The Nature of God: An Inquiry Into Divine Attributes (Cornell University Press, 1989), p. 203. says that \\"it is impossible for God to lie\\". Robert Morey argues that God does not have the \\"absolute freedom\\" found in Greek philosophy. Whereas \\"the Greeks assumed the gods were 'free' to become demons if they so chose,\\" the God of the Bible \\"is 'free' to act only in conformity to His nature.\\"Robert A. Morey, Exploring The Attributes Of God, p. 65. =Incomprehensibility= The incomprehensibility of God means that he is not able to be fully known. says \\"his understanding no one can fathom\\". Louis Berkhof states that \\"the consensus of opinion\\" through most of church history has been that God is the \\"Incomprehensible One\\". Berkhof, however, argues that, \\"in so far as God reveals Himself in His attributes, we also have some knowledge of His Divine Being, though even so our knowledge is subject to human limitations.\\"Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (London: Banner of Truth, 1949), 43. =Incorporeality= The incorporeality or spirituality of God refers to him being a Spirit. This is derived from Jesus' statement in , \\"God is Spirit.\\" Robert Reymond suggests that it is the fact of his spiritual essence that underlies the second commandment, which prohibits every attempt to fashion an image of him.\\"Robert L. Reymond, A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith (2nd ed., Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1998), 167. =Infinity= The infinity of God includes both his eternity and his immensity. says that \\"Yahweh is the everlasting God,\\" while Solomon acknowledges in that \\"the heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you\\". Infinity permeates all other attributes of God: his goodness, love, power, etc. are all considered to be infinite. The relationship between the infinity of God and mathematical infinity has often been discussed.Brendan Kneale, \\"God and Mathematical Infinity\\" Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith 50 (1998). Georg Cantor's work on infinity in mathematics was accused of undermining God's infinity, but Cantor argued that God's infinity is the Absolute Infinite, which transcends other forms of infinity.Yujin Nagasawa, The Existence of God (Taylor & Francis, 2011), p. 111. =Jealousy= , of the Decalogue says, \\"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments\\" (NIV). J. I. Packer sees God's jealousy as \\"zeal to protect a love relationship or to avenge it when broken,\\" thus making it \\"an aspect of his covenant love for his own people.\\"J. I. Packer, Knowing God, p. 154. =Love= 1 John says \\"God is Love.\\" D. A. Carson speaks of the \\"difficult doctrine of the love of God,\\" since \\"when informed Christians talk about the love of God they mean something very different from what is meant in the surrounding culture.\\" Carson distinguishes between the love the Father has for the Son, God's general love for his creation, God's \\"salvific stance towards his fallen world,\\" his \\"particular, effectual, selecting love toward his elect,\\" and love that is conditioned on obedience. The love of God is particularly emphasised by adherents of the social Trinitarian school of theology. Kevin Bidwell argues that this school, which includes Jürgen Moltmann and Miroslav Volf, \\"deliberately advocates self-giving love and freedom at the expense of Lordship and a whole array of other divine attributes.\\"Kevin J. Bidwell, \\"Losing the Dance: is the 'divine dance' a good explanation of the Trinity?\\" in Iain D. Campbell and William M. Schweitzer (eds), Engaging with Keller: Thinking through the theology of an influential evangelical (Evangelical Press, 2013), p. 106. =Mission= While the mission of God is not traditionally included in this list, David Bosch has argued that \\"mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an attribute of God.\\"David J. Bosch, Transforming Mission (Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1991), 390. Christopher J. H. Wright argues for a biblical basis for Mission that goes beyond the Great Commission, and suggests that \\"missionary texts\\" may sparkle like gems, but that \\"simply laying out such gems on a string is not yet what one could call a missiological hermeneutic of the whole Bible itself.\\"Christopher J. H. Wright, The Mission of God: Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative, p. 36. =Mystery= Many theologians see mystery as God’s primary attribute because he only reveals certain knowledge to the human race. Karl Barth said “God is ultimate mystery.”William Stacy Johnson, The Mystery of God: Karl Barth and the Postmodern Foundations of Theology (Westminster John Knox, 1997), 5. Karl Rahner views “God” as “mystery” and theology as “the ‘science’ of mystery.”Karl Rahner, “Reflections on Methodology in Theology” in Theological Investigations, (Darton, Longman & Todd Ltd., 1991), vol. 11, 100,102. Nikolai Berdyaev deems “inexplicable Mystery” as God’s “most profound definition.”N. A. Berdyaev (Berdiaev), “A Consideration Concerning Theodicy” (1927 - #321), translator Fr. S. Janos, Berdyaev.com, accessed November 12, 2009. Ian Ramsey defines God as “permanent mystery,”Ian T. Ramsey, Models and Mystery, 61. =Omnipotence= The omnipotence of God refers to Him being \\"all powerful\\". This is often conveyed with the phrase \\"Almighty\\", as in the Old Testament title \\"God Almighty\\" (the conventional translation of the Hebrew title El Shaddai) and the title \\"God the Father Almighty\\" in the Apostles' Creed. Jesus says in , \\"with God all things are possible\\". C. S. Lewis clarifies this concept: \\"His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power.\\"C. S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain (Fontana, 1966), 16. =Omnipresence= The omnipresence of God refers to him being present everywhere. Berkhof distinguishes between God's immensity and his omnipresence, saying that the former \\"points to the fact that God transcends all space and is not subject to its limitations,\\" emphasising his transcendence, while the latter denotes that God \\"fills every part of space with His entire Being,\\" emphasising his immanence.Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (London: Banner of Truth, 1949), 61. In Psalm 139, David says, \\"If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there\\" (, NIV). =Omniscience= The omniscience of God refers to him being \\"all knowing\\". Berkhof regards the wisdom of God as a \\"particular aspect of his knowledge.\\"Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (London: Banner of Truth, 1949), 68. Romans 16:27 speaks about the \\"only wise God\\". An argument from free will proposes that omniscience and free will are incompatible, and that as a result either God does not exist or any concept of God that contains both of these elements is incorrect. This argument can be applied either to human free will or God's own free will, the latter of which is summarized as follows: An omniscient God has knowledge of the future, and thus what choices He will make. Because God's knowledge of the future is perfect, He cannot make a different choice, and therefore has no free will. Alternatively, a God with free will can make different choices based on knowledge of the future, and therefore God's knowledge of the future is imperfect or limited. =Oneness= The oneness, or unity of God refers to his being one and only. This means that Christianity is monotheistic, although the doctrine of the Trinity says that God is three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Athanasian Creed says \\"we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.\\" The most notable biblical affirmation of the unity of God is found in . The statement, known as the Shema Yisrael, after its first two words in Hebrew, says \\"Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one.\\" In the New Testament, Jesus upholds the oneness of God by quoting these words in . The Apostle Paul also affirms the oneness of God in verses like .The IVP Women's Bible Commentary, p. 96. The oneness of God is also related to his simplicity. =Providence= While the providence of God usually refers to his activity in the world, it also implies his care for the universe, and is thus an attribute. Although the word is not used in the Bible to refer to God, the concept is found in verses such as , which says that God \\"gives all men life and breath and everything else\\" (NIV). A distinction is usually made between \\"general providence,\\" which refers to God's continuous upholding the existence and natural order of the universe, and \\"special providence,\\" which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.Providence in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. =Righteousness= The righteousness of God may refer to his holiness, to his justice, or to his saving activity. A notable occurrence of the word is in - \\"for in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed\\" (NIV). Martin Luther grew up believing that this referred to an attribute of God - namely, his distributive justice. Luther's change of mind and subsequent interpretation of the phrase as referring to the righteousness which God imputes to the believer was a major factor in the Protestant Reformation. More recently, however, scholars such as N. T. Wright have argued that the verse refers to an attribute of God after all - this time, his covenant faithfulness. =Simplicity= The simplicity of God means he is not partly this and partly that, but that whatever he is, he is so entirely. It is thus related to the unity of God. Grudem notes that this is a less common use of the word \\"simple\\" - that is, \\"not composed of parts\\". Grudem distinguishes between God's \\"unity of singularity\\" (in that God is one God) and his \\"unity of simplicity\\".Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology, 177-178. =Sovereignty= The sovereignty of God is related to his omnipotence, providence, and kingship, yet it also encompasses his freedom, and is in keeping with his goodness, righteousness, holiness, and impeccability. It refers to God being in complete control as he directs all things — no person, organization, government or any other force can stop God from executing his purpose. This attribute has been particularly emphasized in Calvinism. The Calvinist writer A. W. Pink appeals to (\\"My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please\\") and argues, \\"Subject to none, influenced by none, absolutely independent; God does as He pleases, only as He pleases always as He pleases.\\"A. W. Pink, The Sovereignty Of God . Other Christian writers contend that the sovereign God desires to be influenced by prayer and that he \\"can and will change His mind when His people pray.\\" =Transcendence= God's transcendence means that he is outside space and time, and therefore eternal and unable to be changed by forces within the universe.J. Gresham Machen, God Transcendent. Banner of Truth publishers, 1998. It is thus closely related to God's immutability, and is contrasted with his immanence. A significant verse which balances God's transcendence and his immanence is : > For this is what the high and exalted One says — he who lives forever, whose > name is holy: \\"I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is > contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to > revive the heart of the contrite.\\" The Shield of the Trinity diagram symbolising aspects of the doctrine of the Trinity. =Trinity= Trinitarian traditions of Christianity propose the Trinity of God - three persons in one: Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.Alister McGrath, Understanding the Trinity, p. 120. Support for the doctrine of the Trinity comes from several verses on the Bible and the New Testament's trinitarian formulae, such as the Great Commission of , \\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\\". Also, 1 John 5:7 (of the KJV) reads \\"...there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one\\", but this Comma Johanneum is almost universally rejected as a Latin corruption.John Painter and Daniel J. Harrington, 1, 2, and 3 John Nontrinitarian Christians do not hold that this is an attribute of God. Some believe that Jesus was only a prophet or perfected human, or that there is only one person of God with three aspects, or that there are two persons, or that they are three separate gods, or in various other doctrines. =Veracity= The veracity of God means his truth- telling. refers to \\"God, who does not lie.\\" Among evangelicals, God's veracity is often regarded as the basis of the doctrine of biblical inerrancy. Greg Bahnsen says, > Only with an inerrant autograph can we avoid attributing error to the God of > truth. An error in the original would be attributable to God Himself, > because He, in the pages of Scripture, takes responsibility for the very > words of the biblical authors. Errors in copies, however, are the sole > responsibility of the scribes involved, in which case God’s veracity is not > impugned.Greg Bahnsen, \\"The Inerrancy of the Autographa\\". =Wrath= Moses praises the wrath of God in Exodus 15:7. Later in Deuteronomy 9, after the incident of The Golden Calf, Moses describes how: \\"I feared the furious anger of the , which turned him against you, would drive him to destroy you.

A contemporary of fellow expatriate painter John Singer Sargent, Stewart was nicknamed \\"the Parisian from Philadelphia\\".D. Dodge Thompson, \\"Julius L. Stewart, a 'Parisian from Philadelphia'\\", The Magazine Antiques (November 1986), pp. 1046-58. His father, the sugar millionaire William Hood Stewart, moved the family from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Paris in 1865, and became a distinguished art collector and an early patron of Marià Fortuny and the Barbizon artists. Julius studied under Eduardo Zamacois as a teenager, under Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts, and later was a pupil of Raymondo de Madrazo. Stewart's family wealth enabled him to live a lush expatriate life and paint what he pleased, often large-scaled group portraits. The first of these, After the Wedding (Drexel University Art Collection, 1880), showed the artist's brother Charles and his bride Mae, daughter of financier Anthony J. Drexel, leaving for their honeymoon. Subsequent group portraits depicted his friends — including actresses, celebrities and aristocrats — often with a self-portrait somewhere in the crowd. He exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon from 1878 into the early 20th century, and helped organize the \\"Americans in Paris\\" section of the 1894 Salon. The Baptism (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1892), which reportedly depicts a gathering of the Vanderbilt family, was shown at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, and received acclaim at the 1895 Berlin International Exposition. He painted a series of sailing pictures aboard James Gordon Bennett, Jr.'s yacht Namouna. The most accomplished of these, On the Yacht \\"Namouna\\", Venice (Wadsworth Atheneum, 1890), showed a sailing party on deck and included a portrait of the actress Lillie Langtry. Another, Yachting on the Mediterranean (1896), set a record price for the artist, selling in 2005 for US$2.3 million. Late in life, he turned to religious subjects, but Stewart is best remembered for his Belle Époque society portraits and sensuous nudes.

He was the son of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford and Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West. Russell graduated from Balliol College, Oxford in 1874 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, as a barrister. On 24 October 1876, he married Lady Adeline Marie Somers, daughter of Charles Somers, 3rd Earl Somers. They had no children, but it is known that he had at least one illegitimate child, an Indian daughter. She lived with the pair until her father died and was then sent to live with her uncle, Herbrand Russell, and his family. She lived on the estate until she was married. Russell was a Liberal member of parliament for Bedfordshire between 1875 and 1885, when the constituency was abolished. He was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1889 and was later a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. In 1891, Russell inherited the title of Duke of Bedford, together with Woburn Abbey and several other estates which went with it, including Chenies, Buckinghamshire, and the Bedford Estate, a sizeable area of central London including Bedford Square, Russell Square, Bloomsbury Square and Covent Garden. In 1893, at the age of forty, he died of diabetes, at number 37, Chesham Place, London, and was buried in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael's Church at Chenies.

It contains a large pyramid and several mudbrick mastabas. The pyramid was Egypt's first straight-sided one, but it partially collapsed in ancient times. The area is located around 62 miles (100 km) south of modern Cairo. Pyramid The structure of the pyramid The pyramid at Meidum is thought to be just the second pyramid built after Djoser'sAtalay, Bulent Math and the Mona Lisa (Smithsonian Books/HarperCollins, 2006), p. 64 and may have been originally built for Huni, the last pharaoh of the Third Dynasty, and continued by Sneferu. Because of its unusual appearance, the pyramid is called el-heram el-kaddaab -- (Pseudo Pyramid) in Egyptian Arabic. The second extension turned the original step pyramid design into a true pyramid by filling in the steps with limestone encasing. While this approach is consistent with the design of the other true pyramids, Meidum was affected by construction errors. Firstly, the outer layer was founded on sand and not on rock, like the inner layers. Secondly, the inner step pyramids had been designed as the final stage. Thus, the outer surface was polished and the platforms of the steps were not horizontal, but fell off to the outside. This severely compromised the stability and is likely to have caused the collapse of the Meidum Pyramid in a downpour while the building was still under construction. Franck Monnier Monnier, Franck L'ère des géants; (Éditions de Boccard, Paris 2017) p.73-4 and others believe the pyramid did not collapse until the New Kingdom, but there are a number of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 12th Dynasty all pyramids had a valley temple, which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple, which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid, apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two stelas inside, usually bearing the names of the pharaoh, are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted, with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally, the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from the outer cover were stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastrophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from 54 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at Dahshur, the Bent Pyramid. By the time it was investigated by Napoleon's Expedition in 1799, the Meidum Pyramid had its present three steps. It is commonly assumed the pyramid still had five steps in the fifteenth century and was gradually falling further into ruin, because al- Maqrizi described it as looking like a five-stepped mountain, but Mendelssohn claimed this might be the result of a loose translation and al-Makrizi's words would more accurately translate into \\"five-storied mountain\\", a description which could even match the present state of the pyramid with four bands of different masonry at the base and a step on top.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Excavations Map of ancient Lower Egypt showing the location of Meidum The Meidum Pyramid was excavated by John Shae Perring in 1837, Lepsius in 1843 and then by Flinders Petrie later in the nineteenth century, who located the mortuary temple, facing to the east. In 1920 Ludwig Borchardt studied the area further, followed by Alan Rowe in 1928 and then Ali el-Kholi in the 1970s. In its ruined state, the structure is high, and its entrance is aligned north-south, with the entrance in the north, above present ground level. The steep descending passage long leads to a horizontal passage, just below the original ground level, that then leads to a vertical shaft high that leads to the corbelled burial chamber itself. The chamber is unlikely to have been used for any burial. Flinders Petrie was the first Egyptologist to establish the facts of its original design dimensions and proportions.Lightbody 2008: 22Edwards 1979: 269 In its final form it was 1100 cubits of 0.523 m around by 175 cubits high, thus showing the same proportions as the Great Pyramid at Giza, and therefore the same circular symbolism. Petrie wrote in the 1892 excavation report Petrie 1892: 6 that \\"We see then that there is an exactly analogous theory for the dimensions of Medum[sic] to that of the Great Pyramid; in each the approximate ratio of 7:44 is adopted, as referred to the radius and circle ...\\" These proportions equated to the four outer faces sloping in by precisely 51.842° or 51°50'35\\", which would have been understood and expressed by the Ancient Egyptians as a seked slope of 5 palms.Verner.

His brief career encompassed works on a variety of subjects common in the art of the period, including the Romantic fascination with Orientalist themes, historicist genre painting, military painting of Spanish colonial expansion, as well as a prescient loosening of brush-stroke and color. Biography He was born in Reus, a city near Tarragona, in Catalonia, Spain. His father died when he was an infant, and his mother by the time he was 12. Thus, Marià was raised by his grandfather, a cabinet-maker who taught him to make wax figurines. At the age of 9, at a public competition in his town, a local painter, teacher and patron, Domènec Soberano, encouraged further study. At the age of 14 he moved to Barcelona with his grandfather. The sculptor Domènec Talarn secured him a pension allowing him to attend the Escola Provincial de Belles Arts (the Escola de la Llotja). There he studied for four years under Claudi Lorenzale and , and in March 1857 he gained a scholarship that entitled him to two years of studies in Rome starting in 1858. There he studied drawing and grand manner styles, together with Josep Armet i Portanell and Ricardo de Madrazo, at the Academia Gigi. Fortuny in 1867, by Federico de Madrazo In 1859, he was called by the Government of the Province of Barcelona (Diputació de Barcelona) to depict the campaigns of the Spanish-Moroccan War. He went to Morocco from February to April of that year, making sketches of landscapes and battles, which he showed in Madrid and Barcelona when he returned. These would later serve him as preliminary sketches for his monumental piece, The Battle of Tetuan (La batalla de Tetuan, 1862–64, Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya). In 1870, the artist and his family moved to Granada. Originally, this was to be a stage in an extended tourist trip that had taken the group to different localities in Andalusia. However, after arriving in Granada, Fortuny felt compelled to settle down there and work. They arrived in the Summer of 1870 and remained until the autumn of 1872 – a stay of some two and half years. According to several of his biographers, Fortuny established an atelier, known as Estudio de los Mártires, in Granada. The exact location of this studio has remained a mystery. However, recent scholarship has revealed that the location was a house known as Casa de Buena Vista, situated in the neighborhood of the Realejo, at the modern entrance of the Matamoros alley, between the current esplanade of the Alhambra Palace hotel and the Cross of the Martyrs. Pérez- Cellin, J.J., \\"El Taller de Mariano Fortuny ,\\" LOCVS AMŒNVS, 13, 2015, pp 127 - 13 (translated from Spanish) Since the days of Velázquez, there had been a tradition in Spain (and throughout Europe) of memorializing battles and victories in paint. On the basis of his experiences, Fortuny was commissioned by the Council of the Province of Barcelona (Diputació de Barcelona) to paint a large canvas diorama of the capture of the camps of Muley-el-Abbas and Muley-el-Hamed by the Spanish army. He began his composition of The battle of Tetuan on a canvas 15 metres long; but, though he worked on it off and on during the next decade, it was never finished. Mario Fortuny's Studio, a painting by his friend and brother-in-law, Ricardo de Madrazo The greater influence of this travel on Fortuny was his subsequent fascination with the exotic themes of the world of Morocco, painting both individuals and imagined court scenes. He visited Paris in 1868 and shortly afterwards married Cecilia de Madrazo, the daughter of Federico de Madrazo, who would become curator of the Prado Museum in Madrid. Cecelia was a sister of Fortuny's friend, the Orientalist artist, Ricardo de Madrazo, who had previously accompanied Fortuny on travels through Europe. Fortuny and Cecelia had a son, Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo, who became a well-known fashion and tapestry designer. Another visit to Paris in 1870 was followed by a two years' stay at Granada, but then he returned to Rome, where he died somewhat suddenly on November 21, 1874, from an attack of tertian ague, or malaria, contracted while painting in the open air at Naples and Portici in the summer of 1874. After Fortuny's death, his brother-in-law, Ricardo de Madrazo, took care of his studio; cataloguing his works and arranging for an auction at the Hôtel Drouot.[https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/madrazo-y- garreta-ricardo-federico-de/05afacb4-2141-449b-bb76-4c5bcc8400a7 \\"Ricardo de Madrazo,\\" (Brief biography), Museo del Prado. One of Fortuny's pupils was Attilio Simonetti. Legacy Fortuny paintings are colorful, with a vivacious iridescent brushstroke that at times recalls the softness of Rococo painting but also anticipates impressionist brushwork. Richard Muther states: > his marvellously sensitive eye … discerned the stalls of Moorish carpet- > sellers, with little figures swarming, and the rich display of woven stuffs > of the East; the weary attitude of old Arabs sitting in the sun; the sombre, > brooding faces of strange snake-charmers and magicians. This is no Parisian > East…every one here speaks Arabic. Fortuny often painted scenes where contemporary life had still not shaken off the epaulets and decorations of ancient traditions such as the ‘’Burial of a matador’’ and couples signing marriage contracts (La Vicaria). Each has the dazzle of bric-a-brac ornament, Huneker, J., Promenades of an Impressionist, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York; p.128 [https://archive.org/details/promenadesanimp00hunegoog/page/n14 but as in his painting of the Judgement of the Model, that painterly decorative air of Rococo and Romanticism was fading into academicism and left to confront the naked reality of the represented object. He inherited Goya's eye for the paradox of ceremony and reality. Gallery =Paintings= File:MARIANO FORTUNY - La Odalisca (Museo Nacional de Arte de Cataluña, 1861.

Other synonyms include batch system, distributed resource management system (DRMS), distributed resource manager (DRM), and, commonly today, workload automation (WLA). The data structure of jobs to run is known as the job queue. Modern job schedulers typically provide a graphical user interface and a single point of control for definition and monitoring of background executions in a distributed network of computers. Increasingly, job schedulers are required to orchestrate the integration of real-time business activities with traditional background IT processing across different operating system platforms and business application environments. Job scheduling should not be confused with process scheduling, which is the assignment of currently running processes to CPUs by the operating system.  Overview  Basic features expected of job scheduler software include: * interfaces which help to define workflows and/or job dependencies * automatic submission of executions * interfaces to monitor the executions * priorities and/or queues to control the execution order of unrelated jobs If software from a completely different area includes all or some of those features, this software can be considered to have job scheduling capabilities. Most operating systems, such as Unix and Windows, provide basic job scheduling capabilities, notably by at and batch, cron, and the Windows Task Scheduler. Web hosting services provide job scheduling capabilities through a control panel or a webcron solution. Many programs such as DBMS, backup, ERPs, and BPM also include relevant job- scheduling capabilities. Operating system (\\"OS\\") or point program supplied job-scheduling will not usually provide the ability to schedule beyond a single OS instance or outside the remit of the specific program. Organizations needing to automate unrelated IT workload may also leverage further advanced features from a job scheduler, such as: * real-time scheduling based on external, unpredictable events * automatic restart and recovery in event of failures * alerting and notification to operations personnel * generation of incident reports * audit trails for regulatory compliance purposes These advanced capabilities can be written by in-house developers but are more often provided by suppliers who specialize in systems-management software.  Main concepts  There are many concepts that are central to almost every job scheduler implementation and that are widely recognized with minimal variations: * Jobs * Dependencies * Job Streams * Users Beyond the basic, single OS instance scheduling tools there are two major architectures that exist for Job Scheduling software. * Master/Agent architecture — the historic architecture for Job Scheduling software. The Job Scheduling software is installed on a single machine (Master), while on production machines only a very small component (Agent) is installed that awaits commands from the Master, executes them, then returns the exit code back to the Master. * Cooperative architecture — a decentralized model where each machine is capable of helping with scheduling and can offload locally scheduled jobs to other cooperating machines. This enables dynamic workload balancing to maximize hardware resource utilization and high availability to ensure service delivery.  Batch queuing for HPC clusters  An important niche for job schedulers is managing the job queue for a cluster of computers. Typically, the scheduler will schedule jobs from the queue as sufficient resources (cluster nodes) become idle. Some widely used cluster batch systems are * Portable Batch System (PBS) * Slurm Workload Manager * Platform LSF * Univa Grid Engine * Moab * LoadLeveler * Condor * OpenLava * ProActive Workflows & Scheduling  History  Job Scheduling has a long history. Job Schedulers have been one of the major components of IT infrastructure since the early mainframe systems. At first, stacks of punched cards were processed one after the other, hence the term \\"batch processing\\". From a historical point of view, we can distinguish two main eras about Job Schedulers: # The mainframe era #* Job Control Language (JCL) on IBM mainframes. Initially based on JCL functionality to handle dependencies, this era is typified by the development of sophisticated scheduling solutions (such as Job Entry Subsystem 2/3) forming part of the systems management and automation toolset on the mainframe. # The open systems era #* Modern schedulers on a variety of architectures and operating systems. With standard scheduling tools limited to commands such as at and batch, the need for mainframe standard job schedulers has grown with the increased adoption of distributed computing environments. In terms of the type of scheduling there are also distinct eras: # Batch processing - the traditional date and time based execution of background tasks based on a defined period during which resources were available for batch processing (the batch window). In effect the original mainframe approach transposed onto the open systems environment. # Event-driven process automation - where background processes cannot be simply run at a defined time, either because the nature of the business demands that workload is based on the occurrence of external events (such as the arrival of an order from a customer or a stock update from a store branch), or because there is no / insufficient batch window. # Service Oriented job scheduling - recent developments in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) have seen a move towards deploying job scheduling as a reusable IT infrastructure service that can play a role in the integration of existing business application workload with new Web Services based real-time applications.  Scheduling  Various schemes are used to decide which particular job to run. Parameters that might be considered include: * Job priority * Compute resource availability * License key if job is using licensed software * Execution time allocated to user * Number of simultaneous jobs allowed for a user * Estimated execution time * Elapsed execution time * Availability of peripheral devices * Occurrence of prescribed events * Job dependency * File dependency * Operator prompt dependency See also  References ","title":"Job scheduler"},{"id":"2348166","text":"Gruffydd falling from the Tower of London Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (c. 1196 - 1 March 1244) was the Welsh first-born son of Llywelyn the Great (\\"Llywelyn Fawr\\"). His mother Tangwystl probably died in childbirth. Hostage As a boy, Gruffudd was one of the hostages taken by King John of England as a pledge for his father's continued good faith. A clause in Magna Carta (1215) compelled his release. On his father's death in 1240, under Welsh law, he would have been entitled to consideration as his father's successor. Llywelyn however had excluded him from the succession and had declared Dafydd, his son by his wife Joan, to be heir to the kingdom. Llywelyn went to great lengths to strengthen Dafydd's position, probably aware that there would be considerable Welsh support for Gruffudd against the half-English Dafydd.  Power  Gruffudd was given lands in Ardudwy and Merioneth by his father, though in 1221 he was removed for maladministration of those lands. In 1223 he commanded a force of his father's army, against William Marshal. His father then imprisoned him between 1228 and 1234. On his release he was again given lands, this time controlling much of the commotes of Llŷn, Ceri, Cyfeiliog, Mawddwy, Mochnant and Caereinion. Imprisonment Coat of arms attributed to Gruffudd as it appears in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Parker Library MS 16 II (Chronica Majora). Gruffudd was held a prisoner by his brother Dafydd when the latter took over Gwynedd. Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by King Henry III of England in 1241, Dafydd was obliged to hand over Gruffydd into the king's custody, he was then taken to London and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Gruffudd's wife, Senana (possibly a daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey), agreed to pay Henry 600 marks for the release of her husband and their eldest son, Owain, and to hand over her two youngest sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, to the king as hostages to ensure that she kept her part of the bargain. Henry did not keep his part however, and kept Gruffudd and his son imprisoned as \\"guests\\" because this continued to give him the possibility of using Gruffudd as a weapon against his brother. Death However, Gruffudd died while attempting to escape from the Tower in 1244. He is said to have used an improvised rope made from sheets and cloths to lower himself from his window, but as he was a heavy man, the rope broke and he fell to his death. In 1248, the abbots of Strata Florida and Aberconwy arranged for the return of his body to Wales, where he was buried at Aberconwy with his father. Succession After his death Gruffudd's four sons--Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri--would come into their own, and after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales. He also had three daughters, Gwladus, Catherine and Margred. According to several non- contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn was Rhanullt, an otherwise unknown daughter of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. If correct, these sources could indicate that Gruffudd married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senana, an undoubted wife of Gruffudd.

Journalist Sir Max Hastings called it 'among the best' studies of Hitler; Max Hastings, 'The man who saw the future', Daily Telegraph, 19/5/2002 Edward Crankshaw called it a 'quite dazzlingly brilliant analysis'. Edward Crankshaw, book review, The Observer, as quoted in cover blurb, Phoenix edition, 2003 The book analyzes the life and work of Adolf Hitler and is divided into seven chapters, each treating a different aspect of the man. Critical reception The book was a best-seller in Germany and was awarded the Heinrich Heine Prize of the city of Dusseldorf, the Johann Heinrich Merck Prize, the Friedrich Schiedel Literature Prize and, posthumously in 2003, the Wingate Literary Prize. German-language Wikipedia article on Haffner Golo Mann called it a 'witty, original and clarifying book... excellently suited for discussion in the upper classes of schools' book review, Der Spiegel, 24/7/78 For Dieter Wunderlich the book is a 'linguistic masterpiece... not a biography but a concentrated reflection' by a 'wise and original' author. Dieter Wunderlich, Online Review, 2002 Synopsis What follows are Haffner's views on different aspects of Hitler. = Life = According to Sebastian Haffner, whereas Hitler's father made a modest success of life, Hitler, uniquely, failed drastically, then succeeded, then failed again. Haffner, The meaning of Hitler, Phoenix, 2000, p 3. His life lacked education, occupation, love, friendship, marriage, parenthood. A readiness for suicide, of Geli Raubal, Eva Braun and himself, accompanied his career. All soft, lovable traits were missing from his character. He was also full of himself and unselfcritical. Hitler was an 'empty man' who filled himself with pride and hatred.Ibid, pp. 29, 21. =Achievements= Haffner argues that on gaining office in 1933, Hitler achieved many 'miracles' in economic and military policy. ibid, pp. 27-30. . 90% of Germans approved. Had he died in 1938, he would have been remembered as 'one of the greatest Germans ever'.Ibid, p. 40. Few people noticed that he had dismantled the state and concealed the resultant chaos. In the long run, his achievement came to nothing. =Successes= Haffner states that all Hitler's foreign policy successes up to 1939 were gained without bloodshed. From then until 1941, he was also a successful war leader. His attack on Russia began his decline, and the pattern of failure, success, then failure again, is unique in history. Ibid, pp. 50-1. =Misconceptions= Hitler, who believed in the constant Darwinian struggle for power between nations, turned the German state into a war machine, according to Haffner.Ibid, p. 86. For Hitler, the emergency was the norm. The Jews, being internationalists, took no part in this struggle between nations and had to be eliminated in a 'murder of the helpless'. =Mistakes= Hitler achieved the exact opposite of his stated goals, according to Sebastian Haffner. Germany did not become great, but was occupied and divided. The Jews were not eliminated, but created their own state. Communism was not defeated; instead, hegemony passed from Europe to the US and the USSR. European colonial empires dissolved: 'Today's world, whether we like it or not, is the work of Hitler.'Ibid, p. 100. When Germany failed to meet his expectations for conquest, Hitler wished it to be annihilated. =Crimes= Haffner asserts that Hitler was a criminal who killed millions for his own gratification. He does not stand with Alexander or Napoleon but with Crippen or Christie. His victims included invalids, Gipsies, Poles, Russians and Jews. In December 1941 he abandoned the goal of world conquest in favour of the Final solution–exterminating the Jews. ibid, p 143 =Betrayal= From October 1944, Hitler deliberately prolonged the war by eliminating moderate opposition within Germany, in Haffner's opinion. In doing so he betrayed the German people and his 'fight to the finish' created a 'stirring legend' but destroyed Germany as a unified nation. Ibid p 150-3 The Ardennes offensive allowed the Russians to take Berlin, allowing Russia the upper hand in postwar Europe. Hitler said, 'the future belongs exclusively to the stronger nation from the east.' One of the effects of this, Haffner claims, is that after Hitler, Germans no longer dare to be patriotsIbid, p. 165., not knowing how much precisely this anti-patriotism is fulfillment of Hitler's last wish.

History The township was incorporated in 2001, through the amalgamation of the former townships of Bicroft, Cardiff, Glamorgan and Monmouth. Communities Cardiff is a former mining community; the mines opened in 1956 and closed several years later. The chief mineral being mined in Cardiff was uranium. Cardiff is located on Highway 118 between the towns of Bancroft and Haliburton. The Cardiff Elementary School is a small school. The community also has a Royal Canadian Legion hall, a Catholic and United Church, as well as an outdoor pool which is popular during the summer, Post Office, Municipal Office, Library, and a Skating Rink that doubles as an outdoor Basketball/Floor hockey court. The entrance to the townsite, off of Highway 118, is marked by a large metal sculpture of a dragonfly. Gooderham is bordered on the south by the Irondale River and Pine Lake to the north. It is located on a now defunct railway line, the IB&O; Railway, part of which has been since converted into a trail network. The village of Gooderham is at the intersection of the Monk Road from the east and the Buckhorn Road from the south. The origin of the name Gooderham is not known for sure although it is likely that it was named after a member of the distillery-owning Gooderham family donated money for a local church. In any case, it was called Gooderham by the time the first post office was established in 1873. The first mills were built by 1875 using the waterfall between Gooderham Lake and the Irondale River. Logging and farming were the original attractions of the Gooderham area and Gooderham still has an active lumber mill. Wilberforce circa 1917 Wilberforce was established as \\"Pusey,\\" a station on the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa (IB&O;) Railway, and named for railway president Charles J. Pusey. This little railway had initially been built to carry iron ore from open pit mines at Irondale. Although the mines had closed, the railway had high hopes of extending to Bancroft and even higher hopes of reaching Ottawa. At Wilberforce where the railway skirted the southern shore of Pusey Lake (now Dark Lake), the Wilberforce Lumber Company put up a sawmill. In 1909 the Wilberforce mill was leased to James Lauder and Joseph Spears, of Toronto. The IB&O; Railway was taken over by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1912. Messrs. Lauder and Spears along with Lucien B. Howland, (the former General Manager of the IB&O;), looking for new business opportunities, acquired a sawmill on the new CNR line north of Parry Sound, Ontario. The three men eventually established the community of Lost Channel in the Parry Sound District, and went bankrupt in the process. Wilberforce is known among geocachers as the \\"Geocaching Capital of Canada.\\" The first cache in the Town was \\"Wilberforce be With You\\" placed by Geofellas. The township also contains the smaller communities of Cheddar (ghost town), Cope Falls, Deer Lake, Dyno Estates, Essonville, Harcourt, Highland Grove, Hotspur, Ironsides, Maxwells, Pusey, South Wilberforce, Tory Hill, Upper Paudash, Ursa and Ward. Highland Grove was home to \\"Camp Diamond\\" the site of a fabled but unfounded diamond mine. The site was used as a hockey camp for a short period of time and later became an all girls summer recreational camp. Highlands East has 5 fire halls located throughout the municipality, with stations located in Cardiff, Highland Grove, Gooderham, Wilberforce and Paudash. The Highlands East Fire Department only has one full-time employee, its Fire Chief, with all of the firefighters being volunteers.

Herbrand Arthur Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford (19 February 1858 – 27 August 1940) was an English politician and peer. He was the son of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford and his wife Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West, daughter of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr. Family He married Mary du Caurroy Tribe, on 31 January 1888 at Barrackpore, India. She was appointed DBE and died in an aviation accident in 1937, three years before her husband. They had one child, Hastings William Sackville Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford (1888–1953). Herbrand Russell took as his ward the illegitimate Anglo-Indian daughter of his older brother, George Russell, 10th Duke of Bedford. The daughter was known to have lived with the family until she was married and frequently visited them afterwards. Military career He was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards and made Colonel of the 3rd Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment between 1897 and 1908. He fought in the Egyptian campaign in 1882 and in the First World War, where he was mentioned in dispatches. Public duty The Himalayan tahr sculpture unveiled in May 2014 at Lake Pukaki by Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford The Bedford Chapel at Golders Green Crematorium, London, where the 11th Duke of Bedford was cremated in 1940 The Duke of Bedford held the office of Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex between 1898 and 1926, Mayor of Holborn in 1900, Aide-de-Camp to the Viceroy of India between 1885 and 1886, Military Aide-de-Camp between 1908 and 1920 to King Edward VII and King George V, and sometime Deputy Lieutenant of Bedfordshire. He was President of the Zoological Society of London from 1899 to 1936, and was concerned with animal preservation throughout his life. According to Jane Goodall in her book Hope for Animals,Goodall, Hope for Animals the Duke was instrumental in saving the milu (or Père David's deer), which was already extinct by 1900 in its native China. He acquired the few remaining deer from European zoos and nurtured a herd of them at Woburn Abbey. He gifted Himalayan tahr to the New Zealand government in 1903; of the three males and three females, five survived the journey and were released near the Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village. He sent a further shipment in 1909 of six males and two females. Himalayan tahr are near-threatened in their native India and Nepal, but are so numerous in New Zealand's Southern Alps that they are hunted recreationally. A statue of a Himalayan tahr was unveiled in May 2014 at Lake Pukaki and dedicated by Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford. Bedford served as president of the Cremation Society of Great Britain from 1921 to his death in 1940. He had the original cremator from Woking Crematorium moved and fitted inside the Bedford Chapel, a new chapel at Golders Green Crematorium, where he was himself cremated. His ashes are buried in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies. Honours The Duke of Bedford was invested as a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John (KGStJ), as a Fellow of the Society of Arts (FSA) on 14 March 1901, as Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) on 30 May 1902, as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1919, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908. He was made an honorary Freeman of Holborn in 1931. He was made an Honorary Doctor of Law (LL.D.) by Edinburgh University in 1906. His grandson John Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford describes him as follows: \\"A selfish, forbidding man, with a highly developed sense of public duty and ducal responsibility, he lived a cold, aloof existence, isolated from the outside world by a mass of servants, sycophants and an eleven-mile wall.\\" In conjunction with his son Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford, he developed plans to protect the Bedford fortune from the British tax regime. However, he died too soon for these to come to fruition and the only result was to involve his grandson in enormous difficulties in obtaining access to the family properties. Herbrand and Hastings Russell feature largely in the 13th Duke's memoir, A Silver-Plated Spoon (World Books, 1959).

He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round of the 2002 NFL Draft. He played college football at LSU and Northwestern State. Nall also played for the Buffalo Bills, Houston Texans, and Florida Tuskers. Early years Nall was born in Alexandria, Louisiana, and attended Alexandria Senior High School, where he was the quarterback for the football team, having thrown for 5,038 yards and 38 touchdowns. College career =LSU= Nall initially played college football at Louisiana State University. He was redshirted in 1997. In 1998, he was the #2 quarterback behind senior Herb Tyler. When Tyler suffered an injury late in the game at Notre Dame, Nall came off of the bench to lead LSU the length of the field in a furious comeback attempt. The comeback came up short as an LSU receiver dropped the potential game winning pass in the end zone on fourth down as time was winding down. Nall then started the next week in the last game of the season at #13 Arkansas. Nall was sacked six times and threw for 147 yards and was intercepted once. In 1999, Nall had to battle Josh Booty and Rohan Davey for the quarterback position. Nall was named the starter for the season opener but was benched at halftime with LSU leading. He was sacked once for 8 yards and he threw two interceptions in 15 attempts (completing 6 of 15 for 79 yards). Nall made only one other brief appearance at quarterback for LSU in 1999 as he got some late mopup duty the next week. Nall did not play quarterback for the rest of the season. Nall only got two passing attempts in the 2000 season opener after a groin injury hampered him at the end of fall camp. =Northwestern State= In 2001, Nall transferred to Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, where he became the first quarterback in school history to surpass two thousand yards passing in a season. Professional career =First stint with Packers= He was drafted out of NSU by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round of the 2002 NFL Draft with the 164th choice overall. Nall also started for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe in 2003 and was the league's leading passer. In 2004 Nall played in 5 games as Brett Favre's backup at Green Bay. He completed 23 of 33 passes for 314 yards and 4 touchdowns, with no interceptions, and a passer rating of 139.4. =Buffalo Bills= In 2006, Craig Nall signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Buffalo Bills, where he competed for the starting quarterback position until a hamstring injury suffered on the second day of practice ended his involvement in the competition. In 2007, he fell on the team's depth chart behind J. P. Losman and Trent Edwards. At the end of pre-season, he was cut from the team's final roster. Early into the regular season he was re-signed by the Bills but was released shortly thereafter. =First stint with Texans= On October 29, 2007, Nall was signed by the Houston Texans as insurance when starter Matt Schaub was hurt against San Diego. He was released by the Texans on November 21, 2007. =Second stint with Packers= He signed a one-year deal with the Packers on December 1, 2007, after they released Marviel Underwood. He became a free agent in the 2008 offseason. =Second stint with Texans= Nall was re-signed by the Houston Texans on November 5, 2008 after an injury to Matt Schaub. He was waived on December 17 when the team signed fellow Northwestern State alumnus cornerback David Pittman. =Florida Tuskers= Nall was signed by the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League on August 25, 2009.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Rhodes, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Location and population Archangelos is located about 30 kilometers south of the town of Rhodes on the island's east coast at an elevation of 160 meters. Its population according to the 2011 census was 5,384 making it the fifth largest town of the island (after the capital Rhodes, and the town of Trianta (Ialysos), Kremasti and Afantou. The town's name derives from Archangel Michael who is also considered its patron. The municipal unit of Archangelos has a land area of 115.375 km², and includes several other towns, the largest of which are Malónas (pop. 982) and Másari (1,004). Its total population was 7,615 at the 2011 census. History Ruins of the castle of St.John The bell tower of Archangel Michael's Orthodox church, the town's patron Numerous small settlements existed in the broader area of Archangelos during the Hellenistic era, others on the coast and others inland. After the 7th century AD the settlements near the coast were abandoned due to the frequent invasions of pirates and their inhabitants settled on existing inland settlements or founded new ones in more secure areas. Over time the various settlements of the area were merged in one forming the town of Archangelos. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Knights Hospitaller who were occupying the island of Rhodes since 1309, built a fortress (some sort of an Acropolis) on top of one of the town's nearby hills to protect from a possible Ottoman invasion on the island. Ruins of this (castle of Saint John) fortress remain today. Economy Major economic resources include tourism, agriculture (main agricultural products are olive oil and citrus fruits), stockbreeding and pottery. Pottery was always one of the major occupations of the people of Archangelos. It is said that the dome of Hagia Sophia was built using light bricks from Archangelos.

Biography Welf was the son of Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan, and Kunigunde of Altdorf. When Welf's maternal uncle, Welf, Duke of Carinthia (also known as Welf III), died childless in 1055, Welf inherited his property. In 1062 Welf married Ethelinde of Northeim, daughter of Otto, Duke of Bavaria. Although Azzo II of Este continued firm in the interests of Pope Gregory VII, Welf's marriage, and his inheritance of property in Germany, meant that he was more concerned with German affairs and he supported Emperor Henry IV. When his father-in-law, Duke Otto, had become an enemy of Emperor Henry IV and forfeited his duchy, Welf remained loyal to Henry IV. In compliance with Henry's commands, he repudiated and divorced his wife, Ethelinde, and soon thereafter (in 1070) he was rewarded for his fidelity by being appointed Duke of Bavaria in Otto's stead.Schneidmüller, Die Welfen, pp. 132f. This event took place at Goslar in 1070, when the Duchy of Bavaria submitted quietly to the newly made duke, who was the representative of one of the most ancient families in the province. His repudiation of Ethelinde, which could have been considered an act of injustice, does not seem to have been held against him. However, during the Investiture Controversy, Welf changed sides turning against the Emperor, supporting Pope Gregory VII as well as lending his support for the election of Rudolf of Rheinfelden in March 1077. Pope and Emperor were superficially reconciled in 1076, but the following year saw them again engaged in active hostilities. Henry, in consequence of these repeated acts of rebellion, declared Welf deposed in his newly acquired duchy. However, supported by his faithful Bavarians and aided by his father in Italy, Welf was able to maintain his place, and openly defy the ban of the Empire in May 1077. Welf joined the discontented princes who supported the standard of Rudolph, at a time when any who refused to follow the pope's direction could expect to be excommunicated by the church--a potent and effective threat in the social and political conditions of the time. However, Gregory died in 1085 and his successors took a less intensive part in the affairs of Germany. Welf, though still adhering to the party of the church, began to relax in his exertions to support Rudolf of Rheinfelden. After his divorce from his first wife in 1070, Welf married Judith of Flanders, daughter of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and widow of Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria. In 1089, Welf's son Welf married Matilda of Tuscany, thus strengthening relationships with the pope. However, after the younger Welf divorced Matilda in 1095, Welf made amends with Henry IV and was reconfirmed in his position as Duke of Bavaria. After the death of his father Azzo in 1097, Welf tried to acquire his father's property south of the Alps, but did not succeed against his younger half- brother Fulco. In 1099, Welf joined what would become known as the Crusade of 1101, along with William IX of Aquitaine, Hugh of Vermandois and Ida of Austria. His main success was to prevent a clash between fellow Crusaders, who had been pillaging Byzantine territory on their way to Constantinople and the Byzantine emperor's Pecheneg mercenaries. The Crusade itself, entering Anatolia, ended disastrously; after passing Heraclea in September, Welf's Bavarians--like other crusader contingents--were ambushed and massacred by the Turkish troops of Kilij Arslan I, the Seljuq Sultan of Rûm. Welf himself escaped the fiasco, but died on his way back in Paphos, Cyprus, in 1101 and was buried in Weingarten Abbey. He was succeeded as Duke of Bavaria by his son Welf II. Children Welf had the following children from his marriage with Judith of Flanders, daughter of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders: * Welf II, Duke of Bavaria, born 1072 * Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria (died 13 December 1126) * Kunizza, died 6 March 1120, married Frederick Rocho, Count of Dießen See also *Great Saxon Revolt References Sources 70 *B.

It was released for DOS in 1996 and for the PlayStation in 1997. It is the second video game title in the Syndicate series, retaining the core gameplay and perspective of the original Syndicate, but with a setting 95 years further into the future. A first-person shooter follow-up game (also entitled Syndicate) was developed by Starbreeze Studios and released in February 2012, as was a spiritual successor (developed by the Syndicate Wars producer and lead programmer Mike Diskett), Satellite Reign, in August 2015.  Plot  Syndicate Wars follows on from to the events in Syndicate, taking place 95 years later (in the year 2191). At the game's opening, the player-controlled syndicate (called EuroCorp) is at the peak of its power (achieved during the previous game), a megacorporation controlling the world through a combination of military and economic power, and technological mind control, using the CHIP implant technology they developed. Corporate decisions are facilitated through a number of AI entities connected through a global communications network. As the game opens, this totalitarian status quo is threatened by the emergence of a virus named \\"Harbinger\\" in the global communications system, damaging mind- control CHIP implants and leaving citizens vulnerable to co-option. Some of the newly liberated persons, dubbed \\"unguided citizens\\", choose to engage in an armed insurrection. The Unguided appear in early missions as random antagonistic elements, but over time form a well-organized militia. Viral damage to the global network causes disruption to Syndicate coordinations, with individual stations isolating themselves to avoid receiving rogue communication. The London station, as the headquarters of the EuroCorp syndicate, attempts to regain authority via direct intervention by the game's signature quartets of heavily armed agents. The virus was released by the Church of the New Epoch, a religious group led by a group called \\"The Nine\\" and following a religious text known as \\"The Book of Cataclysm\\". The Church are seeking to undermine the world rule by corporations in favor of subjecting its parishioners to its own variety of mind control. \\"Harbinger\\" was their first step in demolishing the existing world order. The Nine began as the Otherworld Research Group (ORG), a group of top scientists who were researching alien technology found at an archeological dig site near Reykjavik. The ORG went into hiding to continue their research on \\"The Codex\\", an encrypted set of alien technological information, subsequently forming the Church. The bulk of the game concerns the development of armed conflict between EuroCorp and the Church. As insurrections take hold, the player is also obliged to conduct missions to control rogue elements within the syndicate itself, as various sub-corporations change allegiances or make bids for independence. The game's story culminates in a battle for control of the moon (accessible via a transport system called the \\"orbital elevator\\"), with The Nine intending to convert ionosphere calibration equipment located there into a weapon (known as the \\"ion gate\\") and destroy all life on Earth; however, The Nine are eliminated, and the weapon deployment does not succeed. The ironic parallels between the objectives of Church of the New Epoch and the original EuroCorp syndicate itself are abundantly clear throughout the game, further reinforced by the fact that the game can be played from the point of view of the Church itself to similar ends. It is revealed early in the game, when played on the Church's side, that the \\"disciple\\" in control of Church agents is a former EuroCorp agent who has been converted. Gameplay Screenshot from in-game combat Syndicate Wars' instruction manual specifically addresses the player as a newly hired EuroCorp executive; however, they can choose to control agents from either EuroCorp or the Church of the New Epoch. The game preserves the isometric view of Syndicate, while adding rotation and pitch controls over that view. The player commands four agents (or acolytes, when playing as the Church), either singly or in groups, to complete a series of globally-located missions, the objectives for which include assassinating a specific target, or stealing a specific object. Although the general mission structure remains consistent when playing as either EuroCorp or the Church, they are made distinctive by differences in the pre-mission briefings which are delivered to the player in the form of a fictional email system. During missions, the health, shields and weapon energy (which functions in the place of specific ammunition) of the player's agents will recharge over time. New weapons can be acquired either by picking them up during missions, or by completing research (which is also used to upgrade agents' cybernetic components). Weapons available early in the game include uzis (the default weapon), miniguns, and flamethrowers; however, later stages of the game introduce directed-energy weapons, such as the pulse laser, electron mace, plasma lance, and graviton gun. Other items of equipment available include rocket launchers, gas grenades, explosives, armed drones, and equipment to direct orbital bombardment from satellites. The 'Persuadertron' device, first introduced in the original Syndicate, is also available (though known as the 'Indoctrinator' when playing as the Church of the New Epoch). This device is used to convert NPCs (both civilians and enemy characters) to follow and fight alongside the player's agents. Some of the game's missions also include objectives to persuade specific characters. Almost all in-game structures can be destroyed, and in-game currency, for conducting research and purchasing equipment, is acquired through the robbing/destruction of banks, which are located within specific missions. The game also includes the ability for both player agents and NPCs to use vehicles, some of which include the ability to fly over in-game terrain. = Multiplayer = Syndicate Wars supports competitive multiplayer, known as \\"Multicorp\\", over a local area network connection, with players receiving points for each enemy agent killed. Mike Diskett (the game's producer and lead programmer) described the multiplayer mode as \\"a mixture of Quake and Command & Conquer, because you end up with the Quake aspect of just going out there to kill as many people as possible, but you also build bases up. This isn't something we've designed in; this is just how we ended up playing it.\\" The PlayStation version also allows co-operative play, where up to four players each control an individual agent, using multiple game controllers and a single shared screen. = Differences in PlayStation version = The PlayStation version of the game features a different introduction cutscene and differences in certain levels compared to the PC version. Some aspects of gameplay are also different between the two versions; for example, the ability to research specific items does not exist in the PlayStation version, with new items instead being made available in a fixed order, following mission completions. The PlayStation version also features different graphics, only functioning in the lower-resolution setting from the PC version, but also featuring some graphical improvements, such as transparency. = In-game advertising = Syndicate Wars included in-game advertising, taking the form of video billboards placed within the game's locations. The adverts within the game included Manga Entertainment's Ghost in The Shell, Judge Dredd from 2000 AD, and Bullfrog Productions' own in- development game project, Creation. Development and release Syndicate Wars was developed by Bullfrog Productions using a modified version of the engine used in Magic Carpet. Mike Diskett, recounted that: > ... in the first [Syndicate], one of the biggest complaints was it was an > isometric view and if you walked behind a building, that was it, you > couldn't see yourself. So now you can walk behind buildings and simply > rotate the map so you can always keep yourself in view. We had to wait for a > while for the technology to catch up so we could actually do that. The AI was also enhanced so that enemies would work as a team, whereas in the original Syndicate each one would act as though unaware of the other members of their group. It was originally announced that the game would be released exclusively for the PlayStation in the second quarter of 1996. Instead, in 1996 it was released for DOS, with the delayed PlayStation version arriving in 1997. A Sega Saturn version also began development; however, it was cancelled later in 1997, with Bullfrog's head of conversions, Steve Metcalf, explaining that the Saturn market was not large enough to cover development costs. Bullfrog Productions also released an official guide to the game, which was printed by Prima Publishing in 1996. In 2008, a digital distribution of the PlayStation version of the game was released on the European PlayStation Network. GOG.com released an emulated version of the DOS version for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2013. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation described Syndicate Wars as \\"even more dark and menacing than the original.\\" He said that while the graphics suffer from chunkiness and ragged characters in the standard VGA mode, in SVGA mode they are stunning. While he complained that the control interface is a pain to adjust to, he found the new weapons, completely interactive environments, and numerous missions make it worthwhile to do so. While similarly praising the polygonal graphics, interactive environments, and numerous missions, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot found the characters to be overly small and hard to discern between, even in SVGA, and complained that the rotational graphics engine often results in enemies getting free hits. He nonetheless concluded, \\"Syndicate Wars masterfully recaptures the dark, deadly emotion of the original, adds to it a huge variety of weapons and scenarios, and refurbishes it with a gorgeous new coat of paint.\\" The game won Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 action game of the year award. Critics widely held the PlayStation version to be inferior to the PC original, chiefly because the translation from mouse and keyboard to gamepad and (optional) mouse results in a control scheme which is convoluted and frustrating. Next Generation said the control \\"just never feels right\\" and Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot commented that \\"the game never plays smoothly, not even when you're fully used to the controls.\\" Despite this, both Rubenstein and Next Generation said they more strongly recommended the PlayStation version than the PC version to strategy fans, since there were few strategy games available on the PlayStation to date, whereas the PC original had debuted in competition with several critically acclaimed strategy games. Critics also widely praised the PlayStation version's highly detailed 3D environments, though some commented that the character animations fail to adequately stand out. Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly assessed that \\"I like the futuristic Blade Runner-type setting, but other factors weighed this game down, like the so-so animation, the pain in the butt controls and the boring gameplay (you pretty much do the same thing each stage).\\" GamePro was more optimistic: \\"... a heavy dose of manual reading is required to play the game, which makes Syndicate Wars difficult to get into at first. After a while, though, you'll be rewarded with an addicting, complex game.\\" Sequels and spiritual successors According to a former Bullfrog Productions employee, a follow-up Syndicate title for PC began development shortly after the release of Dungeon Keeper 2 in 1999; however, this development effort was never completed. This was followed by several further development efforts which did not progress. Alt URL The same employee states that a Syndicate title on PlayStation 2 was under development for approximately one year; however, this title was also never released. It was intended to feature featuring a \\"free-roaming multi-tiered city\\" and two new factions, known as the Freemen and the Hybrid. Several pieces of concept art from this project were released by another former Bullfrog employee, Mike Man. In a 2006 interview at the Leipzig Games Convention for GameSpot, Peter Molyneux (co- founder of Bullfrog Productions) said that he would like to revisit some of his old efforts, but adds that it is very unlikely that will happen. But Molyneux makes one possible exception: > \\"Aside from the licensing complications, some sort of next-gen online > version of Syndicate would certainly be popular with gamers.\\" = Creation = Bullfrog originally planned to create another game in the Syndicate universe, named Creation, and included in-game ads for this game within Syndicate Wars; however, Creation was cancelled during development and never released.The lost worlds of Lionhead and Bullfrog - From the archive: these cancelled projects offer insights into the ambitions of two great studios. on eurogamer.net = Syndicate (2012) = Starbreeze Studios developed a new Syndicate game for EA, replacing the real-time tactics format with that of a first-person shooter. It was announced in September 2011 and released on 21 February 2012. = Satellite Reign = On 15 May 2013, Mike Diskett posted a video on YouTube that revealed an imminent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a new spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars, called Satellite Reign, which returned to the series' original real-time tactics format. When it closed on 28 July 2013, the campaign had raised £461,333 ($720,832), compared to its £350,000 ($546,875) goal. Satellite Reign was subsequently released on August 28, 2015.

The strategy consists in disclosing an enabling description and/or drawing of the product, apparatus or method so that it enters the public domain and becomes prior art. Therefore, the defensive publication of perhaps otherwise patentable information may work to defeat the novelty of a subsequent patent application. Unintentional defensive publication by incidental disclosure can render intellectual property as prior art. One reason why companies decide to use defensive publication over patents is cost. In the United States, for example, to obtain a published patent application, one must incur at least filing fee, examination fee, search fees, and early publication fees (currently $530, minimum plus $300 for early publication), and meet the filing requirements for a proper patent application. :\\"The defensive publication route is especially useful for innovations that do not warrant the high costs incurred in patent applications but to which scientists do want to retain access.\\" S.

Large hop trefoil is a small erect herbaceous biennial plant growing to 10–30 cm tall. Like all clovers, it has leaves divided into three sessile leaflets, each leaflet 15–25 mm long and 6–9 mm broad. Its yellow flowers are arranged into small, elongated round inflorescences 12–20 mm diameter, located at the end of the stem. Each individual flower is decumbent. As they age, the flowers become brown and paper-like. The fruit is a pod usually containing two seeds. The closely related Trifolium campestre (hop trefoil) is a similar, but shorter, spreading, species with smaller leaves and flowers. The middle leaflet of its leaves also has a short rachis. Cultivation and uses The plant is very common, and grows well on poor, undisturbed grounds. While it probably has good nutritive values, perennial species are favored as forage. Distribution Trifolium aureum is native throughout Europe (in Russia this includes non-European Ciscaucasia and western Siberia; in Spain only in the north-east; and in the European portion of the Ukraine this includes Crimea); western and northern Asia and the Middle East (in Armenia; Azerbaijan; Georgia; northern Iran; Lebanon; and Turkey); and Africa (limited to the Canary Islands). Trifolium aureum is widely naturalized in North America: it was first introduced to the U.S. (by way of Pennsylvania) in 1800, where it is now found in the western (as far north as Alaska) and eastern regions of the country, but not in the middle, or very much in the southern states. It is also now found in Canada in all of its southerly provinces (with a possible exception being Manitoba). Similar plants Large hop trefoil, Trifolium aureum, may be confused with other plants that have three leaflets and small yellow flowers, such as hop trefoil (T. campestre), lesser hop trefoil (T. dubium), black medick (Medicago lupulina), and yellow woodsorrel (Oxalis stricta).

The ridge incorporates Esk Pike, Bow Fell, Crinkle Crags and Cold Pike before turning sharply north-eastward to Pike of Blisco; it then makes a further abrupt northerly diversion around Blea Tarn to connect to Lingmoor Fell. To the north of Pike of Blisco is the Oxendale branch of Great Langdale, while Little Langdale stands to the south east. The two valleys drain eastward, joining beyond Lingmoor Fell. To the south of Pike of Blisco is the 393 m (1,290 ft) summit of Wrynose Pass, which links Little Langdale with the Duddon Valley, and beyond the pass lies Swirl How and the Coniston Fells. Between Cold Pike and Pike of Blisco is a wide grassy depression at 528 m (1,740 ft). On the southern side is the source of the River Duddon, while to the north is Red Tarn, a feeder of Great Langdale Beck. Red Tarn is an elongated pool whose stony bed can be seen through clear shallow waters, reputed to hold trout. Its name comes from the colour of the surrounding soil rather than the water itself.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): The tarn forms a focal point for walkers, as the wide path from the summit of Wrynose Pass to Great Langdale runs beside it, with a further path branching off across its outflow towards Crinkle Crags. The main path was originally made to serve Red Crag Mine, which now consists of a series of pits and trial borings for iron ore, concentrated about 300 metres north of the tarn. The mine was worked from 1860 to 1875 but never achieved commercial success.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Pike of Blisco itself consists of the steep, conical summit area above Red Tarn along with a swathe of hilly country spreading out to the south and east. The summit is defended by Kettle Crag to the north and Black Wars to the west, with Black Crag abreast the ridge descending southward to Wrynose Pass. The eastern part of the fell is centred upon the subsidiary top of Blake Rigg at around 530 m (1,740 ft) in an area of rocky outcrops and small tarns. From Blake Rigg a ridge runs north east to cross the summit of the Blea Tarn road at 224 m (735 ft). This pass, narrow and steep even by Lakeland standards, links the two Langdales and is named for the large tarn which sits beneath the eastern crags of Blake Rigg. Its waters hold trout, perch and pike, and the easily accessible shoreline features in many a photograph of the Langdale Pikes. The summit cairn in 2005. Geology The interbedded volcaniclastic sandstone, tuff and lapilli-tuff of the Blisco Member predominate, with an intrusion of rhyolite running across the eastern slopes.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit Unusually for Lake District fells, Pike of Blisco's summit is clearly visible from the valley below, in this case Great Langdale. (Consequently, a good view of the valley may be obtained from the summit.) Before 1959 the summit was crowned with a tall, conical cairn which could be seen from the valley, but between 1958 and 1959 it was apparently vandalised. It has subsequently been rebuilt, although it does not appear as tall today as it does in Wainwright's 1958 drawing. * Panorama Ascent routes There are two distinct routes to the summit from the popular walkers' resort of Dungeon Ghyll at the head of Great Langdale. One goes via Stool End farm at the foot of Bowfell; from here it follows the public footpath over the Oxendale Beck and up to Red Tarn, at around 525 m above sea level, before ascending Pike of Blisco's steep west face. The other route, which takes a generally more even gradient, climbs the mountain's east face using a path that starts from the Little Langdale road.Richards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): It is also possible to climb Pike of Blisco from Little Langdale, via a public footpath from Wrynose Bridge on the road to Wrynose Pass, about from the head of the valley. An alternative route from this direction, recommended by Wainwright, involves scrambling up a gully in the crags above the valley head, then walking across pathless terrain to the summit. The easiest route of ascent, however, is from the Three Shire Stone at the head of the Wrynose Pass, where vehicles may be parked at 393 metres. Pike of Blisco is often climbed as a circuit around the head of Great Langdale incorporating Crinkle Crags and Bowfell, sometimes extended to include Rossett Pike and even the Langdale Pikes.

The church is recognised as one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Wales and is a Grade I listed building, described by Sir Simon Jenkins as 'the glory of the Marches'Simon Jenkins: Wales: Churches, Houses, Castles (Penguin 2008) and by W. D. Caröe as a 'glorious masterpiece'. The iconic 16th century tower rises to a height of 136 feet and is a local landmark that can be seen for many miles around. It forms one of the 'Seven Wonders of Wales'. St Giles' occupies a site of continuous Christian worship for at least 800 years. The main body of the current church was built at the end of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th centuries. It is widely held to be among the greatest of the medieval buildings still standing in Wales. The church contains numerous works of note including decorative carvings and statuary dating from the 14th century, monuments by Roubiliac and Woolner, a stained glass window attributed to Burne-Jones and one of the oldest brass eagle lecterns in Britain. The tomb of Elihu Yale, benefactor of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is located in the churchyard. In recognition of this connection, 'Wrexham Tower' of Saybrook College in the university was modelled on the tower of St Giles'. __FORCETOC__  History  A chapel in this area is believed to have been founded by the Celtic saint Silin (also known as 'Silyn'). A reference in 1620 to a piece of land called Erw Saint Silin (‘St Silin’s acre’) in the township of Acton in Wrexham Parish, highlights the saint’s importance in the area. Both 'Silin' and 'Giles' can be translated into Latin as Aegidius and by 1494 the Church was known as 'Saint Giles'. There may have been a church in the town as far back as the 11th century and the present church is likely the third to have been built on the site. The earliest reference to the church was 1220 when the Bishop of St Asaph gave the monks of Valle Crucis in Llangollen 'half of the [income of the] church ' of the town of Wrexham. In 1247, Madoc ap Gruffydd, Prince of Powys, bestowed upon the monks of Valle Crucis the patronage of the church of Wrexham. In 1330, the church tower was blown down by severe gales which resulted in a new church being rebuilt on the site in the decorated style, some features of which form the basis of the outline of the nave and aisles of the current 15th century building. Either in 1457 or 1463, the church was gutted by fire and work on the present building was started on the same site and incorporated some features of the 14th century church, such as the octagonal pillars. The main part of St Giles was built between the end of the 15th and early part of the 16th Century. The magnificent ornamentation is rich in dynastic Tudor symbolism and was likely financed by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII and husband to Thomas Stanley whose family had strong connections with the Wrexham area. In 1643 soldiers of the Parliamentary army destroyed the original organ which was referred to as 'Ye fayrest organes in Europe'. In the 18th century, the church was depicted by JMW Turner and described by Samuel Johnson as a 'very large and magnificent church'. In 2015, a rare first edition King James Bible from 1611 was rediscovered after centuries of storage in the church.  Architecture and artworks  209x209px The richly decorated five-stage tower, 135-feet high, with its four striking hexagonal turrets, was begun in 1506 and is ascribed to William Hart of Bristol. An example of the Somerset type, it contains 30 niches and is graced by many statues and carvings including those of an arrow and a deer, the attributes of Saint Giles. It is thought that the tower may have been an inspiration for Victoria Tower, at the Palace of Westminster. The nave arcade is in the Decorated style, and dates from the 14th century, but the remainder of the church is in the late Perpendicular style, and includes an unusual polygonal chancel, similar to that at Holywell, and an echo of the one in the contemporary Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey. Above the present chancel arch are large parts of an early 16th-century Doom painting, and the arch beneath shows striking evidence of the tracery which one filled it. The interior of the church contains notable carvings and statuary dating from the 14th century and the 16th century camberbeam wooden roof is adorned with wooden polychrome angels playing musical instruments. The church contains numerous monuments, including an elaborate sculptured memorial by Roubiliac. The brass eagle lectern was presented to the church in 1524. 172x172px There are windows by the studio of Burne-Jones in the north aisle and a series of windows by Charles Eamer Kempe and C.E. Kempe and Co in the south aisle.History of St Giles The lyrics of the Evangelical hymn \\"From Greenland's Icy Mountains\\", written by Reginald Heber, are etched on a window. The hymn was both composed and first performed at the Church in 1819. The church contains a medieval effigy which was found buried in the churchyard at the beginning of the 19th century. This depicts a Welsh knight, bare-headed with long hair, who holds a shield emblazoned with a lion rampant and the words 'HIC JACET KENEVERIKE AP HOVEL' ('Here lies Cyneurig ap Hywel'). Just west of the tower is the grave of Elihu Yale, after whom Yale University in the United States is named. The tomb was restored in 1968 by members of Yale University to mark the 250th anniversary of the benefaction. It is inscribed with a self-composed epitaph beginning with the following lines: 193x193px The churchyard is entered through wrought-iron gates, completed in 1720 by the Davies Brothers of nearby Bersham, who had been responsible for the gates of Chirk Castle, perhaps the finest example of wrought-iron work in Britain, and also made gates at Sandringham House, and at Leeswood Hall, near Mold in Flintshire. In 2012, wrexham.com placed a webcam pointed at St Giles giving a live view of the church.Webcam from Wrexham.com, retrieved 3 July 2016 June 2012 saw a beacon being lit on top of St Giles as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Since 2012, its interior has been re-ordered to include a re-modelling of the Chancel as St David's Chapel, and its north aisle is the home of the regimental chapel of the Royal Welch Fusiliers (now part of the Royal Welsh).  Folklore and culture  One of the sixteen tower pinnacles Local legend suggests that work on the church originally commenced at Brynyffynon but that each day's work was destroyed during the night and, as the day's work collapsed, a phantom voice was heard crying \\"Bryn y Grôg\\". This voice was taken to be a divine indicator that the church should instead be built on the nearby hill of that name. The church tower being blown down in 1330 was believed to have been a divine punishment arising from the town's market being held on a Sunday, which resulted in market day being moved to a Thursday. The tower collapsed on St Catherine's day and a statue of St Catherine appears on the east wall of the tower, possible as a form of protection. A corbel believed to depict Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, shows him with the ears of donkey for reasons unknown. In May 1581, the Catholic martyr St Richard Gwyn was taken to St Giles' and carried around the font on the shoulders of six men and laid in heavy shackles in front of the pulpit. However, he 'so stirred his legs that with the noise of his irons the preacher's voice could not be heard'. There was a local myth that Oliver Cromwell fired a cannon ball at the church tower during the English Civil War. The church organ is referenced in the late-Jacobean Beaumont and Fletcher play, ‘The Pilgrim’ (1647), in which the stock Welshman declares that “Pendragon was a shentleman, marg you, Sir, and the organs at Rixum were made by relevations”. left One of the most popular hymns of the 19th century, 'From Greenland's Icy Mountains' was composed by Reginald Heber on a visit to the vicarage and was first sung in public in the church in 1819. Within Acton Park in Wrexham there is a carved sandstone block which was removed from the Parish Church during the restoration programme of the early 20th century and is reputed to have magical powers so that anyone climbing onto it will be unable to get off. An unsubstantiated rumour suggests that the gravestone of Elihu Yale was stolen by the Yale University secret society, Skull and Bones, and displayed in a glass case within the society's hall known as 'The Tomb'. According to legend, Wrexham town centre is traversed by numerous historic underground tunnels that begin somewhere underneath St Giles Church, and generally end in pubs around the area. An example of the ornate exterior carvings The church's tower is traditionally one of the Seven Wonders of Wales, which are commemorated in an anonymously written rhyme: :Pistyll Rhaeadr and Wrexham steeple, :Snowdon's mountain without its people, :Overton yew trees, St Winefride wells, :Llangollen bridge and Gresford bells. The church's tower is mistakenly called a \\"steeple\\" in the rhyme.

It was founded in the 6th century, supposedly by St Tannwg and St Eithrias, and is the only church in Wales with this dedication. It is now part of the benefice of Bro Ystumanner in the diocese of Bangor. It is thought that the church was so named by Glyndŵr in competition with the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, one of the chapels royal of his rival, King Henry IV of England. Pennal was regarded with honour because of its status as one of the 21 llysoedd, the courts of the native Welsh Princes of Gwynedd. A copy of Glyndŵr's \\"Pennal Letter\\" of 1406, a letter to King Charles VI of France, setting out his plans for an independent Wales, originated from Pennal. While the original letter remains in the Archives Nationales in Paris, a copy is displayed at the Parliament House in Machynlleth, and at the National Library of Wales. The letter was briefly returned to Wales from France for an exhibition at the National Library of Wales in 2000, and a campaign has since sprung up for it to be returned permanently to Wales and put on show at the National Assembly building in Cardiff. A memorial garden was created in the churchyard for the native Welsh princes, during the rectorship of Rev Geraint ap Iorwerth, who was responsible for the church from 1989 until 2012. On his departure, he claimed that the church had become \\"cosy club for members who abide by the rules, accepting of their place in the hierarchy\\". He had previously been the centre of controversy when he burned pages from the King James Bible as part of an \\"art experiment\\". The garden contains a bronze statue of Owain Glyndŵr, made by Dave Haynes of Bethesda, which was unveiled in 2004. Local celebrity Robert Plant, who had made a donation towards the cost of the statue, attended the opening ceremony. Other notable donors included Ray Gravell, Aneurin Jones and Julia Ormond. The church is a Grade II listed building, much of which dates from the 18th century, the original medieval church having been rebuilt in 1700. The porch is built of stone from nearby Llugwy Quarry. The interior includes stained glass windows by Holland & Holt (1872) and by Ernest Penwarden (1923).

He has written numerous books about the Mexican Revolution and leading figures in Mexican history, as well as economic analysis of the nation's history. Krauze founded Editorial Clío publishing house in 1992. He also manages and operates the Documentary Production Company Clío TV; the combined company is Editorial Clío Libros y Videos. He has produced two major TV series on Mexican history, which were also shown in the United States. In 1999 he founded what has become a prominent cultural magazine Letras Libres, which is distributed in several Spanish-speaking countries. Mr. Krauze’s various businesses began struggling financially due to the new government of Mexico (4T) rescinding his companies more lucrative contracts. From early in his career, Krauze collaborated with author Octavio Paz, the Nobel Prize winner, in the magazine Vuelta (Return). He served as deputy editor (1977–1981) and deputy director (1981–1986). Early life and education Enrique Krauze Kleinbort was born in 1947 in Mexico City to parents of Polish Jewish descent. He has two siblings, Jaime and Perla Krauze (b. 1953); the latter became an artist. Krauze received a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from the UNAM, where from 1968 to 1970 he participated as a member of the student council. He earned a doctorate in history from El Colegio de México. In 1978 he received a scholarship for studies from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Early career Krauze began writing and published his first article in the Méxican magazine Siempre in 1971, when he was 24 years old. A year later, he was contributing to the magazine Plural. Krauze published his first book, Caudillos culturales en la Revolución Mexicana (1979) (Cultural Leaders in the Mexican Revolution), which was a study of the Generation of 1915. The following year, he began with the editorial staff of Octavio Paz's magazine Vuelta (Return), serving as deputy editor until 1981. From 1981 to 1986 Krauze was deputy director of the magazine. He was deeply influenced by Paz as his mentor, and this work put him in the center of Mexican intellectual and political life. During this period, he also had academic study and teaching periods abroad, for more than a year as a visiting professor at St. Antony's College (University of Oxford) (from December 1981 to 1983), and at The Wilson Center (from October to December 1987) in Washington, DC. Later career Krauze's writing has covered a broad range of cultural and political subjects, in both his books and essays. He has studied and explored Mexico's cultural and political history. In 1988, Krauze published an attack in Vuelta and The New Republic on prominent novelist Carlos Fuentes and his fiction, dubbing him a \\"guerrilla dandy\\" for the perceived gap between his professed Marxist politics and his personal lifestyle. Noting Fuentes had lived most of the time out of the country, Krauze accused the author of selling out to the PRI government and being \\"out of touch with Mexico.\\" Krauze said Fuentes portrayed the culture as violent and corrupt to appeal to foreign audiences: \\"There is the suspicion in Mexico that Fuentes merely uses Mexico as a theme, distorting it for a North American public, claiming credentials that he does not have.\\" The essay was highly controversial; its publication contributed to a permanent rift between Paz and Fuentes, formerly close friends, that lasted until Paz's death. Their estrangement was also based on Fuentes' support for the Sandinistas. Fuentes brushed off the Krauze affair, saying, “I love having critics for breakfast.” Following Fuentes' death nearly a quarter century later in 2012, Krauze praised the author highly, describing him to reporters as \\"one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century\\". In 1992 he created Editorial Clío publishing house, which he directs. Krauze founded an associated production company, Clío TV, to create documentariesClío TV and his company is now called Editorial Clío Libros y Video. In 1999 he founded the cultural magazine Letras Libres, which is distributed in several Spanish-speaking countries. Krauze was Visiting Research Scholar in the Program in Latin American Studies of Princeton University in Fall 2013. Economic and political liberalism In a July 2012 article published in Bloomberg Opinion, Krauze favored the opening of the Mexican petroleum industry to private investment, as it has been nationalized since 1938. Krauze's support for liberal politics was exemplified by his polemic article, \\"Por una democracia sin adjetivos,\\" published in 1984, in which he strongly defended democracy as a means of social co-existence, not as a panacea that would immediately produce prosperity and material wealth for Mexico. Krauze has acknowledged being influenced by his mentors Daniel Cosío Villegas as well as Paz, both prominent Mexican liberals. His ranking of democracy above other political priorities has attracted critics because of many residents in Mexico suffer from deep poverty and social inequality. Krauze has been consistent in valuing democratic process. In the 2006 Mexican federal elections, he criticized the leftist candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador and characterized him as \\"The tropical Messiah\\" in his article by that title, as López Obrador lacked democratic principles in his proposals, policies, and ideas.Enrique Krauze, \\"El mesías tropical\\", Letras Libras, 2006 Krauze has been a severe critic of the late-20th-century Institutional Revolutionary Party, especially because of the antiliberal characteristics of its late governments. He said that they did not guarantee free and impartial elections, lacked a balance of powers, and he summarized their restrictions as \\"The Imperial Presidency.\\" Awards In 1979, Krauze received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In October 1993 he won the Premio Comillas de Biografía, (given annually by Tusquets publishing house for the best international biography) for his book Siglo de caudillos. He has been a member of the Mexican Academy of History since 1990. In May 1992, he was awarded the Medalla al Mérito Histórico \\"Capitán Alonso de León.\\" On December 16, 2003, he was granted the Condecoración de la Gran Cruz de la Orden Civil de Alfonso X El Sabio. He was selected for the Colegio Nacional in México on April 27, 2005. In August 2008, he received the Orden Isabel la Católica given by the Spanish government.

Other work Among the many documentaries of his production company, Krauze produced Mexico Siglo XX and México Nuevo Siglo, two historical TV series about Mexican history, on Televisa in Mexico; these were also shown on PBS in the United States. México Nuevo Siglo was the first documentary to show on public television the events of the 1968 Tlatelolco student massacre. He is a member of Televisa's Board but has criticized its cultural content. Controversy In 2014 the shelter La Gran Familia in Michoacan was raided, and officials revealed the children were kept in inhumane conditions, having to sleep on the floor and beg for alms in the street. The director Rosa Verduzco was arrested in July 2014 on charges of maltreatment and sexual abuse of hundreds of children. Krauze led a defense of her in the media, noting he had written about the shelter's work in 2000, including how many children she had taken in and educated. He did not comment on officials' reports of conditions.

The song was released as a double A-side with \\"Dreams of Children\\", which originally had been intended to be the sole A-side; following a mix-up at the pressing plant, the single became a double A-side, and DJs tended to choose the more melodic \\"Going Underground\\" to play on the radio. The song covered important social issues of the time such as political corruption, voter apathy and Thatcherism. The song was ranked at #2 among the \\"Tracks of the Year\\" for 1980 by NME.In March 2005, Q magazine placed \\"Going Underground\\" at #73 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, and in October 2006, placed it at #98 in its list of the 100 Greatest Songs Ever.

The brainchild of ex- Stoned Soul Party guitarist Phil Campbell, he recruited vocalist Jon Deverill, second guitarist Dave Bell, bass player Nick Hughes, and drummer Razz. The group was active until 1986. In 2012, the band was re-activated by vocalist Carl Sentance albeit without the involvement of any other past members. History In late 1980, Deverill was headhunted by the Tygers of Pan Tang and replaced by Carl Sentance, a former bandmate of Nick Hughes and Razz in Leading Star. New vocalist in place, Persian Risk issued the now highly collectible Calling For You b/w Chase the Dragon 7\\" in 1981 before sacking Dave Bell's replacement, Alex Lohfink, and soldiering on as a four-piece. The band made further headway by contributing the aforementioned Calling For You to the \\"Heavy Metal Heroes Vol.2\\" compilation (Heavy Metal Records, 1982) and a new cut, 50.000 Stallions, to the \\"60 Minutes Plus\\" cassette compilation (Neat Records, 1982), also issued on vinyl as \\"All Hell Let Loose\\" by Neat in conjunction with Italy's Base Records label in 1983. Adding to their tally, the band followed it up with the Ridin' High b/w Hurt You 7\\" single through Neat, which earned Risk their strongest reviews yet. It would turn out to be the final recording with drummer Razz who was sacked in late 1983. He was briefly superseded by Dixie Lee (ex-Lone Star, Wild Horses) before a more permanent replacement was a found in Steve Hopgood (ex-Chinatown, Shy). The band also added a new second guitarist, Graham Bath (ex-Sphinx). Persian Risk were dealt a significant blow when founding member Phil Campbell successfully auditioned for Motörhead, who would tap his old band for the support slot on their 1984 UK tour. Campbell's successor was Phil Vokins (ex-Tyrant, Wrathchild). Risk also signed a new record deal with London-based Zebra Records and issued the Too Different 12\\" EP in 1984 which saw the band temper their raw approach in favor of a somewhat more polished sound. That same year, Persian Risk made their one and only national UK TV appearance when the band performed three songs - Women In Rock, Rise Up, and Too Different - on Channel 4's ECT program. All three songs would later feature on their \\"Rise Up\\" LP which finally saw the light of day in 1986 on Metal Masters. By that time, the band had already disintegrated, the result of mounting frustration after years of hard work and failing to get that elusive big break. Nick Hughes exited to join Idol Rich, drummer Steve Hopgood co-founded Wild! (and later joined Paul Di'Anno's Battlezone and Killers as well as an early version of Jagged Edge), while Carl Sentance stepped in with Tokyo Blade on their 1986 European tour; he was also brought in as a guest vocalist by fellow Welsh act Tredegar for their 1986 debut album. Graham Bath, too, would later serve a stint with the DiAnno fronted Battlezone and Killers. In February 2012, vocalist Carl Sentance announced on his Facebook page that he had recorded seven new songs and re-cut four old Persian Risk tracks for inclusion on a new Persian Risk album, albeit without any of the original members involved. The participation of Deep Purple keyboardist Don Airey and former Thunder bassist Chris Childs was confirmed by Sentance. In a 29 July 2012 posting on the band's Facebook page, an August release was announced for the new album, entitled Once A King. On it, Sentance, Airey and Childs are joined by bassist Alex Meadows, drummer Tim Brown and the guitar duo of Danny Willson and Howie G. The above-mentioned album was released in October 2012; a limited edition vinyl version was issued by German label High Roller Records. The new Persian Risk played the \\"Hard Rock Hell\\" festival in Wales on 29 November 2012, with a line-up consisting of Sentance, Brown, Howie G. and former Blaze bassist Wayne Banks. They are also scheduled to appear at the \\"Keep It True\\" festival in Germany in April 2014. Their third album, named \\"Who Am I?\\", was released on 6 November 2014. Post break-up activities *Carl Sentance was recruited by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to front the Geezer Butler Band in 1986 but the group ultimately failed to score a record deal. In 1990, he was sought out by Welsh guitarist Paul Chapman of Lone Star, UFO, and Waysted fame to front a new band, Ghost, in Orlando, Florida. It too never got off the ground properly and was mostly ignored by the industry (although an archives release was put together posthumously by Chapman). Sentance also assembled an American version of Persian Risk with guitarist Mark Lanoue; the band gigged in the Southern US area until their demise in 1995. Back in the UK, the singer was involved in a project with members of Wraith before being asked to front legendary Swiss hard rockers Krokus in 1998; he appeared on their Round 13 album and stayed on for the next three years. In 2005, Sentance emerged fronting Whole Lotta Metal alongside co-vocalist Tony Martin of Black Sabbath fame and other British metal session musicians, assembled for a touring cast of cover versions. The singer also served as the voice for the Power Project who issued the Dinosaurs album in 2006. It featured Sentance and veteran US musicians Carlos Cavazo (Quiet Riot, Ratt), Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Dio, Foreigner), and Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Dio). On the live front, the singer teamed up with Deep Purple's Don Airey & Friends and can also be heard on Airey's 2008 solo effort, A Light in the Sky. Sentance issued his debut solo album, Mind Doctor, in 2008; musical guests include Airey on keyboards and the Thunder rhythm section of Harry James and Chris Childs. Sentance became the lead vocalist for Nazareth in 2015. *Steve Hopgood was seen in a late 1990s incarnation of Tank who released The Return of the Filth Hounds - Live album in 1998 and toured Japan as part of a 20th Anniversary NWOBHM festival billing, documented on the Metal Crusade '99 split CD, which also features Samson, Trespass, and Praying Mantis. *Phil Vokins returned in 2006 with Psychowrath, a union with fellow ex-Wrathchild members, bassist Marc Angel and drummer Eddie Starr, and Beyond Recognition vocalist Gaz Harris. The band is still active and playing shows. *Nick Hughes has re-emerged in recent years as a DJ and producer in Trance music circles under the pseudonym Toad. He is also involved in the promoting side of things with 'Toadstool', a psytrance party based in Gloucester, UK where he acts as resident DJ. *Jon Deverill left the rock music world behind after a final pair of Tygers of Pan Tang albums, The Wreck-Age and Burning in the Shade, in the late 1980s and now works as a successful stage actor. A graduate of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, Deverill, stage name: Jon de Ville, most recently appeared in a national tour of Blood Brothers in 2007 and The Sound of Music in London in 2008. An album Deverill originally began recording in the mid-80s with fellow former Tyger Fred Purser under the name of Square World remained in the vaults until its December 2018 release on Mighty Music under the name Purser Deverill - Square One. *Phil Campbell would remain a member of Motörhead for 31 years, recording sixteen studio albums with the band. In 2004, Campbell made 'The 100 Welsh Heroes' list as a result of Wales' largest ever online poll, conducted by Culturenet Cymru. Campbell also won a prestigious Grammy Award with Motörhead in the Best Metal Performance category for their cover of Metallica's \\"Whiplash\\" in 2005. He currently tours and records with Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons.

Marie Railroad (\\"Soo Line\\") L-1 class. It is occasionally operated on the major railroads of the American Upper Midwest.  History  The locomotive was built in 1913 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). It was used by the Soo Line until retirement in 1954, when it went into serviceable storage in Gladstone, Michigan as part of the railroad's strategic reserve. In December 1959, the railroad donated the locomotive to the city of Superior, Wisconsin where it was put on public display. In the mid 1970s, Superior Shortline Steam Railroad Ltd. was organized to restore the locomotive to operations. It made a few short runs in 1983 in Superior, WI before going back in for a major overhaul. The work slowed due to a lack of money and some notable errors (including ordering boiler flues that were three quarters of an inch too short). The locomotive was sold partially disassembled in 1994 to Wisconsin Railway Preservation Trust (WRPT), another organization whose goal was to return the locomotive to operations. WRPT raised $250,000 for the locomotive's restoration. It was originally hoped that the locomotive could be used for excursion trips on the weekend of October 5, 1996, but boiler tests showed the engine to not be ready in time. The 1003's first run after restoration under its own power occurred on October 27, 1996, when it steamed up the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway's Proctor Hill. It performed a few more test runs before its first public excursion in 1997. In 1998 it ran the \\"triple-header\\" excursion with Northern Pacific 328 and Soo Line 2719.  Excursion service  The locomotive made its final journey under its FRA-mandated 15-year boiler certificate on November 13, 2010. But shortly afterwards, the operators raised funds to have the engine overhauled and certified for another 15 years of operation. 1003 returned to service in September 2012, but flue problems delayed its first excursion run until November 2014.

Based on the existing 1973-1981 Laverda 3C model that made 85 hp @ 7,250rpm and reaching speeds of more than 130 mph, the new Jota made a big impression in 1976. Producing 90 hp and reaching speeds of 146 mph, thanks to the factory racing parts fitted into the road engine directly at the factory, it was the fastest production motorcycle to date. The Laverda Jota model ran from 1976 through to 1982. Originally fitted with a crankshaft with 180° crankpin phasing and ignition timing on the right hand side of the engine till 1980. Then in 1981 the ignition timing which was by then electronic, was moved to the left side and in 1982 the Jota 120° was released which had the crankpin phasing to 120°. Early Jotas had a 123 then 140 Watt Bosch alternator, which was barely enough to keep pace with discharge with the lights on. The series 2 180° and 120° Jota onwards had 260 watt Nippon Denso alternator. In Australasia, the UK and South Africa the Jota had high lift camshafts, high compression pistons and less restrictive exhausts. In some European countries (France and Switzerland) Jotas had considerably milder tuning (mild cams -called A12-, flat top low compression pistons, smaller valves and strangled exhausts).

Biography =Early life= James Petigru Boyce was born in 1827. He was educated at Brown University under Francis Wayland, whose evangelical sermons contributed to Boyce's conversion, and at Princeton Theological Seminary under Charles Hodge who led Boyce to appreciate Calvinistic theology. =Career= After completing studies at Princeton he served as pastor of the Columbia S.C. Baptist Church and as a faculty member at Furman University. In 1859 he founded the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Greenville, South Carolina. The seminary was forced to close during the Civil War, and during this period Boyce served as a chaplain in the Confederate army and as a representative to the South Carolina legislature.Louisville Courier-Journal, December 27, 1888, p. 6 After the war ended, he restarted the seminary and moved it to Louisville, Kentucky. He taught theology from 1859 until his death in 1888 and served as the President of the institution. Throughout his ministry, Boyce insisted on the importance of theological education for all ministers. In a preface, he described his Abstract of Systematic Theology, published the year before his death, as follows: \\"This volume is published the rather as a practical text book, for the study of the system of doctrine taught in the Word of God, than as a contribution to theological science.\\" =Death= Boyce died in Pau, France on December 28, 1888. He had traveled to Europe with his family in early July 1888 and had been expecting to be traveling abroad for a number of months. News reports at the time indicated that he had been suffering from gout and that while traveling his condition worsened and became fatal.Louisville Courier-Journal, December 29, 1888, pg 6.

While the album was not particularly successful in the UK charts, the song was the UK's first introduction to The Jam, and was characteristic of Paul Weller's youth anthems—mod-influenced celebrations of British youth—that dominated the band's early output.britannica.com Musically, the song is in the vein of the band's first album, a mod/punk number influenced by The Who's early music, but with an energy and attitude updated for the punk era. \\"In the City\\" borrowed its title from an obscure Who song of the same name, which was released in 1966 as the B-side of the \\"I'm a Boy\\" single (and which can now be found as a bonus track on most CD re-issues of their 1966 album A Quick One). The Sex Pistols' single \\"Holidays in the Sun\\", released six months after The Jam's \\"In the City\\", took its descending introductory chord pattern from the latter. Though \\"Holidays\\" intro is C,B,A,G and played with empty chords, the \\"In the City\\" intro is C,G,D,G and played with major chords; the similarity is rhythmic but generally superficial./tabs.ultimate-guitar.com Lyrically, the song is a celebration of youth in the big city, and of what Paul Weller called the \\"young idea\\", reflecting Weller's optimism for the punk movement. There was also a direct reference to police brutality: \\"In the city, there's a thousand men in uniform/And I hear they now have the right to kill a man\\".

They ran a leading factory from between about 1730 and 1770, and were vernisseurs du roi (\\"varnishers to the king\\"). But they did not invent the process, nor were they the only producers, nor does the term cover a single formula or technique.Osborne, 811 It imitated Chinese lacquer and European subjects, and was applied to a wide variety of items, from furniture to coaches. It is said to have been made by heating oil and copal and then adding Venetian turpentine. Oriental lacquer had speedily acquired high favour in France, and many attempts were made to imitate it. Some of these attempts were passably successful, and it is likely that many of the examples in the possession of Louis XIV at his death were of European manufacture. Chinese lacquer was, however, imported in large quantities, and sometimes panels were made in China from designs prepared in Paris. Biographical details of the career of the brothers Martin are scanty, but it is known that Guillaume, the eldest, was already in business in 1724. Their method and work must have come rapidly into vogue, for in 1730 Guillaume and Simon Martin were granted by letters patent a twenty years' monopoly, subsequently renewed, of making \\"toutes sortes d'ouvrages en relief de la Chine et du Japon\\" (\\"all kinds of relief works from China and Japan\\"). At the height of their fame the brothers directed at least three factories in Paris, and in 1748 they were all classed together as a \\"Manufacture nationale.\\" One of them was still in existence in 1785. The literature of their day had much to say of the Martin brothers. In Voltaire's comedy Nadine, produced in 1749, mention is made of a berline (carriage) \\"bonne et brillante, tous les panneaux par Martin sont vernis\\" (\\"good and bright, all the panels varnished by Martin\\"). The marquis de Mirabeau in L'Ami des hommes refers to the enamelled snuff-boxes and varnished carriages which came from the Martins' factory. As with many great artists, their names were attached to many works they never saw, and the Martins suffered considerably in this respect. That the quality of their production varied between very wide limits is established by existing and undoubted examples; but it is extremely improbable that even their three factories could have turned out the quantity of examples that has been attributed to them. Yet their production was large and miscellaneous, for such was the rage for their lacquer that it was applied to every possible object. The fashion was not confined to France. At its best Vernis Martin has a sheen, polish, and translucence which compel admiration. Every variety of Asian lacquer of the Far East was imitated and often improved upon by the Martinsthe black with raised gold ornaments, the red, and finally in the green ground, powdered with gold, they reached the high-water mark of their art. This delicate work, poudré and wavy-lined with gold or semi with flowers overlaid with transparent enamel, is seen at its best on small boxes, fans, needle-cases and such-like. Of the larger specimens from the Martins' factories many have disappeared, or been cut up into decorative panels. It would appear that none of the work they placed in the famous hotels of old Paris is now in situ, and the really fine examples are in museums. Even the decorations of the apartments of the Dauphin at the Palace of Versailles, executed, or at least begun, in 1749, have vanished; so have those at the Château de Bellevue. Critics have accepted that of the four brothers Robert Martin accomplished the most original and the most completely artistic work. He left a son, Jean Alexandre, who described himself in 1767 as Vernisseur du Roi de Prusse (\\"varnisher to the king of Prussia\\"). He was employed at the palace of Sanssouci, but failed to continue the great traditions of his father and his uncles. The French Revolution finally extinguished a taste which had lasted for a large part of the 18th century.

He always insisted the correct date was November 7, 1873... – March 10, 1953) was an American politician who served as Attorney General and the 30th Governor of the State of Michigan. Early life Groesbeck was born in Warren, Michigan, the son of Macomb County Sheriff Louis Groesbeck and his wife Julia (Coquillard) Groesbeck. Groesbeck attended the public schools of Mount Clemens, Michigan, and of Wallaceburg, Ontario, where his parents resided for two years with their family. Groesbeck wanted to become a lawyer from an early age, and undertook the study of law in the office of an attorney at Port Huron, Michigan. He went on to earn a law degree from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1893. He was admitted to the bar that year and set up practice in Detroit where he rapidly gained the \\"respect, goodwill and confidence of his colleagues, because of his close conformity to the highest ethical standards of the profession\\". Politics Groesbeck's entrance into state politics came in 1912, when he led efforts to select a delegation to the Republican National Convention favorable to the renomination of U.S. President William Howard Taft. Groesbeck also actively led the party faction supporting Taft in the general election. In the same year, Groesbeck was elected the state party chairman, serving until 1914. He was a candidate for Governor of Michigan in 1914, but lost in the Republican primary election to Chase S. Osborn. In 1916, Groesbeck was elected Attorney General of Michigan, and was re-elected in 1918. As reported in The New York Times, Attorney General Groesbeck supported a call for Henry Ford to run for the United States Senate as a Republican. This vision was opposed by many other members of the party.Michigan Republicans Split on Henry Ford – Attorney General Groesbeck Supports Him, June 18, 1918. The New York Times In 1920, he won the Republican primary election for Governor and defeated Democrat and former governor Woodbridge N. Ferris in the general election. After being re-elected in 1922 and 1924, Groesbeck lost to Fred W. Green in the 1926 Republican primary election. In 1924, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, which chose U.S. President Calvin Coolidge to be re-elected. In addition to Groesbeck's political work, he was one of the builders of the Flint-Saginaw Interurban Railway. At the Detroit Club, he was instrumental in 1922 in selecting James Couzens to be the successful Republican candidate for the Senate seat left vacant by Truman Newberry.\\"Tradition\\" from The Detroit Club In 1925, Groesbeck vetoed legislation that would have created a state poet laureate. TIME magazine reported: > Forgetful of the state poets of republican Athens, the Governor's historical > knowledge led him to describe the bill as \\"a reversion to monarchical > customs\\" which \\"has no place in a republican form of government.\\" During his six years in office, the state's highway growth continued, prison reform measures were sanctioned, state titles for automobiles began, and state government was restructured and consolidated. He was defeated in the 1930 Republican primary election by Wilber M. Brucker. Groesbeck is recognized as an important \\"road builder\\" in Michigan, being the first governor to champion the use of concrete and 'take Michigan out of the mud.' In 1924, he opposed a ballot initiative (sponsored by the Public School Defense League) to require attendance at public schools and outlaw private ones; this placed him at odds with the position of the then increasingly popular Ku Klux Klan, which supported the opposing candidate, James Hamilton. Retirement, death and legacy Woodlawn Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan. Groesbeck was later appointed chairman of the Michigan Civil Service Commission, and served from 1941 to 1944. Also in 1944, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention which nominated for U.S. President, Thomas Dewey, who would lose to the three- term President Franklin Roosevelt in the general election. He was also a member of the Detroit Bar Association, the Michigan Bar Association and the American Bar Association, and in club circles was well known as a member of the Detroit Club and the Detroit Athletic Club. Groesbeck's gubernatorial papers are kept in the Archives of the State of Michigan. He died in Detroit and is interred there at Woodlawn Cemetery. Groesbeck Highway (M-97) was named for the governor, both because of the local prominence of the Groesbeck family in Macomb county and Oakland County and because of his strong support for building roads and highways in Michigan. He is memorialized by a state historical marker in the City of Warren.City of Warren, Alex Groesbeck historical marker information.

He had been imprisoned many times due to his role in the campaign for Korean democracy and was later mentioned in Korea as one of the front runners for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  Life  Ko Un, born Ko Untae in 1933, was the first child of a peasant family living in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province. During a time when the national culture was being suppressed under the Japanese occupation, his grandfather taught him to read and write in Korean. He had also learned Chinese by the age of 8. When he was 12, he found by chance a book of poems by Han Ha-un, a nomadic Korean poet with leprosy, and was so impressed that he began writing himself.The Guardian, 8 November 2012 Ko was still a teenager studying at Gunsan Middle School when the Korean War broke out in 1950. Many of his relatives and friends died and during it he was forced to work as a grave digger. He became so traumatized that he even poured acid into his ear to shut out the war’s noise, leaving him deaf in one ear. Then in 1952 Ko decided to become a Buddhist monk. After a decade of this life, during which he published his first collection of poems, Otherworld Sensibility (Pian Kamsang, 1960), and his first novel, Cherry Tree in Another World (Pain Aeng, 1961), he chose to return to the lay life. From 1963 to 1966 he lived on the remote island of Jeju-do, where he set up a charity school, and then moved back to Seoul. However, dependent on alcohol and not at peace, he attempted to poison himself in 1970. Another chance discovery changed this negative state. Picking up a newspaper by chance from the floor of a bar, Ko read about Jeon Tae-il, a young textile-worker who set himself alight during a demonstration in support of workers' rights. Inspired by that selfless act, he lost all inclination to kill himself and turned to social activism.Brother Anthony 2010 After the South Korean government attempted to curb democracy by putting forward the Yusin Constitution in late 1972, he became very active in the democracy movement and led efforts to improve the political situation. In 1974 he established the Association of Writers for Practical Freedom and that same year became a representative of the National Association for the Recovery of Democracy. In 1978 he became vice-chairman of the Korean Association of Human Rights, and vice-chairman of the Association of National Unity in 1979. As a result of these activities, Ko was sent to prison three times, during which he was beaten up and tortured. One of those beatings in 1979 impaired his hearing even further. In May 1980, during the coup d'état led by Chun Doo-hwan, Ko was accused of treason and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, although he was released in August 1982 as part of a general pardon. Life now became quieter and in 1983 Ko Un married Sang-Wha Lee, a professor of English Literature, who was eventually to become co-translator of several of his books. Having moved to Anseong, Gyeonggi-do, he now devoted his energies to a prolific writing career but remained as active an organizer as ever. He was elected chairman of the Association of Korean Artists (1989–90) and president of the Association of Writers for National Literature (1992–93). He served as a delegate in the Committee of National Liberation in 1995. In 2000 he visited North Korea as one of the special delegates for the Inter-Korean summit and this resulted in his volume of poems South and North (2000). In the years since then he has made many other visits to North Korea. He is also chairman of a joint North-South project to compose a Pan-Korean Dictionary covering all the different forms of the language spoken today, involving dozens of scholars from both sides of the 38th Parallel.Brother Anthony 2005 In 2014, he was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for Peace by the Korean National Commission for UNESCO. Ko was not issued with a passport until 1990, when he was at last able to take his place abroad as a leading representative of Korean poetry. From 2007, he served as a visiting scholar in Seoul National University, where he gave lectures on poetry and literature. Since 2010, he was associated with the International Center for Creative Writing at Dankook University. Early in 2013, he was invited to stay for one semester and give several special lectures at the Ca’Foscari University of Venice, Italy, where he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship. On his return to Korea, he moved house from Ansong to Suwon, south of Seoul. =Controversy= In February 2018, Ko's legacy has been under fire. In a poem translating as \\"The Beast\\" or \\"Monster\\", published in the Korean literary magazine Hwanghae Literature in December 2017, poet Choi Young-mi accused \\"En\\", a fictional character whose biographical details match those of Ko Un, of gross sexual misconduct. Other women in the South Korean literary community have afterwards accused Ko of decades of such conduct and allegedly using his power to coerce other vulnerable writers into sexual relations. Debate has followed about removing Ko's poems from South Korean textbooks.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/ko-un-korea- sexual-harassment-claims Writing =Poetry= Ko’s poems range from quiet imagistic reflections to the epigrammatic pieces in Flowers of the Moment with their haiku-like juxtapositions: Other works, however, are huge, like the seven-volume epic of the Korean independence movement under Japanese rule, Paektu Mountain (1987–94). There is also the monumental 30-volume Ten Thousand Lives (Maninbo). This was written over the years 1983-2010 to fulfil a vow made by Ko Un during his final imprisonment, when he was expecting to be executed. If he lived, he swore that every person he had ever met would be remembered with a poem. Speaking of his feelings at surviving the Korean War, when so many he knew had not, he has stated that “I'm inhabited by a lament for the dead. I have this calling to bring back to life all those who have died….I bear the dead within me still, and they write through me.”Quoted in The Guardian, 8 November, 2012 Maninbo’s discursive structure engages biographical and social themes using the rhythms of informal speech with a cumulative effect that has been compared to “the political and encyclopedic ambitions of Charles Reznikoff's Testimony.”Robert Hass, quoted in Brother Anthony 2010 The style is documentary but often leads to a thoughtful ending. =Novels= Many of Ko Un’s novels relate to Seon (Korean Zen) Buddhism and the spiritual life generally. They include The Garland Sutra or Little Pilgrim (Hwaomkyung, 1991), based on the Avatamsaka Sutra, which concerns a boy’s training under a succession of Buddhist Masters. Son: Two Volumes (1995) uses saga form to tell the history of the school’s Masters in China and Korean. Mount Sumi (1999) deals with the persecution of Buddhism during the 18th century under the Confucian Joseon Dynasty and has as sub-theme the karmic links created between individuals in their former lives.Heejung Cha  Publications  Ko began publishing in 1958. He has authored some 155 volumes, including many volumes of poetry, several works of fiction, autobiography, drama, essays, travel books, and translations from classical Chinese. As well as many of his works in English translation, he has also been translated into some dozen other languages.

Released as the lead single for their third album, Different Kind of Free, this was their only No. 1 Christian adult contemporary (AC) single. It also peaked at No. 2 on CHR, making it the second-highest ZOEgirl song on that chart. The group's musical change and the growing digital piracy at the time led to slower sales of ZOEgirl's music.

In 2011, the group reunited for a two-hour interview on The Brian Mason Show, suggesting that they may release a lullaby album in the future. On May 24, 2013, Chrissy registered the ZOEgirlMusic.com domain name with Go Daddy. The group confirmed that they have reunited to create the lullaby album, though nothing has materialized. History = 1999: Making the group = Norman Miller, an artist manager for groups such as Avalon, said one day: \\"I see a need for a girls pop group.\\" He knew Alisa Childers since 1977, when she was two years old, and \\"decided to build the [girl] group around her.\\" Together with Lynn Nichols, a writer and executive producer, they approached Kristin (Swinford) Schweain, who was then part of a jazz group. Nichols said: \\"She [Alisa] had a real writing sensitivity. Then we heard Kristin sing and play the piano. She had a pure pop voice, and it was a really interesting mix with Alisa's more gritty style. Then we said, 'Let's just see what unfolds.'\\" Schweain felt that it was a difficult decision for her to choose between her jazz group and this new opportunity in a girl group: \\"I felt like I was betraying them [her previous group], but at the same time I felt a pull to ZOEgirl and felt led to meet Alisa.\\" She ultimately decided to join the group. They wanted a third member, so Kristin remembered that her friend had \\"a friend in Atlanta who was playing in a band and working with some musicians.\\" Nichols recalls: \\"It sounded kind of flaky, but I told Kristin to give her a call.\\" This girl from Atlanta was Chrissy (Conway) Katina, who was recently rejected by LaFace Records. Katina said: \\"My lawyer thought I was crazy for wanting to join a Christian group. He told me I’d never make any money.\\" Regardless, she chose to become the third member of the group, which has yet to be named.ZOEgirl  Three of a Kind CCM Magazine. Written in 2003. Retrieved on October 30, 2011. = 2000–2002: Pop years and \\"With All of My Heart\\" = This graphic, found on early versions of ZOEgirl's website, explains the band name's meaning. The girl group signed to Sparrow Records but needed a name. Their original name was simply \\"ZOE\\", all in capital letters, their favourite from a list of possible names they have made. However, there was already a trademark for this name, so they added the suffix \\"girl\\" in minuscule letters to form the name \\"ZOEgirl.\\" The name ZOEgirl comes from the Greek word zoe, which, in Greek, means life. Through their music, ZOEgirl talks about life in Christ. ZOEgirl's first, self-titled release was released on August 15, 2000. Most of the songs talk about their relationship with God, although two of them are about fleeing a sinful lifestyle and were not released as singles. \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Living For You\\" both obtained the No. 4 position on the Adult Contemporary (AC) chart, while \\"Anything Is Possible\\" obtained the No. 8 position on the contemporary hit radio (CHR) chart. The album itself peaked at position No. 8 on Billboards Top Heatseekers chart and sold over 350 000 copies by the end of 2003. The single \\"With All of My Heart\\" was released on October 8, 2001 to promote the group's album, Life. The song obtained the No. 1 position for 3 weeks on the CHR Charts, and the No. 3 position on the AC radio charts. Life was released on November 20, 2001 with better critical acclaim and sales compared to their debut album. Over 120 000 copies of this album were sold during the first six weeks of its release, and nearly 370 000 copies were sold by the end of 2003. = 2003–2005: Transition to pop rock and \\"You Get Me\\" = After a drastic musical change from bubblegum pop to pop rock, Different Kind of FREE was released. This is the most critically acclaimed album from ZOEgirl, mainly due to its lead single \\"You Get Me\\" and the Radio Disney single \\"Feel Alright\\". Another factor leading to this album's success is the music video filmed for \\"You Get Me\\". The girls then embarked on the FREE Experience Tour to promote the album with artists Superchick and Joy Williams. ZOEgirl released their final album with Sparrow, Room to Breathe, on January 1, 2005. The album peaked at position 108 on the Billboard 200, and at position No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, making this the highest charting ZOEgirl album to date. However, its two singles were not as successful as the group's past hits. \\"About You\\" peaked at position No. 5 on the CHR charts and at No. 4 on the AC chart. \\"Scream\\" peaked at No. 40 on the AC charts and at No. 14 on the CHR charts. The group's first greatest hits album, With All of My Heart – The Greatest Hits, was released on December 26, 2005. Two new songs were added to the album: \\"Unchangeable\\" and \\"One Day\\". \\"Unchangeable\\" was released as the album's lead single, peaking at No. 20 on CHR and No. 27 on AC. \\"One Day\\" was not released as a single. = 2006: Disestablishment = On September 2006, by means of their now-defunct ZOEgirl fan club site, the group announced that they would quit writing and recording music as a group so that members could tend to their personal objectives. * Chrissy Conway-Katina had a baby girl, and was writing and recording for a solo album titled Beautiful Redemption, though this album was never released. She is currently a photographer and has her own company named \\"Magnify U\\". She is married to James Katina (of the band The Katinas) and has two children named Haylee Raine Katina (b. 2006) and Rylie Siai Katina (b. 2009) * Alisa Childers has released her own self-titled album on December 1, 2007.Alisa Childers.Download my music NOW! Official MySpace blog. Retrieved on May 4, 2008 She was in an independent Christian group named Girard with her sisters and nieces. They got together in late 2009 and released their first self-titled album independently under Calvary Chapel Music on April 20, 2011. She is married to Mike Childers and has two children. She is currently an artist in residence at Whitewater Crossing Christian Church in Cleves, Ohio. In 2020, Alisa was featured in the film American Gospel: Christ Crucified and detailed her journey from the Contemporary Christian Music movement to Christian Apologetics and a distinction between progressive Christianity and conservative Christianity. * Kristin Swinford-Schweain is married to Ryan Schweain and has two children named Stella Rose Elizabeth Schweain (b. February 13, 2007) and Callum Ryan Moses Schweain (b. September 22, 2010). She recorded her own album, \\"Days Of Eden\\". = Late 2000s and 2010: COLMANblue = In 2008, Chrissy formed a new group, COLMANblue, with Kelli Trontel. On September 3, 2008, the group announced that a third member would be part of the band, without mentioning her name. Three days later, it was confirmed that Kristin Schweain was the third member. They recorded a song called, \\"Hey (Not Worth The Worry)\\" and released it as a single in 2009, and was available for a free download on Tangle. They participated in a \\"Hope 4 Samoa\\" concert on October 8, 2009 as well as on The Katinas Friends and Family cruise to Mexico in 2010 before disbanding, most likely because Kristin Schweain was suffering from a complicated pregnancy. On September 22, 2010 Kristin gave birth to her first son, Callum Ryan Moses Schweain, after various complications. = 2011: Reunion = After more than four years of inactivity and separation, ZOEgirl reunited on February 27, 2011 for an interview on The Brian Mason Show. The group made no plans to create music together, but says that it is still possible. But , the group hasn't seem to be active and they appeared to have faded into obscurity since nothing has been announced since 2013.

He also played several seasons with the Chicago Cubs and had short stints with the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves. During his time with the Yankees, Pepitone was thrice-named to play in the All-Star Game and also won three Gold Glove awards. Baseball career =Yankees= In 1958, Pepitone was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. After playing four seasons in the minor leagues, he broke in with the Yankees in 1962, playing behind Moose Skowron at first base. A much-discussed legend was that while on his way to 1962 spring training in Florida, Pepitone spent his entire $25,000 ($ today) signing bonus. He won a World Series ring in his rookie year with the Yankees. Yankee management believed he could handle the first base job and traded Skowron to the Dodgers before the 1963 season. Pepitone responded, hitting .271 with 27 HR and 89 RBI. He went on to win three Gold Gloves, but in the 1963 World Series he made an infamous error. With the score tied 1-1 in the seventh inning of Game Four, he lost a routine Clete Boyer throw in the white shirtsleeves of the Los Angeles crowd, and the batter, Jim Gilliam, went all the way to third base and scored the Series- winning run on a sacrifice fly by Willie Davis. He redeemed himself somewhat in the 1964 Series against the Cardinals with a Game 6 grand slam. The ever- popular Pepitone remained a fixture throughout the decade, even playing center field after bad knees reduced Mickey Mantle's mobility. =Astros, Cubs, and Braves= After the 1969 season, despite having won his third Gold Glove Award, Pepitone was traded to the Astros for Curt Blefary. However, he played only about half the 1970 season before being traded to the Cubs. In Chicago, Pepitone replaced Ernie Banks at first base. Peptitone stayed with the Cubs through the 1971 and 1972 seasons, and was traded to the Atlanta Braves in May 1973. In Atlanta, he played only three games, which marked the end of his major-league career in the United States. =Japan= In June 1973, Pepitone accepted an offer of $70,000 ($ today) a year to play for the Yakult Atoms, (now the Tokyo Yakult Swallows) a professional baseball team in Japan's Central League. While in Japan, he hit .163 with one home run and two RBI in 14 games played. Pepitone spent his days in Japan skipping games for claimed injuries only to be out at night in discos, behavior which led the Japanese to adopt his name into their vernacular—as a word meaning \\"goof off.\\"Markusen, Bruce. \\"Card Corner: 1973 Topps: Joe Pepitone,\\" Hardball Times (May 31, 2013). Life after baseball =Memoirs= Jim Bouton talks extensively about Pepitone in his book Ball Four. Pepitone is described as being extremely vain. Bouton said that Pepitone went nowhere without a bag containing hair products for his rapidly balding head. Pepitone even had two toupees, one for general wear and one for under his baseball cap, which he called his \\"game piece.\\" Bouton told a humorous story about how the game piece came loose one day when Pepitone took off his cap for the national anthem. In January 1975, Pepitone published his own tell-all baseball memoir, titled Joe, You Coulda Made Us Proud. The book received substantial attention for its many revelations, particularly about his abusive father and his self-lacerating candor about his self-destructive ways. Later that year, he posed nude for Foxy Lady magazine, featuring full frontal nudity. =Other work= In the late 1970s, Pepitone played for the New Jersey Statesmen in the American Professional Slow Pitch League (APSPL), one of three men's professional softball leagues active during this period. Pepitone would also serve the front office of the North American Softball League (NASL) for their only season in 1980. In June 1982, Pepitone was hired as a batting coach with the Yankees, but was replaced by Lou Piniella later in the season. Pepitone was given a job in the Yankees front office in the late 1990s, and he was given two World Series rings by the Yankees when they won in 1998 and 1999 as part of being in the front office. Personal life He spent four months at Rikers Island jail in 1988 for two misdemeanor drug convictions. He and two other men were arrested in Brooklyn on March 18, 1985, after being stopped by the police for running a red light. The car contained nine ounces of cocaine, 344 quaaludes, a free-basing kit, a pistol and about $6,300 in cash. Coverage of the story by WOR-TV (Channel 9) in the New York area featured clips of an incredulous Pepitone declaring, \\"I didn't know cocaine was illegal\\", and his brother Vinnie, a NYPD detective, staunchly defending his character. He was released from jail on a work-release program when Yankee owner George Steinbrenner offered him a job in minor- league player development for the team. In January 1992, Pepitone was charged with misdemeanor assault in Kiamesha Lake, New York, after a scuffle police said was triggered when Pepitone was called a \\"has-been.\\" He was arraigned in town court and released after he posted $75 bail. In October 1995, the 55-year-old Pepitone was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after losing control of his car in New York City's Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Police found Pepitone bloodied, disoriented and mumbling as he walked through the tunnel. Authorities charged Pepitone with drunken driving after he refused to take a sobriety test. Pepitone pleaded guilty. When asked if he was staying away from alcohol, Pepitone responded: \\"I don't drink that much.\\" Pepitone has been married three times, all ending in divorces. He married his first wife, Barbara Kogerman, in 1959 and had two children, Eileen and Joseph Jr. In February 1966 he married Diana Sandre and had a daughter named Lisa Ann born in October 1966. He later wed Stephanie Deeker and had son named Billy Joe with her. Pepitone was shot by a classmate at the age of 17 while attending Manual Training High School, the same week that his father died at 39 years old due to a stroke. He did not press charges against the shooter. Pop culture references =Larry David productions= Pepitone has been mentioned in at least five episodes of shows written by or produced by Larry David. He was mentioned in the 1993 Seinfeld episode titled \\"The Visa\\". In the episode, Cosmo Kramer reluctantly describes his experience at a recent baseball fantasy camp, wherein Pepitone was crowding home plate while Kramer was pitching, leading to Kramer's beanball that resulted in a subsequent camp-ending brawl, in which Kramer punched Mickey Mantle. Pepitone was mentioned in the 1994 Seinfeld episode titled \\"The Mom and Pop Store\\". In the episode, George Costanza buys John Voight's car, thinking it belonged to Jon Voight the actor. George tells Mr. Morgan, \\"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.\\" In the 1996 Seinfeld episode titled \\"The Rye\\", Kramer (while driving a hansom cab through Central Park) refers to Joe Pepitone as the designer of New York City's Central Park. Pepitone is mentioned in the sixth season of the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm episode titled \\"The Anonymous Donor\\", in which Larry David's Pepitone jersey gets lost at the dry cleaners. Larry and Leon Black then go out trying to find who is wearing it. In the episode, \\"Mister Softee\\" in the eighth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry and Leon attend a baseball autograph signing where Leon says, \\"I'm gonna go check out Joe Pepitone up in here\\", though Pepitone does not actually appear. =Other TV references= Pepitone was first mentioned in the 1987 Golden Girls episode titled Whose Face Is This, Anyway. In this episode, Blanche tells Dorothy that she cannot possibly begin to comprehend the trauma a gorgeous woman goes through when she realizes her beauty is about to fade. Dorothy yells out, \\"And who do you see when you look at me Blanche, Joe Pepitone?!\\" In the 1994 Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode \\"Zombie Nightmare\\", Mike Nelson refers to Joe Pepitone. Pepitone is mentioned in the first season of The Sopranos episode entitled \\"Down Neck\\". Tony is having a flashback to his childhood during a therapy session with Dr. Melfi when he recalls walking out of his house when he was around 8 or 9 years old and his Uncle Junior shouts from his car \\"Anthony, you hear the game last night?\\", Tony replies \\"No, my mom made me go to bed\\", and then Uncle Junior says \\"Joey Pepitone, three RBIs!\\" Pepitone is mentioned in the show Rescue Me in the episode titled \\"Jeter\\". In it, Tommy Gavin is upset at Lou for betraying his trust. He states that Lou is not Derek Jeter, after previously comparing him to the baseball star, and then he goes on to say that he's not even Joe \\"Goddamn\\" Pepitone. Joe Pepitone was mentioned in the special episode of The West Wing made after 9/11, where the character Josh Lyman describes a baseball cap that his dad got Joe Pepitone to sign and he wore it to school every day during the 7th Grade. =Literature= In 2010, the novella Soul of a Yankee: The Iron Horse, The Babe and the Battle for Joe Pepitone, written by Pepitone's nephews William A. and Joseph V. Pepitone, was released. In it, the ghost of Lou Gehrig takes Joe through his life to show him the error of his ways, while the ghost of Babe Ruth tries to tempt Joe back into the wild life. Pepitone features prominently in two Gary D. Schmidt novels set in the late 1960s: both The Wednesday Wars and Okay for Now. Accolades Pepitone was a member of the 1963, 1964 and 1965 American League All Star Team. He won the Gold Glove award for first basemen in 1965, 1966 and 1969. He also won a World Series ring in 1962 as a player. He also received rings in 1998 and 1999 as an executive with the Yankees.

The game was released in 2007. Gameplay The game is an action-adventure title with heavy hack and slash gameplay. The gameplay of the game resembles a martial arts title focused on melee combat while featuring opportunities for ranged attacks. The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \\"Heavenly Sword\\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade. For exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of quick time events (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on-screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene. In addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them. Projectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the Sixaxis controller through a feature known as Aftertouch. Such projectiles include guiding Kai's arrows after she has launched them, and for Nariko, guiding a cannon or rocket launcher, or picking up and throwing objects. Plot =Setting= The game's story and mythos revolves around the titular Heavenly Sword, a blade said to have been wielded by an unnamed Heavenly deity against a demonic warlord called the Raven Lord. After the battle was won and the Raven Lord defeated, the sword was left in the mortal world, becoming the center of wars over its power. The fighting made the sword lust after the life of its users, eventually killing them after a short time. A warrior tribe finally took charge of the sword, ending the wars and pledging to keep it safe and unused for the world's own good. Among the tribe, a legend said that the sword's original wielder would be reborn in the year of the \\"fire-horse\\", and that this figure would unite the world's scattered tribes and lead the world to peace. =Characters= The game's narrator and main protagonist is Nariko (Anna Torv), a headstrong red-headed woman who was born in the year of the prophesied divine warrior: because she was a woman, her clan saw her as a mockery of the prophecy and a portent of doom. The game's main antagonist is King Bohan (Andy Serkis), a tyrannical ruler who is determined to bring the world's tribes to heel and pave the way for a new golden age. Nariko is trained as a warrior by her father, Master Shen (Ewan Stewart), who both cares for her as a child and has difficulty coping with her role in the clan's seeming undoing and the death of his wife. Nariko's only friend is Kai (Lydia Baksh), a wild and erratic young girl who is the last member of a clan destroyed by the armies of Bohan. Among Bohan's servants are his general, Flying Fox (Steven Berkoff): his serpentine mistress Whiptail (Race Davies): and Roach (Richard Ridings), Bohan's son, of whom the king is so ashamed because of Roach's obese appearance that he will not even acknowledge Roach as his own. =Story= The game begins in medias res, with Nariko fighting the forces of Bohan. As she is fighting the sword finishes draining her life and she seemingly dies, waking in a field and speaking to the power within the sword about what has happened. Five days before, Nariko's clan is assaulted by King Bohan's forces. Before she joins the fight, Shen thrusts the sword into the ground next to her demanding that she take care of it. Nariko fights alongside her father and her clansmen as their defenses are weakened and stretched by scores of Bohan's warriors scaling the city walls accompanied by catapults. As the warriors and Shen escape from Bohan's Army, Nariko protects them until spotting a catapult moving toward the fort. As Shen had earlier instructed her, she flees, as the fortress is apparently destroyed behind her. She passes a large black bird with a golden head, the animal form of the Raven Lord. When Bohan's army captures her father and corners her Nariko has no choice but to wield the sword to defend herself in order to escape. She takes a flying leap off a cliff edge as Bohan's archers begin firing at her. Kai finds Nariko after disobeying Shen's orders to hide and informs her of the temple where her father and clansmen are held captive. Nariko infiltrates the temple and is ambushed by Flying Fox. She defeats the general and continues on to rescue her father. Meanwhile, King Bohan plots to set up a trap for Nariko with Whiptail. Nariko falls into the trap, and Whiptail, after watching most of her personal guards defeated, tells Nariko the truth behind her father's original feelings about her birth - Shen wanted to kill Nariko shortly after her birth, but was unable to bring himself to do so. Nariko tells her father to leave her and fights with Whiptail. After Nariko impales Whiptail with the sword, King Bohan turns up and snaps Whiptail's neck in her dying moments, then captures the sword and an incapacitated Nariko. As Shen escapes, Kai makes her way to Nariko's cell. Kai is able to find where Nariko is imprisoned and begs that she comes home with her. Nariko explains to Kai that she needs to reacquire the Heavenly Sword to kill King Bohan. She asks Kai to retrieve the sword and Kai accepts the task. Kai succeeds in finding the Heavenly Sword, only to also discover her mother's skeleton. In a flashback, it is revealed that, some years ago, Kai's mother was murdered in front of her eyes by Flying Fox. Returning to the present, Kai is confronted by Flying Fox and barely manages to escape from him with the sword. Meanwhile, Nariko is forced by Bohan to fight before his army against Orangumen, pets of Roach's. During the battle, Kai arrives and throws Nariko the sword. When Nariko defeats all the Orangumen, Bohan orders Roach to murder Nariko. After defeating Roach, both Nariko and Kai flee from the pit. Bohan then commands Flying Fox to kill Kai while his soldiers take on Nariko. As the two try to escape, Flying Fox cuts Kai off from Nariko and they are separated. Nariko desperately tails Flying Fox, but when she finally catches up, he seemingly hangs Kai in front of her. Believing Kai dead, Nariko flies into a rage and battles with Flying Fox. As Nariko and Flying Fox duel, Kai, who survived the drop, uses her crossbow to shoot an arrow into Flying Fox's head, killing him. Nariko releases the injured Kai from the noose and returns her to the care of the clan. King Bohan rallies his men to launch a final attack to regain the Heavenly Sword. Nariko fights alongside her father and clansmen once more. Nariko kills countless numbers of Bohan's troops with ease and destroys his catapults. Despite her efforts, the sword kills her, bringing the events of the game full circle. But this time, Nariko reverses her death by making a pact with the sword to protect it from becoming a useless and dusty relic, since it needs her more than her clan needs it. Nariko returns as a goddess- like figure, and proceeds to slaughter Bohan's troops. Desperate, Bohan begs the Raven Lord (who has been seen repeatedly throughout the game watching Nariko or being with Bohan) to give him the power to destroy Nariko. Bohan gets his wish and the Raven Lord merges with him. An epic battle ensues similar to the one foretold in the prophecy. After Nariko manages to defeat Bohan, the raven leaves his body, and, despite Bohan begging for mercy, pecks his eyes out and flies away. As Nariko raises the sword to strike the final blow, Roach comes to his father's side and begs Nariko to let him take Bohan. Nariko relents, then Roach and Bohan leave, with Bohan calling Roach his son for the first time. Though successful in protecting the sword from coming into the hands of Bohan, Nariko still must give her life for wielding it, for that is the price for using the almighty sword, and the story comes to its end. Nariko reflects that she believes they have fought in vain for the prophecy, that the sword was not from Heaven, but feels gratified that she chose to be the one who was going to save her people from evil: she took the sword, paid the price and ultimately defeated Bohan's army, but nevertheless she was still a normal woman. Nariko heals Kai, and gives her the sword for safekeeping, before passing away. At the funeral, Nariko's body is placed into a boat filled with blossoms, and Kai and Shen cast her out to sea. Development Heavenly Sword began development in 2002 with footage of the original PC version published on TeamXbox in 2004. It had, at one time, been up and running on an early Xbox 360 prototype, but this was abandoned in favor of the PlayStation 3 when the title was picked up by SCEE. The game was developed using Havok Complete, a combination of Havok Physics and Havok Animation. Actor Andy Serkis performs as the voice and motion capture actor for King Bohan, one of the major characters in Heavenly Sword; he also acts as dramatic director for the game and is one of the writers of the story of the game. Nariko is voiced by Australian actress Anna Torv. Nariko's facial features are also based on Torv's, who participated in motion capture for the game in March 2007. A demo was released to the PlayStation Store on July 26, 2007 featuring a short, cinematic clip at the beginning and two brief enemy battles, lasting approximately five to ten minutes. An eight-second clip of the game was seen in an episode of the TV series Heroes entitled \\"Parasite\\", ostensibly being played by Jessica Sanders and her son, Micah. It featured Nariko running across ropes as they were cut by Bohan's soldiers, before landing on the platform to face them. While the episode was broadcast over four months before the actual release of the game, the level displayed remained in the released build, including the rope sequence shown; the icons in the final game used to inform the player which buttons to press were changed from large, central icons as seen in the clip, to be smaller and positioned at the bottom of the screen. Sony and Ninja Theory have made five 'making-of' videos about the production of Heavenly Sword, with each one detailing a certain aspect of the game's production, from music to motion capture. The videos can either be unlocked while playing the game or downloaded from the PlayStation Store. =Soundtrack= Nitin Sawhney composed the music for the soundtrack. It was performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Stephen Hussey. Tameem Antoniades of Ninja Theory said \\"we have our big orchestral soundtrack but we wanted to add a more ethnic element and marry those two together. There are actually very few musicians in the world who are experts in both areas. Nitin Sawhney is one of them.\\" Sawhney stated that his creation of \\"musical textures take in everything from Hollywood, European and Chinese cinema to Indian and middle eastern instrumentation through the orchestras and soloists hovering between sonic tidal waves and reflective moments of intimate grace.\\" Related media =Animated series= Nariko as represented in Part I of the animated series A series of Heavenly Sword animated episodes were released prior to the launch of the game itself, acting as a prequel to the events of the game. The series, which consists of five episodes, was produced by London production company Blinkink and animated by CHASE Animation Studios, headed by Robert Chandler. The videos were made available both online and through the PlayStation Store. The first two videos were also included on the retail version of the game; the latter three videos were not ready in time to be included. The style of the animated series differs from the graphics of the game itself. The animated series relies on a simple and stylized 2D look, which allowed director Ben Hibon to \\"create a complete visual re- interpretation of the world and its inhabitants\\". The videos were produced using a combination of Adobe Photoshop, Flash and After Effects. Initial reference frames were created with Photoshop, which were then animated in Flash and exported as separate layers into After Effects. The layers were composed onto a 3D stage with multiple foreground, middle ground and background elements, which allowed the use of 3D cameras and lighting to give depth and movement to the video. =Film= A computer generated animated film version, Heavenly Sword was produced, developed by Blockade Entertainment and scripted by writer Todd Farmer. The announced cast member are Anna Torv, returning as Nariko, Alfred Molina as King Bohan and Thomas Jane voicing Loki. The film was released on Blu-ray, DVD and on PlayStation Network on September 2, 2014. =Video game appearances= Nariko appears as a playable character in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, voiced by Jennifer Hale. Reception Heavenly Sword sold over one million copies by May 2008. Tameem Antoniades stated in March 2010 that sales were approximately one-and-a-half million but that the developer did not break even. The game was praised for its graphics and combat system, while criticism stemmed from the short length of the game and lack of online capabilities. It received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. USA Today gave the game nine stars out of ten, saying, \\"PlayStation 3 fans hungry for more satisfying first-party content from Sony will be satiated with the feverish pace Heavenly Sword provides.\\" Digital Spy gave it four stars out of five, saying, \\"The lavish sword combat system and the awesome presentation are what make this title a worthy buy. Sony seems to have created this game as a showcase for the PS3 and forgot about getting the gameplay up to scratch. But despite its failings, Heavenly Sword is a great buy for the excellent sword fighting sections and for those who simply want to show their friends just what the PS3 is capable of.\\" The New York Times gave it a favorable review, saying, \\"The scenery is breathtaking, battles can be exciting, and the intelligent, cruel King Bohan — voiced brilliantly by Andy Serkis (...) — is one of the best video game villains ever. The game is frustrating because it seems as if it should have been a great game and as if its creators tried to make it a great game, but it managed to be only a pretty good one.\\" Maxim gave it a score of six out of ten, saying, \\"A few of the puzzles are a total bitch, the button- press sequence/finishing moves that the game steals directly from God of War require too much precision, and the sniper sequences wind up being even more tedious than the fighting. It's fun for a little while, and very flashy, but in the end, for everything Heavenly Sword does right, it does two more things wrong.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and stated that \\"If Metal Gear Solid and Halo had acting this good, we'd be on to something.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the game a score of two sevens and two eights, for a total of 30 out of 40. GamesRadar featured Kai in the article \\"Freakish fashion\\" in 2007, and Nariko as a \\"game babe\\" sex symbol in 2007 and 2009. In 2009, MSN featured Nariko in the article \\"Gaming's Hottest Babes\\". UGO featured her among the \\"Top Animated Hotties\\" in 2008 and in their list of the best girls in video games in 2011, and also in the article \\"11 Strong Gaming Girls We Never Saw Again\\" in 2010. In 2010, Lisa Foiles of The Escapist ranked Nariko first in the \\"Top 5 Impractical Female Character Hairstyles\\". In 2013, she was ranked as the 18th greatest heroine in video game history by Complex. Cancelled sequel According to Ninja Theory co-founder Tameem Antoniades, the story for the sequel has already been written; in fact a whole trilogy is being planned. He stated, \\"We've had the story for the sequel for a while now. Hopefully, if this game is successful, then there's no reason why there shouldn't be a sequel and we'd very much like to go into that.\\"Heavenly Sword planned as trilogy, part two penned  Engadget On March 21, 2008, on G4's Attack of the Show it was listed on the scrolling banner that Ninja Theory is not planning to create a sequel for Heavenly Sword, and instead has decided to work on a new project (most likely Enslaved: Odyssey to the West). Though information on the decision and the aforementioned project was sparse, it was stated that production time for the new project will span well over two years, and that the project, like Heavenly Sword, will be extremely cinematic. Sony Computer Entertainment retains the intellectual property of Heavenly Sword, and there is always the possibility of production on a sequel being outsourced to another developer. In 2008, it was reported that a sequel to Heavenly Sword was in-development at SCE Cambridge Studio, but was canceled due to Sony no longer seeing it as a commercially viable product. Concept art for the title later surfaced in 2012.

Daniel Defoe commented: \\"the Distillers have found out a way to hit the palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd compound Waters called Geneva, so that the common People seem not to value the French- brandy as usual, and even not to desire it\\".The Complete English Tradesman, Vol. 2, Page 91 Daniel Defoe, 1727 Many people overconsumed and the city had an epidemic of extreme drunkenness; this provoked moral outrage and a legislative backlash that some compare to the modern drug wars. Parliament passed five major Acts, in 1729, 1736, 1743, 1747 and 1751, designed to control the consumption of gin. Though many similar drinks were available and alcohol consumption was considerable at all levels of society, gin caused the greatest public concern. Although it is commonly thought gin or Jenever was the singular drink, \\"gin\\" was a blanket statement for all grain-based alcohols at the time. Increased consumption of gin Gin was popularised in England following the accession of William of Orange in 1688. Gin provided an alternative to French brandy at a time of both political and religious conflict between Britain and France. Between 1689 and 1697, the Government passed a range of legislation aimed at restricting brandy imports and encouraging gin production. Most importantly, the monopoly of the London Guild of Distillers was broken in 1690, thereby opening up the market in gin distillation. The production and consumption of English gin, which was then popular amongst politicians and even Queen Anne, was encouraged by the government. This encouragement was shown in the reduced taxes on the distillation of spirits. Additionally, no licenses were needed to make spirits, so distillers of spirits could have smaller, more simple workshops than brewers, who were required to serve food and provide shelter for patrons. Economic protectionism was a major factor in beginning the Gin Craze; as the price of food dropped and income grew, consumers suddenly had the opportunity to spend excess funds on spirits. By 1721, however, Middlesex magistrates were already decrying gin as \\"the principal cause of all the vice & debauchery committed among the inferior sort of people\\". In a review of The Much-Lamented Death of Madam Geneva by Patrick Dillon. In 1736, the Middlesex Magistrates complained: > It is with the deepest concern your committee observe the strong Inclination > of the inferior Sort of People to these destructive Liquors, and how > surprisingly this Infection has spread within these few Years ... it is > scarce possible for Persons in low Life to go anywhere or to be anywhere, > without being drawn in to taste, and, by Degrees, to like and approve of > this pernicious Liquor.The Pamphleteer, Volume 29 By Abraham John Valpy Gin Acts of 1736 and 1751 The British government tried a number of times to stop the flow of gin. The Gin Act 1736 taxed retail sales at a rate of 20 shillings a gallon on spirits and required licensees to take out a £50 annual licence to sell gin, a fee equivalent to about £ today. The aim was to effectively prohibit the trade by making it economically unfeasible. Only two licences were ever taken out. The trade became illegal, consumption dipped but then continued to rise and the law was effectively repealed in 1743 following mass law-breaking and violence (particularly towards informers who were paid £5 to reveal the whereabouts of illegal gin shops). The illegally distilled gin which was produced following the 1736 Act was less reliable and more likely to result in poisoning. By 1743, England was drinking 2.2 gallons (10 litres) of gin per person per year. As consumption levels increased, an organised campaign for more effective legislation began to emerge, led by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Thomas Wilson, who, in 1736, had complained that gin produced a \\"drunken ungovernable set of people\\". Prominent anti-gin campaigners included Henry Fielding (whose 1751 \\"Enquiry into the Late Increase in Robbers\\" blamed gin consumption for both increased crime and increased ill health among children), Josiah Tucker, Daniel Defoe (who had originally campaigned for the liberalisation of distilling, but later complained that drunken mothers were threatening to produce a \\"fine spindle- shanked generation\\" of children), and – briefly – William Hogarth. Hogarth's engraving Gin Lane is a well known image of the gin craze, and is often paired with \\"Beer Street\\", creating a contrast between the miserable lives of gin drinkers and the healthy and enjoyable lives of beer drinkers. The Gin Craze began to diminish after the Gin Act 1751. This Act lowered the annual licence fees, but encouraged \\"respectable\\" gin selling by requiring licensees to trade from premises rented for at least £10 a year. Historians suggest that gin consumption was reduced not as a result of legislation but because of the rising cost of grain. Landowners could afford to abandon the production of gin, and this fact, coupled with population growth and a series of poor harvests, resulted in lower wages and increased food prices. The Gin Craze had mostly ended by 1757. The government tried to ensure this by temporarily banning the manufacture of spirits from domestic grain. There was a resurgence of gin consumption during the Victorian era, with numerous \\"Gin Palaces\\" appearing. In 1840, the amount of gin consumed in London (but by that time with a population in excess of one million) finally matched that from when prohibition ended in 1743.

In 1884, he moved to Lexington, Michigan, where he was a successful businessman owning several banks and extensive real estate. Sleeper also worked in mercantile industries. In 1901, he married Mary C. Moore. Sleeper served in the Michigan State Senate, 1901–1904. The following year, he became a member of the Republican State Committee until 1907. Then he served as State Treasurer of Michigan from 1909 to 1913 under Governors, Fred M. Warner and Chase Osborn. Sleeper was elected Governor of Michigan by a popular vote on November 7, 1916, defeating Democrat Edwin F. Sweet. He was re-elected to a second term in 1918. He served during most of World War I and started measures to supply men, provisions, and arms for the war effort. Also during his four years in office, a department of animal husbandry, a department of labor, and a public utilities commission were established. A county road system was advanced, a permanent state police department was founded, and the first driver's license was issued. Sleeper signed the State Parks Act creating the State Park system and an epidemic of the Spanish influenza was dealt with. On April 19, 1917, Governor Sleeper created the Michigan State Troops Permanent Force (Michigan State Police). In 1928, Sleeper served as a presidential elector for Michigan to elect Herbert Hoover as U.S. President. He died on May 13, 1934, in Lexington, Michigan, at the age of seventy-one and is interred at Lexington Municipal Cemetery.

It occurs in masses within the third geologic unit of the Kuroko type deposits within the mine. As a copper, iron sulfide, it is placed in the same group as bornite and chalcopyrite, and most fukuchilite locations are found in relatively close proximity to these minerals. Fukuchilite was found to have a reflection color very similar to bornite and bright pinkish brown in air, while being a purplish brown in oil.

Biography  Weisz's caricature of Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield Weisz was born in Berlin, Germany, to Hungarian-Jewish parents.Concise Dictionary of National Biography He studied at the Berlin School of Art and by 1928, at the age of fifteen, he was working as a freelancer, drawing caricatures. His father committed suicide that same year and Weisz began work with the journal 12 Uhr Blatt. His work also appeared in other German newspapers. Weisz's cartoons took a very strong anti-Nazi stance. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they took over the journal where Weisz worked. As a member of the Jewish community with expressed socialist opinions, Weisz decided to leave Germany. In 1935, he came to the United Kingdom, and worked for the News Chronicle, Daily Mirror and Evening Standard. He maintained an independent stance, whatever the political hue of his employers (Liberal, Labour and Conservative respectively), and built a reputation as an incisive commentator on political events. At the Daily Mirror, Weisz published the Nazi Nugget series. By the 1940s, Weisz, using the pseudonym \\"Vicky\\", was one of the leading British left-wing cartoonists. Weisz worked alongside fellow left-wing cartoonist Philip Zec at the Mirror and replaced him as the paper's chief political cartoonist in 1954. In the 1950s boom years, many observers felt that the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's demeanour as an Edwardian aristocrat was out of step with the times. \\"Vicky\\", as the lead political cartoonist of the News Chronicle, ridiculed him as 'Supermac', a spoof on the American comic-strip hero Superman. Contrary to the cartoonist's intention, the title Supermac benefited Macmillan, who went on to increase his parliamentary majority at the 1959 General Election. Earlier in the 1950s Vicky had produced some memorable cartoons of Macmillan's predecessor, Sir Anthony Eden, which made effective use of the Homburg hat that had been Eden's \\"trademark\\" in the 1930s. Victor Weisz followed his father in suffering from depression and insomnia; he committed suicide at his London home on 22 February 1966.

Active in athletics during his time as a student at Michigan State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University), and at the University of Michigan, Green earned a varsity letter playing for the Michigan State Normal football team in 1895 and is credited as the team's head coach during the 1896 season in which they were declared champions of the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Green served as a delegate to the 1932 and 1936 Republican National Conventions. Early life =Education and athletics= Green was born in Manistee, Michigan, and grew up in Cadillac, son of Holden Nathaniel Green and his wife Adaline Green (née Clark). His education was attained in Ypsilanti at Michigan State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University), where he graduated in 1893, and at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he earned a law degree in 1898. When Michigan State Normal joined the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1892, Green was selected as the school's first representative to the athletic conference. From 1893 to 1895, Green worked as a reporter in Ypsilanti. During this time, he continued his involvement in Michigan State Normal athletics, serving as \\"Manager of Foot Ball\\" for the Normal Athletic Association during the first term of 1893-94 academic year and as \\"Director of Sports\\" during the second term. In 1895, Green earned a varsity letter as a member of the Michigan State Normal football team. The following year, in 1896, he coached the football team to a 4-1 record. Michigan Normal was named the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association champions that season with a record of 2-0 in the conference. The team's sole loss came against the University of Michigan football team, the only team that scored against the Normalites that season. While a student at Michigan, Green was the \\"Class Athletic Manager\\" during the 1897-98 academic year. Head coaching record =Military service and legal work= Green served in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War. He was a first lieutenant in the 31st Michigan Volunteer Infantry and later was promoted to battalion adjutant. After the war, he returned to Ypsilanti as the city attorney, as well as attorney for the Ypsilanti Reed Furniture Company, a business he later owned in a partnership. His furniture company in Ionia was \\"one of the largest industries of its kind in the country\\". Politics In 1904, he moved the business to Ionia, Michigan. He was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Michigan in 1912, where U.S. President William Howard Taft was renominated. Green served as Mayor of Ionia from 1913 to 1916 and was instrumental in the establishing the Ionia Free Fair in 1915, which, at one time, was the world's largest free admission event of its kind. From 1915 to 1919, he was treasurer of the Michigan Republican Party. In 1920, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention that nominated Warren G. Harding for U.S. President. Pres. Gerald Ford (to highlight, click here) on Mackinac Island, Michigan (1929) On November 2, 1926, Green was elected Governor of Michigan. He was re-elected to a second two-year term in 1928. On May 18, 1927, the afternoon of the Bath School disaster, Green assisted in the relief work, carting bricks away from the scene. In 1928, he served as a delegate to the RNC which nominated Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover for president. Howard C. Lawrence was Green's secretary and business partner. During his administration, Green expanded a fish planting program and took part in the acquisition of seven state parks. He initiated a comprehensive budget system, authorized a new code of criminal practices, secured appropriations for a state hospital building program, and improved workmen's compensation. The Green administration was notably important in modernizing Michigan's highways. He is touted as the \\"inventor of the no passing lane\\", which was adopted as an important safety improvement throughout the country. He was also an early proponent of the Mackinac Bridge. On October 22, 1927, Governor Green participated in the dedication of the new University of Michigan Football Stadium: \\"Michigan Governor Fred W. Green and his Ohio counterpart Vince Donahey, and Presidents C. C. Little of Michigan and George W. Rightmire of Ohio, led the massed bands of the two universities onto the field from the east tunnel. The bands paraded to the flag pole where the national ensign was raised and the vast throng stood bareheaded during the playing of the 'Star Spangled Banner' and 'The Yellow and Blue.'\\" In 1927, he appointed Arthur Hendrick Vandenberg, who was editor of the Grand Rapids Herald, to the U.S. Senate to replace as the late Senator Woodbridge N. Ferris. He chose Vandenberg only when pressured to do so by the state Republican organization.LIFE: page 60, February 6, 1939, accessed January 10, 2011 In 1928, Green's campaign created the slogan \\"Keep Michigan Green\\" as a part of a fire prevention program. Retirement and death After leaving office, Green returned to his favorite pastime of hunting and fishing. In 1932, Green served as a delegate to the RNC which nominated Herbert Hoover for re-election, who was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1936, he again served as a delegate to the RNC which nominated Alf Landon for U.S. President, who was also unsuccessful at unseating Roosevelt. He was a Presbyterian and a member of the Freemasons, Elks and Rotary.

Specialists in industry seldom use the term cardboard because it does not denote a specific material. The term cardboard may refer to a variety of heavy paper-like materials, including, card stock, corrugated fiberboard, or paperboard. The meaning of the term may depend on the locale, contents, construction, and personal choice. Terminology Several types of containers are sometimes called cardboard box: File:Cream of Wheat.jpgA box or carton of cereal File:Pakje sigaretten.JPGHard cigarette pack or paperboard box File:Archive boxes.JPGCorrugated box used for storage of archives File:Yoohoo- boxes.jpgDrink boxes File:ErlebnisSennerei Zillertal Bergmilch.jpgMilk in gable-top carton File:White-Box-of-Chocolates.jpgSet-up box made of non- bending paperboard In business and industry, material producers, container manufacturers, packaging engineers, and standards organizations, try to use more specific terminology. There is still not complete and uniform usage. Often the term “cardboard” is avoided because it does not define any particular material. Broad divisions of paper-based packaging materials are: * Paper is thin material mainly used for writing upon, printing upon, or for packaging. It is produced by pressing together moist fibers, typically cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags, or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. * Paperboard, sometimes known as cardboard, is generally thicker (usually over 0.25 mm or 10 points) than paper. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a basis weight (grammage) above 224 g/m², but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply. * Corrugated fiberboard sometimes known as corrugated board or corrugated cardboard, is a combined paper-based material consisting of a fluted corrugated medium and one or two flat liner boards. There are also multiple names for containers: * A shipping container made of corrugated fiberboard is sometimes called a \\"cardboard box\\", a \\"carton\\", or a \\"case\\". There are many options for corrugated box design. * A folding carton made of paperboard is sometimes called a \\"cardboard box\\". * A set-up box is made of a non-bending grade of paperboard and is sometimes called a \\"cardboard box\\". * Drink boxes made of paperboard laminates, are sometimes called \\"cardboard boxes\\", \\"cartons\\", or \\"boxes\\". History The first commercial paperboard (not corrugated) box is sometimes credited to Cronchuck in England in 1817. Marketing Communications, Volume 6, Issues 7-12, United Business Publications (1981). \\"Reportedly, the oldest known box-making business was formed in Great Britain about 1817.\\" Stanley Sacharow and Roger C. Griffin (1970), Food packaging: a guide for the supplier, processor, and distributor, AVI Pub. Co. \\"Commercial box making is supposed to have begun in England in 1817.\\" Cardboard box packaging was made the same year in Germany. Chuck Groth (), Exploring Package Design, Cengage Learning. p. 7. \\"The oldest existing cardboard box package design was produced in Germany for a board game called 'The Game of Besieging,' in 1817. Still, paper and cardboard were relative luxuries.\\" The Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut cardboard or paperboard box in 1890 – flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: he was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and one day, while he was printing an order of seed bags, a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes. Applying this idea to corrugated boxboard was a straightforward development when the material became available around the turn of the twentieth century. Cardboard boxes were developed in France about 1840 for transporting the Bombyx mori moth and its eggs by silk manufacturers, and for more than a century the manufacture of cardboard boxes was a major industry in the Valréas area. The advent of lightweight flaked cereals increased the use of cardboard boxes. The first to use cardboard boxes as cereal cartons was the Kellogg Company. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper was patented in England in 1856, and used as a liner for tall hats, but corrugated boxboard was not patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single-sided (single-face) corrugated board. Jones used the corrugated board for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated board was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones's design by inventing corrugated board with liner sheets on both sides. This was corrugated cardboard as we know it today. The first corrugated cardboard box manufactured in the US was in 1895. By the early 1900s, wooden crates and boxes were being replaced by corrugated paper shipping cartons. By 1908, the terms \\"corrugated paper-board\\" and \\"corrugated cardboard\\" were both in use in the paper trade. Crafts and entertainment Cardboard and other paper-based materials (paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, etc.) can have a post-primary life as a cheap material for the construction of a range of projects, among them being science experiments, children's toys, costumes, or insulative lining. Some children enjoy playing inside boxes. A common cliché is that, if presented with a large and expensive new toy, a child will quickly become bored with the toy and play with the box instead. Although this is usually said somewhat jokingly, children certainly enjoy playing with boxes, using their imagination to portray the box as an infinite variety of objects. One example of this in popular culture is from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, whose protagonist, Calvin, often imagined a cardboard box as a \\"transmogrifier\\", a \\"duplicator\\", or a time machine. So prevalent is the cardboard box's reputation as a plaything that in 2005 a cardboard box was added to the National Toy Hall of Fame in the US, one of very few non-brand- specific toys to be honoured with inclusion. As a result, a toy \\"house\\" (actually a log cabin) made from a large cardboard box was added to the Hall, housed at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. The Metal Gear series of stealth video games has a running gag involving a cardboard box as an in-game item, which can be used by the player to try to sneak through places without getting caught by enemy sentries. Housing and furniture Living in a cardboard box is stereotypically associated with homelessness. However, in 2005, Melbourne architect Peter Ryan designed a house composed largely of cardboard. More common are small seatings or little tables made from corrugated cardboard. Merchandise displays made of cardboard are often found in self-service shops. Cushioning by crushing Mass and viscosity of the enclosed air help together with the limited stiffness of boxes to absorb the energy of oncoming objects. In 2012, British stuntman Gary Connery safely landed via wingsuit without deploying his parachute, landing on a high crushable \\"runway\\" (landing zone) built with thousands of cardboard boxes.

(NASA appropriated the name for its Space Shuttle Program, the only component of the proposal to survive Congressional funding approval). The purpose of the system was two-fold: to reduce the cost of spaceflight by replacing the current method of launching capsules on expendable rockets with reusable spacecraft; and to support ambitious follow-on programs including permanent orbiting space stations around the Earth and Moon, and a human landing mission to Mars. In February 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed a Space Task Group headed by Vice President Spiro Agnew to recommend human space projects beyond Apollo. The group responded in September with the outline of the STS, and three different program levels of effort culminating with a human Mars landing by 1983 at the earliest, and by the end of the twentieth century at the latest. The system's major components consisted of: * A permanent space station module designed for 6 to 12 occupants, in a low Earth orbit, and as a permanent lunar orbit station. Modules could be combined in Earth orbit to create a 50 to 100 person permanent station. * A chemically fueled Earth-to- station shuttle. * A chemically fueled space tug to move crew and equipment between Earth orbits as high as geosynchronous orbit, which could be adapted as a lunar orbit-to-surface shuttle. * A nuclear-powered ferry using the NERVA engine, to move crew, spacecraft and supplies between low Earth orbit and lunar orbit, geosynchronous orbit, or to other planets in the solar system. The tug and ferry vehicles would be of a modular design, allowing them to be clustered and/or staged for large payloads or interplanetary missions. The system would be supported by permanent Earth and lunar orbital propellant depots.Space Task Group Report, \\"Program Objectives\\", 4.b. The Saturn V might still have been used as a heavy lift launch vehicle for the nuclear ferry and space station modules. A special \\"Mars Excursion Module\\" would be the only remaining vehicle necessary for a human Mars landing. As Apollo accomplished its objective of landing the first men on the Moon, political support for further manned space activities began to wane, which was reflected in unwillingness of the Congress to provide funding for most of these extended activities. Based on this, Nixon rejected all parts of the program except the Space Shuttle, which inherited the STS name. As funded, the Shuttle was greatly scaled back from its planned degree of reusability, and deferred in time. The Shuttle first flew in 1981, and was retired in 2011. A second part of the system, Space Station Freedom, was approved in the early 1980s and announced in 1984 by president Ronald Reagan. However, this also became politically unviable by 1993, and was replaced with the International Space Station (ISS), with substantial contribution by Russia. The ISS was completed in 2010. 1969 Space Task Group System vehicles =Earth-to-orbit shuttle= Early North American Rockwell shuttle concept, 1969 =Space tug= 1971 Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) concept drawing of the space tug =Nuclear ferry= 1971 MSFC drawing illustrates use of the nuclear shuttle (ferry) for lunar orbit, or Mars orbit missions Planned uses for NERVA included a visit to Mars by 1978 and a permanent lunar base by 1981.

The Year of Assessment (YA) is based on the calendar year commencing 1 January to 31 December, and is payable on a preceding year basis, whereby taxes payable per year of assessment is based on income earned in the preceding calendar year. Taxation is based on the source principle, in which only income earned at source, in this case in Singapore, or those derived from overseas but received in Singapore, are taxable. Any income arising from sources outside Singapore and received in Singapore on or after 1 January 2004 by an individual (other than partners of a partnership) is exempt from tax. This system has the potential to allow for tax avoidance practiced by individuals who derive income from abroad, gain tax exemptions via their non-resident status there, and use this income outside Singapore. Expatriates and foreign workers in Singapore are also liable for paying income tax. Corporate income tax Corporate income tax like individual income tax is payable on annual basis. However, foreign income earned by a Singapore company may require dual taxation once in the income origin country and in Singapore. In such a case, companies can claim Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) payable on the same income.

However, the number of cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually. There is no product or method which assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However, there are a number of treatment modalities that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air, and silicone-based lotions. Treatment is recommended only after a clear diagnosis since all treatments have potential side effects. Louse eggs hatch 6–9 days after oviposition. Therefore, a common recommendation is to repeat treatment with a pediculicide at least once after 10 days, when all lice have hatched. Between the two treatments (Days 2–9) the person will still be infested with lice that hatch from eggs not killed by the anti-louse product. Between the treatments, it is advised to wet the hair and comb daily with a louse-comb to remove the hatching lice. If no living lice are found, the treatment was successful, even if nits (eggs) are visible on the hair. If living lice are still present, the treatment is repeated using an anti-louse product with a different active ingredient. This is kept in the hair for 2 hours and then rinsed out, with the head and hair cleaned before sleep. Prophylactic treatment with pediculicides is not recommended. Medications Insecticides used for the treatment of head lice include lindane, malathion, carbaryl, pyrethrum, piperonyl butoxide, permethrin, phenothrin, bioallethrin, and spinosad.Pediculus humanus, human louse Many of the pediculicides in the market are either not fully effective or are ineffective when they are used according to the instructions. Pediculicides may rapidly lose their efficacy because of the development of resistance. Resistance of head lice to insecticides such as lindane, malathion, phenothrin and permethrin has been reported. Ivermectin by mouth has been shown to reduce levels of louse infestation. Ivermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediculosis.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/202736s000lbl.pdf Agents approved by the FDA for treatment of pediculosis include abametapir, topical ivermectin lotion, lindane, malathion, permethrin, and piperonyl butoxide with pyrethrins. Heated air A heated air device designed by Larada Sciences to kill headlice by drying A standard home blow dryer will kill 96.7% of eggs with proper technique. To be effective, the blow dryer must be used repeatedly (every 1 to 7 days since eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days) until the natural life cycle of the lice is over (about 4 weeks). A number of commercial head lice treatment companies across the country offer a heated air treatment. Combing The delousing by Adriaen Brouwer A special fine-toothed comb that can pick out lice is used. For a treatment with louse comb alone, it is recommended to comb the hair for an hour to an hour and a half (depending the length and type of the hair) daily or every second day for 14 days. Wetting the hair especially with water and shampoo or conditioner will facilitate the combing and the removal of lice, eggs and nits. Electronic louse combs use a small electrical charge to kill lice. The metal teeth of the comb have alternating positively and negatively charged tines, which are powered by a small battery. When the comb is used on dry hair, lice make contact with multiple tines of the fine-toothed comb, thereby closing the circuit and receiving an electrical charge. A non-peer-reviewed letter has been published in a dermatology journal claiming effectiveness based on personal experience (total of 6 uses). For those with long or fine hair, the metal long tooth combs seem to snag and pull hair. Metal combs may be better for thick hair, while plastic short-tooth combs are best used for treating long and fine hair. Procedures Shaving the head or cutting the hair extremely short can be used to control lice infestation. Short hair, baldness, or a shaven scalp are generally seen as a preventive measure against louse infestation. This will also eliminate – particularly if maintained for the length of the parasites' reproductive cycle – louse infestation. Infestation with lice is not a disease and the medical symptoms are normally minimal. In any case, health providers and parents should try not to create emotional problems for children during examination and treatment. Shaving of the area above and behind the ears and the upper part of the neck while leaving the crown of the head with hair is commonly used to prevent lice among tribes in Africa, Asia, and America (in America – Mohawk style). School treatment Head louse nits on human hair Schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. This is the basis of the \\"no-nit policy\\". Data from a primarily American study during 1998–1999 found that no-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation. A separate 1998 survey revealed that 60% of American school nurses felt that \\"forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea.\\" A number of health researchers and organizations object to the no-nit policy. Opponents to the no-nit policy mention that visible nits may only be empty egg casings which pose no concern as transmission can only occur via live lice or eggs. This has led to the perception that the no-nit policy serves only to ease the workload of school nurses and punish the parents of infested children. Proponents of the no-nit policy counter that only a consistently nit-free child can be reliably shown to be infestation-free. That is, the presence of nits serves as an indirect proxy for infestation status. Proponents argue that such a proxy is necessary because lice screening is prone to false negative conclusions (i.e., failure to find lice present on actively infested children). For example, a 1998 Israeli study found that 76% of live lice infestations were missed by visual inspection (as verified by subsequent combing methods). Although lice cannot fly or jump, they are fast and agile in their native environment (i.e., clinging to hairs near the warmth of the scalp), and will try to avoid the light used during inspection. Louse colonies are also sparse (often fewer than 10 lice), which can contribute to difficulty in finding live specimens. Further, lice populations consist predominantly of immature nymphs, which are even smaller and harder to detect than adult lice. Alternative medicine Tea tree oil has been promoted as a treatment for head lice; however, evidence of its effectiveness is weak. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and because of a lack of knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or melted butter in the hair have been partially disproven, The use of plastic bags may be dangerous. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that swimming has no effect on treating lice, and can in fact harm the treatment by commercial products. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, common alcohol) is toxic to arthropods including lice and an external application of it is harmless to humans.JF Marriott. 2010.

Since 1989, there have been at least nine cases of children being severely burned during such attempts. These cases apparently occurred because, contrary to popular belief, it is the fumes of the gasoline, rather than the liquid itself, that are flammable. These fumes can ignite due to the presence of even a small spark or open flame - such as those caused by electrical appliances, cigarette lighters, or pilot lights in stoves and water heaters. The use of gasoline to treat lice also carries a high risk of dermatitis (i.e. irritation of the scalp).Gasoline Lice Treatment at snopes.com.

Originally, torchères were candelabra, usually with two or three lights. When it was first introduced in France towards the end of the 17th century the torchère mounted one candle only, and when the number was doubled or tripled the improvement was regarded almost as a revolution in the lighting of large rooms. Background Today, torchère lamps use fluorescent or halogen light bulbs. By adjusting the pulse- width modulation in the electronic ballast can allow the fluorescent torchères to be dimmed. Halogen torchères usually came with a simple switch. Some more expensive models have a TRIAC dimmer circuit built into the stem. Early lamps with 300W bulbs tended to fail quickly. Retrofitting the lamp with a 100W bulb resulted in a substantial improvement in bulb life with minimal loss in brightness. Halogen torchères have been banned in some places, such as dormitories, because of the large numbers of fires they have caused. The torchère was held responsible by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission for 100 fires and 10 deaths since 1992.

During his career, he covered crises, war, and unrest in 67 countries.Gottlieb, Hooper. Shearer, Benjamin F. ed., Home Front Heroes, Greenwood Publishing (2007) p. 760, Simon reported the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam, the Israeli-Lebanese Conflict in 1982, and the student protests in China's Tiananmen Square in 1989. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he and four of his TV crew were captured and imprisoned by Iraq for 40 days. He published a book about the experience titled \\"Forty Days.\\" He became a regular correspondent for CBS's 60 Minutes in 1996 and, in 1999, for 60 Minutes II. At the time of his death in an auto accident, he served as 60 Minutes senior foreign correspondent. Simon is described as having been \\"a giant of broadcast journalism\\" by CBS News President David Rhodes, and is recognized as one of the few journalists who have covered most of the major overseas conflicts since 1969. For his extensive reporting over a 47-year career, he earned more than 40 major awards, including the Overseas Press Club award and 27 Emmy Awards for journalism. On February 11, 2015, Simon was severely injured in a car accident in Manhattan, New York. He was transported to St. Luke's–Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West), where he was pronounced dead. Early life and education Simon was born to a Jewish family in The Bronx in New York City. In 1962, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brandeis University with a degree in history. From 1964 to 1967, Simon served as an American Foreign Service officer and was a Fulbright Scholar in France and a Woodrow Wilson scholar. From 1969 to 1971, he worked at the CBS News London bureau, and from 1971 to 1977, was based in the London and Saigon bureaus, where he worked as a Vietnam War correspondent. From 1977 to 1981, he was assigned to the CBS News Tel Aviv bureau. Career Simon began reporting news in 1969, during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. In Vietnam he began reporting the war in 1971; for his reports of Hanoi's Easter Offensive, he won an Overseas Press Club award. He won another as part of the team that covered the final six weeks of U.S. involvement, where he boarded one of the last helicopters to leave in 1975. In subsequent years, he reported from war zones in Grenada, Somalia and Haiti. He was in Poland during martial law, with Israeli troops during the Israel- Lebanon, and in Egypt following the uprisings in 2011.

During the opening days of the Gulf War in January 1991, Simon and his CBS News team were captured by Iraqi forces and spent 40 days in an Iraqi prison, most of it in solitary confinement. Simon later said that it was a \\"careless mistake\\" for him and his crew to have crossed the border, and he chronicled the experience in the book Forty Days.\\"A 'Most Searing Experience': Television: Bob Simon relives his 40 days as Iraq's hostage during the Gulf War in new book.\\", Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1992 In 1996, Simon joined 60 Minutes as a correspondent, and he was also a correspondent for seven seasons on 60 Minutes II, from January 1999 to June 2005, after which he became a full-time correspondent.Bob Simon: 60 Minutes, CBS News correspondent bio., CBS News, June 24, 2014 His coverage of foreign events was broadcast on all CBS News shows and earned him more than 40 major awards, including the Overseas Press Club's highest honor for a body of work, the President's Award.

Kate Van Orden points out a precedent in Clément Janequin's \\"La Guerre\\" (1528).

Monteverdi wrote the following: > “I have reflected that the principal passions or affections of our mind are > three, namely, anger, moderation, and humility or supplication. . . The art > of music also points clearly to these three in its terms “agitated,” “soft,” > and “moderate” (concitato, molle, and temperato). In all the works of former > composers I have indeed found examples of the “soft” and the “moderate,” but > never of the “agitated.\\" Monteverdi developed the musical style of stile concitato to represent the human emotion of agitation. He considered Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, one of the pieces from Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi, to be the first instance of stile concitato. Stile concitato is represented musically in Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda through the rapid repetition of sixteenth notes.

Though this was once a popular profession, the importance of bows, as well as that of their makers, was diminished over time by the introduction of gunpowder weaponry. However, the trade has survived and, to this day, many bowyers continue to practice their craft. Freshly cut wood split into bow staves.  History  Historically, a wide variety of bows have been produced for purposes ranging from food gathering and warfare to recreation. Who created these bows depended mainly on the type of bow being produced, but also on the quantity required. The skills required tend to divide traditional bowyers into two groups: = Makers of self bows = In clans or social groups that used wooden self bows (bows made entirely from one piece of wood) bows would sometimes be crafted by the individual user; however, even with fairly simple bow designs it was often easier to rely upon a few skilled bowyers within the group. By working in groups more could be accomplished. In medieval England, for example, professional bowyers produced thousands of bows required for that country’s military. These bowyers could reportedly make an English longbow in as little as two hours. Wooden selfbows normally take from 5–15 hours of work depending on the skill of the bowyer and the challenges set by the piece of wood. Modern amateurs find it satisfying to make functional self bows with beginner's skills and few tools. = Makers of composite bows = Cultures that used composite bows (bows made of several materials, classically horn, wood, and sinew) had to rely on skilled craftsmen. Composite bows could be made relatively short, heavily recurved, and highly effective but the constituent materials had to be put under enormous stress and the bow’s limbs needed to be perfectly aligned. These demands required experienced bowyers who were willing to spend a great deal of time crafting their weapons. Cultures such as the Mongols made effective military use of powerful composite bows for millennia; the limited records indicate that only a minority of men in these cultures ever made bows.  Bowyers in the United States  In the United States, many bowyers were inspired by Ishi, the last member of the Yahi, who lived most of his life outside modern culture. Ishi first contacted US citizens in 1911. His friend Saxton Pope learned some of his skills and spread them to bowyers including Howard Hill, Ben Pearson and Fred Bear.

The game was released at various dates, varying between continents. The game was released in Japan on March 23, 2006; in North America and Australia during 2006 and in Europe in April 2007. It was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on February 25, 2016. Pokémon Ranger is compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver allowing players to transfer the egg of the legendary Pokémon Manaphy to those games. This game is set in the Fiore region. Gameplay Pokémon Ranger is a role-playing game which is designed in a format radically different from that of traditional Pokémon RPGs. The player controls a Pokémon Ranger in the Fiore region and catches Pokémon, temporarily, by using a device called a \\"capture styler\\", which is controlled by the stylus. The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions with three sub-missions. The only Pokémon that travels permanently with the player is a Minun if the player chooses the male hero or Plusle if the player chooses the female hero. The player must loop the Pokémon with the \\"styler\\" a certain number of times to capture them. Pokémon may attempt to flee the styler or attack it. The styler has an energy bar that is similar to an HP counter for Pokémon on the other Pokémon adventure games, when the energy bar of the styler is completely depleted, the player is transported to the last save terminal. The styler can be recharged in a Pokémon center like manner at a ranger base, save points are in the bases and scattered throughout the game. There is a quick save option to use in emergencies when a save port can't be found or is too far away. Temporarily caught Pokémon can be used in the field to accomplish tasks and solve puzzles by cutting, tackling, shooting fire, blowing water, etc. They can also be used to enhance the styler's loop line. For example, if a water Pokémon is selected to aid in capturing a new Pokémon, the styler will produce a temporary bubble that immobilizes the target, preventing it from attacking or fleeing. Plot =Setting= Pokémon Ranger is set in the Fiore region. The region's name originates from the Italian word for flower. The Go-Rock Squad is the resident crime syndicate of this region. Fiore itself does not have any native Pokémon, but has many Pokémon from other regions. It also does not have any Pokémon Trainers. All people who live with Pokémon keep them outside of Poké Balls, like pets, as Pokémon are never trained here. Fiore is located quite some distance from the other regions of the Pokémon world up to the third generation. It is a relatively small island region that is quite mountainous. There are four major settlements in Fiore, each named after the season it constantly experiences — Ringtown (spring) to the west, Fall City (fall) to the east, Wintown (winter) at foot of mountains to the north and Summerland (summer) on an island to the south. The Krokka Tunnel connects Fall City and Ringtown. From there, one can also get to the Panula Cave, which is also accessible from Summerland's harbor via water vehicle (aka the AquaMole), the coldest spot of the Fiore region, hence ice Pokémon appearing there, including the legendary Regice. It leads to Wintown, located on the foot of the Sekra Range. The Sekra Range is a mountain range that is notable for having a waterfall that can \\"fill the Capture Arena 23 times in one minute\\"; housing the Go-Rock Squad's base; a house high up where the residents inside will recharge the player's Styler; \\"Shiftree\\", a tree where five Shiftry live in and will attack the player all at the same time; and the Fiore Temple, an ancient temple mountain currently home to a lot of wild Pokémon, but with a strange door that will only open when you capture the 3 wanted Pokémon; where the game's climax takes place, located at the very summit of the Sekra Range. On the same island where Summerland is located on is a big jungle called the Olive Jungle. Numerous Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon live here, and in the center is a ruin, with the same symbols on Kyogre, called the Jungle Relic. In the past, Rangers came to the Relic to test themselves. There are four Challenges involving Dragon Pokémon, each representing one of the four classical elements: the Challenge of Destruction (Earth), the Challenge of Wind (Air), the Challenge of Fire and the Challenge of Water. These Pokémon are Flygon, Salamence, Charizard, and Kingdra respectively, as on the cover of Pokémon Ranger. It is said that should all four be cleared, a catastrophe will befall Fiore. After beating the game, the player may roam around free to do almost anything. There is also the Ranger Net for special missions after the main missions. In these missions, the main character is required to capture 3 legendary Pokémon not seen anywhere else in the game; Deoxys, Celebi, and Mew. If the code for the special Manaphy mission is unlocked, it can be used to get the Manaphy Egg, which can later be transferred to Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. =Characters= The storyline revolves around a single Pokémon Ranger — Lunick or Solana, depending on the player's choice. In addition to the protagonist characters in the game, several other Pokémon Rangers are part of the Ranger Union. Each ranger leader holds domain over that town's rangers. These rangers are named Cameron, Elita, Joel, and Spenser. A professor named Professor Hastings also plays a significant role in the game, as the Chief of Technology for the Ranger Union. The new villainous group, the Go-Rock Squad, has four sub-leaders called the Go-Rock Quads, the leader's three sons and daughter. The Quads have a motto they repeat every time they are encountered. Their original plot is to use the Super Styler, a more powerful version of the original Styler that resembles an organ, to take control of Entei, Suicune, and Raikou to attack citizens of Fiore. They would then command them to stop, leading people to believe the Go-Rock Squad were heroes. They would afterwards command Pokémon to start other problems and charge money to solve the problem. The player is then required to prove their worth in three extra post ending missions and capture the enraged legendaries; Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza. Development Information regarding Pokémon Ranger was published in the July 2005 issue of CoroCoro Comic magazine. Little details were shared, which mostly hinted that it was a game and a movie. An announcement on Pokémon Ranger came as a short teaser at the end of the 8th Pokémon film, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. This game's development was confused for being the same game as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. =Promotion= A few episodes of the Pokémon animated series have included Pokémon Rangers. They go on special missions to help preserve Pokémon and human relations, and they are closely related to Pokémon breeders. They also have a device that allows them to temporarily control wild Pokémon; this device also allows them to scan Pokémon, check how healthy they are, and make sure that they are not being interfered with by outside forces. Solana herself has appeared in three episodes of the Pokémon anime, in one of which Solana must stop a disturbed Deoxys. Several Pokémon Rangers can also be battled in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, FireRed and LeafGreen, Emerald, Diamond and Pearl, Platinum, Black and White and are depicted as protecting the environment and wild Pokémon. These Rangers own Pokémon which they keep in Poké Balls, and are not true rangers but still have similar intentions to true Pokémon Rangers. A direct- to-DVD animated film adaptation Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea premièred on Cartoon Network on March 23, 2007 and released on DVD the succeeding month. The movie starred a new Ranger named Jack Walker, or Jackie, whose job is to protect a Legendary Manaphy Egg which Ash and company also help in protecting. =Merchandise= A game watch has been manufactured in the theme of Pokémon Ranger. The watch is designed to look like the Pokémon Rangers' Capture Styler used for capturing Pokémon. The Pokémon can be used to help the styler by making bubbles or having leaf blades shoot out or having it on fire. Reception Pokémon Ranger sold 193,337 copies in Japan on its release week.GAF - News - Japan: Weekly software sales for 3/20 - 3/26 In terms of games reviews, Pokémon Ranger received fairly positive reaction, with a 70% ratio from GameRankings. IGN gave the game an overall score of 7.1 out of 10, citing the presentation, gameplay and graphics as the game's strong points but also citing the game's use of sound as a major drawback, with issues such as the game's use of the 8-bit sounds from the original Game Boy games as Pokémon cries. A lack of a multi-player mode was also a negative point in IGN's review. GameSpot gave a similar review to IGN, giving the game a 7.5 out of 10 overall. GameSpot commented that the game's \\"unique capturing system\\", \\"good-sized quest\\" and \\"attractive 2D graphics and animation\\" were the games good points while also commenting that issues such as possible scratching of the touch screen during capture and \\"basic exploration sequences\\" were the games notable bad points. While discussing the mixed quality of Pokémon spin-offs, Retronauts podcaster Jeremy Parish cited Pokémon Ranger as an example, with Parish later referring to it as \\"crappy\\". He cites the dialogue and story, commenting that while Pokémon was a kiddy game, the writing in Ranger is worse than in the main games. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized HAL Laboratory, which he says is normally a good developer, for making Ranger. As of March 31, 2008, Pokémon Ranger has sold 2.70 million copies worldwide. Sequels =Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia= Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia is the sequel to Pokémon Ranger, and is developed by Creatures Inc. for the Nintendo DS video game console.

The dam is operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the early 1940s to accommodate the skyrocketing electricity demands in the Tennessee Valley at the height of World War II. At high, Fontana is the tallest dam in the Eastern United States, and at the time of its construction, it was the fourth tallest dam in the world.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Fontana Project: A Comprehensive Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, and Initial Operations of the Fontana Project, Technical Report No. 12 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1950), pp. 1-13, 43-45, 453. The dam and associated infrastructure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. The dam impounds the Fontana Lake, which spreads across a scenic stretch of the Little Tennessee along the southwestern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Appalachian Trail crosses the top of the dam. Fontana is named for the now-inundated town of Fontana, a lumber and copper-mining hub once located at the mouth of Eagle Creek. The town's name was derived from the Italian word for \\"fountain.\\"Duane Oliver, Hazel Creek From Then Till Now (Maryville, Tenn.: Stinnett Printing, 1989), p. 69. Location The Little Tennessee River flows for from its source in the mountains of northern Georgia to its mouth along the Tennessee River opposite Lenoir City, Tennessee. Fontana is located above the mouth of the Little Tennessee, in a remote area where the westward-flowing river bends briefly to the south. Fontana Dam is a drive from the three nearest cities -- Maryville, Tennessee to the west, Bryson City, North Carolina to the east, and Robbinsville, North Carolina, to the south, although the small resort of Fontana Village (which has its roots as the temporary village where many of the workers constructing the dam were housed) has developed just south of the dam. The Great Smoky Mountains rise to the north, and the Yellow Creek Mountains (mostly protected by the Nantahala National Forest) rise to the south. Fontana is the uppermost of five dams on the Little Tennessee River, with Cheoah Dam being downstream, followed by Calderwood Dam, Chilhowee Dam, and Tellico Dam. Fontana's spillway in operation Along with a stretch of the Little Tennessee, Fontana Lake also extends across the lower of the Tuckasegee River (which flows southward from Cherokee and Bryson City) and the lower or so of the Nantahala River, extending into the scenic Nantahala Gorge. Several rapid-flowing mountain streams-- some of which drop several thousand feet from the crest of the Great Smokies in just a few miles-- empty into Fontana's north shore. The most notable of these streams -- Eagle Creek and Hazel Creek -- form substantial embayments just upstream from the dam. North Carolina Highway 28 (which crosses a bridge downstream from the dam) provides the only major road access to the Fontana Dam area. At Deals Gap, west of the dam, the road intersects U.S. Route 129, which then continues westward to Maryville. East of the dam, NC-28 follows the lake's south shore for about before intersecting U.S. Route 74. The Fontana Dam site previously hosted an narrow gauge funicular railway for tourists.Image of the incline railway Capacity Fontana Dam is 2,365 feet (721 m) long and 480 feet (146 m) high, making it the tallest dam in the Eastern United States. The dam has a flood storage capacity of , and the combined capacity of its three generators is 293.6 megawatts. Fontana Lake has of shoreline and of water surface, and its surface elevation varies by annually.Tennessee Valley Authority, Fontana Reservoir. Retrieved: 12 January 2009. Background and construction Design plan for Fontana Dam, circa 1941 The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) began investigating the Little Tennessee Valley around 1910 in hopes of finding a power source for the massive amounts of electricity needed at its aluminum production operations at nearby Alcoa, Tennessee. In 1913, Alcoa purchased the Tallassee Power Company (now Tapoco), and by 1930 the two entities had completed Cheoah and Calderwood dams, as well as Santeetlah Dam on the Cheoah River. By the mid-1930s, Alcoa had assessed the Fontana site and had purchased the initial for the dam's construction. In 1935, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which was concerned with the Little Tennessee's effect on flood control in the greater Tennessee Valley, began negotiating with Alcoa to assume control of the Fontana project. Although Alcoa preferred that TVA build the dam, TVA was unable to get necessary funding for the project until the outbreak of World War II in 1941, when emergency wartime initiatives called for a drastic increase in aluminum production. On August 14, 1941, TVA and ALCOA signed the \\"Fontana Agreement,\\" which gave TVA possession of Fontana and control over the releases and output of Tapoco's Little Tennessee Valley dams, and in return guaranteed that Alcoa would be the primary benefactor of the dams' electrical output for at least twenty years. The U.S. Congress authorized funding on December 17, 1941, and construction of Fontana Dam began on January 1, 1942. \\"Fontana Dam. Power to win.\\" World War II poster The building of Fontana Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which were forested and had to be cleared. 1,311 families, 1,047 graves, and over of roads had to be relocated. The towns of Fontana, Bushnell, Forney, and Judson were completely inundated. The village of Welch Cove (later renamed Fontana Village) was constructed just south of the dam to house the project's workers, whose numbers had reached 5,000 by 1943 in spite of nationwide manpower shortages. Fontana Village is now a summer resort and still has some of the original buildings. The design of the dam was unusual for TVA at the time. It was feared that the 2,818,000 yd³ (2,155,000 m³) of concrete required for the dam would create a structure so massive, that heat released during its setting would be trapped for years, and would eventually cause cracks to form. To aid the release of this heat, engineers divided the dam into construction joints and outfitted them with grout pipes and cooling coils. The dam's spillway presented another problem, as engineers were worried that the water's drop would cause erosion issues at the dam's foundation. A special spillway was thus designed that drains water out through two 34-foot (10.3 m) diameter spill pipes into a diversion tunnel equipped with a deflection system. The dam's design is largely the work of TVA chief architect Roland Wank. Fontana Dam was completed at a cost of $70,420,688.48, and the gates closed on November 11, 1944. Two generating units were placed in operation on January 20, 1945, in time to provide crucial energy for aluminum production in the closing months of World War II. Over along Fontana Lake's north shore were eventually transferred to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several thousand acres along the south shore were transferred to the U.S. Forest Service. = Cracks in the dam = Despite the innovative design of the dam, cracks were observed in the face of the dam in 1949. In 1972, additional cracks appeared and started to expand in 1973. Following extensive investigations, it was determined that the cracks were caused by stresses in the curved portions of dam from thermal expansion. The cracking was exacerbated by alkali-aggregate reaction, which causes the concrete volume to increase and develop additional stresses. The area around the crack was post- tensioned with steel tendons, and an expansion slot was made in 1976 to alleviate the stresses developed within the cracked area. New slot cuts are made every 4–5 years to stop its growth.https://www.tva.gov/Newsroom/Good- Medicine-for-Fontana-Dam The last cuts were performed by Bluegrass companies in 2016.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6uGRp5BKM North Shore Road controversy The construction of Fontana Dam led to the flooding of most of North Carolina Highway 288, which connected Deals Gap and Bryson City. The National Park Service, after gaining possession of Fontana's north shore tracts, reached an agreement with Swain County to replace the north shore road in the 1940s. By 1972, just of the road had been completed, with environmental concerns and funding issues stalling construction. In the 1970s, environmental concerns completely halted the road's progress, and locals nicknamed the unfinished road \\"The Road to Nowhere\\". After North Carolina's U.S. Senator Jesse Helms secured funding for the road in 2000, the park service conducted an environmental impact study (released in 2007) and concluded that the road's construction would cause \\"major, adverse, long-term impacts to topography, geology, and soils\\" in the area.North Shore Road Environmental Impact Statement, Section 4.2. 2007. Retrieved: 11 November 2010.North Shore Road Environmental Impact Statement, Section 4.3. 2007. Retrieved: 11 November 2010. Proponents of the road argued that the environmental concerns were exaggerated.Mark Barrett, Supporters Say Critics Exaggerate Threats to Nature. Citizentimes.com. Retrieved: 11 November 2010. In 2007, Swain County accepted a $52 million cash settlement from the park service and agreed to drop its demand for a new road along the North Shore. The final installment of $35.2 million was paid on June 29, 2018. However, under a 2010 agreement, the money was deposited with the state treasurer's office. Swain County can spend only the interest the money earns.

In zoology In case of a nomen dubium it may be impossible to determine whether a specimen belongs to that group or not. This may happen if the original type series (i. e. holotype, isotypes, syntypes, and paratypes) is lost or destroyed. The zoological and botanical codes allow for a new type specimen, or neotype, to be chosen in this case. A name may also be considered a nomen dubium if its name-bearing type is fragmentary or lacking important diagnostic features (this is often the case for species known only as fossils). To preserve stability of names, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature allows a new type specimen, or neotype, to be chosen for a nomen dubium in this case. > 75.5. Replacement of unidentifiable name-bearing type by a neotype. When an > author considers that the taxonomic identity of a nominal species-group > taxon cannot be determined from its existing name-bearing type (i.e. its > name is a nomen dubium), and stability or universality are threatened > thereby, the author may request the Commission to set aside under its > plenary power [Art. 81] the existing name-bearing type and designate a > neotype.International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (4th edition, 1999) For example, the crocodile-like archosaurian reptile Parasuchus hislopi Lydekker, 1885 was described based on a premaxillary rostrum (part of the snout), but this is no longer sufficient to distinguish Parasuchus from its close relatives. This made the name Parasuchus hislopi a nomen dubium. In 2001 a paleontologist proposed that a new type specimen, a complete skeleton, be designated.Case 3165, Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 58:1 , 30 March 2001. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature considered the case and agreed in 2003 to replace the original type specimen with the proposed neotype.Opinion 2045, Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 60:2 , 30 June 2003.  In bacteriology  In bacteriological nomenclature, nomina dubia may be placed on the list of rejected names by the Judicial Commission. The meaning of these names is uncertain. Other categories of names that may be treated in this way (rule 56a) are: *ambiguous names, nomina ambigua, have been used with more than one meaning *names causing confusion, nomina confusa, are based on a mixed culture *perplexing names, nomina perplexa, confusingly similar names *perilous names, nomina periculosa, names that may lead to accidents endangering life or health or with potential serious economic consequences  In other domains  In botanical nomenclature the phrase nomen dubium has no status, although it is informally used for names whose application has become confusing. In this regard however, its synonym nomen ambiguum is of more frequent use. In botany, such names may be proposed for rejection.

The main character, Gaston Bonaparte (a relative to the famous Napoleon Bonaparte) arrives at the Yokohama seaport to visit an old pen friend of his living in Tokyo. Gaston is a wise fool, an incredibly kind, innocent and naive, which causes different people to like him, help him, or take advantage of him. He never loses faith in humanity, however, and manages to make a deep impression on the most hardhearted persons. Beneath the light humor of the story are many clear references both to Endo's life story and his Christian beliefs. Plot summary One day Takamori, a young man living with his mother and dominant younger sister Tomoe, receives a letter from Singapore. After a while they manage to decipher the unusually poor Japanese, and figure out that Gaston Bonaparte, a man who used to be a pen friend of Takamori during his school days, will soon arrive in Japan. On the expected day, they find the poorly dressed Gaston (a striking contrast to his more famous relative, in the eyes of his Japanese hosts) in the cheapest class, deep down in the ship. Gaston immediately befriends a stray dog (who he initially calls 犬さん - Mr. Dog, but later renames Napoleon), who is to follow him for most of the story but he is eventually captured by the dog catcher and killed. After staying a few days at Takamori and Tomoe's home, Gaston decides to carry on his mysterious mission in Japan. He ends up checking into a Love hotel in Shibuya with his dog, attracting some strange looks from the owner. During the night Gaston manages to help a thieving prostitute escape (although mostly due to misunderstanding the situation), which gets him kicked out of the hotel in the middle of the night, but she gets him food and puts him in contact with an old fortune teller, who makes Gaston his assistant. Soon Gaston is kidnapped by a gangster planning to murder two old army officers for revenge. Gaston tries to talk the man, Endo, out of his violent plans. When this doesn't work, he simply steals the bullets from Endo's gun, thus making the victim able to run away. Endo knocks Gaston out and flees, but Gaston manages to track the next victim down, and outside his house he finds Endo once again. The former is not overly happy to see him, but figures that he could use some help with digging up some silver that the army officer stole during the war. In the mountain swamp where the treasure is supposed to be located, Endo and the army officer get into a fight. Gaston gets between them, saving the life of Endo, who is later found by a fisherman and rushed to a hospital. Gaston disappears and is never found again. Takamori and Tomoe later get hold of Gaston's diary. All that is written is a scrawl about his failure in passing the missionary exam. It is written that he still must go to Japan. It is clear by the novel's end that Gaston's visit has led the main characters to reassess their lives, Takamori begins to look at the less well off in Tokyo for the first time.

Dregger was born in Münster. After graduating from a school in Werl, he entered the German Wehrmacht in 1939. He was wounded four times and served until the end of the war, when he commanded a battalion on the Eastern Front at the rank of Captain. In 1946, he began studying law and government at the universities of Marburg and Tübingen, earning his doctorate in 1950.\\"Portrait Alfred Dregger: 'Freiheit statt Sozialismus\\"'\\" , Rheinische Post, 30 June 2002. Alfred Dregger, Chronik der Wende, RBB; accessed 24 August 2018.. Dregger served from 1956–70 as Oberbürgermeister or mayor of Fulda; when first elected, he was the youngest mayor in West Germany. He also served from 1962–72 as a member of the Landtag of Hesse. He was for a time leader of the CDU in that body, and, in 1967, became state party chairman, an office which he held until 1982. In 1969 he was also elected as a member of the national board of the party. From 1972–98 he was a representative in the German Bundestag; from 1982 to 1991 he was Chairman of the CDU/CSU group there. Dregger was known as a staunch conservative and was a prominent member of the so-called Stahlhelm-Fraktion, a National-Conservative wing of the CDU.Peter H.

Not much is known about his early life, though by the time he was 50 years old, he was a leading citizen of the town, having undertaken the roles of timber merchant and shipbuilder. His yard was on the south of the Salthouse Dock, Liverpool, and over the years he would build many coasting brigantines and sloops in alliance with William Marsh. By 1739 his reputation an accomplished ship builder got him the first of many commissions by the Royal Navy to build ships of the line. The first was the \\"Hastings\\", a ship of 44 guns and weighing 682 tons.Stewart-Brown, R. Liverpool Ships of the 18th Century p.117. Hodder & Stoughton. 1932. He would build another eight ships between 1740 and 1758 for the navy. His shipbuilding company saw several other partners over the years: by 1758 the firm was \\"Okill and Rigg\\", and in 1768 it became \\"Okill & Sutton\\". In addition to shipbuilding John Okill was also a Liverpool member of the Company of Merchants trading to Africa, formed in 1750. Though many of the other merchants traded in African slaves, Okill's was the only firm to take no part in the slave traffic, which instead \\"traded in wood and teeth (ivory)\\".Williams, Gomer The Liverpool Privateers and The Liverpool Slave Trade p.472. London, William Heinemann, 1897. In 1747 Okill was the donor of the lease for the site upon which the original St. Thomas's Church was built. In 1773 he started work on a manor home in Woolton called Lee Hall. He died later that same year, with work on the building completed by his inheriting nephew, James Okill. There were problems associated with the disposal of John Okill's estates, requiring an Act of Parliament in 1784, (24 Geo. [118] III, c. 1)The Chronological Tables of the Private and Personal Acts.Part 20 (1783-1794), Acts of the Parliaments of Great Britain , accessed 11 September 2007 to enable the trustees to dispose of certain of them. James and his inheritors, the Dutton family, helped to plan and layout what would become Gateacre. There was a monumental inscription to him at original St. Peter’s Church, Liverpool.Stewart-Brown, R. Liverpool Ships of the 18th Century p.117. Hodder & Stoughton. 1932. Lee Hall was torn down sometime after 1971.

Most often, it is a judgment in favor of a plaintiff when the defendant has not responded to a summons or has failed to appear before a court of law. The failure to take action is the default. The default judgment is the relief requested in the party's original petition. Default can be compared to a forfeit victory in sports. In a civil trial involving damages, a default judgment will enter the amount of damages pleaded in the original complaint. If proof of damages is required, the court may schedule another hearing on that issue. A party can have a default judgment vacated, or set aside, by filing a motion, after the judgment is entered, by showing of a proper excuse. Specific jurisdictions =England and Wales= How judgment arises In England and Wales, a Claimant starts a case by issuing a Claim Form. This either states a monetary figure on it, together with fixed costs and court fees; alternatively if the amount cannot be determined, it will be for an amount 'to be assessed'. A claimant may not wish to recover money at all, in which case the claim Form states this. The claim Form (together with other documents, known as particulars of claim and a response pack) are served on the defendant. If the defendant fails to reply within 14 days of service, the claimant can apply for a judgment in default, either by simply requesting the court's administrative staff enter judgment filing a request for judgment (which is sufficient for routine cases), or by making a formal application to the procedural judge. The judgment is known as Judgment in Default of Acknowledgment of Service. If the defendant acknowledged to the court that the papers were served within the 14-day period, then the defendant is given 28 days to take a further step. If the defendant fails to do so, again judgment can be entered as above; this time formally known as Judgment in Default of Defense. If money is claimed, the claimant can choose how their judgment will be phrased. Almost always there will be a request that the money claimed, the court fee, and interest at 8% on the money from when the claim Form was issued up until date of judgment, and if legally represented a fixed contribution to legal costs, be ordered to be paid immediately. However, the claimant could simply request the defendant be ordered to pay at a later date or in installments. If money is claimed but the amount is not fixed, a Disposal Hearing is listed to determine the amount of money. If any other remedy is claimed, the claimant would have had to apply to the procedural judge for the judgment in default, and therefore the judge will determine what happens next. Judgments in default are covered by Part 12 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. Effect of judgment The judgment is binding and failure to comply with it means that enforcement action could be taken. The defendant's name is also entered onto a register (although if they pay within a month it will be removed) which is open to everyone, and is particularly used to vet the credit-worthiness of people. In the case of Masters -v- Leaver [1999] EWCA Civ 2016 it was held that a judgment in default means just that - it is a judgment obtained due to default. It does not mean that the court has agreed with what was claimed, or favors one or other case. Therefore, if the issue arises again, the Defendant is not prevented from arguing the facts again. Varying default judgment If a defendant accepts the judgment, and the amount, but is unable to pay, the defendant may apply to vary the judgment. A process is gone through whereby the defendant states how soon they can afford to pay the debt (usually monthly installments) and the claimant can either accept this, or request another amount. The court's staff will suggest a figure and ultimately a district judge (N.B. In England and Wales a district judge is one of the lowest levels of judge) will make a decision. The decision is binding, even if it means the claimant is out of their money for a considerable amount of time, and even if interest cannot be charged on the outstanding sum (which it usually can not). Setting aside default judgment There are three grounds for canceling ('setting aside') the default judgment. * The documents were not served correctly. The defendant has to show that the documents were not served, which would explain why the claimant had ability to enter judgment. This has to be done by way of an \\"application on notice\\" (motion). Evidence has to be shown to the procedural judge. This used to be called setting aside an \\"irregular judgment\\". * There is some good reason why judgment in default should be set aside. This covers any situation but is commonly used when service was effected properly, but still did not come to the attention of the defendant (perhaps they were on a long vacation, or in hospital). Many jurisdictions also require the defendant to proffer a meritorious defense before vacating the default judgment. * The claimant entered judgment when they were not entitled so to do. For example, perhaps a defense was filed in time, but the claimant still attempts to enter judgment. The court staff usually check for things like this, but occasionally things slip through the net. It used to be the obligation of the claimant to apply to set aside their own judgment in these circumstances, but this obligation was dropped in 2005. In the last circumstance of the above, the defendant can get the judgment canceled as of right. Otherwise, the defendant needs to show what their defense will be, and if the court thinks that the defendant is effectively 'stalling for time' they will not get the judgment set aside. Practice In practice an application to set aside default Judgment is almost always granted. This fact is seized upon by so-called 'credit repair' companies. A person whose credit record is adversely affected by a registered judgment pays a credit repair company who advises them how to apply to have it set aside. This is usually of little effect: the judgment will be re-entered very quickly if there is no actual defense, and there are usually other records which affect a person's credit rating, not just the judgment. Pragmatic reasons why judgments are set aside are mainly because on balance, it is seen as better to give a person who may have a good defense extra time, and avoid a potentially devastating judgment, and thereby keep a claimant out of their money for a further two to four weeks, than give the claimant the benefit. However the court can, and often does, order conditions to be satisfied, such as a draft defense being filed first, money paid into court, or similar conditions. Setting aside a judgment in default is covered by Part 13 of the Civil Procedure Rules. =United States= In the United States the law relating to a default judgment depends upon the jurisdiction within which the civil action was filed. State courts, United States Federal Courts, Tribal Courts and many Administrative Agencies have their own laws and local procedural rules relating to the granting and setting aside of a default judgment. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules 55 and 60) are the basis for many procedures in default. Federal Rule 37(b)(iii) states that a plaintiff can be found in default and have his case dismissed if the plaintiff repeatedly fails to comply with things like court orders and discovery requests. Entry of default Typically, the plaintiff (or cross-complainant, cross-plaintiff, counter-claimant, counter-plaintiff, third-party plaintiff, etc.)E.g., Md. R. 2-613(a). must show that service of process was effected on the defendant (cross-defendant, counter-defendant, cross-defendant, third-party defendant, etc.). This is typically achieved by the filing of an affidavit of serviceE.g., F.R.Civ.P. 4(l). (also known as a proof of service),E.g., Calif. Code Civ. Proc. § 417.30. which gives enough information to allow the court to confirm that valid service has been accomplished.S. Baicker-McKee, W.M. Jansen, & J.B. Corr, Federal Civil Rules Handbook, Thomson/West, 2007, p. 220. Typically the affidavit states, under oath or penalty of perjury, that service was effected on a named defendant, briefly describes how it was effected, names the person who made service, and gives the place and date service was effected.E.g., D.C. Super. Ct. Civ. P. R. 4(l). Once the requisite time to respond to the complaint has passed, the defendant is \\"in default\\"; this may be automatic,E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 12(a); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(a). or it may require the court clerk to enter the default (which may, in turn, require that the plaintiff request entry of the default).E.g., Md. R. 2-613(b); Judicial Council of California, Form CIV-100. Some defaults do not take effect until a set period of time after the clerk acts.E.g., D.C. Super Ct. R. 55(a) (14 days, if the clerk dockets the default sua sponte). The clerk may have to give the defendant notice of his default, affording a chance to have the default vacated.E.g., Md. R. 2-613(c). The entry of a default typically prevents the defaulted defendant from litigating his case or presenting evidence, and may excuse the other parties from giving him notice of further proceedings.E.g., Va. Sup Ct. R. 3:19(a). Relief from default A defaulted defendant may move the court from relief from his default,E.g., Md. R. 2-613(d); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(b). but usually must do so promptlyE.g., Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473(b), 473.5; Md. R. 2-613(d). and must provide \\"good cause\\"F.R.Civ.P. 55(c). for his failure to answer the complaint in time.E.g., Calif. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473(b). Often, part of the procedure for relief from default involves the defendant filing an answer to the complaint.E.g., D.C. Super Ct. Civ. Proc. R. 55(c). The defendant relieved from default may also be required to pay any extra costs and fees incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the delay in the defendant's filing his answer.E.g., Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(b). Default judgment Often, a certain additional time is required before a default judgment is permissible, and there may need to be additional notice to the defendant. Some states do not allow a default judgment to be entered against some defendants while other defendants are actively litigating the same case;E.g., Virginia. this is an application of the \\"one final judgment\\" rule. Others will allow \\"several judgment\\" (judgment with respect to some defendants at one time, and with respect to others at another time), at least under some circumstances.E.g., Calif. Code Civ. Proc. § 579. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act significantly restricts default judgments against members of the military services.Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act), 50 USC App. § 521. The law requires that before a default judgment may be entered, the plaintiff must make a certification as to the military service status of the defendant whose default is sought.50 USC App. § 521(b)(1) This certification may be made in the complaint, in a document filed with the proof of service, or later. Depending on the circumstances, other requirements may also apply.50 USC App. § 521(b). Some jurisdictions allow a clerk of court to enter default judgment in certain simple cases.E.g., F.R.Civ.P.55(b)(1); Calif. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 585(a), 1169. These typically involve no exercise of judgment or discretion.See, e.g., R.I. Weil & I.A. Brown, Jr., California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, The Rutter Group, ¶ 5:121 ff. Otherwise, a default judgment must be issued by a judge, who may require the plaintiff to present proof of his claims.E.g., Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(c). Relief from default judgment A defendant who has had a default judgment entered against him may move for an order vacating the judgment.E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 55(c), 60(b); Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:19(d). Such a defendant must show \\"good cause\\" for his not having responded to the complaint. However, \\"good cause\\" is rather easy to meet, compared to other instances where \\"good cause\\" might be required. For example, mere \\"excusable neglect\\" is, at least at the federal level, a sufficient reason to vacate default judgments.E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). There are often time limits and other requirements. Sewer service, where a default judgement is obtained by fraud by not properly notifying the defendant that they are being sued, may result in a motion to vacate the default judgement, a civil lawsuit against a dishonest plaintiff or process server, or criminal charges for swearing a false affidavit.https://web.archive.org/web/20101117070043/http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2009/apr/apr14a_09.html A court entertaining a motion to vacate a default judgment often considers the reasons presented the defendant's failure to respond (such as \\"excusable neglect\\" and the prejudice that might be suffered by the other party).E.g., F.R.Civ.P. 60(b); Jones v. Hunt, 298 A.2d 220 (D.C. 1972). The court must weigh these factors in light of two competing considerations: the general preference for cases to be decided \\"on the merits\\", and the important need for \\"finality in litigation.\\"E.g., Dunn v. Profitt, 408 A.2d 991 (D.C. 1979).

He conducted deadly experiments on humans pertaining to high altitude, freezing and blood coagulation under the patronage of SS leader Heinrich Himmler, to whom his wife Karoline \\"Nini\\" Diehl had direct connections. When police investigations uncovered that the couple had defrauded the public with their supernatural fertility by 'hiring' and kidnapping babies, she and Rascher were arrested in April 1944. He was accused of financial irregularities, murder of his former lab assistant, and scientific fraud, and brought to Buchenwald and Dachau before being executed. After his death, the Nuremberg Trials judged his experiments as inhumane and criminal. Early life  Sigmund Rascher was born the third child of Hanns-August Rascher (1880–1952) a physician and avid follower of Rudolf Steiner. Therefore, Rascher attended the first Waldorf School, a school based on Steiner's anthroposophist approach to education. He came under the influence of Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, who believed in the influence of cosmic rhythms on life processes.Jeremy Garwood Book Review Siegfried Bär: The Fall of the House of Rascher. Lab Times, 5 February 2015. He completed his secondary education, the German Abitur in Konstanz in 1930 or 1931—he used both dates. Education In 1933, he began to study medicine in Munich, where he also joined the NSDAP. The exact day of his joining is uncertain: Rascher insisted that it was on 1 March, whereas documents show 1 May. This is relevant in that the first date is 4 days before the Nazi victory in the German national election, March 1933, whereas the second date is after Hitler had consolidated power on 23 March with his Enabling Act. After his medical internship, Rascher worked with his now divorced father in Basel, Switzerland, and continued his medical studies there, joining the Swiss Voluntary Work Forces. In 1934, he returned to Munich to finish his studies, and received his doctorate in 1936. In May 1936, Rascher joined the SA. From 1936 to 1938 Rascher worked on cancer diagnostics, supported by a DFG stipend under Prof. Trumpp in Munich. Until 1939 he was an assistant physician at Munich's hospital Schwabinger Krankenhaus. In 1939, Rascher transferred to the SS with the rank of Private. Career with the SS In 1939 Rascher denounced his father, and was conscripted into the Luftwaffe. A relationship with and eventual marriage to former singer Karoline \\"Nini\\" Diehl gained him direct access to Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Rascher's connection with Himmler gave him immense influence, even over his superiors. Though it is unclear as to the precise nature of Diehl's connection to Himmler, she frequently corresponded with him and interceded with him on her husband's behalf; it is suggested that Diehl may have been a former lover of Himmler's. A week after first meeting Himmler, Rascher presented a paper, \\"Report on the Development and Solution to Some of the Reichsfuehrer's Assigned Tasks During a Discussion Held on April 24, 1939\\". Rascher became involved in testing a plant extract as a cancer treatment. Kurt Blome, deputy of the Reich Health Leader and Plenipotentiary for Cancer Research in the Reich Research Council, favoured testing the extract on rodents but Rascher insisted on using human test subjects. Himmler took Rascher's side and a Human Cancer Testing Station was established at Dachau. Blome worked on the project. =High altitude experiments= Rascher suggested in early 1941, while a captain in the Luftwaffe's Medical Service, that high-altitude/low-pressure experiments be carried out on human beings. While taking a course in aviation medicine at Munich, he wrote Himmler a letter in which he said that his course included research into high-altitude flight and it was regretted that no tests with humans had been possible as such experiments were highly dangerous and nobody volunteered for them. Rascher asked Himmler to place human subjects at his disposal, stating quite frankly that the experiments might prove fatal, but that previous tests made with monkeys had been unsatisfactory. The letter was answered by Rudolf Brandt, Himmler's adjutant, who informed Rascher that prisoners would be made available.Pringle, Heather, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, Hyperion, 2006. Rascher subsequently wrote back to Brandt, asking for permission to carry out his experiments at Dachau, and plans for the experiments were developed at a conference in early 1942 attended by Rascher and members of the Luftwaffe Medical Service. The experiments were carried out in the spring and summer of the same year, using a portable pressure chamber supplied by the Luftwaffe. The victims were locked in the chamber, the interior pressure of which was then lowered to a level corresponding to very high altitudes. The pressure could be very quickly altered, allowing Rascher to simulate the conditions which would be experienced by a pilot freefalling from altitude without oxygen. After viewing a report of one of the fatal experiments, Himmler remarked that if a subject should survive such treatment, he should be \\"pardoned\\" to life imprisonment. Rascher replied to Himmler that the victims had to date been merely Poles and Russians, and that he believed they should be given no amnesty of any sort. =Freezing experiments= Mugshot of Wolfram Sievers, taken by American authorities after his arrest Rascher also conducted so-called \\"freezing experiments\\" on behalf of the Luftwaffe on 300 test subjects without their consent. American investigators later concluded that Rascher had been merely a convenient front for Luftwaffe chief surgeon Erich Hippke, who had been the true source of the ideas for Rascher's experiments.Hippkes letter to Wolff of 6 March 1943. In Facsimile at Nuremberg Trials Project. (Nürnberger Document NO-262). The experiments were conducted at Dachau after the high-altitude experiments had concluded. The purpose was to determine the best way of warming German pilots who had been forced down in the North Sea and suffered hypothermia. Rascher's victims were forced to remain outdoors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for three hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victims was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in hot water; at least one witness, an assistant to some of these procedures, later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming. Himmler attended some of the experiments, and told Rascher he should go to the North Sea region and find out how ordinary people there warmed victims of extreme cold. Himmler reportedly said he thought \\"that a fisherwoman could well take her half-frozen husband into her bed and revive him in that manner\\" and added that everyone believed \\"animal warmth\\" had a different effect than artificial warmth. Four Romani women were sent from Ravensbrück concentration camp and warming was attempted by placing the hypothermic victim between two naked women.Annas, p. 74.Letter from Rascher to Himmler, 17 Feb 1943 from Trials of War Criminals before the Nurenberg Military Tribunals, Vol. 1, Case 1: The Medical Case (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1949-1950), pp. 249–251. In October 1942, results of the experiments were presented at a medical conference in Nuremberg in two presentations named \\"Prevention and Treatment of Freezing\\", and \\"Warming Up After Freezing to the Danger Point\\".Annas, p. 76. Rascher, who had by now been transferred to the Waffen-SS, was eager to obtain the academic credentials necessary for a high-level university position. A habilitation which was to be based on his research failed, however, at Munich, Marburg, and Frankfurt, due to the formal requirement that results be made available for public scrutiny.Kater, pp. 125–126. Similar experiments were conducted from July to September 1944, as the Ahnenerbe provided space and materials to doctors at Dachau to undertake \\"seawater experiments\\", chiefly through Wolfram Sievers. Sievers is known to have visited Dachau on 20 July 1944, to speak with Kurt Plötner and the non- Ahnenerbe Wilhelm Beiglboeck, who ultimately carried out the experiments. While at Dachau, Rascher developed the standard cyanide capsules, which could be easily bitten through, either deliberately or accidentally. = Blood coagulation experiments = Rascher experimented with the effects of Polygal, a substance made from beet and apple pectin, which aided blood clotting. He predicted that the preventive use of Polygal tablets would reduce bleeding from gunshot wounds sustained during combat or during surgery. Subjects were given a Polygal tablet, and shot through the neck or chest, or their limbs amputated without anaesthesia. Rascher published an article on his experience of using Polygal, without detailing the nature of the human trials and also set up a company to manufacture the substance, staffed by prisoners.Michalczyk, p. 96. Personal life and execution Attempting to please Himmler through demonstrating that population growth could be accelerated by extending female childbearing age, Rascher publicized the fact that his wife Karoline had given birth to three children even after reaching 48 years of age, and Himmler used a photograph of Rascher's family as propaganda material. However, during her fourth \\"pregnancy,\\" Mrs. Rascher was arrested while attempting to kidnap a baby. An investigation later revealed that her other three children had been either purchased or kidnapped. Himmler felt betrayed, and Rascher was arrested in April 1944. In addition to acting as an accessory in the kidnappings of the three infants, Rascher was also accused of financial irregularities, the murder of his former lab assistant, and scientific fraud. Both Rascher and his wife were hastily condemned without trial to the concentration camps.Michalczyk, p. 97. Rascher was imprisoned at Buchenwald following his arrest in 1944, until the camp's evacuation in April 1945. He and other prisoners were then taken to Dachau where Rascher was executed by firing squad on 26 April 1945, three days before the camp was liberated by American troops.Doctors From Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans by Vivien Spitz, p. 225. In another first hand account a fellow SS officer witnessed Rascher's execution by SS-Hauptscharführer on Himmler's direct order by shooting him through the cell observation and food delivery door, then kicking his body with the words 'You pig, now you've got the punishment you deserve'.SS Geiseln in Der Alpenfestung, Hans-Guenter Ricardi, Bolzano: Raetia, 2015, Loc 4644 After his death, the Nuremberg Trials judged his experiments as inhumane and criminal..

During May 1 and May 2, 2011, he served as the studio anchor for Fox News coverage of the death of Osama bin Laden. He received an Emmy for news writing for the NBC program Dateline.  Controversy  Scott drew criticism in April 2017 after stating on Fox & Friends, \\"Just an aside to the Muslim community, if you don't want to be portrayed in a negative light, maybe don't burn people alive and set off bombs and things like that.\\" Critics charged this statement as a hasty generalization, a logical fallacy in which specifics are incorrectly generalized to a greater population. In 2009, Scott also drew criticism from Howard Kurtz, then at CNN, for plagiarizing a Republican party press release regarding the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Scott's content repeated the same typographical error, and did not attribute or acknowledge its source. Scott acknowledged that he had re-used the press release and apologized for not correcting the error, but did not apologize for plagiarizing the content.

Accessed November 15, 2010. and a unique element for first-degree or aggravated murder in a few. Insofar as the term is still in use, it has a technical meaning that has changed substantially over time. Etymology Malice aforethought is a translation of the Law French term malice prépensée.Peter M. Tiersma, A History Of The Languages Of Law, (2012), (last visited Feb 2, 2018). Legal history Malice aforethought was not an element of murder in early medieval English law cases. Both self-defence killings and death by misadventure were treated as murder by juries. Although pardons for self-defence became common after the Statute of Gloucester was passed in 1278, the jury in a 14th century case still found that a self-defence killing was felonious. In the 12th century, any death by misadventure without a \\"presentment of Englishry\\" was sufficient for a jury finding of murder, even in cases where there was no suspect and the victim's identity is unknown. The murder fine was levied in these cases under the Laws of Henry until 1267, when the fine for death by misadventure was abolished by the Statute of Marlborough during the baronial reform movement.Leges Henrici 91; 52 Hen. III, c.25 The primary meaning of murdurum continued to be murder fine until the fine was abolished by the Engleschrie Act of 1340.14 Edw. III St. 1 c. 4 The first statutory mention of malice aforethought dates to the reign of Richard II in 1389.13 Rich. II St. 2 c. 1 In 1390 Parliament defined murder as \\"death of a man slain by await, assault, or mallice prepensed\\". Henceforth, juries were instructed to consider whether a felony had been committed with malice aforethought. A 1403 jury instruction recorded in a 16th-century manuscript written by Edward Stillingfleet reads: \\"Also you will inquire about all sorts of homicides both of those who lie in wait through malice aforethought [par malice devant pourpense] in the peace of homes and other places [and who] murder people and of those who slay men through a hot-blooded mêlée [chaude melle]\\".Harl. MS 773; Jeremy Horder, Provocation and Responsibility (1992), p.10 Some scholars have identified concepts from Anglo-Saxon law as the origin for malice aforethought, but the connection is disputed. The Anglo Saxon legal concept of forsteal included lying in wait and ambush, but it remains unclear whether or not premeditation or intent were requirements for murder during this early period. It has been argued that forstealII Cnut, 12-15; Leges Henrici. 80 secs. 2,4 became agwait purpenseLeges Wilhelmi, I. 2 in medieval English law, which was also called agwait premeditatus in Latin. In 1552 malice aforethought is applied as a requirement for murder in Thomas Buckler's Case. Malice aforethought emerges as an ill-defined concept from the writings of Blackstone, Joseph Chitty and their predecessors, Matthew Hale and Edward Coke. =Distinguished from manslaughter= After the Norman conquest, common law courts began to distinguish murders from homicides that occur during sudden brawls. Over centuries, this distinction evolved into an early form of the doctrine of provocation that distinguishes murder from voluntary manslaughter. By the time the Statute of Stabbing was passed in 1604, judges had started to consider whether provocation was sufficient in \\"heat of the blood\\" cases. During the 17th century, this was more clearly articulated in subsequent cases and gradually developed into the common law categorical test for provocation. The Statute of Stabbing had removed the benefit of clergy for cases where there was a killing without provocation. =Early American law= Malice aforethought was the mens rea element of murder in 19th-century America,Thomas Welburn Hughes, A treatise on criminal law and procedure (1919) § 110, p. 72. Found at Internet Archive. Accessed November 15, 2010.See The Free Legal Dictionary, citing, John Bouvier A Law Dictionary, Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States (1856), citing Fost. 424; Yelv. 205; 1 Chit.

As of 1891, Texas courts were overwhelmed with discussing whether \\"malice\\" needs to be expressed or implied in the judge's jury instructions.See Ainsworth v. State, 16 S.W. 652 (Tex. 1891), Washington v. State, 16 S.W. 653 (Tex. 1891), Mendez v. State, 16 S.W. 766, 767 (Tex. 1891), and Martinez v. State, 16 S.W. 767, 768 (Tex. 1891), found at Google Books. Accessed November 15, 2010. However, the 1970s revision of the Texas Penal Code states that a murder must be committed \\"intentionally or knowingly\\" in Texas. Modern law =England= In English law, the mens rea requirement of murder is either an intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. In R v Moloney [1985],. Lord Bridge held that intent is defined in the mens rea requirement of murder 'means intent' so the jury should simply use the term intent legally as they would in normal parlance. Furthermore, he held that for the defendant to have the mens rea of murder, there must be something more than mere foresight or knowledge that death or serious injury is a \\"natural\\" consequence of the current activities: there must be clear evidence of an intention. This element of intention is fulfilled when the defendant's motive or purpose was to cause death or serious bodily harm (also known as 'direct intent') but also when the defendant's motive or purpose was not to cause death or grievous bodily harm but (as held by Lord Steyn in R v Woollin) death or serious bodily harm was a 'virtual certainty' of the defendant's act, and the defendant appreciated that to be so (also known as 'oblique intent.') =United States= In most common law jurisdictions, the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, and in the various U.S. state statutes, which have codified homicide definitions, the term has been abandoned or substantially revised. The four states of mind that are now recognized as constituting \\"malice aforethought\\" in murder prosecutions are as follows:Wise, Edward. \\"Criminal Law\\" in Introduction to the Law of the United States (Clark and Ansay, eds.), 154 (2002). #intent to kill #intent to inflict serious bodily injury #extremely reckless disregard for the value of human life #felony murder rule Since there are 4 different states of mind of malice aforethought, it can be hard to find the differences. It is easiest to break these categories up by premeditation, or express malice and reckless endangerment, or implied malice. Intent to kill or to inflict serious bodily injury would be considered express. This does not mean that the accused made a plan far in advance, but it could even be in the moment of the crime. If the person did the action knowing it would hurt or kill the other person, there was express malice involved, which is a form of malice aforethought. As stated above, malice aforethought does not require that the person accused premeditated to hurt a person, but that they knew their actions could lead to someone's harm. This is implied malice, which requires that a person knowingly did an act that they knew was dangerous, and acted without concern for other people's safety. Intention can also be found where the perpetrator acts with gross recklessness showing lack of care for human life, commonly referred to as \\"depraved-heart murder\\", or during the commission of or while in flight from a felony or attempted felony (termed felony murder). Notably, the principle of transferred intent causes an accused who intended to kill one person but inadvertently killed another instead to remain guilty of murder. The intent to kill the first person suffices. = Australia = Malice aforethought is no longer regarded as a necessary mens rea element to prove a murder conviction. The term is a catch-all phrase that encompasses all the states of mind that are sufficient mens rea for murder.. Most Australian jurisdictions require some degree of actual awareness of the resulting consequences of the accused's own actions to justify a murder conviction. The High Court of Australia affirmed that there is a spectrum of mens rea ranging from intention to kill to reckless indifference that would be relevant in securing a murder conviction.. However, the High Court ruled that it was not necessary to prove malice aforethought in a manslaughter conviction.. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria distinguished between the two classes of manslaughter. They were manslaughter by reckless indifference and manslaughter by criminal negligence in R v Nydam. in which malice aforethought was definitively ruled out as an element in a charge of manslaughter by criminal negligence.

The engineer who constructed the bridge was named Eugène Freyssinet, and the president of the committee managing the project was Albert Louppe, an explosives engineer who pursued a parallel career in politics, becoming the Senator for Finistère in 1921. Louppe died in 1927, one year after work on constructing the bridge finally began.

It translates literally as \\"have life\\" or \\"be healthy\\", and is used as an informal greeting equivalent to \\"hi\\" or \\"hello\\", or an expression of thanks similar to \\"cheers\\". Meaning Kia ora can be used to wish somebody life and health—the word ora used as a noun means \\"life, health and vitality\\". It might also be used as a salutation, a farewell or an expression of thanks. It also signifies agreement with a speaker at a meeting, being as it is from a culture that prizes oratory. It is widely used alongside other more formal Māori greetings. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage website NZ History lists it as one of 100 Māori words every New Zealander should know, and lists the following definition: \\"Hi!, G'day! (general informal greeting)\\". Kia ora can follow a similar pattern to address different specific numbers of people. By itself, it can be used to address any number of people, but by adding koe (i.e., kia ora koe); kōrua; and koutou one can specify a greeting to, respectively, a single; two; or three or more people. Similarly, by following with tātou, one addresses all the people present, including the speaker themselves. =Commercial use= New Zealand's national airline, Air New Zealand, uses Kia Ora as the name for its inflight magazine. Water Safety New Zealand, a water-safety advocacy organisation, has a specific Māori water safety programme, Kia Maanu Kia Ora, which makes use of the literal meaning of kia ora, as their message translates as stay afloat; stay alive. =Controversy= In 1984, at a time when the use of Māori phrases was uncommon in New Zealand, an Auckland telephone operator, Naida Glavish, was instructed to stop using kia ora when greeting callers after the post office had received a complaint. She refused to do so and was consequently stood down, with the whole affair attracting much public interest. The Postmaster-General, Rob Talbot, convinced the Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, to overturn that prohibition.  In other languages  Kia ora has a similar meaning to the word kia orana, found in many related Polynesian languages such as Cook Islands Māori.

Early years Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Johnson started out as a bank teller, and later studied acting at the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago. Radio Johnson began his career in Chicago, some of his earliest work including a regular role on Edgar A. Guest's dramatic serial Welcome Valley (1932–1937) as Bill Sutter, and was featured on The National Farm and Home Hour in dramatic sketches as the Forest Ranger (a role also played by Don Ameche). =Chicago to New York= While in Chicago, Johnson began working with writer/director Arch Oboler, with roles on his Lights Out series. When both Oboler and Johnson relocated to New York City, the actor was featured in many episodes of Arch Oboler's Plays, notably as the title role in \\"The Ugliest Man in the World\\" (repeated five times) and as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in \\"This Lonely Heart\\" both from 1939. =Inner Sanctum= While in New York, Johnson landed his most famous role when Himan Brown hired him for Inner Sanctum. From the first broadcast in 1941, Johnson was heard as the series host/narrator, introducing himself as \\"Your host, Raymond.\\" The \\"Raymond\\" character became known for his chilling introductions and morbid puns, and his typical closing, an elongated and ironic \\"Pleasant dreaaaams, hmmmmmmm?\\" Johnson departed the series in 1945, when he joined the Army; although replaced for the remainder of the run by Paul McGrath as host, Johnson took the \\"Raymond\\" name with him. Johnson later hosted the radio version of the science fiction series Tales of Tomorrow. =Soap operas= In both New York and Chicago, he was a staple on many soap operas, playing romantic leads on Big Sister (as Dr. Bernard), on the radio version of The Guiding Light (as enigmatic stranger Ellis Smith), 1943's Brave Tomorrow (as Hal Lambert), Kate Hopkins, Angel of Mercy (as Robert Atwood) and Valiant Lady (as Paul Morrison).Buxton, Frank; Owen, Bill (1972).

Broadway On stage, Johnson starred as Thomas Jefferson in Sidney Kingsley's Broadway play The Patriots, in 1943. Film Johnson's few on-camera appearances included the role of Alexander Graham Bell in the 1947 film Mr. Bell. Later years Stricken with multiple sclerosis from his forties onward, limiting his activities in later years, Johnson was still a frequent presence at old time radio conventions, performing in recreations and reprising \\"Raymond\\", often from a portable bed or wheelchair.

Born as Matěj Valentin Kramerius to the Roman Catholic family of burghers of Klatovy town, southwestern Bohemia, he went to the Jesuit high school there and then studied philosophy and law at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague (1778–1780). During his studies he earned money by cataloguing the library of a nobleman, which gave him access to old Czech books. From 1786 he worked as a journalist in the only and oldest Czech language weekly Pražské poštovské noviny but in 1789 he started a newspaper of his own (renamed to Krameriusovy c. k. vlastenecké noviny\\"Kramerius' Imperial- Royal Patriotic Newspapers\\" in English in 1791), which he published regularly until his death.

The rank typically exists in militaries that do not maintain a rank of brigadier general or brigadier. In Nazi Germany, a rank equivalent to senior colonel, Oberführer, was used by both the SA and SS. In the branches of the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS) the rank of Oberführer was widely used. The rank did not exist in the army (Heer), although the Kriegsmarine (navy) maintained the equivalent rank of Kommodore. After World War II, armies in Asia, especially in the Communist sphere began establishing senior colonel ranks of their own. Today, the rank of senior colonel may be found in the militaries of China (Daxiao ( 大校)), North Korea (Taejwa (대좌)) and Vietnam ̣̣(Đại tá). Most western militaries tend to equate a senior colonel as a \\"brigadier general in disguise\\"; however, this is not necessarily so. Nations which maintain senior colonel ranks may also have five general ranks (most such nations also having the rank of colonel general). A senior colonel is also not befitted honors of a general or flag officer. It is simply seen as the highest field officer rank before the general grades. In this sense, the rank may be seen as comparable to the rank of brigadier in the British and some other Commonwealth armies, similarly a senior field rank. A similar title to senior colonel is that of senior captain, also used in most Communist countries. However, it may also be found in some western militaries as a staff rank appointed to a regular captain. The term senior colonel is also used informally and unofficially in the U.S. military for colonels who have either been selected for promotion to brigadier general but not actually promoted yet, or for veteran colonels who are particularly experienced and influential. The Argentine Army makes a similar use of the term, though in this case it is an official distinction (Coronel Mayor) with its own rank insignia (a single red-trimmed golden sun instead of the three golden suns of a regular colonel). In the Portuguese Army, a colonel selected but still waiting for promotion to a general officer rank is officially designated coronel tirocinado (literally meaning \\"practiced colonel\\" in Portuguese), having a proper rank insignia (the rank stripes of colonel added with a general rank silver star). The naval equivalent for a senior colonel is the non-flag commodore or fleet captain, although it is sometimes referred to as a senior captain.

He was appointed by King Otto I to succeed his brother, Siegfried, as count and margrave in the district fronting the Wends on the lower Saale in 937. His appointment frustrated Thankmar, the king's half-brother and Siegfried's cousin, and together with Eberhard of Franconia and Wichmann the Elder, he revolted against the king (938).Reuter, 152. Thankmar was dead within a year and his accomplices came to terms with Otto. Gero was kept in his march. During the insurrection of his opponents, Gero had been prosecuting a losing war against the Slavs in 937-938\\\\. The losses his troops sustained could not be made up for by the produce of the land nor by tribute, since the Slavs refused to pay.

Gero in revenge invited thirty Slav chieftains to a banquet whereat he killed all but one, who managed to escape by accident.Howorth, 218. In response, the Stodorani revolted against German overlordship and chased the Germans across the Elbe, but Gero was able to reverse this before Otto's arrival in Magdeburg later in the year. He subsequently bribed Tugumir, a baptised Slav prince, to betray his countryman and make his people subject to Germany. Soon after, the Obodrites and the Wilzes made submission. In 954, while Gero was away, the Ukrani (or Ucri) revolted, but Gero returned with Conrad the Red and pacified them. In 955, some Saxon counts rebelled and were banished by Duke Herman. They found refuge in Swetlastrana, a Slav town, location unknown (maybe current Berlin- Lichtenberg), where the Obodrite chiefs Nakon and Stoinegin (or Stojgnev) resided. There Herman besieged them until an agreement was reached, but an ensuing skirmish spoiled the peace. The Obodrites, Wilzes, Chrepienyani, Redarii, and Dolenzi then banded together to oppose the coming army of Gero, the king, and Liudolf, Duke of Swabia. After negotiations failed because the Germans harsh terms, the Slavs were defeated in battle on the Drosa.Howorth, 219. Gero participated in general Saxon campaigns against the Slavs in 957, 959, and 960, as well as campaigning against the Wends and forcing Mieszko I of the Polans to pay tribute, grant land lien, and recognise German sovereignty during Otto's absence in Italy (962-963).Reuter, 164.

As an act of devotion, Gero made a pilgrimage to Rome in 959 after Siegfried's death.Leyser, \\"Henry I,\\" 147. In Siegfried's name, in 960, he also founded a Romanesque collegiate church, St Cyriakus, and the abbey of Gernrode, in a forest named after him, Geronisrode (Gernrode), and left a large part of his great wealth to it on his death.Reuter, 241. The church and abbey were dedicated to St. Cyriacus, and the abbey was a convent, housing nuns and canonesses.Bernhardt, 176 and n243. Gero's second son, Gero II, had already died at that point. The name of Gero's wife has to be hypothesised from libri memoriales: it was either Judith (Iudita) or Thietsuuind (Thietswind). Death and division of territory The marca Geronis (hatched) corresponds to the southern 3/4 of the Saxon marches: Nordmark, Lausitz, Merseburg, Meissen, and Zeitz. At his death, Gero's march extended as far as the Neisse river. He was not popular with the Saxon nobility of his day, because he had a strong sense of moral rectitude and was of low birth.Thompson, 487. Nonetheless, he became celebrated in the Nibelungenlied as the marcgrâve Gêre, though it has been disputed whether he was ever officially accorded that title.Dvornik, 138. Thompson, 486. He is referred to as ducis et marchionis nostri by Otto I in a charter dated 9 May 946, though Widukind only ever refers to him as comes or praeses. Gero's tomb can still be see in Gernrode today. A decorative painting was added to it c. 1350. It depicts Gero standing over a vanquished Wend.Jakubowska, 64 n16. After his death, the huge territory he had conquered was divided by the Emperor Otto into several different marches: the Northern March (under Dietrich of Haldensleben), the Eastern March (under Odo I), the March of Meissen (under Wigbert), the March of Merseburg (under Günther) and the March of Zeitz (under Wigger I). Later the Northern March was subdivided into the marches of Landsberg, Lusatia, and Brandenburg. The division of Gero's \\"super- march\\" probably had something to do with its immense size and the political consideration of trying to please many without making enemies.Reuter, 160. The subdivisions into which it was divided, however, were natural. As early as 963, Lusatia -- and even upper and lower Lusatia -- and the Ostmark were distinguishable as governable provinces within Gero's march.

Career Hennessey was ranked among the 10 best American players three times, his highest ranking being No. 4 in 1928. In both 1927 and 1928 he was the World No. 8 ranked player by A Wallis Myers. In 1925 he and Ray Casey reached the finals of the Wimbledon doubles. In an era in which tournament doubles matches were considered almost as important as singles, they lost one of the most famous matches in the early history of tennis, being beaten 4–6, 9–11, 6–4, 6–1, 3–6 by one of the great French teams of Jean Borotra and René Lacoste. Hennessey and George Lott won the 1928 doubles title at the U.S. Nationals, the same year that Hennessey lost two singles matches in the final Challenge Round of the Davis Cup against France. Hennessey reached the quarterfinals of the 1927 U.S. National championship and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in both 1925 and 1928. A July 14, 1924 Time Magazine article called him The Indianapolis Cyclone. He also won the 1920 singles title at the Tri-State Tennis Tournament, now known as the Cincinnati Masters. He reached the singles final there in 1919 and was the doubles champion there in 1917 (with Albrecht Kipp) and 1920 (with Fritz Bastian). He won the doubles title at the Western Tennis Championships in 1926, and reached the singles final of the Western in 1921. In 1927 at the Western Championships, he reached the finals in singles (defeating future International Tennis Hall of Fame enshrinee Wilmer Allison in the semifinals) and in doubles (with partner Emmett Paré). Also in 1927, he was runner-up at the Illinois State championship, losing in a five-set final to Bill Tilden. In 1984 Hennessey was one of the first four inductees into the USTA/Midwest Section Hall of Fame. There is an annual John F. Hennessey Open tournament in Indianapolis for junior players.

Nawijn was born in Kampen. The son of a burgemeester (mayor), he is a descendant of Firmin Navin, a French Huguenot who had fled to Holland in 1696 to escape persecution. After graduating Emelwerda College in Emmeloord he studied law at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Following a long career working for the Dutch Ministry of Justice he was elected in 2002 as a member of the Christen-Democratisch Appèl for the municipal council of Zoetermeer. Nawijn was an early supporter of the openly gay, populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and in 2002, when Fortuyn founded the Pim Fortuyn List, Nawijn earned a place on the list. Despite the assassination of Fortuyn by an animal rights activist, which happened days before the election, the LPF emerged with a successful result, thus bringing Nawijn into the Dutch House of Representatives. He was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration in the first Balkenende cabinet. Due to the instability of the LPF following Fortuyn's assassination, the first Balkenende cabinet lasted briefly, leading to early elections in 2003. Due to Nawijn's controversial conservative positions such as his support of the death penalty, which horrified many people in the Netherlands, he was placed at the bottom of the LPF's electoral list. This should have made it almost impossible for Nawijn to be reelected, however, the same statements which made him so unpopular to the political establishment won him a following among voters. On election day Nawijn received enough individual votes to once again enter the House of Representatives. Despite still being a member of the LPF, Nawijn often was at odds with the party. In January 2005, he left the fragmented LPF with the goal of founding his own political party which conceptually would lean closer towards the ideas of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. Together with one of the leaders of Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter, in June 2005 he announced the founding of a think tank during a controversial meeting in the former house of murdered politician Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn's brother, called this action provocative, and \\"I had expected otherwise from Nawijn.\\" The influential Dutch magazine Elsevier writes: \\"According to (the LPF member of parliament) Varela, it was widely known that Pim Fortuyn wanted nothing to do with Dewinter, whose party Vlaams Blok (resurrected as Vlaams Belang) had the previous year been forbidden due to racism.\\" In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, Nawijn managed, with his own new party, to gather 5 out of 39 seats in his hometown Zoetermeer. Later that year he entered the 2006 Dutch election with a new party, the Partij voor Nederland (Party for the Netherlands), but obtained no seats. During his campaign, Nawijn voiced his support for accepting CIA black sites into the Netherlands in an interview in October 2006 in the Dutch newspaper Spits. In early 2007, Nawijn participated in the Dutch version of So You Wanna Be a Popstar?, broadcast by the Dutch commercial TV channel SBS6, granting him fulfilment of one of his dreams. He stated that \\"Now that I have left national politics, I can do such things. An additional advantage is that it will keep me a bit 'in the picture'\\". As a result of his performances at the talent contest, which were met with public ridicule, Nawijn signed up for a five-year contract as a singer. His first single came out in May 2007, Hey Jumpen, in the jumpstyle genre, and reached #45 in the Dutch Single Top 100 charts. In February 2008 he returned to his original career in law.

The goal of the ECCP is to identify, develop and implement all the necessary elements of an EU strategy to implement the Kyoto Protocol. All EU countries' ratifications of the Kyoto Protocol were deposited simultaneously on 31 May 2002. The ECCP involved all the relevant stakeholders working together, including representatives from Commission's different departments, the member states, industry and environmental groups. The European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is perhaps the most significant contribution of the ECCP, and the EU ETS is the largest greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. In 1996 the EU adopted a target of a maximum 2 °C rise in global mean temperature, compared to pre- industrial levels. Since then, European Leaders have reaffirmed this goal several times.R.S.J. Tol (2007), Europe's long-term climate target: A critical evaluation, Energy Policy, 35 (1), 424–432Oliver Geden (2013), Modifying the 2°C Target. Climate Policy Objectives in the Contested Terrain of Scientific Policy Advice, Political Preferences, and Rising Emissions, SWP Research Paper 5 Due to only minor efforts in global Climate change mitigation it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target. The EU might then be forced to accept a less ambitious target or to change its climate policy paradigm.Oliver Geden (2012), The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it, SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01  Vehicles  Under the framework of the European Climate Change Programme, the European Commission was to present in mid- a Communication to the European Parliament and European Council on a revised Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. This review will be based on a thorough impact assessment of the existing Community target of a new car fleet average emission of 120 CO2 g/km and of the possible measures that could form part of a revised strategy based on an integrated approach to CO2 emissions reductions. On 7 February 2007, the European Commission announced plans for new legislation requiring the average carbon dioxide emissions of the vehicles produced in 2012 to be no more than 130 g/km. This is a bit more than the goal of 120, which corresponds to 4.5 L/100 km for diesel and 5 L/100 km for gasoline engines. In March 2011, the European Commission presented the EU Transport Roadmap, which shows pathways to achieve a 60% cut in greenhouse gases from all modes of transport by 2050. = The \\"Yellow Vest\\" protest and the Lessons from it = In 2019 the Yellow vests movement rose in France. One of the main reasons was the high price for fuel, introduced by Emmanuel Macron's government as part of the program to curb emissions from vehicles. Another cause was the reduction of the speed limit with the purpose of saving 200 lives per year. The causes of the anger were the heavy reliance of the rural populations on cars and the disproportionality of the tax: the poor who are the less guilty for the emissions were hit harder. The Macron government cancelled the original plans for a fuel tax, hurting the aim of Greenhouse gas reduction. Many think that the lesson should be: reduce the emissions from vehicles not by tax that hurt the poorest, but by more fairer taxes, making alternatives, for example by Bicycle lanes, Bus lanes, lower prices of Train travel See also *Directorate-General for Climate Action (European Commission) *Climate of Europe * Energy policy of the European Union *Making Sweden an Oil-Free Society * Renewable energy in the European Union *Indian Youth Climate Network References External links * European Climate Change Programme * European Commission Climate Change website * European Commission Climate Action website.

In 1970, Thompson released his only solo album to date, titled Corky's Debt To His Father, on the Texas Revolution label. The album consists instead of ten lyrically dense but warm-hearted pop songs, in various styles – Dylan-inspired blues-rock, Tex-Mex pop-rock with psychedelic touches, and early country rock not dissimilar to the contemporary work of Gram Parsons and the Flying Burrito Brothers. Thompson was backed by studio musicians on the album and none of his usual Krayola cohorts appear. It was recorded in Houston. It was re-released by the Glass label in 1985 and Drag City in 2008. After becoming disillusioned with the American art scene, he moved to London having joined the conceptual art group Art & Language,Keenan, p37 with whom he went on to record six albums: Corrected Slogans (1976), Kangaroo? (1981), Black Snakes (1983), Sighs Trapped by Liars (2007), Five American Portraits (2010). Another album, Baby and Child Care, was recorded shortly after Black Snakes in 1984 with most of the same personnel, but not released until 2016. While in London, he became involved with Geoff Travis's distribution business at Rough Trade Records. When the label decided to begin releasing records in 1978, Thompson was asked to assist in producing them because Travis did not feel that he had enough experience in the studio. Thompson is credited as producer on early records by The Fall, Stiff Little Fingers, The Raincoats, Cabaret Voltaire, Kleenex and many other seminal groups. Working at Rough Trade also led him to reform the Red Crayola with new members from the bands he was working with. The resulting line-up (1979–1983) included a number of important post-punk musicians: Gina Birch of The Raincoats, Lora Logic of X-Ray Spex and Essential Logic, Epic Soundtracks of the Swell Maps, and Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. All members of Pere Ubu, aside from drummer Scott Krauss, contributed to the Soldier Talk album. The band continued its association with Art & Language, who often contributed lyrics to songs such as A Portrait of V.I. Lenin in the Style of Jackson Pollock which references their well-known painting. The song Born in Flames was written for the soundtrack of Lizzie Borden's 1983 radical feminist film of the same name. 1980s In the early 1980s, he was a member of Pere Ubu, performing on their albums The Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man. He also appears on seven of thirteen tracks on the Pere Ubu live album, One Man Drives While the Other Man Screams, and plays accordion on the David Thomas and the Pedestrians album The Sound of the Sand. In 1982 he started to compose the musical score of Victorine, the opera written by Art & Language for the Documenta 7. In 1983 he recorded a series of monologues and vocal tracks for a collaborative effort with German musicians Dieter Moebius and Conny Plank. The recordings were shelved for 15 years but were finally released as Ludwig's Law in 1998. While living in Germany in 1987, he began collaborating with the German painter Albert Oehlen, first on a soundtrack for the film The Last of England by Derek Jarman. The two would later reform the Red Crayola again with an entirely new line-up. Thompson produced the 1986 self-titled debut by the Shop Assistants for the Blue Guitar label. Thompson was also, alongside Geoff Travis, director of the label. He also produced another debut album, \\"Brave Words\\" by The Chills, released in 1987. 1990s-present In the early 1990s, Thompson met the avant-garde guitarist David Grubbs who offered him a chance to release new music with Red Crayola on Drag City in Chicago. Thompson accepted and the Red Crayola roster ballooned again, this time encompassing many of the important post-rock musicians of the time, including members of Gastr del Sol and Tortoise. The group has continued in a more or less similar configuration since 1994. In 1994, he accepted a teaching position at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. In 2008 the association ended. Since 2009 he has lived with his wife and their dog in California, USA.

Biography  Arthur Weigall was born in the year in which his father, Arthur Archibald Denne Weigall, an army officer, died on the North West Frontier. As a young widow, his mother, the former Alice Henrietta Cowen, turned missionary in the inner-city slums of late-Victorian England. So Arthur Weigall went from an unconventional home life in Salford to Wellington College, a school with strong establishment and military connections. He started work as an apprentice clerk in the City of London, but a youthful fascination with genealogy led him to the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt and so into Egyptology. A mysterious patroness encouraged him to apply for New College, Oxford. This was a mistake (Egyptology was not yet studied at Oxford) so before completing his admission tests he went on to Leipzig, hoping to learn German and then enrol in a German university.Julie Hankey, A Passion for Egypt: Arthur Weigall, Tutankhamun and the 'Curse of the Pharaohs', Londra 2007, TPP, pp. 24–25. This didn't happen, and on his return to England Weigall found work with Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, first at University College London and then at Abydos in Egypt. Life with Flinders Petrie was notoriously harsh, and after a while Arthur Weigall went to work for Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing, a German Egyptologist. In early 1905 Howard Carter was staying with Arthur Weigall at Saqqara when after an incident with some French tourists, Howard Carter was forced to resign his post as Chief Inspector of Antiquities for Upper Egypt. Suddenly, at the age of 25, Arthur Weigall was appointed to replace Howard Carter at Luxor, responsible for protecting and managing the antiquities of a region that extended from Nag Hammadi to the border with Sudan. At Luxor, Arthur Weigall threw himself with immense energy into aspects of the job that in his view had been somewhat neglected – the protection and conservation of monuments that were steadily being bought up and moved to Europe and North America. He remained in Luxor until 1911. This was a time of intense activity – the discovery of the tombs of Yuya and Tuya, KV55, the tomb of Horemheb, travels in the Eastern Desert, a popular biography of Akhnaten, a Guide to the Antiquities of Upper Egypt. He worked with Alan Gardiner on the tombs of the nobles and may well have helped Howard Carter to the placement with Lord Carnarvon that led to the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. He was deeply enmeshed in the bureaucratic and social entanglements of Luxor and Cairo, coming into close contact with Flinders Petrie, Gaston Maspero, Theodore Davis, Percy Newberry, Howard Carter and others, and making friends with Sir Ronald Storrs and the wider Edwardian society in Egypt. However, a breakdown took him from Egypt, and World War I cut off his plans to create an institute of Egyptology for Egyptians. In London during World War I Arthur Weigall became a successful set-designer for the London revue stage. An association with film began: he worked with Bannister Merwin, Jack Buchanan, and Phyllis Monkman on the film Her Heritage (1919), and in the 1920s Lord Northcliffe appointed him film critic for the Daily Mail. Later, one of his novels was made into the film Burning Sands (1922) by the producer George Melford. Journalism brought him back to Egypt. He covered the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun as correspondent for the Daily Mail, in direct opposition to Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon's attempts with The Times to monopolise the story, which Weigall regarded as both wrong and politically damaging to British relations with Egypt at a time of strong nationalist feeling. At the tomb of Tutankhamun he saw Lord Carnarvon joke as he prepared to enter the tomb, and is reported as saying 'if he goes down in that spirit, I give him six weeks to live'. Arthur Weigall died in 1934. During his first marriage to Hortense Schleiter, an American, he wrote vivid personal accounts of his life in Luxor and Upper Egypt. His second marriage (to the pianist Muriel Lillie, sister of the comedian Beatrice Lillie) returned him to the world of show business as a talented writer of lyrics.

Some of the senior and probably oldest of these units had special names such as Cornuti or Brachiati; others were named after the tribes from which they were recruited (many of these in eastern Gaul, or among the German barbarians). These units all became palatine units when a distinction was drawn between palatina and the remainder of the comitatenses around 365. There is no direct evidence for the strength of an auxilium, but A.H.M. Jones (History of the Later Roman Empire, Blackwell, Oxford, 1964 p 682) estimates that it may have been 600 or 700. Some auxilia are attested as limitanei, especially on the Danube. It is not clear whether these were regarded as a different category of unit.

Area nightclubs were said to \\"bolster the Yucca Corridor's thriving night life.\\" History By 1993 the Corridor had been dominated for several years by the 18th Street Gang, according to Sharon Romero, leader of the Hollywood Beautification Team, which was formed to paint over graffiti, among other projects. She said gang members had \\"harassed us on the streets, pulled guns on us and kicked our paint cans over.\\" Between May and July of that year the Los Angeles Police Department engaged in a concerted effort to rid the area of gang activity, including the use of additional police and Bureau of Tobacco and Firearms officers.Helene Webb, \\"Violence in L.A.: The LAPD Reports,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 1, 1994, page 2 A 1994 survey by the city's Falcon narcotics program said that the Corridor was one of L.A.'s most drug-infested neighborhoods. In 1995 the police were calling the area a \\"dope supermarket, ... where cocaine dealers ruled the streets and residents hid behind their doors from gunfire after dark.\\" in 1994, however, landowners, impressed by the use of a video camera in the Rodney King episode, began mounting cameras atop buildings, focused on the sidewalks below. They also affixed posters in the neighborhood warning \\"Buy Drugs, Go to Jail\\" and \\"Entering Videotape Surveillance Zone.\\" Volunteer monitors scanned video screens at a nearby police station. Narcotics officers \\"made nearly 500 arrests and confiscated hundreds of grams of cocaine and heroin during an intensive 18-month campaign. Prosecutors pressed landlords to fence off open lots and board up vacant buildings,\\" places where drug where drug dealers congregated. Building inspectors cited owners for broken windows and other violations. These projects were spearheaded by neighborhood watch groups named after local streets, such as the Ivar Hawks, Cherokee Condors and Wilcox Werewolves. Civil libertarians, though, took issue with some aspects of the crime-prevention program. Constitutional law expert Erwin Chemerinsky, for example, said he was \\"troubled by having behavior monitored directly or indirectly by the government, absent probable cause,\\" and others objected to the police attempting to identify suspected drug buyers through license-plate numbers.Duke Helfand, \\"Vigilant Street Cameras Drive Drug Dealers Away,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 20, 1996, page 1Robert J.

Particularly opposed was an application by a 16,800-square-foot Sav-on drugstore at Yucca and North Cahuenga Boulevard. A neighborhood group also claimed that clubs in the Yucca-Ivar Avenue area had been the sites of large fights, and it was noted that the Corridor still suffered 20 percent more reported crime than the city average. In 2007, a Los Angeles Times survey of the area found that \\"Homicides are down but the neighborhood still has a relatively high rate of robberies, burglaries, thefts and assaults. Residents and community activists say they walk freely through the Yucca Corridor during the day but do so with more caution after nightfall.\\" Gateway to Hollywood In 2002, a 30-foot-high triangular glass tower, lighted from within, was installed in a traffic median at the intersection of Cahuenga Boulevard, Wilcox Avenue and Franklin Avenue.

Likewise the MacGowan song \\"Cotton Fields\\" draws on the Lead Belly song of the same name. Critical reception Mark Deming of Allmusic said that Peace and Love \\"isn't as good as the two Pogues albums that preceded it\\", but felt that \\"it does make clear that MacGowan was hardly the only talented songwriter in the band\\". Robert Christgau, on the other hand, believed that \\"Shane MacGowan will remain the only Pogue in the down-and-out hall of fame\\".

Collins was married to photographer Anita Ruthling Klaussen. Education Bud Collins was born June 17, 1929, in Lima, Ohio and grew up in Berea, and was a 1947 graduate of Berea High School in Berea, Ohio, and a graduate of Baldwin- Wallace College, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. After his U.S. Army service, Collins decided to attend Boston University graduate school. He drove the 700 miles from Lima to Boston with \\"The mission: convince Boston University to let him study journalism. The promise: if accepted, he would be an excellent student.\\" He would not graduate from the College of Communications until 2009.For Bud Collins, Tennis Is a Love Game A journalist now synonymous with the game is honored tonight, Boston University. From 1959–1963 he served as the tennis coach at Brandeis University, where one of his players was Abbie Hoffman, class of 1959. Afterward, Hoffman became a political and social activist. At the time of his death in 2016, the 1959 team was the only undefeated tennis team in Brandeis history. Career as a journalist Collins started writing for the Boston Herald as a sportswriter while he was a student at Boston University. In 1963, he moved to The Boston Globe and began doing tennis commentary for Boston's Public Broadcasting Service outlet, WGBH.Bud Collins Speaking at BU Tonight From 1968 to 1972, he worked for CBS Sports during its coverage of the US Open tournament, moving to NBC Sports in 1972 to work that network's Wimbledon coverage. He also teamed with Donald Dell to call tennis matches for PBS television from 1974 to 1977. For several years with The Boston Globe, he was a general and political columnist. He also wrote for the paper's \\"Travel\\" section, recommending the best places to visit. In 1967, he was a candidate for mayor of Boston. During the 2007 Wimbledon tournament, Collins announced that NBC had chosen not to renew his contract and was letting him go. Collins had covered tennis for the network for 35 years. He insisted that he had no plans to retire and would continue to cover tennis for The Boston Globe. On July 8, 2007, the final day of the tournament, fellow Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan, on the ESPN TV show The Sports Reporters, ridiculed NBC for this decision. He said the 78-year-old Collins \\"still has his fastball\\" and praised the Globe for retaining Collins. Collins was hired by ESPN on August 7, 2007. He teamed with onetime NBC partner Dick Enberg on the network's Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, and Australian Open coverage. He has also covered the US Open for XM Satellite Radio. In 1999, Collins was honored by the Associated Press Sports Editors, who awarded him the Red Smith Award, which is America’s most prestigious sportswriting honor. He was inducted in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 2002. Playing career Although Collins described himself as a \\"hacker\\", he was an accomplished tennis player in his own right. He won the U.S. Indoor mixed doubles championship (with Janet Hopps) in 1961, and was a finalist in the French Senior doubles (with Jack Crawford) in 1975. Other activities Collins authored several books, including The Education of a Tennis Player (with Rod Laver, 1971), Evonne! On the Move (with Evonne Goolagong Cawley, 1974), and a memoir, My Life With the Pros (1989). He also produced several tennis encyclopedias, including The Modern Encyclopedia of Tennis, the Bud Collins Tennis Encyclopedia, and Total Tennis. In 1992, Collins was the host of the 116th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on the USA Network. In 1994, Collins was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Collins' trademark was his donning of bow ties and \\"loud\\" pants, which he had custom-made from unique fabrics he collected while traveling for work. According to Bud's website, all of his pants were fashioned by tailor Charlie Davidson in his Andover Shop in Cambridge, MA. In 2006, he made a cameo appearance as himself in the episode \\"Spellingg Bee\\" for the television show Psych. His papers and manuscripts are housed currently at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.Contemporary Collections In September 2015, in recognition of his years of service to tennis, the media center at the US Open Tennis Center was named the Bud Collins Media Center.

It is one of 17 research centers in the United States run by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The center is located on the grounds of the Patuxent Research Refuge, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This is the only National Wildlife Refuge with the purpose of supporting wildlife research.United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Laurel, MD. \\"Patuxent Research Refuge.\\" Accessed 2012-03-31. Research center entrance  Mission  Since its establishment in 1936 as the first wildlife experiment station in the United States, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has been a leading international research institute for wildlife and applied environmental research, for transmitting research findings to those responsible for managing the United States's natural resources, and for providing technical assistance in implementing research findings so as to improve natural resource management. Patuxent's scientists have been responsible for many important advances in natural resource conservation, especially in such areas as migratory birds, national monitoring programs for amphibians and birds, wildlife population analysis, waterfowl harvest, habitat management, wetlands, coastal zone and flood plain management, contaminants, endangered species, urban wildlife, ecosystem management, and management of national parks and national wildlife refuges. The Center develops and manages national inventory and monitoring programs and is responsible for the North American Bird Banding Program and leadership of other national bird monitoring programs. The Center's scientific and technical assistance publications, wildlife databases, and electronic media are used nationally and worldwide in managing biological resources. The research center hosts a wide variety of wildlife. The focus of the Center's mission and vision for the future is to continue its dynamic international, national, and regional leadership in wildlife research. The Center will enhance its accomplishments in generating, interpreting, evaluating, and transmitting the scientific information needed to better address the pressing problems of managing the United States's biological resources, especially those under the stewardship of the Department of the Interior, other Federal and non-Federal partners. Today's challenges in natural resource management involve new approaches such as adaptive management, landscape and ecosystem scale management, partnerships among multiple stakeholders, and transfer and use of the huge store of existing information using modern technology. The Center is a Federal research facility which primarily supports programs in the Department of the Interior. The USGS Biological Resources Division, of which the Center is a part, works with others to provide the information needed to manage the United States's biological resources. Thus, scientific information needs of partner agencies strongly influence much of the Center's scientific agenda. The Center also receives funds directly from agencies benefiting from our research and from other partner organizations, such as those co-located at its Laurel headquarters. Such support provides critical resources that enhance the scope and value of the Center's activities, within the mission of the Division. Science conducted at the Center, like any scientific enterprise, ultimately, is driven by the pressing public natural resource needs coupled with the intellectual creativity and motivation of its scientists and technical staff. No research program will succeed unless it flows from the creative energies of its scientists. The research of Center scientists must be engaged at the cutting edge of scientific understanding to assure the long term success of natural resources management. :Note: much of this material was copied directly from the USGS web page on Patuxent, a public domain resource.

Well-known landholders such as the Snowden and Duvall families owned substantial amounts of land during the colonial period and well through the 19th century. The legacy of the Snowden family can still be found in two historic homes of the area, one of which (Snowden Hall) actually stands on Patuxent Research Refuge property. In addition to these dwellings, there still exists 19 cemeteries between the center and Fort Meade whose headstones bear the inscriptions of both the Snowdens and Duvalls, in addition to lesser- known surnames such as the Woodwards, Donaldsons, and Waters families. Almost all of the that makes up what is now called the \\"North Tract\\" (the Patuxent River bisects the refuge into the North and Central/South Tracts) were transferred in 1991 from the Defense Department's Fort Meade landholdings. It is here that the history of Patuxent Research Refuge is most apparent to the everyday visitor. Prior to the Department of Defense's ownership of the land in 1917, many old roads that would eventually be incorporated into use for training exercises by the Army existed. Part of the DOD's Trainfire Road, now known as the Wildlife Loop, once linked the railroad town of Woodwardville with Laurel, Maryland. Long before the area became a densely wooded haven for wildlife amidst a heavily populated urban corridor, the old Duvall and Lemons Bridges transported people between Prince Georges and Anne Arundel Counties. The former still exists as a newer bridge rebuilt in the 1940s, whereas only cement posts along either side of the river offer any vestige of what was Lemon's Bridge. Perhaps the most historic old road of all, which utilized Duvall Bridge, was the old Telegraph Road. It once linked Baltimore and Washington, and today it is still possible to see century-old telegraph poles along the road in both the Central and South Tracts. In 1946, scientists found that DDT tests was killing wildlife in tree canopies and causing significant fish kills in the Patuxent River. In 2017, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center ended its 51-year effort to breed and train whooping cranes for release, due to budget cuts by the administration of President Donald Trump. The flock of 75 birds will move to the International Crane Foundation and the Calgary Zoo for continued breeding.  Fort Meade  Fort George G. Meade, an active Army base, is near the research center. In October 1991, were transferred from the base to the Patuxent National Research Refuge; in January 1993, another 500 were transferred, as part of Defense Appropriation Bills for 1991 and 1992, respectively.Fort George G. Meade: Current Site Information, Environmental Protection Agency, retrieved January 24, 2008 A September 2007 environmental impact report described the expansion of Fort Meade, and particularly the proposed two additional 18-hole golf courses, as a \\"significant threat to the biological and territorial integrity of the Patuxent Research Refuge, a unique national interest in the forefront of scientific research and protection.\\" In response, the Army said that it is taking steps to limit the environmental damage but that the golf courses are needed for \\"maintaining the quality of life for soldiers and their families.\\" See also * Patuxent River State Park * List of parks in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area  References  External links *USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center *USFWS Patuxent Research Refuge *A Youtube video of the grounds Category:Landmarks in Maryland Category:United States Geological Survey Category:Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Category:Protected areas of Prince George's County, Maryland Category:Biological research institutes Category:Protected areas established in 1936 Category:1936 establishments in Maryland Category:Patuxent River ","title":"Patuxent Wildlife Research Center"},{"id":"2349088","text":"An optimised sheet of smaller rectangles which can be divided intact through the correct series of \\"guillotine\\" cuts.

Vol XI (A-L: January 1921 – December 1925). Kraus Reprint Corporation, Millwood, New York, 1979 (page 310) In the eleven stories, famed eccentric detective Hercule Poirot solves a variety of mysteries involving greed, jealousy, and revenge. The American version of this book, published by Dodd, Mead and Company in 1925, featured a further three stories. The UK first edition featured an illustration of Poirot on the dust jacket by W. Smithson Broadhead, reprinted from the 21 March 1923 issue of The Sketch magazine. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) while the 1925 US edition was $2.00.  Plot summaries  =The Adventure of the Western Star= Poirot receives a visit from Miss Mary Marvell, the famous American film star on her visit to London. She has received three letters, handed to her by a Chinese man, which warn her to return her fabulous diamond jewel, the \\"Western Star\\", to where it came from – the left eye of an idol – before the next full moon. Her husband, Gregory Rolf, who bought it from a Chinese man in San Francisco, gave Mary the jewel three years ago. The pair are going to stay at Yardly Chase, the home of Lord and Lady Yardly when the moon is next full to discuss the making of a film there and Mary is determined to go with her diamond. Both Poirot and Hastings remember society gossip from three years back that linked Rolf and Lady Yardly. The Yardlys also own an identical diamond that came from the right eye of the idol – the Star of the East. After Mary has gone Poirot goes out and Hastings receives a visit from Lady Yardly, who was advised to visit Poirot by her friend Mary Cavendish. Hastings deduces that she too has received warning letters. Her husband plans to sell their jewel as he is in debt. When Poirot learns this he arranges to visit Yardly Chase and is there when the lights go out and Lady Yardly is attacked by a Chinese man and her jewel stolen. The next day, Mary's jewel is stolen from her London hotel. Poirot makes his investigations and returns the Yardly's jewel to them. Poirot tells Hastings that there never were two jewels or any Chinese man – it was all an invention by Rolf. Three years before in the United States he had an affair with Lady Yardly and blackmailed her into giving him the diamond which he then gave to his wife as a wedding present. Lady Yardly's was a paste copy that would have been discovered when her husband sold it. She was starting to fight back against her blackmailer and Rolf arranged the deception against his wife that Lady Yardly copied when Hastings told her of the threats. Poirot's threats manage to persuade Rolf to give the real diamond back and leave the Yardlys in peace. =The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor= Poirot is asked by a friend, who is the director of the Northern Union Insurance Company, to investigate the case of a middle-aged man who died of an internal haemorrhage just a few weeks after insuring his life for fifty thousand pounds. There were rumours that Mr Maltravers was in a difficult financial position and the suggestion has been made that he paid the insurance premiums and then committed suicide for the benefit of his beautiful young wife. Poirot and Hastings travel to Marsdon Manor in Essex where the dead man was found in the grounds, with a small rook rifle by his side. They interview the widow and can find nothing wrong. They are leaving when a young man, Captain Black, arrives. A gardener tells Poirot that he visited the house the day before the death. Poirot interviews Black and by using word association finds out that he knew of someone who committed suicide with a rook rifle in East Africa when he was there. Poirot figures out that this story, told at the dinner table the day before the tragedy, gave Mrs Maltravers the idea of how to kill her husband by making him demonstrate to her how the African farmer would have put the gun in his mouth. She then pulled the trigger. Mr Maltravers is seen by a maid in the garden. She thinks that it is just a mistake, but then in the living room a strange thing happens. The lights suddenly go out and Mrs Maltravers clasps Poirot's hand. Mr Maltravers appears in the room, his index finger glowing and pointing at Mrs Maltravers' hand, which is covered in his blood. Terrified, she confesses. Poirot explains that he hired a man, with phosphorescent applied to his finger, to impersonate Mr Maltravers and turn off the lights. When Mrs Maltravers grabbed Poirot's hand, he put fake blood on hers. =The Adventure of the Cheap Flat= Hastings is at a friend's house with several other people when the talk turns to flats and houses. Mrs Robinson tells the party how she and her husband have managed to obtain a flat in Knightsbridge for a very attractive price. Poirot is interested and decides to investigate. The porter at the flat tells them that the Robinsons have been there for six months, despite Mrs Robinson's telling Hastings they had only just obtained the lease. Poirot rents another flat in the building and, by use of the coal lift, manages to gain entry to the Robinsons' flat and fix the locks so he can enter at will. Japp tells Poirot that important American naval plans were stolen from that country by an Italian called by Luigi Valdarno who managed to pass them to a suspected spy for Japan, Elsa Hardt, before being killed in New York. Hardt fled the United States using the name Robinson. That night, when the Robinsons' flat is empty, Poirot and Hastings lie in wait and apprehend another Italian who has come to kill Elsa Hardt and her accomplice in revenge for the death of Valdarno. They disarm the man and take him to another house in London. Poirot tracked down the two spies there, having previously lived in Knightsbridge as a Mr and Mrs Robinson. In fear of their lives, the spies rented the flat cheaply to a real couple of the same name, in the hope that this innocent couple would be killed in their place. They trick Hardt into revealing the hiding place of the plans before the Italian escapes and Japp arrests the two spies. =The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge= Poirot and Hastings receive a visit from a Mr Roger Havering, the second son of a Baronet who is married to an actress. Mr Havering stayed at his club in London the previous evening and the following morning received a telegram from his wife saying that his Uncle Harrington Pace was murdered the previous evening and to come at once with a detective. As Poirot is indisposed, Hastings sets off with Havering for the scene of the crime. Mr Pace, the brother of Mr Havering's mother, owns a hunting lodge on the Derbyshire moors. When Hastings and Havering arrive there they meet Inspector Japp as Scotland Yard has been called. As Havering goes off with Japp, Hastings speaks with the housekeeper, Mrs Middleton, who tells him she showed a black-bearded man into the house the previous evening who wanted to see Mr Pace. She and Mrs Zoe Havering were outside the room where the two men were talking when they heard a shot. The door to the room was locked but they found an open window; gaining entry, they found Mr Pace dead, shot by one of two pistols on display in the room. The pistol and the man are now missing. Mrs Middleton sends Zoe Havering to see Hastings and she confirms the housekeeper's story. Japp confirms Havering's alibi for his train times to London and his attendance at the club but soon the missing pistol is found dumped in Ealing. Hastings wires to Poirot with the facts but Poirot is interested only in the clothes worn by and descriptions of Mrs Middleton and Mrs Havering. Poirot wires back to arrest Mrs Middleton at once but she disappears before this can happen. Upon investigation, no trace can be found of her existence, either from the agency that sent her or how she reached Derbyshire. Once Hastings is back in London, Poirot gives Hastings his theory – Mrs Middleton never existed. She was Zoe Havering in disguise. Only Mr Havering claims to have seen the two women together at the same time. Havering did go to London with one of the pistols which he dumped and Mrs Havering shot her uncle with the other pistol. Japp is convinced of the theory but does not have enough evidence to make an arrest. The Haverings inherit their uncle's fortune but not for long: the two are soon killed in an aeroplane crash. =The Million Dollar Bond Robbery= The fiancée of Philip Ridgeway asks Poirot to prove his innocence. Ridgeway is the nephew of Mr Vavasour, the joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank and a million dollars of bonds have gone missing whilst in his care. Poirot meets Ridgeway at the Cheshire Cheese to hear the facts of the case: Ridgeway was entrusted by his uncle and the other general manager, Mr Shaw, with taking a million dollars of Liberty bonds to New York to extend the bank's credit line there. The bonds were counted in Ridgeway's presence in London, sealed in a packet and then put in his portmanteau that had a special lock on it. The packet disappeared just a few hours before the liner on which Ridgeway was travelling, the Olympia, docked in New York. Attempts had been made to break into the portmanteau but its lock must have then been picked. Customs were alerted and they sealed the ship that they then searched but to no avail. The thief was selling the bonds in New York so quickly that one dealer swears to buying some bonds before the ship docked. Poirot then questions the two general managers who confirm this story. He then travels to Liverpool where the Olympia has just returned from another crossing and the stewards confirm the presence of an elderly man wearing glasses in the cabin next to Ridgeway, who never left it. Poirot meets back with Ridgeway and his fiancée and explains the case to them. The real bonds were never in the portmanteau. Instead they were posted to New York on another faster liner, the Gigantic, which arrived before the Olympia. The confederate at the other end had instructions to begin selling the bonds only when the Olympia docked but he failed to carry out his orders properly, hence one sale took place half an hour before docking. In the portmanteau was a false packet that the real villain took out with a duplicate key and threw overboard – this was Mr Shaw who claims he was off work for two weeks due to bronchitis whilst these events transpired. Poirot caught him by asking him if he can smoke a cigar, which, given his bronchitis, Shaw should have immediately declined. However, he said yes, convincing Poirot of his guilt. =The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb= Lady Willard consults Poirot. She is the widow of the famous Egyptologist, Sir John Willard. He was the archaeologist on the excavation of the tomb of the Pharaoh Men-her-Ra together with an American financier, Mr Bleibner. Both men died within a fortnight of each other, Sir John of heart failure and Mr Bleibner of blood poisoning. A few days later Mr Bleibner's nephew, Rupert, shot himself and the press is full of stories of an Egyptian curse. Lady Willard's son, Guy, has now gone out to Egypt to continue his father's work and she fears that he will die next. To Hastings' surprise, Poirot states that he believes in the forces of superstition and agrees to investigate. Poirot cables New York for details concerning Rupert Bleibner. The young man was an itinerant in the south seas and borrowed enough money to take him to Egypt. His uncle refused to advance him a penny, and the nephew returned to New York, where he sank lower and lower and then shot himself, leaving a suicide note saying that he was a leper and an outcast. Poirot and Hastings travel to Egypt and join the expedition, only to find that there has been another death in the party, that of an American by tetanus. As Poirot investigates the dig, he feels the forces of evil at work. One night, an Arab servant delivers Poirot his cup of chamomile tea. Hastings hears Poirot choking, after drinking the tea. He fetches the expedition surgeon, Dr Ames. This is, however, a pretext to get the doctor into their tent where Poirot orders Hastings to secure him. The doctor, however, quickly swallows a lethal cyanide capsule. Poirot explains that Rupert was Bleibner's heir, and the doctor, secretly, must have been Rupert's heir. Sir John died of natural causes. His death started superstitious speculation. Everyone assumed that Rupert's friend in the camp was his uncle but that could not have been the case as they argued so frequently. Despite having no money, Rupert returned to New York, which shows that he did have an ally in the expedition. This was a false ally – the doctor, who told Rupert he had contracted leprosy in the south seas and it must be part of the curse. (Rupert merely had a normal skin rash.) After Dr Ames killed his uncle, Rupert believed himself cursed and shot himself. His note refers to the leprosy, which everyone assumed was a metaphorical reference, not a real condition. =The Jewel Robbery at the Grand Metropolitan= Poirot and Hastings are staying at the Grand Metropolitan hotel in Brighton where they meet Mr and Mrs Opalsen. He is a rich stockbroker who amassed a fortune in the oil boom and his wife collects jewellery using the proceeds. She offers to show Poirot her pearls and goes to fetch them from her room but they have been stolen. Poirot is asked to assist. There have only been two people in the room since the pearls were last seen - Mrs Opalsen's maid, Celestine, and the hotel chambermaid. Celestine has orders to remain in the room all of the time that the chambermaid is there. Both girls are questioned and each blames the other. The hotel room has a side room where Celestine sleeps and a bolted door which leads to the room next door. The two maids were in sight of each other all the time except for two pauses of between twelve and fifteen seconds apiece when Celestine went into her room – not enough time to extract the jewel case from the drawer, open it, take the jewels and return the case. Both are searched but nothing is found. Both rooms are then searched and the missing pearls are found underneath Celestine's mattress. The case is seemingly over but Poirot tells Hastings the newly found necklace is a fake. He questions the chambermaid and the valet who looks after Mr Opalsen and asks them if they have ever seen before a small white card he has found. Neither has. Poirot rushes to London and the next day breaks the news to Hastings and the delighted Opalsens that the case is solved and the real pearls found. The chambermaid and the valet were a pair of international jewel thieves – the card he gave them then had their fingerprints on it which he gave to Japp for testing. The valet was on the other side of the bolted door and the chambermaid passed him the case in the first interval when Celestine was in her room. When she next went in there, the chambermaid returned the empty case to the drawer whose runners had been silenced with French polish, traces of which Poirot found in the room next door. The pearls are found in the valet's room and returned to their grateful owners. =The Kidnapped Prime Minister= Towards the end of the First World War, Hastings calls on Poirot in his rooms to discuss the sensational news of the day - the attempted assassination of the Prime Minister, David MacAdam. They are interrupted by two visitors: Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons and Bernard Dodge, a member of the War Cabinet. They enlist Poirot to help with a national crisis – the Prime Minister has been kidnapped. He was on his way to a secret peace conference to be held the next day at Versailles. He arrived in Boulogne-sur-Mer where he was met by what was thought to be his official car but it was a substitute. The real car was found in a side road with its driver bound and gagged. As they tell Poirot the details, news reaches them by special courier that the bogus car has been found abandoned and containing Captain Daniels, the Prime Minister's secretary, chloroformed and gagged. His employer is still missing. Poirot wants to know the full details of the shooting that took place earlier. It occurred on the way back from Windsor Castle when, accompanied by Daniels and the chauffeur, Murphy, the car took a side road and was surrounded by masked men. Murphy stopped and one man shot at the P.M., but only grazing his cheek. Murphy drove off, leaving the would-be murderers behind. The P.M. stopped off at a small cottage hospital to have his wound bandaged and then went straight on to Charing Cross Station to get the Dover train. Murphy has also disappeared, the P.M.'s car being found outside a Soho restaurant frequented by suspected German agents. As Poirot packs to leave for France he voices his suspicions of both Daniels and Murphy and wonders why the shooting by masked men took place before the kidnap. Poirot goes over the Channel with various detectives involved in the case, among them Japp. Once in Boulogne he refuses to join in the search but sits in his hotel room and thinks for several hours. Abruptly, he returns to Britain where he begins a tour of cottage hospitals to the west of London in an official car. They call at a house in Hampstead; the police raid it and recover both Murphy and the Prime Minister. The villain was Daniels who kidnapped both men in the shooting, taking to London substitutes with the \\"P.M.'s\\" face disguised by bandages from a shooting that had never occurred; Poirot's search of the cottage hospitals proved that no one's face was bandaged up that day. Investigation was misdirected to France, when the real P.M. had never left the country. Daniels was known to have a sister near Hampstead but she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, a German spy for whom Poirot has been searching for some time. The real Prime Minister is whisked off to Versailles for the conference. =The Disappearance of Mr Davenheim= Poirot and Hastings are entertaining Japp when the conversation turns to the recent disappearance of a banker, Mr. Davenheim, from his large country house, the Cedars. Boasting, Poirot makes a five-pound bet with Japp that he could solve the case within a week without moving from his chair. The facts of the case are that Davenheim arrived home from the city at midday on Saturday. He seemed normal and went out to post some letters late in the afternoon saying that he was expecting a business visitor, a Mr. Lowen, who should be shown into the study to wait his return. Mr. Davenheim never did return and no trace of him can be found. The police were called on Sunday morning and on the Monday it was discovered that the concealed safe in Davenheim's study was forced open and the contents removed – cash, a large amount of bearer bonds and jewellery. Lowen has not been arrested, but is under observation. He was there to discuss some business in South Africa with Mr. Davenheim, who was in Johannesburg the previous autumn. Poirot is interested that the house has a boating lake, which Japp tells him is being searched tomorrow, and that Mr. Davenheim wears his hair rather long with a moustache and bushy beard. The next day Japp returns with the news that Davenheim's clothes have been found in the lake and that they have arrested Lowen. A common thief called Billy Kellett, known to the police for pick- pocketing, saw Lowen throw Davenheim's ring into a roadside ditch on the Saturday. He picked it up and pawned it in London, got drunk on the proceeds, got arrested and is in custody. Poirot has one question for Japp: Did Mr. and Mrs Davenheim share a bedroom? When the reply is returned in the negative, Poirot knows the solution and tells Hastings and Japp to withdraw any funds they have in Davenheim's bank before it collapses. This predicted event occurs the next day and Poirot reveals the truth. Davenheim knew of his bank's financial troubles and started to prepare a new life for himself. Last autumn he did not go to South Africa but instead took on the identity of Billy Kellett. He served three months in jail at the same time he was supposed to be in Johannesburg and then, to set up Lowen, on the Saturday robbed his own safe before Lowen arrived at the house. When Davenheim 'disappeared' he was already in police custody as Kellett and no one looked for a missing man in jail. Mrs Davenheim identifies her husband and Japp pays Poirot his five pounds. =The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman= Poirot and Hastings are in their rooms with a neighbour, Dr Hawker, when the medical man's housekeeper arrives with the message that a client, Count Foscatini, has phoned for the doctor, crying out for help. Poirot, Hastings and Hawker rush to Foscatini's flat in Regent's Court. The lift attendant there, unaware of any problems, says that Graves, the Count's man, left half an hour earlier with no indication of anything wrong. The flat is locked but the manager of the building opens it for them. Inside, they find a table set for three people, with the meals finished. The Count is alone and dead – his head crushed in by a small marble statue. Poirot is interested in the remains on the table. He questions the kitchen staff at the top of the building. They describe the meal they served and the dirty plates passed up to them in the service elevator. Poirot seems especially interested in the fact that little of the side dish and none of the dessert were eaten, while the main course was consumed entirely. He also points out that after crying out for help on the phone, the dying man replaced the receiver. The police arrive at the flat as Graves returns. He tells them the two dinner guests first visited Foscatini on the previous day. One was a man in his forties, Count Ascanio, and a younger man. Graves said that he listened to their first conversation, and heard threats uttered; then the Count invited the two men to dinner the next evening. Graves says that the next night Foscatini unexpectedly gave him the night off after dinner, when the port had been served. Ascanio is quickly arrested, but Poirot states three points of interest: the coffee was very black, the side dish and dessert were relatively untouched, and the curtains were not drawn. The Italian ambassador provides an alibi for Ascanio, which leads to suspicions of a diplomatic cover-up, and Ascanio denies knowing Foscatini. Poirot invites Ascanio for a talk and forces him to admit that he did know that Foscatini was a blackmailer. Ascanio's morning appointment was to pay him the money he demanded from a person in Italy, the transaction being arranged through the embassy where Ascanio worked. After Ascanio leaves, Poirot tells Hastings that Graves is the killer and explains his reasoning. Graves overheard the monetary transaction, and realised that Ascanio could not admit to the relationship with Foscatini. Graves killed Foscatini when he was alone – there never were any dinner guests - then ordered dinner for three and ate as much of the food as he could; but after consuming the three main courses, he could eat only a little of the side dishes and none of the desserts. Coffee was served for three and presumably drunk, but Foscatini's brilliant white teeth show that he never drank such staining substances. Finally, the open curtains show that Graves left the flat before nightfall and not after, which would not have been the case if the account given by Graves were true. This theory is passed on to Japp, and when he investigates, Poirot is proven right. =The Case of the Missing Will= Poirot receives an unusual request from Miss Violet Marsh. She was orphaned at fourteen years of age, when she went to live with her Uncle Andrew in Devon. He was recently returned from making his fortune in Australia. He was opposed to his niece bettering herself through book learning. Violet rebelled against him and got herself into Girton College some nine years before meeting Poirot. Although somewhat strained, her relations with Andrew Marsh remained cordial. He died a month before she meets with Poirot, leaving a will with a strange clause. The will is dated 25 March and timed at 11:00 am. Marsh gave instructions that his \\"clever\\" niece was allowed to live in his house for one year; in that time she had to \\"prove her wits\\". If at the end of that time she had not done so, all his worldly goods would go to charitable institutions and she would be left with nothing. Poirot and Miss Marsh are convinced that there is either a second will or a sum of money hidden in the house; he agrees to look. Poirot and Hastings travel to Devon, where they are looked after by Mr and Mrs Baker, Marsh's housekeepers. They tell Poirot that they signed and witnessed two wills, as Marsh said he had made a mistake with the first, although they did not see its contents. Immediately afterwards, Marsh left the house to settle tradesmen's accounts. Looking round the house, Poirot is pleased with the dead man's order and method, except for one particular: the key to a roll top desk has been affixed, not to a neat label, but instead to a dirty envelope. After a long search, Poirot declares himself beaten and is about to return to London when he remembers the visit to the tradesmen. He rushes back to the house and holds up the opened envelope to the fire. Faint writing in invisible ink appears, which is a will dated after the one in Violet's possession and leaving everything to her. The two wills signed by the Bakers were a ruse. The tradesmen in town must have signed the true last will, which Marsh turned into an envelope attached to a key. This was left as a deliberate clue. According to Poirot, Miss Marsh proved her superior intelligence by employing Poirot to solve the case. American version of book The American edition of the book, published one year later, featured an additional three stories which did not appear in book form in the UK until 1974 with the publication of Poirot's Early Cases. *The Chocolate Box *The Veiled Lady *The Lost Mine Literary significance and reception The review in The Times Literary Supplement of 3 April 1924 began with a note of caution but then became more positive: > \\"When in the first of M. Poirot's adventures, we find a famous diamond that > has been the eye of a god and a cryptic message that it will be taken from > its possessor 'at the full of the moon' we are inclined to grow indignant on > behalf of our dear old friend the moonstone. But we have no right to do so, > for the story is quite original\\". The review further described Poirot as \\"a thoroughly pleasant and entertaining person\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 3 April 1924 (pp. 209–210) The New York Times Book Review chose to review the 1924 UK publication of the novel in its edition of 20 April that year, rather than wait for the 1925 Dodd, Mead publication. The unnamed reviewer liked the book but seemed to consider the stories somewhat clichéd and not totally original, making several comparisons to Sherlock Holmes. He began, \\"Agatha Christie's hero...is traditional almost to caricature, but his adventures are amusing and the problems which he unravels skilfully tangled in advance.\\" He did admit that \\"it is to be feared that some of the evidence [Poirot] collects would fare badly in criminal courts\\" but concluded, \\"Miss Christie's new book, in a word, is for the lightest of reading. But its appeal is disarmingly modest, and it will please the large public which relishes stories of crime, but likes its crime served decorously.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 20 April 1924 (p. 25) The Observer of 30 March 1924 said, > \\"The short story is a sterner test of the 'detective' writer than the full- > grown novel. With ample space almost any practised writer can pile > complication upon complication, just as any man could make a puzzling maze > out of a ten-acre field. But to pack mystery, surprise and a solution into > three or four thousand words is to achieve a feat. There is no doubt about > Miss Christie's success in the eleven tales (why not a round dozen?) > published in this volume. All of them have point and ingenuity, and if M. > Poirot is infallibly and exasperatingly omniscient, well, that is the > function of the detective in fiction.\\" Unlike The New York Times, the reviewer favourably compared some of the stories to those of Sherlock Holmes and concluded, > \\"We hope that the partnership [of Poirot, Hastings and Japp] will last long > and yield many more narratives as exciting as these. With The Mysterious > Affair at Styles and this volume to her credit (to say nothing of others) > Miss Christie must be reckoned in the first rank of the detective story > writers.\\"The Observer, 30 March 1924 (p. 4) The Scotsman of 19 April 1924 said, > \\"It might have been thought that the possibilities of the super-detective, > for the purposes of fiction, had been almost exhausted. Miss Agatha > Christie, however, has invested the type with a new vitality in her Hercule > Poirot, and in Poirot Investigates she relates some more of his adventures. > Poirot is most things that the conventional sleuth is not. He is gay, > gallant, transparently vain, and the adroitness with which he solves a > mystery has more of the manner of the prestidigitator than of the cold- > blooded, relentless tracker-down of crime of most detective stories. He has > a Gallic taste for the dramatic, and in The Tragedy of Marsdon Manor he > perhaps gives it undue rein, but mainly the eleven stories in the book are > agreeably free from the elaborate contrivance which is always rather a > defect in such tales. Poirot is confronted with a problem and Miss Christie > is always convincing in the manner in which she shows how he lights upon a > clue and follows it up.The Scotsman, 19 April 1924 (p. 11) Robert Barnard remarked that this was one of her \\"Early stories, written very much under the shadow of Holmes and Watson.\\" His critique was that \\"The tricks are rather repetitive and the problems lack variety\\". References in other works The Prime Minister who features in the story The Kidnapped Prime Minister is also referenced in the 1923 short story The Submarine Plans, which was published in book form in the 1974 collection Poirot's Early Cases. It is possible that his name, \\"David MacAdam\\", is a Celtic wordplay on the name of the real Prime Minister during the latter days of the First World War, David Lloyd George. In The Adventure of the Western Star, Lady Yardly was advised to visit Poirot by her friend Mary Cavendish, a long time friend of Hastings. Cavendish appears in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Christie's first mystery novel, and the one which introduced Hercule Poirot to the literary world. Adaptations The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim was presented on television as a thirty-minute play by CBS as an episode in the series General Electric Theater on 1 April 1962 under the title of Hercule Poirot. Introduced by Ronald Reagan and directed by John Brahm, the adaptation starred Martin Gabel as Poirot. The program was made as a pilot for a series that did not happen; instead it was the debut of the character on English-language television. An earlier program starring José Ferrer as Hercule Poirot had been filmed by MGM but never aired and in 1955, German television aired Murder on the Orient Express. All of the stories contained in Poirot Investigates have been adapted as episodes in the ITV television series Agatha Christie's Poirot with David Suchet in the role of Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Hastings, Philip Jackson as Japp and Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon. As is the custom with these adaptations, they differ somewhat from their originals. In the Disappearance of Mr Davenheim, Hastings plays a large role, and, in a complete change from the book, Poirot gets a parrot (leading to one of the famous exchanges: Delivery boy: \\"I've a parrot here for Mr Poy-rott.\\" Poirot: \\"It is pronounced 'Pwa-roh'.\\" Delivery boy: \\"Oh sorry. I've a Poirot here for a Mr Poy-rott.\\"). \\"The Case of the Missing Will\\", in particular, was heavily adapted: the death of Andrew Marsh is changed into a murder. The \\"missing will\\" of the title was also changed: it is not a hidden will but an old document that is stolen from Marsh's papers after it is made clear that Marsh intends to write a new will leaving everything to Violet Wilson (as she is renamed in the adaptation). The ships that feature in \\"The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\\" are changed from the Olympia and the Gigantic to the Queen Mary and the Berengaria.

She had become aware that the six-book contract she had signed with John Lane had been unfair to her in its terms. At first she meekly accepted Lane's strictures about what would be published by them, but by the time of Poirot Investigates Christie insisted that their suggested title of The Grey Cells of Monsieur Poirot was not to her liking and that the book was to be included in the tally of six books within her contract. The Bodley Head opposed this because the stories had already been printed in The Sketch. Christie held out and won her case. =Book dedication= This was the first Christie book to carry no dedication. =Dustjacket blurb= The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead it carried quotes from reviews for In the Mayor's Parlour by J. S. Fletcher, whilst the back flap carried the same for The Perilous Transactions of Mr. Collin by Frank Heller.

It is used by both Arab Muslims and Christians. In Islam, the word refers to the way of life Muslims must adopt to comply with divine law, encompassing beliefs, character and deeds. The term appears in the Quran 98 times with different connotations, including in the phrase yawm al-din, generally translated as Day of Judgment. Etymology The Arabic dīn has Semitic cognates, including the Hebrew \\"dīn\\" (), Aramaic dīnā (), Amharic dañä (ዳኘ) and Ugaritic dyn (𐎄𐎊𐎐). The Arabic sense of judgment is commonly derived from the Hebraeo-Aramaic root. The Hebrew term \\"דין\\", transliterated as \\"dīn\\", means either \\"law\\" or \\"judgement\\". In the Kabbalah of Judaism, the term can, alongside \\"Gevurah\\" (cognate to the Arabic \\"Jabaarah\\"), refer to \\"power\\" and \\"judgement\\".https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Din.html In ancient Israel, the term featured heavily in administrative and legal proceedings i.e. Bet Din, literally \\"the house of judgement,\\" the ancient building block of the Jewish legal system.Fox, Tamar \\"The Bet Din\\" http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-beit-din/ 9/5/2016Rabbi Jonathan Reiss http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/divorcebeit.html Winter 1999 Some scholars such as Nöldeke and Vollers have derived the Arabic sense of religion from the Middle Persian den (revelation, religion) connected with the Zoroastrian notion daena. Others, like Gaudefroy-Demombynes and Gardet, have found this derivation unconvincing. The Arabic sense \\"custom, usage\\" has been derived by classical and modern lexicologists from the Arabic verbal forms dāna (be indebted) and dāna li- (submit to). Louis Gardet sees the Hebraic and Arabic senses as related through the notions of retribution, debt, obligation, custom, and direction, prompting him to translate yawn al-din as \\"the day when God gives a direction to each human being\\". Use in Islam It has been said that the word Dīn appears in as many as 79 verses in the Qur'an,Gulam Ahmed Parwez, \\"Exposition of the Qur'an\\", p. 12, Tolu-E-Islam Trust but because there is no exact English translation of the term, its precise definition has been the subject of some misunderstanding and disagreement. For instance, the term is often translated in parts of the Qur'an as \\"religion\\".For instance, translations of the Qur'an by Marmaduke Pickthall, Shakir, and others. Some Qur'anic scholars have translated Dīn in places as \\"faith\\"For instance, the translation by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, 60:9 Others suggest that the term \\"has been used in various forms and meanings, e.g., system, power, supremacy, ascendancy, sovereignty or lordship, dominion, law, constitution, mastery, government, realm, decision, definite outcome, reward and punishment. On the other hand, this word is also used in the sense of obedience, submission and allegiance\\".Lugh’at-ul-Quran, Ghulam Ahmed Parwez, Tolu-e-Islam Trust, 1941 In addition to the two broad usages referred to so far, of sovereignty on the one hand and submission on the other, others have noted\\"Let Us Be Muslims, Abu Ala Maududi U.K.I.M. Dawah Center, 1960 that the term Dīn is also widely used in translations of the Qur'an in a third sense. Most famously in its opening chapter, al-Fātiḥah, the term is translated in almost all English translations as \\"judgment\\": The well-known Islamic scholar, Fazlur Rahman Malik, suggested that Dīn is best considered as \\"the way-to-be-followed\\". In that interpretation, Dīn is the exact correlate of Shari'a: \\"whereas Shari'a is the ordaining of the Way and its proper subject is God, Dīn is the following of that Way, and its subject is man\\".Rahman F, Islam, p. 100, University of Chicago Press, 1979 Thus, \\"if we abstract from the Divine and the human points of reference, Shari'a and Dīn would be identical as far as the 'Way' and its content are concerned\\".

When Zinn was fired from Spelman at the end of the 1962–63 academic year, Lynd protested. During the summer of 1964, Lynd served as director of the SNCC-organized Freedom Schools of Mississippi. After accepting a position at Yale University, Lynd relocated to New England, along with his wife, Alice Niles Lynd, and their children. In 1965 he gave lectures on 'The History of the American Left' at the Free University of New York. An Updated and revised version of the article published in \\"Les Temps Modernes\\" the magazine of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre September 1968 Vietnam- era activism At Yale Lynd became an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. His protest activities included speaking engagements, protest marches, and a controversial visit to Hanoi along with Herbert Aptheker and Hayden on a fact- finding trip at the height of the war, which made him unwelcome to the Yale administration. As the protest movement became increasingly violent, Lynd began to have misgivings . As a self-described \\"social democratic pacifist\\" and \\"Marxist Existentialist Pacifist\\", he became more interested in the possibilities of local organizing. In 1967, Lynd signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the Vietnam War, and urging other people to also take this stand.\\"An Open Letter\\" archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive Labor activism In 1968, Lynd published his book 'Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism' It came under severe criticism by Marxist professor Eugene Genovese, writing in the New York Review of Books. Professor David Donald in reviewing the book called it \\"a major work in American intellectual history\\" About the Cambridge University 2009 reprint of the book, Commentary Magazine referred to it as an \\"established classic\\". It became clear that Yale would deny Lynd tenure, and he became unemployable in academia.. Lynd relocated his family to Chicago. There, he struggled to make a living from community organizing. Meanwhile, he and his wife, Alice, embarked upon an oral history project dealing with the working class. The conclusions of this work, titled Rank and File, inspired Lynd to study law in order to assist workers victimized by companies and left unprotected by bureaucratic labor unions. In 1973, he enrolled at the University of Chicago law school, where he earned a degree in 1976. Rust Belt activism From there, the Lynds relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, in the heart of the Rust Belt. Working first for the union-side labor law firm of Green, Schiavoni, Murphy & Haines, and then for Northeast Ohio Legal Services in Youngstown, he proved to be a vital participant in the late 1970s struggle to keep the Youngstown steel mills open. He served as lead counsel for six local unions, several dozen individual steelworkers, and the Ecumenical Coalition of the Mahoning Valley which sought to reopen the mills under worker-community ownership. Despite the ultimate failure of those efforts, the Lynds continued organizing in the Youngstown-Warren area.Thomas G. Fuechtmann, Steeples and Stacks: Religion and Steel Crisis in Youngstown, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 7. Staughton Lynd remained extremely active as an attorney, taking on a broad range of cases, including those concerning chemically disabled auto workers and retired steelworkers. Lynd's book, Lucasville, is an investigation into the events surrounding the 1993 prison uprising at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, and voices serious concern over the integrity of legal proceedings subsequent to the event. A memoir of his and Alice's life, Stepping Stones: Memoir of a Life Together was released in January 2009.

Eighteen of the 19 extant species and six subspecies in this family are in the genus Anguilla. They are elongated fish with snake-like bodies, their long dorsal, caudal and anal fins forming a continuous fringe. They are catadromous fish, spending their adult lives in fresh water, but migrating to the ocean to spawn. Eels are an important food fish and some species are now farm-raised, but not bred in captivity. Many populations in the wild are now threatened, and Seafood Watch recommend consumers avoid eating anguillid eels.  Physical Description  Adult freshwater eels are elongated with tubelike, snake-shaped bodies. They have large, pointed heads and their dorsal fins are usually continuous with their caudal and anal fins, to form a fringe lining the posterior end of their bodies. They have relatively well developed eyes and pectoral fins compared to saltwater eels that they use to navigate and maneuver through river bottoms and shallow water. Unlike most eels, freshwater eels have not lost their scales, and instead have soft, thin, scales that are embedded in the epidermis.Coad, B. W., \\"Review of the Freshwater Eels of Iran (Family Anguillidae). Additionally, freshwater eels possess small, granular teeth arranged in bands on the jaws and vomer. Anguillidae do exhibit size- dependent sexual dimorphism. Male anguillids invest more energy into mating with as many females as he can, than they do into growth. Therefore, female anguillids are usually larger, ranging from 1.5 – 3 feet, while male anguillids rarely get larger than 1.5 feet long. Adult anguillidae can vary in color, but normally are brown, olive or olive-yellow, and can be mottled. Coloration matches the floor of rivers and lakes which prevents the eels from being seen by predators while in clear or shallow water. Freshwater eels go through physical changes in their bodies when going to and from the ocean for different stages of life.  Paleontology  There are two important fossils used to date the origin of freshwater eels. The first is the fossil is Nardoechelys robinsi which represents the ancestor to all extant eels, and marks the lower-boundary of the age of anguillidae. The second is Anguilla ignota, which is the fossil that represents the ancestor to all extant freshwater eels and marks the upper boundary of the age of anguillidae. Using these two fossil calibration points, freshwater eels are said to originate between 83 million years ago and 43.8 million years ago. = Nardoechelys robinsi = N. robinsi was found by Italian scientists in 2002 in the Santonian-Campanian Calcari di Melissano, which is a fossil bed located near the town of Nardò. Strontium-isotope stratigraphy concluded the age of N. robinsi to be 83 million years old. The fossil was discovered incomplete and lacked the skull and part of the anterior skeleton. Despite the morphological uncertainty, cranial and branchial features confirmed it was an eel. At first, it was classified the earliest member of the eel family, Ophichthidae (snake eels). However, upon further inspection, the fossil only displayed one synapomorphy of snake eels, and possessed morphological features more congruent with an ancestral anguilliform. Therefore, many phylogenetic studies use this fossil as a calibration point to date crown anguilliforms. Therefore, if the oldest eel is 83 million years old, it can be concluded that anguillidae could not have originated any earlier than that. = Anguilla ignota = The earliest known fossil of an anguillid eel is “Anguilla ignota” and was found in Messel, Germany. The Messel fossil deposit is dated to be 43.8 million years old during the mid-eocene epoch. During this time period, Messel was undergoing intense volcanic activity which resulted in the formation of freshwater maar lakes. A. ignota was found in the geological remains of one of these lakes, which makes it the oldest eel to inhabit a freshwater environment. Arguably, the most defining feature of Anguillidae is the fact that they inhabit freshwater, being the only family of eels to do so. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that A. ignota is the ancestor to all freshwater eels is strongly supported. This fossil is commonly used as a calibration fossil to pinpoint the lower boundary of the age of freshwater eels.  Phylogeny  The exact placement of freshwater eels is still being debated, but there is a general consensus that Anguillidae are firmly nested within Anguilliformes. Traditionally, molecular studies have placed Anguillidae in the subclass \\"Anguilloidei\\" with two other families: Nemichthyidae (snipe eels) and Serrivomeridae (sawtooth eels). Until 2013, this subclass has been lumped together into a cohesive clade. However, recent molecular studies have suggested that Anguillidae are actually more closely related to the Saccopharyngiforms (Gulpers and relatives) than they are to the other Anguilloid families. This leads to two possibilities: Either Anguilloidei is a paraphyletic group, or it was originally delineated inaccurately, and Anguillidae should not be included in this subclass. However, more studies need to be conducted to confirm the placement of freshwater eels within Anguilliformes, and determine the composition of the Anguilloidei subclass.  Distribution and Conservation  Anguillid eels have a global distribution, and inhabit the waters of more than 150 countries. They are mainly found in tropical and temperate waters, except in the Eastern Pacific and South Atlantic. Conservation is difficult for this taxa because not much is known about their life history and behaviors. However, many Aguilllid eels are of conservation concern, including the European eel (A. Anguilla), The American Eel (A. rostrata), the Japanese Eel (A. japonica), the New Zealand Longfin Eel (A. dieffenbachii), and the Indonesian Longfinned Eel (A. borneensis). Threats to these species include: habitat loss/modification, migration barriers, pollution, parasitism, exploitation, and consumption, as eels are a popular food source especially in Asia and Europe. Fluctuating oceanic conditions associated with climate change also make these species vulnerable, with reduced water quality leading to biodiversity loss among the largest threats. In the Northern hemisphere, anguillid eels have had large declines in populations due to a number of reasons including overexploitation and migration inhibition via migration barriers. According to the IUCN Anguillid Eel Specialist Group, or the AESG, the need for conservation of this family is clear given recent declines. However, conservation efforts are being inhibited by a lack of knowledge of the biology of these species, especially in their social and spawning behavior, as well as a lack of long-term data sets.  Commercial Importance  Anguillid eels are important food fish. Eel aquaculture is a fast-growing industry. Important food eel species include longfin eel, Australian long-finned eel, short-finned eel, and Japanese eel. Most eel production historically has been in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but in recent years, the greatest production has been in China. Seafood Watch, one of the better-known sustainable seafood advisory lists, recommends consumers avoid eating anguillid eels due to significant pressures on worldwide populations. Several species used as unagi have seen their population sizes greatly reduced in the past half century. Catches of the European eel, for example, have declined about 80% since the 1960s. Although about 90% of freshwater eels consumed in the US are farm-raised, they are not bred in captivity. Instead, young eels are collected from the wild and then raised in various enclosures. In addition to wild eel populations being reduced by this process, eels are often farmed in open-net pens, which allow parasites, waste products, and diseases to flow directly back into wild eel habitat, further threatening wild populations. Freshwater eels are carnivores so are fed other wild-caught fish, adding another element of unsustainability to current eel- farming practices.  Ecology  Freshwater eels are aquatic and live in various habitats, including freshwater, estuaries, and saltwater/marine habitats, and occupy the roles of both predator and prey, and evidence has been found of nematode parasitism in some species. Some eel species have been observed consuming the eggs of predatory fish such as trout, aiding in population control in these systems. Juvenile eels occupy small spaces in between rocks, in crevices or mud. Freshwater eels are widespread and are catadromous, meaning they spend most of their life in freshwater (rivers mainly) and migrate to the ocean to breed. Leptocephali (larval) migration can range from months to up to almost a year. Temperate eels migrate on average for approximately 6-10 months, while tropical eels undergo shorter migrations between approximately 3-5 months on average. The European eel (A. anguillidae) has one of the longest migrations of all freshwater eels, migrating up to 6000 km (over 3700 miles) in a single migration loop. Migration loops may be flexible in some species, and this variability is still being investigated. However, some eels in this family have altered their migration loop to become completely marine, not returning to fresh waters to develop. Ocean-resident eels are the exception of this family, and this behavior may be more common in areas in which the freshwater habitat is of lower quality or productivity. = Reproduction and Life Cycle = Anguillid eels are semelparous, meaning they only live to reproduce once, as they die after reproduction. However, these eels do not necessarily reproduce every year-they will sometimes wait until conditions are right in order to migrate and breed. The European eel can spawn starting at 7 years old, and the oldest of this species that has been found in the wild was 85 years of age. These conditions may include fat content, water quality or temperature, prey availability, river height and water flow rate, etc. This variability allows some eels to live even 50-70 years, however the lifespan of freshwater eels is not well documented. Very little is known about the mechanics of fertilization and spawning, and the time it takes these eels to hatch from their eggs is variable. Tsukamoto and associates found evidence of Japanese eels (A. japonica) may synchronize their breeding cycles during the spawning season with the new moon. Members of this family spend their lives in freshwater rivers, lakes, or estuaries, and return to the ocean to spawn. All eels pass through several stages of development through their life cycle. Anguillid eels undergo morphological changes during these developmental stages that are associated with environmental conditions and aid in preparing them for further growth and finally reproduction. Anguillid eels begin their life as an egg in the ocean, and once hatched, enter a larval stage called leptocephali. The young eel larvae live only in the ocean and consume small particles called marine snow. Anguillid eels lay adhesive demersal eggs (eggs that are free-floating or attached to substrate), and most species have no parental care. Japanese eels (A. japonica) can lay between 2 million and 10 million eggs. These planktonic (free floating) eggs and translucent, leaf-like larvae are dispersed via ocean currents and migrate sometimes thousands of miles. They grow larger in size, and in their next growth stage, they are called glass eels. At this stage, they enter estuaries-upon returning to freshwater growing habitat, the eels become pigmented and develop through the elver and yellow eel stages. The yellow and silver eel stages are named aptly for the coloration of the underbelly of the eel during these developmental stages. Elvers travel upstream in freshwater rivers, where they grow to adulthood. Finally, anguillids transition through the silver eel stage into adulthood and migrate to the oceanic breeding grounds to reproduce and begin the cycle anew. The discovery of the spawning area of the American and European eels in the Sargasso Sea is one of the more famous anecdotes in the history of ichthyology. The spawning areas of some other anguillid eels, such as the Japanese eel, and the giant mottled eel, were also discovered recently in the western North Pacific Ocean. = Behavior = Eels in the family Anguillidae are known to be primarily solitary in nature; they are not known to communicate socially or actively school, however large masses of elvers can be found as a result of synchronicity in response to environmental conditions. These eels are known as generalists and opportunistic feeders; most will consume whatever acceptable prey they happen upon, including things like crustaceans, fishes, and other aquatic fauna. Aside from their reduced pectoral fins, eels lack of paired appendages: use axial-based lateral undulation as means of locomotion, similar to snakes. High maneuverability of trunk is adaptation for hunting in structurally-complex habitats such as reefs. Some species are known to burrow into the sea bed/sediment, including species that utilize head-first or tail-first burrowing techniques. This is related to both foraging and anti-predatory behavior. Freshwater eels have several natural predators such as large fish and piscivorous birds. Much is unknown about Anguillid eel behavior and its origins, due to the difficulty in observation, particularly in the context of reproduction, social constructs, and migration.  Sensory  Anguillidae unlike its other relatives have a fully developed lateral line along their trunk. Lateral lines provide the ability for Anguillidae to sense their surrounding environment through water displacement which aids in predation and hunting especially because they are predominantly nocturnal generalists. Olfactory senses in this family are heightened for various reasons. Within the nasal sac are olfactory cells which have the capability of detecting extremely diluted chemicals as low as three to four molecules. This is extremely helpful in their nocturnal endeavors as well as for migratory purposes. They use terrestrial odors as cues in migration as well as low salinity and colder temperatures to direct themselves. Geomagnetic sensing has been identified as one of the most important specialized senses in this family. Unlike the other relatives the Anguillidae are catadromous meaning they must migrate for an extended period and depending on what life stage they are in they may be in the open ocean. The Anguillidae were placed in “magnetic displacement” experiment where the geomagnetic north could be altered, and their actions could be monitored. The results showed that at different stages of life, the Anguillidae, are capable of responding to the geomagnetic field and will alter their direction of interest accordingly. They depend on the intensity and inclination of the magnetic field to migrate. Within this experiment they also looked at how the glass eel may rely on the circatidal rhythm in the ocean to work its way back to the coast and into the freshwater systems, but it is not yet fully understood.  Physiology  Paired frontal bones of skull make for a stronger cranium which aids in their variable burrowing tendencies with mud as well as maneuvering through terrestrial obstacles when hiding under rocks and logs that they encounter at the waters bottom where they spend most of their time during the day. Ventral lateral gill slits make up eighty-five percent of gas exchange and are highly efficient in converting between salt and freshwater. This feature really separates the Anguillidae, freshwater eels, from other eels who have internal gill chambers. Many species have variegated skin which means they will vary in color depending on their environment so that they can maintain the highest grade of camouflage. Since the dorsal, anal and caudal fins are fused there is no need for pelvic fins. Dorsal fin begins mid body creating a long continuous fin where in other species it begins more posterior and is not as prominent in length. Their body movement depends highly on undulation originating near the anterior axial end. Due to the fins being fused we see a highly skilled swimmer amongst the Anguillidae which aids in migration and hunting/predation. It was mistakenly reported that Anguillidae lack a scapular bone after further research and more advanced staining techniques they have a scapula and coracoid which make up their pectoral girdle. The prescience of a scapula is important in muscle attachment and allows for the upper head to move in various directions as well as increase strength of body undulation increasing swimming capabilities. Scapula presence also allows for stronger movements of pictorial fins which aid in movement across terrestrial obstacles. Understanding the complete anatomy really plays a role in the direction of studies for this specific family of which we know very little about.  Other Features  Cutaneous respiration accounts for approximately fifteen percent of their oxygen intake but when they are out of water, they are cable of receiving approximately fifty percent of their oxygen through gas exchange via the outer integument. This is an important feature since Anguillidae at many times need to move between bodies of water to maintain an aquatic environment. It is also known that they will burrow down into mud so having the capability to exchange gas outside of water is highly beneficial to this family. It is known that when bodies of water start to dry up the Anguillidae burrow down into the mud and wait for rain while undergoing torpor. Since rain is not predictable torpor allows for the organism to lower its metabolic rate as well as its body temperature increasing its survivability. Anguillidae are great swimmers due to their axial muscle attachment and W shaped myomeres giving them the capability of swimming backwards just as well as they can swim forward. Not many other fish can do so. Since their mouths are not very large, they use their swimming capabilities to aid in feeding where they will bite onto their food and twist/spin rapidly tearing off a piece perfectly sized for them. Population density sex determination is a feature where the Anguillidae regulate their population’s gender depending on the abundance of eggs present. High egg concentrations will result in more male than female ratios as well as vice versa. It does not mean that the eggs will all become one sex but rather have a higher ratio in one of the two sexes present. Mucous cells within epidermis are found in both the non-sexually mature and sexually mature adult stages. The mucous cells are made of glycoproteins which are found in higher concentrations on dorsal and ventral sides of body. It is believed that the family Anguillidae has higher concentrations of slime than other families. This aids in predation as well as helping keep themselves moist outside of water increasing efficiency of cutaneous respiration. Metamorphosis is a big part in the lives of Anguillidae and many changes happen in preparation for migration amongst the adults going from the yellow eel stage to the silver eel stage. The gas bladder adapts for higher pressures which it'll be exposed to in the ocean where it will dive much deeper in search of food and avoiding strong currents. Fat reserves increase in preparation for less abundant food sources in the ocean. Females will experience a higher increase than males for the reason of egg production. The eyes also change increasing in size by two times and retinal pigments which are sensitive to red light in shallow waters change to pigments that are sensitive to blue light which is better adapted for the deep ocean that the silver eel will be experiencing. One experiment talked about the driving force that is seen in Anguillidae. When held in captivity it was reported that they would hit their heads against the glass or make fast for an escape route most likely looking for the fresh or saltwater they seek. This was a key indicator that they are constantly migrating.

Crowd control can involve privately hired security guards as well as police officers. Crowd control is often used at large, public gatherings like street fairs, music festivals, stadiums and public demonstrations. At some events, security guards and police use metal detectors and sniffer dogs to prevent weapons and drugs being brought into a venue.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/police-out-in- force-at-sydney-soundwave-and-future-music-festivals/story- fni0cx12-1227242497588  Equipment  Materials such as stanchions, crowd control barriers, fences and decals painted on the ground can be used to direct a crowd. A common method of crowd control is to use high visibility fencing to divert and corral pedestrian traffic to safety when there is any potential threat for danger. Keeping the crowd comfortable and relaxed is also essential, so things like awnings, cooling fans (in hot weather), and entertainment are sometimes used as well. Thus, restrictive measures and the application of force can actually make crowding more dangerous, for instance during the Hillsborough disaster. For controlling riots and demonstrations, see riot control. Specific products that are used to implement line management and public guidance in high traffic areas include retractable belt systems (which incorporate a stanchion post and the retractable tape) and wall mount systems (also incorporating a retractable belt but are surface mounted). Post and rope systems are also popular, especially in banks and theaters. = History = The History of crowd control starts back in the 1920s, where there was no official crowd control unit. There would be ten to 20 officers lined up. Behind one line there would be another line about twenty feet back. The Officers were armed with batons and axe handles. Their job is to simply hold the crowd back, which would just end in a free for all and resulting in multiple officer injuries. Later in the 1950s the first actual riot control teams armed with riot shields and batons. The goal was for the riot shield officers to hold up the lines. When they came to actual contact with the crowd the officers with the batons were supposed to help the riot shield officers. However, if deadly forced was used against them there was no training or procedure to counter this. The officers at this point were left to fend for themselves. Finally in the 60s and 70s we first see the use of tear gas. However, with this new innovation the officers were not used to operating in an environment where visibility was limited. The armor that they wore at the time was not as mobile. This resulting in that type of armor being rarely used. A crowd controller is also another name for a bouncer or doorman.

Education and career Born on April 1, 1805, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cadwalader received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1821 from the University of Pennsylvania and read law in 1825. He entered private practice in Philadelphia from 1825 to 1855. He was Solicitor for the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia in 1830. He was Vice Provost of the Law Academy of Philadelphia from 1833 to 1853. He was a Captain in the Pennsylvania State Militia in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1844, which was called out for the Philadelphia Nativist Riots. Congressional service Cadwalader was elected as a Democrat from Pennsylvania's 5th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 34th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1857. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1856. He briefly resumed the practice of law in Philadelphia. Federal judicial service Cadwalader was nominated by President James Buchanan on April 19, 1858, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania vacated by Judge John K. Kane. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 24, 1858, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on January 26, 1879, due to his death in Philadelphia. He was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground at the old Christ Church in Philadelphia. He was succeeded by Judge William Butler, who was nominated by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Family Portrait of the jurist's son, John Cadwalader Jr.His granddaughter, Mary Cadwalader Rawle, painted by William Oliver Stone (1868) Cadwalader was the son of Mary (née Biddle) Cadwalader (1781–1850), of the Philadelphia Biddle family, and military leader Thomas Cadwalader (1779–1841). Among his siblings was General George Cadwalader. His paternal grandfather was General John Cadwalader and his great-grandfather was Dr. Thomas Cadwalader. His maternal grandfather, Clement Biddle, was also a military leader, having served under George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Cadwalader first married Mary Binney (1805–1831), daughter of Horace Binney, an Anti-Jacksonian United States Representative known for his public speeches; he founded the Hasty Pudding Club at Harvard. Together, Mary and John had two daughters, Following his first wife's death from complications of childbirth, he married Henrietta Maria Bancker (1806–1889) with whom he had six children. Through his eldest daughter Mary, Cadwalader was the grandfather of Mary Cadwalader Rawle (1850–1935), who was married on March 24, 1870 to Frederick Rhinelander Jones, the brother of Edith Wharton; their daughter in turn was landscape architect Beatrix Cadwalader Jones Farrand (1872–1959). Cadwalader's grandson, John Cadwalader III (1874–1934), became trustee of the estate of his aunt Sophia Georgiana (née Fisher) Coxe (1841–1926) which funded the MMI Preparatory School.

Survival knives are knives intended for survival purposes in a wilderness environment, often in an emergency when the user has lost most of his/her main equipment. Most military aviation units issue some kind of survival knife to their pilots in case their aircraft are shot down behind enemy lines and the crew needs tools to facilitate their survival, escape, and rescue. Survival knives can be used for trapping, skinning, wood cutting, wood carving, and other uses. Hunters, hikers, and outdoor sport enthusiasts use survival knives. Some survival knives are heavy-bladed and thick. Other survival knives are lightweight or fold in order to save weight and bulk as part of a larger survival kit. Their functions often include serving as a hunting knife. Features, such as hollow handles, that could be used as storage space for matches or similar small items, began gaining popularity in the 1980s. Custom or semi-custom makers such as Americans Jimmy Lile, Bo Randall, and Chris Reeve are often credited with inventing those features.  Origins of the survival knife  Prior to the late 19th century, outdoorsmen and military personnel did not use knives that were notably different from the knives used by butchers. Blades were relatively thin and the handles were often no more than two wooden slabs riveted to the tang. Serrations appeared on knives in the 19th century for use as a wood saw or fish scaler. Around the turn of the century, Webster L. Marble introduced the modern concept of the \\"hunting knife.\\" These knives incorporated heavier blades, crossguards, and pommels. They very much resembled miniaturized Bowie knives. Case, Cattaraugus, and other cutlery manufacturers soon introduced similar knives of their own and it is from these that the modern concept of the survival knife is descended. These knives, along with machetes and bolos constituted survival knives as used by military, explorers, and outdoorsmen up through at least the 1930s. During WWII, survival knives were issued to aircraft crew, as it was a real possibility that these personnel might be shot down over wilderness or behind enemy lines. Lifeboats aboard naval vessels also frequently contained survival kits including knives. These knives varied in design from one branch of the service to another and from one nation to another. The majority of them were simply commercial knives purchased in bulk by the military. From the Vietnam-era and to present, purpose-built survival knives evolved. One of Randall's designs which became a popular fighting knife for troops in Vietnam was the Number 14 \\"Attack\\" Model. During Vietnam, Randall received feedback from a Combat Surgeon in the US Army's 94th Medical Detachment named Captain George Ingraham. Ingraham's request was for serrations on the spine to cut through the fuselage of downed aircraft to rescue trapped personnel and a hollow handle to allow storage of survival gear. Randall made the changes and the result was the first of the modern survival knives. Some militaries (including Finland, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, Germany, Soviet Union and United States) have redesigned the bayonet used with their issued rifle to include survival knife features. Historically, bayonets had functioned poorly as field knives, due to being designed primarily to turn a rifle into a thrusting weapon and only secondarily (if at all) to work as a field knife. The newer models function more acceptably for mundane tasks while remaining capable of being attached to the muzzle of a rifle. Features of a survival knife Survival knives are designed for work such as setting traps, cutting branches, carving wood, and skinning animals. Most survival knives have fixed blades that are 10 cm to 20 cm (3.9 - 7.9 inches) long with a full thick tang. Survival knives made by Aitor, Lile, Parrish, Randall, or Reeve have hollow handles, which allow the user to store additional equipment in the handle. Some of these knives feature a compass in the cap. A hollow handle survival knife may have reduced strength and may break more easily when performing tasks such as chopping or batoning. On some survival knives, the spine or back of the blade is flat; allowing it to make a good hitting platform when pounding it with a hard stick to aid in splitting wood. Other models such as Lile's and Parrish's feature a serrated spine or in the case of Rob Simonich's and Strider Knives, a band (strapping) breaker near the tip. For survival knives that have a distinct flat spine with sharp 90 degree edges, the user can strike the spine edges against a ferrocerium rod to create sparks for fire starting purposes. If the knife has a strong tip, then the knife can also be used as a weapon for self defense. Some knives even include holes in the handle such that the knife can be fastened to a long stick and then it functions as a spear tip. The capability to mount the knife on a stick to create a spear allows the user to better hunt wildlife at a safer distance. The handle material of survival knives differs from one to the next and is determined primarily by user preference. Handle materials can be hardened rubber, wood, bone (horn), aluminium, polymer, or even metal, such as stainless steel in the case of the Aitor Jungle King I, or tool steel as used in the Chris Reeve One-Piece line. Makers like Lile, Strider, and Parrish often wrap these metal handled knives with cord which can be used in survival situations and in daily use provides a more comfortable and reliable grip. In a situation where the knife handle breaks, if the knife is full tang, users can also wrap the handle area of the tang with cord to create a functional makeshift handle and not lose the functionality of the knife. Aircrew Survival Egress Knife The serrations seen on Aircrew Survival Egress Knife (ASEK) are intended to allow air crewmen to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. Those knives that do include functional saw-teeth still suffer from lack of blade length, limiting the thickness of what can be cut when used as a saw.

It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter. The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire.

Its formula is CH3(CH2)8COOH. Salts and esters of decanoic acid are called caprates or decanoates. The term capric acid is derived from the Latin \\"caper / capra\\" (goat) because the sweaty, unpleasant smell of the compound is reminiscent of goats. Occurrence Capric acid occurs naturally in coconut oil (about 10%) and palm kernel oil (about 4%), otherwise it is uncommon in typical seed oils.David J. Anneken, Sabine Both, Ralf Christoph, Georg Fieg, Udo Steinberner, Alfred Westfechtel \\"Fatty Acids\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It is found in the milk of various mammals and to a lesser extent in other animal fats. It also comprises 1.62% of the fats from the fruit of the durian species Durio graveolens. Two other acids are named after goats: caproic acid (a C6:0 fatty acid) and caprylic acid (a C8:0 fatty acid). Along with capric acid, these total 15% in goat milk fat. Production Capric acid can be prepared from oxidation of the primary alcohol decanol by using chromium trioxide (CrO3) oxidant under acidic conditions. Neutralization of capric acid or saponification of its triglyceride esters with sodium hydroxide yields sodium caprate, CH3(CH2)8CO2−Na+. This salt is a component of some types of soap. Uses Capric acid is used in the manufacture of esters for artificial fruit flavors and perfumes. It is also used as an intermediate in chemical syntheses. It is used in organic synthesis and industrially in the manufacture of perfumes, lubricants, greases, rubber, dyes, plastics, food additives and pharmaceuticals. =Pharmaceuticals= Caprate ester prodrugs of various pharmaceuticals are available. Since capric acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester with a drug will increase its lipophilicity and its affinity for adipose tissue. Since distribution of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a depot injection) by using its caprate form. Some examples of drugs available as a caprate ester include nandrolone, fluphenazine, bromperidol, and haloperidol. Effects Capric acid acts as a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, and this is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects. This direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by capric acid in the brain contributes to the anticonvulsant effect of the MCT ketogenic diet. Decanoic acid and the AMPA receptor antagonist drug perampanel act at separate sites on the AMPA receptor, and so it is possible that they have a cooperative effect at the AMPA receptor, suggesting that perampanel and the ketogenic diet could be synergistic. Capric acid may be responsible for the mitochondrial proliferation associated with the ketogenic diet, and that this may occur via PPARγ receptor agonism and its target genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Complex I activity of the electron transport chain is substantially elevated by decanoic acid treatment. It should however be noted that orally ingested medium chain fatty acids would be very rapidly degraded by first-pass metabolism by being taken up in the liver via the portal vein, and are quickly metabolized via coenzyme A intermediates through β-oxidation and the citric acid cycle to produce carbon dioxide, acetate and ketone bodies. Whether the ketones β-hydroxybutryate and acetone have direct antiseizure activity is unclear.

First Intermediate Period, Dynasty XI, c. 2108-2059 BC. From Thebes. El-Tarif ( aṭ-Ṭārif) is a necropolis on the West Bank of the Nile, at the site of ancient Thebes (Luxor), Egypt. It is located in the northwestern outskirts of Luxor and southeast of the Valley of the Kings, opposite Karnak, just to the southwest of the modern village of At-Tarif. It is the oldest of West Thebes' necropolises. It is a small mortuary temple, and the farthest north of the Tombs of the Nobles, and contains tombs of the late First Intermediate Period, Second Intermediate Period and early Middle Kingdom. Old Kingdom mastabas are possibly attributed to local rulers of the Fourth or Fifth Dynasty. Eleventh Dynasty (2040–1991 B.C.E.) tombs of local rulers have also been noted in the form of a series of rock-cut tombs dated to 2061-2010 B.C.E, the largest of which are Intef I to Intef III, who were kings of this dynasty. Background The El-Tarif tombs are located to the north on the West Bank of Luxor. Here are more than 30 known archaeological sites of temples have been discovered. This site is between Dendera and Gebelein on the flood plains of the Nile River, beyond Malqata in the south up to El-Tarif in the north. One access to the West Bank is across the new Nile Bridge and the other access is to cross the Nile by ferry from Luxor Corniche to El-Gezira. The Theban dynasty ruled from Thebes, which was the capital of Upper Egypt. Intef I was a local Egyptian ruler at Thebes. He was a member of the 11th Dynasty during the First Intermediate Period. He was the first ruler who adopted the title of Pharaoh. He was an important nomarch and his name finds mention in Thutmose III's chapel. Intef II who was also called a Pharaoh was his brother who ruled for 50 years from 2112 to 2063 B.C.E.

He attended Qala primary school, then the Lyceum in Victoria, Gozo. He then moved to the United States and continued his studies in New York, where he settled permanently. By the age of 20 he had several poems published in anthologies in London and New York City. History =Writing= Best known for Pastorale (1978), Poeticus I & II (1986) and (1992), and the very first book he ever wrote in his late teens Wizard's Spider Mystic Glider (1989) which are written in a classical style; he received criticism when he later introduced a more modern style in his experiments and improvisational poetry. In the last few years he returned to his earlier style in works like The Wisdom of Stones (2002), Remnants from the Book of Time (2002), and The Procession (1999). Although for the last 25 years Buttigieg has been writing only in English and very little in his native Maltese, his subject matter still includes a great deal of influence from his native Malta. =Music= Ray Buttigieg since the age of ten became extremely interested in music when he started to sing Latin hymns on the gallery of the grand pipe organ at St Joseph's church. He was also attracted to pieces of metal of various sizes, weights and alloys as well as short wave radios where he thought the combination of these found instruments are uniquely musical that could be used as effects. He later learned the guitar and started to write songs for his first rock improvisational band. =With Cykx= Buttigieg started his professional musical career in New York and Philadelphia where he fronted a six piece glam/rock band Cykx where his catchy tunes mixed with his lyrical poetry produced two top ten pop hits in the mid-seventies. At the same time synthesizers and computers and several electronic music experiments on tape were becoming more interesting to Ray Buttigieg than bandmates who could never agree on anything. Soon the band was defunct and a new project band started. Ray Buttigieg/Cykx, Cykx being the computer that replaced the members of the band. The pop or rock compositions now became explorations and experiments in sound. Compucircuit 0.008 m/s (1981), Mechanism of Thought (1984) were both very ground breaking albums. Buttigieg believed that electronic synthesisers was a third 'high' in music, the first and second being acoustic and electric instruments. =Solo Work= Buttigieg embarked on a solo career ever since he set eyes on his first keyboards, a Mellotron. He was involved in multiple projects at the same time while being involved in solo major works and other series concepts like Earth noise and Sound Science Series in the 70's and The Symphonic Poems, Music for and Diary of an Earthling series in the 80's. Film and Video work were also becoming a very interesting avenue to combine visuals, poetry and as the music soundtrack that would define the visuals all done under the same roof. He continued his career by producing some influential and lush albums like Sound of Transformation – Symphonic Poem No.1 (1982), Quantum Mechanics (1985), Music for Movies (1986), Codes (1987) and Musical Instincts of Nature. Producing records and collaborating Since the very beginning of his career in the mid-70's, Buttigieg has been sought after for creative guidance, collaborating, producing and as the idea man. His string of credits include in Rebellion, Process and After Thought in the 80's, and in the 90's co-wrote songs and produced bands like Novi Mystici, Prosper Falls, Selfish like Magnets and Noise Button. In the last few years of the new millennium Buttigieg has written songs for other artists in the genres of popular music/pop song, gothic format and has gone aggressively into everything electronic whether it is electronica, ambient, new age or electronic producing and collaborating with bands like FTSG, Dyr3, System 6, Desire becomes Being and Circa 2000 AD for Cykxincorp and Standing Stone Recording Company record labels part of Cykxincorp Group of Companies.

In 1997 he moved to John Wordin's Comptel Data team, entering races he described as \\"A thousand times easier than being in Europe.\\" He had a successful season becoming US National Time Trial Champion, and was 3rd in the National Road Race. His successes led to him signing for U.S. Postal Service cycling team. He won the time trial of the Dauphiné Libéré and finished 2nd overall to Alexandre Vinokourov after losing the general classification leadership on the final stage. He then went on to win the Route du Sud in preparation for the Tour de France as part of Lance Armstrong's team that went on to Armstrong's first win. In that Tour, he earned the nickname \\"El Gato\\" (The Cat in Spanish), having landed on his feet after being thrown headfirst over his handlebars in the first stage. In the second stage, he cut his chin in a crash and had to abandon the race. This started his reputation as a somewhat innocent victim in a long series of ill-timed crashes, with an uncanny knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In 2000, Vaughters joined the French team Crédit Agricole. In the early part of the season he was third in the Tour Méditerranéen, sixth in Paris-Nice and in the Critérium International. In June, he was fifth in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, after placing fourth in the stage including Mont Ventoux. In July, he participated in the Tour de France and abandoned during the tenth stage after a fall on the descent of the Col de Marie-Blanque. In 2001, he won the time trial in the Dauphiné Libéré, and the Duo Normand with teammate Jens Voigt. During the Tour de France, he was part of the winning team in the team time trial. He was again forced to retire from the Tour, however, suffering from a wasp sting above his right eye during the 14th stage Bacon, E. (2014). The Best of Luck. In: E. Bacon and L. Birnie, ed., The Cycling Anthology: Volume One. London: Yellow Jersey Press, pp.178-191. (the UCI prohibited the use of cortisone injected intramuscularly or intravenously for the treatment of wounds, although it could be directly injected, e.g. for tendonitis). In 2002, he participated in his fourth and final Tour de France as a rider but failed again to reach the end of the race. He abandoned at the eleventh stage after falling in the descent of the Col d'Aubisque. Following the abandonment, he requested and received the termination of his contract with Crédit Agricole which had been due to run until the end of 2003. He retired from racing, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. After returning to America he signed in 2003 for the U.S. team Prime Alliance 2003. He ended his career as a cyclist at the end of that year. Vaughters was a specialist climber and was touted as a Stage race specialist. He won the Mont Ventoux stage of the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in 1999 and 2001, and held the record for the fastest ascent until it was broken by Iban Mayo in 2004. Vaughters also holds the Cycle To The Sun record time of 2:38 set in 1992 for climbing Haleakala volcano on Maui, Hawaii.www.cyclingnews.com – the world centre of cycling The record however has been unofficially beaten by Ryder Hesjedal in 2010, who climbed the volcano in 2:32.  Managerial career  During 2003 Vaughters launched the new 5280/Subaru junior team originally based in Colorado. Recruitment was done by Vaughters and Prime Alliance director Roy Knickman with Colby Pearce as the head Sporting Director. In 2004, Vaughters took effective management of the team and in 2005 it was split between the 5280 junior team and the continental team TIAA-CREF. In early 2005 Vaughters met Doug Ellis at the launch party for the new season. A computer engineer specializing in financial management software, Ellis was a huge fan of cycling since the 1980s. From 2006, the team became the property of sports management Slipstream Sports, chaired by Doug Ellis with a view to creating an American Pro-Tour team by 2009. In 2007, with the absence of a title sponsor, the team operated under the name Slipstream, and later Slipstream Sports – powered by Chipotle. A professional continental team in 2007 and a ProTour team in 2009 they participated for the first time in the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia in 2008. In February 2009, Jonathan Vaughters was elected president of the International Association of Professional Cycling Groups (AIGCP). Vaughters' Garmin-Cervélo squad took the top position in the team classification in the 2011 Tour de France. Doping experience and reflections Vaughters states that he used erythropoietin (EPO) for the purpose of blood doping during 1996-2000, through organized doping schemes on the Santa Clara and U.S. Postal racing teams. He also observed other forms of doping by U.S. Postal riders, and he independently doped using EPO during 2002, until reconsidering his ethical choices. In August 2012, Vaughters published an opinion column in 'The New York Times' entitled 'How to Get Doping Out of Sports' in which he stated his opposition to doping and expressed his regret over taking drugs during his cycling career.

Plot summary The Troubleshooters (player characters) are tasked with taking a bag full of Communist propaganda to the trash. While on their way, they hear a loud explosion. Upon investigating, they discover a cyrogenic box from which emerges one of the Complex's original programmers, Clem. The Troubleshooters are immediately arrested and charged with causing the explosion and being in possession of Communist propaganda. They are sentenced to be executed live on the Alpha Team Show. They are rescued by Clem, and accompany him to Des Moines to gather the resources needed to reboot the Computer. When the Troubleshooters follow Clem's instructions, The Computer crashes permanently. This programming error was called \\"The MegaWhoops\\" in later Paranoia adventures. Subsequent adventures took place in the era known as \\"PostMegaWhoops.\\" Publication history The Iceman Returneth was written by Sam Shirley, with a cover by Bret Blevins, and illustrations by Valerie Valusek, and was first published by West End Games in 1989 as a 40-page book. In 2010, a sequel to this adventure by Allen Varney, The Iceman Returneth Again, appeared in the three-adventure anthology None of This is My Fault published by Mongoose Publishing for their reboot of the Paranoia franchise. In the introduction, Varney calls the \\"MegaWhoops\\" plotline of the original adventure \\"massively controversial\\", saying that it \\"heralded the impending wipe-out of Paranoia’s viability as a continuing game line.\\" Reception In the March-April 1990 edition of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer (No. 88), Leo Eric Shepherd liked this scenario, saying, \\"The adventure is well-written and quite humorous, and the illustrations, though a departure from the stark Paranoia norm, are well-done. The players get exposed to a bewildering variety of life- threatening events, sure to confuse even the cleverest player.\\" In a 2010 article about adapting various role-playing adventures to the Doctor Who Role- Playing Game, Nick Seidler suggested The Iceman Returneth would be a good candidate for this, noting, \\"Played by itself the game is a bit of a comedy, importing it to Doctor Who, a GM can keep it a comedy or make it high drama.\\" References Category:Paranoia adventures ","title":"The Iceman Returneth"},{"id":"2349220","text":"Cherwell is a weekly student newspaper published entirely by students of Oxford University. Founded in 1920 and named after a local river, Cherwell is a subsidiary of independent student publishing house Oxford Student Publications Ltd. Receiving no university funding, the newspaper is one of the oldest student publications in the UK. History Cherwell was conceived by two Balliol College students, Cecil Binney and George Adolphus Edinger, on a ferry from Dover to Ostend during the summer vacation of 1920 while the students were travelling to Vienna to do relief work for the Save the Children charity. Edinger recalls the early newspaper having a radical voice: \\"We were feeling for a new Oxford …. We were anti-convention, anti-Pre War values, pro- feminist. We did not mind shocking and we often did.\\" The publication was independent of the University of Oxford and it was entirely financed, staffed, and owned by students. Early editions combine this seriousness with whimsy and parochialism. The first editorial gives the newspaper's purpose as being \\"to exclude all outside influence and interference from our University. Oxford for the Oxonians\\". Cherwell was the only newspaper printed in Britain during the UK General Strike of 1926, other than the British Gazette and the British Worker, during which time it was produced at the offices of the Daily Mail in London. Throughout the 1920s Cherwell had a strong literary focus, and a policy of not editing literary contributions. Undergraduate contributors included Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, John Betjeman, L. P. Hartley, Cecil Day- Lewis and W. H. Auden. The newspaper's focus broadened over the coming decades until January 1953, when the owners of the paper decided to turn it into a university newspaper. In 1946 Cherwell was briefly banned by the university for distributing a survey on the sex lives of undergraduates, and in 1954 ran a series of pin-up photographs entitled \\"Girls of the Year\\". In 1970 then- editor Peter Stothard published a current Oxford theatre poster featuring a naked female, possibly a first for a British newspaper. Under his editorship Cherwell also published a backless photo of Gully Wells, considered very daring for the time. Both editions caused much comment. In 1973 the paper became a 'cause celebre' in the national papers when the Cherwell published a photo of General Editor David Soskin with a topless model. This resulted in a personal fine by the proctors for David Soskin. In 1964, the newspaper's longest-running feature was created, the \\"John Evelyn\\" gossip column, and it has run almost uninterrupted since then; its founding editors were Christopher Meakin and Michael Morris. Meakin then moved over to become Editor of Isis the following term, in days when the parallel undergraduate magazine (although not then linked with Cherwell) also appeared weekly. Over the decades, many famous people have been the subject of \\"John Evelyn\\"s wry and faux-condescending style, among them future Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, politician Jonathan Aitken, and actor Imogen Stubbs. In 1981, Hugh Grant is described as \\"New College's answer to Brooke Shields\\", and his unsuccessful attempts to infiltrate a ball with his date are reported. Cherwells Editor in Michaelmas Term 1964 had been Patrick Marnham, who on leaving Oxford became a staff journalist on Private Eye, the British satirical magazine, and was author of the standard reference book on the history of the magazine which Marnham wrote as its 21st birthday celebration in 1982. The Editor for the following Hilary Term 1965 was Martin Linton, who became the Labour member of parliament for Battersea. Linton's News Editor on Cherwell, Sarah Boyd-Carpenter, is better known today as Baroness Hogg. In the mid-1970s Cherwell survived one of its periodic financial crises, and politically the paper campaigned against Oxford University's investments in apartheid-era South Africa. Organisation Cherwell is published by Oxford Student Publications Ltd, a student-run publishing company. Cherwell staff are Oxford students who run the paper while studying for their degrees. Editors and deputy editors are elected termly by the Board of Directors, also largely made up of former editors and business staff. The editors determine the rest of their team, usually consisting of three news editors, two comment editors, two lifestyle editors, two fashion editors, a photo editor, two culture editors, two sports editors and two broadcasting editors, as well as their respective deputies. All positions may be held jointly, more commonly in the junior positions. Section editors hold their own section meetings, at which any student may participate. Guest contributors are commonly employed, often Oxford-educated national figures. Scoops The engagement of Charles, Prince of Wales to Diana Spencer was announced in a Cherwell world exclusive, after the news leaked to the paper through a connection working in the British royal household. News that Chelsea Clinton planned to study for a master's degree at Oxford was also first published in Cherwell. The 2009 hotly contested contest for the Oxford Professor of Poetry Chair was covered by the paper. It broke the story that sexual allegations against applicant Derek Walcott were being created by persons linked to applicant and eventual winner Ruth Padel. Politics Cherwell has no party political line or stated political sympathy. A broad range of views is expressed, and the centre of gravity tends to change frequently, owing to the rapid turnover of editorial staff. Cherwell and the English language The Oxford English Dictionary lists the terms 'sherry party' and 'Marxism' (as pertaining to the Marx Brothers) as having been coined in Cherwell. Additions from recent decades are lacking probably because Cherwell is only sporadically lodged at copyright libraries, and because it is not included in electronic text search systems such as LexisNexis. Xerox University Microfilms has micro-fiche copies of the paper for some years, especially the 1970s.

As a professional makeup artist, Brown created 10 simple lipsticks that evolved into a global beauty empire. Brown has written nine books about beauty and wellness and is a New York Times bestselling author. Since leaving her billion-dollar company Bobbi Brown Cosmetics in October 2016, she has launched Beauty Evolution, LLC and was certified as a health coach through the Institute of Integrative Nutrition.

In addition, she and her husband Steven Plofker reimagined The George, a 32-room design-inspired boutique hotel located in Montclair, New Jersey. Logo of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois. Brown graduated from Emerson College in Boston with a self- directed degree in theatrical makeup and photography. In 1980, she moved to New York City to work as a professional makeup artist. Brown became known for a makeup style that included moderate and natural tones, which was a stark contrast to the bright colors used at the time. She and a drugstore chemist created a line of ten lipsticks on beige pigment. In 1991, Brown and her husband partnered with another couple to launch the brand Bobbi Brown Essentials, which debuted at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City. The revolutionary success of her makeup line prompted Estée Lauder to buy the company in 1995, retaining Brown as an employee of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics. In October 2016, Brown stepped down from the company. Her work has since been featured on the covers of magazines such as Elle, Vogue, Self and Town & Country. Brown served as Yahoo Beauty's Editor-in-Chief from February 2014 to February 2016. A chance meeting with the grandmother of an NBC Today Show producer led to a 12-year run as a regular beauty consultant on the show. Brown is currently the Beauty and Lifestyle Editor of Elvis Duran and The Morning Show, and she continues to work editorially, penning columns for PureWow, Naturally, Danny Seo, and her own modern lifestyle platform, JustBOBBI.com. Brown has received the Glamour Woman of the Year Award, The Fashion Group International Night of Stars Beauty Award, and The Jackie Robinson Foundation’s ROBIE Humanitarian Award, to name a few. She was appointed by President Obama to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation and has been inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. She also holds honorary doctorates from Montclair State University, Fashion Institute of Technology, Monmouth University, and Emerson College. Bobbi Brown Essentials In 1990, Brown worked with a chemist to come up with ten natural lipstick shades. In 1991, the ten shades debuted under the name Bobbi Brown Essentials at Bergdorf Goodman. She was expecting to sell 100 in a month but instead sold 100 in a day. The following year, she released yellow-toned foundation sticks. Estée Lauder Companies Inc. bought Bobbi Brown Essentials in 1995; Brown retained complete creative control of the makeup line. In 2007, the first freestanding Bobbi Brown Cosmetics retail store opened in Auckland, New Zealand with a makeup school in the back. In 2012, Bobbi Brown's cosmetics were estimated to represent approximately ten percent of Estée Lauder Companies' total sales. As of January 2014, there were approximately thirty free-standing Bobbi Brown cosmetics stores. In December 2016, it was announced that Brown would step down from the company by the end of the year.

The band was founded by Steve Nardelli, Chris Squire, Andrew Pryce Jackman, Martyn Adelman and John Painter. Chris Welch, in his book, Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes wrote, \\"The Syn were very similar to Yes in fact. It was very much a precursor of Yes.\\"Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes by Chris Welch Early years The Selfs were a rhythm and blues band formed in 1964 in Wembley, London. The band was formed of bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Andrew Pryce Jackman, drummer Martyn Adelman, and guitarist John Wheatley, and singer Chris Slater. A future line- up included drummer Mike Richardson. The band played their first gigs at The Graveyard, a youth club at St. Andrew's church in Kingsbury, and Blackbirds Cross in Wembley. In 1964, they took part in Ready Steady Win, a music competition run by the producers of the music television show Ready Steady Go! They were beaten in a heat of the competition by the eventual winners, the Bo Street Runners. The Selfs recorded an acetate \\"Love You\\" and a cover of the Who's \\"I Can't Explain\\". The roots of The Syn are in an earlier north London R&B; band called High Court including Steve Nardelli on guitar and his school friend George Arzimanow on vocals. The band evolved over time and, in 1965, with Nardelli now handling lead vocals and John Painter on guitar, they changed their name to The Syn. Shortly after, however, in 1965, The Syn merged with The Selfs, so Nardelli and Painter were joined by Chris Squire (bass), Andrew Jackman (keys) and Martyn Adelman (drums). The band's first gig, at Nardelli's school, Kingsbury County Grammar School, included covers of \\"Heat Wave\\" and The Marvelettes' \\"I'll Keep On Holding On\\". Paul Korda produced his composition \\"Merry-go-round\\" as a demonstration record for the band. Psychedelic period John Painter was replaced by Peter Banks and Martyn Adelman was replaced by Icelandic drummer Gunnar Jökull Hákonarson (born 13 May 1949, Reykjavík, Iceland; died 22 September 2001) usually referred to as Gunnar Jökull or Jökullinn (literally meaning Jökull \\"glacier\\"). The band also got a new manager, Peter Huggett, former bass player with Lonnie Donegan. Huggett was later replaced by Kenny Bell as manager. The band moved away from R&B; covers and started writing their own material, led by Jackman and Nardelli. Reflecting the musical changes going on around them, they became more influenced by psychedelic music. They released two singles titled Created by Clive (b/w Grounded) and Flowerman (b/w 14 Hour Technicolour Dream) in 1967. In 1967, they played in support of The Jimi Hendrix Experience at the Marquee Club in London, attended by many rock luminaries (including The Beatles) that introduced Hendrix to the music world. The Syn went on to have a long-running residency at the club, supporting bands including Pink Floyd., The Moody Blues, Cat Stevens and Procol Harum before establishing their own weekly headline night at which they launched their Gangster and Flowerman rock operas. Later line-ups saw a number of different drummers play after Hákonarson returned to Iceland. Aftermath The band split up in 1967. Both Squire and Banks then joined Mabel Greer's Toyshop which was eventually renamed Yes. Nardelli, Jackman and sometimes Squire also worked together after the band split up. Nardelli and Jackman recorded a planned further Syn single, entitled \\"Sunshine and Make Believe\\", with session appearances by Tony Kaye on keys and David O'List on guitar. Unfortunately, tapes for this session could not be located in 2004. Jackman recorded another Syn piece with an orchestra, \\"The Last Performance of the Royal Regimental Very Victorious and Valiant Band\\", eventually released on the 2004 compilation Original Syn. Another Syn piece, \\"Mr White's White Flying Machine\\", was released in 1970 by Ayshea in a session produced by Jackman and with Squire on bass. Jackman continued to work with Squire, including on his first solo album Fish Out of Water and on Yes's Tormato. Squire has emphasised Jackman's role on Fish Out of Water, saying he offered him co-writing credits, but Jackman declined.Fish Out of Water deluxe edition, video interview Reunion The Syn reunion grew out of two events. In 2003, Martyn Adelman contacted the webmaster of a Yes fan site and agreed to do an interview. Steve Nardelli saw this and was put back in touch with Adelman. With Banks too, they met up for lunch and discussed a reunion. Around the same time, Andrew Jackman died, and there was a desire to mark his passing. In 2004, the new band started rehearsals. Banks had brought in keyboard player Gerard Johnson, with whom he had worked on several previous projects. John Wetton was originally to have played bass, but pulled out at the last minute and was replaced by Steve Gee (bassist in progressive rock band Landmarq). The sessions produced new versions of old Syn songs \\"Illusion\\" and \\"Grounded\\" and an extended new version of Yes' song \\"Time and a Word\\". Recordings were carried out at the studio owned by guitarist Paul Stacey. However, Banks did not continue on with the group, and gave an explanation on his web site. Nardelli continued with the band and, in late 2004, he and Johnson had begun recording on a new song \\"Cathedral of Love\\" when Nardelli asked Squire if he could play on the tune. Squire did and went on to join the band. Paul Stacey became the guitarist and his twin Jeremy Stacey, the drummer. Adelman had chosen to step away from performing, although he remained associated with the band for a period as a photographer—photography rather than drumming having been his career for over 30 years. The band released their first full studio album Syndestructible in October 2005, with Cathedral of Love coming out beforehand as a single. The lineup of musicians performing on that album is * Paul Stacey - guitars, engineer, co-producer * Gerard Johnson - keyboards, co-producer * Steve Nardelli - vocals * Jeremy Stacey - drums * Chris Squire - bass, backing vocals An interviewer at the MWE3 website described Syndestructible as \\"one of the best prog-rock albums of the new century\\" and \\"a masterpiece of beat-prog.\\" Richie Unterberger for Allmusic said, \\"It's rather like hearing a slightly middle-of-the-road version of Yes, with plenty of multi-sectioned song structures and progressive rock interplay between the instruments. [...] It's well executed and well recorded. But it should have been credited to Steve Nardelli and Chris Squire, or a different band name than Syn, as the links to the '60s Syn sound are virtually absent.\\" The More Drama Tour, scheduled to begin in North America in August 2005, was to have seen three acts, The Syn, White and Steve Howe touring together, with Squire, Howe, White and Geoff Downes playing Yes material at the end of the evening (with either Steve Nardelli or Kevin Currie of White handling lead vocals). However, the tour was cancelled shortly before it was due to begin. The Syn line-up for the tour was to have comprised: * Francis Dunnery - guitars * Gerard Johnson - keyboards * Steve Nardelli - vocals * Gary Husband - drums * Chris Squire - bass The Syn album line-up debuted live at a show in London at the end of 2005 (assisted by Husband), but for live dates in January 2006, the band was: * Steve Nardelli - vocals * Chris Squire - bass guitar * Gerard Johnson - keyboards * Shane Theriot - guitar * Alan White - drums A UK tour in May that year was cancelled and, on 16 May 2006, Squire announced his departure from the group: \\"Chris has decided to leave the Syn, and is no longer involved with that band despite reports to the contrary.\\" Nardelli assembled an album, Armistice Day, combining a new studio track (\\"Armistice Day\\", recorded with Johnson and P. Stacey) with live work from 2006 recorded at XM radio studios in Washington DC(with Steve Nardelli, Chris Squire, Alan White, Gerard Johnson and Shane Theriot). Although Johnson recorded and mixed the track, he claimed he was never paid for his work. In an 18 October 2006 message on Yesworld.com, Chris Squire discouraged fans from purchasing the album. The album was released without the permission of any of the artists, other than Nardelli. Both Johnson and P. Stacey left the band. While a release date in November 2006 was initially announced, legal action saw the album delayed until 2007. Meanwhile, Johnson and the Stacey brothers continued to work with Squire. Chris Squire, Gerard Johnson and Jeremy Stacey worked with two of Andrew Jackman's brothers (Jeremy Jackman and Gregg Jackman) on Chris Squire's Swiss Choir album, while Squire, Johnson and both Staceys began working on another Squire solo project. Work on this stalled, but Jeremy Stacey appeared on the debut album from Squackett, with Squire and Steve Hackett. The Squackett album and two Yes albums (Fly from Here and Heaven & Earth) include material co-written by Squire and Johnson and others. New line ups In June 2007, Nardelli said, \\"The Syn today is me and the musicians I chose to play with.\\" Nardelli formed a new Syn line up in 2008, as follows: * Steve Nardelli - vocals * Francis Dunnery - guitars * Tom Brislin - keyboards The band recorded a new album, Big Sky, released early 2009, with Brett Kull and Paul Ramsey, both of the band echolyn, and Dorie Jackson. Big Sky was voted the best progressive rock album of 2009 at USA Progressive Music website. In October 2008, Umbrello Music Entertainment released a digital track written by Nardelli for the musicians from The Syn fan forum called \\"Reasons and Rituals\\". Band members included Steve Nardelli (vocals/guitars), Steve Sikes-Nova (vocals), Cary Clouser (flute), Steve Nicholas (keys), Kevin Stills (guitars/mixing), Brett Kull (guitars) and Kelly Child (drums). The executive producer for the project was radio station host and teacher Steve Sikes-Nova. The project was named 14 Hour Technicolour Dream V-Band after the Nardelli/Jackman written Syn track. A US tour began (with Nardelli, Dunnery, Brislin, Kull, Ramsey, Jackson and Jamie Bishop) in April 2009, including 2 days of music workshops and charity concerts for the students at Gloucester High School in Virginia, but was cancelled after 6 dates when Nardelli had to return to England following the creation of his eco town project being accepted by the UK Government,<> with the band breaking up acrimoniously as a result. The final performance was on 1 May 2009 at Rosfest and was recorded for future release, scheduled for 27 April 2015. Kull commented on the end of the tour, saying: Kull, Ramsey, Brislin and Bishop went on to work with Dunnery subsequently. In December 2010, Nardelli announced a new collaboration with Swedish band Moon Safari, known for their artistic rock sound and five- part harmonies. Recording sessions began in December 2010 in Skellefteå, Sweden. The resultant new Syn album was scheduled for release in 2011. A member of Moon Safari said in October 2014 that, \\"The project is still in the works, but due to the work load of both parties, with Moon Safari playing live and recording new material while working day time jobs and Nardelli working on his projects outside of music, there has not been enough time left to get together and start recording for real. The tracks are done and sound fantastic, we just need to find a space in our schedules to enter the studio.\\" In an interview for Progzilla radio on 25 October 2014, Nardelli confirmed final recording for the album was scheduled for early December 2014 and January 2015. He also announced the release in early 2015 of The Syn Live at Rosfest, recorded 2009, coupled with a newly commissioned movie entitled The Syn in the 21st Century. Umbrello Records announced in January 2015 that Jonas Reingold, Swedish bass player with the Flower Kings and Karmakanic, was producing the Trustworks album. Trustworks was released in March 2016 with the vinyl version of the album to follow in August 2016 and Jean-Pierre SCHRICKE of Highland magazine led many glowing tributes to the band declaring 'THE SYN is one of the mainstays of present progressive'. Original guitarist John Painter died in 2016. The vinyl edition of the Syndestructible album was released in November 2018. This included a link to a previously unseen video of the Syn at the Marquee, the only live performance by the incarnation of the musicians that recorded what has been described as one of the best albums of the 21st Century: Steve Nardelli; Chris Squire; Paul Stacey; Gerard Johnson; Jeremy Stacey.

Based on real-life incidents and individuals, the film depicts organized crime in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, and how the State Police worked to tackle it. It shows the turbulent journey of Ajay Kumar, a newly appointed 31-year-old SSP of Lucknow, played by Arshad Warsi, instrumental in bringing together a group of committed police officers under the aegis of Special Task Force. The force, given with a single agenda, succeeds in challenging the might of organized crime in the Uttar Pradesh. In the process, what unfolds is the ever-changing dynamics of Uttar Pradesh's Siyaasat: railway contracts, Inter-Services Intelligence involvement, politician-Mafia-police-builder nexus, pro-activism of criminal gangs, sophisticated yet rigid red tape and criminalization of university students. The movie is loosely based on the encounter of the notorious criminal Shiv Prakash Shukla (alias Shri Prakash Shukla) who was eliminated by the newly formed Special Task Force of the Uttar Pradesh Police. He was not only a dreaded gangster but also a connection between the underworld and the politicians. The character of SSP Ajay Kumar is based on SSP and the then STF chief Arun Kumar, a 1985 batch IPS Officer. This movie was released along with director Shoojit Sircar's Yahaan on 25 July 2005. However, business for both movies were highly affected due to heavy flood in Mumbai on 26 July 2005. Therefore, both the movies flopped at box office. Although, both the movies have special mention of good performance and good story. Sehar was one of the films featured in Avijit Ghosh's book, 40 Retakes: Bollywood Classics You May Have Missed.'' Plot The film begins with Professor Tiwari (Pankaj Kapur) being interviewed about police encounters and bids to eradicate organised crime from Lucknow and its surrounding areas. It then showcases Ajay Kumar (Arshad Warsi). Since he was young, Ajay has been traumatised by the death of his army officer father, who killed himself when accused of being a deserter, leaving his widow Prabha (Suhasini Mulay) to bring up Ajay on her own. Ajay studies hard and successfully becomes an Indian Police Service officer with the title of Senior Superintendent of Police of Lucknow. Due to his honesty, he gets transferred to various states in India, around 14 times in eight years. At his new posting in Uttar Pradesh, he comes to terms with a new criminal boss and ruthless killer, Gajraj Singh (Sushant Singh). Meanwhile, he falls in love with his childhood friend Anamika Kant (Mahima Chaudhry), with his mother subsequently deciding to get them married. Ajay engineers the setting up of a Special Task Force to deal with Gajraj. However, he also runs into problems as Gajraj is politically well-connected. Gajraj continues to elude the Task Force, using more modern technology such as the use of cell phones. But the Task Force recovers and is able to monitor Gajraj's cell phones with the help of Prof. Tiwari. They find out that Gajraj is planning to contest the elections and if he wins, no police officer of any rank, even the Task Force, would then dare to arrest him or even consider him a suspect, which may well result in the Task Force being mere paper tigers. They have a final confrontation inside a train which leaves from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station. All the officers in the Task Force as well as members of Gajraj's gang kill each other in the fight, leaving Prof. Tiwari as the only witness.

During 1842–1845 Perner was responsible for construction of several railways in the Austrian Empire. Career Perner was born to a water-mill owner and his wife. During 1830–33 he studied at an engineering school in Prague led by František Josef Gerstner. When Gerstner looked for engineers for construction of railways in Sankt Petersburg area of Imperial Russia, Perner joined the project (1836). Due to problems in communication with Gerstner he left in the same year. In 1837 Perner began work at the state railway company and was gradually promoted to take responsibility for construction works. In 1842 he started to design and oversee construction of important railways between Prague – Pardubice – Olomouc and Prague – Dresden. Water Mill in Bratčice: Birthplace of Jan Perner The railway from Prague to Pardubice (over 100 km) was finished in 1845. On 9 September 1845, while Perner was returning from an inspection trip he looked out of the window of a moving train (near Choceň). His head hit a pole, and he was severely injured and died the next day. He has the dubious fame of being the first person to die in a railway accident in Bohemia. Today one of the faculties of University of Pardubice is named after him: Jan Perner Transport Faculty (Dopravní fakulta Jana Pernera) . An InterCity class train of railway operator České dráhy bears the name Jan Perner.

They eat Antarctic krill, fish, and small squid. They feed while swimming but can dive from both the surface and the air.ZipCode Zoo (16 Jul 2009) Taxonomy and systematics The Antarctic petrel is the only known species of the genus Thalassoica in the family Procellariidae of the order Procellariiformes. Also, this petrel along with the snow petrel, the Cape petrel, both giant petrels, and the two species in the Fulmarus family, are considered to be a separate group from the other Procellariidae members.Tree of Life (27 Jun 2008) They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the petrels are on the top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. On petrels, one of these plates forms the hooked portion of the upper bill. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.Double, M. C. (2003) Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988) =Etymology= The word petrel is derived from St. Peter and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrel's habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.Gotch, A. T. (1995) Description The adult Antarctic petrel has a brown head, sides, throat, and back. Their bill is black and their feet are yellow. Their underparts are white and their tail and secondaries on their wings are white with brown tips.ZipCode Zoo (19 Jun 2009) Distribution and habitat The Antarctic petrel, as its name implies, lives and breeds in the Southern Ocean, and on the Antarctic islands.Clements, James (2007) Status This petrel has an occurrence range of and between 10 and 20 million adult birds based on a 2009 estimate. With these numbers and the large range, this bird has been classified as least concern, by the IUCN.BirdLife International (2009) Footnotes References    *  External links  * Antarctic petrel photos Antarctic petrel Category:Birds of Antarctica Antarctic petrel ","title":"Antarctic petrel"},{"id":"2349261","text":"Sylvain ChavanelProcycling, UK, November 2008 (born 30 June 1979) is a French former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2000 and 2018 for the , , and two spells with the / team. His brother Sébastien Chavanel also rode as a professional cyclist. Sylvain Chavanel was noted as a strong all-rounder who won both sprints and time-trials, and was a good northern classics rider, taking 45 wins during his professional career. Background Chavanel was born in Châtellerault, France, although his family roots are in Spain. His great-grandparents were from Huesca, in the Aragon region. His grandfather was born in Barcelona and moved to Châtellerault during the Spanish Civil War. Other members of the family still live in Aragon. He said: \\"Last year [2007], when the Vuelta was in Zaragoza, I got to know the cousin of mine using a journalist as the translator and she gave me a picture of my grandfather when he was young. Despite my origins, I hardly know a word of Spanish – just swear words\\". As a child he played in the garden with models of racing cyclists. He said: :We've got quite a big family and we're all into cycling. I remember playing out in the garden with my three brothers and sister with little figures that we gave names to. I was usually Greg LeMond, then later I went on to be Miguel Indurain then eventually Laurent Jalabert. I remember LeMond's accent. I liked the way he spoke French. I just thought he was a nice guy and I liked his style of riding.Procycling, UK, February 2003 Chavanel began cycling at Châtellerault school when he was eight. He gave up to try football, then went back. :I started cycling again at 12 and from then on I improved every year. I was a fragile little thing, immature physically. I used to finish races halfway down the girls' field and at the back of the boys'. Everything changed the day that I beat my elder brother, Frédéric, in the cadet category, although he was better than me at the time. Racing career He began racing when he was 13. He won 29 races on the road as a schoolboy and a junior. He won the national junior individual pursuit championship in 1997. His uncle, Philippe Raby, a former rider in the Vendée region, recommended him to Jean-René Bernaudeau who was building a professional team based there. Bernardeau saw Chavanel race for the first time at Montreveau, in Maine-et-Loire, when he was racing against riders from Bernardeau's Vendée U junior team. =Bonjour (2000–2004)= Bernardeau and Chavanel agreed that Chavanel would spend another year with his club, AC Châtellerault, which had spent time and money on his training. Bernardeau's assistant, Thierry Bricau, was given the job of providing Chavanel with a training programme. Chavanel rode the Tour de l'Avenir in 1999 and then in 2000, aged 21, he turned professional for Bernardeau's Bonjour team, sponsored by a chain of local newspapers. He won the first stage of the Circuit Franco- Belge and lost his leader's jersey only on the last day. He also won the climbers' jersey in the Tour de l'Avenir by breaking clear in the Pyrenees and rode alone at the front of Paris–Tours. Bernardeau said: :Sylvain has some of the faults I had as a young rider. He's always working at the front of the race – you have to rein him in for his own good. At his age, life is beautiful and risks are there to be taken. But he's acquiring self-knowledge and his days of gratuitous long-range sorties and suicide attacks are coming to an end.Tour de France Official Guide, 2002 Chavanel rode his first Tour de France at 22, finishing 65th, later coming third in the Tour de l'Avenir behind Denis Menchov and Florent Brard. In 2002 he won the Four Days of Dunkirk and finished third in the Tour of Belgium. He later won both of those races in 2005. =Cofidis (2005–2008)= On 25 July 2008 Chavanel won the 19th stage of the Tour de France by outsprinting Jérémy Roy at Montluçon. That and other performances brought him election as the most combative rider of the race. On 3 September 2008, he came second in the individual time trial stage of the Vuelta a España at Ciudad Real. His ride brought him to second place overall, two seconds slower than the American, Levi Leipheimer. His team worked for him next day from Ciudad Real to Toledo to make sure he won time bonuses offered along the route. The six seconds he collected were enough to give him the leader's jersey on 4 September. =Quick Step (2009–2013)= Chavanel said in 2007 that he had had offers from foreign teams but was discouraged from joining them because he was unsure of his pension payments outside France. In July 2008 he said he had agreed with Patrick Lefevere the directeur sportif to join the team in Belgium for 2009. Chavanel said he made his decision to move after riding well in classic races in Belgium at the start of the year.Chavanel part chez Quick Step, L'Équipe, France, 27 July 2008 He won Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Brabantse Pijl. He said: :I had other options as well. Professionally, it's an experience that can only do me good. I had the chance to sign for three years with AG2R-La Mondiale but I had the feeling that I wasn't going to develop enough. I have always raced in France and, in my heart, some experience abroad has excited me for some time. I therefore decided to take the step and Patrick Lefévère's advances completely persuaded me. During the 2010 Tour de France, Chavanel took over the yellow jersey after attacking at the mark on stage 2. Following a series of crashes affecting the General Classification contenders on the descent into Spa, the race was neutralized for every rider except Chavanel, who was the lone escapee at that time. He capitalized on that, opening up enough of a gap to win the stage and capture the yellow jersey from Fabian Cancellara (). The following stage was not so good for Chavanel as two punctures on the cobbled roads meant Fabian Cancellara re-took the yellow jersey, however on the Tour's first mountain stage from Tournus to Station des Rousses Chavanel bridged the gap to an early breakaway and rode away to take a famous win and inherit the yellow jersey for the second time. In the 2011 Vuelta a España Chavanel held the red leader's jersey for four stages. On stage three, as part of a breakaway, he finished second behind Pablo Lastras which left him second in general classification, 20 seconds behind Lastras. However, on the next stage Chavanel finished just 57 seconds behind the stage winner while Lastras lost over 18 minutes, thereby making Chavanel the overall leader of the Vuelta. He held this jersey until stage 8 where it was taken by Joaquim Rodríguez. 2012 Olympics time trial in London In 2012, Chavanel won the Three Days of De Panne and won the French National Time Trial Championships for the fourth time. In 2013, after strong appearances in the Tour de San Luis and the Volta ao Algarve, Chavanel won stage six of Paris–Nice, taking the points classification at the race. Chavanel also won the overall classification at the Three Days of De Panne for the second year in a row, winning the final time trial stage. After five years with the team, Chavanel left the squad at the end of the 2013 season, and joined for the 2014 season. =IAM (2014–2015)= After winning the National Time trial title, Chavanel went on to win the 2014 Tour du Poitou-Charentes thanks to a great performance in the stage 4 time trial. A couple of days later, Chavanel topped a very successful week as he prevailed in the World Tour race GP Ouest-France by winning the sprint out of a small group ahead of Arthur Vichot. In 2015 he also accomplished the impressive feat of starting and finishing each Grand Tour. =Direct Énergie (2016–2018)= In September 2015 announced that Chavanel would join them for the 2016 season. In 2018, Chavanel participated in the Tour de France for the 18th time to take the record outright from Stuart O'Grady and Jens Voigt for the most Tour de France participations and was given the most combative rider award for the second stage. On 26 July 2018, Chavanel finished Stage 18 of the race to become the man with the biggest number of stages completed - overtaking Joop Zoetemelk's 365. 3 days later, he tied Zoetemelk's record of finishing the Tour de France 16 times. On the last day of the race, 29 July, he announced he would retire after Tour de Vendée on 6 October 2018. He extended his career to the following week's Chrono des Nations before retiring. Nickname Chavanel is known as Chava, Mimosa or Mimo, after a French film character he imitates. In the Dutch-speaking Belgian media, he is often nicknamed 'La Machine' for his outstanding stamina and determination.

Rawlins is an African-American private investigator, a hard-boiled detective and World War II veteran living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. He is featured in a series of best-selling mysteries set from the 1940s to the 1960s. The mysteries combine traditional conventions of detective fiction with descriptions of racial inequities and social injustice experienced by African Americans and other persons of color in the Los Angeles of that period and the present. While Rawlins is clearly in the tradition of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer, he differs sharply from these earlier fictional detectives in that Rawlins is an unlicensed private investigator (though he acquires a license late in the series) with no background or training in law enforcement. Mosley has written fourteen novels, and a collection of short stories, starring Rawlins, his most popular character. Mosley once stated he intended to bring the character into contemporary times, but later said the 2007 novel Blonde Faith, which is set in 1967, would be the last. Six years later, a new Easy Rawlins novel entitled Little Green was published. Character biography Easy Rawlins was born on November 3, 1920, in New Iberia, Louisiana. His mother died when he was eight years old; soon afterward his father fled to escape lynching after fighting with a white man. The fight was the result of a dispute with his father's supervisor over earnings. Easy had accompanied his father to his job at the slaughterhouse and saw his father argue with the man. When the man called his father the N-word his father punched him. After the scuffle Easy and his father ran off, with his father kissing Easy one last time, and telling him to go home. Easy never found out what became of him. Easy's older half-brother and half-sister went to live with cousins in El Paso while Easy was taken in by his mother's brother-in-law, a violent man named Skyles. After a few weeks, Easy ran away from Skyles's farm and spent the rest of his childhood and adolescence living on his own in the Fifth Ward of Houston, Texas. After accompanying his friend Raymond (\\"Mouse\\") to Pariah, which resulted in the death of Mouse's stepfather, Easy decided to leave Houston to move to Dallas, Texas. He lived there a short while before enlisting in the armed forces. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army, fighting in North Africa, Italy, and finally, the Battle of the Bulge under George S. Patton and Omar Bradley; after the war, he moved to Los Angeles where he purchased his first home and worked at an aircraft assembly plant. Easy got into his own dispute with his supervisor at the Champion aircraft assembly plant. He was asked to stay behind after his shift, but felt tired, and did not trust his ability to check his work. Easy was fired for not remaining to complete the work. Concerns about his unemployment and mortgage payments influenced him to take up his first case as an amateur private investigator. Portrayals The character was played by Denzel Washington in Easy's first and (as of 2020) only on-screen appearance, the 1995 film adaptation of Devil in a Blue Dress. Clarke Peters played Rawlins in a BBC radio dramatization of Black Betty. Over the years there have been several announcements of Easy Rawlins projects that have failed to reach production. On June 7, 2006, it was announced that HBO Films had acquired the rights to Mosley's 2004 novel Little Scarlet for a feature starring Jeffrey Wright as Easy, and rapper/actor Mos Def as Mouse. On September 13, 2011, NBC announced it was developing an Easy Rawlins project. In June 2012 Mosley told the Los Angeles Times that NBC passed on his script. In December 2016, filmmaker Josh Boone announced that he was adapting the series for a television series on FX. Bibliography = Devil in a Blue Dress, 1990 = Set in 1948, Devil in a Blue Dress introduces Easy Rawlins, a newly unemployed factory worker, let go from his job building aircraft because his white supervisor found him \\"uppity\\". Needing money to pay his mortgage, Easy agrees to search for Daphne Monet, the missing mistress of a wealthy white politician. No one is willing to tell Easy just why so many people want to find Daphne, and the trail leads him through the intersection of crime, corruption, and race politics in Los Angeles. In the course of the search Easy reunites with a childhood friend, Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander, a charming but conscienceless stone-cold killer, recently arrived in LA from Houston. The events of the book set Easy on his new career as a trader in outside-the-law \\"favors\\". The book was adapted into a 1995 film of the same name, which starred Denzel Washington as Easy Rawlins, and also featured Jennifer Beals, Tom Sizemore, Maury Chaykin, and Don Cheadle as the unhinged \\"Mouse\\". = A Red Death, 1991 = Set in 1953. With the money he made in Devil in a Blue Dress, Easy has become a landlord. He owns several apartment buildings in Los Angeles, running them through a hired front man while he works as the buildings' handyman and janitor. As the book opens, Easy is audited by the IRS, a problem because he cannot account for how he came to own his property in the first place (because the money with which he bought his first building was stolen). Darryl T. Craxton, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offers to get him out of trouble with the IRS on the condition that Easy investigate an espionage problem at a major aircraft manufacturer. Craxton also wants to prove that labor union organizer Chaim Wenzler is a communist spy. Easy reluctantly agrees, and the job brings him into conflict with several old friends and his own conscience. = White Butterfly, 1992 = Set in 1956. Easy is married and living in a house in Los Angeles with his wife, their baby daughter, and their adopted son Jesus. A black Los Angeles Police Department detective named Quinten Naylor reluctantly taps Easy to investigate a murder spree: four women have been killed, apparently by a serial killer. Easy resents that the LAPD has only started investigating for real because the fourth victim is white. Easy solves the murders despite pressure from the fourth victim's parents, who don't want it known that their daughter had a child with a black man. = Black Betty, 1994 = Set in 1961. Now divorced, Easy lives in a rented house in LA with his adopted son Jesus and adopted daughter Feather. Easy is pressed for cash because most of his money is tied up in a real estate deal, which he's running through a front because he doesn't want any white investors to know that the primary stakeholder is black. He's approached by a white private detective to help search for a missing black woman, an older woman that Easy once had an adolescent crush on, during his youth in Texas. Needing the money he takes the job, and he tracks the woman into a tangled mire of wills and inheritance and questions of who's really related to whom. At the same time Easy has to rein in his murderous friend Mouse, who has just been released after serving five years in prison for manslaughter; not knowing who called the police on him, Mouse has decided simply to kill everyone who might have done it. Easy manages to sort out the missing-person case and stop Mouse from killing half the neighborhood, but he loses his real-estate investment when his agent sells him out to a group of rich white men. = A Little Yellow Dog, 1996 = Set in November 1963. Easy, concerned for his adopted children's future, has given up his career as an outside-the-law \\"fixer\\" and secured a state job with a pension, working as the supervisor of the janitorial staff at Sojourner Truth Junior High School. One of the teachers at the school turns out to be involved in a heroin-smuggling/theft operation run out of the school property, which leads to several murders; an overzealous rookie detective suspects Easy of being involved, and Easy sets out to solve the murders, break up the ring, and get himself out of trouble. In the course of the job he meets Bonnie Shay, a flight attendant unwillingly involved in smuggling, and they start dating. At the climax Easy's friend Mouse appears to be mortally wounded, but Mouse's wife EttaMae carries him out of the hospital over her shoulder and disappears. = Gone Fishin’, 1997 = Set in 1939. Easy, nineteen years old, joins his friend Mouse on a journey from Houston to Mouse's tiny home town of Pariah to confront Mouse's abusive stepfather Reese, a journey that gives Easy his first encounter with murder. (The plot is described briefly in Devil in a Blue Dress.) The story begins with Mouse asking Easy for a ride to Pariah. At the time Easy lives in a small apartment and is doing gardening work in Houston. Mouse is planning his wedding to Etta Mae, and is in need of money. He decides to get the money from his abusive stepfather Reese Corn. Easy agrees to drive Mouse for 15$ in a car borrowed from a friend. On the drive, Easy and Mouse meet Clifton and Earnestine, who are hitchhiking, with the intent to go to New Orleans. Clifton is on the run after beating up a man in Houston. In the small town of Pariah Easy meets many of the people who made Mouse who he is, including the witch Mamma Jo, her hunchback son Domaque Jr, the Blues musician Sweet William (who may have been Mouses's biological father), and many other colorful characters. Easy becomes jealous of the hunchback Domaque's ability to read and recite the bible. This leads to Easy deciding to learn to read better himself. Easy and Mouse are separate for much of Easy's time there, with Easy getting sick and needing to be healed by Mamma Jo. While recovering Easy sees Clifton again, who has been living outside, on the run from the law. With assistance from Mamma Jo Easy gets better in enough time to try to stop Mouse's plan to bring violence to his stepfather, but the events of this trip haunt him. Following this adventure, he remains in Houston long enough to attend Mouse's wedding as his best man, but the next day he gets on a train to Dallas and leaves Houston behind. Not six months after that Easy enlists in the US Army and fights in World War II. Easy recalls the tale while on leave in Paris. The novel is not strictly speaking a mystery, but rather a Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story. Pariah is also the home of several characters who appear in other Rawlins stories, such as Momma Jo the witch and Sweet William the blues musician. = Bad Boy Brawly Brown, 2002 = Set in early 1964. Three months after the events of A Little Yellow Dog, Easy is haunted by grief and guilt over the apparent shooting death of his friend Mouse, and without closure since Mouse's wife took his body from the hospital and disappeared, so Easy clings to an ephemeral hope that Mouse might not be dead. Bonnie Shay has moved in with Easy and his children. Easy's old friend John asks him to look for his stepson, Brawly Brown, a young man in his early twenties, hugely strong but immature, who has left home after an argument with his mother. Easy goes to a meeting of the First Men, a black power group Brawly belongs to; the police raid the meeting, and though Easy escapes out the back, he now finds himself under investigation by covert federal agents; he also discovers that some of the more militant First Men, including Brawly, are involved in arms dealing and planning a payroll robbery. After nearly passing out when running for his life from an ambush, Easy decides to give up smoking. = Six Easy Pieces, 2003 = Set in late 1964. Nearly a year after his friend Mouse's apparent death, Easy is determined to find out if Mouse is alive, or, if not, where his grave is. The seven short stories in the book are connected by the threads of Easy's search for news of Mouse and his own growing dissatisfaction with the predictability of his workaday life as a head custodian. Easy looks into cases of arson, missing persons, and murder, and we learn he has formed a relationship of wary mutual respect with Sergeant Andre Brown, a black LAPD officer, and that Momma Jo the witch (last seen in Gone Fishin' ) has moved to the LA area from Texas. Easy is unsettled by his girlfriend Bonnie's acquaintance with African princes and civil rights activists and other people who are working to change the world; perhaps in response, he rents an office and takes steps toward setting up his own investigation business. = Little Scarlet, 2004 = Set in August 1965. In the aftermath of the Watts Riots, a white detective named Melvin Suggs seeks out Easy at his office. Suggs tells Easy he wants him to investigate the murder of a black woman named Nola Payne, whose nickname was \\"little Scarlet\\" because of her reddish hair. Nola had taken in a white driver who was fleeing from a carjacking; she was found strangled and shot in her apartment, and both her aunt and the police suspect the driver. The LAPD has kept the murder out of the news, and the deputy commissioner asks Easy to find the driver without triggering another outburst of violence. Easy agrees, but he refuses payment for the pleasure of standing up to the police. = Cinnamon Kiss, 2005 = Set in April 1966. Easy is now a legitimate private investigator, the city of LA having given him a license in recognition of the work he did in Little Scarlet. As the book opens, Easy takes a leave of absence from his job as a head custodian in the LAUSD, because he is desperate to find money for the treatment of his daughter Feather, who has a life-threatening blood infection. He seriously considers joining his friend Mouse in a payroll robbery in Texas, but his old friend and fellow detective Saul Lynx brings him a high-paying job. On behalf of an eccentric private investigator named Robert E. Lee, Easy sets out to find Philomena \\"Cinnamon\\" Cargill, the black assistant of a white public-aid lawyer who has gone missing after discovering proof that his family's law firm had secret dealings with the Nazis during World War II. The case takes him to Haight-Ashbury and Easy has his first encounter with the counterculture. = Blonde Faith, 2007 = Set in February 1967. Easy has not returned to his job at Sojourner Truth Junior High School, instead doing detective work full-time. He and Bonnie Shay have separated, and he remains living with his now 11-year-old daughter Feather, who has recovered from her illness. His son Jesus now lives in Venice with his girlfriend Benita and baby daughter Essie. Easy returns home one day to find that his friend Christmas Black, a former Green Beret, has left his eight-year-old daughter in Easy's care. Knowing this means Christmas is in trouble, Easy investigates and comes up against former servicemen who smuggled drugs in Vietnam; this soon leads to his needing to clear his childhood friend Mouse of murder. The novel ends with a car crash, with Easy's fate unresolved, because the author hadn't decided whether he wanted to write another Rawlins novel.\\" A famed detective reaches the end,\\" CNN, November 16, 2007. = Little Green, 2013 = Set in April 1967. Two months after his car crash at the end of Blonde Faith, Easy wakens from a semi-coma. His friend Mouse asks him to find a young man named Evander Noon, whom Mouse calls \\"Little Green\\"; Evander was unknowingly given LSD at a party and wandered off and disappeared during his subsequent hallucinations. Easy's search sends him into the heart of the LA counterculture, where he takes stock of how much America has changed since his own youth. He finds Evander, but also finds trouble. Evander has no memory of his acid trip, but he came out of it covered in someone else's blood and holding a big bag of money, also covered in blood. Easy must sort out what happened, while also defending his friend Jackson from extortion and preventing trouble between Evander and Mouse, and at the same time recovering from his injuries and trying to reconnect with Bonnie Shay. = Rose Gold, 2014 = Set in July 1967. Three months after the events of Little Green, Easy has bought a new house in West LA. As he is moving in, a senior LAPD officer asks him to take on a case: college student Rosemary Goldsmith has gone missing from her dorm at UC Santa Barbara, and a man has called her wealthy father demanding a large ransom...but the father suspects his leftist daughter may actually be trying to take the money he makes from manufacturing napalm and give it to revolutionary causes. The police suspect a black former boxer named Mantle, who has also gone missing, and they put pressure on Easy to investigate, including sending city inspectors to demand large-scale renovations on Easy's real estate holdings, which will cost more money than he has. Easy, though growing doubtful of his own effectiveness as a private eye, takes the case. Mantle, calling himself Uhuru Nolicé, is a revolutionary, and while investigating him Easy runs afoul of the FBI and the US State Department, both of whom seem to be targeting Mantle with false charges; Easy must find out what really happened while avoiding threats from law enforcement and also helping his friends Melvin and EttaMae with their own problems.\\"Rose Gold\\", Random House. = Charcoal Joe, 2016 = Set in May 1968. Easy has formed a partnership with fellow detectives Saul Lynx and “Whisper” Natly, and moved his office from Watts to West LA. His son Jesus has moved to Alaska with his wife and daughter to work in the fishing industry; his daughter Feather is now attending a private high school, the fees paid with the money Easy made in Rose Gold, while Easy prepares to propose to his girlfriend Bonnie. Easy's friend Mouse asks him to take a case on behalf of \\"Charcoal Joe\\", a crime boss currently serving a jail term. The LA police have pinned a double murder on a young black physicist named Braithwaite, and Joe wants Easy to clear him. The case sets Easy following a trail of bodies in the wake of missing Mafia money.

It is best known as the former Citadel Green because The Citadel occupied the arsenal from 1843 until 1922, when the Citadel moved to the city's west side. Marion Square was named in honor of Francis Marion. In this 1865 photo of the original Citadel building, a remnant of the city's defensive wall, known as a horn work, is visible in the foreground; the horn work is still in place in 2014 surrounded by a low iron fence. The square is bounded by Calhoun (south), Meeting (east), Tobacco (a pedestrian only right-of-way that lies between the square and properties to the north) and King (west) Streets. The land is what remains from a parcel conveyed to the colony of South Carolina in 1758. When Joseph Wragg died, his son, John Wragg, received 79 acres along King Street. In 1758, John Wragg sold 8.75 acres to the provincial government for 1,230 pounds for use in the construction of a defensive wall to keep the city safe from Indians and, later, the British. By 1783, there was no longer a need for the defense works, and the 8.75 acres were transferred to the newly created city government. In 1789, the state reacquired a portion of the land along the northern edge to build a tobacco inspection complex. When John Wragg's estate was being administered, an error was discovered; it seems that when the 8.75 acres was acquired by the city, an extra 1.40 acres was also taken over to compensate for the portion of the 8.75 acres which had become used as roads. A petition was submitted to the South Carolina Senate by John Wragg's heirs, and the matter was taken up by a Senate committee in December 1800. The state opted to pay the heirs for the 1.40 acres that had been mistakenly taken beyond the original 8.75 acres; returning the land was impractical since the tobacco complex had already been built by the time the error was discovered. The square is jointly owned by the Washington Light Infantry and the Sumter Guards.The Joint Board of Officers of the Washington Light Infantry and the Sumter Guards, 287 Meeting Street, Charleston, SC Their objections prevented city officials from paving the park as a parking lot in the 1940s and in 1956 and also prevented its development as a shopping center. It is operated as a public park under a lease by the city of Charleston. Under the terms of the lease, the center of the square is kept open as a parade ground.Charleston Business Journal, Article on Revitalization of Marion Square, November 9, 1998, Accessed June 30, 2007. Marion Square is situated directly across from the historic Citadel Square Baptist Church and the South Carolina State Arsenal (Old Citadel). The space is a favorite place for College of Charleston students because of its proximity to campus. In 2003, city council member Wendell Gaillard proposed banning sun-bathing in Marion Square (\\"This 'Girls- Gone-Wild'-type attitude has caught ahold all across the country. We don't want it to get to that point . . .,\\" Gaillard said), but his proposal was met with little support; Gaillard claimed that exposing churchgoers and families to sunbathing was wrong and that sun-bathing students might attract stalkers to the area. In this 1892 photograph of Marion Square, the original version of the Calhoun Memorial can be seen. The square is the home to many monuments, including a Holocaust memorial, an obelisk dedicated to Wade Hampton, and a statue of John C. Calhoun in cast bronze atop a giant pillar. The Calhoun monument is the second such structure in the square. The first one was not liked by the people of Charleston, and the organizers of the installation had problems with the delivery of the pieces. Eventually, in 1894, a new artist, J. Massey Rhind, was commissioned to create a new figure. A new memorial was raised in 1896, and the old one was sold off for scrap value. Controversy again arose in 2017 over Calhoun's views on slavery. In June 2020, the statue of Calhoun was removed by City Council in the wake of widespread protests against racism. In 1944, a bandstand in the Art Moderne style was built according to plans by Augustus Constantine. The structure had originally been planned to house restroom facilities for white servicemen, but a bandstand component was added to the plans. The bandstand became a spot for political rallies, but the restrooms were a constant problem because of vandals. The bandstand was ultimately razed during a refurbishing of the park that began in August 2000 and concluded in 2001. The bandstand had been in very poor shape since at least 1961 when city council approved its removal. During the summer the square is also the home to a farmers market on Saturdays and various festivals such as the Food and Wine Festival and the Spoleto Arts Festival. Since 1913 a tree has been placed in Marion Square for the Christmas season. References Marion Square historical marker for the Siege of Charleston. The center of the defensive works was called the hornwork, the inner wall consisting of a two foot thick wall constructed of lime and oyster shells. Two ditches were in front of the wall, and 93 cannon were mounted along the works. * * External links *Historic Charleston's Religious and Community Buildings, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Category:Parks in Charleston, South Carolina ","title":"Marion Square"},{"id":"2349270","text":"Cocktail sauce is one of several types of cold or room temperature sauces often served as part of a dish referred to as a seafood cocktail or as a condiment with other seafoods.Professional Cooking, College Version - Wayne Gisslen - Google Books The sauce, and the dish for which it is named, are often credited to British celebrity chef Fanny Cradock, but seafood cocktails predate her 1967 recipe by some years (for example, Constance Spry published a seafood cocktail using Dublin Bay Prawns in 1956). Origin shrimp cocktail served with cocktail sauce Seafood cocktails originated in the 19th century in the United States, usually made with oyster or shrimp. Seafood with spiced, cold sauces were a well-established part of the 20th century culinary repertoire. While cocktail sauce is most associated with the prawn cocktail, it can be served with any shellfish. Varieties =North America= In the United States and Canada it generally consists of, at a minimum, ketchup or chili sauce mixed with prepared horseradish. Lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce are common additives, often all three.Frank Stitt's Southern Table - Frank Stitt, Christopher Hirsheimer - Google Books Some restaurants use chili sauce, a spicier tomato-based sauce in place of the ketchup. =Elsewhere= The common form of cocktail sauce in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland, France, Belgium, Italy and The Netherlands, usually consists of mayonnaise mixed with a tomato sauce to the same pink colour as prawns, producing a result that could be compared to fry sauce. It is similar to Thousand Island dressing, but the more usual British name is Marie (or Mary) Rose Sauce. The origins of the name are unclear and it is variously credited to a 1980s dive team cook working at the site of the Tudor ship, the Mary Rose, and Fanny Cradock. However, the term first appeared in the 1920s as a term for a garnish of shrimp, and was in use for cocktail sauce by at least 1963. The name was linked to the colour and Escoffier uses it to describe a pink iced pudding. It was so ubiquitous in the 1960s and 1970s that it has since become something of a joke in Britain, along with its most commonly associated dish, the prawn cocktail. In Belgium, a dash of whisky is often added to the sauce. It is popularly served with steamed shrimp and seafood on the half shell. In Australia, it is often provided in fish and chip shops. In oyster bars In most American oyster bars, cocktail sauce is the standard accompaniment for raw oysters and patrons at an oyster bar expect to be able to mix their own. The standard ingredients (in roughly decreasing proportion) are ketchup, horseradish, hot sauce (e.g., Tabasco, Louisiana, or Crystal), Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice. A soufflé cup is usually set in the middle of the platter of oysters along with a cocktail fork and a lemon slice. Often, the bottles of ketchup and other sauces are grouped together in stations every couple of feet along the counter, but in some oyster bars, patrons are served with their own ingredients.

The Observer was founded in 1886. As of 2020, it has the second largest circulation of any newspaper in the Carolinas. It is owned by The McClatchy Company. Overview The Observer primarily serves Charlotte and Mecklenburg County and the surrounding counties of Iredell, Cabarrus, Union, Lancaster, York, Gaston, Catawba, and Lincoln. Home delivery service in outlying counties has declined in recent years, with delivery times growing later as the paper has outsourced circulation services outside the primary Charlotte area. Circulation at The Charlotte Observer has been declining for many years. The period of May 2011 showed that Charlotte Observer circulation totaled 155,497 daily and 212,318 Sunday. 2017 Print Circulation Daily: 69,987 and Sunday: 106,434. The newspaper has an online presence and its staff also oversees a NASCAR news website, and a corresponding syndicated feature, That's Racin'. The paper's television partner is WBTV. The Observer offices also include editors and designers that makeup the McClatchy NewsDesk-East, which is responsible for the production of The Charlotte Observer and McClatchy newspapers from across the region. From 1927 to 2016, The Charlotte Observer was headquartered at 600 South Tryon Street. The facility included editorial offices, management offices, advertising offices, production, plus a large printing facility with a tunnel and underground railway system to feed paper to the presses. In 2016, the editorial offices moved to the NASCAR building on South Caldwell Street. The old facility was demolished and redeveloped into office space. History The paper was founded in 1886 as the Charlotte Chronicle. The Chronicle was sold to Joseph Caldwell in 1892, and began appearing as the Charlotte Daily Observer on March 13, 1982. It was purchased by Knight Newspapers in 1955. Knight merged with Ridder Publications to form Knight Ridder in 1974. The Observer eventually became the fourth-largest newspaper in the Knight Ridder chain (behind The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, Detroit Free Press and Miami Herald). In 1959, The Observer purchased The Charlotte News, Charlotte's afternoon newspaper. All operations were merged except editorial content, which was fused in 1983. The Observer ended circulation of the afternoon News in 1985. McClatchy purchased most of Knight Ridder's newspapers, including The Observer, in 2006. This made The Observer a sister publication of the state's largest paper, The News and Observer of Raleigh; and of The Herald of Rock Hill, the primary newspaper for the South Carolina side of the metro area. As of spring 2008, it is the fifth-largest newspaper in the McClatchy chain (behind The Kansas City Star, Miami Herald, Sacramento Bee and Fort Worth Star-Telegram). McClatchy's share value has been in decline since the purchase. The stock has lost over 95% of its value, far worse than many remaining newspaper companies. On March 7, 2020, the Observer made the Saturday edition digital only.

The English translation was published in a single volume with the other Noon universe stories Space Mowgli and The Kid from Hell.  Plot summary  The novel tells a story of two young men from Earth, Anton and Vadim, who decide to go for a trip to Pandora, but are persuaded rather to travel to an uncharted planet by a mysterious man whom they know as Saul Repnin. Their choice is an unnamed planet in EN-7031 system, because that's where Gorbovsky and Bader predicted that Wanderers' traces could be found. After landing successfully on the planet (which they named Saula after Repnin), the explorers soon discover a local human civilization, as well as the predicted Wanderers' traces. The latter appear as a phenomenon later called \\"everlasting machines\\" and largely influence the entire local population. Despite the fact that it is strictly forbidden for them to initiate a contact with any human or alien civilization without an authorization from COMCON, they try to do just this - and fail, having misinterpreted the situation. What Anton and Vadim (who lived in Anarcho- communism) see as catastrophic is just a routine life in an early feudalistic society of Saula. Saul Repnin, who, as it was later uncovered, was from 20th- century Earth (a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp, but originally in drafts he was a Soviet political prisoner) but shifted into the future (s.c. time guest), is so shocked to see a local civilization (even though it is not the Earth's one) commit just the same cruelties he saw in his time, that it causes a severe psychological crisis in him. Anton and Vadim decide that it's the best to leave the planet immediately. On arriving back to Earth, they discover that Saul has disappeared, leaving a short note, which partly explains who he was and that he wants to go back to continue his fight against the Nazis (he is armed with a guard's machine-gun). Saul Repnin was killed in a firefight soon after he returned to his time.  Sources  * Strugatsky, Arkady and Boris. Escape Attempt (Best of Soviet Science Fiction) translated by Roger DeGaris.

Under several names, the firm operated from 1839 until 1990. History =Origins= In 1839, Moses Woodruff Dodd (1813–1899) and John S. Taylor, at that time a leading publisher in New York, formed the company of Taylor and Dodd as a publisher of religious books. In 1840 Dodd bought out Taylor and renamed the company as M.W. Dodd. Frank Howard Dodd (1844–1916) joined his father in business in 1859 and became increasingly involved in the publishing company's operation. With the retirement of founder Moses Dodd in 1870, control passed to his son Frank Howard Dodd, who joined in partnership with his cousin Edward S. Mead (1847–1894), and the company was reorganized as Dodd and Mead. In 1876, Bleecker Van Wagenen became a member of the firm and the name was changed to Dodd, Mead and Company.Lilly Library Manuscript Collections, Indiana University (retrieved January 25, 2011)Tebbel, John, Between Covers: The Rise and Transformation of Book Publishing in America.

As head of Dodd, Mead and Company, Frank Dodd established The Bookman in 1895, and The New International Encyclopedia in 1902. He was president of the American Publishers Association for a number of years. The firm built the Dodd Mead Building (1910) at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Thirtieth Street, and the 11-story building was heralded as creating a new trade center in New York City.\\"Frank H. Dodd Dies\\"; The New York Times, January 11, 1916. \\"Fourth Avenue's Newest Improvement\\"; The New York Times, May 9, 1909 Dodd, Mead and Company published the work of new poets including Robert W.

Dodd, succeeded him as president.Tebbel, John, Between Covers: The Rise and Transformation of Book Publishing in America. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987, page 114 In 1922 Dodd, Mead and Company began a period of great expansion with the purchase of the American branch of John Lane Company, publisher of Anatole France, William John Locke and many prominent poets. Other authors included Aubrey Beardsley, Max Beerbohm, Rupert Brooke, G. K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie, Theodore Dreiser, and Stephen Leacock. In 1924 Dodd purchased Moffat, Yard & Co., adding books by William James, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung to their list. Dodd, Mead's New International Encyclopedia was sold in 1931 to Funk & Wagnalls. In 1934, Dodd, Mead acquired Duffield and Green, publisher of Elinor Glyn, Emma Gelders Sterne, and General Krasnov; and the Sears Publishing Company.

He played Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1999–2010. Matthews is the son of the 1973 Rookie of the Year, 1979 All-Star, and former Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Gary Matthews. Career =Early career= Matthews began his career with the San Diego Padres in 1999 and has also played for the Brisbane Bandits of the Australian Baseball League,Flintoff and Dunn Alamanac Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was traded by the Mets to the Orioles for John Bale on April 3, 2002.\\"Orioles acquire Gary Matthews Jr.\\", Baltimore Orioles press release, Wednesday April 3, 2002 Up until 2006, Matthews was not a big figure in baseball, getting only 2,167 at bats over his first seven years (1999–2005). During that time, he hit 59 home runs, stole 54 bases, batted .249 and had a .397 slugging percentage. =2006 season= Matthews batting for the Texas Rangers in 2005 Matthews got off to a fine start in the 2006 season, and as a result he was chosen to play in the 2006 All-Star Game. He and his father were the 14th father-son combination to appear in an All-Star Game, as his father took part in the 1979 game. Matthews is known for his jumping skills and flair for the dramatic in the field, often taking away what would be home runs in the process. His home run-stealing catch against Mike Lamb on July 1, 2006 was so outstanding, Lamb himself applauded after the play. Team radio announcer Eric Nadel said it was the best catch he's ever seen a Rangers outfielder make in his 26 years with the ballclub. It was later called the #1 defensive play ever performed by The Best Damn Sports Show Period. On September 13 of the same year, Matthews hit for a natural cycle in a game against the Detroit Tigers, with a single for his first hit, a double for his second, a triple for his third, and a home run for his fourth. After his fine performance in 2006, with 19 HRs, 79 RBIs, and 194 hits (including 44 doubles), and respected defensive work in the outfield, he was signed by the Angels to a 5-year contract worth $50 million. Many baseball writers such as ESPN's Rob Neyer have called it one of the worst contracts of all time, citing that Matthews' prior performance was never good enough to deserve it and that his subsequent drop-off should have been predictable to the Angels. =Human growth hormone controversy= On February 27, 2007, the Times Union, an Albany, New York newspaper, reported an investigation regarding a steroid ring that involved more than two dozen doctors, pharmacists and business owners who have been, or will be, arrested in Alabama, Texas, Florida and New York. The investigation uncovered evidence that testosterone and other performance-enhancing drugs were purchased by current and former MLB players, NFL players, college athletes, high school coaches, a former Mr. Olympia champion and another leading contender in the bodybuilding competition. One of the baseball players named was Gary Matthews Jr. The evidence listed led to Matthews being named in the Mitchell Report. As a result of being naming in the report, he was given the derogatory nickname Gary Matthews Juicer. In coordination with the team's wish that Matthews make a statement on the matter, he denied using HGH. The Angels had reportedly threatened to void Matthew's five-year, $50 million contract if he did not give a response to the allegations. If he in fact took human growth hormone (HGH) prior to its addition to Major League Baseball's \\"banned substances list\\" in 2005, then he would be \\"grandfathered in\\", therefore resulting in no punishment but a stern warning, if anything, never to use HGH or any other substance banned by MLB in an attempt to further enhance his playing abilities. =2008 season= Matthews with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2008 Matthews had 8 home runs and batted .242 for the 2008 season. =2009 season= On July 10, 2009 he got his 1,000th hit against Joba Chamberlain of the New York Yankees in the second inning. Matthews was the last hitter of the Angels 2009 season, striking out against Mariano Rivera to end game six of the 2009 American League Championship Series. =2009–2010 offseason and trade to Mets= After the end of the season, Matthews went public with his desire to be traded to another team in spite of having two years left on his contract. \\"I don't expect to be back; it's time to move on\\", Matthews said. \\"I'm ready to play for an organization that wants me to play every day. This organization has other plans, and that's OK.\\" The OC Register's Sam Miller doubted Matthews could find a job with another team, comparing him to other aging player with similar attributes. While calling Matthews' contract the sixth biggest franchise-killer, SI.com said the trade outlook for Matthew was not good. \\"The Angels are reportedly shopping Matthews, but it's hard to imagine any takers unless L.A. eats most or all of his remaining salary.\\" On January 22, 2010, Matthews was traded to the New York Mets for relief pitcher Brian Stokes. The Angels picked up $21.5 of the $23.5 million left on Matthews' contract. The trade was met with widespread surprise. Buster Olney, writing for espn.com, wrote the Mets were \\"seeing something in him that other teams are not seeing.\\" Quoting an anonymous talent evaluator for a Major League team, \\"Matthews is a player to be avoided. Slow bat. Declining range. And above all else, a player who wants to be a regular and will be an unhappy distraction in your clubhouse when he's not in the lineup every day\\", while another executive called the move 'baffling.' Fangraphs' Matthew Carruth called the trade \\"close to a wash\\" while Rob Neyer of ESPN.com said \\"One might argue that the Mets just gave up something for less than nothing.\\" With regular center fielder Carlos Beltrán out after having undergone surgery, Matthews was the starting center fielder for the Mets on opening day. On June 4, Matthews was designated for assignment after batting .190 in 58 ABs. On June 15 Matthews was released by the Mets. He signed a minor-league contract by the Cincinnati Reds on June 23. He was assigned to Triple-A Louisville, where he hit .313/.359/.490. However, he was not promoted to the majors, and on July 24, he opted out of his contract with the Reds and became a free agent.

The other highway was the Uttarapatha or the great northern road that ran from Taxila in Pakisthan, through the modern Punjab up to the western coast of Yamuna. Following the course of Yamuna it went southwards up to Mathura, from there it passed on to Ujjain in Malwa and to Broach on western coast. According to \\"Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography\\" by Sanjeev Sanyal, the trajectory of the northern road has remained roughly the same from pre-Mauryan times and is now NH2. However, the southern road appears to have drifted. Rama's route into exile in the epic may have been an early version of the road, but by the time of Buddha it started at Varanasi and ran through Vidisha in central India, to Pratishthana (Paithan). It probably extended all the way to Chola, Chera and Pandya kingdoms of the extreme south. By the Mauryan period there would have been a branch from Ujjain to the ports of Gujarat. This made Ujjain a major city by Gupta times. Today Dakshinapatha is known as NH7, which runs much further east of the old road but still meets NH2 at Varanasi.

He is a right-handed relief pitcher. During his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, Sánchez pitched for Arizona Diamondbacks, Pittsburgh Pirates, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and San Diego Padres. He is known for his distinctive sports goggles he wears while pitching. Career Sánchez was born October 14, 1979 in Cotuí, Dominican Republic. In 1996, Sánchez graduated from Francisco E.

On June 14, 2002, he made his major league debut, pitching a scoreless inning against the Detroit Tigers. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Three weeks later, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitcher Mike Fetters. In 2003, he spent most of the season with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. In 2002 and 2003, Sánchez made 15 appearances with one win and a 12.75 ERA. =Los Angeles Dodgers= After the 2003 season, he was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers.http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20031120&content;_id=606510&vkey;=news_la&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=la In 2004, he began to achieve success, working 80 innings in 67 games with a 3.38 ERA. In August 2005, he became the Dodgers temporary closer, earning eight saves while Éric Gagné remained on the disabled list. =New York Mets= In January 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers traded Sánchez to the New York Mets along with Steve Schmoll in exchange for Jae Weong Seo and Tim Hamulack. Sánchez started 2006 by throwing 18 scoreless innings in 15 games while setting up for Mets closer Billy Wagner. In the early morning hours on July 30, 2006, less than 24 hours prior to the 2006 trading deadline, Sanchez was injured in a taxicab accident in Miami, Florida on Interstate 95; the accident was caused by a drunk driver. Sanchez suffered a separated shoulder, and was flown to New York City to undergo season-ending surgery. The Mets front office learned about the full extent of the injury early on the morning of the trading deadline, but suppressed what had transpired until a trade had been made with the Pittsburgh Pirates that saw the Mets re-acquiring fellow relief pitcher Roberto Hernández, and starting pitcher Óliver Pérez. In January 2007, Sanchez and the Mets agreed to a one-year, $850,000 contract for the 2007 season. Towards the end of Spring training in March 2007, Sanchez suffered a hairline fracture to a small bone (known as the coracoid) in the front of his shoulder. Although the injury was thought to be unrelated to the first injury caused during the taxicab accident, the accident likely weakened parts of the shoulder and the bone cracked when he started throwing again. Sanchez missed the entire 2007 season as a result of the fracture. Sanchez was released by the Mets during Spring Training 2009.

He was born at Cairnsmore House, Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire the son of Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford and his wife Mary Du Caurroy Tribe, DBE, RRC, FLS, the aviator and ornithologist.Obituary:Duchess Of Bedford The Times (London, England), Monday, 29 March 1937; pg. 12; Issue 47644 He was noted for both his career as a naturalist and for his involvement in far-right politics. Early life Educated at Eton College, Russell graduated from Balliol College, Oxford with a Master of Arts (M.A.). He gained the rank of Lieutenant in the 10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, but never fought in the First World War owing to ill health. Naturalism A keen naturalist, Russell arranged a 1906 expedition to Shaanxi, China to collect zoological specimens for the British Museum, during which Arthur de Carle Sowerby discovered a new species of jerboa. He was also closely involved in his father's ultimately successful efforts to preserve the Père David's deer, a Chinese species that was close to extinction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also an ornithologist, specialising in parrots and budgerigars, to whom he would feed chocolates, although his eldest son was often reduced to eating them; his other pets included a spider to whom, according to Nancy Mitford's The English Aristocracy, he would regularly feed roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. While known as the Marquess of Tavistock, he wrote \\"Parrots and Parrot-like Birds\\". He was a founder member and first President of the Foreign Bird League. He was successful in breeding many species, including the Tahiti Blue Lorikeet and Ultramarine Lorikeet. Both of these are recognised as the world's first breedings in captivity. The Marquess disposed of his birds upon succeeding to the Dukedom in 1939. Politics =Pre-war activity= Russell was active in politics for much of his life. In his youth he flirted with socialism and even communism but soon abandoned these in favour of Social Credit, establishing his own National Credit Association to promote the ideology.Dorril, p. 205 He addressed the membership of the New Party about Social Credit but the scheme was not taken up by the group. He was also a leading figure in the Economic Reform Club.Griffiths, p.351 He admired the growing fascist movements in Europe and, despite his devotion to pacifism, wrote in the New English Weekly in support of the Anschluss in 1938.Griffiths, p. 295 Russell was a founder of the British People's Party (BPP) in 1939Thurlow, p. 172 and used his money to bankroll the group from then on.Beckett, p. 157 The driving force behind the BPP was John Beckett, a former Labour Member of Parliament who had also been a member of the British Union of Fascists and the National Socialist League. According to his son Francis Beckett, John Beckett had little real devotion to the unassuming and uncharismatic Russell but was attracted to the BPP as much by the Marquess' money as any real conviction, Beckett himself being virtually penniless at the time.Beckett, pp. 158–159 =During the war= Russell was friendly with Barry Domvile, the founder of the LinkThurlow, p. 180 and had been close to that semi-clandestine group since its establishment in 1937.Dorril, p. 424 In the early months of the Second World War he attended several meetings of leading figures on the far right that Domvile had organised, although he was largely unenthusiastic about this initiative.Thurlow, p. 181 Russell chaired the British Council for Christian Settlement in Europe, established immediately after the declaration of war and featuring an eclectic melange of fascists, fascist sympathisers and committed pacifists.Beckett, p. 160-161 He was a committed pacifist across the board, rejecting war entirely, in contrast to Beckett and several other leading members of the group who were opposed specifically to war with Nazi Germany rather than to war as a concept.Beckett, p. 170 During the early days of the war, Russell was also courted by the British Union of Fascists (BUF), who had changed their name to the British Union, and held meetings with Neil Francis Hawkins, the group's Director-General.Thurlow, p. 185 He had earlier been a sometime member of the January Club, a BUF-linked discussion group.Pugh, p. 146 He had grown close to BUF member Robert Gordon-Canning, and under his influence even came to write for the BUF's newspaper Action.Dorril, p. 482 Nonetheless, in private BUF leader Oswald Mosley dismissed Russell as \\"woolly- headed\\".Dorril, p. 484 At the start of 1940 he corresponded with the Home Secretary Sir John Anderson after obtaining a document from the German legation in Dublin that Russell claimed contained Adolf Hitler's draft proposals for peace. Following the obtaining of this document by Russell, on 13 March 1940 Domvile organised a meeting for both men, Mosley and Imperial Fascist League (IFL) veteran Bertie Mills to discuss their next course of action. At this meeting Mosley proposed the creation of a \\"Peace Government\\" to be led by David Lloyd George, although nothing more came of this initiative as the government soon launched a crackdown on far-right activity.Thurlow, p. 182 A number of leading figures were interned under Defence Regulation 18B although Russell was not among their number.Thurlow, p. 223 Russell's nobility helped to ensure that he avoided arrestBeckett, p. 167 along with other far- right leaning noblemen such as the Lord Lymington, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Duke of Westminster, the Earl of Mar, Lord Brocket, Lord Queenborough and others.Pugh, p. 306 His personal links to Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also helped to ensure his freedom.Pugh, p. 307 He wrote a series of letter to Halifax in the early days of the war expressing his admiration for Hitler and urging him to use his influence to bring the war to a swift conclusion.Griffiths, p. 372 Russell was, however, placed on the \\"Suspect List\\" by MI5 as some within that group suspected that, in the event of a successful Nazi invasion of the UK, Russell might have ended up as Governor of the territory or even Prime Minister of a puppet government.Dorril, p. 515 Beckett however was among those held, and Russell attempted to intervene on his behalf, assisting Beckett's common-law wife Anne Cutmore in a letter- writing campaign to secure his release.Beckett, p. 184 When Beckett was released Cutmore again asked Russell, by then Duke of Bedford, for help as they were penniless and he agreed to allow them to live in a cottage in the village of Chenies, at the time entirely owned by the Duchy.Beckett, p. 186 He would continue to underwrite the Becketts until his death in 1953, even purchasing a large house in Rickmansworth for the family's use in 1949.Beckett, p. 191 =Post-war= Russell re-established the BPP in 1945, the group having been in abeyance during the latter years of wartime.Macklin, p. 123 Party activity was fairly limited and frequently restricted to irregular party functions hosted at the Becketts' house in Rickmansworth.Beckett, p. 192 Increasingly associated with the anti-Semitism espoused by leading BPP figures, Russell stated that the figure of six million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust was \\"grossly exaggerated\\" and argued that a figure of 300,000 concentration camp deaths, drawn from all those interned rather than just Jews, was more likely.Macklin, p. 124 He also denied that any concentration camp had a gas chamber, claiming they were just showers. He also funded the publication of Failure at Nuremberg, a pamphlet authored by the \\"BPP Research Department\\" (effectively Beckett, A.K. Chesterton and former IFL member Harold Lockwood) which denounced the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis as a series of show trials that started from the basis of presumed guilt on the part of the defendants. Unusually he also contributed articles on Social Credit and pacifism to anarchist Guy Aldred's journal, The Word, between 1940 and his death.Caldwell, John Taylor (1988), Come Dungeons Dark: The Life and Times of Guy Aldred, Glasgow Anarchist, p.234. Personal life In November 1914, he married Louisa Crommelin Roberta Jowitt Whitwel; the couple had three children: *John Ian Robert Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford (1917–2002), who supplied a detailed and hostile portrait of him in the 1959 memoir A Silver- Plated Spoon; *Lady Daphne Crommelin Russell (2 September 1920 – 1 June 1991); *Lord Hugh Hastings Russell (1923–2005), a conscientious objector in the Second World War, married Rosemary Markby and had issue. Russell was a committed Evangelical Christian and vegetarian. An austere man who detested alcohol, tobacco and gambling, he was even sued by his wife in the 1930s for \\"restoration of conjugal rights\\" after the pair became estranged. The case was dismissed after much press coverage with his wife's description of him as \\"the most cold, mean and conceited person\\" she had ever known being widely reported.Beckett, pp. 194–195 Following his death the sentiments were largely echoed by his eldest son – who shared none of his father's political views and had a difficult relationship with him – who stated \\"my father was the loneliest man I ever knew, incapable of giving or receiving love, utterly self-centred and opinionated. He loved birds, animals, peace, monetary reform, the park and religion. He also had a wife and three children\\".Beckett, p. 194 Russell put his 11-acre estate, the Chateau Malet in Cap-d'Ail near Monaco for sale through Knight, Frank & Rutley in 1921. =Death= Russell died in 1953, aged 64, as a result of a gunshot wound in the grounds of his Endsleigh estate in Devon. The coroner recorded his death as accidentally inflicted, but his elder son suggested it may have been deliberately self-inflicted.

The film stars Jimmy Sheirgill, Minissha Lamba (in her film debut) and Yashpal Sharma in lead roles and had its theatrical release on 29 July 2005. Yahaan was also screened at the 7th Ocean's Cinefan Film Festival where it was awarded with the Special Jury Prize. Plot Kashmir is in turmoil because of terrorists trying to take over the land and the Indian army trying to find and eliminate them. Army commander Aman meets Adaa when posted to Kashmir to fight the insurgents. Adaa lives with her father, grandmother and a mute adopted sister. Adaa's brother Shakeel has joined hands with the terrorists to gain a free Kashmir. Circumstances soon lead to Aman and Adaa falling in love. Aman does not let the army know about his new relationship. He is given the task of finding and eliminating terrorists; he captures their leader, who happens to be Shakeel's mentor. Adaa's family learns about her affair with Aman. Her grandmother approves of the relationship, but her father requests Aman to stay away from them, as their love will not be approved in that place. A disappointed Aman is then given another mission. Acting on a tip, he and his men go to raid a terrorist hideout but are attacked by the terrorists. Many insurgents are killed, and Aman and four comrades are taken captive by Shakeel. They demand the release of their leader from the government in exchange for the soldiers. But Adaa finds her brother's hideout, goes there, and pleads with him not to harm Aman. Using the opportunity, Aman breaks free and escapes with Adaa, just as the army besieges the place and rescues the captured army men. Now Aman and Adaa's affair becomes known to the army. Suspicion falls on Aman that he is in cahoots with the terrorists, as he is not at their hideout, and he has run off with Adaa. As soon as he arrives in the city, he is arrested and court- martialed. Adaa does all she can to help Aman. She goes to the chief minister, who agrees to help her but on the condition that she deny any relationship with Aman in public, as it can affect the reputation of the army. Adaa does not agree to that. Instead, on the advice of her mute sister, writes a letter to the prime minister, telling him her story and seeking help for Aman. As fate would have it, she is called by a TV channel for a live interview and to tell her story to the world. This news spreads, and the terrorists are irked. They advise Shakeel to put an end to it all: He takes over a mosque, holding people hostage in exchange for their leader and Adaa's silence. They also bomb Adaa's house (at their leader's orders), injuring her grandmother gravely. Adaa decides to broadcast her story live, no matter what. Shakeel demands from the government that he negotiate with the man who had a relationship with his sister: Aman. In the climax, Aman enters the mosque alone and faces Shakeel. Shakeel beats him black and blue, then sees that his father is one of the hostages in the mosque. At the same time, Adaa tells her story live on TV. Everyone listens to the heart-wrenching tale of the two lovers and a plea for Shakeel to return. Aman tells Shakeel that the terrorist leader had bombed Shakeel's house and his grandmother is in hospital. The terrorists then decide to leave, holding a man and a few hostages as guard. As soon as they step out, pre-planned by Aman who is wearing a bulletproof jacket, a sniper commando shoots him. He falls from the impact, thus giving the sniper a chance to aim at other terrorists. The army invades and forces the other terrorists to surrender. In the end, Adaa arrives and they leave the scene together.

Aakash Gandhi of Planet Bollywood praised the soundtrack and gave it a rating of 8.5 out of 10 in his music review. Response Yahaan was released along with director Kabir Kaushik's Sehar on 29 July 2005. However, due to heavy rains in Mumbai on 26 July 2005, both the movies performed poorly at box office. Critics praised the film for being warm and intimate. =Critical reception= Anupama Chopra of India Today praised the acting performance of Jimmy Shergill and the direction of Shoojit Sircar but criticized the slow pacing of the film and it's climax which she felt was unconvincing. Raja Sen of Rediff appreciated the realistic nature of the film along with the acting performances of all actors but was critical of the film's \\"oversimplified\\" conclusion. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised the performances of Jimmy Shergill and debutant Minissha Lamba but felt that the film suffers from a weak screenplay and slow pacing. Taran gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5. Alok Kumar of Planet Bollywood praised the acting performances of the lead actors and the cinematography of the film and gave the film a rating of 9 out of 10 saying that \\"Yahaan is moving and original\\".

The film is based on the teachings of Estus Pirkle and warns of the dangers facing the United States from Communist infiltrators. The film suggests that the only way to avoid such a fate is to turn to Christianity. It has attracted something of a cult following among secular fans because of its explicit depictions of torture and mass murder and the heavy-handed nature of its evangelical message. The title paraphrases : > If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out, Then how can you > compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace, How will you do in > the thicket of the Jordan? The movie was sampled by the sound collage band Negativland. Pirkle's narrative includes an imagined visit to the United States under Communism where loudspeakers in internment camps issue proclamations such as \\"Christianity is stupid, Communism is good, give up!\\" ad infinitum. Negativland lifted the phrases and played them repeatedly backed by industrial music and various other sound effects into the song \\"Christianity Is Stupid\\". A more complete version of Pirkle's narrative can be heard on Negativland's Helter Stupid.

History and profile Founded in 1982, the magazine was originally called PC World, and was one of the earliest technology magazines published in India. In 1992, the magazine was renamed to PC Quest (now PCQuest, without the space). In 1993, PCQuest began focusing more on actual users, carrying instructional and descriptive articles that enabled users to familiarize themselves with the technologies described. Today the magazine covers three aspects of IT technologies, products and implementation of solutions, with the focus being on the implementations  PCQ Online BBS  In 1994, PCQuest launched India's first attempt by an Indian publication to create an online, interactive service for its readers, by setting up a BBS. With the proliferation of Internet access as of 1996, this service moved to the web.  PCQ Labs  To support its own sister publications, as well as external entities requiring such services, PCQuest formed PCQ Labs in 1994. The charter of PCQ Labs was to do technology and product reviews, investigate new technologies, and document them for readers. The labs has since been renamed to Cybermedia Labs.  PCQ Cover CD/DVD  In 1995, PCQuest became the first Indian publication to carry a Cover CD - a CD- ROM that carried supplementary information, software and other material. With permission from IBM, the first cover CD carried a fully functional copy of OS/2 Warp 4. Today the magazine carries a Dual Layer DVD every month.  PCQ Linux Initiative  In March 1996, PCQuest launched its PCQuest Linux Initiative. The initiative included the publication of an annual Linux distribution on the cover CD as well as technical articles about Linux and other Open Source technologies. This has resulted in the distribution of close to a million Linux CD-ROMS in India since 1996. For many people in India, this became the primary source of Linux distributions. Since 2001, the initiative has been called PCQLinux, which is not entirely correct, as the name only refers to the customized Linux distribution on the CD, not the initiative to promote and support Open Source technologies. The last PCQLinux was published in 2009 after a user poll concluded not much use of CD to urban users, as the broadband access improved and also other ways of getting CD became available. PCQuest has published \\"Linux Specials\\" every year since 1996, except in 1997 and 2001, when it published two such special issues.  Content  PCQuest initially did not retain dedicated writing staff. In late 1992, then-editor Prasanto Kumar Roy initiated a new approach, by sourcing much of PCQuest's content from technology industry writers, contributors and enthusiasts. Over the years, these writers included names such as Atul Chitnis, Kishore Bhargava, Ashish Gulhati, Rishab Aiyer Ghosh, Vipul Ved Prakash, Vinod Unny, Krishna Kumar, Varun Jaitly and others. Subsequently, PCQuest built up the first magazine owned test and review facility for IT products in India. Today, most of the content is created by a team of in-house technology analysts.  Video  In 2005 PCQuest started experimenting with producing a video on technologies and products that was carried in the cover mounted CD/DVD. In 2006, this became a regular feature of about 25–30 minutes that is carried every month.

Reverend Maurice F. McCrackin was removed from his church St. Barnabas in Cincinnati's West End, for standing up for his beliefs being against the Vietnam War. Not paying his federal taxes during those years was for the same reasons, since those taxes were going towards the war effort. After his very large church, St. Barnabas, was taken away by Presbyterian hierarchy, he started the small Community Church. Many of his former parishioners followed him to the small building on Dayton Street in Cincinnati where he preached, ran services, baptized babies, and performed weddings and funerals. He was a principled pacifist all of his life. He was active in the struggle for racial equality and an end to militarism in the United States. McCrackin was well known to the state's attorneys office as he was arrested over and over again in protests. Rev. McCrackin was also active in the fight for prisoner's rights and spent much time visiting convicts. Once, he was abducted by a man that he had visited in jail and rather than see him incarcerated again, refused to testify against him.

It was built in 1907 to facilitate the rescue of shipwrecked survivors along the coast, part of the treacherous Graveyard of the Pacific. It is now part of the Pacific Rim National Park and is often rated by hiking guides as one of the world's top hiking trails. The West Coast Trail is open from May 1 until September 30 by reservation only. History A view of the Pacific coast from the West Coast Trail The West Coast Trail passes through the traditional territory of the Pacheedaht, Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, and Nuu-chah- nulth peoples, who have inhabited the area for more than 4,000 years. Native trails, used for trade and travel, existed in the area before European settlement. In the 1800s, Europeans began to use the area to build and maintain a telegraph line between Victoria and Cape Beale. As well, more and more ships began to travel past the west coast of Vancouver Island, particularly between San Francisco and Alaska. The reefs and breakers off the coast posed a serious danger to navigation. One source cites almost 500 shipwrecks around Vancouver Island alone, part of a series of Pacific Northwest wrecks that led the region to be nicknamed the Graveyard of the Pacific At the start of the 20th century, very little lifesaving infrastructure existed on the sparsely populated island. Although some plans were already underway to improve the infrastructure, the public outcry that followed the wreck of the SS Valencia in January 1906 spurred the Canadian government to undertake a comprehensive plan for improvements. The plan included: * The construction of a new lighthouse at Pachena Point ( south of Bamfield), near where the Valencia had run aground. * The introduction of wireless telegraphy on the BC coast through the construction of five wireless stations at Pachena Point, Estevan Point (where a lighthouse was added in 1910), Cape Lazo (near Comox, on the eastern coast of the island), Point Grey (in Vancouver), and Gonzales Hill (in Victoria). Among these, only Pachena Point is located on the Dominion Lifesaving Trail. Each station was initially expected to have a range of about , hence their spacing.Stratham, Frank, West Coast Maritime Coast Station Centenary Canadian Coast Guard Association Newsletter, Winter 2008 The introduction of wireless service led to the rapid adoption of this technology by vessels plying the coastal trade. * The construction of shelters at intervals on the trail. Each shelter had a telegraph with instructions for use in several languages, survival provisions like blankets and rations, and directions on navigating the trail. * Establishment of the Bamfield Lifeboat Station. In 1908, the station was equipped with a state-of-the-art motor lifeboat built to a United States Lifesaving Service specification by the Electric Launch Company (Elco) of Bayonne, New Jersey. it was the world's first purpose-built motor lifeboat , and over the next half-century hundreds of similar boats would be constructed for lifesaving stations in the US and Canada. The trail allowed shipwreck survivors and rescuers to travel the forest making use of the telegraph line and cabins. In 1973 the trail became part of Pacific Rim National Park and has been continuously upgraded. The current trail passes through numerous Indigenous Reserves (Pacheedaht: Gordon River #2 & Cullite #3; Ditidaht: Carmanah #6, Claoose #4, Wyah #3 & Tsuquanah #2; Huu-ay-aht: Masit #13). In the 1970s, a lack of regulation resulted in hikers trespassing on culturally important and environmentally sensitive First Nations archaeological sites, such as villages and refuges on Reserve lands. As a result of this trespass on the traditional territory and cultural property of First Nations living in the area, hikers are now required to remain on the trail when passing through any Reserve areas. To accommodate the growing interest in off-trail historical sites, the Ditidaht First Nation now offers guided adventure tours through their traditional lands. Canadian Coast Guard Station Bamfield is still in operation and now hosts the CCG's Rigid Hull Inflatable Operator Training School. Description Tsusiat Falls, a major campground on the trail The trail starts at Bamfield near Barkley Sound and runs south to Port Renfrew on Port San Juan Bay. In 1902, Bamfield became the North America terminus of the All Red Line's Pacific submarine cable, which spanned the globe linking the British Empire. A trail was constructed to carry the line south to Victoria (and thence across Canada to link up with the Transatlantic telegraph cable at Heart's Content, Newfoundland), as well as providing telegraph service to the lighthouses at Cape Beale (on Barkley Sound) and Carmanah Point ( north of Port Renfrew, at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca). Hikers can choose to begin the trail in Port Renfrew and travel north, or in Bamfield and travel south. The southern parts of the trail are far more challenging than the flatter area in the north. Overnight hikers must buy a permit, as only a set number of people are allowed to be on the trail at any one time. However, individuals are permitted to visit during the day at no expense. Colourful intertidal rock formations at Owen Point The trail itself winds through forests, bogs, slippery moss-covered ladders, climbing, rappelling and beach treks. Hikers have a choice in parts of the trail to stay in the highlands, which is much boggier, or try to make progress on the beach, which is slow, but easier on the feet. The trail passes old growth trees, waterfalls, streams and thick patches of deep mud. Along the coast, the trail includes sand and pebble beaches, headlands, and exposed shelf and boulders at low tide. The trail often diverts inland to avoid dangerous surge channels and impassable headlands, where cliffs descend straight into the sea even at low tide. Portions of the beach sections can be made impassable by high tides. Tide tables and maps are issued by Parks Canada staff to all hikers prior to starting the trek. In some inland areas the trail consists of a boardwalk, which can be in disrepair and covered with moss and mud. One of many ladder series on the trail The main designated campgrounds along the way feature bear boxes for safe storage of food, an outhouse, and a view of the Pacific Ocean and Olympic Peninsula when the sea fog is not present. This fog offers a unique perspective as the beach and sky are clear, while the view just off shore is blocked. There are also numerous smaller campsites along the trail, with varying amenities, which can offer a quieter experience away from the often crowded main campsites. As 30 people may start the trail from each direction each day, it is not unusual to find many groups of hikers spending the night at any given main campsite. Waterfall on the Darling River The trail is still extremely rugged and requires a high level of fitness, knowledge, and skill to complete, although in the last 10 to 15 years it has been upgraded to facilitate easier hiking and safety for those with less experience. This has changed the nature and challenge of the trail somewhat but has made it easier for hikers to explore the coast. It has been recommended that hikers travel in groups as a measure of safety, but some also hike the trail solo. To cross the larger rivers and streams hikers must ride cable car suspensions, while smaller or slower waterways are bridged only by fallen logs or may even require wading. There are two waterways that require a boat to cross: the Gordon River, at the southern trailhead, and the Nitinat Narrows, near the midpoint of the trail. A ferry service is operated by the local First Nation. The trail includes some three dozen ladder structures, some of them high, that hikers must ascend or descend. Hikers usually take an average of 7 days to complete the trip, allowing visitors to stop at some point for a day, although it has been run in a single day. Approximately 6000 backpackers complete the trail every year, with 1-2% requiring emergency evacuation due to injury, illness, or hypothermia. There are two locations on the trail where food can be bought: 1) the ferry operator, Doug, at Nitinat Narrows at km 32 (mile 20) has fresh seafood, a choice between salmon and crabs, baked potatoes and corn; 2) Chez Monique's on the beach, just south of the Carmanah Lighthouse, sells a variety of burgers (beef, salmon, cod, halibut and egg+veggie). Both locations also sell soft drinks. Other than these two locations, hikers must be entirely self-sufficient and prepared for the back country conditions of the trail. Hiking the West Coast Trail is a major attraction for adventure seekers coming to British Columbia to experience the Pacific Northwest's scenery, wildlife, culture, and weather. The West Coast Trail remains one of the most famous trails in Canada. Transportation services are available at both ends of the trail via Trail Bus or float plane. Hikers who do not wish to complete the trail can also take a water taxi at Nitinat Narrows to the other end of Nitinat Lake, but this is a time-consuming process as the taxi will normally only transport hikers who wish to leave the trail after 5:00 pm as it is used before then to allow hikers to cross from north to south or the reverse and land travel is slow and tedious. The distance of the trail, whilst officially listed at 75km, has not been changed or updated by Parks Canada for many years after being re-routed numerous times. Trail distance also changes depending on beach or forest travel, and some distance markers repeat themselves. GPS tracks from various hikers have put the true distance between 80km and 92km. https://www.strava.com/activities/644118060 https://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-North_America/countries- Canada/trails-West_Coast_Trail https://happiestoutdoors.ca/guide-to-the-west- coast-trail/ https://www.facebook.com/groups/231026500765453/permalink/538173680050732/ Wildlife Wildlife that can be encountered include cougars, black bears, wolves, hummingbirds, orcas, gray whales, seals, sea lions, and eagles. There are also abundant tidal pools on the beach portions, where hikers can see a variety of molluscs, sea anemones, and fish. Hikers are told how to react to possible encounters with dangerous animals (cougars, bears, and wolves) at the mandatory orientation session prior to starting the trail. During certain times of the year, there is the possibility of encountering seal pups on the beach. The pups should not be approached, as the mother may then abandon the pup. All wildlife on the trail should only be viewed from a safe distance. Winter 2006/2007 damage In January 2007, it was revealed that intense storms during the previous weeks had severely damaged the trail. The full extent of the damage was not initially known, but an estimated 3,000 trees had been downed, a bridge and cable car were destroyed, and a serious landslide at kilometre 12 (mile 7) was discovered. In March, C$500,000 in extra funding from the federal government was announced to assist with the cleanup. The trail now features many rebuilt walkways, ladders, and bridges replacing those that were destroyed by the storm. However, as structures deteriorate quickly in the wet coastal conditions, fallen trees and slippery boardwalk are still commonly encountered.

Around 1797 he moved to Edinburgh, where he served as clerk and book-keeper to several firms, he joined the Philomathic Debating Society, where he made the acquaintance of John Ritchie and William Ritchie. He established the Scotsman, 26 January 1817, with William Ritchie and John M'Diarmid, and was joint editor of the first few numbers. When he obtained a position as a clerk in the custom house, he yielded the editorial chair to John Ramsay M'Culloch. In 1820, Maclaren resumed the editorship and held it till 1846, when he resigned it to Alexander Russel. The paper rapidly became the leading political journal of Scotland; its tone was throughout decidedly whiggish, and in church matters it advocated much freedom of opinion. In 1822 Maclaren was the first person to successfully identify the correct position of the lost city of Troy, in his Dissertation on the Topography of the Plain of Troy. In the 1830s Charles Maclaren of the Scotsman newspaper is listed as living at 58 George Square on the south side of the city. The property is a double level flat over 57 George Square. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1837. His proposer was Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. In 1846 he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London (FGS), and he was President of the Edinburgh Geological Society from 1864 to his death. He died at Moreland Cottage on Grange Loan,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1865-66 Edinburgh, 10 September 1866. He was interred at the Grange Cemetery. His monument is a large Celtic cross facing the north path. Publications *Dissertation on the Topography of the Plain of Troy *The Geology of Fife and the Lothians In 1820, Archibald Constable employed Maclaren to edit the sixth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, (1823) and to revise the historical and geographical articles. McLaren contributed the articles 'America,' 'Europe,' 'Greece,' 'Physical Geography,' and 'Troy'. His Selected Works (1869) were edited by Robert Cox and James Nicol.

He was a member of the European Parliament from 2014 until 2018. He was the leader of the Congress of the New Right (KNP), which was formed in 2011 from Liberty and Lawfulness, which he led from its formation in 2009, and the Real Politics Union (Unia Polityki Realnej), which he led from 1990 to 1997 and from 1999 to 2003. Currently, he is the chairman of the party Liberty, which changed its name from KORWiN, and since 2019 he is a member of the Sejm, elected from the electoral list of Confederation Liberty and Independence. Biography From 1962 to 1982 he was a member of the Democratic Party. In 1987 he founded a fringe national conservative, economically liberal political party called Ruch Polityki Realnej (Movement of Real Policy), later renamed - Unia Polityki Realnej (UPR, Union of Real Policy). In 1990 he established a weekly paper Najwyższy Czas! (About Time!). Korwin-Mikke was a member of Parliament during the first term of the Sejm of the Third Republic of Poland. He was the originator of the vetting resolution on 28 May 1992, which obliged the Minister of Internal Affairs to disclose the names of all politicians who according to communist files were cooperating with communists. He was his party's candidate in Polish presidential elections, obtaining 2.4% votes in 1995, 1.43% in 2000, 1,4% in 2005, 2.48% in 2010, 3.3% in 2015. In 2018 he co-founded a eurosceptic political party Konfederacja. In 2019 he was elected for deputy in the lower chamber of Polish Parliament (Sejm). He is a self-declared monarchist who claims that democracy is \\"the most stupid form of government ever conceived\\". He co-authored a book on bridge.Brydż, 1976 (Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Watra)  Controversies  2000 presidential campaign in Poland At the plenary session of the European Parliament held after the assault at Charlie Hebdo, Korwin-Mikke expressed his dissatisfaction with the public reaction to those events by typing at his laptop 'I am not Charlie. I am for death penalty' and presenting it to the public instead of a sign 'Je suis Charlie' held by the other MEPs. Korwin- Mikke during a press conference in the Polish Sejm, 2015 = Sexism = In 2009 he published his guidebook for men, \\"Father's Vademecum\\", in which he wrote many advices that have been recognized as highly controversial and sexist, such as \\"If you cannot resolve conflict with your wife in any way, if you cannot convince her, then, unfortunately, you have to use physical force.\\" He believes that women are, on average, less intelligent than men, citing chess results to back up his claims. Also, he cites Margaret Thatcher as his political model. He also stated that the difference between rape and consensual sex is very subtle, even going as far as saying that \\"Were you to understand woman's nature, sir, you would know that there is an element of rape in every sexual intercourse\\". He further claimed that: \\"there is a hypothesis that the attitudes of men are passed to women they sleep with\\". On 1 March 2017, Korwin-Mikke sparked controversy by stating that women were paid less than their male counterparts on average due to them being \\"smaller, weaker and less intelligent\\", during a debate in the EP regarding the gender pay gap. Two days later, Korwin-Mikke would make further comments stating that there was a stereotype that \\"women have the same intellectual potential as men” and it “must be destroyed because it is not true.” Later he was suspended for 10 days from the plenary sessions of the EP. = Racism = In 2014, Korwin-Mikke was fined by President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz for 'expressing himself in a racist manner'. The decision was taken after Korwin-Mikke's speech about EU employment policy on the plenary session on 16 July, during which he said: 'we have 20 million Europeans who are now negroes of Europe'. According to him the word 'negroes' was not meant as an offence, but rather referred to the song by John Lennon and Yoko Ono 'Woman is the Nigger of the world'. = Ableism = During the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Korwin-Mikke wrote that the general public should \\"not see the disabled on television\\". On the other hand, in 2007 he set up the \\"Individual Development Foundation\\" which helps disabled people develop their skills in chess. = Anti-semitism = Korwin-Mikke has a history of anti-semitic stunts and statements.https://www.timesofisrael.com/far-right-polish-lawmaker-natural- selection-via-pogroms-made-jews-powerful/ Far-right Polish lawmaker: Natural selection via pogroms made Jews powerful He promoted a conspiracy theory on Jews in conjunction with reporting on the residents of Pruchnik beating up the effigy of an Orthodox Jew. In 2020 he stated that anti-Jewish pogroms made Jews powerful via natural selection and that rabbis may have engineered this.https://www.jpost.com/International/Polish-MP-says-Pogroms-were-good-for- Jews-assisted-natural-selection-619640 Polish MP says pogroms were good for Jews, assisted natural selection Korwin-Mikke denies being an anti-Semite. = Other conspiracy theories = Other provocative statements include his claim that there is no written proof that Adolf Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. On 15 April 2015, the Polish news outlet Wiadomości quoted Korwin-Mikke that the snipers that shot civilians and police officers during the Maidan protests were trained in Poland and that they acted on behalf of the CIA to provoke riots. = Criticism of the EU = He proposed that the European Commission's Berlaymont building would be better used as a brothel. In July 2015, Korwin- Mikke was suspended from the EP after giving a Nazi salute and saying \\"ein Reich, ein Volk, ein ticket\\" during a speech to protest against a uniform EU transport ticket. = Criticism of social welfare = In regard to welfare, he claimed that \\"if someone gives money to an unemployed person, he should have his hand cut off because he is destroying the morale of the people\\". On 8 September 2015, Korwin-Mikke was giving a speech in EP about the European migrant crisis, during which he described immigrants unwilling to work and only interested in welfare as \\"human garbage\\". His opinion met with critical reaction of other MEPs. As a result of this, Korwin-Mikke was once more suspended from the EP for 10 days and fined €3062.

The towns streets show the sober architecture of clearly Andalusian extraction. Nevertheless, apart from the influence of the Conquistadors, there is a mixture of the traditions of Portuguese inhabitants and of Guanches, as the pre-Hispanic natives were known, which have helped to make up the particular charm of this district. The people have, due to the scarcity of resources, been characterised by an unquenchable spirit of conservation, which has kept alive traditions such as craftwork in bone, wood, cane and straw from the local forests of the region.webtenerife.co.uk  Geography  = Location = The municipality of Buenavista del Norte is located at the extreme north west point of the island of Tenerife bordering with the municipalities of Los Silos to the east and Santiago del Teide to the south . It is connected with the former by TF42 and with the latter by the spectacular, but curvy route of Masca (at 650 m) TF436. The total surface spanned by the municipality is of 67.42 km², just 3% of the surface of the entire island. The volcanic formation of the Macizo de Teno that emerged over 7 million years ago constitutes the largest section of the territory.  Population Distribution  Most of the population (75%) lives in the capital town located in the lower part of the municipality known as Isla Baja. Most of the remaining inhabitants reside in either El Palmar (9%) at 300–500 m above sea level on TF436 or further along the same road in Las Portelas (6%) at 650 M above sea level. Las Canteras counts another 5.5% of the population, while the remaining locations, Masca, Teo and Los Carrizales are sparsely populated. The villages of Masca, Teno Alto, Los Carrizales, El Palmar, Las Portelas and Las Lagunetas preserve the old agricultural traditions of Canary Islands while in the lower coastal part, the cultivation of bananas dominates.  Flora and Fauna  = Coastal Vegetation = The bioclimatic coastal environment is classified as inframediterranean. thumb The vegetation consists of both native and imported species that have established a symbiotic ecosystem whereby the invasive species may provide protection from human traffic, strong winds or water erosion for the native plant. This is exemplified that the high density growth of Prickly pear cactus and balsam spurge known locally as tabaiba. Both are abundant along the coastal region as close as 30 meters from the ocean, from Punta Teno to the Buenavista Lighthouse close to the border with Los Silos. Also prominent because of its size is Canary Island spurge. Two varieties of Patellifolia, patellaris and procumbens, are often found very close to the shore. Many of its characteristic resemble Tetragonia tetragonoides with which it shares a strong salt tolerance and mode of propagation. A few examples of Kleinia neriifolia can be found close to the basaltic cliffs. It becomes more dominant further inland, abundant on the volcanic dome (with a crater that was converted into a reservoir, known as Embalse Montaña de Taco) south of the Buenavista Lighthouse. A variety of Argyranthemum, (coronopifolium or adauctumSee: http://www.floradecanarias.com/argyranthemum_adauctum.html Flora de Canarias) is abundant, Asparagus pastorianusSee: http://www.floradecanarias.com/asparagus_pastorianus.html Flora de Canarias is the major asparagus variety found along the coastal region. Astydamia latifoliaSee: :es:Astydamia latifolia is easily recognized as a plant of the celery family by is characteristic fragrance similar to angelica. It is important in the seasonal parched to green transformation of the coastal landscape as it loses most its leaves during the dry period that sprout again from a rizome after the first autumn rains. Large bushes of Salsola divaricata See: :es:Salsola divaricata remain predominantly green in the dry season flowering after the rains. Schizogyne sericea is ubiquitous forming large bushes with yellow flowers. Sea fennel recognizable from its distinct smell and grey-green color of its succulent leaves, is found on the basaltic cliffs a few meters from the ocean but seldom inland more that 200 meters. Other common plants are Euphorbia aphylla, Hyoscyamus albus, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Monanthes laxiflora,See: http://www.floradecanarias.com/monanthes_laxiflora.html Nicotiana glauca, Periploca laevigata. Climate Buenavista del Norte has a Mediterranean climate, with most rain falling from October to March. Its exposed northwesterly location allows it to trap most of the moisture condensed by the mountains of Tenerife, so that it receives over three times more rainfall than Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Background and education Russell was the son of Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford, and his wife, Louisa. He had a very strained relationship with his father and grandfather, who during his early years refused to give him the allowance he felt would be appropriate for a future Duke; his father eventually tied up most of the Bedford fortune in trust so that he could not borrow against it.John Russell, A Silver-Plated Spoon (1959).

Personal life Taylor was born as Loretta Helen Cooney in New York City on April 1, 1883, of Irish heritage, to James and Elizabeth (née Dorsey) Cooney. She had a younger sister, Elizabeth.1900 United States Federal Census She married her first husband, Charles Alonzo Taylor (born January 20, 1864, South Hadley, Massachusetts – died March 21, 1942, Glendale, California), on May 1, 1901, aged 18. He was almost two decades her senior. They had two children, Dwight Oliver Taylor (January 1, 1903 – December 31, 1986) and Marguerite Courtney (August 13, 1904 – February 8, 1995), but divorced circa 1910. On December 22, 1912, she married British-born playwright J. Hartley Manners, who wrote the play Peg o' My Heart, a successful play and an enduring personal triumph for Taylor, who toured in it extensively throughout the country. The play's success inspired a 1922 film version starring Taylor and directed by King Vidor. A six-reel print of the film survives in the Motion Picture Division of the Library of Congress. The marriage was successful and Taylor remained married to Manners until his death in 1928. By law, Taylor lost her U.S. citizenship by marrying a foreign national. A widow, Taylor reclaimed by naturalization, on September 11, 1930, her United States citizenship (cert #3234876). Her petition notes her \\"not having acquired any other nationality by affirmative act\\". Stage work Taylor and her husband J. Hartley Manners circa 1914–1915 Taylor made her Broadway debut in The Great John Ganton in 1908 and appeared in other stage productions such as The Ringmaster, Alias Jimmy Valentine, Seven Sisters, Lola Lola, and The Bird of Paradise. Taylor also appeared in other productions, including One Night in Rome, The Wooing of Eve and the special production, Laurette Taylor in Scenes From Shakespeare. In the last production, she performed scenes from Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, and The Taming of the Shrew. According to New York Times theatre critic Brooks Atkinson, it was The Girl in Waiting (1910), which \\"made her a star.\\" Of her acting, he wrote, > By the time she was in her late teens, she had created a highly individual > technique of acting that was spontaneous and eloquent; it consisted of > variations in tempo, tentative movements that were not quite completed, > quizzical glances, absorption in what other actors were saying, and, of > course, a warm, expressive voice that always seemed to be addressed directly > to the individual theatergoer. 'Luminous' was the word most frequently used > about her performances. The effect was so seemingly spontaneous that, early in her career, some doubted she was deliberately acting, as \\"she employed none of the ritualistic mannerisms or extravagances of the conventional acting of her day.\\" In 1945, Taylor was voted the best actress in a Variety magazine poll. Her biggest hit was Peg o' My Heart. A simple Cinderella-formula vehicle written for her by her husband Manners, it ran on Broadway from December 20, 1912, to May 1914, setting a new Broadway dramatic-play run record of 607 performances. The play earned her and her husband about a week, made Taylor \\"the most generally worshiped [theatrical] star of her time\\", and cemented her reputation as a skilled actress. After it closed on Broadway, Taylor starred in the London production until German Zeppelin bombing closed it down in 1915. In 1917, she appeared in Out There, (another vehicle written for her by Manners) playing \\"an obscure Cockney waif\\" who, \\"by patriotism and idealism\\" manages to become a uniformed Red Cross nurse. \\"She relieved the suffering of wounded English soldiers by attending to them professionally and by charming them in person.\\" A line from the play – \\"If I go, will you go?\\" – became the headline of a highly effective armed forces recruiting poster. In 1918, Taylor starred in yet another successful Manners vehicle, Happiness (she would later reprise the role in the 1924 movie of the same name). According to Atkinson, the play version was \\"a sentimental comedy about a Brooklyn errand girl who taught a rich customer the secret of happiness.\\" Soon after, Taylor toured the nation with a revival of Peg o' My Heart, which reopened on Broadway at the Cort Theater on February 14, 1921, and ran for another 692 performances. However, by the 1920s, public taste had become more sophisticated. Taylor had always starred in the kind of simple, formulaic plays which had delighted pre-World War I middle-class audiences, and her popularity waned. New York Times theatre critic John Corbin wrote that she \\"had probably the greatest talent, the highest spirit of our times\\", but that her dated material held her back. Attempting to change her course, Manners then wrote a serious play for her, The National Anthem, a play with \\"high motives\\" which \\"rebuked and renounced the jazz generation.\\" It opened in 1922 and, unsurprisingly, failed. It was the last time Taylor appeared in a play by her husband. Few of Taylor's performances survive on celluloid. In 1924, Taylor starred in a film version of Happiness, directed by King Vidor, which told of the adventures of a young shopgirl, \\"Jenny Wray\\", who learns that riches do not necessarily lead to happiness. The cast included Hedda Hopper and Pat O'Malley. The same year, Taylor starred in another screen version of Manners' dramatic play, One Night In Rome, in which she played the dual roles of Duchess Mareno/Madame Enigme. Taylor seems to have enjoyed making One Night in Rome as she kept a personal print of the movie to always show guests at her home, running it over and over again. Taylor's friend Noël Coward spent a weekend at her home. He was inspired by that visit to write, in just three days, his comedy of manners Hay Fever (1925). The play, a comedic dissection of a family whose theatrical excesses drive their unsuspecting visitors to distraction, was a major hit from the moment of its August 6, 1925 debut. It also caused a serious and permanent rift in the friendship of Taylor and Coward. She suffered from severe alcoholism for many years, a condition which sharply limited her appearances from the late 1920s throughout her career. In 1938, she headed the cast in a revival of Outward Bound and did not appear again until her re- emergence in Williams' The Glass Menagerie in 1944; her performance received nearly unanimously rapturous reviews and won her the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Actress of the season. Motion pictures Peg o' My Heart (1923) Taylor planned to make her film debut in Peg o' My Heart, but the film version of the hit play was coveted by nearly every screen actress, including Mary Pickford, who made an offer considerably in excess of the highest amount ever paid for the picture rights to a play or a story. The rights to the film were coveted because of the production's established popularity. Almost any actress in the famous role would be assured of a resounding success, however Taylor doggedly clung to the movie rights for her own use, should she ever commit to appearing in a film. It took years for the play to be filmed and released. King Vidor remembered in his autobiography, A Tree Is A Tree: > \\"I soon landed a job at the old Metro studio on Romaine Street – the > assignment: to direct Laurette Taylor in Peg O' My Heart. Although I had > never seen Miss Taylor, her name carried with it a certain magic to my young > ears.\\" The play was considerably expanded for the film version, and the final production was an immediate success with audiences. Taylor went on to make another adaptation of one of her stage successes, Happiness, and then a third and final film for MGM, One Night in Rome. She never appeared in another film, although David O. Selznick did invite her to film a sound test for a role in his 1938 film The Young in Heart, which Taylor did, but she declined the part and actress Minnie Dupree was cast. (The sound film test exists and has been shown on TV from time to time). In preparing interviews for what became Broadway: The Golden Age, Rick McKay kept asking each person \\"Who influenced you the most\\" and time and time again, Laurette Taylor's name was mentioned. McKay ended up devoting an entire section to Taylor, and it includes a section on her 1938 screen test. Approach to acting Taylor wrote an essay on acting, titled \\"The Quality Most Needed\\", which was included in some of the early editions of the text Actors on Acting. In it, Taylor muses on the importance of imagination over physical beauty for the actress wishing to truly create art. She sharply criticizes performances where you can \\"see the acting\\", and warns against paying too much attention to the traditions of acting, saying it \\"cramps creative instinct\\". To Taylor, the imaginative actress will leave you with a feeling that you can imagine her character's conduct \\"[i]n any position, aside from the situations involved in the actions of the play\\". Taylor applauded the imaginative actress who \\"builds a picture, using all her heart and soul and brain\\", not for the audience but for herself.Sheila O'Malley website archive, sheilaomalley.com; accessed July 22, 2016. Death Taylor died from a coronary thrombosis on December 7, 1946, at age 63. Her ashes were interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. Legacy Writing after Taylor's death, Tennessee Williams paid tribute to \\"the great warmth of her heart\\", saying, \\"There was a radiance about her art which I can compare only to the greatest lines of poetry, and which gave me the same shock of revelation as if the air about us had been momentarily broken through by light from some clear space beyond us.\\"Tennessee Williams' tribute to Laurette Taylor, nytimes.com; accessed July 26, 2017. In 1960, the play Laurette, starring Judy Holliday and directed by José Quintero, closed out of town in Philadelphia due to Holliday's battle with breast cancer.\\"Judy Holliday Faces Surgery\\", The New York Times, October 12, 1960, p. 44 For years, film director George Cukor tried unsuccessfully to launch a film version of Taylor's life. In 1963, a musical adaptation of Laurette opened on Broadway. The musical, titled Jennie,Internet Broadway Database: Jennie starred Mary Martin in the title role. Its book, by Arnold Schulman, is credited as having been suggested by Marguerite Courtney's Laurette, and its score was by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz. It ran for only 82 performances, receiving mediocre reviews. A one-act play, Opening Night, appeared briefly off-Broadway in October 1963. Peggy Wood portrayed Fanny Ellis, a once-famous star who is preparing for a performance in her dressing room. Many thought Fanny was actually Taylor. Wood appeared with Ruth Gates. The play ran for only 47 performances. In the 2004 documentary Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There, numerous Broadway veterans cited Taylor's performance in Glass Menagerie and Outward Bound as the most memorable stage performances they had ever seen. A rare sound film clip of Taylor in a screen test made for David O. Selznick's studio is included in the documentary. The test, for a role in the film The Young in Heart, reportedly did not meet the approval of studio executives. = Archive = According to her daughter, Marguerite Courtney, Laurette destroyed all press books, letters, programs, photograph albums, and other memorabilia associated with her life with J. Hartley Manners upon his death in 1928. In 1995 and 2009, the family placed the remainder of her papers at the Harry Ransom Center. The archive includes correspondence, personal and theater photographs, photograph albums, sound recordings, press reviews, articles, and legal documents, as well as writings by others. Elsewhere in the Ransom Center's holdings is Taylor's screen test for David O. Selznick and extensive collections relating to Tennessee Williams. =Notable fans= *Actor/teacher Uta Hagen's highly regarded 1991 acting text A Challenge for the Actor describes Taylor as her \\"idol\\" and \\"an inspiration\\", seeing her as the ultimate example of an actor working from the inside out. Hagen praised Taylor for saying that her identification with a character wasn't complete until she was \\"wearing the underpants of the character\\". Hagen's description of Taylor's acting was that she subjectively developed her actions and words, which \\"always sprang from her as though for the very first time\\".Hagen, Uta 1991. A Challenge for the Actor. New York: Scribner's; *Actor Charles Durning described seeing Taylor's acting: \\"I thought they pulled her off the street.

Life and career Born in the culturally rich town of Kita, west of the Malian capital, Bamako, Djelimady grew up surrounded with traditional music played by members of his family, griots, musicians and historians by birth. Djelimady played djembe drum and ngoni, a banjo-like lute, as a boy. When he moved to Mali's capital, Bamako, during the 1960s, he had actually planned to work as a tailor. But music proved a stronger calling. He started playing guitar in a large, government-sponsored neighborhood band, Orchestre Misira. Voted the best guitarist in the band, Djelimady was selected to join the Orchestre National as rhythm guitarist, a great honor for the young player. All his adult life, Djelimady has worked to transform his ancestral traditions into dance pop. But at the same time, he has continued to work in more traditional contexts, backing the great griot singers of Mali on records, in concerts and at the day-long wedding and baptism celebrations that are the modern griot's life blood. In recent years, Djelimady has performed in an acoustic trio called Bajourou, accompanied by another masterful griot guitarist, Bouba Sacko, and by singer Lafia Diabate, a veteran of the Rail Band. In 2001, he has won the BBC Radio 3 music award in World Music - \\"Africa\\" category for his album titled Sigui.BBC 3 Awards for World Music In 2002, Djelimady collaborated on a track with rapper Common for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot and Riot in tribute to the Nigerian afropop innovator, Fela Kuti.

He has been described as one of the least-known and yet most successful defenders of America's natural heritage. He is considered instrumental to achievements such as the creation of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the creation and later expansion of Redwood National Park and Point Reyes National Seashore, and the expansion of Mount Tamalpais State Park. Biography  He was born on September 17, 1906 in Macon, Georgia. He graduated from University of Georgia in 1926 and from Harvard Medical School in 1930. He moved to San Francisco in 1933 to practice medicine. He joined the Sierra Club in 1939 to participate in a burro trip. After four years in the military in England as a doctor with the Army Air Forces, he returned to San Francisco. He was elected to the executive committee of the local Sierra Club chapter, and formed its first conservation committee. In 1947 he married Peggy Elliott, and together they were involved in some of the key battles of their time to protect wild places so that future generations can explore and enjoy them. In particular, he played a central role in the establishment of Redwoods National Park and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, as well as in the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. President Clinton presents Edgar Wayburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999In 1995, he was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism and in 1999 President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Upon presenting the 1999 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Wayburn, President Clinton said that he had \\"saved more of our wilderness than any other person alive.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote an article commending the award, saying \\"The White House has made a well-informed choice in selecting Wayburn, 92, as a recipient next Wednesday of the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\\" Wayburn published his memoir Your Land and Mine: Evolution of a Conservationist in 2004. Wayburn was honored at a 40th Anniversary Gala Celebration as the recipient of the inaugural Howard C. Zahniser Lifetime Achievement Award, given to someone whose life of achievement in protecting wilderness most closely parallels those of the person principally responsible for the Wilderness Act. Wayburn's gravestoneHe died of natural causes on the evening of March 5, 2010 at the age of 103. At the time he was at his home in San Francisco with his family by his side. He was survived by four children: Cynthia Wayburn, Diana Wayburn, Laurie Wayburn, and William Wayburn. Activism  Wayburn served five terms as the Sierra Club's elected President, and was named the Club's Honorary President in 1993. During a half- century of environmental achievements, Wayburn led and won campaigns to protect millions of acres of America's coasts, mountains, forests and tundra. Wayburn has left his mark in the following ways: * Establishing the nation's largest urban park, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Included in the park's 76,000 acre (310 km²) expanse are San Francisco's beaches, Alcatraz and the Presidio * Protecting over 100 million acres (400,000 km²) of Alaskan wild lands with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which doubled the size of Denali National Park, created 10 new National Parks, and doubled the size of America's National Park system * Creating Redwood National Park, and then doubling the park's size 10 years later; * Increasing the area of California's Mount Tamalpais State Park from 870 to 6,300 acres (3.5 to 25 km²).

Views =History= In his 1990 book, The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy, Sale argued that Christopher Columbus was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a New York Times book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee William Hardy McNeill wrote about Sale: \\"he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded.\\" However, McNeill also declares Sale's work to be \\"unhistorical, in the sense that [it] selects from the often cloudy record of Columbus's actual motives and deeds what suits the researcher's 20th- century purposes.\\" In McNeill's opinion, Columbus' advocates and detractors present a \\"sort of history [that] caricatures the complexity of human reality by turning Columbus into either a bloody ogre or a plaster saint, as the case may be.\\"William H.

Sale has a comprehensive knowledge of what is called the American Songbook (Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, and movie tunes 1910-1960) and was active in the folk revival of the 1960s with Peter Yarrow, Pete Seeger, and the Clancy Brothers, but has said that he does not \\"care much for\\" pop music after that era. For example, \\"he once heard a 'racket' in a nightclub during his left activist days in the 1960s from some 'young man' everyone told him was a 'big deal.' That 'young man' turned out to be Bob Dylan.\\" Kirk recalls that \\"he'd never heard anything so awful in his life.\\" In 1995, Sale agreed to a public bet with Kevin Kelly that by the year 2020, there would be a convergence of three disasters: global currency collapse, significant warfare between rich and poor, and environmental disasters of some significant size. The bet was turned into a claim on the FX prediction market, where the probability has hovered around 25%.FX Claim NLud (Claim NLud - Neo- Luddite K.

He argues that the major theme of contemporary history, from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the expansion of United Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to nations today, is the breakup of great empires. Some on both left and right call for smaller, less powerful government. In 2004, Sale and members of the Second Vermont Republic formed the Middlebury Institute which is dedicated to the study of separatism, secession, and self-determination. Sale is director of the institute. In 2006, Middlebury sponsored the First North American Secessionist Convention, which attracted 40 participants from 16 secessionist organizations and was described as the first gathering of secessionists since the American Civil War. Delegates issued a statement of principles of secession which they presented as the Burlington Declaration.Information on the 2006 secession convention and Burlington Declaration at MiddleburyInstitute.org In October 2007, The New York Times interviewed Sale about the Second North American Secessionist Convention, co-hosted by the Middlebury Institute. Sale told the interviewer, \\"The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well.\\" He went on to say, \\"If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt, inefficient, militaristic, oppressive, repressive, but you don't want to move to Canada or France, what do you do? Well, the way is through secession, where you could stay home and be where you want to be.\\"Information on the 2007 Secession convention at MiddleburyInstitute.org The convention received worldwide media attention.Bill Poovey, Secessionists Meeting in Tennessee, Associated Press, October 3, 2007.Leonard Doyle, Anger over Iraq and Bush prompts calls for secession from the US, The Independent, UK, October 4, 2007., WDEF YouTube Channel, October 3, 2007. The convention's other co- sponsor, the League of the South, has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center since 2000. According to Sale, \\"They call everybody racists. There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center later criticized The New York Times October 2007 Peter Applebombe interview of Sale for not covering its allegations.Mark Potok, New York Times Feature on Sale Left Out a Fact or Two, October 23, 2007.

He was Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland and then in England and was Lord High Treasurer from 1624 to 1628. On 31 December 1624, James I created him Baron Ley, of Ley in the County of Devon, and on 5 February 1626, Charles I created him Earl of Marlborough. Both titles became extinct upon the death of the 4th Earl of Marlborough in 1679. Early life James Ley was the youngest son of the soldier and landowner Henry Ley (died 1574), of Teffont Evias, Wiltshire, where he was born in about 1552.Anthony Wood, Athenae Oxoniensis, vol. 2 (1692), p. 487 online His mother was Dyonisia de St. Mayne, or St. Maure, daughter of Walter St. Maure. He attended both Cambridge and Oxford Universities, graduating from Brasenose College in 1574. He then trained as a barrister, becoming a bencher of Lincolns Inn and reader of Furnival's Inn. Public service Ley was elected as Member of Parliament for Westbury in 1597. In 1603, he was appointed a judge on the Carmarthen circuit. That November he became a serjeant at law and in December James I knighted him: James formed a high opinion of his abilities. He was elected MP for Westbury again in 1604, and then King James sent him to Dublin as Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland. He also served on the Privy Council of Ireland. He was diligent in his official duties, and was the first judge to hold an assize in Wicklow. Amongst other things, he caused the English Book of Common Prayer to be translated into Irish, and sought to enforce Protestant church attendance on the Irish Catholic nobility. As a result he became highly unpopular, and a flood of complaints went back to England concerning the severity of his administration. Ley was called back to England in 1608, ostensibly to brief the English Privy Council on the settlement of Ulster. He was then appointed to the lucrative post of Attorney- General of the Court of Wards. Further promotion came slowly. He was member of Parliament for Westbury again in 1609–1614 and was elected MP for Bath in 1614. He was made a baronet in 1619. In 1621 he was made an English judge at Westminster, when he became Lord Chief Justice. He was elected MP for Westbury again in 1621, but was required to preside in the House of Lords following the disgrace of Francis Bacon, though he was not made Lord Chancellor, despite reportedly offering £10000 for the office. The same year he married as his third wife Jane Boteler, niece of the prime royal favourite Buckingham. Late in 1624, though the influence of Buckingham, Ley replaced Cranfield as Lord High Treasurer, also being sworn as a Privy Councillor. He was created Baron Ley, and then in 1626 Earl of Marlborough. His treasurership was a difficult one due to Charles I's financial difficulties, and his own lack of experience of the world of finance. He retired from this in 1628, and from July 1628 until December 1628 he was Lord President of the Council. However he soon retired to Lincolns Inn and died the following March. He was remembered as a poor statesman but an able and impartial judge. Other achievements Ley was a founder member of the Society of Antiquaries. None of his works on legal or antiquarian subjects were published in his lifetime, but his grandson James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough arranged for the publication of his treatise on wardship in 1642, and a collection of law reports in 1659. Four of his papers to the Society of Antiquaries were published by Thomas Hearne in his Collection of Curious Discourses (1720). Family Ley married firstly Mary Pettie, daughter of John Pettie and Elizabeth Savage, of Stoke Talmage, Oxfordshire, by whom he had three sons and eight daughters, including: *Henry Ley, 2nd Earl of Marlborough *William Ley, 4th Earl of Marlborough *Lady Hester Pulter, the poet *Anne Ley, who married Sir Walter Long of Draycot Cerne, MP He married secondly in 1618 Mary Bowyer, daughter of Thomas Pierson, and widow of Sir William Bowyer; she died only a few months later. He married thirdly Jane Boteler, daughter of John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield and his wife Elizabeth Villiers, half-sister of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, to which connection he owed his later advancement. She remarried William Ashburnham and died in 1672. The Earl's third marriage is said to have caused bitter family quarrels.

In the east, the Bóbr River from Łagoda via Krzystkowice down to the historic town of Żary forms the border with the lands of Lower Silesia. In the west the course of the upper Dahme River down to Golßen separates it from the former Electoral Saxon lands of Saxe-Wittenberg. Between Lower and Upper Lusatia is a hill region called the Grenzwall (literally \\"border dike\\", although it is in fact a morainic ridge), the eastern continuation of the Fläming Heath. In the Middle Ages this area had dense forests, so it represented a major obstacle to civilian and military traffic. Today it is roughly congruent of the border between Brandenburg and the state of Saxony. Recultivation and flooding of a former lignite mine north of Klinge, near Cottbus In the course of much of the 19th and the entire 20th century, Lower Lusatia was shaped by the lignite (brown coal) industry and extensive open-pit mining, by which more than 100 of the region's villages—many of them within the Sorbian settlement area—were damaged or destroyed, especially by order of East German authorities. While this process is still going on, most notably around Jänschwalde Power Station, run by EPH, some now exhausted open-pit mines are being converted into artificial lakes, in the hope of attracting tourism, and the area is now referred to as the Lusatian Lake District (Lausitzer Seenland). Lower Lusatian House of the Estates Assembly in Lübben Today the area comprises the Brandenburg districts of Oberspreewald-Lausitz and Spree-Neiße with the unitary authority of Cottbus, as well as parts of Elbe-Elster, Dahme-Spreewald, and Oder-Spree. Important towns beside Cottbus and the historic capitals Lübben and Luckau include Calau, Doberlug-Kirchhain, Finsterwalde, Forst, Guben/Gubin, Lauchhammer, Lübbenau, Senftenberg, Spremberg, Vetschau, and Żary in present-day Poland. Since 1945, when a small part of Lusatia east of the Oder–Neisse line was incorporated into Poland, Żary has been touted as the capital of Polish Lusatia.STOLICA POLSKICH ŁUŻYC History The area of Lower Lusatia roughly corresponds with the eastern March of Lusatia or Saxon Eastern March between the Saale and Bóbr rivers, which about 965 was severed from the vast Marca Geronis, conquered by the Saxon count Gero in the course of his campaigns against the Polabian Slavs from 939 onwards. Odo I became the first margrave; his successor Gero II from 1002 onwards had to face several attacks by Polish duke Bolesław I Chrobry, which did not end until the 1018 Treaty of Bautzen, which ceded large parts of eastern Lusatia to Poland. Emperor Conrad II reconquered the territories in 1031. Lower (green) and Upper Lusatia (yellow), Johann Homann, early 18th century In 1136 Conrad the Great of the mighty House of Wettin, margrave of Meissen since 1123, also received the March of Lusatia. This remained under the rule of the Wettin dynasty until in 1303 it was acquired by the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. With Brandenburg the march was inherited by the House of Wittelsbach in 1320; in 1367 Elector Otto V sold it to Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg who incorporated Lower Lusatia into the Bohemian Crown. Charles' father King John of Bohemia had already acquired the adjacent territory to the south around Bautzen and Görlitz, which became known as Upper Lusatia. The former Lordship of Cottbus was acquired by Brandenburg in 1455 and remained an exclave within the Bohemian kingdom. Both Lusatias formed separate Bohemian crown lands under the rule of the Luxembourg, Jagiellon and—from 1526—Habsburg dynasties. In the course of the Reformation the vast majority of the population turned Protestant. The Bohemian era came to an end when Emperor Ferdinand II of Habsburg ceded the Lusatias to Elector John George I of Saxony under the 1635 Peace of Prague in return for his support in the Thirty Years' War; thus the lands returned to the House of Wettin. As the Kingdom of Saxony had sided with Napoleon it had to cede Lower Lusatia to Prussia in the 1815 Congress of Vienna, whereafter the territory became part of the Province of Brandenburg. With the implementation of the Oder–Neisse line by the 1945 Potsdam Conference, the lands east of the Neisse river fell to Poland, and the land's indigenous German population was expelled by the Communist Authorities. Coat of arms Coat of arms of Lower Lusatia The Lower Lusatian bull is first documented in 1363. In 1378, upon the death of Emperor Charles IV, it appeared in gules on a field argent (red on silver), similar to the coat of arms of Luckau. In contrast to the Luckau bull, the bull of Lower Lusatia is however not armed. After over 600 years it is still used today as Lower Lusatia's coat of arms.

Some versions of the recipe also include chocolate, coffee or both. Its name, sometimes spelled \\"banoffi\\", is a portmanteau combining the words \\"banana\\" and \\"toffee\\". History Credit for the pie's invention is claimed by Nigel Mackenzie and Ian Dowding, the owner and chef, respectively, of The Hungry Monk Restaurant in Jevington, East Sussex, England.\\"The joys of jam roly-poly, a very British pudding\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 21 February 2018 They claim to have developed the dessert in 1971 by amending an unreliable American recipe for \\"Blum's Coffee Toffee Pie\\" with a soft toffee made by boiling an unopened can of condensed milk for several hours. After trying various changes including the addition of apple or mandarin orange, Mackenzie suggested banana and Dowding later said that \\"straight away we knew we had got it right\\". Mackenzie suggested the name \\"Banoffi Pie\\", and the dish proved so popular with their customers that they \\"couldn't take it off\\" the menu. The recipe was published in The Deeper Secrets of the Hungry Monk in 1974, and reprinted in the 1997 cookbook In Heaven with The Hungry Monk. Dowding has stated that his \\"pet hates are biscuit crumb bases and that horrible cream in aerosols\\". It was Margaret Thatcher's favourite food to cook.The Celebrity Cookbook: Kitchen Secrets of the Rich and Famous; Brooks, Marla (1993) The recipe was adopted by many other restaurants throughout the world. In 1984, a number of supermarkets began selling it as an American pie, leading Nigel Mackenzie to offer a £10,000 prize to anyone who could disprove their claim to be the English inventors. The word \\"Banoffee\\" entered the English language and became used to describe any food or product that tastes or smells of both banana and toffee. A recipe for the pie, using a biscuit crumb base, is often printed on tins of Nestlé's condensed milk, although that recipe calls for the contents of the tin to be boiled with additional butter and sugar instead of boiling the unopened tin – presumably for safety reasons.

Founded in 1990 as Theatre Beyond by Paul Gelineau, the company became The People's Theatre Kingston in 1992 and had two more Artistic Directors under that name—Kathryn MacKay (1993–94) and Kathleen LeRoux (1994–97). In late 1997, Craig Walker, was appointed as artistic director. In early 1998 the company shortened its name to Theatre Kingston and moved into the Baby Grand Studio in downtown Kingston, where it began offering a full season of four or more productions a year. Under the name Theatre Kingston, the company began to gain a reputation not only for the high quality but the unusual nature of its productions. These include two co-productions with the local French theatre company, Les Treteaux de Kingston, of bilingual plays: David Fennario's Balconville and Marianne Ackerman's L'Affaire Tartuffe; the second professional productions of Ann-Marie MacDonald's The Arab's Mouth and Judith Thompson's Perfect Pie; uncommon approaches to more familiar plays: such as Judith Thompson's Lion in the Streets—which was presented in the round on a sand-floor in a setting which resembled a cross between a public park and a bull-ring; an eerie version of Henry James' ghost story, The Turn of the Screw in the adaptation by Jeffrey Hatcher, which took place in a long dark hallway with the two performers—the Governess and a man who played all the other roles—picked out by spots of light; and Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion—which was set as if in the playwright's own study, Shaw himself narrating, dressing the stage, playing the minor characters and filling out the story with short scenes drawn from his own screenplay. The company has also presented several world premieres, including most notably Meltdown, John Lazarus's astonishing retelling of the myth of Daedalus, Icarus and the Minotaur; the collectively created community play about Kingston's social stratification, Princess Street: The Great Divide; Fred Euringer's Night Noises, about a nineteenth- century nutritionist who connived at the starvation deaths of his own children, and Craig Walker's Chantecler, a musical based loosely on the play by Edmond Rostand and his Finnegans Wake: a dream play, an innovative adaptation from the novel by James Joyce which enjoyed a successful run not only in Kingston, but at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto. The Globe and Mail declared this a \\"brilliant\\" production which showed \\"amazing theatrical panache\\". In 2004, Theatre Kingston took Walker's production of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale to Harbourfront in Toronto. EYE Magazine called it a \\"moving and insightful production\\" that \\"ma[de] the work shine like new.\\" In 2001, in association with Queen's University, the company created a children's theatre troupe, The Barefoot Players, which tours the parks and libraries of the Kingston region every summer.

A native of Odemira, he was a pharmacist by profession. He wrote Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de li partiti, published in Rome, Italy, in 1512; it went through eight editions in the sixteenth century. Damiano describes the rules of the game, offers advice on strategy, presents a selection of chess problems (see diagram), and analyzes a few openings. It is the oldest book that definitely states that the square on the right of the row closest to each player must be white. He also offers advice regarding blindfold chess principally focused on the need to master notation based on numbering the squares 1-64 . In this book Damiano suggested chess was invented by Xerxes which would be the reason why it was known in Portuguese as xadrez and in Spanish as ajedrez. In fact, these words come from Sanskrit caturaṅga via Arabic šaṭranj. The well known chess aphorism \\"If you see a good move, try to find a better one\\", sometimes misattributed to Lasker and other writers, can be found in Damiano's book; similar sentiments were expressed by al-Suli regarding Shatranj, the Arabic precursor to chess.Edward Winter, Chess Notes 7837 & 7841 \\"Si hai buon tratto per la mano guarda se ne sia altro megliore\\" Chess openings In his opening analysis, Damiano suggested that after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 the reply 2...Nc6 is best and 2...d6 (now called the Philidor Defence) is not as good. He rightly condemned 2...f6 as clearly inferior, noting that White can play 3.Nxe5 with advantage, however the opening later came to be known as the Damiano Defence. He stated that 1.e4 and 1.d4 are the only good first moves and that 1.e4 is better. He examined the Giuoco Piano, Petrov's Defence, and the Queen's Gambit Accepted.

Life Cavendish was the second son of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, by his first wife Anne Keighley. He was educated by Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher, who lived at Chatsworth as his private tutor for many years. In 1608, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge accompanied by Hobbes. He was knighted at Whitehall in 1609. He then went with Hobbes on a Grand Tour from about 1610, where he visited France and Italy before his coming of age. He was a leader of court society, and an intimate friend of James I, and Hobbes praised his learning in the dedication of his translation of Thucydides. In 1614, Cavendish was elected Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He became Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire in 1619. In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Derbyshire. In April 1622 he introduced to audiences with the king Schwarzenburg, ambassador from the Emperor Ferdinand, Valerssio from Venice, and d'Arsennes and Joachimi from the United Provinces. He was re- elected MP for Derbyshire in 1624 and 1625. In 1625 he was present at Charles I's marriage with Henrietta Maria. He was high bailiff of Tutbury in 1626 and was re-elected MP for Derbyshire in 1626, until the death of his father early in 1626 gave him a seat in the House of Lords. In the Lords, he resisted George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham's attempt to find a treasonable meaning on a speech of Sir Dudley Digges (13 May 1626). Cavendish's spending strained his resources, and he procured a private Act of Parliament to enable him to sell some of the entailed estates in discharge of his debts in 1628. His London house was in Bishopsgate, on the site afterwards occupied by Devonshire Square. Cavendish died at his London house, from over-indulgence it was said, at the age of about 35 and was buried in Allhallows Church, Derby.

He died on 23 November 1684, at his house at Roehampton, Surrey, and was buried at Edensor. His wife Elizabeth died five years later, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Family Elizabeth, Countess of Devonshire The Countess of Leicester was anxious for him to marry Lady Dorothy Sidney, her daughter and Edmund Waller's \\"Sacharissa\\"; but the match came to nothing. Elizabeth, second daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, became Cavendish's wife, on 4 March 1639. Their children were: *William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire (1640–1707) * Charles Cavendish, died unmarried on 3 March 1671. *Lady Anne Cavendish (c. 1650–1703Burghley House), married Charles, Lord Rich, son of the Earl of Warwick; and then John Cecil, 5th Earl of Exeter on 2 May 1670 and had issue.

Hounslow was one of 40 new barracks established around the country in the wake of the French Revolution, to guard against the dual threats of foreign invasion and domestic sedition. The barracks later became a busy depot for the London military district. It is described by Historic England as 'one of the most significant and complete barracks in the country'. History The area around Hounslow Heath has been used for centuries to garrison Armies of The Crown because of its proximity to London, Windsor Castle and Hampton Court Palace. In the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell marshalled an army on the heath at the end of the English Civil War in 1647. James II also camped his troops here to hold military exercises in an unsuccessful attempt to intimidate the Parliament in London shortly before the Glorious Revolution. =18th century = In 1793, the area became a permanent barracks for troops using the heath when permanent buildings were erected as part of the British response to the threat of the French Revolution. The establishment of large Army barracks inland (rather than as part of the nation's coastal defences) was a novelty in England which, up until this time, had been resisted; people (remembering James II) objected not just to the idea of barracks but to the whole concept of a standing army . A change of policy came about, however, after the French Revolution, when fears of a French invasion were matched by fears of home-grown insurrection. In 1792 plans were drawn up by Pitt's government for six barracks, strategically placed on the outskirts of provincial industrial towns, to house cavalry units which could, if required, be mobilised to maintain public order. A seventh was built on the outskirts of London, at Hounslow. These barracks all shared common features: troopers were accommodated in first-floor barrack rooms above the stables, which were arranged in two long blocks either side of a parade ground, while officers were quartered in a separate building in the centre (a departure from the earlier English tradition whereby officers' quarters were adjacent to and adjoining those of the men). =19th century= In 1818, the War Department (prompted by concerns at the effect of a recent Enclosure Act on the availability of public open space) acquired some of Hounslow Heath to serve as a training ground. In August that year the Prince Regent conducted a review of the troops of the 12th Lancers and the Royal Horse Artillery on the Heath; one of many similar reviews that took place there over the years.Raymond (2003), p.28. Florence Nightingale undertook some of her early training at Hounslow. In June 1846, Private Frederick John White was flogged after a Court-martial sentenced him to 150 lashes for insubordination at Hounslow Barracks. He died a month later making him the last soldier to die after a flogging in the British Army. White was buried in nearby St Leonard's churchyard, Heston. Calls for abolition of flogging were made in Parliament; it was eventually outlawed in 1881. Expansion Fusiliers' Block of 1876, built as part of the expansion of the site. In 1875, the site was significantly expanded to create infantry barracks alongside the cavalry accommodation. Two years earlier a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the two battalions of the 7th Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the regiment evolved to become the Royal Fusiliers with its depot in the barracks in 1881. In 1875, the barracks also became the depot for the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot and the 77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 57th and 77th regiments amalgamated to form the Middlesex Regiment with its depot in the barracks in 1881. By 1884, the barracks had its own railway station on the newly created London Underground. In My Early Life, Winston Churchill recalls travelling on the Underground Railway to Hounslow Barracks two or three times a week whilst living at his mother's house in Knightsbridge around 1896. =20th century= The Middlesex Regiment relocated from Hounslow Barracks to the newly built Inglis Barracks in 1905. During the First World War the barracks was, among other things, headquarters of the Officer Commanding No 10 District, Eastern Command (a district comprising the counties of Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex, as well as the garrison town of Woolwich (excluding Territorial troops)).Raymond (2003), p.120. Between the wars, as well as being the depot of the Royal Fusiliers, Cavalry Barracks continued to house a succession of different regiments of horse. The last (pre-mechanised) cavalry regiment to be stationed at Hounslow was the Royal Scots Greys, which departed in 1938.Raymond (2003), p.120. During World War II the barracks served as Headquarters, Eastern Command from 1939-1941, General Headquarters of the Home Forces from 1941-1944, and again Headquarters, Eastern Command from 1944 (continuing so until 1968).Raymond (2003), p.120. Over the course of the war, many different regiments or units were stationed or billeted at the barracks. On 2 January 1940, work began on converting of adjacent farmland into a hutted camp (Beavers Lane Camp), with additional accommodation for 1500 troops. The farm buildings were used as MT offices and sheds.Raymond (2003), p.120. In late 1941, the 70th Battalion the Middlesex Regiment moved into Hounslow Cavalry Barracks. Known as the \\"Young Soldiers Battalion\\" because they were all 18- and 19-year-old volunteers, they remained there at the barracks until they moved over the road into Beavers Lane Camp in 1942. Hounslow was the first time the troops had been formed together as a battalion since their formation in May 1940, having been scattered in small units in and around London guarding Vulnerable Points (VPs). After the Second World War the barracks continued to serve as Headquarters Eastern Command until 1968Raymond (2003), p.131. (although a separate underground 'War Headquarters' was established at Wilton Park in 1954). The Royal Fusiliers vacated their section of the barracks in 1949 (having had their depot there since the 1870s). In 1968, with the disestablishment of Eastern Command, the barracks became Headquarters, Southern Command, with Lieutenant-General David Peel Yates (the last Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Command) remaining at Hounslow as Commander-in- Chief, Southern Command.Raymond (2003), p.134. Until the 1970s, Cavalry Barracks was also home to the (Army's) West London Communication Centre and the Hounslow Regimental Pay Office manned by members of the Royal Army Pay Corps (whose predecessors had been at Hounslow since at least the early 1900s). From 1981 to 1986, Cavalry barracks was the home of the 1st Bn Grenadier Guards (1st Foot Guards). During their stay they mounted public duties in London and Windsor. They were also responsible for providing military support to the civilian services at Heathrow Airport at the time of high terrorist threat from the IRA. The Battalion also deployed from Hounslow to South Armagh in Northern Ireland. Then the 2nd Bn Scots Guards were there until 1992, carrying out regular public duties, then moving to Redford Barracks in Edinburgh. =21st century= View through the main gate, with the Keep just visible to the left. In 2007, MPs expressed concern in a report that some of the Victorian buildings at Cavalry Barracks were so bad that troops staying in tented camps in Afghanistan had better living conditions than those at Hounslow. Between March 2010 and mid-2011, the Ministry of Defence built 396 en-suite bed spaces in six new accommodation blocks to house 354 junior ranks and 42 for senior non-commissioned officers under their SLAM (single living accommodation modernisation) project to improve military accommodation. The Irish Guards moved into the barracks in June 2015. Closure In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2020. This was later extended to 2021. Architecture Former barracks Chapel, dating from 1845.Former Chapel to Hounslow Cavalry Barracks The barracks is a walled enclave. The essence of its 18th-century layout is largely preserved, with both original and later buildings formally dispersed around the large central parade ground. The site contains 14 Grade II listed buildings and a further 19 locally listed buildings. Hounslow is the only surviving example of the seven large cavalry barracks that were built close to major English towns and cities in the 1790s. They were all designed, along similar lines, by the architect James Johnson, with the three principal buildings arranged on three sides of the parade ground: the officers' quarters as the focal point,Former Officers' Mess and Quarters to Hounslow Cavalry Barracks opposite the main gate, and on either side a parallel pair of long two-storey barrack blocks,Former Stable ranges along the east and west side of former parade ground to Hounslow Calvalry Barracks accommodating both horses (downstairs) and soldiers (upstairs). At Hounslow, small coach houses (later used for forage) were provided at each end of the stable blocks,Former Coach Houses at north and south ends of west stable range and north end of east stable range to Hounslow Cavalry Barracks and to the east of the main square (in line with the officers' quarters) was a riding school and a hospital.Former Hospital (Building 41), Hounslow Barracks Apart from one of the four coach houses, all these buildings have survived at Hounslow (albeit altered over time, in particular the Riding School ('almost unrecognisable' following its conversion into workshops for the Royal Engineers)Raymond (2003), p.32. and the Officers' Quarters which were enlarged (to incorporate a new Officers' Mess) and re-fronted in 1876 as part of the barracks expansion). In the wake of the Crimean War, a Commission for Improving Barracks and Hospitals was set up (under the chairmanship of Sidney Herbert, a close associate of Florence Nightingale). A number of its recommendations were promptly enacted at Hounslow: In 1860 separate quarters for married soldiers were provided in a three-storey building with single-room apartments for 42 families;Former married quarters (Building 16), Hounslow Barracks it is one of the earliest examples of purpose-built accommodation for married soldiers. The following year the 18th-century barrack blocks were provided with verandas, as a means of providing greater ventilation for the upper floors, where troopers slept eight to a room; Lothian Nicholson was the architect for these and other alterations. In 1862 a new hospital building was erected, east of the main parade ground; (at the same time the old hospital was converted to serve as a Sergeants' Mess). Designed by Douglas Galton, it is a very early example (possibly the first in the country) of a hospital built according to his pioneering pavilion principle,Medical Centre (Building 24), Hounslow Barracks (formerly Known as Hounslow Cavalry Barracks Hospital) later seen in his influential Herbert Hospital design. With the establishment at Hounslow of a double Regimental Depot in the 1870s, land to the west was purchased and several new buildings were erected, designed by Colonel C. B. Ewart, R.E. in line with national recommendations. Most prominent among these was the four- storey Armoury (or 'Keep'), which stands near the main entrance;The Keep (Armoury) to Hounslow Cavalry Barracks similarly monumental is the Hardinge Block, one of the largest examples of the type of barracks block being built in new Regimental Depots all round the country at the time (it was formerly one of a parallel pair; the second block, 'Marlborough', was demolished in the late 1960s).Raymond (2003), p.33. Other surviving buildings of this period include the combined former canteen, reading room and sergeants' mess,Naafi (Building 9), Hounslow Barracks the Barrack Master's house,Barrack-Master's House (Building 3), Hounslow Barracks the guard house by the gate and a number of terraced houses.

The Blaenavon Ironworks, now a museum, was a major centre of iron production using locally mined or quarried iron ore, coal and limestone. Raw materials and products were transported via horse-drawn tramroads, canals and steam railways. The Landscape includes protected or listed monuments of the industrial processes, transport infrastructure, workers' housing and other aspects of early industrialisation in South Wales.  Location  The Industrial Revolution in Britain was based on iron and coal, the main products of the South Wales valleys. Production of pig iron in the region grew from 39,600 tons in 1796 to 666,000 tons in 1852, and the iron was used to build railways, factories and engines around the world. Blaenavon was an important centre of coal mining and iron making in South Wales during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Blaenavon Ironworks was opened around 1789 and caused development of the mines, quarries and housing. Blaenavon lies at the upper end of the Afon Lwyd valley in South Wales. The World Heritage Site is based on the large area of land that the Blaenavon Company leased in 1789. The site is on the north eastern rim of the South Wales Coalfield. The area is an excellent example of an industrial landscape formed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by mining and iron making activities. The site contains the Blaenavon Ironworks and the Big Pit coal mine, surrounded by mines and quarries, manufacturing plant, railways, canal, workers' housing and social infrastructure.  Elements of the landscape  The Blaenavon Ironworks operated from 1789 to 1902. Today there are remains of six blast furnaces, cast houses, boiler rooms, engine houses, the water balance tower used to raise and lower trams, and workers' housing around Stack Square. The remains of the furnaces from the late 18th century and the 19th century are well preserved. Other elements include the 1839 water balance tower, two casting houses, ruined kilns, the base of the massive chimney of the blowing engine, the cast-iron structure that carried the blast pipes to the furnaces and ruins of workers' housing. The Big Pit was the last deep coal mine to remain operational in the area. The surface buildings, winding gear and underground workings are still in excellent condition. The Big Pit coal mine, now managed by Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales, was worked from around 1860 until 1980. The original pithead buildings have been preserved, including the head frame, winding engine and baths. The Big Pit Colliery was reopened as a museum in 1983. Visitors may take an underground tour. In 2005 it won the Gulbenkian Prize for museum of the year. Extant buildings from the early industrial period include Ty-Mawr (Big House) also known as Blaenavon House, built for Iron Master, Samuel Hopkins, in 1791, worker's housing terraces, St. Peter's Church (1804), St. Peter's School (1816) and the Blaenavon Workmen's Hall (1894). Other elements of the Industrial Landscape are the mines and quarries from which coal, iron ore, fire clay and limestone were extracted. There are traces of horse-drawn railways, tunnels and inclines that were used to carry iron ore, coal and limestone to the ironworks, and to carry pig iron to the Garnddyrys Forge. Wrought iron was taken from the forge to Llanfoist on the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal for transport to other parts of Britain and the world. There are walks and trails along which visitors may explore the Landscape. Waymarked footpaths follow the tracks of the earliest iron railways. The Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway was once an important transport facility. The steam railway has been restored and has a station in the centre of the town.  Importance  Hill's Tramroad leading from the Pwll Du Tunnel to the Garnddyrys Forge. Line above is the leat that carried water from the balancing pond east of Pwll Du to the forge site at Garnddyrys A area of the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in December 2000. Blaenavon was the first \\"cultural landscape\\" to be recognised in the United Kingdom. About £40 million was spent in the first ten years. The Landscape meets two criteria for a World Heritage Site. *Criterion (iii): An exceptional illustration in material form of the social and economic structure of 19th century industry. *Criterion (iv): An outstanding and remarkably complete example of a 19th-century industrial landscape. The boundary of the property includes the main monuments of the mining and iron working settlement, in remarkably good condition, and the remains of mine, quarry and transport infrastructure. It is possible to trace the complex industrial process and its social aspects in the early Industrial Revolution.  Preservation  Blaenavon World Heritage Centre The Landscape includes 24 scheduled monuments and 82 listed buildings, of which the most important are publicly owned. At the time of inscription as a World Heritage Site many of the elements were vulnerable due to lack of conservation. Since then there has been extensive work on conserving the ironworks, Big Pit and other historic elements of Blaenavon and the surrounding landscape. There are continued efforts to ensure that new development does not reduce the value and appearance of the Landscape. The Torfaen County Borough Council, Brecon Beacons National Park Authority and Monmouthshire County Council have statutory planning responsibility for parts of the Landscape. The development plans of these authorities aim to protect the property, which is also covered by provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act (1980) and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act, 1990). The Blaenavon Town Centre and Cwmavon are conservation areas, and there is a proposal to make Forgeside and Glantorfaen another conservation area. A World Heritage Centre was opened for visitors in 2008. The Landscape is managed by the Blaenavon Partnership, which involves various authorities, agencies and other bodies and is led by Torfaen County Borough Council. A World Heritage Day is held in June each year. A cost-benefit analysis of the world heritage status has shown that it had succeeded in regenerating the area.

His father Erasmus (1794–1865) arranged for Ferdinand's first public appearance at age six. His first solo concert was at age ten in the Stavovské divadlo (a theater in Prague). From 1843 to 1846, he studied at the Prague Conservatory. He began his adult career as a virtuoso in Vienna, at the imperial court. In 1850, he traveled across Europe with a series of exhibitions. He stayed for a longer time in Weimar and Berlin (1855–62 as professor at the Stern Conservatory). From 1866 to 1874 he was professor of violin at the Moscow Conservatory, where his many notable students included Stanisław Barcewicz. Laub was a well-admired violinist, winning awards all over Europe; Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky called him \\"the best violinist of our time\\". He was the first violinist in the premiere performances of both Tchaikovsky's First and Second String Quartets, and the posthumous dedicatee of the Third of 1876. In January 1868, during Hector Berlioz's second trip to Moscow, Laub performed the solo viola part of his Harold en Italie at the Moscow Conservatory under the composer's baton.Berlioz in Russia, The second visit: 1868 In 1874, lung disease forced him to stop working.

It lies in Loch Dunvegan, off the northwest coast of the Isle of Skye. Two smaller isles of Mingay and Clett lie nearby. The name originated from the Old Norse ise-øy meaning porpoise island. The island of Lampay is due south. The area of Isay is . An October sunset over Isay, with the Outer Hebrides in the distance. History The first recorded owner of Isay and its surrounding islets was Olaf the Black, the 13th century ruler of the Kingdom of the Isles. In the 16th century the main house on the island was inhabited by the MacLeods of Lewis, and it was here that Roderick Macleod of Lewis ('Nimheach' - the venomous) implemented his plan to ensure that his grandson would inherit Raasay and the lands of Gairloch. He convened the two powerful families (names do not appear to have been recorded) of the time at Isay house for a banquet which he suggested was to inform them of good news. During the feast he invited each person present to accompany him outside of the banquet hall in order to inform them of this news. Upon leaving the hall the victim was promptly stabbed to death. In this way both families were wiped out.http://northwesthighlands.pesdablog.com/2007/03/21/the-banquet-on-the- island-of-isay/ The island was home to a small fishing community in around the 1830s, which included a general store and fishing station, and by 1841 supported 15 families \\"in considerable comfort\\".

The remains of the 18 or more cottages can be clearly seen from the Waternish peninsula, which overlooks the three islands. The island was briefly owned by the singer Donovan in the 1960s.

When the horseshoe magnet (right) is rotated, the magnetic field through the iron changes from one direction to the other, and the crackling Barkhausen noise is heard in the earphone. Magnetization (J) or flux density (B) curve as a function of magnetic field intensity (H) in ferromagnetic material. The inset shows Barkhausen jumps. Origin of the Barkhausen noise: as a domain wall moves it gets caught on a defect in the crystal lattice, then \\"snaps\\" past it, creating a sudden change in the magnetic field. The Barkhausen effect is a name given to the noise in the magnetic output of a ferromagnet when the magnetizing force applied to it is changed. Discovered by German physicist Heinrich Barkhausen in 1919, it is caused by rapid changes of size of magnetic domains (similarly magnetically oriented atoms in ferromagnetic materials). Barkhausen's work in acoustics and magnetism led to the discovery, which became the main piece of experimental evidence supporting the domain theory of ferromagnetism proposed in 1906 by Pierre-Ernest Weiss. The Barkhausen effect is a series of sudden changes in the size and orientation of ferromagnetic domains, or microscopic clusters of aligned atomic magnets (spins), that occurs during a continuous process of magnetization or demagnetization. The Barkhausen effect offered direct evidence for the existence of ferromagnetic domains, which previously had been postulated theoretically. Heinrich Barkhausen discovered that a slow, smooth increase of a magnetic field applied to a piece of ferromagnetic material, such as iron, causes it to become magnetized, not continuously but in minute steps. Barkhausen noise When an external magnetizing field through a piece of ferromagnetic material is changed, for example by moving a magnet toward or away from an iron bar, the magnetization of the material changes in a series of discontinuous changes, causing \\"jumps\\" in the magnetic flux through the iron. These can be detected by winding a coil of wire around the bar, attached to an amplifier and loudspeaker. The sudden transitions in the magnetization of the material produce current pulses in the coil, which when amplified produce a sound in the loudspeaker. This makes a crackling sound, which has been compared to candy being unwrapped, Rice Krispies, or the sound of a log fire. This sound, first discovered by German physicist Heinrich Barkhausen, is called Barkhausen noise. Similar effects can be observed by applying only mechanical stresses (e.g. bending) to the material placed in the detecting coil. These magnetization jumps are caused by discrete changes in the size or rotation of ferromagnetic domains. Domains change size by the domain walls moving within the crystal lattice in response to changes in the magnetic field, by the process of dipoles near the wall changing spin to align with spins in the neighboring domain. In a perfect crystal lattice this is can be a continuous process, but in actual crystals local defects in the lattice, such as impurity atoms or dislocations in the structure form temporary barriers to the change of spin, causing the domain wall to be hung up on the defect. When the change in magnetic field becomes strong enough to overcome the local energy barrier at the defect, it causes a group of atoms to flip their spin at once, as the domain wall \\"snaps\\" past the defect. This sudden change in magnetization causes a transient change in magnetic flux through the bar, which is picked up by the coil as a \\"click\\" in the earphone. The energy loss due to the domain walls moving through these defects is responsible for the hysteresis curve of ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity often have more of these defects, so they produce more Barkhausen noise for a given magnetic flux change, while materials with low coercivity, such as silicon steel transformer laminations, are processed to eliminate defects, so they produce little Barkhausen noise. Practical use A set-up for non-destructive testing of ferromagnetic materials: green – magnetising yoke, red – inductive sensor, grey – sample under test. The amount of Barkhausen noise for a given material is linked with the amount of impurities, crystal dislocations, etc. and can be a good indication of mechanical properties of such a material. Therefore, the Barkhausen noise can be used as a method of non-destructive evaluation of the degradation of mechanical properties in magnetic materials subjected to cyclic mechanical stresses (e.g. in pipeline transport) or high-energy particles (e.g. nuclear reactor) or materials such as high-strength steels which may be subjected to damage from grinding. Schematic diagram of a simple non-destructive set-up for such a purpose is shown on the right. Barkhausen noise can also indicate physical damage in a thin film structure due to various nanofabrication processes such as reactive ion etching or using an ion milling machine.

Garfinkel (born 1965) is the US Census Bureau's Senior Computer Scientist for Confidentiality and Data Access. Previously, he was a computer scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (2015-2017) and, prior to that, an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California (2006-2015). In addition to his research, Garfinkel is a journalist, an entrepreneur, and an inventor; his work is generally concerned with computer security, privacy, and information technology.  Research  Garfinkel's early research was in the field of optical storage. While he was an undergraduate at the MIT Media Laboratory, Garfinkel developed CDFS, the first file system for write-once optical disk systems.S. Garfinkel, \\"A file system for write once media, MIT Media Lab., Oct. 1986. During the summer of 1987, he worked at Brown University's IRIS Project, where he developed a server allowing CDROMs to be shared over a network simultaneously by multiple workstations.Designing a write-once file system (a general-purpose optical storage software technology), Dr. Dobb's Journal, 1991, Jan, pp. 78, 80, 82-- 26. In 1991, while a senior editor at NeXTWORLD magazine, Garfinkel created an address book program for the NeXT Computer called SBook. One of SBook's most popular features was a search field that performed a full-text search of all of the records in the address book with each keypress. This kind of search is now standard on many computer programs, including Apple's Mail application and Mozilla Thunderbird. SBook was one of the first programs to incorporate this kind of search technology. In 1995, Garfinkel moved to Martha's Vineyard and started Vineyard.NET, the Vineyard's first Internet Service Provider. Vineyard.NET was bought by Broadband2Wireless, a wireless ISP, in 2000. The company went bankrupt in September 2001, and Garfinkel bought Vineyard.NET back from the bankruptcy court. In 1998, Garfinkel founded Sandstorm Enterprises, a computer security firm that developed advanced computer forensic tools used by businesses and governments to audit their systems. Sandstorm was acquired by Niksun in 2010. Garfinkel is the inventor of six patents, mostly in the field of computer security. In 2003, Garfinkel and Abhi Shelat published an article in IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine reporting on an experiment in which they purchased 158 used hard drives from a variety of sources and checked to see whether they still contained readable data. Roughly one third of the drives appeared to have information that was highly confidential and should have been erased prior to the drive's resale. In 2006, Garfinkel introduced cross-drive analysis, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automatically reconstructing social networks from hard drives and other kinds of data-carrying devices that are likely to contain pseudo- unique information.Garfinkel, S., \\"Forensic Feature Extraction and Cross-Drive Analysis,\\" Digital Investigation, Volume 3, Supplement 1, September 2006, Pages 71--81. http://www.simson.net/clips/academic/2006.DFRWS.pdf In September 2006, Garfinkel joined the faculty of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, as an associate professor of Computer Science. He moved to Arlington, Virginia, in June 2010 to help NPS with its research aims in the National Capital Region. He transitioned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology in January 2015, and to the US Census Bureau in 2017.

Historically, Bulmershe Court has been the name of a manor and of two quite distinct country houses, one of which still stands but is now known as Bulmershe Manor. The site first opened for teaching in 1964 as Bulmershe College. That merged with the University of Reading in 1989 to create the Bulmershe Court campus. It closed in 2012 and all its activities have moved to either the London Road Campus or Whiteknights Park. On 23 December 2013, CALA Homes acquired the site for a residential development of 290 dwellings. On 25 December 2013 Bulmershe Court hall of residence was burnt down. Campus =Academic profile= Bulmershe College became the Bulmershe Court Campus of the University of Reading in 1989, housing its Faculty of Education (later Institute of Education) and Community Studies (later School of Health and Social Care).http://alumni.reading.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=779 It continued to offer courses in education, community studies, social work, and film, theatre and television studies until 2011/12. =Buildings= Original buildings were retained and updated, including a £1 million refurbishment of the existing Bob Kayley Studio building (named after the first Head of Film and Drama at Bulmershe College) into a fully fitted 90 seater theatre also open to the public. The former Bridges Hall space was converted into a lecture theatre, and several new student halls of residence were built on the site as part of Bulmershe Hall. The campus was made up of many different buildings, some of those being accommodation retained from the original Bulmershe College – including Mitford, Penn, Winchcombe and Blagrave – and some newly built on merger with the University, including Hollins and Huntley. One of the original halls continued to bear the name Blagrave in testament to the long history of buildings on the site. The refurbished Bob Kayley Studio (referred to above) saw its last performance in December 2010. Courses in Film and Drama Studies were being moved to the main Whiteknights campus and to a new purpose built home – the Minghella Building – named after the late film director Anthony Minghella, who was made an Honorary Professor of the University in 2006 before his death. =Closure= Financial pressures faced by the University of Reading after the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–8, and the usual university re-organisations, meant that from 2010 there had been uncertainty about the fate of accommodation and teaching on the campus. With the end of teaching and most accommodation in 2011 the University set about redeveloping the site for housing and an old peoples' care home. The Library was moved to Whiteknights. Social work programmes ended in September 2011. Courses were transferred to the University of West London (formerly Thames Valley University), who operate them from a Reading site in Crescent Road (previously the home of the Reading College of Technology).http://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-467637.aspx All activity on the Bulmershe Campus ended in 2012 apart from use of the playing fields. Institute of Education courses were relocated to completely refurbished University buildings based at London Road campus in 2012. By 2013, all education activity has ceased and some buildings yet to be demolished were offered for temporary commercial rental. =Re-development= The re- development of the grounds had to take into account of the listed nature of the old Bulmershe Court manor building.

The poem was written on October 12, 1962, four months before her death and one month after her separation from Ted Hughes. It was published posthumously in Ariel during 1965 alongside many other of her poems leading up to her death such as \\"Tulips” and \\"Lady Lazarus.\\" \\"Daddy\\" employs controversial metaphors of the Holocaust to explain Plath's complex relationship with her father, Otto Plath, who died shortly after her eighth birthday as a result of undiagnosed diabetes. The poem itself is cryptic, a widely anthologized poem in American literature, and its implications, as well as thematic concerns, have been reviewed academically, with many differing conclusions.  Biographical background  Before her publication of Ariel, Plath had been a high academic achiever attending Cambridge University in England. It was at Cambridge University where she met Ted Hughes, a young Yorkshire poet, and they wed in the summer of June 1956. However, their marriage was short-lived as Hughes had been having an affair with another woman which caused him and Plath to separate. After her separation from Hughes, Plath moved with her two children into a Yeats' flat in London during December 1962 and where \\"Daddy\\" was written. Shortly after, Plath committed suicide by consumption of sleeping pills and gas inhalation by putting her head in a gas oven on February 11, 1963. However, before Plath’s death, beginning in October 1962, Plath wrote at least 26 of the poems that would be published posthumously in the collection Ariel. In these Plath wrote about anger, including macabre humor, and resistance in \\"Daddy.\\" Yet at the same time, she contrasted those mentioned dark subject matters with themes of joy, in hand with a deeper understanding of the numerous hindering functions of women. \\"Daddy\\" included humor and realistic subject matter that would, later on, be known as the \\"October poems.\\" The “October poems” were composed of Plath’s anger as a woman who felt oppressed by her parents' expectations of her, society’s hindering roles in place for women, and by her ex-husband’s unfaithfulness. Plath’s anger had been voiced in her later poems including \\"Lady Lazarus\\" and \\"Daddy.\\"  Description  =Structure, form, and rhyme= Plath wrote the poem in quintains with irregular meter and irregular rhyme. The rhyming words all end with an \\"oo\\" vowel sound (like the words \\"through,\\" \\"you,\\" \\"blue,\\" \\"do,\\" and \\"shoe\\"). = Subject matter = Sylvia Plath’s poem \\"Daddy\\" had very dark tones and imagery including death and suicide, in addition to the Holocaust. Plath wrote about her father's death that occurred when she was eight years old and of her ongoing battle trying to free herself from her father. Plath’s father, Otto Plath, had died from complications after his leg amputation. He had been ill previously before his death for around four years before finally dying from untreated diabetes mellitus. Initially in \\"Daddy,\\" Plath idolizes her father, going as far as to compare him to God. However, as her poem progresses she, later compares him to a swastika and what it symbolizes. Plath alludes to her father being a Nazi soldier and in contrast, compares herself to a Jewish prisoner. The metaphor Plath employed is a means of expressing her relationship with her father. Plath ultimately had feared her father and was terrified of him as those who were Jewish were terrified of the Nazi soldiers. She includes various references to the masses brutally murdered by the Holocaust and the destruction of war in her poem. = Interpretation = Some critics have interpreted \\"Daddy\\" in both biographical and psychoanalytic terms. For instance, critic Robert Phillips wrote, \\"Finally the one way [Plath] was to achieve relief, to become an independent Self, was to kill her father's memory, which, in 'Daddy,' she does by a metaphorical murder. Making him a Nazi and herself a Jew, she dramatizes the war in her soul. . . From its opening image onward, that of the father as an \\"old shoe\\" in which the daughter has lived for thirty years—an explicitly phallic image, according to the writings of Freud—the sexual pull and tug is manifest, as is the degree of Plath's mental suffering, supported by references to Dachau, Auschwitz, and Belsen.\\"Phillips, Robert. \\"The Dark Tunnel: A Reading of Sylvia Plath.\\" Modern Poetry Studies 3.2 (1972). Critics writers Guinevara A. Nance and Judith P. Jones take the same approach of psychoanalyzing Plath via \\"Daddy.\\" They essentially make the same argument as Phillips as they also write that \\"[Plath] accentuates linguistically the speaker's reliving of her childhood. Using the heavy cadences of nursery rhyme and baby words such as 'chuffing,' 'achoo,' and 'gobbledygoo,' she employs a technical device similar to Joyce's in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, where the child's simple perspective is reflected through language.\\"Concerning Poetry 11:1 (Spring 1978). University Lecturer of English Literature and author Rudolph Glitz, argues the poem could be interpreted additionally as a break-up letter. In some verses of the poem, Glitz mentions \\"Daddy\\" addresses another person aside from Plath and her father. The line, “the vampire who said he was you” Glitz argues is referencing Plath’s estranged husband, Ted Hughes. Further suggested by the line in which Plath wrote “I do, I do” in and the “seven years” the vampire had drunk Plath’s blood. Plath was married to Ted Hughes for seven years. In the very last lines of the poem, the vampire figure merges with Plath’s father, “Daddy.” Plath also writes before this merge, the \\"black phone\\" has been disconnected so that the “voices” could not “worm through,” which Glitz also connects to Plath's discovery of Hughes's affair when Plath answered a telephone call from Hughes's lover. Lisa Narbeshuber’s essay,“The Poetics of Torture: The Spectacle of Sylvia Plath's Poetry\\" displayed how several of Plath's most famous poems, including \\"Daddy,\\" portrayed the female figure in opposition to male authority. Narbeshuber argued the objectified female form had been previously displayed was now confronting and renouncing the oppressive and social as well as cultural norms that dehumanized women. Narbeshuber went on to credit Plath for tackling issues of female identity that once silenced women. “Daddy,” she argued, showed the female transformation of the 1950s into a “transgressive dialect.\\" The bringing of one’s private self into the public realm. The rebellious speaker in “Daddy” made the invisible visible and the private-public. Plath dramatized her imprisonment and fantasized about defeating her tormentors through the means of killing them. Plath identified with the persecuted Jews, the marginalized and the hidden, as her body had been stolen from her and divided into articles belonging to the Nazis to do as they wished with them. With that said, Narbeshuber argued Plath had been trying to assume herself and not succumb to the stress that was imposed on the female body.  Critical reception  Critic George Steiner referred to \\"Daddy\\" as \\"the Guernica of modern poetry\\", arguing that it \\"achieves the classic art of generalization, translating a private, obviously intolerable hurt into a code of plain statement, of instantaneously public images which concern us all\\". Adam Kirsch has written that some of Plath's works, like \\"Daddy\\", are self-mythologizing and suggests that readers should not interpret the poem as a strictly \\"confessional\\", autobiographical poem about her actual father.Kirsch, Adam. The Wounded Surgeon: Confession and Transformation in Six American Poets: The Poetry of Lowell, Bishop, Berryman, Jarrell, Schwartz, and Plath. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. Sylvia Plath herself also did not describe the poem in autobiographical terms. When she introduced the poem for a BBC radio reading shortly before her suicide, she described the piece in the third person, stating that the poem was about \\"a girl with an Electra complex [whose] father died while she thought he was God. Her case is complicated by the fact that her father was also a Nazi and her mother very possibly part Jewish. In the daughter the two strains marry and paralyze each other – she has to act out the awful little allegory once over before she is free of it\\". Jacqueline Shea Murphy wrote the essay, “‘This Holocaust I Walk In’: Consuming Violence in Sylvia Plath’s Poetry” where she stated that “Daddy” was an example of the fall of violent authoritative control over Plath’s body. Murphy further defined that the particular fall was not just in reference to Plath’s body but the fall of the violent control of numerous bodies throughout history. The violent control of various bodies as dramatized in \\"Daddy\\" portrayed the transformation of said bodies as representatives of oppression. The speaker of \\"Daddy,\\" moved from the position of the oppressed to the position of the oppressor. The oppressed in \\"Daddy\\" being the Jewish people due to their torment in the death camps. The oppressor was one capable of killing as well as committing the torment. “Daddy, I have had to kill you,” said the speaker who “maybe a bit of a Jew” and whose Daddy was a Nazi. Murphy emphasized that Plath spoke of the division between either being oppressed or oppressing, being controlled or control, and being mutilated or mutilate. Murphy argued Plath was referring to the survival of the fittest while simultaneously exposing the party in power. Murphy also claimed that Plath had been protesting the patriarchy’s ways of obtaining power and authority. The power struggles throughout \\"Daddy\\" appeared to be explicitly gendered as the speaker is generally female and spoke out to expose and get back at men. The mentioned metaphors of oppression were used to describe the power struggles prevalent throughout \\"Daddy.\\" Murphy explained that the power structure would remain intact, yet Plath imagined herself being the one in control and tormenting her tormentors. According to Murphy, Plath emphasized the power of the oppressed, the mutilated body, as she recognized the oppressor was entirely dependent on the oppressed. The mutilated, oppressed bodies were as important and as a result become the authoritative figure to be read.

It is classified as part of the Khuddaka Nikaya, the collection of minor books in the Sutta Pitaka. A similar text, the Therigatha, contains verses attributed to early Buddhist nuns.  Overview  The Theragatha consists of 264 poems, organized into 21 chapters. Chapters are based on the number of verses in the poem, but beyond chapter 16 the chapter headings are only a rough guide. Various figures for the number of total verses in the collection are given- the oral tradition claimed 1360, 1294 are mentioned in summaries within the text, but a plain count of the verses gives a number of 1279. This may be because different versions of the Theragatha were combined to produce the current version of the text. While most of the verses are spoken by the monk to whom they are attributed, some seem to have become associated with them in other ways- some verses are addressed to the monk the poem is named for, and a collection of verses associated with Ananda contains a mix of verses recited by or to Ananda on various occasions. Several verses in the Theragatha appear elsewhere in the canon, attributed to the same monks. Most of the monks in the Theragatha lived during the time of the Buddha, but the collection seems to have continued to grow until at least the Third Buddhist Council. The omission of similar verses that were included in the Milindapanha suggests that while chapters continued to be added to the Theragatha for a period of 300 years or so, the collection was ultimately closed and put in a final form. A variety of early and late poetic meters are employed, and K.R. Norman suggests that the inclusion of miracle stories and congregations of gods are indicative of later additions. Some of the verses in the collection seem to mirror contemporary secular poetry of their time, with romantic lyrics replaced with religious imagery. Notable texts from the Theragatha include the eighth poem of chapter sixteen, consisting of verses recited by the reformed killer Angulimala, and the third poem of chapter seventeen, in which the Buddha's cousin and retainer Ananda mourns the passing of his master. Many of the verses of the Theragatha concern the attempts of monks to overcome the temptations of Mara.  Related Works  A single commentary attributed to Dhammapala covers both the Theragatha and Therigatha. In one case, a poem appears to have been split with verses attributed to a monk appearing in the Theragatha, and verses attributed to his mother placed in the Therigatha. Fragments of a Sanskrit version of the Theragatha preserved by the Sarvastivadin tradition, known as the Sthaviragatha, were discovered in Turkestan and published in 1961.

(For a more detailed definition, see the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Appendix A.). This should not be confused with a permanent change of assignment (PCA), which describes the reassignment of active duty personnel to a new unit within the same military post. This term is also used for other United States government employees, such as a Foreign Service Officer, special agent, diplomats, and other civilian, non-military personnel, being stationed in embassies and consulates around the world. Temporary duty assignment In contrast, a temporary duty assignment is a shorter-term change of station, usually less than six months. Travel expenses Traditionally, the cost of transportation for an officer and his family was initially paid for by the officer receiving the PCS orders, and he would be reimbursed upon arrival for expenses and pay en route. Lieutenant Commander Joseph P. Fyffe changed this custom in 1870 when he was assigned to travel from New England to San Francisco in order to take a new assignment. Since he had no funds for travel, he walked. He strapped his dress sword to a small suitcase and began walking from New England to San Francisco, sending a telegram each night showing his progress and nightly accommodations. After five days on the road, his shoes gave out, and he sent this telegram: \\"30 August 1870.

In 1942, Holyoke Publishing acquired the character, and continued publishing Cat-Man Comics. Cat-Man Comics ran for 33 issues (12 published by Holyoke Publishing) with the last issue being numbered 32 due to some numbering inconsistencies, through 1946, when Temerson's Continental Magazines folded.Continental Magazines, Inc. at the Grand Comics Database Eventually, the characters fell into the public domain. = Fictional character biography = David Merrywether (Cat-Man) was raised in Burma by a tigress after his parents had been killed. From living with tigers for years, he gained superhuman abilities, such as super-strength, enhanced agility, natural night vision, and the legendary \\"nine lives\\" of cats. Eventually, David returned to the U.S. where he was horrified by criminals preying on the innocent. To stop this, he became a private investigator. Later, he would become an officer in the US Army. Assigned to stateside duties, he donned an olive and orange costume with a black cat-head symbol and became Cat-Man. In Cat-Man Comics vol. 1, issue #10 (#5 on the cover), Cat-Man encountered Katie Conn, an 11-year-old circus acrobat who fell under the guardianship of her unscrupulous uncle after her parents died in a fire.

She tried to help him fight crime, sewing a matching red and yellow costume and calling herself the Kitten. At first, David tried to keep her from helping him, but Katie eventually proved herself as his sidekick and the two became partners. As the series continued, Katie matured and David was promoted to the rank of captain.

However, Cat-Man was a superb fighter and a brilliant inventor, armed with a Luger pistol, a pair of night vision goggles with the ability to temporarily blind foes with a light that emanated from the goggles, and a utility belt similar to Batman's. Cat-Man was based in a mountaintop headquarters, with his primary area of operations being that of the Australian outback. However, when situations needed, he would range all over the globe to fight crime. When he did so, he was assisted by his male sidekick, Kit; his fiancée, Terri West, an employee of the United Nations; and her father, Professor West, a famous scientist. The Australian Cat-Man would run for a shorter period than its predecessor, spanning twelve issues. In the 1950s, Tricho would reprint them as Catman Comics #13–22. The characters also appeared in the Giant Phantom Comics series. Modern Age =AC Comics= AC Comics' revival of Cat-Man and Kitten. In the 1980s, publisher AC Comics created a retconned version of the characters as part of their universe. In this version, Katie's change from a young girl to an adult was given an explanation: mortally wounded by one of their enemies, Katie's life was saved when Cat-Man transferred one of his 9 lives into her. However, this had the effect of automatically aging her into adulthood, although she still retained a child's mentality, causing Cat-Man some consternation in his secret identity. Eventually, her emotional maturity caught up with her physical form, and the pair were married. They soon after decided to enter the Vault of Superheroes, a suspended animation program being run by the US government to preserve heroes should they be needed in the future. Released from the Vault in the 1980s, they adapted to modern life and became allies to Miss Victory and the members of Femforce. Unfortunately, their primary nemesis, Dr. Macabre, was also revived from a similar hibernation and continues to pose a threat to the Merryweathers. AC Comics has printed modern stories of Cat-Man and Kitten in its Men of Mystery anthology; it also reprints some of the Holyoke stories that do not contradict its current continuity. Due to the female-oriented nature of the AC Comics universe, the duo is sometimes billed as Kitten and Cat-Man. =Dynamite Entertainment= In 2008, Cat-Man and Kitten appeared in flashbacks in Dynamite Entertainment's Project Superpowers. In the Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude one-shot, it was stated that the two heroes would appear in future issues in this line — Cat-Man as a feral being called Man-Cat and Kitten as part of a team of kid heroes and sidekicks. Project Superpowers: Chapter Two showcased an increasing line of public domain superheroes including Cat-Man and Kitten. After being freed from the urn, the Kitten finds herself allied with several teen sidekicks, including the Boy King and his Giant. The group of young heroes sets out to find some of their missing mentors and begin to discover they were not just blessed with increased abilities, but in some instances cursed by them. Kitten discovers Cat-Man living like a feral beast in the jungle. His senses, strength and agility increased to the level of the great cats he emulated. Unfortunately, his intelligence and demeanor regressed to a similar state and the teen heroes had to snare Cat-Man like a wild beast. Cat-Man and Kitten become pivotal characters in one of the side stories throughout this series. By series end, Cat-Man regains enough of his senses for Kitten to know the man is still inside the beast.

Her memoir was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Early life and education A child of Wilburn and Christina Mason, Bobbie Ann Mason grew up on her family's dairy farm outside of Mayfield, Kentucky with four siblings. As a child she loved to read with encouragement from her parents, however choices were limited. These books were mostly popular fiction about the Bobbsey Twins and the Nancy Drew mysteries. She would later write a book about these books she read in adolescence titled The Girl Sleuth: A feminist guide to the Bobbsey Twins, Nancy Drew, and Their Sisters. Mason credits her time at a grade school in Cuba, Kentucky with influencing her adult fictional characters. After high school, Mason went on to major in English at the University of Kentucky. After graduating in 1962, she worked for a fan magazine publisher in New York City, writing articles about various stars who were in the spotlight for movie magazines that Mason describes as \\"fluff.\\" She earned her master's degree at the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1966. Next she went to graduate school at the University of Connecticut, where she subsequently received her Ph.D. in literature with a dissertation on Vladimir Nabokov's Ada in 1972. Her dissertation was published as Nabokov's Garden two years later while Mason taught at Mansfield State College (now Mansfield University). Career By the time she was in her late thirties, Mason started to write short stories. In 1980, The New Yorker published her first story. \\"It took me a long time to discover my material\\", she said. \\"It wasn't a matter of developing writing skills, it was a matter of knowing how to see things. And it took me a very long time to grow up. I'd been writing for a long time, but was never able to see what there was to write about. I always aspired to things away from home, so it took me a long time to look back at home and realize that that's where the center of my thought was.\\" Mason has written about the working-class people of Western Kentucky, and her short stories have contributed to a renaissance of regional fiction in America creating a literary style that critics have labeled \\"shopping mall realism.\\" Mason then went on to write a collection of short stories, Shiloh and Other Stories. In 1985, she published her first novel, In Country, which eventually was made into a feature film (see below). She followed In Country with another novel in 1988, Spence and Lila. She has since published several more short story collections (see below). In 2016, Mason became the second living author to be inducted into the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame. Mason's dissertation, a critique of Vladimir Nabokov's Ada or Ardor, was published in 1974. A year later, she published The Girl Sleuth, a feminist assessment of Nancy Drew, the Bobbsey Twins, and other fictional girl detectives. Mason's first volume of short stories, Shiloh and Other Stories, appeared in 1982 and won the 1983 Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award for outstanding first works of fiction. Mason's novel In Country is often cited as one of the seminal literary works of the 1980s. Its protagonist attempts to come to terms with a number of important generational issues, ranging from the Vietnam War to consumer culture. A film version was produced in 1989, starring Emily Lloyd as the protagonist and Bruce Willis as her uncle. Her short stories have appeared in numerous magazines, including The Atlantic Monthly, Mother Jones, The New Yorker, and The Paris Review. Mason has received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She was a writer in residence at the University of Kentucky until 2011. Her short story, \\"Wish\\", appears in The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women. Patchwork: A Bobbie Ann Mason Reader was published in 2018.

Based on Christian principles and the traditions of the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church, Alpha Delta Gamma was founded at Loyola University Chicago on October 10, 1924, as a response to the unwillingness of most national fraternities to colonize at Catholic colleges and universities. Since its founding, Alpha Delta Gamma has expanded conservatively to keep a small but strong brotherhood; thus, the fraternity has chartered 33 chapters in its long history. Today, Alpha Delta Gamma operates 14 active chapters at private and public colleges across the United States, stretching from Los Angeles, California, to New York City, New York. History Alpha Delta Gamma was founded at the Lake Shore campus of Loyola University Chicago on October 10, 1924, by four students: Francis Patrick Canary, John Joseph Dwyer, William S. Hallisey and James Collins O'Brien, Jr. According to the Alpha Delta Gamma National Web Site, \\"In effect, they wanted a fraternity founded upon Christian ideals of true manhood, sound learning, and the unity of fraternal brotherhood. These ideals decreed the purpose of Alpha Delta Gamma when it first came into being. And so the foundation was set, Alpha Delta Gamma was on its way to becoming a city walled!\\" In 1926, members of the local organization Delta Theta at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri, contacted the Alpha chapter at Loyola University Chicago, requesting permission to affiliate with the then existing fraternity. Their request was granted and, on October 26, 1927, Alpha Delta Gamma officially charted its Beta chapter, becoming a national fraternity. The fraternity continued expanding to other Catholic colleges and universities and adopted the descriptive \\"National Catholic-College Fraternity.\\" This was eventually changed to \\"National Catholic Social Fraternity\\" when the organization began expansion to non-Catholic colleges and universities. Alpha Delta Gamma has remained a small national fraternity, with a total of thirty-two collegiate chapters, fourteen of which are active. Most chapters are located at Catholic universities, but there are no religious requirements for membership.

Seven founding members strove to create a brotherhood that would last long after their college days. They were Brother Cesidio A. Guarini, Brother Ferdinand F. DiBartolo, Brother Anthony T. Frascati, Brother Nicholas Frunzi, Brother Otto Gelormini, Brother Dominic T. Ciolli, and Brother Joseph Cangiamila. Soon after its founding, Alpha Phi Delta spread from Syracuse and became a national fraternity. Alpha Phi Delta is traditionally an Italian-American heritage fraternity; however, since September 2, 1965, it has welcomed young men of all racial backgrounds. Founding After the creation of the Alpha Chapter at Syracuse University, Nicholas Frunzi transferred to Columbia University in 1916. He became friends with the brothers of a fraternity that had similar values as Alpha Phi Delta, Sigma Gamma Phi. After convincing the founding fathers of Sigma Gamma Phi to merge, Columbia University became the Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Delta, hence becoming a national fraternity. As time passed the fraternity grew bigger. Unfortunately, a lot of chapters have been shut down due to inactivity. So far the fraternity has around +40 collegiate chapters.

He served as the head football coach at Dartmouth College from 1934 to 1940 and at the United States Military Academy from 1941 to 1958, compiling a career college football record of 166–48–14. His Army football teams won three consecutive national championships in 1944, 1945 and 1946. Blaik was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1964. Early life and playing career Miami University basketball team in 1917, Blaik is second from the right. Blaik was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of William Blaik, a blacksmith and carriage maker who emigrated from Glasgow, Scotland in 1883. In 1901 the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, where his father became a contractor. He played college football for three seasons at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio under Chester J. Roberts, George Rider and George Little and two seasons at the United States Military Academy at West Point where he became a third-team All-American. Following his graduation in 1920, Blaik served in the United States Cavalry for two years. After his military service, Blaik married and worked in the construction business with his father. Coaching career During the 1924 and 1925 seasons, Blaik worked as a part-time assistant coach for Miami University. For a few months in 1926, he accepted a coaching position on the staff of University of Wisconsin–Madison head football coach George Little. In 1927, Blaik became a part-time coach at the United States Military Academy until 1930 when he was accepted on the staff as a full-time assistant coach. In 1934, Blaik was hired as head football coach at Dartmouth College. At Dartmouth he coached for seven seasons and compiled a record of 45–16–4, his Dartmouth teams had a 22-game unbeaten streak from 1934 to 1937. He coached one Hall of Fame player at Dartmouth, Bob MacLeod. In 1941, Blaik was tapped to be head football coach for the United States Military Academy. Army had suffered two consecutive losing seasons in 1939 and 1940, a first since 1906, and dropped its requirements for its coach to be a serving graduate and that all players meet restrictive height-to- weight limitations. The latter was a condition Blaik made as a requirement for him to accept the position, believing Army to be severely handicapped in the size of its linemen. The United States Naval Academy did not have the same restrictions and the Army surgeon general was persuaded to drop the requirement for football players. At West Point, Blaik coached for 18 seasons compiling a 121–32–10 record. Blaik's Army teams had a 32-game unbeaten streak from 1944 to 1947, won consecutive national titles in 1944 and 1945, and finished second in the nation in 1946 with their record blemished only by a scoreless tie with rival Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium. In 1946, Blaik was selected as the AFCA Coach of the Year. In 1948, he became one of the first college coaches to implement a two-platoon system, using players strictly for offense or defense.When Pride Still Mattered, David Maraniss, p.105, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, New York, NY, 1999, Blaik was also one of the first coaches to analyze the game play-by-play, charting a team’s tendencies on every down with the use of game film.When Pride Still Mattered, David Maraniss, p.100, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, New York, NY, 1999, During his tenure at West Point, Blaik coached three Heisman trophy winners, Doc Blanchard in 1945, Glenn Davis in 1946 and Pete Dawkins in 1958, as well as a total of 11 Hall of Fame players. Twenty of his former assistant coaches became head coaches in their own right: Paul Amen, George Blackburn, Chief Boston, Eddie Crowder, Paul Dietzel, Bobby Dobbs, Sid Gillman, Jack Green, Andy Gustafson, Dale Hall, Tom Harp, Herman Hickman, Stu Holcomb, Frank Lauterbur, Vince Lombardi, John Sauer, Richard Voris, Murray Warmath, Bob Woodruff, and Bill Yeoman. Legendary fighter pilot Colonel Robin Olds also served as an assistant coach to Blaik. Dietzel, while at LSU, and Murray Warmath, while at Minnesota, won national championships as head coaches. Gillman, while head coach of the San Diego Chargers won an AFL championship. Lombardi, as head coach of the Green Bay Packers, won five NFL titles and the first two Super Bowls. During Blaik's tenure, the Army team adopted the nicknames \\"Black Knights\\" and \\"Black Knights of the Hudson\\", which has now come to refer to all intercollegiate athletic teams at West Point. Among his West Point players, Blaik was known for being a stern and disciplined coach. They nicknamed him \\"The Colonel.\\" Later life and death Red Blaik's tombstone at West Point Blaik resigned as head football coach of Army on January 13, 1959 to become a vice president at the Avco Corporation. In 1964, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. His alma mater, Miami University honored him by induction into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969. Blaik received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Blaik died in 1989 at age 92 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. On September 25, 1999, the football field at West Point's Michie Stadium was named Blaik Field in his honor. Portrayal in media In 2005, ESPN produced a television film called Code Breakers about the honor code scandal that plagued Blaik's 1951 team. In the film, Blaik is portrayed by actor Scott Glenn.

In economics, this type of behavior is called \\"free riding\\" and is associated with the free rider problem. The term originated in the bulletin board system era, when it referred to users that would download files and upload nothing in return. Depending on context, leeching does not necessarily refer to illegal use of computer resources, but often instead to greedy use according to etiquette: to wit, using too much of what is freely given without contributing a reasonable amount back to the community that provides it. The word is also used without any pejorative connotations, simply meaning to download large sets of information: for example the offline reader Leech, the Usenet newsreader NewsLeecher, the audio recording software SoundLeech, or LeechPOP, a utility to download attachments from POP3 mailboxes. The name derives from the leech, an animal that sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed. Other terms are used, such as \\"freeloader\\", \\"mooch\\" and \\"sponge\\", but leech is the most commonly used.  Examples  * Wi-Fi leeches attach to open wireless networks without the owner's knowledge in order to access the Internet. One example of this is someone who connects to a café's free wireless service from their car in the parking lot in order to download large amounts of data. See Piggybacking (Internet access) * Direct linking (or hot-linking) is a form of bandwidth leeching that occurs when placing an unauthorized linked object, often an image, from one site in a web page belonging to a second site (the leech). * In most P2P-networks, leeching can be defined as behavior consisting of downloading more data, over time, than the individual is uploading to other clients, thus draining speed from the network. The term is used in a similar way for shared FTP directories. Mainly, leeching is taking without giving. * Claiming credit for, or offering for sale, freely available content created and uploaded by others to the Internet (Plagiarism/Copyfraud)  Gaming  In games (whether a traditional tabletop RPG, LARPing, or even MMORPG) the term \\"leech\\" is given to someone who avoids confrontation and sits out while another player fights and gains experience for the person, or \\"leecher\\", who is avoiding confrontation. * In online multi-player games, \\"to leech\\" generally means that a player be present and qualify for the presentation of a reward of some sort, without contributing to the team effort needed to earn that reward. Although in the past the term \\"leeching\\" has been applied to a player gaining any benefit due solely to the efforts of others, the term is now most often limited to players that gain experience without meaningful contribution. However, while this usually carries negative connotations, this is not always the case; for instance, in MMOs where power leveling is possible, a higher level player may deliberately consent to a lower leveled player gaining experience without assisting, usually due to the danger to the lower leveled player. In situations where the amount of assistance the lower level player can provide is negligible (as is often the case when being Power Leveled, due to the disparity between target mobs and the player), a higher level player may deliberately encourage the lower level player to \\"leech\\" to avoid wasted time spent protecting the lower level player that could otherwise be directed towards more quickly accomplishing the goal of earning experience points. However, this is usually an arrangement between friends or guild-mates, and unsolicited requests to \\"leech\\" experience off of a higher level player is often considered extremely rude. * In popular MMORPG's the alternative way to refer to a \\"leecher\\" (especially one that is \\"leeching\\" items, as opposed to experience) has arisen as being \\"Ninja\\" (referring to the notional lightning reflexes needed to claim the reward between its appearance and its retrieval by the more deserving player). This can be used as either a noun (\\"Player One is a loot ninja!\\") or a verb (\\"Player One keeps ninja'ing all the drops!\\"). However, a \\"ninja\\" may not necessarily be \\"leeching\\", in that they do sometimes contribute to the goal, \\"ninja\\" more applies towards a player claiming an item unfairly, either because the group agreed to pass the item to a particular player in advance, or by taking the item before the group can determine which player gets the item fairly through whichever process the group agreed upon (usually rolling for it, which is simulated in many MMOs through a \\"/random\\" or \\"/roll\\" command). * This is different from \\"killstealing\\" where a player uses an attack at the right moment to kill an enemy and take the experience benefit (XP), which may benefit the player or not. In some games, XP is granted to the person who deals a final shot to an enemy, or to who deals a significant amount of damage regardless of who hit it last. Killstealing can in this fashion be applied as a reverse leeching: it prevents another player from gaining XP at all regardless of their effort.  Prevention  * Wi-Fi networks can implement various authentication and access control technologies in order to prevent leeching. The most common are client MAC address authorization tables (deprecated due to insecurity), Wired Equivalent Privacy (deprecated due to insecurity), and Wi-Fi Protected Access. * Bandwidth leeching can be prevented by running an anti-leeching script on the website's server. It can automatically ban IPs that leech, or can redirect them to faulty files.  P2P networks  Amongst users of the BitTorrent file distribution protocol and common P2P networks, such as the eDonkey network or Gnutella2, a leech is a user who disconnects as soon as they have a complete copy of a particular file, while minimizing or completely suppressing data upload. However, on most BitTorrent tracker sites, the term leecher is used for all users who are not seeders (which means they do not have the complete file yet). As BitTorrent clients usually begin to upload files almost as soon as they have started to download them, such users are usually not freeloaders (people who don't upload data at all to the swarm). Therefore, this kind of leeching is considered to be a legitimate practice. Reaching an upload/download ratio of 1:1 (meaning that the user has uploaded as much as they downloaded) in a BitTorrent client is considered a minimum in the etiquette of that network. In the terminology of these BitTorrent sites, a leech becomes a seeder (a provider of the file) when they finished downloading and continues to run the client. They will remain a seeder until the file is removed or destroyed (settings enable the torrent to stop seeding at a certain share ratio, or after X hours have passed seeding). The so-called bad leechers are those running specially modified clients which avoid uploading data. This has led to the development of a multitude of technologies to ban such misbehaving clients. For example, on BitTorrent, most private trackers do keep track of the amount of data a client uploads or downloads to avoid leeching, while on real P2P networks systems like DLP (Dynamic Leecher Protection) (eMule Xtreme Mod, eDonkey network) or uploader rewarding (Gnutella2) have been brought in place. Note that BitTorrent is not a P2P network, it is only a P2P file distribution system. Leeching is often seen as a threat to peer-to- peer sharing and as the direct opposite of the practice of seeding. But with rising downloads, uploads are still guaranteed, although few contributors in the system account for most services.Yang, S., Jin, H., Liao, X., Yao, H., Huang, Q., Tu, X. (2009).

He was the first one to specifically use the surname \\"Spencer-Churchill\\"; Churchill was the name of the first Duke. Background and education Spencer-Churchill was the eldest son of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, and Lady Caroline Russell, daughter of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. Francis Spencer, 1st Baron Churchill, was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton between 1776 and 1783 and at Christ Church, Oxford between 1784 and 1786, where he graduated on 9 December 1786 as a Bachelor of Arts, later proceeding automatically to Master of Arts. He was later given the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (D.C.L.) from the University on 20 June 1792.thepeerage.com George Spencer- Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough Career Lord Blandford represented Oxfordshire in parliament as a Whig between 1790 and 1796 and Tregony as a Tory between 1802 and 1806. From 1804 to 1806 he served under William Pitt the Younger as a Lord of the Treasury. The latter year he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's barony of Spencer of Wormleighton. During this time, he lived in Berkshire, at Remenham and Hurst. From 1798, he resided at Whiteknights Park at Earley, near Reading, where he became famous for his extravagant collecting of antiquities, especially books. He was invested as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA) on 8 December 1803. Although the Marquess was born and baptised with the name of George Spencer, soon after succeeding to the Dukedom of Marlborough, he had it legally changed on 26 May 1817 to George Spencer-Churchill. This illustrious name did not, however, save him from his mounting debts and his estates were seized and his collections sold. He retired to Blenheim Palace where he lived the remainder of his life off a small annuity granted to the first Duke by Queen Anne.The Profligate Duke The diarist Harriet Arbuthnot wrote one of her most scathing comments about the Duke following a visit to Blenheim in 1824: Family Marlborough married Lady Susan Stewart (1767–1841), daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway, on 15 September 1791.

They were the backfield of Notre Dame's 1924 football team. The players that made up this group were Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden. In 1924, a nickname coined by sportswriter Grantland Rice and the actions of a student publicity aide transformed the Notre Dame backfield of Stuhldreher, Crowley, Miller, and Layden into one of the most noted groups of collegiate athletes in football history, the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame. Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim Crowley, right halfback Don Miller, and fullback Elmer Layden had run rampant through Irish opponents' defenses since coach Knute Rockne devised the lineup in 1922 during their sophomore season. During the three-year tenure of the Four Horsemen, Notre Dame lost only two games; one each in 1922 and 1923, both to Nebraska in Lincoln before packed houses. Naming The foursome needed some help from Grantland Rice, a sportswriter for the former New York Herald Tribune, to achieve football immortality. After Notre Dame's 13–7 upset victory over a strong Army team, on October 18, 1924, Rice penned \\"the most famous football lead of all-time\\":Maraniss, 1999 pg. 35 > Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In > dramatic lore their names are Death, Destruction, Pestilence, and Famine. > But those are aliases. Their real names are: Stuhldreher, Crowley, Miller > and Layden. They formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which > another fighting Army team was swept over the precipice at the Polo Grounds > this afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down upon the bewildering > panorama spread out upon the green plain below. George Strickler, then Rockne's student publicity aide and later sports editor of the Chicago Tribune, made sure the name stuck. He had pitched the idea out loud at the halftime of the Army game in the press box as a tie in to the 1921 Rudolph Valentino movie The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Dufresne, Chris - When they were riding high. Los Angeles Times, October 2, 2007 After the team arrived back in South Bend, he posed the four players, dressed in their uniforms, on the backs of four horses from a livery stable in town. The wire services picked up the now-famous photo, and the legendary status of the Four Horsemen was assured. \\"At the time, I didn't realize the impact it would have,\\" Crowley said later. \\"But the thing just mushroomed. After the splurge in the press, the sports fans of the nation got interested in us along with other sportswriters. Our record helped, too. If we'd lost a couple. I don't think we would have been remembered.\\" After that win over Army, Notre Dame's third straight victory of the young season, the Irish were rarely threatened the rest of the year. A 27–10 win over Stanford in the 1925 Rose Bowl gave Rockne and Notre Dame the national championship and a 10–0 record. As it usually is with legends, the Four Horsemen earned their spot in gridiron history. Although none of the four stood taller than six feet or weighed more than 162 pounds, they played 30 games as a unit and only lost to one team, Nebraska, twice. They played at a time when there were no separate offensive and defensive teams. All players had to play both sides. Once a player left the field, he could not come back into the game. Backgrounds Stuhldreher, a 5-7, 151-pounder from Massillon, Ohio, was a self-assured leader who could throw accurately, return punts, and block. He emerged as the starting signal caller four games into his sophomore season in 1922. Crowley, who came to Notre Dame in 1921 from Green Bay, Wisconsin, stood 5-11 and weighed 162 pounds. Known as \\"Sleepy Jim\\" for his drowsy-eyed appearance, Crowley outmaneuvered many defenders with his shifty ball carrying. Miller, a native of Defiance, Ohio, followed his three brothers to Notre Dame. At 5-11, 160 pounds, he proved to be the team's breakaway threat. According to Rockne, Miller was the greatest open-field runner he ever coached. Layden, the fastest of the quartet, became the Irish defensive star with his timely interceptions and handled the punting chores. The 6-foot, 162-pounder from Davenport, Iowa, boasted excellent speed in the 40-yard dash. Later lives After graduation, the lives of the Four Horsemen took similar paths. All began coaching careers, with three of the four occupying top positions. As players, the four reunited for one game for the Hartford Blues in 1925 (Stuldreher was already playing for the team that year); the Blues, however, lost 13–6 to the Cleveland Bulldogs. Two of the four, Layden and Stuhldreher, were the namesakes of the professional Brooklyn Horsemen team for whom they played in 1926. Layden coached at his alma mater for seven years and compiled a 47–13–3 record. He also served as athletic director at Notre Dame and later as commissioner of the National Football League. After a business career in Chicago, Layden died in 1973 at the age of 70. Crowley started as an assistant coach at the University of Georgia. He quickly moved to head coaching positions at Michigan State University and Fordham University, where his famed line, the \\"Seven Blocks of Granite,\\" included Vince Lombardi. His Fordham teams played in the Cotton Bowl Classic and Sugar Bowl. His overall record was 78–21–10. Crowley also served as commissioner of the All-America Football Conference. He later entered business in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The last surviving Horseman, Crowley died in 1986 at the age of 83. Stuhldreher, who died in 1965 at the age of 63, was the head football coach for 11 years at Villanova University, then became athletic director and football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He later worked for U.S. Steel. Miller left coaching after four years at Georgia Tech and began practicing law in Cleveland. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for Northern Ohio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Miller died in 1979 at the age of 77. All four players were elected to the College Football Hall of Fame — Layden in 1951, Stuhldreher in 1958, Crowley in 1966, and Miller in 1970. In 1998, the United States Postal Service honored the Four Horsemen with their own stamp as part of 15 commemorative postage stamps saluting \\"The Roaring Twenties\\" which was part of their Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series. The Seven Mules After the Horsemen got their name, the Notre Dame line was nicknamed the \\"Seven Mules\\" to emphasize their crucial but less glamorous function. Two members of the line are also in the College Football Hall of Fame. Adam Walsh, from Hollywood, California, was the starting center and team captain. In later years, he coached at Santa Clara University and Bowdoin College and for the Cleveland/Los Angeles Rams. Walsh died in 1985. Edgar Miller was a tackle from Canton, Ohio. He later coached at the United States Naval Academy and died in 1991. Thus, a total of six members of the 1924 Notre Dame team have been elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. Yet another of the \\"Mules\\" was Joe Bach who went on to a coaching career that included two stints as head coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates/Steelers. Another Mule was George Vergara who later played for the Green Bay Packers and his career ended with a neck injury. Later he became the Mayor of New Rochelle, New York.

Excerpt from Dictionary of Literary Biography, accessed July 9, 2010. is an American poet and translator, an authority on Vietnamese literature.The Poetry Center at Smith College: John Balaban , accessed September 19, 2007. Biography Balaban was born in Philadelphia to Romanian immigrant parents, Phillip and Alice Georgies Balaban. He obtained a B.A. with highest honors in English from Pennsylvania State University in 1966. A Woodrow Wilson Fellowship that he received in his senior year at Penn State allowed him to study English literature at Harvard University, where he received his A.M. Balaban was a conscientious objector in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In a moment at Harvard which he writes about in his memoir Remembering Heaven's Face, he petitioned his draft board to allow him to drop his student deferment to go to Vietnam with the International Volunteer Services, where he taught at a university until it was bombed in the Tet Offensive. He was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel and evacuated; after his recovery, he continued his alternative service and returned to Vietnam with the Committee of Responsibility to treat war-injured children. Balaban receiving the Medal for the Cause of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Viet Nam from the Vietnam Ministry of Culture on December 12, 2008 He left Vietnam in 1969, subsequently testifying on civilian casualties before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee chaired by Senator Ted Kennedy. In 1971–72, as the war continued, he returned once again to tape, transcribe, and translate the sung oral poetry known as ca dao, resulting in his Ca Dao Viet Nam: Vietnamese Folk Poetry Balaban's first published collection of his own verse, After Our War (1974), was a Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets and nominated for the National Book Award. In 1999, he became a founder of the Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation, which for twenty years led the digital preservation of ancient texts in Vietnam. In 2000, he released Spring Essence, a collection of poems by Hồ Xuân Hương, an 18th-century poet and the preeminent woman poet of Vietnam. The book included English translations and versions in both the current Vietnamese alphabet and the historical Chữ Nôm writing system. Balaban has written poetry beyond his experiences in Vietnam. His collection Locusts at the Edge of Summer: New and Selected Poems won the 1998 William Carlos Williams Award.Interview and information from Barns & Noble, accessed September 19, 2007. His Words for My Daughter was a National Poetry Series Selection. In 2006, Path, Crooked Path was named an Editor's Choice by Booklist and Best Book of Poetry by Library Journal. In 2008, he was awarded a medal of appreciation from the Ministry of Culture of Vietnam for his leadership in the restoration of the ancient text collection at the National Library.

It is a bright yellow crystalline solid that becomes brown upon decomposition in air. Structure and properties The four phosphorus atoms are at the corners of a tetrahedron surrounding the palladium(0) center. This structure is typical for four-coordinate 18 e− complexes. The corresponding complexes Ni(PPh3)4 and Pt(PPh3)4 are also well known. Such complexes reversibly dissociate PPh3 ligands in solution, so reactions attributed to Pd(PPh3)4 often in fact arise from Pd(PPh3)3 or even Pd(PPh3)2. Preparation Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) was first prepared by Lamberto Malatesta et al. in the 1950s by reduction of sodium chloropalladate with hydrazine in the presence of the phosphine. It is commercially available, but can be prepared in two steps from Pd(II) precursors: :PdCl2 \\\\+ 2 PPh3 → PdCl2(PPh3)2 :PdCl2(PPh3)2 \\\\+ 2 PPh3 \\\\+ N2H4 → Pd(PPh3)4 \\\\+ N2 \\\\+ 2 N2H5Cl Both steps may be carried out in a one-pot reaction, without isolating and purifying the PdCl2(PPh3)2 intermediate. Reductants other than hydrazine can be employed. The compound is sensitive to air, but can be purified by washing with methanol to give the desired yellow powder. It is usually stored cold under argon. Applications Pd(PPh3)4 is widely used as a catalyst for palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. Prominent applications include the Heck reaction, Suzuki coupling, Stille coupling, Sonogashira coupling, and Negishi coupling. These processes begin with two successive ligand dissociations followed by the oxidative addition of an aryl halide to the Pd(0) center: :Pd(PPh3)4 \\\\+ ArBr → PdBr(Ar)(PPh3)2 \\\\+ 2 PPh3 References Category:Palladium compounds Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Triphenylphosphine complexes Category:Homogeneous catalysis ","title":"Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)"},{"id":"2349903","text":"Jason Matthew Daniel Pontin (born 11 May 1967) is an English journalist and was the editor in chief and publisher of MIT Technology Review, a role he held from 2005 to 2017. Early life and education Pontin was born on 11 May 1967 in London, to a British father, Anthony Charles Pontin, a businessman, and a South African mother, Elaine Howells, an actress. He was raised in Northern California but educated in England, at Harrow School and Oxford University. Career From 1996 to 2002, Pontin was the editor of Red Herring, a business and technology publication. From 2002 to 2004, he was the editor of The Acumen Journal, a now-defunct magazine he founded about the life sciences. He was hired as the editor of Technology Review in July 2004, and in August 2005 was named publisher. Pontin engaged in what The Boston Globe has described as a \\"strategic overhaul\\" of Technology Review, whose goal is to make the magazine into a largely electronic publishing company. In October 2012, he renamed the organization MIT Technology Review and relaunched it as a \\"digital-first enterprise\\". AdWeek commented that \\"Pontin and MIT Technology Review could set the standard for the transition to a digital future for legacy media.\\" Pontin was Chairman of the MIT Enterprise Forum, MIT's global organization of technology entrepreneurs. Pontin has written for national and international magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times, The Economist, The Financial Times, The Boston Globe, The Believer Magazine, and Wired. He writes a bi-weekly column for Wired in the publication's \\"IDEAS\\" channel and contributes to the magazine. In February 2013, he delivered a TED Talk in Long Beach, California, \\"Can Technology solve our big problems?\\" In 2015, under Pontin's leadership, MIT Technology Review launched a conference called Solve that addressed many of the questions raised in his 2013 TED Talk. The 2015 event convened leaders in philanthropy, business, technology, and policy to discuss global challenges in health care, education, resources, and infrastructure. Solve evolved into MIT's open innovation platform: today, Solve solicits solutions to a series of new challenges every year, and hosts events in different cities where innovators present their ideas. He has engaged in a long-running dispute with Aubrey de Grey regarding de Grey's assertion that it will be possible to reverse ageing. Pontin has written that he considers some of de Grey's strategies to be pseudo-science; de Grey has responded vigorously, and the dispute has persisted for at least a decade.

The museum's mission is to preserve and share the culture and history of the canoe.  History  It was founded as the Kanawa Museum, which was also called the Kanawa International Collection of Canoes, Kayaks and Rowing Craft, in 1957 by Kirk Wipper at Camp Kandalore, north of Minden, Ontario, when a friend presented Professor Wipper with a dugout made circa 1890. Over the years, the collection grew. It was housed inadequately in wooden buildings at Kandalore, and by the late 1980s it was becoming clear that a new home would be needed. Wipper transferred control of his historic collection in 1994 to the organization now called the Canadian Canoe Museum. The museum now holds the largest collection of its kind, with more than 600 canoes and kayaks, and a thousand related artifacts. The museum opened its doors to the public at its new location on Canada Day in 1997. In May 2006, Prince Andrew, as a member of the Canadian Royal Family, accepted the invitation to become the royal patron of the museum, and visited on May 11 to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He also donated three canoes, originally built in the area of Peterborough, and gifted to the Royal Family between 1947 and 1981, on long-term loan. Exhibits Exhibition of the Canadian Canoe Museum The Canadian Canoe Museum's exhibits explore how the canoe defines the Canadian character and spirit. As well as the canoe collection, the museum features a dramatic waterfall, and a traditional Mi'kmaq wigwam where visitors can hear creation stories. Visitors can also try their hand at building a birch bark canoe in the Preserving Skills Gallery, plan a prospecting expedition like in the gold rush days, feel what it was like to be a voyageur during the fur trade era, and enjoy the cottaging lifestyles of the early 20th century. A notable exhibit started in October 2001, when the museum gained further prominence with the launch of Reflections: The Land, the People and the Canoe. This landmark exhibit featured Pierre Trudeau's famous buckskin jacket and birch bark canoe on public display for the first time, along with the personal artifacts of other significant paddlers, including Bill Mason, Victoria Jason and Eric Morse. Visiting information The Canadian Canoe Museum is located on 910 Monaghan Road, Peterborough. The museum is fully wheelchair accessible, and parking is free. The museum's hours and admission rates are available on its website.

It is also known as [8]annulene. This polyunsaturated hydrocarbon is a colorless to light yellow flammable liquid at room temperature. Because of its stoichiometric relationship to benzene, COT has been the subject of much research and some controversy. Unlike benzene, C6H6, cyclooctatetraene, C8H8, is not aromatic, although its dianion, (cyclooctatetraenide), is. Its reactivity is characteristic of an ordinary polyene, i.e. it undergoes addition reactions. Benzene, by contrast, characteristically undergoes substitution reactions, not additions. History 1,3,5,7-Cyclooctatetraene was initially synthesized by Richard Willstätter in Munich in 1905 using pseudopelletierine as the starting material and the Hofmann elimination as the key transformation: :Willstätter's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene (1905). Willstätter noted that the compound did not exhibit the expected aromaticity. Between 1939 and 1943, chemists throughout the US unsuccessfully attempted to synthesize COT. They rationalized their lack of success with the conclusion that Willstätter had not actually synthesized the compound but instead its isomer, styrene. Willstätter responded to these reviews in his autobiography, where he noted that the American chemists were 'untroubled' by the reduction of his cyclooctatetraene to cyclooctane (a reaction impossible for styrene). During World War 2, Walter Reppe at BASF Ludwigshafen developed a simple, one-step synthesis of cyclooctatetraene from acetylene, providing material identical to that prepared by Willstätter. Any remaining doubts on the accuracy of Willstätter's original synthesis were resolved when Arthur C. Cope and co- workers at MIT reported, in 1947, a complete repetition of the Willstätter synthesis, step by step, using the originally reported techniques. They obtained the same cyclooctatetraene, and they subsequently reported modern spectral characterization of many of the intermediate products, again confirming the accuracy of Willstätter's original work. Structure and bonding Cyclooctatetraene in its native \\"tub-shaped\\" conformation. Early studies demonstrated that COT did not display the chemistry of an aromatic compound. Then, early electron diffraction experiments concluded that the C-C bond distances were identical. However, X-ray diffraction data from H. S. Kaufman demonstrated cyclooctatetraene to adopt several conformations and to contain two distinct C–C bond distances. This result indicated that COT is an annulene with fixed alternating single and double C-C bonds. In its normal state, cyclooctatetraene is non-planar and adopts a tub conformation with angles C=C−C = 126.1° and C=C−H = 117.6°. The point group of cyclooctatetraene is D2d. In its planar transition state, the D4h transitional state is more stable than the D8h transitional state due to the Jahn–Teller effect. Synthesis Richard Willstätter's original synthesis (4 consecutive elimination reactions on a cyclooctane framework) gives relatively low yields. Reppe's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene, which involves treating acetylene at high pressure with a warm mixture of nickel cyanide and calcium carbide, was much better, with chemical yields near 90%: :Reppe's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene COT can also be prepared by photolysis of barrelene, one of its structural isomers, the reaction proceeding via another isolable isomer, semibullvalene. COT derivatives can also be synthesised by way of semibullvalene intermediates. In the sequence illustrated below, octaethylcyclooctatetraene (C8Et8) is formed by thermal isomerisation of octaethylsemibullvalene, itself formed by copper(I) bromide mediated cyclodimerisation of 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadiene. :Synthesis of octaethylsemibullvalene from 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene and its thermal isomerisation to octaethylcyclooctatetraene Because COT is unstable and easily forms explosive organic peroxides, a small amount of hydroquinone is usually added to commercially available material. Testing for peroxides is advised when using a previously opened bottle; white crystals around the neck of the bottle may be composed of the peroxide, which may explode when mechanically disturbed. Natural occurrence Cyclooctatetraene has been isolated from certain fungi. Reactions The π bonds in COT react as usual for olefins, rather than as aromatic ring systems. Mono- and polyepoxides can be generated by reaction of COT with peroxy acids or with dimethyldioxirane. Various other addition reactions are also known. Furthermore, polyacetylene can be synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of cyclooctatetraene. COT itself—and also analogs with side- chains—have been used as metal ligands and in sandwich compounds. Cyclooctatetraene also undergoes rearrangement reactions to form aromatic ring systems. For instance, oxidation with aqueous mercury(II) sulfate forms phenylacetaldehyde and photochemical rearrangement of its mono-epoxide forms benzofuran. Cyclooctatetraenide as a ligand and ligand precursor Ball-and- stick model of COT2− COT readily reacts with potassium metal to form the salt K2COT, which contains the dianion . The dianion is planar, octagonal, and aromatic with a Hückel electron count of 10. Cyclooctatetraene forms organometallic complexes with some metals, including yttrium, lanthanides, and actinides.JST Nanostructed Materials Project Highlights – Prof. Nakajima's Presentation The sandwich compound uranocene (U(COT)2) features two ῃ8-COT ligands. In bis(cyclooctatetraene)iron (Fe(COT)2) one COT is ῃ6 and the other is ῃ4. (Cyclooctatetraene)iron tricarbonyl features ῃ4-COT. The room- temperature 1H NMR spectra of these iron complexes are singlets, indicative of fluxionality. Uranocene, a sandwich compound containing two COT2− rings. Cyclooctatetraene is chlorinated to give a [4.2.0]-bicyclic compound, which reacts further with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate in a Diels-Alder reaction (DA). Retro-DA at 200 °C releases cis-dichlorocyclobutene. This compound reacts with diiron nonacarbonyl to give cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl. :Cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl Synthesis See also * Cyclobutadiene * Pentalene * Barrelene, structural isomer of cyclooctatetraene * Heptafulvene, structural isomer of cyclooctatetraene * Semibullvalene * Benzene References Category:Annulenes Category:Molecular electronics Category:Antiaromatic compounds Category:Eight-membered rings ","title":"Cyclooctatetraene"},{"id":"2349950","text":"Dance Factory is a children's television show which ran for nine weeks from March to May 2005 at 10.30am on BBC One.

The aim of the show is to pair six non-dancers with experts their own age in Bhangra, Irish dancing, pop, tap dancing, hip hop and musical theatre styles. The contestants are drawn from all over the UK, and auditions were held in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Belfast. The next phase of the show sees the experts teaching their new partners how to dance, and also saw them meeting some showbiz stars to pick up tips along the way. These included Michael Flatley, of Riverdance fame; Rio Ferdinand, the England and Manchester United star; Denise Lewis, Olympic gold medallist (also seen in Strictly Come Dancing) and the cast of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in London's West End. After six weeks of intense training and rehearsal, the contestants are thrust into live semi-finals, each of which saw one pair eliminated from the competition by CBBC viewers. The musical theatre pair of Stacey and Josh were eliminated first, followed by Teejay and Tom, the Bhangra pair, the week after.

It is located 1 km south of the town of Amble. Radcliffe was a mining community, once home to over 700 people. A colliery was worked here until 1892, when a fault in the seam, then fire and flooding, made coal extraction uneconomical. New pit shafts were sunk nearby at Newburgh and later at Hauxley, but flooding remained a problem with the pits in this area.Stewart, E. (2001), The Three Villages, The Amble Social History Group Through much of the 19th and early to mid-20th century, the name of the settlement included the word Terrace - \\"Radcliffe Terrace, Hauxley\\" giving the erroneous impression that it was part of Hauxley (or another local town); despite this, it was an independent (and somewhat isolated) settlement. The first word can be found spelled with many variations, even relatively recently: Ratliff, Radcliffe, Ratcliffe, Ratcliff, and Radcliff (and possibly others). By the mid-twentieth century, the surviving pits in this area of Northumberland were also becoming uneconomical to run, especially when compared to extraction using opencast mining techniques. The last shift worked underground at Radcliffe was on 2 February 1962. In 1965 plans were drawn up to opencast mine the coal seam beneath Radcliffe and Newbrough. The aging, and somewhat run-down, colliery-owned housing stock of the village was demolished in 1971 to allow for opencast operations. The inhabitants that had not already moved voluntarily to take advantage of better housing, were relocated to Amble, onto an estate named the Radcliffe estate. Various streets in this town, such as Dandsfield Square, an award-winning project when first built , are named after the demolished streets of Radcliffe. As of 2009, opencast mining continues in the area, but the mining operations at Radcliffe have ceased, and the land returned to agriculture, and turned over to a nature reserve at Hauxley. Little is now visible at the site of the village - a farm, a few private houses, a mechanic's workshop, and the old sports pavilion survived the demolition. The workshop was the site of Craiggs' Bus Garage, and has re-opened as a repair workshop specialising in agricultural machinery. The house opposite was the home of Charlie Nyberg, who ran a newsagency and barbershop from there. This house, built circa 1960, replaced the previous house and Post Office, demolished for road widening. At the nature reserve, the footings of some features (paths, picnic area, etc.) are partially made with bricks, some of which show the imprint of Radcliff (many collieries included a brickworks). Some newer homes have also been built along the A1068 Amble to Ashington road. On Sunday, 15 February 1942, at 8:22 pm, a landmine was dropped on Radcliffe by a German aeroplane being chased by an RAF fighter plane. Three houses, a school, and a church were demolished. Three members of the Craiggs' extended family were killed, and several others injured. Casualties would have been much higher if the service in the church had not finished shortly before, and the congregation dispersed. The Radcliffe War Memorial, erected in 1928 for the First World War, and with an additional roll of honour added for the fallen of the Second World War, was removed from Radcliffe and relocated to Amble, opposite the Amble Clock Tower Memorial in the Town Square. The original location can still be seen at the west side of the A1068 to the south of the village, where the surrounding wrought iron railings remain.http://www.newmp.org.uk/article.php?categoryid=100&articleid;=86  Governance  Radcliffe is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon- Tweed.

The athletes battle to stay on the log by sprinting, kicking the log, and using a variety of techniques as they attempt to cause the opponent to fall off. Two flannel-clad lumberjacks are trying to balance a floating log Log sizes There are four different sizes of logs currently used in competitions, though there are many other custom sizes used in training. Each log size has a unique number and color associated with it. In the United States, the dimensions of the logs are standardized by the United States Log Rolling Association (USLRA) while CAN-LOG (Canadian Logger Sports Association) standardizes the sizes in Canada. =USLRA professional men sizes= * I Log - 15 inches in diameter and long. * II Log - 14 inches in diameter and long. * III Log - 13 inches in diameter and long. * IV Log - 12 inches in diameter and long. =USLRA professional women sizes= * II Log - 14 inches in diameter and long. * III Log - 13 inches in diameter and long. * IV Log - 12 inches in diameter and long. =USLRA amateur sizes= * I Log - 15 inches in diameter and long. * II Log - 14 inches in diameter and long. * III Log - 13 inches in diameter and long. * IV Log - 12 inches in diameter and long. * V Log (proposed) - 11 inches in diameter and long. = CAN-LOG sizes = * I Log - 17 inches in diameter and 12 or long. * II Log - 15 inches in diameter and 12 or long. * III Log - 13 inches in diameter and 12 or long. * IV Log - 12 inches in diameter and 12 or long. United States Logrolling Association The US Log Rolling Association is the national governing body of the sports of log rolling and boom running. It is the first nation member of the International Logrolling Association (ILRA). The Association is responsible for overseeing rules, regulations, and rankings, and also works to grow and promote the sports of Log Rolling and Boomrunning in the United States. CAN-LOG Can-Log was established in the late 1960s to promote the sport of logrolling in Canada, set rules and regulations, and allow for the allocation of Canadian Championship events to the participating competitions. canlog.com Rules The match begins when the whistle is blown or “Time in” is called by the head judge and continues until a fall occurs or the time limit expires (The judge may recall a quick whistle if s/he feels that the rollers did not have equal control.). The first athlete to lose contact with the log with both feet and fall off the log loses the fall. The last athlete to lose contact with the log wins the fall. For all amateur and professional divisions, matches consist of three out of five falls. Tournaments can either run with a round robin format (each athlete competes in a match against everyone in their division once) or double elimination bracket (a consolation bracket system in which rollers move higher in the competition each time they win a match or fall lower in the competition each time they lose a match).

It is often combined in art with the Adoration of the Magi, in which case it is typically just referred to by the latter title. The Annunciation to the Shepherds, when they are summoned by an angel to the scene, is a distinct subject. Biblical narrative The Adoration of the Shepherds is based on the account in the Luke 2, not reported by any other Canonical Gospel, which states that an angel appeared to a group of shepherds, saying that Christ had been born in Bethlehem, followed by a crowd of angels saying Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth to [people] of good will. This Annunciation to the shepherds forms a distinct subject in Christian art and is sometimes included in a Nativity scene as a peripheral feature (even though it occurs prior to the adoration itself), as in the 1485 scene by Domenico Ghirlandaio, where it can be seen in the upper left corner. Ghirlandaio also shows a procession of Magi about to arrive with their gifts. The shepherds are then described as hurrying to Bethlehem to visit Jesus, and making widely known what they had been told concerning him, before they finally return to their flocks. They praise God for \\"all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them,\\" (Luke 2:20). Robert Gundry notes that the statement \\"appeals to eyewitness testimony combined with heavenly revelation.\\"Robert H. Gundry, A Survey of the New Testament (4th ed., Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2003), 218. In art The scene is very commonly combined with the Adoration of the Magi, which makes for a balanced composition, as the two groups often occupy opposite sides of the image space around the central figures, and represent the theological interpretation of the episode where the two groups – Jewish and gentile – represented the peoples of the world between them. This combination is first found in the 6th century Monza ampullae made in Byzantine Palaestina Prima. In Renaissance art, drawing on classical stories of Orpheus, the shepherds are sometimes depicted with musical instruments.Earls, Irene, Renaissance Art: A topical dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, , p. 18. A charming but atypical miniature in the La Flora Hours in Naples shows the shepherds playing to the Infant Jesus, as a delighted Virgin Mary stands to one side. Many artists have depicted the Adoration of the Shepherds. Famous examples include: *Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden *Caravaggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Museo Regionale, Messina *Domenichino: Adoration of the Shepherds, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh *Giorgione, Allendale Nativity, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. *El Greco, Adoration of the Shepherds, Museo del Prado, Madrid *Le Nain brothers: Adoration of the Shepherds, National Gallery, London *Hugo van der Goes: Portinari Triptych, Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence *Lorenzo di Credi: Adoration of the Shepherds, also Uffizi *Andrea Mantegna: The Adoration of the Shepherds, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York *Edward Burne-Jones's stained- glass windows in Trinity Church, Boston *Giotto, in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua *Georges de La Tour, Louvre, Paris *Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg *Nicolas Poussin and Rembrandt, National Gallery, London ** Poussin's painting was vandalised in 2011, along with his The Adoration of the Golden Calf. *Martin Schongauer, Berlin *Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sassetti Chapel, Santa Trinita, Florence *Gerard van Honthorst, Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne Christmas carols Several well-known Christmas carols mention the adoration of the shepherds. Some of these do so along the lines of urging the listener to come to Bethlehem such as the \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\". The modern \\"Calypso Carol\\" has the lines \\"Shepherds swiftly from your stupor rise / to see the Saviour of the world,\\" and the chorus \\"O now carry me to Bethlehem.\\" \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" says, \\"Come to Bethlehem and see / Him Whose birth the angels sing.\\" \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\\" (\\"Adeste Fideles\\" in the Latin version) has a verse which runs: > See how the shepherds, Summoned to His cradle, Leaving their flocks, draw > nigh to gaze; We too will thither Bend our joyful footsteps. Other carols which mention the adoration of the shepherds include \\"Silent Night\\", \\"What Child Is This?\\", \\"Infant Holy, Infant Lowly, \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\", and \\"O Come, Little Children\\". The German carol \\"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her\\" (\\"From heaven above to earth I come\\") contains several stanzas on the subject of following the shepherds and celebrating the newborn baby. The Czech carol \\"Nesem vám noviny (\\"Come, all ye shepherds\\", in German \\"Kommet, ihr Hirten\\") concerns the adoration of the shepherds; the middle verse of Mari Ruef Hofer's English version runs: > Hasten then, hasten to Bethlehem's stall, There to see heaven descend to us > all. With holy feeling, there humbly kneeling, We will adore Him, bow down > before Him, Worship the King.

It is approximately halfway between Geneva and Nyon. Mies sits on Lake Geneva (Lac Léman), which lies to the southeast and is 410m above sea- level. The highest point of Mies is 455m above sea level. The part of Mies touching the lake measures . To the southwest lies Versoix, in the Canton of Geneva and to the northwest Chavannes-de-Bogis, which houses a major shopping mall. To the north and west lie the Communes of Tannay, Bogis-Bossey, and Coppet. Mies is separated from the neighbouring commune of Tannay by a small ravine containing a stream called le nant du Torry. Mies is one of the communes of the Canton de Vaud which are collectively known as the \\"Terre- Sainte\\". History It is thought that the name Mies comes from its location of half way (\\"mi-\\") between Geneva and Nyon, or maybe because it is halfway between Versoix and Coppet. Remains of settlements have been found all the way back to the Bronze Age, but the first documentary reference to Mies was in 1345 under the name Miez. Later on, additional ways of writing the village appeared: Miez, Mier, Myez, Myer, Myes and only in 1912 Mies. With the conquest of the Canton de Vaud (Waadt, in German) by Bern in the year 1536, the village came under the administration of the district of Nyon. Mies thus became Switzerland's border village - with France - from 1536 until the creation of the Canton of Geneva in 1815. Village center Mies Village The village of Mies is served by a number of small businesses. Amongst these can be found a general store/grocer, the post office, hairdresser, video store, pharmacy, tea-room, restaurants, doctor and dentist, hotel, bank, etc. In the commune of Mies, but not in the village centre, can be found a number of businesses mostly along the Route Suisse, which follows the lake, including restaurants, lake facilities, boat builders, and garages. The mayor's office (the mayor's proper title in Canton de Vaud is \\"syndic\\") is located in the village centre, in a fine old building which was the village school for many years. Nowadays, the children go to a new school called \\"Le Sorbier\\", which lies slightly above the village in a pleasant green area opposite the sports centre. The nearest full size shopping facilities can be found at the neighbouring village of Chavannes de Bogis, about 10 minutes drive away, where there is a major shopping complex. Recreation The playing fields of Mies include a full size football field, basketball pitch, boules (pétanque), running track, tennis courts, and children's playground with swings, climbing frames and other children's games. The clubhouse has showers and toilets, as well as a snack bar, but these facilities are generally only open when football matches are being played on the sports field. There is a polo field, Polo de Veytay, where several polo matches are played every year, such as the Geneva Polo Masters. This is part of the large agricultural and forest area known as Domaine de Veytay, in the North-West of the commune and which takes up about 40% of the area of the commune or some 150 hectares. Photos Right on the border of the commune, but on the Versoix side is the Versoix Sports Centre, which includes a swimming pool. Mies has a public beach on Lake Geneva. This is popular in the summer months and several bar-b-Qs have been set up. Photos Nature reserves The Domaine de Veytay contains a nature reserve known as la Gouille Marion covering 7 hectares. Although private land, there are no restrictions on walking through the forest, visiting a large pond, and viewing the birds from some watch-sheds in the forest. Originally la Gouille Marion was boggy marshland which became flooded in the winter. However, in 1972 l'Association pour la Protection des Bois de la Rive Droit du Lac (Society for the protection of woodlands on the north side of the lake), carried out work which gave birth to the large pond in which two small islands were built. A ditch was also constructed in order to control the level of water. A bird observatory was built to allow ornithologists to watch the birds without disturbing them. In 1973 la Gouille Marion was classified as a nature reserve and it is forbidden to leave the paths during the nesting season from 1 March to 1 August. Hunting is also forbidden and dogs must be kept on their leads. The forest and pond hold many species of birds, insects, amphibians including various frogs and toads, and mammals such as deer, wild boar and foxes which drink from the pond. Photos Mies has a second nature reserve, Les Crénées, on the lakeshore, which is also private property, but not accessible to the public. There are plenty of long winding paths through the countryside and woods, bordering on corn fields and apple orchards. Geography Mies has an area, , of . Of this area, or 33.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 32.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 34.2% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.3% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 26.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 4.1%.

The municipality was part of the Nyon District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Mies became part of the new district of Nyon.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 4 April 2011 The municipality is located on a terrace above Lake Geneva. Transportation =Rail= Mies lies on the main railway line between Geneva and Lausanne, built in 1858. The train station at Mies is served by regional trains running north to Coppet or south to Versoix and Geneva. Services run every 15 minutes on weekdays, every half-hour on Saturdays, every hour on Sundays. =Bus= The nearest public bus is the \\"V\\" Service (V for Versoix) which runs from central Geneva (Cornavin train station) to just outside Mies at the \\"Centre Sportif la Bécassière\\" (otherwise known as the Versoix Swimming Pool). It is a very pleasant walk along mainly pedestrian and cycle tracks from La Bécassière to Mies village.

His father Benjamin Silliman Sr., also a famous Yale chemist, developed the process of fractional distillation that enabled the economical production of kerosene. In 1855, Silliman Jr. wrote a report for $526.08 on Pennsylvania rock oil and its usefulness as an illuminant that convinced investors to back George Bissell's search for oil. Introduction In the 1850s the market for light-producing liquid fuels was dominated by coal oil and by an increasingly inadequate supply of whale oil. However, George Bissell, a lawyer from New York, his partner Jonathan Greenleaf Eveleth, and James Townsend, a New Haven bank president, had a revolutionary idea. They thought there was a possibility of the crude “rock oil” (now petroleum) that had been cropping up in Western Pennsylvania being used as an illuminatory substance. At the time, rock oil was nothing but a smelly hindrance to the well-diggers of the region, with some limited medicinal properties. Yet Bissell and Eveleth, after realizing how flammable the liquid was, believed there was great money to be made in producing rock oil commercially, marketed as lamp fuel and such. But they needed someone—an important, well-respected scientist—whose name they could attach to their financial venture, to research the material to find out whether or not it could be used in such a manner. They found Benjamin Silliman Jr., professor of chemistry at Yale. Chemical contribution Benjamin Silliman Jr. Benjamin Silliman's primary contribution to the chemical world, and certainly the world as a whole, involved the fractional distillation of petroleum, analyzed mainly for the purpose of its qualities of illumination. He was asked to do this as one of the most prominent chemists of his time, and his report on the subject afterwards had extremely far-reaching influences. The immensely important main idea of his report was that distilled petroleum burned far brighter than any fuel on the market, except those that were far more expensive and less efficient. His conclusion was that petroleum is “a raw material from which...they may manufacture a very valuable product.” Silliman also noted that this material was able to survive through large ranges of temperature, and the possibility of it being used as a lubricant. Impact of contribution The impact of the discovery of petroleum as a high-quality illuminator is obvious. At the time, however, Bissell and Eveleth simply brought some people together to form the “Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company”- shortly after to be renamed the “Seneca Oil Company,” after another common, regional name for petroleum. Edwin Drake was in charge of drilling the well, and after many setbacks, generally revolving around the lack of money, he struck oil in quiet, rural, Titusville, Pennsylvania on August 27, 1859. The scenery of Titusville changed almost overnight. Oil derricks and towns filled with get-rich-quick speculators filled the newly named Oil Creek. The holes were generally unremarkable, especially by the standards of today; the first probably only gathered less than 50 barrels of oil a day. However, the influence of these oil wells, and Benjamin Silliman Jr.’s report confirming the use of petroleum as an illuminant, was massive. Almost equally important in Bissell's idea and Silliman's discovery was the use of rock oil for lubrication of the many moving parts in the mechanical age soon to come. Mining consultant Silliman's fame as an oil pioneer put him in great demand as a consultant to mining companies, a line of work in which he was much less successful. His great overestimate of the ore reserves in the Emma mine near Alta, Utah contributed to a financial fiasco for British investors when the mine exhausted its ore years ahead of Silliman's prediction. He also reported very optimistically on the mines at Lake Valley, New Mexico, which were also money-losers for shareholders.Dan Plazak A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top (2006) Influenced by Benjamin Silliman Sr. was clearly the largest inspiration in Benjamin Silliman Jr.’s career. Both Sillimans were eminent chemists and professors of the subject at Yale University. The father was the first professor of chemistry at Yale in 1802, and studied the subject at the Medical College of the University of Pennsylvania. He was also professor of natural history -- which was defined as geology, mineralogy, zoology, and botany -- all of which he studied at the University of Edinburgh. His work in those areas established Yale’s rock and mineral collection as the most significant in America at the time. With his help, Yale became the foremost center of science in 19th-century America. Benjamin Silliman Sr. is considered by many to be the father of American chemistry. With the exception of Silliman Jr.’s involvement in the oil boom, there are many similarities between the careers of both Sillimans. Benjamin Silliman Jr.'s wife was a descendant of Joel Root, an early entrepreneur and supercargo on the sealing ship Huron. Root wrote a journal, A Voyage Around the World Made by Joel Root 1802-1806, later published in a limited edition of eight copies by Alice Belknap Hawkes, descendant of the Silliman, Root, and Forbes families. One of Joel Root's daughters, Charlotte Antoinette Root, was the grandmother of Susan Huldah Forbes (born on 6 March 1819 at New Haven, New Haven Co.). Susan was the daughter of William Jehiel Forbes and Charlotte Antoinette Root Forbes. Susan Huldah Forbes was the wife of Benjamin Silliman Jr. See also * The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power * The Story of Oil In Pennsylvania References *\\"Benjamin Silliman.\\" Dictionary of American Biography Base Set.

Turberville's Book of Falconry or Hawking (1575). George Turberville, or Turbervile (about 1540 - before 1597) was an English poet. Life He was the second son of Henry Turberville of Winterborne Whitechurch, Dorset, The Visitation of Dorset 1565, page 41. and nephew of James Turberville, Bishop of Exeter. The Turbervilles were an old Dorsetshire family, the inspiration for the d'Urbervilles of Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Turberville became a scholar of Winchester College in 1554, and in 1561 was made a fellow of New College, Oxford. In 1562 he began to study law in London, and gained a reputation, according to Anthony à Wood, as a poet and man of affairs. He accompanied Thomas Randolph on a special mission to Moscow to the court of Ivan the Terrible in 1568. Of his Poems describing the Places and Manners of the Country and People of Russia mentioned by Wood, only three metrical letters describing his adventures survive, and these were reprinted in Hakluyt's Voyages (1589). His Epitaphs, Epigrams, Songs and Sonnets appeared \\"newly corrected with additions\\" in 1567. In the same year he published translations of the Heroycall Epistles of Ovid, and of the Eglogs of Mantuan (Gianbattista Spagnuoli, also known as Mantuanus), and in 1568 A Plaine Path to Perfect Vertue from Dominicus Mancinus. The Book of Falconry or Hawking and the Noble Art of VenerieArchive.org (printed together in 1575) are sometimes both assigned to Turberville though the second of these is a translation by George Gascoigne from the French work La Venerie (1561) by Jacques du Fouilloux.Chass.utoronto.ca The title page of his Tragical Tales (1587), which are translations from Boccaccio and Bandello, says that the book was written at the time of the author's raging alcoholism and opiate abuse.

On 19 February 1985, the Boeing 747SP operating the flight was involved in an aircraft upset accident, following the failure of the No. 4 engine, while cruising at . The plane rolled over and plunged , experiencing high speeds and g-forces (approaching and, at one point, exceeding 5g) before the captain was able to recover from the dive, and then to divert to San Francisco International Airport. Accident N4522V, the aircraft involved in the incident, at Amsterdam in 1991 The aircraft had departed from Taipei at 16:22 local time. The accident occurred 10 hours into the flight. The Boeing 747SP-09 was northwest of San Francisco, cruising at an altitude of . The cockpit crew consisted of Captain Min-Yuan Ho, age 55, First Officer Ju-Yue Chang, age 53, Flight Engineer Kuo- Pin Wei, age 55, Relief Captain Chien-Yuan Liao, age 53, and Relief Flight Engineer Shih-Lung Su, age 41. Captain Ho had approximately 15,500 flight hours. The First Officer had more than 7,700 hours, and the Flight Engineer had approximately 15,500 hours of flight time. The accident occurred while the main crew was on duty. The sequence began with a loss of thrust in the No. 4 Engine. That engine had failed twice during previous flights (while cruising at FL 410 and 430). In each of those cases, the engine was restarted after descending to a lower altitude. The maintenance response to the logbook entries that noted the problems included engine inspection, fuel filter drainage and replacement, vane controller inspection and replacement, water drainage from Mach probes, and other filter replacements. None of those acts fixed the recurrent problem of the No. 4 engine. Diagram of aircraft roll/pitch attitudes and time from the NTSB report The flight engineer attempted to restore power to the engine, but didn't close the bleed valve, as required by the checklist procedure. After the flight engineer announced the engine had flamed out, the captain instructed him to restart it, and ordered the first officer to request clearance for a descent from FL 410 (41,000 feet). According to the flight manual, engine restart is unlikely to succeed above . The attempt failed. Meanwhile, airspeed continued to decrease, and the autopilot rolled the control wheel to the maximum left limit of 23 degrees. As the speed decreased even further, the plane began to roll to the right, even though the autopilot was maintaining the maximum left roll limit. By the time the captain disconnected the autopilot, the plane had rolled over 60 degrees to the right and the nose had begun to drop. Ailerons and flight spoilers were the only means available to the autopilot to keep the wings level as the autopilot does not connect to the rudder during normal flight. To counteract the asymmetrical forces created by the loss of thrust from the No. 4 engine, it was essential for the pilot to manually push on the left rudder. However, the captain failed to use any rudder inputs at all, before or after disconnecting the autopilot. The resulting uncontrolled flight path is depicted in the diagram. As the plane descended through clouds, the captain's attention was drawn to the attitude indicator which displayed excessive bank and pitch. Because such an attitude is highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty. Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the attitude indicators, the captain and first officer became spatially disoriented. Only after breaking through the bottom of the clouds at was the captain able to orient himself and bring the plane under control, leveling out at . They had descended in under two and a half minutes while all onboard experienced g-forces as high as 5g. The cockpit crew believed that all four engines had flamed out, but the National Transportation Safety Board found that only engine No. 4 had failed. After leveling out, the three remaining engines were supplying normal thrust. A restart attempt brought No. 4 back into use. They began climbing and reported to air traffic control \\"condition normal now\\" and continuing on to Los Angeles. They then noticed that the inboard main landing gear was down and one of the plane's hydraulic systems was empty. Because they did not have sufficient fuel to reach Los Angeles with the drag added by the landing gear, they diverted to San Francisco. An emergency was then declared and they flew straight in to the SFO airport. The plane landed without further incident. Aftermath N4522V at Tijuana International Airport in 2009 There were two serious injuries on board: a fracture and laceration of a foot, and an acute back strain requiring two days of hospitalization. The aircraft was significantly damaged by the excessive G-forces. The wings were permanently bent upwards by , the inboard main landing gear lost two actuator doors, and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling.NTSB report courtesy of University of Bielefeld – Faculty of technology html version by Hiroshi Sogame Safety Promotion Comt. All Nippon Airways Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer had been ripped off. The entire left outboard elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained. After repairs were made to the plane, it returned to service on 25 April 1985. It continued in service for nearly 12 years until it was leased to China Airlines' sister company, Mandarin Airlines, on 1 January 1997, and was in daily service for the remainder of that year. Mandarin then sent it to McCarran International Airport for storage. From April 2002 it was owned and operated by a religious organization known as Gospel to the Unreached Millions (GUM), headed by K. A. Paul, and was christened 'Global Peace One'. On 17 July 2005, the FAA suspended its operating certificate due to insufficient maintenance. , the aircraft is kept in a large hangar at General Abelardo L. Rodríguez International Airport in Tijuana, Baja California, and is reported to be in very poor condition. In its final report, the US NTSB stated \\"The Safety Board can only conclude that the captain was distracted first by the evaluation of the engine malfunction and second by his attempts to arrest the decreasing airspeed, and that, because of these distractions, he was unable to assess properly and promptly the approaching loss of airplane control. The Safety Board also concludes that the captain over-relied on the autopilot and that this was also causal to the accident since the autopilot effectively masked the approaching onset of the loss of control of the airplane.\\"https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR8603.pdf China Airlines still operates one of its scheduled Taipei-Los Angeles services as Dynasty 006, utilizing the Boeing 747-400 until late 2014, when the Boeing 777-300ER replaced it.

Pauk advocated its use in his best- selling book How to Study in College. Chapter 10: \\"The Cornell System: Take Effective Notes\\", pp. 235-277 Overview of the method 243x243px The Cornell method provides a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes. This system of taking notes is designed for a high school or college level student. There are several ways of taking notes, but one of the most common one is the \\"two column\\" notes. The student divides the paper into two columns: the note- taking column (usually on the right) is twice the size of the questions/keyword column (on the left). The student leaves five to seven lines, or about , at the bottom of the page. Notes from a lecture or teaching are written in the note-taking column; notes usually consist of the main ideas of the text or lecture, and long ideas are paraphrased. Long sentences are avoided; symbols or abbreviations are used instead. To assist with future reviews, relevant questions (which should be recorded as soon as possible so that the lecture and questions will be fresh in the student's mind) or key words are written in the key word column. These notes can be taken from any source of information, such as fiction books, DVDs, lectures, text books, etc. When reviewing the material, the student can cover the note-taking (right) column while attempting to answer the questions/keywords in the key word or cue (left) column. The student is encouraged to reflect on the material and review the notes regularly. Studies on effectiveness A study published in 2010 by Wichita State University compared two note taking methods in a secondary English classroom, and found that Cornell Note taking may be of added benefit in cases where students are required to synthesize and apply learned knowledge, while the guided notes method appeared to be better for basic recall.Jacobs, Keil. A Comparison of Two Note Taking Methods in a Secondary English Classroom Proceedings: 4th Annual Symposium: Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects [79] Conference proceedings held at the Eugene Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 25, 2008. Symposium Chair: David M. Eichhorn Another study published in the summer of 2013 found that \\"Students who were taught CN (Cornell notes) did take better notes than those who were not, but they did not have higher achievement results.\\" The study also stated that \\"Through analysis of assessment scores, I found no significant difference between the intervention and base classes on achievement.\\" Cornell note-taking can give students an effectiveness in organization of thoughts that they have been taught and give a better review in recollecting all the information that they have learned. The Cornell note taking system is not only a fast method of writing notes, but one is able to absorb the information that is given at a faster rate. This method can improve student's studying and listening skills.

They are parasites that exclusively parasitise arthropods, mainly insects. They pass from host to host as cysts in infective faeces and typically, the parasites develop in the digestive tracts of insects and interact with the intestinal epithelium using their flagellum. They display very low host-specificity and a single parasite can infect a large range of invertebrate hosts. At different points in its life-cycle, it passes through amastigote, promastigote, and epimastigote phases; the last is particularly characteristic, and similar stages in other trypanosomes are often called crithidial. The etymology of the genus name Crithidia derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \\"small grain of barley\\".  Species  * Crithidia bombi is perhaps the most well documented species and is the most prevalent parasite of bumblebees, including common species like Bombus terrestris, Bombus muscorum, and Bombus hortorum. The parasites negatively impact reproductive fitness of Bombus queens, as they affect their ovarian development as well as early colony establishment after the queens emerge from hibernation. * Crithidia mellificae is a parasite of the bee. * Crithidia brevicula might incorporate species of the genus Wallaceina (Wallaceina brevicula, W. inconstans, W. vicina, and W. podlipaevi) as suggested by molecular phylogenies based on 18S ribosomal RNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase sequences. * Other species include C. fasciculata, C. deanei, C. desouzai, C. oncopelti, C. guilhermei and C. luciliae. * C. deanei is atypical of the Crithidia genus, and it has been argued not a member of the Crithidia at all. It is not typical of trypanosomatids because of its unusual shape and it harbours endosymbiotic bacteria. C. luciliae is the substrate for the antinuclear antibody test used to diagnose lupus and other autoimmune disorders  Impact on bees  These parasites may be at least partially responsible for declining wild bee populations. They cause the bees to lose their ability to distinguish between flowers that contain nectar and those that don't. They make many mistakes by visiting nectar scarce flowers and in so doing, slowly starve to death. Commercially bred bees are used in greenhouses to pollinate plants, for example tomatoes, and these bees typically harbor the parasite, while wild bees do not. It is believed that the commercial bees transmitted the parasite to wild populations in some cases. They escape from the greenhouses through vents; a simple mesh could help prevent this.

GRAIN's work goes back to the early 1980s, when a number of activists around the world started drawing attention to the dramatic loss of genetic diversity on our farms — the very cornerstone of the world's food supply. GRAIN began doing research, advocacy and lobbying work under the auspices of a coalition of mostly European development organisations. That work soon expanded into a larger program and network that needed its own footing. In 1990, GRAIN was legally established as an independent non-profit foundation with its headquarters in Barcelona, Spain. By the mid-1990s, GRAIN reached an important turning point. They realized that they needed to connect more with the real alternatives that were being developed on the ground, in the South. Around the world, and at local level, many groups had begun rescuing local seeds and traditional knowledge and building and defending sustainable biodiversity-based food systems under the control of local communities, while turning their backs on the laboratory developed 'solutions' that had only got farmers into deeper trouble. In a radical organisational shift, GRAIN embarked on a decentralization process that brought them into closer contact with realities on the ground in the South, and into direct collaboration with partners working at that level. At the same time, they brought a number of those partners into their governing body and started regionalizing their staff pool.

Located mostly atop the Helderberg Escarpment, the park has several hiking trails that offer panoramic views of the Green Mountains in Vermont and the Taconic Mountains of the Hudson Valley. Description Entrance sign Tory cave sign The Indian Ladder Trail is open from early summer to mid- November, 8:00 am until sunset, weather permitting. All other trails are open year- round. It is located on the Helderberg Escarpment, one of the best fossil- bearing formations in the US. There are over 12 miles (20 km) of trails in the parkWeather.com - NYSPJT including the famous Indian Ladder Trail. Volleyball courts, children’s play areas and numerous cooking/barbecue areas both open and covered. Nearby at Thompson's Lake, is the Emma Treadwell Thacher Nature Center, which opened in July 2001 and has permanent and occasional displays for the public to view. The center also offers educational programs and visitor information. From the top of the escarpment, which reaches 1300 ft (400 m), there are fine views of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys as well as spectacular panoramas of the Adirondacks and Green Mountains of Vermont. History The history of the park area dates back around 400 years to a time when the trail now known as the Indian Ladder Trail was used by the Mohawk Iroquois Indians to reach the trading post run by the Dutch. Tory Cave sign It was here that in 1777, at a spot known as Tory Cave, Jacob Salsbury found refuge from settlers during the Burgoyne Invasion. The region is very well drained as all surface water runs into the limestone, making it an infertile area for farming. There are some fertile areas along the streams and Dutch settlers were brought in to the region by Patroons to whom they paid heavy rents until they freed themselves of the burden through the so-called Helderberg War (also called the Anti-Rent War) of 1839. The park is named after Albany mayor John Boyd Thacher whose widow, Emma Treadwell Thacher, donated the land in 1914.Stuberts Isle Since its opening the area was designated as a State Park. The park soon became popular with the residents of Upstate New York and many amenities were added. The purchase of 500 acres (2 km2) of land in 2004 with a State grant of $750.00 from the Environmental Protection Fund and a donation of land from the Nature Conservancy of 81 acres (320,000 m2) and the further purchase of on 3 August 2006 State Governors Office press release took the total area of the park to . It is most likely that the most prominent feature of the park, the Helderberg Escarpment got its name from the Dutch Helder meaning bright or light and Berg meaning mountain. =Park Faces Closure= In early 2010 the Governor of New York, David Paterson, announced that due to the state's massive budget deficit certain areas of the budget would have to be trimmed in order for the state to maintain proper functions. In his budget cuts, Paterson listed the Department of Parks and Recreation as one of the areas that would have funding slashed, which meant that certain parks would either be completely shut down or operated at a minimum capacity. Upon learning Paterson's intentions, the people and local governments of New York began a collaborative effort to advocate for the budget to be amended to keep John Boyd Thacher State Park, as well as many other parks and historical sites open for the enjoyment of the people. They have used Facebook, Twitter, a website and petitions as tools to help them show their discontent and become more organized in their efforts to stop the park's closure. Pressure from the public and from some members of the State Legislature resulted in a reversal of the closure proposal. State Senate leaders held a press conference on March 24, 2010 at the capitol, where they said $11.5 million would be restored to the budget to keep parks open. Trails There are over 12 miles (20 km) of trails in the park, the most famous trail being the Indian Ladder Trail. =Indian Ladder Trail= From the Indian Ladder parking lot, the visitor descends 60 ft (18 m) to the base of the escarpment via a metal staircase. From here the trail follows the base of the escarpment passing under the Minelot Falls and by the stream exiting from a small cave in the base of the rocks. This water is actually from Thompson Lake, some two miles (3 km) away, which makes its way through the porous limestone until it exits here. At the end of the trail, a second set of metal staircases take the visitor back to the top of the escarpment. The trail then continues back to the parking lot, offering excellent panoramas.

The trail runs from the George Washington Bridge in New York City and ends at Thacher Park, a distance of 347.35 miles (559.01 km) Natural history The park is designated as a wildlife preserve. There are strict regulations on the non-removal of fossils, rocks, plants, animals and birds from the park. There are also rules on the use of snowmobiles during winter and damage to the park. Breach of the regulations can lead to prosecution. =Birds= Turkey vulture soaring above the park Turkey vulture above the trees at the park In April 2004, the then New York State Governor George Pataki, announced that of Thacher Park and nearby Thompson Lake were to be turned into a bird conservation area. This conservation area was modelled on the National Audubon Society's Important Bird Areas Program which was signed into law in 1997. There are some 171 species of bird to be seen in the park, many of which are in the \\"of concern\\" status. These include:New York State Department of Environmental Conservation * Sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) * Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) * Eagle * Golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) * Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) * Hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) * Winter wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) * Black- throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) * Black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens) * Louisiana (Seiurus motacilla) and northern (Seiurus noveboracensis) waterthrushes * Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis) * Worm- eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) * Common raven (Corvus corax) * Red winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) =Plants= There is also a prolific variety of flowers, plants and trees within the park. As the park is a preserve, all species are protected within the park boundaries. The area has some of upland forest with mainly northern hardwoods predominating, but there are also *Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) *Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) *Maple *Basswood (Tilia americana) *Canadian yew (Taxus canadensis) *Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) There are several habitat types preserved in the park, including 3,700 m of calcareous cliff, bur black oak swamp, red maple swamp and emergent marsh/scrub swamp. Among flowers that can be seen are *Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) *Rock elm (Ulmus thomasii) *Snowberry(Symphoricarpos albus) *Hairy honeysuckle (Lonicera hirsuta) *Purple virgin's-bower (Clematis occidentalis) Ferns and their relations are also found in cool damp areas especially along Indian Ladder Trail. *Walking fern (Asplenium rhizophyllum)Walking fern *Purple-stemmed cliff brake (Pellaea atropurpurea)Purple stemmed cliff brake *Slender rock brake (Cryptogramma stelleri)Slender cliff brake *Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes) *Wall-rue spleenwort (Asplenium ruta-muraria) Geology The Helderberg Plateau comprises a series of limestones of early Devonian age and is one of the most fossiliferous regions in the United States. The park is a window in to New York's geological history, as the rocks here take us back in time hundreds of millions of years. In the 1800s, some of the world's most renowned pioneering geologists, such as Charles Lyell and Amos Eaton, visited this location due to its robust fossil assemblage. During this time James Hall (paleontologist), New York's first state paleontologist, frequently visited the Heldeberg Escarpment, making observations and documenting the unique fossil assemblage. In the 1930s, Winifred Goldring, New York's state paleontologist and the first female state paleontologist in the nation, continued the work of pioneering geologists and in 1933 wrote a guide to Thacher State Park that is still in use to this day. The escarpment features rocks of the Upper Silurian and Upper and Middle Ordovician ages resting below the Devonian rocks. At the base of the escarpment, the Schenectady beds are visible. The Rondout \\"waterlime\\" or dolomite overlies the Schenectady beds and is most pronounced below Minelot Falls. The escarpment consists primarily of the Manlius Formation at the base, which is overlain by the Coeymans Formation. The Manlius Formation contains stromatoporoids and abundant desiccation features, notably prism cracks. The Coeymans Formation is a more massive limestone, appears bluish in color, and contains corals and brachiopods, notably gypidula coeymansensis. The gradational contact between the Manlius and Coeymans Formations represents a transgression, or rise in sea level. Overlying the Coeymans Formation, at the top of the escarpment, the Kalkberg Formation contains brachiopods and crinoids and is interpreted as even deeper marine deposits. The New Scotland Formation contains interbedded shale and sandstone; an exposure is found in Minelot Creek, up creek of the Paint Mine parking area. The Becraft Formation overlies the New Scotland Formation and is a coarse-grained limestone with abundant crinoid debris; it is best exposed in the northern section of the park near Carrick Road, where an unconformity separates the Becraft and overlying Oriskany Sandstone. Due to its predominant limestone bedrock, the park features karst topography which includes numerous disappearing streams, caves, sinkholes, and grikes. The park contains about 40 caves. The longest documented cave is Hailes Cave. This cave has 3,700 feet of mapped passages with about 2 miles of potentially unmapped passages. The park also contains glacial features, common to this region, in the form of striated bedrock and glacial erratics.

History NFIB was founded by C. Wilson Harder in 1943 and maintained its headquarters in San Mateo, California, until 1992 when it was relocated to Nashville, TN. Harder began with a home office and sold the first memberships to his neighbours. His vision was to give the small and independent business a voice in governmental decision-making through political advocacy. Since its early history, NFIB's political agenda has been determined through a one-vote balloting process of its membership. Harder was succeeded in 1969 by his son John, who was replaced just six months later by Wilson S. Johnson.

Sloan installed a business structure with a sales manager, finance and administration directed by the CFO (both in San Mateo), and expanded the organization's presence with a public policy operation in Washington, DC. In 1983, the organization established the NFIB Member Services Corporation. The corporation is wholly owned by NFIB. Its purpose is to offer preferred-provider member benefit programs to assist members in reducing operating costs. Programs include worker's compensation insurance, commercial and personal health insurance, credit card processing, operational supplies, and discounts on commonly used business products and services. In 1992, following the death of John Sloan, Jack Faris assumed the role of president and clearly defined NFIB's role in affecting public policy at the state and federal levels through political and grassroots activism, and lobbying with lawmakers in an integrated manner. In 1992, NFIB headquarters was officially relocated to Nashville, TN. Jack Faris announced his retirement in early 2005. The board formed a search committee and selected Todd A. Stottlemyer as the fifth president of NFIB. Stottlemyer took the reins of NFIB on February 15, 2006, with a goal of improving NFIB's non-partisan reach and technology infrastructure. In February 2009, Dan Danner became the sixth president of NFIB and served until February 2016. Under Danner's leadership, NFIB proved to be a driving force in opposing major governmental regulations; in 2012 it gained historical recognition as the only business association to challenge President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as a party to the Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. Following Danner's retirement, Juanita Duggan was named president and CEO in February 2016. Duggan has taken the lead in establishing NFIB as the source for definitive information on prospective Supreme Court Justices, with regard to their stance on business issues. Recognizing the enduring impact judges can have on the business environment for independent business. NFIB has grown from Harder's for-profit entrepreneurial vision in 1943 to the non-profit national association of more than 325,000 members it is today. Politics On its website, the National Federation of Independent Business states that it is a \\"nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 1943\\" and \\"represents the consensus views of its members in Washington and all 50 state capitals.\\" Its PAC is called Save America's Free Enterprise Trust (SAFE). In 2010, 25 of its members, all Republican, were elected to the 112th Congress. A number of them, such as Rand Paul, Jeff Duncan, Paul Gosar and Kristi Noem, are affiliated with or endorsed by the Tea Party movement. Also in 2010, the NFIB became the lead plaintiff opposing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health care reform legislation. The organization joined 26 states in the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the act. The case was picked up by the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius on June 28, 2012, upholding most provisions of the act. Karl Rove's conservative Crossroads GPS PAC gave NFIB $3.7 million to help fund the court fight. Meanwhile, many other small business advocates supported PPACA. The NFIB supported the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased limitations on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from taxable income. The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent. Dan Danner, the president and CEO at that time, argued that Congress could help small business by passing the bill as it would enable small businesses to \\"plan for the future, invest in the economy and hire new workers.\\" In 2017, NFIB endorsed confirmation of SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch.http://www.nfib.com/assets/NFIB-Key-Vote-Support- of-U.S.-Supreme-Court-Nomination-Judge-Gorsuch.pdf See also * Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE, now BusinessEurope) * European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises * Canadian Federation of Independent Business References External links *National Federation of Independent Business official site * * Category:Organizations established in 1943 Category:1943 establishments in the United States Category:Tea Party movement Category:Business organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations based in Nashville, Tennessee ","title":"National Federation of Independent Business"},{"id":"2350097","text":"George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough, DCL (27 December 1793 – 1 July 1857), styled Earl of Sunderland until 1817 and Marquess of Blandford between 1817 and 1840, was a British nobleman, politician, and peer. The great-grandfather of Sir Winston Churchill, he served as Lord-Lieutenant of Oxfordshire between 1842 and 1857. Background and education Styled Earl of Sunderland from birth, he was born at Bill Hill, Hurst, Berkshire (an estate his father was renting at the time), the eldest son of George Spencer- Churchill, Marquess of Blandford (later the 5th Duke of Marlborough) and his wife, Lady Susan Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. He was educated at Eton between 1805 and 1811, and later at Christ Church, Oxford. He was also given an honorary Doctorate of Civil Laws by Oxford University on 15 June 1841.George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough Political career He became known by the courtesy title Marquess of Blandford in 1817 when his father succeeded to the dukedom. He sat as a Tory Member of Parliament for Chippenham between 1818 and 1820, and for Woodstock from 1826 to 1831, from 1832 to 1835 and from 1838 to 1840, when he succeeded to the dukedom and entered the House of Lords. In 1842, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, a post he held until his death. In parliament, Blandford became an Ultra-Tory, splitting with Wellington in opposition to Catholic emancipation. In response to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, Blandford introduced the first major reform bill in February 1830, calling for the transfer of rotten borough seats to the counties and large towns, the disfranchisement of non-resident voters, the prevention of Crown office- holders from sitting in Parliament, the payment of a salary to MPs, and the general franchise for men who owned property. He believed that somewhat more open elections could be relied upon to oppose Catholicism.Eric J.

Company history  Enom was founded in 1997 in Kirkland, Washington operating as a wholesale business, allowing resellers to sell domains and other services under their own branding. Enom also operates retail sites enomcentral.com and bulkregister.com. In May 2006, Enom was one of the original businesses that were acquired to form privately held Demand Media, headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Within Demand Media, Enom operated as a domain name registrar and as the registrar platform for its media properties, until separating from Demand Media as a brand of Rightside Group, Ltd in 2014. In July 2006, Enom bought out competitor BulkRegister. Prior to its purchase, BulkRegister was a member-supported service where clients were not resellers, but companies large enough to pay an annual membership fee to acquire low registration fees on their domain name registrations, due to the volume they potentially register. With this acquisition, Enom rose to become the second largest domain name registrar. Enom maintains BulkRegister as a separate service. In June 2016, Enom officially launched its revitalized retail experience in a major series of improvements to its developer platform. The changes affected over 14 million domains handled through Enom's channel of partners and resellers, as well as directly through the company's retail interface.

Based on the \\"right of the author\\" (droit d'auteur) instead of on \\"copyright\\", its philosophy and terminology are different from those used in copyright law in common law jurisdictions. It has been very influential in the development of copyright laws in other civil law jurisdictions, and in the development of international copyright law such as the Berne Convention. French copyright law is defined in the Code de la propriété intellectuelle, which implements European copyright law (directives). Unless otherwise stated, references to individual articles are to the Code de la propriété intellectuelle. Two distinct sets of rights are defined:. *Proprietary rights (droits patrimoniaux) *Moral rights (droits moraux) The controversial DADVSI act was due to reform French copyright law in spring 2006. This law, voted by the French Parliament on June 30, 2006, implements the 2001 Information Society Directive; however, there existed considerable differences of opinion as to how to implement the directive, in many respects. On 8 December 2005 the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris concluded that file sharing through peer- to-peer was not a criminal offense. The judgment was based on the right to \\"private copy\\" described in the which includes the use of digital media. On 7 March 2006, however, the National Assembly passed the DADVSI Act which implemented—with some modifications—the 2001 Information Society directive. The DADVSI act makes peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted works an offense. It does, however, allow for sharing of private copies of tape recording and other media.  History  1580, royal printed patent, Carnegie Library of Reims. The concept of \\"right of the author\\", which differs from Anglo-American copyright, finds its roots in the practice of printing patents and royal privileges, which first appeared in the 16th century and became common in the 17th century.Anne Latournerie, Petite histoire des batailles du droit d’auteur, Multitudes n°5, May 2001 The privilege concerned the publication rights to authors' works, rather than authors' rights per se. The first privilege granted in France was given by Henri II in 1551 to Guillaume de Morlaye, his lute player. Through this system of royal privileges, the King granted monopolies to specific editors, and implemented a system of censorship. Privileges were then very short (3 to 10 years), after which the work entered the public domain. The Moulins ordinance of 1566, the first piece of legislation to impose to librarians and editors the request of a printing patent, did not make any mention of authors. This regime privileged editors over authors, but some authors succeeded in obtaining privileges for their works. During the Muret Affair, in 1568, a lawyer named Marion pleaded for a complete and unrestricted right of property of the author on his work, and intellectual property thus entered the French jurisprudence. The practice of remunerating authors by some percentage of revenues became common during the 17th century. Playwrights, including Corneille, started to defend their rights because at that time, once a play was published, any troupe could play it without paying anything to its creator. The King thus arbitrated between the rival interests of editors and creators, giving his preference to the former. In 1761, a court decision granted to Jean de La Fontaine's granddaughters the right of ownership of La Fontaine's work, legitimized by the right of inheritance. In 1777, two other court decisions limited the publisher's right, which was restricted to the life-time of the author. Such privileges were abolished on the night of 4 August 1789, during the French Revolution. Then the National Convention enacted new legislation. A draft law was proposed by the Abbé Sieyès, which, although allegedly inspired by Condorcet's pamphlet titled Fragments sur la liberté de la presse (Fragments on liberty of the press, 1776), aimed at struggling against the spread of licentious ideas by imposing responsibility for their diffusion on authors, publishers and librarians. Sieyès and Condorcet also advanced the idea of \\"limited privilege,\\" against perpetual privileges, thus preparing the inclusion in the public domain of the works of Racine, Molière, Rousseau, Voltaire, etc. According to Anne Latournerie, \\"The first revolutionary attempt to provide to authors a legal recognition of their rights on their texts was therefore not the search of a freedom for authors, but rather the exigency of a responsibility.\\" After a controversy concerning dramatic authors, and their rebellion, led by Beaumarchais, the Chénier Act resulted on July 19, 1793. The July 14, 1866 Act extends the rights until fifty years after the death of the author. Debates continued throughout the 19th century – notably, between Lamartine and Proudhon – and the inter-war period. As early as August 1936 during the Popular Front, the Minister of National Education and of the Beaux- Arts Jean Zay proposed a draft law based on a new philosophy of the author as an \\"intellectual worker\\" (travailleur intellectuel) rather than as an \\"owner\\" (propriétaire). Jean Zay placed himself in a moral continuum with Alfred de Vigny, Augustin-Charles Renouard and Proudhon, defending the \\"spiritual interest of the collectivity\\". Article 21 of his draft divided the 50 years post-mortem protection period into two different phases, one of 10 years and the other of 40 years which established a sort of legal licence suppressing the right of exclusivity granted to a specific editor. Zay's draft project was particularly opposed by the editor Bernard Grasset, who defended the right of the editor as a \\"creator of value\\", while many writers, including Jules Romains and the president of the Société des Gens de Lettres, Jean Vignaud, supported Zay's draft. The draft did not succeed, however, in being voted in before the end of the legislature in 1939. New discussions were undertaken during the Vichy regime, initiated by a corporatist body, presided over by three jurists, François Hepp, René Dommange, and Paul Lerebours-Pigeonnières. Hepp and Dommange had been at the forefront of the battle against Jean Zay's draft law during the Popular Front. A Commission had been created in August 1944, presided over by the jurist Jean Escarra, who had co-signed in 1937 an essay with François Hepp and Jean Reault, published by Grasset, which harshly criticized Jean Zay's draft project. Extended debate in the Fourth Republic led to a modernized law along the lines of the Vichy proposals with Act No. 57-298 of March 11, 1957. Hepp proudly highlighted the continuity. According to the 1957 copyright laws, most works were protected for the duration of the author's life plus fifty years. The 1957 copyright laws were substantially modified by Act No. 85-660 of July 3, 1985, which came into force on January 1, 1986. Among other changes, this act introduced various neighbouring rights and increased the length of copyright protection for musical compositions to life of the author plus seventy years. These laws were then incorporated into the Intellectual Property Code, enacted on July 1, 1992. Act No. 97-283 of March 27, 1997, increased the copyright term of most works from life plus fifty to life plus seventy years. Because the related EU directive required implementation by July 1, 1995, the new copyright term was given retroactive effect to that date. In 1997, a court decision outlawed the publication on the Internet of Raymond Queneau's Hundred Thousand Billion Poems, an interactive poem or sort of machine to produce poems.Luce Libera, \\"12 268 millions de poèmes et quelques... De l’immoralité des droits moraux,\\" Multitudes n°5, May 2001 The court decided that the son of Queneau and the Gallimard editions possessed an exclusive and moral right on this poem, thus outlawing any publication of it on the Internet and possibility for the reader to play Queneau's interactive game of poem construction. In June 2006, the controversial DADVSI Act, which implemented (including modifications to), the 2001 Information Society directive was passed by the National Parliament.  Protected works  The criterion for protection of a work under French copyright law is that it be an œuvre de l'esprit, a work of the mind (Art. L112-1). Hence there must be a human intellectual contribution to the work. A list of types of work which are protected is given in Art. L112-2: this list (taken from the Berne Convention) is not limitative. The copyright protection of computer programs was, and to some extent still is, the subject of much debate in France. Patent protection was first excluded by Loi n°68-1 du 2 janvier 1968 sur les brevets d'invention\\"Loi n°68-1 du 2 janvier 1968 sur les brevets d'invention\\" Legifrance and defined in copyright by Loi n°85-660 du 3 juillet 1985 relative aux droits d'auteur et aux droits des artistes- interprètes, des producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des entreprises de communication audiovisuelle.\\"Loi n° 85-660 du 3 juillet 1985 relative aux droits d'auteur et aux droits des artistes-interprètes, des producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des entreprises de communication audiovisuelle\\" Legifrance The legal position was resolved by the transposition of May 14, 1991 EU Directive into French law: computer programs and any associated preparatory works qualify for copyright protection in France as in other European Union jurisdictions. Databases are protected by a related sui generis right. The term \\"author\\" is used to designate the original creator(s) of any type of protected work, e.g., the artist, photographer, director, architect, etc. Where the author cannot be identified, e.g., for anonymous works and collective works, the copyright is exercised by the original publisher. A collective work is a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created. A collective work is the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed. The author's rights, vest in such person.\\" The term of the exclusive right is 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published.\\"  Proprietary rights  The proprietary rights of the author allow him or her to exploit the work for financial gain. The author has the right to authorize the reproduction of the work (droit de reproduction) and to allow its public performance (droit de représentation); he or she may also prevent the reproduction or public performance. The author may transfer his or her proprietary rights to a third party. = Duration of proprietary rights = The general rule is that the proprietary rights of the author last for seventy (70) years after his or her death (Art. L123-1), or for one hundred (100) years after the author's death if the author is declared to have died on active service (mort pour la France) (Art. L123-10). The author is deemed to have died on 31 December of the year of death. Before February 2007, the periods of World War I and World War II were not taken into account for the determination of the expiry date of proprietary rights, with peculiar ways of counting these (Arts. L123-8 & L123-9 -> see the French Wikipedia article ). These exceptions applied to works published before and during the wars, and must be added whatever the date of the author's death. These extensions were removed (for non-musical works) by the Court of Cassation in February 2007. They still have to be added to the 70 years delay for musical works, because of a 1985 law. Loi n° 85-660 du 3 juillet 1985, art. 8. For collaborative works, the date of death of the last collaborator serves as the reference point for the 70 year post mortem auctoris period (Art. L123-2). Audiovisual works are treated similarly, although the list of collaborators is defined by the law: scriptwriter, lyricist, composer, director. Proprietary rights in pseudonymous, anonymous or collective works last for seventy (70) years after the date of publication (Art. L123-3). For phonographic works, the proprietary rights last for 50 years after the date of recording. Posthumous works are copyrighted 25 years from the year of publication. = Copyright management societies = As in other countries, there are a number of societies which collectively manage the licensing of different types of work and the collection of royalties on behalf of copyright holders. These societies typically operate as associations, and are regulated by the Code de la propriété intellectuelle (Arts. L321-1 to L321-13) and the Ministry of Culture. The most important are: *Centre Français d'Exploitation du droit de copie (CFC) *Sacem *ADAGP *SACD  Moral rights  French copyright law treats a protected work as an extension of the personality of the author which is protected by a certain number of moral rights. In general, the author has the right to \\"the respect of his name, of his status as author, and of his work\\" (Art. L121-1). The following rights are usually recognised: * right of publication (droit de divulgation): the author is the sole judge as to when the work may be first made available to the public (Art. L121-2). * right of attribution (droit de paternité): the author has the right to insist that his name and his authorship are clearly stated. * right to the respect of the work's integrity (droit au respect de l'intégrité de l'oeuvre): the author can prevent any modification to the work. * right of withdrawal (droit de retrait et de repentir): the author can prevent further reproduction, distribution or representation in return for compensation paid to the distributor of the work for the damage done to him (Art. L121-4). * right to protection of honour and reputation (droit à s'opposer à toute atteinte préjudiciable à l'honneur et à la réputation). The moral rights of the author may conflict with the property rights of the owner of the work, for example an architect who tries to prevent modifications to a building he designed. Such conflicts are resolved on a case by case basis, and recent jurisprudence has led to a weakening of certain moral rights, notably the right to the respect of the work. The moral rights are inalienable, perpetual and inviolable. They pass to the author's heirs or executor on the author's death, but may not be otherwise transferred or sold by the author or legal successors. Any agreement to waive an author's moral rights is invalid, although the author cannot be forced to protect moral rights to the work, and always has the option to refrain from exercising them. = The public domain under French copyright law = A work enters the public domain (domaine public) once the proprietary rights over it have expired. It may then be used without charge, so long as the moral rights of the author are respected.See Droit Moral as defined by the Cour de Cassation of Victor Hugo Notably, the name of the author and the original title of the work must be cited.  Exceptions  Art. L122-5 defines the exceptions to French copyright law, which are relatively restricted. Once a work has been published, the author cannot prevent: :1. Private family performances. :2. Copies for the private and personal use of the copier. This provision does not apply to works of art, computer programs (where a single safeguard copy is allowed, Art. L122-6-1-II) and databases. :3. In cases where the name of the author and the source are clearly indicated, ::a) Analyses and short citations justified by the critical, polemical, scientific or pedagogical nature of the work. ::b) Press reviews. ::c) Diffusion of public speeches as current news. ::d) Reproductions of works of art in catalogues for auctions in France (subject to regulatory restrictions). :4. Parody, pastiche and caricature, \\"taking into account the usage of the genre\\". :5. Acts necessary to access a database within the limits of the agreed use. There is no specific provision for government works or laws: the copyright is normally held by the relevant public body.  Criminal sanctions  Contrary to the position in most Common Law jurisdictions, the breach of proprietary rights is a criminal offense in France: contrefaçon (Arts. L335-2 to L335-4). This attracts a fine of up to 300,000 Euros (approx. US$391,850, or £250,300 as of January 2012) and a term of up to three (3) years imprisonment. These penalties are increased to a fine of up to €500,000 and a term of up to five (5) years imprisonment if the offense is committed in an organised group (bande organisée). There is no distinction between the breach of French copyright and the breach of foreign copyright, though the breach must occur in the French territory to be punishable. The import of infringing copies into France, and the distribution of such copies, are punished under the same provisions and are subject to the same penalties.  Relation to international copyright law  Under Art. 55 of the Constitution of 1958, a ratified treaty is superior to French domestic law. Hence the conflict of laws provisions of the Berne Convention will be used in determining the applicability of the French Code de la propriété intellectuelle.  Difference between copyright and droit d'auteur  The droit d'auteur or authors' rights, in France, Belgium, Romania or Germany, grant (subject to some exceptions) the benefice of the right to natural persons (the author and heirs) and denies it to legal persons (except for collective works, and for software), whereas \\"droits voisins\\" or neighbouring rights, grant rights to the editor or the producer. Both authors' rights and neighbouring rights are copyrights in the sense of English or U.S. law.Related rights Copyright requires a material fixation of the work, as for example a speech or a choreography work, although it is an intellectual work (an œuvre de l'esprit), they will not be protected if they are not embodied in a material support. Such requirement does not exist under the droit d'auteur. Thus an improvised live performance would still benefit from the protection of \\"droit d'auteur\\". = Moral rights = The classical difference between the two systems is the recognition of moral rights in the droit d'auteur whereas such rights did not initially exist in copyright. Hence, in civil law, the author is granted a moral right which sees the expression of the personality of the author in the work. In practice, the author will have a right to disclosure, a paternity right, a guarantee that the integrity of his work and his wishes are respected as well as a right of withdrawal (i.e., an author has the right to request his work to be withdrawn from circulation in exchange for compensation from those persons involved in its distribution who would moreover enjoy the right of priority in the event of the said work being redistributed). This right is attached to the author; it is inalienable and transmissible at the death of the author. Historically, such rights do not exist in copyright, as it has been for decades an economic model, granting solely proprietary rights to authors. However several countries have harmonized their legislation since the ratification of the Berne Convention. However, the United States of America still refuse to apply the moral rights recognized by this convention.Kwall, Roberta Rosenthal. \\"The Soul of Creativity: Forging a Moral Rights Law for the United States\\". Stanford University Press, 2010, p. 30. Nonetheless, In the United States of America, moral rights are explicitly recognized for works of visual art. Indeed, the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (VARA) recognizes moral rights but applies it only to works of visual art.Gassaway, Laura. Copyright and moral rights. (Copyright Corner). \\"Information Outlook,\\" Vol. 6, No. 12 (December 2002), p. 40. = Difference between copyright and droit d'auteur for audiovisual and cinematographic works = As regards the management of patrimonial rights, the difference between copyright and droit d'auteur is not so clear as in both system the producer controls the exploiting of the work. It can be stated that the droit d'auteur favours the author while copyright favours the right to copy (exploitation right) linked to the work itself.  Authorship  Under French law, the audiovisual work is considered as a collaborative work, that is, a work that has been created by multiple authors. The authorship is granted to natural persons (co-author) that have created the relevant work: scriptwriter, author of the musical composition etc. (L.113.7). In United States of America, audiovisual works are considered as \\"works made for hire\\" (works produced in relation with a contract for hire or service). The author of a work (either a natural or legal person) is the producer.  Term of protection of a work  In France, a work is protected until 70 years after the death of the last surviving co-author.  Applicable law for scriptwriters and directors  French law recognizes two types of droit d'auteur: moral rights and proprietary rights. French law rules the relation between authors and producers; such relations shall be formalized in a contract according to which the author assigns his proprietary rights to the producer. In the United States of America, labor law rules relations between \\"creators\\" and the production companies. Scriptwriters and directors are consequently the employees of the producer. As such, they can be fired and replaced at any moment, and their names will appear in the theme song only if their work fulfills the necessary conditions for the attributions of \\"credits\\" as provisioned under the MBA (Minimum Basic Agreement). American Law does not always grant moral rights to creators. Some rights related to moral and proprietary rights are negotiated. = Towards harmonization = The French and common-law systems have converged somewhat over time. Analogues to moral rights are increasingly recognized in U.S. courts, and eleven U.S. states recognize explicitly moral rights in law. The states of California and New York guarantee the integrity of the author's work, and the Visual Artists Rights Act, enacted October 27, 1990, incorporates moral rights of artists in a federal law. In the United Kingdom, moral rights have been incorporated in copyright law (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988). For a historical and comparative overview of moral rights law in the United States of America, see Thomas F. Cotter (1997) \\"Pragmatism, Economics, and the Droit Moral\\", 76 North Carolina Law Review 1 . The current tendency is that the droit d'auteur tends to guarantee an economic protection while copyright guarantee increasingly moral rights.

Höchst am Main became part of Frankfurt am Main in 1928 together with its boroughs Sindlingen, Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim. It is situated 10 km west of downtown Frankfurt on the north bank of the Main river at the Nidda River estuary. The well-preserved old city has been under the Denkmalschutz protection law since 1972. An important cultural event is the folklore festival, the Höchster Schloßfest, that brings many visitors to Höchst. It begins in the middle of June and last four weeks. It includes a festival in the old city, fireworks, and a jazz festival in the castle. In Höchst there is the Friedrich-Dessauer-Gymnasium, a sixth form Gymnasium.  History  = Middle Ages = Höchst is first mentioned in 790 as Hostat (meaning high site or high place). The name has nothing to do with the Hostato Saga regarding the Knight Hostato, who after being the only one to survive a battle was given the site by Charlemagne in thanks for his bravery. On 11 February 1355 Höchst received its town privileges by emperor Charles IV. In a charter dated 12 January 1356, Charles IV gave additional privileges to Höchst including the right to hold markets every Tuesday. In the middle-age city part, most of the timber framed houses stem from the period after the major fire in 1586. On 22 June 1622, during the Thirty Years' War, the Battle of Höchst saw a Catholic League and Spanish Empire armies defeat a Protestant force. A second Battle of Höchst occurred on 11 October 1795 when Habsburg soldiers clashed with Republican French troops. Höchst am Main became part of Frankfurt am Main in 1928. Until 1987 Höchst was the administrative seat of an independent Landkreis. Höchst is now the center of the Stadtbezirke (administrative district) Frankfurt-West with 120,000 residents. Economy In contrast to most other Stadtteile, Höchst is an old historical city (with town privileges since 1355) and is still the most important subcenter in the western part of Frankfurt. The name Höchst became well known throughout the world for the chemical and pharmaceutical corporation Hoechst AG which was established in 1863; except for a short interruption between 1925 and 1952, Hoechst AG has been headquartered in Höchst. In 1999 the company was merged with the French Rhône-Poulenc S.A. and became Aventis which, after another merger, became Sanofi-Aventis. Major research and production activities of the company continue to be conducted in Höchst. The site of the Hoechst works is now operated as the Höchst Industrial Park (Industriepark Höchst). It includes a notable expressionist building designed by Peter Behrens, the Technical Administration Building (Technische Verwaltungsgebäude).

Introduced in the series' first part, he was a student of Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and one of the three \\"Legendary Sannin\\"—along with Orochimaru and Lady Tsunade, his former teammates. Jiraiya appears as a perverted old man who occasionally returns to the village Konohagakure, reporting the activities of Orochimaru and the organization Akatsuki. Referred to as the \\"Toad Sage\\" and \\"Pervy Sage\\", he mentors Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze and later becomes the godfather and mentor of Minato's son, Naruto Uzumaki. Jiraiya appears in two Naruto films, and he is a playable character in most of the franchise's video games. Various pieces of merchandise based on him have been released. The character has received positive critical reception and is considered one of the strongest in the series. Reviewers have praised Jiraiya's introduction in the story and his relation with Naruto as his mentor. Out of all student-teacher relationships in Naruto, Jiraiya and Naruto's is the one Kishimoto likes the most. Creation and conception Manga author Masashi Kishimoto first conceived Jiraiya's name based on Kabuki. He conceptualized him as a wizard with frog-like traits. He gave him an incisive and energetic speech pattern specific to old Kabuki plays. Kishimoto stated that Jiraiya \\"makes everything more colorful\\" since he is one of the few characters who enjoy talking. Regarding the bonds in the story, Kishimoto highlighted the importance of the character's death during his fight against Pain; this remark was made since, in his last moments, Jiraiya manages to discover the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send a message to Naruto Uzumaki in which he explains how Pain can be defeated. Kishimoto felt he had done a good job of establishing Jiraiya's last moments. He commented that out of all the master-pupil relationships he had created in the Naruto series, the bond between Naruto and Jiraiya is his favorite, stating that drawing their interactions was \\"worthwhile\\".Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto, p. 143 Jiraiya was one of the characters that resonated the most with the author alongside Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, and Haku. At the 2015 New York Comic-Con, when asked which character besides Naruto is his favorite, Kishimoto chose Jiraiya. Due to the fans' preference, Kishimoto drew a sketch of Jiraiya in front of the audience at the event. He stated he felt nostalgic since this was the first time he had drawn Jiraiya or any other character in the series for a while. However, Kishimoto did not remember how to draw Jiraiya initially, and thus he used a person among the spectators who was cosplaying Jiraiya as a reference. After being asked which character's point of view he would choose to tell the story from instead of Naruto's if given the possibility, Kishimoto listed Jiraiya as one of his choices. He elaborated on this by stating Jiraiya did not have much knowledge when he was young, feeling that this aspect would have created an interesting contrast with Jiraiya's \\"not so much arrogant, but overconfident, blusterous, and very, very skilled\\" adult self and that the story presenting Jiraiya's development would have been \\"fun to draw\\". Kishimoto further mentioned that jutsu was still in the process of developing during Jiraiya's childhood, and he felt this would have been an engaging subject to depict in the series. Jiraiya is played by Hōchū Ōtsuka in the series' original animated adaptation, while David Lodge voices him in the English dub. David Lodge stated that Jiraiya is one of viewers' \\"favorite characters\\". When questioned if he is frequently asked to voice Jiraiya in new features since the character is a part of such a popular franchise, he answered affirmatively. Lodge stated that besides being known as the \\"Toad Sage\\" due to controlling frogs, Jiraiya is also known as the \\"Pervy Sage\\", considering this a \\"big deal\\" in Japan due to such content being classified as sensitive. He stated that in the United States, a lot of the things regarding the \\"Pervy Sage\\" part had to be restricted. Lodge said that Jiraiya was the best character he had ever played due to having \\"so many dimensions\\"; he elaborated on this by mentioning that while Jiraiya can be \\"crazy\\", he can also be a \\"very serious, philosophical, wise sage\\". He characterized this aspect of Jiraya's personality as \\"fun\\". He said he had \\"such a good time\\" playing Jiraiya, stating he managed to \\"delve into a character that is more than one-dimensional\\" in the process of voicing him. Lodge also stated he has \\"a huge fanbase\\" for Jiraiya's character. He commented that Jiraiya is his favorite character, characterizing him as \\"such a grand scope character\\". Appearances =In Naruto= Jiraiya is a ninja from the village of Konohagakure trained by Hiruzen Sarutobi, the future Third Hokage. He becomes known as the \\"Toad Sage\\" due to his training under the Great Toad Sage in the field of , enabling him to summon toads as allies during battles. The Great Toad Sage also informs Jiraiya of a prophecy that he will mentor a child who will either save the world or destroy it. As he grows older, Jiraiya and his two teammates, Orochimaru and Tsunade, are collectively referred to as the \\"Legendary Sannin\\" owing to their exemplary ninja abilities allowing them to survive a fight against Hanzo—Amegakure's dictator—during the Second Great Ninja War. Soon after, Jiraiya encounters a trio of Amegakure orphans consisting of Nagato, Yahiko, and Konan, training the three in ninjutsu to protect themselves before returning to the Land of Fire. At that time, Jiraiya considered Nagato to be the child from the Great Toad Sage's prophecy. For most of his adult life, though loyal to Konohagakure, Jiraiya periodically leaves his hometown to explore the world. Sometime later, Jiraiya becomes a mentor to Minato Namikaze, the future Fourth Hokage, who dies due to sealing the Nine-Tailed Fox inside his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki. Jiraiya makes only sporadic appearances, returning to Konohagakure after long absences to report on information he has learned throughout his travels. During his first appearance in the series' Part I, Jiraiya takes the time to train Naruto, teaching him his own signature abilities and trying to help him learn how to control Kurama. When his teacher, Hiruzen, who has resumed his duty as the Third Hokage since Minato's death, dies during an invasion by Orochimaru, Jiraiya is offered the position of Hokage. Despite this, Jiraiya thinks his inability to prevent Orochimaru from becoming a criminal makes him unworthy of the responsibility and instead offers to search for Tsunade so that she can take the position instead—a task he eventually succeeds at. After Naruto's flawed attempt to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha, Jiraiya decides to take the boy for two and a half years of training to make him strong enough to bring Sasuke back and to protect himself from the Akatsuki organization. In Part II, Jiraiya returns to inform Kakashi Hatake and Yamato about the threat Naruto can become under the Nine-Tails's influence by telling them of his near-death experiences when the youth used only a fraction of Kurama's power. To keep Naruto from participating in Team 7's new Sasuke-related mission, Jiraiya offers to train him again and takes Naruto to Yugakure, the Village Hidden in Boiling Water. After entrusting Naruto with the key to Kurama's seal, Jiraiya begins investigating the Akatsuki's leader, Pain. His investigation leads him to battle Pain, whom he recognizes to be Nagato using the corpses of Yahiko and five other ninja he met in his journey. At the battle's conclusion, while reflecting on his life, Jiraiya realizes that Naruto is the boy foretold in the prophecy. Due to this, remembering it was his first novel that inspired Minato to name his son after the book's protagonist, Jiraiya musters the strength to send a message able Nagato's Paths of Pain, along with a disabled Animal Path, to Naruto and the rest of Konohagakure to give them an edge. He then dies without regret as he sinks into the sea, knowing that Naruto is the foretold hero of the world. =In other media= Jiraiya makes an appearance in two Naruto films, Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds (2008) and Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire (2009). He is a playable character in most Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series, the Ultimate Ninja series, and the Path of the Ninja series. In the first Ultimate Ninja game (2003), he only appears as a support to Naruto during his special techniques. In the Path of the Ninja RPG series, he is a character who can be spoken to for information and support. In Ultimate Ninja 2 (2004), he is an available character and has been given variations of the Rasengan, fire techniques, and toads summoning techniques. In Path of the Ninja 2 (2006), he is not only a character in the storyline, but a \\"secret\\" acquirable character that can be added to the team as a fully active member. Reception Jiraiya has appeared in several of the main Shōnen Jump popularity polls. In the second and third, he ranked in the top ten. In the fourth poll, he ranked 11th. In the last poll conducted in 2011, Jiraiya was placed 16th. Merchandise based on Jiraiya has also been released, including action figures, key chains, and headbands similar to his. Naruto's Japanese voice actress, Junko Takeuchi, was reminded of Jiraiya's close relationship with Naruto when reading the script of The Last: Naruto the Movie. Several manga, anime, and video game reviewers have praised the character of Jiraiya. Davey Jones of ActiveAnime regarded Jiraiya’s training with Naruto as good comic relief and stated that the two characters are similar. AnimeonDVDs Justin Rich praised Jiraiya’s introduction in the series, describing him as a funny character. Jason Van Horn of IGN commented on Jiraiya's relationship with Naruto, writing that \\"they share so much in common\\". Matt Shingleton of DVDTimes viewed Jiraiya as \\"the greatest character Masashi Kishimoto [had] ever created in this series\\" and further said that \\"besides the fact he fills the comical pervert archetype [he is] one of the strongest characters in the series and just about everything about him is rough and unpredictable\\". Jason Thompson praised the character's Sage Mode, commenting that it would make a good cosplay. He also expressed shock at the character's death while fighting Pain, considering him a sympathetic person. Luke Carroll of Anime News Network enjoyed David Lodge's role as Jiraiya's English voice actor. Hiroshi Matsuyama found that Jiraiya's death had a major impact in his work as a game designer in the Naruto games due to his previous works from .hack never actually had a death in the narrative with the exception being Harold who is already dead during the .hack series. In 2010, Shueisha published the first novel Jiraiya wrote, which was inspired by his student Nagato and prompted Minato and Kushina Uzumaki to name their son after its protagonist. The novel is titled and follows the fictional character Naruto Musasabi. Naruto tries to track down his former comrade, Renge Momoashi, and unravel a mysterious conspiracy involving the destruction of a nearby village. In 2015, Shueisha released Jiraiya's second novel, , which presents a battle between two fighters who appear to be related.

He was the mayor of San Pedro Garza García, former senator and current member of the board of Grupo Alfa, a Monterrey-based chemical, food and auto-parts producer. He is well known for his art contribution to Nuevo León. Fernández Garza graduated with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University (U.S.), specialized in economics at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León and received a master's degree in business administration from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies. He is the founder and president of Comercializadora de Puros, Uniser (Havana, Cuba), Artesanarte and the Museo del Ojo in García, Nuevo León. In June 2005 he sold one of his companies, Especialidades Cerveceras, S.A. (the makers of premium beer Casta) to Fomento Económico Mexicano (FEMSA), world's second-largest Coca-Cola bottler. Fernández ran for governor of Nuevo León in 2003. He defeated former treasurer Fernando Elizondo in the National Action Party state primaries (56.5% vs. 20.8%) but lost the gubernatorial election against the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Natividad González Parás. He ran for mayor of San Pedro Garza Garcia in 2009 and won the election. His administration began on October 31 of 2009. His successor to the mayorship of San Pedro Garza García will be independent candidate Miguel Treviño . Public Safety During his campaign, Mauricio focused on promoting his anti-crime policies, as the growing crime wave was of concern for many citizens of San Pedro, the wealthiest municipality/city in Mexico. During his campaign, he stated that the city was controlled by the Beltran Leyva drug cartel - these statements caused much controversy. He also mentioned that the relative peace seen in the city was due to Beltran family members living in the city, and their pacts with other cartels to keep San Pedro a \\"safe zone\\". During his commencement speech, he mentioned that the man who issued him a death threat had been killed in Mexico City. This was done before the body was found by the authorities. One of his main strategies against the rising crime rate was the implementation of an \\"intelligence\\" body, which operated in secrecy and was financed by the city's wealthy businessmen. The mayor himself called the group \\"El Grupo Rudo,\\" which translated from Spanish to \\"The Rough Group.\\" This group created much controversy, as many thought this group operated illegally. The leader of this group was accused of torture by one of Mauricio's bodyguards, and was later killed by a member of an organized group. The son of the ex-governor Alfonso Martinez Dominguez, Fransico Martinez Cardenas, was in charge of collecting the money from the businessmen. The group was soon disintegrated, however many claim it still operates covertly. In an effort to reduce the increase in kidnappings and delinquency, he formalized a database that kept track of all domestic servant employees. The goal was to keep track of all of these employees, which number the thousands and work in the wealthy family's homes. One of the arguments in favor of such a database was that many of the kidnappings and robberies occurred because of tips given by the employees. Many human right groups rose in protest.

After retirement, he adopted the gō, or pen name, Yōzan (鷹山). Today, he is best remembered for his financial reforms, and he is often cited as an example of a good governor of a domain Biography Harunori was the younger son of Akizuki Tanemitsu, daimyō of Takanabe Domain in Hyūga Province. His mother was a granddaughter of the fourth daimyō of Yonezawa Domain, Uesugi Tsunanori.His childhood names were \\"Matsusaburō\\" (松三郎) and \\"Naomatsu\\" (直松). His mother died when he was very young, and is was large raised by his grandmother, which strengthened his ties to Yonezawa. At age ten he was adopted by Uesugi Shigesada, then daimyō of Yonezawa, who had a daughter but no male heir. After arriving in Yonezawa, from 1763 he became an ardent disciple of the Neo-Confucian scholar Hosoi Heishu, whose teaching would strongly influence his political philosophy and governing outlook. In 1766, he underwent the genpuku ceremony and received the kanji of \\"Haru\\" in his name from Shogun Tokugawa Ieharu as a sign of special favor. In 1767, he became daimyō of Yonezawa. The domain which he inherited had been deeply in debt for roughly a hundred years when Harunori took over; Shigesada even considered returning the domain to the shogunate as a last resort. However, he was convinced by his father-in-law, the daimyō of Owari Province, to instead resign as daimyō. the amount of the debt exceeded 200,000 ryō, which seemed unsurmountable given that the domain had a nominal kokudaka of only 150,000 koku. Furthermore, the domain had a very high proportion of retainers on its payroll compared with other domains for historic reasons, as the early rulers of Yonezawa had been reluctant to reduce the number of retainers from the time before the domain had been reduced who had served loyally from when the time the domain had exceeded 1,000,000 koku prior to the Battle of Sekigahara. To even add further to the domain's financial woes, during the tenure of Uesugi Shigemori, the domain had been forced by the shogunate to pay for the rebuilding of the temple of Kan'ei-ji in Edo, and had also suffered from severe flooding in 1755. Shigemori refused to cut back on his extravagances due to pride. Harunori began by imposing stringent fiscal restraints on spending, setting an example by wearing cotton clothes instead of silk and having his meals consist of one bowl of soup and one vegetable. He reduced his living allowance from 1500 ryō per year to 209 ryō and the number of maidservants from 50 to nine. He chose to keep all their retainers but cut all salaries to one-sixth of their former level. Faced with opposition by several of his karō, he ordered their execution. As soon as these efforts started to show results, the domain was then hit with a demand from the Shogunate to rebuild the western bailey of Edo Castle. However, the domain did not suffer much from the famine which swept Japan in the Tenmei era (1781–1789). Harunori also set policies encouraging new industry such as weaving, pottery and papermaking and encouraged existing enterprises such as paraffin, raw silk and linen. He required every family to plant a certain number of lacquer trees to help establish that industry, and turned many of the domain's samurai into farmers. Education was necessary to create the brilliant men required to enrich the country, and he reopened the han school which had closed down due to financial constraints and invited scholars from Edo to teach. He also established a medical school to teach the latest medical knowledge from Holland. Another policy change ensured adequate water from the mountains for the rice fields by enlisting retainers and samurai to dig irrigation ditches and to repair dikes. Administrative reform and personnel promotion based on merit, not class, eliminated waste and simplified public offices. As a result of these various measures, Yonezawa became fairly prosperous, and by 1823 the entire amount of the debt had been repaid. In 1830, less than a decade after Harunori's death, Yonezawa was officially declared by the shogunate to be a paragon of a well-governed domain. He revealed his views on governance and the role of a feudal lord in a letter to his son Haruhiro: Additionally, his views on self-discipline are well known in Japanese culture: See also * Uesugi clan Notes References * Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric and Käthe Roth.

He was the son of John Balch Greeley and Frances Dunn Cobb Greeley. He was a third cousin of American author and statesman Horace Greeley. Early military career He began his long and distinguished military career shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War. On 26 July 1861, he enlisted in the 19th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment at the age of 17, after having been rejected twice before. Over the next two years he worked his way up the enlisted ranks to 1st sergeant. On 18 March 1863, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 81st United States Colored Infantry. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 26 April 1864 and to captain on 4 April 1865. After the war he received a brevet promotion to major to rank from 13 March 1865 for \\"faithful and meritorious service during the war\\". He was mustered out of the Volunteer Army on 22 March 1867. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 36th Infantry Regiment of the Regular Army on 7 March 1867 and was reassigned to the 5th Cavalry Regiment on 14 July 1869 after the 36th Infantry was disbanded. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 27 May 1873.Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, 1789 to 1903. Francis B. Heitman. Vol. 1, pg. 473. Lady Franklin Bay Expedition Steamer Proteus in Arctic 1881 The Explorers of Lady Franklin Bay prior to departure in 1881. Photograph by Moses Rice. In 1881, First Lieutenant Greely was given command of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition on the ship Proteus. Promoted by Henry W. Howgate, its purpose was to establish one of a chain of meteorological- observation stations as part of the First International Polar Year. The expedition also was commissioned by the US government to collect astronomical and polar magnetic data, which was carried out by the astronomer Edward Israel, who was part of Greely's crew. Another goal of the expedition was to search for any clues of the , lost in the Arctic two years earlier.Berton, Pierre (1988). The Arctic Grail: The Quest for the North West Passage and the North Pole. Toronto: Random House of Canada Ltd., p. 437 Greely was without previous Arctic experience, but he and his party were able to discover many hitherto unknown miles along the coast of northwest Greenland. The expedition also crossed Ellesmere Island from east to west and Lt. James B. Lockwood and Sgt. David Legge Brainard achieved a new \\"farthest north\\" record of 83°23'8\\" on Lockwood Island.Geographical Items on North Greenland Encyclopedia Arctica 14: Greenland In 1882, Greely sighted a mountain range during a dog sledding exploration to the interior of northern Ellesmere Island and named them the Conger Range. He also sighted the Innuitian Mountains from Lake Hazen. Two consecutive supply parties failed to reach Greely's party encamped at Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island in 1882 and 1883. In accordance with his instructions for this case, Greely decided in August 1883 to abandon Fort Conger and retreat south with his team. They reached Cape Sabine expecting to find food and equipment depots from the supply ships, but these had not been provided. With winter setting in Greely and his men were forced to winter at Cape Sabine with inadequate rations and little fuel.Lotz, J. 2009.

A rescue expedition, led by Capt. Winfield Scott Schley on the USRC Bear (a former whaler built in Greenock, Scotland), was sent to rescue the Greely party. By the time Bear and ships Thetis and Alert arrived on June 22, 1884, to rescue the expedition, nineteen of Greely's 25-man crew had perished from starvation, drowning, hypothermia, and, in the case of Private Henry, gunshot wounds from an execution ordered by Greely.Schley, Winfield S Commander, US Navy [1887] 1884 Greely Relief Expedition Washington Printing Office (via American Libraries)'ENGLAND'S PRESENT TO AMERICA.; THE STEAM-SHIP ALERT FOR THE GREELY SEARCH EXPEDITION' 4/23/1884 New York Times.(via NYT Archives) Stereoscopic image of the Greely expedition exhibition at the Columbian Exposition, 1893 Greely and the other survivors were themselves near death; one of the survivors died on the homeward journey. The returning survivors were venerated as heroes, though the heroism was tainted by sensational accusations of cannibalism during the remaining days of low food. An exhibition on the \\"Greely expedition\\" was part of the Columbian Exposition in 1893 and was captured on stereoscopic images. Later career Greely receives the Medal of Honor from Secretary of War George Dern (1935) In June 1886, Greely was promoted to captain after serving twenty years as a lieutenant and, in March 1887, President Grover Cleveland appointed him as Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army with the rank of brigadier general. During his tenure as Chief Signal Officer of the Army, the following military telegraph lines were constructed, operated and maintained during the Spanish–American War: Puerto Rico, ; Cuba, ; the Philippines, . In connection with Alaska, then General Greely had constructed under very adverse conditions a telegraph system of nearly , consisting of submarine cables, land cables and wireless telegraphy, the latter covering a distance of , which at the time of installation was the longest commercial system regularly working in the world. In 1906, he served as military commander over the emergency situation created by the San Francisco earthquake. On February 10, 1906, he was promoted to major general and on March 27, 1908, after over 46 years of service, he retired from the Army, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64. In 1911 he represented the United States Army at the coronation of King George V. On March 21, 1935, a special act of Congress awarded Greely the Medal of Honor in recognition of his long and distinguished career. He is the second person (after SGM Frederick William Gerber) to be awarded the Medal of Honor for \\"lifetime achievement\\" rather than for acts of physical courage at the risk of one's own life. His was the second and last award of the Medal of Honor by the Army for non-combat service.Schwoch, James (In press, 2018). Wired into Nature: The Telegraph and the North American Frontier. Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press. (The other was to Charles A. Lindbergh for his solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.Schwoch, James (In press, 2018).

General Greely died on October 20, 1935, in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia.  Personal life  Henrietta Nesmith Greely attended the First Presbyterian Church of Newburyport. He married Henrietta Nesmith in 1878; they had six children, among whom was the landscape architect Rose Greely. Henrietta was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and one of the founding vice presidents general of the Children of the American Revolution. After the Civil War, Greely became a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States – a military society composed of Union officers and their descendants. He was also a member of the Sons of the Revolution, the General Society of the War of 1812 and the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1890, he became a founding member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) and was elected as the society's vice president. Upon the death of Admiral David D. Porter in February 1891, Greely became president of the District of Columbia Society of the SAR and served until the end of 1892.

He was member of the Cosmos Club. In 1905, he accepted the honor of serving as the first president of The Explorers Club and in 1915, he invited the Italian polar geographer Arnaldo Faustini to the United States for a lecture tour.

Until after WWII the Navy Medal of Honor could be awarded for noncombat actions, reflecting different criteria within the United States armed forces. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Medal in 1886, and the American Geographical Society's Charles P. Daly Medal in 1922. and Fort Greely were named in his honor.

(formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals) is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Canada. It develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products and branded generic drugs, primarily for skin diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, and neurology. Bausch Health owns Bausch & Lomb, a supplier of eye health products. The company was founded in California, in 1959, as ICN Pharmaceuticals. Under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson, Valeant adopted a strategy of buying up other pharmaceutical companies which manufactured effective medications for a variety of medical problems and then increasing the price of those medications. As a result, the company grew rapidly and in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Its largest acquisitions were Bausch & Lomb, in 2013, and Salix Pharmaceuticals, in 2015. Valeant also tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon. An attempted merge with Allergan, in 2014, failed and resulted in the company being sued for insider trading prior to their bid. In 2015, Valeant was involved in a number of controversies surrounding drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its drugs, which led to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, causing its stock price to plummet more than 90 percent from its peak, while its debt surpassed $30 billion. In 2016, Pearson was ousted and replaced by Joseph C. Papa, while investor Bill Ackman joined the board. In 2017, Ackman's Pershing Square fund, which held a major stake in the company, sold out for a reported loss of $2.8 billion. Following Ackman's exit, Paulson & Co. increased its stake in the company, became its largest shareholder, with its founder, John Paulson, joining the board, and vowing to rebuild the company's core franchises and to reduce its debt. Under Papa's leadership, by early 2018, the company had become profitable again; had settled the Allergan case for less than expected; and had lowered its debt by $6.5 billion. In July 2018, the name of the company was changed to Bausch Health Companies Inc., in order to distance itself from the public outrage associated with massive price increases introduced by Valeant. At the same time, a new ticker symbol, BHC replaced VRX. The company was featured in episode 3 of the first season of the Netflix documentary Dirty Money. “Drug Short” explains how Valeant lost 90 percent of its value between 2015 and 2016 taking down billionaires in the process and making an internet heroine of Fahmi Quadir, and a handful of other short sellers. They correctly bet that \\"the drug company’s price gouging, questionable tactics, and massive debt burden could not be sustained\\".Hacked Printers. Fake Emails. Questionable Friends. Fahmi Quadir Was Up 24% Last Year, But It Came at a Price. Institutional Investor, 9 January 2019 Current operations Bausch Health's main products include drugs in the fields of dermatology, neurology, and infectious disease. =Medications= The company's major prescription drugs are as follows: * Rifaximin (Xifaxan), for treatment of traveler's diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea * Budesonide (Uceris), to help get mild to moderate ulcerative colitis under control * Minocycline (Arestin, Solodyn), an antibiotic used for procedures related to periodontitis * Efinaconazole (Jublia), for treatment of toenail fungus * Acne drugs: clindamycin/tretinoin (Ziana), benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin (Acanya, Onexton), tretinoin (Atralin, Retin-A Micro), benzoyl peroxide (Microsphere) * Pimecrolimus (Elidel), used to treat atopic dermatitis * Metformin (Glumetza), to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus * Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL), for treatment of depression * Isoprenaline (Isuprel), for treatment of mild or transient episodes of heart block * Tetrabenazine (Xenazine), for treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease * Sodium nitroprusside (Nitropress), for the immediate reduction of blood pressure of patients in hypertensive crises * Penicillamine (Cuprimine), to treat Wilson's disease (a condition in which high levels of copper in the body cause damage to the liver, brain, and other organs), cystinuria (a condition which leads to cystine stones in the kidneys), and in people with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. * Bexarotene (Targretin), a retinoid for treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma * Aciclovir (Zovirax), a topical antiviral used against herpes viruses * Triethylenetetramine (Syprine), used for treatment of patients with Wilson's disease * Loteprednol (Lotemax) gel, a topical corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery =Over the counter products= The company's major over the counter drugs are as follows: * Ocuvite, an eye vitamin * PreserVision, an eye vitamin * ReNu Multiplus, for lubrication of contact lenses * Biotrue, an eye lubricant * Artelac, to treat dry eyes * Boston, for cleaning of contact lenses * SootheXP, an eye lubricant History =1959–2002: the Panić Years= Milan Panić In 1959, Yugoslavian immigrant Milan Panić, who had defected to the US three years earlier, founded ICN Pharmaceuticals (International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation) in his Pasadena garage. Panić ran the company for 47 years, during which ICN established a foothold in the industry by acquiring niche pharmaceuticals and through the development of Ribavirin, an antiviral drug that became the standard treatment for hepatitis C. In 1994, ICN merged with SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Viratek Inc., and ICN Biomedicals Inc. On June 12, 2002, following a series of controversies, Panić was forced to retire under pressure from shareholders. =2002–2010= In 2003, not long after Panić's ouster, ICN changed its name to Valeant. In 2006, the company received approval in the U.S. to market Cesamet (nabilone), a synthetic cannabinoid. The company also acquired the European rights to the drug for $14 million. In 2008, the Swedish pharmaceutical company Meda AB bought Western and Eastern Europe branches from Valeant for $392 million. In September 2008, Valeant acquired Coria Laboratories for $95 million. In November 2008, Valeant acquired DermaTech for $12.6 million. In January 2009, Valeant acquired Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences for $285 million. In July 2009, Valeant announced its acquisition of Tecnofarma, a Mexican generic drug company. In December 2009, Valeant announced its Canadian subsidiary would acquire Laboratoire Dr. Renaud, for C$23 million. In March 2010, Valeant announced its acquisition of a Brazilian generics and over-the-counter company for $28 million and manufacturing plant for a further $28 million. In April 2010, Valeant announced that its Canadian subsidiary would acquire Vital Science Corp. for C$10.5 million. In May 2010, Valeant acquired Aton Pharmaceuticals for $318 million. =2010–2016: the Pearson Years= Pearson in 2016 On September 28, 2010, Valeant merged with Biovail. The company retained the Valeant name and J. Michael Pearson as CEO, but was incorporated in Canada and temporarily kept Biovail's headquarters. Setting on a path of aggressive acquisitions, Pearson would ultimately turn Valeant into a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million. In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker Cephalon Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful. In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO Eugene Melnyk was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the Ontario Securities Commission. In the year before the merger with Valeant, Melnyk had settled with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 after having previously paid $1 million to settle other claims with the SEC. In July 2011, Valeant acquired Ortho Dermatologics from Janssen Pharmaceuticals for $345 million. The acquisition included the products Retin-A Micro, Ertaczo, and Renova, also known as tretinoin. In August 2011, Valeant acquired 87.2% of the outstanding shares of Sanitas Group for €314 million. In December 2011, Valeant acquired iNova Pharmaceuticals for A$625 million from Australian private equity firms Archer Capital with additional milestone payments of up to A$75 million. In December 2011, Valeant acquired Dermik, a dermatology unit of Sanofi. In January 2012, Valeant acquired Brazilian sports nutrition company Probiotica for R$150 million. In February 2012, Valeant acquired ophthalmic biotechnology company, Eyetech Inc. In April 2012, Valeant acquired Pedinol. In April 2012, Valeant acquired assets from Atlantis Pharma in Mexico for $71 million. In May 2012, Valeant acquired AcneFree for $64 million plus milestone payments. In June 2012, Valeant acquired OraPharma for approximately $312 million with up to $144 million being paid in milestone payments. In August 2012, Valeant agreed to buy skin-care company Medicis Pharmaceutical for $2.6 billion. In January 2013, Valeant acquired the Russian company Natur Produkt for $163 million. In March 2013, Valeant acquired Obagi Medical Products, Inc. In May 2013, the company acquired Bausch & Lomb from Warburg Pincus for $8.7 billion in a move to dominate the market for specialty contact lenses and related products. Bill Ackman In January 2014, Valeant acquired Solta Medical for approximately $250 million. In May 2014, Nestle acquired the commercial rights to some of Valeant's products for $1.4 billion. In July 2014, Valeant acquired PreCision Dermatology Inc for $475 million, a deal aimed at strengthening the firm’s skin products business. Along with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant made a bid to acquire Allergan; however, in November 2014, Allergan announced that it would be acquired by Actavis in a $66 billion transaction. Valeant and Pershing Square were subsequently accused of insider trading prior to their Allergan bid, and eventually settled the case in 2017. On April 1, 2015, Valeant completed the purchase of gastrointestinal treatment drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion after outbidding Endo Pharmaceuticals. On the final day of trading, Salix shares traded for $172.81, giving a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion. In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypt's largest drugmakers, for $800 million. In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi. In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million. In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division. In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum. In July 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson \\"excessive\\". Philidor controversy On October 21, 2015, Citron Research founder Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, published claims that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty companies were controlled by Valeant, and allegedly resulted in improper bookkeeping of revenues. In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees, and with all written communication under fictitious names. Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were \\"erroneous.\\" On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant. In 2018, Gary Tanner, who was a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, the former chief executive of Philidor Rx Services, were prosecuted over a kickback scheme. They were sentenced to a year in prison after being convicted on four charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. They were also ordered to forfeit $9.7 million in kickbacks. Tanner had been responsible for managing Valeant’s relationship with Philidor as well as Valeant’s “alternative fulfillment” program, which the company used to increase prescriptions for its own (expensive) drugs instead of generic substitutes.Ex-Valeant, Philidor executives get prison for fraud, CNBC, 30 October 2018 2015 drug price inflation controversy An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant under Michael Pearson had been the acquisition of medical and pharmaceutical companies and the subsequent price increases for their products. Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines was at the time described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as \\"deeply immoral\\" and \\"similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education.\\" This strategy had also attracted the attention of regulators in the United States, particularly after the publication in The New York Times of an article on price gouging of specialty drugs. In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies. The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine was 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe. In late September 2015, members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of \\"two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant had raised the price of Nitropress by 212% and Isuprel by 525%\\". The New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's \\"plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists, and jack up the price of their drugs\\". After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%. A The New York Times article on October 4, 2015 stated that: Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: \\"Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on.\\" In January 2016, she said she would be \\"going after\\" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. She was unsuccessful in having any impact on drug prices after a failed bid for Presidency in 2016. By October 2015, Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's \\"drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program.\\" The House Oversight Committee also requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices. Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation. On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved \\"buttons\\", the polymer discs used to make gas permeable contact lenses. Share price erosion and the ousting of Michael Pearson From 2015 to 2017, Valeant shares plummeted more than 90 percent. Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Co., and Viking Global Investors lost billions. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion. However, hedge fund herding continued to incite hedge fund portfolio managers to continue to buy Valeant shares. In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement was found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director. Valeant executives testify before the Senate Special Committee on Ageing in 2016 In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016, Valeant said that it was the \\"subject of investigations\\" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging, and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and had received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities.\\" On April 27, 2016, Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson, and Howard Schiller were forced to appear before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model. =2016–present: Valeant under Joseph Papa= On April 25, 2016, Valeant named Perrigo chief executive Joseph Papa as a permanent replacement for Pearson, and entrusted him with turning around the company. Papa set on a path of strategic sales, debt reduction, and organic growth. By January 2017, the company had sold its skincare brands to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion and its Dendreon biotech unit to Sanpower for $819.9 million. In June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million. In July, the company also divested Obagi Medical Products for $190 million. In November, it announced it would sell Sprout Pharmaceuticals back to its original owners, two years after acquiring the business for $1 billion. By January 2018, the company had divested itself of 13 non-core businesses, reducing its debt to $25 billion, and had settled or dismissed 70 pending lawsuits, including the Allergan insider trading case. On January 8, 2018, the company announced that its Bausch + Lomb unit had received a CE Mark from the European Commission for the distribution of its Stellaris product in Europe. On December 16, 2019, the company settled the class action lawsuit for approximately $1.2 billion over the stock plunge. They denied allegations of all wrongdoing as part of the settlement. =Acquisition history= References External Links * * Category:Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Canada Category:Canadian brands Category:Companies based in Laval, Quebec Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1959 Category:1959 establishments in California Category:S&P;/TSX 60 Index Category:Life sciences industry Category:Specialty drugs Category:Tax inversions ","title":"Bausch Health"},{"id":"2350174","text":"Nieder-Erlenbach is since August 1, 1972, the northernmost city district and an Ortsbezirk of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The Anna-Schmidt-Schule, a private school, is located in Nieder-Erlenbach.  Geographic location  Nieder-Erlenbach, founded as Haufendorf, lies in the southern foothills of the Wetterau on the same Erlenbach, right tributary of the Nidda. The Frankfurt Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main) is about 9 kilometers away, Bad Vilbel (town hall) about 2.5 kilometers. Petterweil is 3 miles north. To Dortelweil in the east, as well as to Nieder-Erlenbach in the west about 2 km. In the southwest lies Harheim and in the southeast Massenheim - each 2 km (1,24 miles) away.  History  In the year 779 Nieder-Erlenbach was first mentioned in the Lorsch Codex as Arilbach (Erlenbach): a woman Meginburc donated the Lorsch Abbey with all her property there. In addition to agricultural land, commercial buildings and residential buildings, these were also four serfs. Nieder-Erlenbach was after this entry in Gau Wettereiba (Wetterau). From 1376 the imperial city Frankfurt am Main exercised the rule in Nieder-Erlenbach; the city could also occupy the mayor and suffragan offices according to the right of village rule conferred by Karl IV. In 1401, the king once more expressly commanded the Nieder-Erlenbachern to obey Frankfurt. The reason of this arrangement is not known, but does not indicate great love of the villagers to their urban rulers. The officials appointed by Frankfurt called themselves in the episode (at the latest from 1403) Burggrafen. In the 17th century Nieder-Erlenbach was twice destroyed by devastating fires (1602 and 1677). After the founding of Free City Frankfurt, the Nieder-Erlenbacher were represented by a deputy in the Legislative Body from 1823, but only in 1853 did the villagers receive universal suffrage. In 1866 Prussia occupied the Free City of Frankfurt after the German War and in the Peace Treaty of September 3, 1866 gave Nieder- Erlenbach to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.Art. 15, Nr. 6 des Friedensvertrages, abgedruckt bei: Ernst Rudolf Huber: Dokumente zur deutschen Verfassungsgeschichte 2 = Deutsche Verfassungsdokumente 1851–1900. 3.

Biography Gómez Manrique was born in Amusco. The fifth son of Pedro Manrique de Lara y Mendoza, (1382–1440), adelantado mayor of Leon. Gómez Manrique was introduced into public life at an early age, took a prominent part against the constable Alvaro de Luna during the reign of John II, went into opposition against Miguel Lucas de Iranzo in the reign of Henry IV, and declared in favor of the then infanta Isabel, soon to be Queen Isabel I of Castile, whose marriage with Ferdinand of Aragon, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, he promoted. Besides being a distinguished soldier, Manrique acted as a moderating political influence and, when appointed corregidor of Toledo, was active in protecting the converted Jews from popular resentment. His will was signed on the 31st of May 1490, and he is known to have died before the 16th of February 1491. Manrique inherited the literary taste of his uncle Iñigo López de Mendoza y de la Vega, Marquis of Santillana, and was greatly esteemed in his own age; but his reputation was afterwards eclipsed by that of his nephew Jorge Manrique (died 1478), the son of his eldest brother Rodrigo Manrique de Lara, (died 1476), and whose Coplas por la muerte de su padre were continually reproduced. Manrique's poems were not printed until 1885, when, they were edited by Antonio Paz y Melia. They at once revealed him to be a poet of eminent merit, and it seems certain that his Consejos, addressed to Diego Arias de Avila, inspired the more famous Coplas of his nephew. His didactic verses are modelled upon those of his uncle the Marquis of Santillana, Don Iñigo. He wrote the Representación del nascimiento de Nuestro Senor, a play on the Passion, and two momos, or interludes, played at court, and a large number of poems.

Preston of the Yukon characters. Early life Born in Buffalo, New York, Striker attended Lafayette High School and the University of Buffalo, where he was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He dropped out of college, first serving a brief stint in New York City with an amateur theatrical company. Returning to Buffalo, he joined the staff of radio station WEBR (now WDCZ), working as an announcer. In 1929, he moved to WTAM in Cleveland, Ohio, where he served as announcer and continuity writer and wrote his first radio drama script, a biography of Stephen Foster. Lured back to WEBR as station manager, Striker wrote material ranging from skits to half- hour mysteries and Western scripts. Striker soon drifted to freelancing, creating and writing his own series and selling them to stations across the United States. He began a long association with station owner George W. Trendle and radio station WXYZ in Detroit, which was trying to make a name for itself as a producer of radio drama, creating and writing the early series Thrills of the Secret Service, Dr. Fang, and Warner Lester, Manhunter (which introduced Mike Axford, later a supporting character on The Green Hornet). The Lone Ranger Late in 1932, Striker began working on The Lone Ranger; his earliest scripts were largely reworked from his earlier series Covered Wagon Days. A letter from Trendle dated Monday, January 30, 1933, clearly gives Striker credit for creating the character. However, by 1934 Striker was pressured by Trendle to sign over his rights to the Lone Ranger, and Trendle claimed credit as the creator. This sparked a long-term controversy over the creation of The Lone Ranger, extending as far as a 1960 television appearance by Striker on To Tell the Truth, which mentioned his role in the character's creation. The actual first trial episodes of The Lone Ranger were broadcast on WEBR in Buffalo prior to the official premiere on WXYZ. These first broadcasts starred Buffalo actor John L. Barrett weeks before George Stenius (who later changed his name to George Seaton and became a film director) played the role. When the Lone Ranger series began to gain popularity, Trendle convinced Striker to move to WXYZ, where he eventually became head of WXYZ's script department. In Detroit, James Lipton portrayed the Lone Ranger's nephew, Dan Reid, during the early 1940s. Striker was extremely prolific. In addition to writing 156 Lone Ranger scripts a year, he wrote The Green Hornet (built around the Lone Ranger's descendant, Britt Reid) and a short-lived series, Ned Jordan Secret Agent. He scripted various Lone Ranger novels, two movie serials, and The Lone Ranger comic strip. He also contributed scripts to Challenge of the Yukon (later adapted for television as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon). Striker's work as a comic strip writer extended to writing The Green Hornet comic books and the 1945 newspaper strip The Sea Hound (based on The Adventures of the Sea Hound radio series that Striker contributed scripts to). He was also the author of the popular boy's adventure novels featuring \\"Tom Quest.\\" Striker's later work included stints on the television versions of The Lone Ranger and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, which were initially being produced while the radio series were still on the air. He provided the stories for many TV episodes by reworking old scripts from the radio series. Other writers adapted the stories for television and were credited as the \\"scriptwriter.\\" Striker's credit was given as \\"From the radio program edited by Fran Striker.\\" Striker was 59 when he died in a 1962 car accident in Elma, while moving with his wife and children. His final work was a historical novel, One More River, published posthumously. Fran was interred at Arcade Rural Cemetery in Arcade. His papers are in the archives of the University at Buffalo. The characters Lucas Striker and Amy Striker in the 1981 film The Legend of the Lone Ranger were named in honor of Fran Striker. He was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1998. Sources *Bisco, Jim. Buffalo's Lone Ranger: The Prolific Fran Striker Wrote the Book on Early Radio.

It is a free software game under the GPLv2 license created by Artsoft Entertainment and designed by Holger Schemel.  History  With its release in 1995,Changes readme for the early versions of Rocks'n'Diamonds. Retrieved on 07-may-2008. it is one of the earliest games available for Linux, It belongs e.g. to the standard install size of the games package for SUSE Linux. and it also runs on MS-DOS, Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X systems. The DOS version is based on code by Guido Schulz. The native Emerald Mine game engine is based on an older version of Emerald Mine for X11 by David Tritscher, which is used to read and play all native Emerald Mine levels. Since 2014 the source code is available via a Git repository.rocksndiamonds.git on git.artsoft.org The game was later ported to various platforms, for instance in 2014 to the OpenPandora handheld.rocksndiamonds on repo.openpandora.org  Gameplay  Rocks'n'Diamonds features gameplay elements from all the games mentioned above, usually in the form of sub-games, although levels can feature combinations of elements from any of the games mentioned above, as well as new ones. There are currently more than 50,000 levels available on Rocks'n'Diamonds-related pages. Rocks'n'Diamonds can also read native levels from the games Emerald Mine, Supaplex and Diamond Caves II. = Boulder Dash = The Boulder Dash game involves collecting a set number of diamonds after which an exit door opens through which the player can enter the next level. The levels are filled with dirt which can be dug simply by moving through it. This creates empty space. Diamonds can be collected by moving into them. Rocks and diamonds can rest on dirt, walls (only indestructible and slippery/magic walls), or other rocks and gems, but once these are removed (or the space next to them), they will fall down. This is sometimes useful, as the player can drop things on top of monsters (butterflies and fireflies) roaming the levels. Some destroyed monsters drop gems necessary to achieve the necessary number to complete the level. Amoeba can be dangerous and unpredictable, but also occasionally useful for several reasons of too few diamonds, or if you need to destroy a monster. = Supaplex and Emerald Mine = The Supaplex and Emerald Mine games can be considered clones of Boulder Dash themselves, although they have added elements, including explosives, acid, locked doors with matched keys, and more. Rocks'n'Diamonds provides a download of approximately 50000 Emerald Mine levels, however, it can only play a very limited amount of them under its primary engine; because of this, it also includes a [now] obsolete copy of Emerald Mine for X11 to play those levels. One significant feature missing from this implementation (but present in Emerald Mine for X11) is wrap-around movement. = Sokoban = The Sokoban game is a puzzle, and can be considered to be viewed from above, as its elements are not affected by gravity. This game lets the player push giant light bulbs into sockets in order to finish the level. = Level editor = The game includes a level editor that lets the player create his/her own levels. The game also supports custom graphics, as well as whole new level elements (custom elements, also called CEs, see below), which can be created without any programming knowledge.  Custom Elements  Custom Elements (also known as CEs) are elements created in the level editor. There are only a few things impossible to accomplish with them, although some things are more difficult to do than others nearly anything can be made. New custom element techniques are occasionally discovered by users.

He played professional baseball for 10 years from 1912 to 1921, including seven seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers from 1915 to 1920 and for the St. Louis Browns in 1921. Between 1915 and 1919, Boland appeared in 198 games for the Tigers, 110 as a starter and compiled a 67-47 win–loss record and a 3.01 earned run average. After suffering a broken arm, he appeared in only 11 games in 1920 and 1921 and compiled a 1-6 record with an 8.73 earned run average. Early years Boland was born in Rochester, New York, in 1892. His older brother Pat Boland played baseball for the Blue Labels team. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Boland began playing professional baseball in 1912 for the Akron Rubbermen of the Central League. He then spent the 1913 and 1914 seasons with the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association. In 1914, Boland appeared in 38 games for the Volunteers and compiled a 17-13 record with a 3.03 earned run average. =Detroit Tigers= On August 28, 1914, the Nashville club sold Boland to the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut on April 14, 1915, as a member of the 1915 Detroit Tigers that compiled a 100-54 for the second best winning percentage in franchise history. Boland's record in his rookie season was 13–7 with a 3.11 earned run average. On August 16, 1915, he came within four batters of throwing a no hitter, retiring the first 23 Cleveland Indians batters he faced, only to give up a lone single to Ben Paschal, a 19-year-old pinch-hitter who was making his major league debut. Paschal's hit off Boland was his only hit of the 1915 season. Boland and the Tigers went on to win the game 3–1. In 1916, Boland appeared in a career-high 46 games, only nine as a starter, and compiled a 10-3 record with a 3.94 earned run average. His .769 winning percentage was the best in the American League. The 1917 season may have been Boland's best. Boland appeared in 43 games, 28 as a starter, and compiled a 16-11 record with a 2.68 earned run average. On August 4, 1917, he again narrowly missed a no-hitter. Pitching against the Yankees, he did not allow a hit until the sixth inning and allowed only one hit in the game. In 1918, Boland appeared in 29 games, 25 as a starter, and compiled a 14-10 record with a 2.65 earned run average. In his fifth season with the Tigers, Boland started a career-high 30 games and had a career-high 18 complete games. However, he posted his first losing record at 14-16 despite a 3.04 earned run average. At the end of the 1918 season, Boland reported to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station for service in the Navy. However, World War I ended a few weeks later, and Boland was discharged from the Navy in January 1919. Using a sharp breaking curve, Boland once struck out Babe Ruth three times in a game. Ruth opined that Boland had \\"one of the greatest curveballs ever pitched.\\" H. G. Salsinger, the editor of The Detroit News for 49 years, placed Boland on his second all-time Tigers team and wrote that Boland in his prime \\"was reputed to have the best curveball in the league.\\" Boland later recalled that, while they always talked about his curveball, he struck out Ruth with \\"fast ones, all in on his hands.\\" He once defeated the Yankees 12 games in a row. On September 25, 1919, Boland was the Tigers' starting pitcher in a game against Cleveland that created a scandal in 1926 after Dutch Leonard testified that Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Leonard and another player had met under the grandstand and agreed to \\"fix\\" the game in favor of Detroit. It was also alleged that the players had further agreed to allow players to boost their batting averages. Detroit batters had 19 hits and scored nine runs, and Cleveland batters had 13 hits and five runs off Boland. Boland gave up two triples to Speaker, and Speaker later misplayed a fly ball, giving Boland his only triple of the 1919 season. Boland denied any involvement in fixing the game and claimed in December 1926 to be the most surprised man in the world at the revelation. However, he acknowledged that there were a lot of \\"friendship games\\" at the end of a season. Boland went on to say: \\"The way I figure it, about one in every 300 games is crooked.\\" Boland broke his arm in 1919 and was never the same. In 1920, Boland was 0–2 with a 7.79 earned run average in four games and innings pitched. =St. Louis Browns= In the spring of 1921, Boland's arm was still bothering him. The Tigers granted Boland an unconditional release on April 11. He was signed by the St. Louis Browns on May 7. Boland appeared in seven games for the Browns, six as a starter, and compiled a 1–4 record with a 9.33 earned run average. He appeared in his last major league game on June 17, 1921. On June 28, 1921, the Browns unconditionally released Boland. During his seven seasons in the major leagues, Boland appeared in 209 games, 119 as a starter, with a record of 68–53 and a 3.25 earned run average. Family and later years Boland was married on May 21, 1917, to Grace Bell Russelo. He defeated the New York Yankees the day before the wedding. After retiring from baseball, Boland worked as a cement contractor and later as a construction foreman for the Detroit Department of Public Works. He retired in 1957 and died at Detroit's Mount Carmel Hospital in 1973 following a three-week illness, aged 81. Boland was survived by two sons and two daughters.

Until sometime in the 1980s the company's products were marketed under the brand name \\"Hamilton Beach Scovill\\", reflecting a merger that occurred in the 1940s. In 1990, the company merged with Proctor Silex, another household appliance manufacturer. Key market competitors include Cuisinart, Black & Decker, Salton, De'Longhi, and Sunbeam. History Founded in April 1910 by inventor Frederick J. Osius in Racine, Wisconsin, the Hamilton Beach Manufacturing Company took its name from two men Osius hired, Louis Hamilton and Chester Beach. He hired Hamilton as the new company's advertising manager, and Beach to work as a mechanic. Osius did not care for his own name, so he paid Hamilton and Beach $1000 each for the right to use their names instead. The company mostly sold products that Osius had invented and patented, but Chester Beach had invented a high-speed fractional motor in 1905, which the company used in many of its products. Osius designed the agitator implement for the company's first milkshake machine, the Cyclone Drink Mixer, introduced in 1910. Frederick J. Osius, \\"Agitator implement\\", U.S. Patent 1,005,653, filed September 20, 1910, issued October 10, 1911.\\"Our History\\", Hamilton Beach Brands, Anne Cooper Funderburg, \\"Milkshake\\", in Darra Goldstein, ed., The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, 2015, , s.v. Hamilton and Beach left the company in 1913 to form their own firm, Wisconsin Electric Company. Osius sold Hamilton-Beach to Scovill Manufacturing in 1922 and moved to Millionaires' Row in Miami Beach. The Hamilton Beach drink mixer, with its characteristic spindle and metal container, was found at soda fountains of drug stores throughout North America. Other products included stand mixers (for making batter), fans, and hair dryers. The spindle drink mixer was expanded in the 1930s to enable multiple milk shakes to be processed at once. The original company continues as the Hamilton Beach side of Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. As of 2012, all of Hamilton Beach's appliances are manufactured by subcontractors in China.

By the end of 1813, Jackson was down to a single regiment whose enlistments were due to expire in mid-January. Although Governor Willie Blount had ordered a new levy of 2,500 troops, Jackson would not be up to full strength until the end of February. When a draft of 900 raw recruits arrived unexpectedly on January 14, Jackson was down to a cadre of 103 and Coffee, who had been \\"abandoned by his men.\\" Jackson's men consisted of 175 militia and 30 artillery before the battle and were aided by Lower Creek and Cherokee natives, who had around 200 warriors. The Creek numbered between 400 and 500 warriors. Battles Since new men had sixty-day enlistment contracts, Jackson decided to get the most out of his untried force. He departed Fort Strother on the seventeenth and marched toward the village of Emuckfaw to cooperate with the Georgia Militia. However, this was a risky decision. It was a long march through difficult terrain against a numerically superior force, and the men were inexperienced and insubordinate. A defeat of Jackson would have prolonged the war. On January 22, 1814, Jackson was encamped about from Emuckfaw. At dawn, a strong force of Red Sticks, camped away, attacked Jackson's position but were driven off after about thirty minutes. Jackson sent Coffee with a force of 400 to burn the Indian camp. Upon seeing the strength of their position, Coffee did not attack and returned to Jackson's position. The Red Sticks attacked again. Coffee was seriously wounded when he led a small party to turn their flank. The Creek were driven off with a loss of 54 killed. At this point, Jackson had no choice but to retreat to Fort Strother. Because of the difficulty of the earlier crossing of the Emuckfaw Creek, Jackson took a longer route back to Fort Strother. Even so, the crossing was difficult. On the morning of January 24, 1814, he began to re- cross the creek. When Jackson's artillery was about to enter the ford, alarm shots sounded in the woods. Having anticipated an attack, Jackson had ordered his advance guard to counterattack and attempt an envelopment. The rear guard panicked and retreated. For reasons unknown, the Red Sticks were unable to take advantage of the situation, and a handful of defenders drove them off. Jackson's losses for the two engagements were 24 killed and 71 wounded. The Creek's casualties were 54 killed and an unknown number of wounded. Aftermath Although Jackson had been forced to withdraw, the Red Sticks had lost their best opportunity for a decisive victory against the American forces. Jackson returned to Fort Strother and did not resume the offensive until mid-March.

His wife was a daughter of General Nozu Michitsura. He was the founder of the Imperial Japanese Army Engineering Corps. Biography Uehara Yūsaku =Early career= Uehara was born as Tatsuoka Shinaga in Miyakonojō, Hyūga Province (present-day Miyazaki Prefecture), as the second son a samurai in the service of Satsuma Domain. In 1875, he was adopted by the Uehara family, a cadet branch of the Shimazu clan, and changed his name to Uehara Yūsaku. He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1879 with Akiyama Yoshifuru as one of his classmates, and his speciality was military engineering. In June 1881, he was sent to France for studies on modern military techniques, including fortification and artillery. He was promoted to lieutenant in September 1882 and to captain in June 1885, while still in France. After his return to Japan in December 1885, he served in administrative positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. In 1889 he was sent as a military attaché to Europe. He was promoted to major in May 1890 and was assigned to the IJA 5th Division, commanded by his father-in- law, General Nozu Michitsura. Uehara came to the attention of Kawakami Soroku and was recruited to become one of his \\"brain trust\\". In August 1892, Uehara was appointed aide-de-camp to Prince Arisugawa Taruhito and also served as an instructor at the Army Staff College. From July to November 1893, he was send as a military attache to Annam and to Siam and from June 1894 was sent to Korea during the Donghak Rebellion. With the start of the First Sino-Japanese War, Uehara transferred directly to the Ōshima Yoshimasa, which defeated the Chinese at the Battle of Seonghwan outside of Asan, south of Seoul in the first land engagement of war. Uehara was on the staff of the IJA 1st Army (commanded by General Nozu Michitsura) and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in September 1894 while in Korea. He rose to the position of chief-of-staff of the IJA 1st Army in March 1895. In May, he was reassigned to the 2nd Bureau of the General Staff and in March 1896 was assigned to accompany Prince Fushimi Sadanaru as part of Japan's official delegation to the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. The delegation remained until August, during which time he was official reassigned to the 4th Burea of the General Staff. After his return to Japan, he was promoted to colonel in October 1897. In 1899 he was the Japanese delegate to the Hague Convention. =As general= Uehara was promoted to major general in July 1900, and commandant of the Army Artillery School. From August 1903 to February 1904, he was sent as a military attache to Europe. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Uehara became chief-of- staff of the Japanese Fourth Army (commanded by General Nozu Michitsura). By many accounts, General Nozu had a difficult personality, and his son-in-law was one of the few people who could get along with him.Dupuy, Encyclopedia of Military Biography However, Uehara had many disagreements with General Kageaki Kawamura and remained on bad terms with Kawamura throughout his career. He was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1906 and ennobled as a baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage in September of the following year.『官報』第7272号「授爵敍任及辞令」September 23, 1907 In December 1908 he became the commander of the IJA 7th Division. His appointment was controversial, as it was the first time an engineering officer had been appointed a divisional commander. The appointment had the support of General Terauchi Masatake, and Uehara specifically requested an assignment far from Tokyo, so that the Choshu-dominated Army Ministry would be unable to interfere. The IJA 7th Division was a garrison force in Asahikawa, Hokkaido. From September 1911 he commanded the IJA 11th Division. In December 1912, Uehara was appointed Army Minister in Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi's second cabinet. Since the civilian government was pursuing a tight fiscal policy, it soon came into conflict with the army, which was demanding an increase in funding for another two infantry divisions. When Uehara resigned as Army Minister over this conflict, the remainder cabinet resigned en masse when the Army refused to nominate a successor, precipitating the collapse of Saionji's government. This event was known as the \\"Taisho Political Crisis\\".Sims, Japanese Political History From March to May 1913, Uehara was commander of the IJA 3rd Division. In April 1914, he became Inspector General of Military Training, the third most prestigious post in the Army. In February 1915, Uehara was promoted to general and became a member of the Supreme War Council; he also became Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, remaining in this post longer than any person before or after (with the exception of a member of the Imperial House). While in this position, he authorized the Siberian Intervention in support of White Russian forces against the Bolshevik Red Army in the Russian Civil War. Uehara received the rank of marshal in April 1921, and his kazoku title was raised to shishaku (viscount).華族一覧表 勲功者の部 1 He retired shortly afterwards, and served as the president of the Kaikosha association for retired veterans. Uehara died in 1933 of peptic ulcer disease and cardiovascular disease at his home in Tokyo at the age of 77. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

History Robert Nobel already had experience of kerosene from the lamp and lamp oil warehouse Aurora in Finland. In Baku he would once again come into contact with oil. The photo shows samples of kerosene being taken in Baku. The Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company was an oil-producing company that had its origins in a distillery, founded by Robert and Ludvig Nobel in Baku in 1876, which, in 1879, turned into a shareholding company headquartered in St. Petersburg. The share capital of three million rubles was divided as follows: 53,7% Ludwig Nobel, 31,0% Baron Peter von Bilderling, 4,7% I.J. Zabelskiv, 3,8% Alfred Nobel, 3,3% Robert Nobel, 1,7% au Baron Alexandre von Bilderling. Pipeline transport was pioneered near Baku by Vladimir Shukhov and the Branobel company in 1878–1880. On 10 April 1902, the company signed a contract for the purchase of oil fields in Romany, which were owned by the oil producer Isabey Hajinsky. On 17 October 1905, in accordance with the Committee of Ministers, the company purchased the oil fields owned by oil producer A. Adamov. The company's fixed capital in 1914–1917 was 30 million rubles. By 1916, it was the largest oil company in Russia, producing 76 million poods of oil. Between 1877 and 1901, the company drilled over 500 wells, produced 150 million barrels of oil, and employed 12,000 workers. Challenges Share of the Russian General Oil Corporation, issued 28. April 1918 In 1912, the Russian General Oil Corporation was founded in London as an English holding company and united some 20 of the most important Russian and foreign banks. These included: *A.I. Mantashev & Co. *G.M. Lianozov Sons *Moscow-Caucasus Trade Company *Caspian Partnership *Russian Petroleum Society *Absheron Petroleum Society By 1914, the fixed capital in oil was more than 120 million rubles. The Russian General Oil Corporation, buying a considerable number of shares in the Berlin Exchange, attempted to take control of Branobel. The move failed and by 1916 Emanuel Nobel had bought not only a considerable share in the Russian General Oil Corporation, but had also established control over other oil businesses in the region, such as Volga-Baku Company, A.I. Mantashev & Co., the Anglo-Russian Maximov Oil Company in London and G.M. Lianozov Sons, of which he personally owned a third.Tolf, Robert (1976): The Russian Rockefellers, Stanford, p. 188-190. About 12% of the money left to establish the Nobel Prizes by Alfred Nobel came from his shares in the company; he was its largest individual investor. The Russian Revolution and Branobel On 28 April 1920, the Bolsheviks seized power in Baku and Branobel's oil business in Azerbaijan was nationalized. In May 1920, the Nobel family sold almost half the Branobel's shares in its possession to Standard Oil of New Jersey. At the time it was considered uncertain whether the Bolshevik regime would last and the negotiation led by Gustaf Nobel, on one side, and Walter C. Teagle, on the other, proved to be a profitable masterstroke for the Nobel family.LeVine, Steve (2007): The Oil and the Glory Random House, p. 33-34. Branobel was formally dissolved in 1959 and its last President was Nils Nobel-Oleinikoff, son of Marta Nobel-Oleinikoff and grandson of Ludvig Nobel.

Early life Marlborough was born in England on 13 May 1844. He was the eldest son of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough (1822–1883), who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord President of the Council, and Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane (1822–1899). He was the elder brother of Lord Randolph Churchill and the uncle of Winston Churchill. His paternal grandparents were George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough, and Lady Jane Stewart, daughter of Admiral George Stewart, 8th Earl of Galloway.

After succeeding to the Dukedom, Marlborough sold the family holdings at Wolvercote and Godstow in 1884. Personal life Marlborough was twice married. On 8 November 1869, he was first married to Lady Albertha Frances Anne Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn, at Westminster Palace. She was unkindly described by her mother-in- law as \\"stupid, pious and dull\\". Before they divorced on 20 November 1883, shortly after Marlborough inherited the dukedom after the death of his father, they were the parents of four children: * Lady Frances Louisa Spencer- Churchill (1870–1954), who married Sir Robert Gresley, 11th Baronet, on 6 June 1893, by whom she had issue. * Charles Richard John Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough (1871–1934). * Lady Lillian Maud Spencer-Churchill (1873–1951), who married Colonel Cecil Grenfell on 6 October 1898, by whom she had two daughters. * Lady Norah Beatrice Henriette Spencer-Churchill (1875–1946), who married Francis Bradley Bradley-Birt on 1 December 1920, by whom she had issue. While married to Albertha, he fathered an illegitimate son, initially known as Guy Bertrand and later known as Guy Bertrand Spencer (b. 4 November 1881), by Edith Peers-Williams (d. 1897) who was still married to Heneage Finch, 7th Earl of Aylesford (1849–1885).

Just as Cordelia succeeds at opening Angel up about Doyle and the events surrounding his death, she suffers a vision about an ancient Ethros demon, which turns out to have been possessing a young boy, Ryan Anderson, for years. Angel, Wesley and Cordelia perform an exorcism that expels the demon from the child, but it escapes the trap they set and roams free to possess once more. Even worse, they learn that the mass-murdering Ethros demon does not pose the biggest threat to the Anderson family's well-being. Plot Cordelia finally gets Angel to talk about Doyle's death when she suddenly has a vision. Angel and Wesley go to the envisioned house in the suburbs when a boy named Ryan from the house walks out onto the street. Angel saves him from an oncoming car, and he talks with the parents, Paige and Seth. Noticing that something is off but not sure what is going on, Angel takes advantage of Paige's overflowing gratitude and takes her up on a dinner invitation about which Seth clearly disapproves. Outside, Wesley finds glowing goo called \\"plakticine\\" (similar to ectoplasm) oozing from the foundation all around the house and they realize someone in the house is possessed by a powerful mass- murdering Ethros demon. Angel suspects the father, but the only way to be sure which family member is possessed is to have each ingest eucalyptus powder, which will force the demon to manifest. They mix the powder with brownies that Angel brings to dinner, where Angel watches Seth carefully and it isn't until the daughter Stephanie screams that he sees the demon horrifically manifesting in Ryan before the boy falls unconscious. Paige is frantic and accuses Angel of poisoning her son, but Seth supports Angel, reminding Paige that something has been truly wrong with the boy since long before Angel's advent. They agree to attempt an exorcism and take the boy and his parents back to Angel's place for preparations. Cordelia establishes a magic circle of protection around the bed to bind Ryan there. Stressing that Ryan is not himself anymore, Angel warns Seth and Paige, particularly Paige, that they risk being killed if they break the barrier or go anywhere near the boy. Angel and Wesley try to make contact with the priest reputed to be professionally trained to perform exorcisms but find that he has died and they must attempt the exorcism themselves. Meanwhile, Ryan has seemingly regained consciousness and commences tormenting Paige with guilt at leaving him abandoned and alone in the dark. Her resolve breaks, and when she rushes to his side he begins strangling her; after a tense few minutes, Wesley and Angel rush into the bedroom and manage to pull Paige from Ryan's choke hold, but their efforts send the demon deeper, and the boy again lapses into unconsciousness. Upon learning from Cordelia's research that expelling the demon will send him to the nearest \\"warm body\\", Angel sends her to procure an Ethros box from Rick's Magick & Stuff, which is supposed to hold the Ethros demon. Rick's, however, does not have an Ethros Box, so Cordelia instead buys a box intended for another type of demon. While Cordelia shops, Wesley attempts the exorcism. He manages to raise the demon far enough to animate the boy once more, and the Ethros cruelly taunts him about his inadequacies as a youth and as a Watcher until Wesley grows visibly more distracted and vulnerable. He fails. Someone or something telekinetically uses marbles on the table to write the words, \\"Save me\\". The demon taunts Angel and he wraps his hand with a length of cloth, grabs the cross and Wesley's small volume of incantations, and strides into the bedroom. Holding the cross pressed to Ryan's chest, Angel ignores the pain of his hand sizzling through the protective layers and begins to chant, his voice growing louder and more commanding as he repeats the ritual phrases until, finally, he shouts, \\"Now get the hell out!\\" With an invisible rush, the demon is expelled from the boy, but the box Cordelia bought is unable to contain the demon's energy and shatters. Some time later, after sending the Andersons home, the AI team tries to determine the demon's current whereabouts. They realize the Ethros demon will need to take corporeal form to recharge itself after expending so much energy to escape. Leaving Cordelia behind, Wesley and Angel search the sea caves and find the Ethros demon. They are surprised when the evil being reveals that Ryan is soulless and psychopathic. The demon had been inside the boy, but unable to manifest because of Ryan's naturally evil personality until Ryan ate Angel's brownies. They realize that the \\"save me\\" message was from the demon, and the boy walking in front of the car on the first night was the demon sleepwalking Ryan to kill him. Angel kills the demon swiftly, and he and Wesley realize that the Andersons are in even greater danger now that they believe themselves safe at last. That night in the Andersons' home after everyone is asleep, Ryan, his door unlocked for the first time in a long time, steals matches from Seth's bedstand, then locks his parents' door shut with a toy block. Ignoring his now-awake parents as they struggle to open the door, the boy sloshes gasoline over his sister's toys and furniture, then lights a match and tosses it down. The room ignites with a whoosh, cutting Stephanie off from the door by a wall of flame. Seth and Paige finally burst out and find Ryan staring entranced at the roaring flames while Stephanie screams from behind them. Angel suddenly crashes through the window opposite and scoops Stephanie into his arms as Wesley hustles Ryan and his parents down the hall to safety. A little while later, Angel and Seth stand outside while firemen contain the blaze. Behind Seth, Paige and Stephanie huddle together near the front door. Detective Kate Lockley comes over to inform Seth that Social Services is taking custody of Ryan, and that they can see him in the morning, but that there won't be anything to report until after the evaluation. Angel informs Seth of what he discovered about Ryan and redirects his attention from the son he cannot save to the wife and daughter he has already protected. Almost imperceptibly nodding his thanks, Seth turns to embrace his welcoming family. Angel makes his own way out to the sidewalk. Production =Writing= This was \\"one of the very early scripts that we wrote before Doyle was killed,\\" says writer Tim Minear. He struggled with the story until coming up with the idea that Angel should accidentally call Wesley \\"Doyle\\", which gave the script a cohesive theme about the pain of losing a family member. At the end of the episode Seth Anderson loses his son, and at the beginning Angel has lost someone like a son; Minear says both are \\"desperately trying to keep their family together, and through no fault of their own, they can't.\\" Joss Whedon came up with the twist that Ryan Anderson was more evil than the demon who possessed him. He also cut the priest who, in the first draft of the script, performed the exorcism. Whedon questioned why Wesley couldn't perform the ritual, and Minear says, \\"Suddenly it makes perfect sense, because Angel's problem at the beginning of the story is, 'I let Doyle die... because he did something that I couldn't do.' Now you have Wesley saying, 'I can perform this exorcism; you can't.'\\" When Angel later saves Wesley's life, Minear says \\"he's sort of atoning for the Doyle thing.\\" =Continuity= * Cordelia squabbling in the kitchen with a coworker-turned- friend is so reminiscent of past episodes (e.g., \\"Rm w/a Vu\\"), that Angel actually calls Wesley 'Doyle.' * When Ethros speaks with Doyle's voice, he refers to events in \\"Hero,\\" also discussed earlier the previous day by Cordelia and Angel. * Just as he indicates to Cordelia at the end of \\"Somnambulist,\\" Angel here tells Wesley that being prepared to kill him if he turns evil again is a good thing. * Angel and Wesley each seem to possess a double-bladed Bavarian fighting axe. Cordelia asks Buffy about Angel's in \\"I Will Remember You\\" when, believing Angel Investigations is closing its doors forever, she begins tagging items for inventory. Wesley brings his new one into the office in \\"Expecting,\\" prompting Cordelia's friend Serena to remark, \\"nice ax.\\" * When Angel, Cordelia and Wesley initially suspect that the father is the possessed person, Wesley says that a father \\"doesn't need to be possessed to terrorize his children,\\" then quickly stops talking. This is one of the earliest hints at Wesley's issues with his own father. *This episode marks the second instance of a human being fully or partially soulless; the first was Buffy in \\"Living Conditions.\\" =Cultural references= * I've Got You Under My Skin: This episode shares its title with a song that became a signature of Frank Sinatra. * Lizzie Borden: When Wesley mentions the famous Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her parents with an axe, Angel explains that the Ethros demon possessing her was only an adolescent. * The Exorcist: During the discussion about how to determine which Anderson family member is possessed, Cordelia asks if the demon will manifest by spinning its host's head around. Later, she asks whether Angel wants to protect his bedroom floor, in case there's \\"any big vomiting.\\" These phrases both refer to the film The Exorcist. (Incidentally, Cordelia previously referred to The Exorcist in \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\".) * Thighmaster: When Angel cites Wesley's lack of resistance even to sales suggestion, Wesley protests that his second Thighmaster was a free gift. * Blessed be: Rick the Clerk's greeting to Cordelia is a common Wiccan greeting. * Nestlé Bunny: Paige tries to coax Ryan out of his sulk by invoking this advertising mascot.

Uemura was the eldest son of Tojuiro and Tei, of the family of hatamoto (rank of samurai). His birth name was Michitarō. Though his family was wealthy, they fell into bankruptcy at the time of the Meiji Restoration. He came into contact with Christianity when he went to Tokyo to study at Shubunkan and the preparatory school run by James Hamilton Ballagh. In June 1873 he was baptized at the Yokohama Public Church by Ballagh. His parents and younger brothers were also baptized later. Soon he decided to become an evangelist, studying at Brown Preparatory School and Icchi Shin Gakko (United Seminary). He was ordained in 1880 and became the pastor of Shitaya (Toshimagaoka) church. In 1887 he established the church that would later become Fujimicho Church and served as pastor there for the rest of his life. As an evangelist, his work included: 1. forming evangelical churches; 2. building up an acceptance of a theological way of thinking and the related training of evangelists; and 3. participation in written campaigns opposing many movements in Japanese society (especially the Rescript on Education of 1890). In a life of faith that began in the Public Church and moved to the Japan Presbyterian Church, he provided directional leadership to bring the Christian churches together and help them become self-supporting and independent, based on an evangelical faith (Jesus as the Son of God incarnate, offering redemption through his death on the cross; the resurrection and ascension). Defying the influence of theological liberalism, he, as a professor at Meiji Gakuin, worked to solidify a faith with the above doctrine as its core. In addition, as one of the founders of Tokyo Shingakusha (seminary), he took on the responsibility of the theological education and training of evangelists. Through his own publications, such as Nihon-hyōron (Japanese Criticism), Fukuin-shūhō (The Evangelical Weekly) and others, he engaged in a wide range of literary criticism on such subjects as politics, society, education and religion. His contributions in the areas of Bible translation (into Japanese), hymn editing, literary criticism, and English literature are also of note. His health was greatly damaged because of the strenuous effort he put into the reconstruction of Fujimicho Church and Tokyo Shingakusha after they were devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. He died suddenly at his home in Kashiwagi, Tokyo.taken from Dictionary of Asian Christianity edited by Scott W. Sunquist.

During World War II, he was sent to Manchuria and assigned as a station master along the railway at various locations. When possible he would practice karate and judo, and studied Chinese martial arts with a master of Hakkyoku kempo. He is credited with saving both Chinese and Japanese lives during his stint as station master. After World War II, he returned to Japan to find that the Japanese people were demoralized by the war so he placed a greater emphasis on spiritual development of the individual through karate training. He founded the first Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate dojo in Oshima Park, Hamada village, in Kumamoto prefecture, Kyūshū in 1945. He later relocated the dojo to Shimo- Kitagawa in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward.

Written by Tim Minear and Howard Gordon and directed by Tucker Gates, it was originally broadcast on November 30, 1999 on the WB television network. In \\"Hero\\", Angel joins Doyle’s crusade to save a group of part-human Lister demons from The Scourge, an army of supremacist stormtrooper demons who claim \\"pure\\" blood and consequently persecute those of \\"mixed\\" blood. While Doyle goes after a strayed Lister teen and Cordelia handles details of the escape plan, Angel infiltrates the enemy and discovers their secret weapon, a bomb-like device called the Beacon that combusts anyone with any taint of human blood. Events lead to a climactic showdown aboard a tramp freighter, where Doyle finally confesses his half-demon heritage--and his love for her--to Cordelia, and proves that he, like Angel, is a Champion in his own right. Plot Cordelia and Doyle bicker while working on a video advertising Angel Investigations. After talking to Angel, Doyle has a vision of a group in distress. At the scene of the vision, they find a group of Lister demons hiding from the Scourge, an army of pure-blood demons who hate all demons of mixed blood. Doyle tells Angel about a past encounter with the Scourge. Angel and his team arrange for the Listers to escape on a cargo ship. The Scourge find the Listers' hiding place after they have left for the ship. Angel pretends to join the Scourge, and learns they have a device, the Beacon, which can kill half-breeds from a distance. The Scourge prepares to attack the cargo ship. Doyle and Cordelia flirt while waiting for Angel after Cordelia learns the truth of his heritage and accepts it. Angel arrives, and the ship is preparing to leave when the Scourge appears. Angel attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Beacon as it begins to operate, but Doyle, himself a half-breed demon, knocks Angel out, kisses Cordelia, disables the Beacon, and dies from its effects. Angel and Cordelia later sadly watch the video Doyle had been making. Production details Special effects Supervisor Loni Peristere explains David Greenwalt described his vision of Doyle's death as \\"I want him to melt to death...I want his flesh to melt off and muscle and then bones.\\" Peristere was concerned that that effect would be too graphic for television. He shot Doyle in his demon form, and Doyle with half-burned make-up then used mat elements to digitally \\"chew through his skin\\", including an element of acetone poured on Styrofoam.

He is credited with having worked to prevent the spread of the tropical disease lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis). He principally resided in Auckland, New Zealand, where he was medical director of the Mt Wellington Integrated Family Health Centre. Early life and family Williams was born on Aitutaki on 4 October 1934, and was a descendant of William Marsters of Palmerston Island. He travelled to New Zealand in 1947, and was educated at Northland College after winning a government scholarship. Medical career Williams graduated from Otago Medical School in 1960, and later completed a Masters in Public Health at the University of Hawaii. He returned to the Cook Islands in 1964, where he worked as Medical Superintendent, surgeon, physician, Director of Health and Secretary of Social Services, while also researching tropical diseases, including filariasis. Williams led research and public-health practices that resulted in the Cook Islands meeting “all the criteria required for the World Health Organization (WHO) to acknowledge elimination of LF [lymphatic filariasis] as a public health problem\\". He served as a member of the World Health Organization's executive board from 1995 to 1997 and as a member of the Program Review Group for the Global Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis from 1998 to 2004. In 2002 the Cook Islands Government unsuccessfully nominated Williams to head the World Health Organization. In 1999, Williams was reportedly found by New Zealand's Health and Disability Commissioner to have breached ethical standards when one of his patients was misdiagnosed and given tablets that were past their expiry date. In 2002, Williams became involved in a controversy regarding a proposed medical trial in the Cook Islands. The trial, which involved injecting pig cells into humans as a means of fighting diabetes, could not legally take place in New Zealand, and therefore moved to the Cook Islands, where less strict regulations applied. Williams, a strong supporter of the proposal, believed that it would bring benefits to the Cook Islands' economy, but the scheme aroused much controversy. In 2015 Williams published a book based on his clinical experience in treating eczema. Despite public support from some of his patients in 2018 Williams was fined NZ$10,000 plus NZ$145,000 in court costs, and required to practise under supervision for three years, after using unapproved treatments for eczema. Political career Williams was first elected to the Cook Islands Parliament as a Cook Islands Party candidate for the electorate of Aitutaki in the 1968 election. He served as Minister of Health and Education from 1974 to 1978 in the government of Albert Henry, as well as being Henry's personal physician. As Health Minister, he supported Czech cancer therapist Milan Brych relocating his clinic to the Cook Islands, despite Brych being removed from the medical register in New Zealand. He was one of three prominent CIP members to have left the party immediately before the 1978 election, and subsequently contested the Arorangi electorate for the Unity Party, but lost his seat. Williams subsequently migrated to New Zealand. He rejoined the Cook Islands Party and was re-elected in the 1994 election as its candidate for the overseas seat, representing Cook Islanders living abroad (mostly in New Zealand). He served as Minister of Health, Tourism, Transport, and State-Owned Enterprises from 1994 to 1996. Although a member of the Cook Islands Party, he opposed the premiership (1989 to 1999) of Geoffrey Henry, the party's leader from 1979 to 2006. Many members of the Cook Islands Party opposed its coalition agreement with the New Alliance Party, and after several defections, Henry lost control to the dissidents and resigned. In July 1999, Williams narrowly won endorsement as the new prime minister. This prompted considerable anger in some quarters, primarily because Williams mostly lived outside the islands. In October 1999 the New Alliance Party left the governing coalition, depriving the government of its majority. Williams attempted to form a new government, but the following month he lost a vote of no-confidence to the opposition Democratic Alliance Party and the New Alliance Party. Terepai Maoate became the new prime minister. He lost his seat when the overseas electorate was abolished in 2003. Williams later attempted to start a political career in New Zealand, standing as a candidate for the New Zealand First party at 15th place in the party list and contesting the Maungakiekie electorate seat in the 2005 parliamentary elections. He did not succeed in becoming an MP, as he placed third in Maungakiekie and New Zealand First received only seven seats. Williams re-entered New Zealand politics before the 2017 New Zealand general election, founding the One Pacific Movement. One Pacific later reached a deal with the Māori Party under which it ran Pasifika candidates on the Māori Party list. Honours Williams was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and the Pasifika Medical Association Service Award in 2004. He was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order, for services to the Cook Islands community, in the 2011 New Zealand New Year Honours. In 2015 Williams was named inaugural Patron of the Pasifika Medical Association and in 2016 he received the World Health Organisation's Award of Appreciation for his contribution to eliminating lymphatic filariasis. Death Williams was hospitalised in Auckland on 13 August 2020 after testing positive for COVID-19. He died on 4 September 2020 at the age of 85 because of the virus.

There has been an age-long contention on this issue between the locals of Aguluezechukwu and Ekwulobia, with both towns claiming the status of the headquarters on account of ownership claim to the 'Aguata land'. This state of affairs caused the Government of Anambra State to officially declare that the headquarters of Aguata Local Government Area should be Aguata (the neuter name of the location in which the headquarters of Aguata Local Government Area Offices are sited) in a bid to settle the conflict. Ekwulobia Ekwulobia, the largest town in Aguata, is expanding rapidly to a population of about 100,000 people. It is the major commercial town in the area. Most Nigerian commercial banks maintain their branches there. It also boasts a small sized stadium, a federal prison (part of which falls into Ezinifite), and a major market, Eke Market. Several new agricultural factories established around Ekwulobia town have also attracted workers. Ekwulobia is also a major transit hub from which travellers can connect to other far-flung cities in Nigeria. There is public transport that runs from Ekwulobia daily to Onitsha, Awka, Port Harcourt, Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Abakaliki, etc. In the area of hospitality business, the town has a few hotels, such as Orthon Palace Hotels, and in recent times, the Chicago Hotel, Vonic Hotel and resort,https://heyhotels.com.ng/03920/Vonic_Hotel_and_Resort and Logart Hills Hotel.

He travelled across Europe, took part in military campaigns led by the Earl of Essex, and was a participant of Essex's rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I. He was favoured by James I, and honoured by his contemporaries as a man of great intelligence and talent. He enjoyed the friendship of some of the most prominent writers and artists of the Elizabethan age and Jacobean age. In 1603 he led an Embassy to Denmark, homeland of James' Queen Anne of Denmark. Evidence indicates that Manners was a patron of the architect Inigo Jones and probably introduced Jones to the Court of James I and Anne of Denmark, where Jones had his impact as both on Jacobean architecture and as a designer of Court masques.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance, London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; pp. 16, 23, 55, 111. Life He was born probably at Kirk Deighton, Yorkshire, where he was baptized on 19 November 1576.Danushevskaya (2001) p. 204. Manners' uncle, Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland had died 14 April 1587. He passed the Earldom of Rutland and Barony of Manners to his brother, John, but the Barony de Ros went to his only child, daughter Elizabeth.Although Rutland was styled Lord Ros before he attained the earldom, because the barony came into the Manners family through the female line and the provisions of the 3rd Earl's will, it was disputed whether the barony descended through the heirs general or the male heir, and both sides claimed the title. After a long legal dispute, in 1616 it was decided that the Barony of Ros would descend through Elizabeth, the 3rd Earl of Rutland's daughter, as his only heir according to the instructions in his will.(Danushevskaya, 2001, n. 566, p. 205.) The 4th Earl died less than a year later, on 24 February 1588, passing the title on to his son. This meant that Rutland's inheritance was complicated by the demands of two wills and jointures for two dowager countesses and disputes between them. Since he was 11 when his father died, he became a royal ward of Queen Elizabeth. His wardship was originally promised to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, but Dudley died on 4 September 1588 and Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the Queen's Secretary of State and chief advisor, became his guardian. His cousin, Elizabeth Manners, had been placed in Burghley's household after the death of her father.Hammer (2004). From late 1587, Rutland was educated under the supervision of John Jegon at Queens' College, Cambridge and later at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He was at Cambridge when he received the news of his father's death,HCM (1888) pp. 241–2. and he returned home for his father's funeral, where he remained until mid-May 1588, after Burghley insisted he return to Cambridge to continue his education.Danushevskaya (2001) p. 206. Rutland received his MA on 20 February 1595, in a grand ceremony planned and managed by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, the Queen's then-favourite and the late Dudley's stepson. Rutland soon became a follower of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. This was to cause him serious problems when he became implicated in the Essex Rebellion of 1601. Rutland was imprisoned for several months and was fined the \\"staggering\\" amount of £30000, three times more than any other conspirator. He was taken to the Tower of London but allowed to bring his own furnishings, including a suite of tapestry from the Great Chamber of Haddon Hall.Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland preserved at Belvoir castle, vol. 1 (London, 1905), p. 365. In order to pay the debt he was forced to sell land, causing a major argument with his mother, who refused to accept the loss of family estates. After the accession of James I, Rutland's position improved somewhat, but remained difficult. His wife Elizabeth was humiliated in 1605 when a goldsmith had her arrested for debt. Marriage He married Elizabeth Sidney (d. 1612), daughter of Sir Philip Sidney and stepdaughter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, on 5 March 1599. The marriage was childless, and is widely believed to have been unhappy. It has been speculated that the marriage was not consummated, possibly because Rutland had syphilis, which may also have been the cause of Rutland's rapidly declining health in his last years.Margaret P. Hannay, Mary Sidney Lady Wroth, Ashgate Publishing, 2013, p.163. Death Tomb for Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland and his wife Countess Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Sidney in St. Mary's church He died in 1612 at the age of 35, and his titles passed to his brother, Francis Manners. In 1618-19, Gerard Johnson the elder built a tomb in St Mary the Virgin's Church at Bottesford, Leicestershire commemorating the fifth earl and his wife. Rutland's mother had previously commissioned Johnson to erect two monuments commemorating the 3rd and 4th earls in 1591.Llewellyn, Nigel. Funeral Monuments in Post-Reformation England. (2000) Cambridge University Press, p. 139. . Shakespeare authorship In the early 20th century, Roger Manners was proposed as a candidate for the authorship of Shakespeare's literary work in the Shakespearean authorship question. His candidacy was first suggested by Burkhard Herrmann (using the pseudonym \\"Peter Alvor\\") in 1906, who argued that Rutland collaborated with the Earl of Southampton to create the works. Rutland wrote the comedies, the narrative poems and the sonnets. The theory was adopted by other writers, who dropped Southampton as a collaborator.Campbell, Oscar James, ed (1966), A Shakespeare Encyclopedia, London: Methuen, pp.730–731. It was most vigorously promoted by the German critic Karl Bleibtreu (1907), and later supported by a number of other authors, including Lewis Frederick Bostelmann (1909), the Belgian politician Célestin Demblon (1912) and the Russian writers Pyotr Sergeevich Porokhovshchikov (1940) and Ilya Gililov (2003).

As a special case, :{\\\\partial \\\\det(A) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ij}. Equivalently, if stands for the differential of , the general formula is : d \\\\det (A) = \\\\operatorname{tr} (\\\\operatorname{adj}(A) \\\\, dA). It is named after the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Derivation =Via Matrix Computation= We first prove a preliminary lemma: Lemma. Let A and B be a pair of square matrices of the same dimension n. Then :\\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j A_{ij} B_{ij} = \\\\operatorname{tr} (A^{\\\\rm T} B). Proof. The product AB of the pair of matrices has components :(AB)_{jk} = \\\\sum_i A_{ji} B_{ik}. Replacing the matrix A by its transpose AT is equivalent to permuting the indices of its components: :(A^{\\\\rm T} B)_{jk} = \\\\sum_i A_{ij} B_{ik}. The result follows by taking the trace of both sides: :\\\\operatorname{tr} (A^{\\\\rm T} B) = \\\\sum_j (A^{\\\\rm T} B)_{jj} = \\\\sum_j \\\\sum_i A_{ij} B_{ij} = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j A_{ij} B_{ij}.\\\\ \\\\square Theorem. (Jacobi's formula) For any differentiable map A from the real numbers to n × n matrices, : d \\\\det (A) = \\\\operatorname{tr} (\\\\operatorname{adj}(A) \\\\, dA). Proof. Laplace's formula for the determinant of a matrix A can be stated as :\\\\det(A) = \\\\sum_j A_{ij} \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T} (A)_{ij}. Notice that the summation is performed over some arbitrary row i of the matrix. The determinant of A can be considered to be a function of the elements of A: :\\\\det(A) = F\\\\,(A_{11}, A_{12}, \\\\ldots , A_{21}, A_{22}, \\\\ldots , A_{nn}) so that, by the chain rule, its differential is :d \\\\det(A) = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j {\\\\partial F \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} \\\\,dA_{ij}. This summation is performed over all n×n elements of the matrix. To find ∂F/∂Aij consider that on the right hand side of Laplace's formula, the index i can be chosen at will. (In order to optimize calculations: Any other choice would eventually yield the same result, but it could be much harder). In particular, it can be chosen to match the first index of ∂ / ∂Aij: :{\\\\partial \\\\det(A) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = {\\\\partial \\\\sum_k A_{ik} \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\sum_k {\\\\partial (A_{ik} \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik}) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} Thus, by the product rule, :{\\\\partial \\\\det(A) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\sum_k {\\\\partial A_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} + \\\\sum_k A_{ik} {\\\\partial \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}}. Now, if an element of a matrix Aij and a cofactor adjT(A)ik of element Aik lie on the same row (or column), then the cofactor will not be a function of Aij, because the cofactor of Aik is expressed in terms of elements not in its own row (nor column). Thus, :{\\\\partial \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = 0, so :{\\\\partial \\\\det(A) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\sum_k \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} {\\\\partial A_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}}. All the elements of A are independent of each other, i.e. :{\\\\partial A_{ik} \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\delta_{jk}, where δ is the Kronecker delta, so :{\\\\partial \\\\det(A) \\\\over \\\\partial A_{ij}} = \\\\sum_k \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ik} \\\\delta_{jk} = \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ij}. Therefore, :d(\\\\det(A)) = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j \\\\operatorname{adj}^{\\\\rm T}(A)_{ij} \\\\,d A_{ij}, and applying the Lemma yields :d(\\\\det(A)) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\operatorname{adj}(A) \\\\,dA).\\\\ \\\\square =Via Chain Rule= Lemma 1. \\\\det'(I)=\\\\mathrm{tr}, where \\\\det' is the differential of \\\\det. This equation means that the differential of \\\\det, evaluated at the identity matrix, is equal to the trace. The differential \\\\det'(I) is a linear operator that maps an n × n matrix to a real number. Proof. Using the definition of a directional derivative together with one of its basic properties for differentiable functions, we have :\\\\det'(I)(T)= abla_T \\\\det(I)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}\\\\frac{\\\\det(I+\\\\varepsilon T)-\\\\det I}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\det(I+\\\\varepsilon T) is a polynomial in \\\\varepsilon of order n. It is closely related to the characteristic polynomial of T. The constant term (\\\\varepsilon = 0) is 1, while the linear term in \\\\varepsilon is \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\ T. Lemma 2. For an invertible matrix A, we have: \\\\det'(A)(T)=\\\\det A \\\\; \\\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1}T). Proof. Consider the following function of X: :\\\\det X = \\\\det (A A^{-1} X) = (\\\\det A) \\\\ \\\\det(A^{-1} X) We calculate the differential of \\\\det X and evaluate it at X = A using Lemma 1, the equation above, and the chain rule: :\\\\det'(A)(T) = \\\\det A \\\\ \\\\det'(I) (A^{-1} T) = \\\\det A \\\\ \\\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1} T) Theorem. (Jacobi's formula) \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det A = \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{adj}\\\\ A\\\\frac{dA}{dt}\\\\right) Proof. If A is invertible, by Lemma 2, with T = dA/dt :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det A = \\\\det A \\\\; \\\\mathrm{tr} \\\\left(A^{-1} \\\\frac{dA}{dt}\\\\right) = \\\\mathrm{tr} \\\\left( \\\\mathrm{adj}\\\\ A \\\\; \\\\frac{dA}{dt} \\\\right) using the equation relating the adjugate of A to A^{-1}. Now, the formula holds for all matrices, since the set of invertible linear matrices is dense in the space of matrices. Corollary The following is a useful relation connecting the trace to the determinant of the associated matrix exponential: This statement is clear for diagonal matrices, and a proof of the general claim follows. For any invertible matrix A(t), in the previous section \\"Via Chain Rule\\", we showed that :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det A(t) = \\\\det A(t) \\\\; \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left(A(t)^{-1} \\\\, \\\\frac{d}{dt} A(t)\\\\right) Considering A(t) = \\\\exp(tB) in this equation yields: : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det e^{tB} =\\\\operatorname{tr}(B) \\\\det e^{tB} The desired result follows as the solution to this ordinary differential equation. Applications Several forms of the formula underlie the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm for computing the characteristic polynomial, and explicit applications of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. For example, starting from the following equation, which was proved above: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det A(t) = \\\\det A(t) \\\\ \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left(A(t)^{-1} \\\\, \\\\frac{d}{dt} A(t)\\\\right) and using A(t) = t I - B, we get: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\det (tI-B) = \\\\det (tI-B) \\\\operatorname {tr}[(tI-B)^{-1}] = \\\\operatorname{tr}[\\\\operatorname{adj} (tI-B)] where adj denotes the adjugate matrix.

Biography Rincón Gallardo was born in Mexico City into an upper-class family descendant of the Marquess of Guadalupe and Count of Regla, and composed of Gilberto Rincón Gallardo Gallardo and Blanca Meltis González. At age 19 he became involved in politics when he joined the 1958 presidential campaign of Luis H. Álvarez, a prominent figure of the conservative National Action Party. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and following his participation in several railroad workers' protests, he shifted politically to the left, where he participated in several political parties (some of which he represented at the Chamber of Deputies). With Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, Heberto Castillo and others he co-founded the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which he left in the nineties arguing that its internal political struggles and dogmatism had frustrated any chance of becoming a modern socialist party. Subsequently, he went on to build the Social Democracy Party (in Spanish: Partido Democracia Social) an institution that tried to introduce the Social Democracy ideology in Mexico, but failed to keep its official recognition by some 20,000 votes in the 2000 federal elections in which he ran as the party's presidential candidate. In spite of the results, three years later he relaunched his platform as the Party of the Rose (Partido de la Rosa), which couldn't achieve official recognition because the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) refused to recognize its statutes. Rincón Gallardo built an impressive legal team led by former general prosecutor Jorge Carpizo McGregor to challenge its decision but eventually failed to change the verdict. As an activist, his harsh criticism to the Mexican government in the 1970s prompted several acts of repression and a political incarceration in the midst of the Mexican dirty war. Since he was born with a physical disability (shortened arms as the result of a birth defect), he also advocated better public policies toward the disabled and other social minorities. Then-President Vicente Fox appointed him president of the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (Consejo Nacional para Prevenir la Discriminación, CONAPRED) on 11 July 2003. He was confirmed by President Felipe Calderón in 2006 and held the position until his death. Following ten days of hospitalization, Rincón Gallardo died in Mexico City on 30 August 2008 at age 69. He was survived by his wife, Silvia Pavón Hampshire.

It is the central church of the Lutheran Archdiocese of Turku and the seat of the Lutheran Archbishop of Finland, Tapio Luoma. It is also regarded as one of the major records of Finnish architectural history. Considered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the river Aura. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. The cathedral was originally built out of wood in the late 13th century, and was dedicated as the main cathedral of Finland in 1300, the seat of the Catholic bishop of Turku. It was considerably expanded in the 14th and 15th centuries, mainly using stone as the construction material. The cathedral was badly damaged during the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, and was rebuilt to a great extent afterwards.  History  Turku Cathedral plan. Turku Cathedral cross section. As the town of Turku began to emerge in the course of the 13th century as the most important trading centre in Finland, the Bishop's see of the Diocese of Finland was transferred from its previous location at Koroinen, some distance further up on the bank of Aura river, to the middle of the town. By the end of the 13th century, a new stone church had been completed on the site of the former wooden-built parish church on Unikankare Mound, and it was consecrated in 1300 as the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Henry, the first Bishop of Finland. At its earliest the cathedral was smaller than the present building. Its east front was where the pulpit stands now, and its roof was considerably lower than at the moment. Extensions were made to the cathedral throughout the Middle Ages. During the 14th century a new choir was added, from which the octagonal Gothic pillars in the present chancel originate. Throughout the Middle Ages, the High Altar was located opposite the easternmost pillars of the nave, until it was transferred to its present location in the apse, in what had previously been the Chapel of All Saints, in the mid-17th century. During the 15th century, side-chapels were added along the north and south sides of the nave, containing altars dedicated to various saints. By the end of the Middle Ages these numbered 42 in total. The roof-vaults were also raised during the latter part of the 15th century to their present height of 24 meters. Thus, by the beginning of the Modern era, the church had approximately taken on its present shape. The major later addition to the cathedral is the tower, which has been rebuilt several times, as a result of repeated fires. The worst damage was caused by the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, when most of the town was destroyed, along with the interior of both the tower and the nave and the old tower roof. The present spire of the tower, constructed after the great fire, reaches a height of 101 meters above sea level, and is visible over a considerable distance as the symbol of both the cathedral and the city of Turku itself. In the reformation the cathedral was taken by the Lutheran Church of Finland (Sweden). Most of the present interior also dates from the restoration carried out in the 1830s, following the Great Fire. The altarpiece, depicting the Transfiguration of Jesus, was painted in 1836 by the Swedish artist Fredrik Westin. The reredos behind the High Altar, and the pulpit in the crossing, also both date from the 1830s, and were designed by german architect Carl Ludvig Engel, known in Finland for his several other highly regarded works. The walls and roof in the chancel are decorated with frescos in the Romantic style by the court painter Robert Wilhelm Ekman, which depict events from the life of Jesus, and the two key events in the history of the Finnish Church: the baptism of the first Finnish Christians by Bishop Henry by the spring at Kupittaa, and the presentation to King Gustav Vasa by the Reformer Michael Agricola of the first Finnish translation of the New Testament. The cathedral houses three organs. The current main organ of the cathedral was built by Veikko Virtanen Oy of Espoo, Finland, in 1980 and features 81 ranks with a mechanical action.

Pre-production  : Work before shooting begins is called the pre-production stage. The crew in this stage include the casting director, costume designer, director, location manager, make-up artist, researcher, screenwriter, set designer, and television producer. =Casting director= : The casting director casts actors, and so is usually one of the first crew members on the project. In fact, during initial casting for a television pilot, the executive producer and casting director are often the only crew members. =Costume designer= : The costume designer makes all the clothing and costumes worn by all the Actors on screen, as well as designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colours, and sizes. They greatly contribute to the appearance of the production, and set a particular mood, time, feeling, or genre. They alter the overall appearance of a project with their designs and constructions, including impacting on the style of the project, and how the audience interprets the show's characters. =Director= : A television director is usually responsible for directing the actors and other filmed aspects of a television production. The role differs from that of a film director because the major creative control usually belongs to the producer. In general, actors and other regular artists on a show are familiar enough with their roles that the director's input is confined to technical issues. The director is responsible for all creative aspects of a production. The director typically helps hire the cast (and possibly crew). The Director helps decide on locations, and creates a shooting plan. During shooting, the director supervises the overall project, manages shots, and keeps the assignment on budget and schedule. Though directors hold much power, they are second in command after the producer. The producer usually hires the director (unless the director is also the producer). Some directors produce their own television programs, and, with formal approval of the funding studio, enjoy a tighter grip on what makes the final cut than Directors usually have. * Associate director (AD) : An associate director (AD) in television production is usually responsible for floor directing in the studio and ensuring that the sets, props and technical equipment are safe, ready to use and positioned correctly before filming. Associate directors are also responsible for communications with the audience and any guests, for example ensuring they are seated in good time, and assisting the Director with production. In scripted television series, an associate director occasionally serves as an episode's director, in which case someone else substitutes for the AD. Until the mid-2000s in the United States, associate directors were usually credited as technical coordinators, for most sitcoms were shot on film. Drama programs don't usually use ADs. =Location manager= : The location manager finds and manages film locations. Most pictures are shot in the controllable environment of a studio sound stage but occasionally, outdoor sequences call for filming on location. =Make-up artist= : A professional make-up artist is usually a cosmetology beautician, and applies makeup to anyone who appears on screen. They concentrate on the area above the chest, the face, the top of the head, the fingers, hands, arms, and elbows. Their role is to manipulate the actor's on-screen appearance to make them look younger, older, larger, etc. : Body makeup artists concentrate on the body rather than the head. Make-up itself is substances to enhance the beauty of the human body, but can also change the appearance, disguise, or costume someone. Make-up artists, hair stylists, costume designers, and dress technicians combine their efforts to transform actors into characters, presenters, etc. =Production designer= : The production designer is responsible for the production's visual appearance.They design, plan, organize, and arrange set design, equipment availability, and control a production's on-screen appearance. The production designer is often called the set designer, or scenic designer. They are trained professionals, often with Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees in scenic design. The set designer collaborates with the theater director to create an environment for the production—and communicates details of this environment to the technical director, charge scenic artist and property master. Scenic designers create drawings and scale models of the scenery. The set designer also takes instructions from the art director to create the appearance of the stage, and design its technical assembly. The art director, who may also be the production designer, plans and oversees the formation of settings for a project. They must be well versed in art and design styles, including architecture and interior design. They also work with the Cinematographer to accomplish the precise appearance for the project. =Researcher= : Researchers research the project ahead of shooting time to increase truth, factual content, creative content, original ideas, background information, and sometimes performs minor searches such as flight details, location conditions, accommodation details, etc. They inform the director, producer, and writer of factual information—technical, cultural, historical, etc.—that relates to events that the production portrays. =Set designer= The scenic designer collaborates with the theatre director and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production, and then communicates details of this environment to the technical director, production manager, charge artist, and property master. Scenic designers create scale models of the scenery, artistic renderings, paint elevations, and scale construction drawings to communicate with other production staff. =Television producer= : In the entertainment industry, a television producer (compare to film producer) is generally in charge of, or helps coordinate, the financial, legal, administrative, technological, and artistic aspects of a production. In television, a television producer can be given one of the following titles: * Associate producer : The associate producer performs limited producing functions under the authority of a producer; often in charge of the day-to-day running of a production. Usually the producer's head assistant, although the task can differ. They frequently form a connection between everyone involved in shooting (the production team) and the people involved after filming to finalize the production, and get it publicized (the post-production team). Occasionally, credit for this role goes to the product's financial backer, or the person who originally brought the assignment to the producer. * Assistant Producer (AP) : In the UK, assistant producer is the closest role to that of a film director. An assistant producer often doubles as an experienced researcher, and takes direct charge of the creative content and action within a programme. The title of television director is usually reserved for dramatic programming, productions and most similar to films, or those who control a multi-camera set up from the gallery. * Co-producer : Typically performs producing functions in tandem with one or more other co-producers (working as a team, rather than separately on different aspects of the production). * Coordinating producer : The coordinating producer coordinates the work of two or more producers working separately on one or more productions. * Executive producer : The executive producer supervises one or more producers in all aspects of their work, and sometimes initiated the production. They are usually the ultimate authority on creative and business aspects of the production. If the title is designated correctly, the executive producer arranges the project's financial backing and maintains a sound production budget. On scripted programs, the showrunner receives an executive producer credit. * Line producer : A line producer supervises physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects), including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. The line producer oversees the budget. This involves operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The Line Producer works with the Production manager on costs and expenditure. * Segment producer : Produces one or more components of a multipart production. * Supervising producer : Supervises one or more producers in some or all aspects of their work; usually works under the authority of an executive producer. Additionally, more senior members of a television show's writing staff are credited as producers, with the specific title dependent upon the seniority and rate of pay for the writer. For example, a writer credited as a \\"co-executive producer\\" will typically receive a higher salary and be considered more senior than a writer credited as a \\"producer\\", who will in turn be higher \\"ranking\\" than a writer credited as \\"co-producer.\\"http://www.scriptmag.com/features/writers-room-101-tv-writer- job-titles =Writer= : The Writer creates and moulds an original story, or adapts other written, told, or acted stories for production of a television show. Their finished work is called a script. A script may also have been a contribution of many writers, so it is the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) task to designate who gets the credit as 'the Writer'. 'Written by' in the credits, is a Writers Guild of America assigned terminology that means, \\"Original Story and Screenplay By.\\" A screenplay or script is a blueprint for producing a motion picture, and a teleplay is the same thing for a television show. Writers can also come under the category of screenwriters. Screenwriters (also called script writers), are authors who write screenplays for productions. Many also work as script doctors, changing scripts to suit directors or studios. Script-doctoring can be lucrative, especially for better known writers. Most professional screenwriters are unionized, and are represented by organizations such as the WGA. =Head writer= : A head writer oversees the writing team on a television or radio series. The title is common in the soap opera genre, and in sketch comedies and talk shows that feature monologues and comedy skits. In prime time series, an executive producer fills this function. =Screenwriter= Screenwriters or scenarists or scriptwriters create short or feature-length screenplays for films and television programs. =Story editor= : Story editor is a job title in motion picture filmmaking and television production, also sometimes called supervising producer. A story editor is a member of the screenwriting staff who edits stories for screenplays. Production : Everything that happens as part of shooting the film is part of the production stage. The crew in this stage include the cinematographer, production manager, technical director, boom operator, gaffer, dolly grip, key grip, and stunt coordinator. =A1= In television and live event production, the A1 is the primary audio engineer responsible for the technical design and operation of associated sound systems (e.g. mixers, microphones, intercom, IFB, RF equipment, PA/monitoring, music/sfx playback, multi-track recording, and more). Generally speaking, the A1 supervises all audio crew members during build, rehearsal, and show phases of any production. Ultimately, the A1 will have routed, recorded, and mixed all sound sources heard during the program broadcast. =A2= The A2 helps get microphones or other audio devices to the right place or to the right person : An audio assistant (A2) positions and interconnects audio devices, such as microphones and intercoms, from the television production truck to the venue. Typically, larger productions use two or more A2s. =Boom operator= : The boom operator is part of the sound crew, and an assistant to the sound engineer or production sound mixer. The boom operator's main responsibility is microphone placement, sometimes using a \\"fishpole\\" with a microphone attached to the end—and sometimes using a \\"boom\\" (most often a \\"fisher boom\\"). The fisher boom is a piece of equipment that the operator stands on that lets him precisely control the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They also place wireless microphones on actors when necessary. The boom operator strives to keep the microphone boom near the action, but away from the camera frame so it never appears onscreen. They work closely with the production sound mixer, or sound recordist, to record all sound while filming including background noises, dialogue, sound effects, and silence. =Camera operator/cinematographer/videographer= : As the head member of the camera crew, the camera operator uses the camera as instructed by the Director. They ensure the required action is correctly filmed in the frame, and must react instinctively as the proceedings take place. If the camera operator is also a cinematographer, they also help establish the theme and appearance of the show. The cinematographer—or director of photography (DP)—regulates lighting for every scene, frames some shots, chooses lenses, decides on film stock, and strives to match the project's visual appearance to the director's vision. However, the cinematographer does not usually move the camera on the set, as this is usually the exclusive role of a camera operator. =Character generator operator/Aston/Duet operator= : The character generator (CG) Operator prepares and displays digital on-screen graphics (DOG or BUG) and lower third graphics on the character generator that were created by the broadcast designer. =Floor manager= : The floor manager represents the director on the studio floor, and gives instructions and direction to crew, cast, and guests. It is closest to the role of an assistant director, as the job frequently entails barking orders to keep a production on schedule. The floor manager is always in direct contact with the director via talkback in the gallery. The floor manager also checks that the floor is clear and safe for the performance, checks that scenery and set pieces are ready, turns on appropriate lights, makes announcements to staff and audience, helps maintain quietness and order, calls cues, and prompts talents as required. They also provide cues, timing and other information to the presenters and talents. * Assistant floor manager : An assistant floor manager (AFM) sets the stage, prompts contributors on the studio floor, and ensures that everyone knows their place in the script. This frees the floor manager for other duties. They often oversee a team of runners. Increasingly, assistant floor managers are asked to help design and prepare props, and help set and reset action on the studio floor. =Graphics coordinator= : The graphics coordinator (GC) decides what graphic content should be displayed on-air—such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a lower third (a bar graphic in the lower third of the screen). The GC should not be confused with the Duet operator, who usually operates the Duet and is part of a television crew, or a Broadcast designer who physically creates the graphics. =Stage manager= : Stage managers organize and coordinate theatrical productions. The job encompasses a variety of activities, including organizing the production and coordinating communications between various personnel (e.g., between director and backstage crew, or actors and production management). Stage management is a sub- discipline of stagecraft. =Gaffer= : The gaffer is the head electrician at the production set, and is in charge of lighting the stage under direction of the Cinematographer. In television, the term chief lighting director is often used instead of gaffer, and sometimes the technical director lights the set. The gaffer reports to the director of photography, lighting director. or lighting designer, and usually has an assistant called a best boy and a crew of electricians. =Grip (job)= : In the U.S. and Canada, grips are lighting and rigging technicians in the film and video industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or camera cranes. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot under the direction of the director of photography. * Key grip : The 'key grip is the head grip. Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and occasionally maneuver camera cranes, dollies, and platforms under direction from the Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who is also part of the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer. * Dolly grip : In cinematography, the dolly grip places and moves the dolly track where required, and then pushes and pulls the dolly along that track during filming. A dolly grip works closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements through rehearsals. For moving shots, dolly grips may also push the wheeled platform that holds the microphone and Boom Operator. The dolly is a cart that the tripod and camera (and occasionally the camera crew) rest on. It transports the camera without bumps and visual interruptions throughout a shot. It is commonly used to follow beside an actor to give the audience the sense of walking with the actor, or as the actor. =Gallery/control room team= : These crew positions are only used on a multiple-camera setup production. The gallery, or production control room, is a separate darkened area away from the studio floor, where the action can be viewed on multiple monitors and controlled from a single source. =Production manager= : The production manager makes deals concerned with business about the crew, and organizes the technical needs of the production. This would involve many things ranging from gaining the correct equipment with the exact technical requirements; to arranging accommodation for the cast and crew. The production manager reports their expenses and needs to the Line Producer. =Production assistant= : The production assistant (PA) occupies a prompting role in the Gallery or Control Room. They communicate with the broadcasting channel during a live television broadcast, counting down time- to-transmission aloud to the crew via the studio microphone. They also count down time remaining for sections of a programme, such as an interview or an advertising break. Prior to a production, the PA prepares and times the script, noting pre-recorded inserts, sound effects, etc.—and clears copyright and other administrative issues. =Runner= : Runners are the most junior members of a television crew. They fetch and carry, and do most production odd jobs. They support anyone who needs help until they learn enough to assume more responsibility. In the United States, this position is called a gofer. =Stunt coordinator= :Where the programme requires a stunt, and involves the use of stunt performers, the stunt coordinator arranges casting and performance for the stunt, working closely with the television director. =Technical director= : In a production control room (PCR), the technical director (TD) has overall responsibility for the operation of the production. The technical director ensures that all equipment in the PCR operates correctly. They also match the quality and the output of all the cameras on the studio floor through the camera control units (CCU) (vision engineering). The TD supervises the other crew members in the PCR. The technical director also coordinates the working of the whole crew, and handles technical problem before, during, or after the shooting of a project. =Television director – director= : Unlike the film counterpart, a director in television usually refers to the gallery (or control room) director, who is responsible for the creative look of a production through selecting which shots to use at any given moment. The director views the action on the studio floor through a bank of screens, each linked to one of the cameras, while issuing instructions down to the floor manager. They also control the gallery area, calling for sound rolls, digital on-screen graphics (Astons) and video rolls video tape recorder (VT's). Some directors also work more closely with on-camera talent and others also act as both producer and director. =Presentation officer/Video control operator/vision engineering= : A video control operator (typically credited as video control, and sometimes as a video engineer or video operator) controls the video console to regulate transmission of content—everything from test patterns to live and recorded telecasts. Video control operators view the action on set through video monitors and set switches and observe dials on the video console to control contrast, framing, brilliance, color balance, and the fidelity of the transmitted image. They monitor the program to ensure broadcast technical quality, and review the program to determine that the signal functions properly and is ready for transmission on schedule. Video control operators and video tape operators are used only in television productions recorded on video tape because of the growing use of broadcast automation with video servers. =Camera control unit operator= : A Camera control unit operator (typically credited as CCU operator) controls the camera control unit, which is a series of camera remote controls for exposure, white balance, and contrast, to regulate the picture quality between multiple cameras. =Video tape operator= : The video tape operator (VT operator or VTR operator) cues and prepares video inserts into a program. A VT operator sets up and operates video tape equipment to record and play back the program, reads the program log to ascertain when to record the program, and when it airs. They also select sources, such as satellite or studio, for the program, and select the video recording equipment to use. They are heavily used in sports programming, and in all video taped productions, including television news programming, and sometimes sitcoms, if they are shot on video tape), they are also responsible for action replays and quickly editing highlights while a show is in progress. As the title suggests, video tape operators only work in video taped production. Although, VTR operator's still work on digital productions. It is a name that has just stuck to the playback operator. They can also be on set editors to give the director and director of photography the ability to see how what they shot cuts together. =Vision mixer= : The vision mixer, or technical director (TD) in the United States, switches between video sources—such as camera shots and video inserts. They also maintain colour and contrast balance between the studio cameras. A vision mixer (Video Switcher) is, confusingly, also the name of the equipment the technical director operates. Post-production : Everything after shooting of a film is post production. People involved in this stage of production include the film editor for film editing, video editor for video editing, publicist for publicity, sound editor, Foley artist, composer, title sequence designer, and specialist editors. =Colorist= :The colorist interprets the program's visual look, often supervised by post-production producers and the cinematographer. Digital tools in the color grading suite control brightness, contrast, color, and the general \\"mood\\" of each shot, usually in an effort to make a scene appear to flow naturally from one shot to the next. =Composer= : A composer writes the music for a production. They may also conduct an orchestra, or part of an orchestra, that plays the music. The composer occasionally writes theme music for a television show. A television program's theme music is a melody closely associated with the show, usually played during the title sequence and end closing credits. If accompanied by lyrics, it is a theme song. =Editor= Editor in linear suite : The editor works in tandem with the director to edit raw footage into a finished work. The director has ultimate accountability for editing choices, but often the editor contributes substantially to the creative decisions concerned in piecing together a finalized product. Often the editor commences their role whilst filming is still in process, by compiling initial takes of footage. It is an extremely long process to edit a television show, demonstrating the importance, and significance editing has on a production. Gradually more editors work on non-linear editing systems (NLE), limiting physical touching of the actual film, decreasing film corruption due to touch. : The editor follows the screenplay as the guide for establishing the structure of the story, and assembles the various shots and takes for greater, clearer artistic effect. There are several editing stages. In the first stage, the editor is supervised by the director, who conveys their vision to the editor. So this first rough cut is created during offline editing. After the first stage, the following cuts may be supervised by one or more television producers, who represent the production company and its investors. Consequently, the final cut is the one that most closely represents what the studio wants from the film, and not necessarily what the director wants during online editing. =Foley artist= : The Foley artist on a film crew creates and records many of the sound effects. Foley artists, editors, and supervisors are highly specialized and essential for producing a professional-sounding soundtrack – often reproducing commonplace yet essential sounds like footsteps or the rustle of clothing. The Foley artist also fabricates sounds that weren't correctly recorded while filming, much like the Sound editor does with digital sound effects. =Post-production runner= : A post-production runner, unlike a production runner, carries out tasks essential to the smooth running of a post-production house. Runners are the most junior members of a post- production team. =Publicist= : A publicist, or advertiser has the task of raising public awareness of a production, and ultimately increase viewers and sales of it and its merchandise. The publicist's main task is to stimulate demand for a product through advertising and promotion. Advertisers use several recognizable techniques in order to better convince the public to buy a product. These may include: *Repetition: Some advertisers concentrate on making sure their product is widely recognized. To that end, they simply attempt to make the name remembered through repetition. *Bandwagon: By implying that the product is widely viewed, advertisers hope to convince potential buyers to \\"get on the bandwagon.\\" *Testimonials: Advertisers often attempt to promote the superior worth of their product through the testimony of ordinary users, experts, or both. For example, using film critics or media personalities. This approach often involves an appeal to authority such as a doctor of media science. *Pressure: By attempting to make people choose quickly and without long consideration, some advertisers hope to make rapid sales, and a sense of urgency to watch or buy a product. *Association: Advertisers often attempt to associate their product with desirable things, in order to make it seem equally desirable. The use of attractive models, picturesque landscapes, and other similar imagery is common. \\"Buzzwords\\" with desired associations are also used. *Imagery: Using advertising slogans, logos, or a common image increases familiarity, trust, personality of a production, and the ability for the show to be remembered. The publicist ensures the media are well aware of a project by distributing the show as a trial run or sneak preview. They issue press releases and arrange interviews with cast and crew members. They may arrange public visits to the set, or distribute media kits that contain pictures, posters, clips, shorts, trailers, and descriptions of the show. =Sound editor= : In television, the sound editor deals with audio editing, adjusting and fixing of the soundtrack. They usually have a major decision-making and creative role when it comes to sound and audio. A sound editor also decides what sound effects to use and what effects to achieve from the sound effects, edits and makes new sounds using filters and combining sounds, shaping sound with volume curves, and equalizing. A sound editor places the Foley artist's sounds into the sound track. Often, a sound editor uses a sound effects library, either self- compiled, bought or both. =Title sequence designer= : A title sequence, in a television program, appears at the beginning of the show and displays the show name and credits, usually including actors, producers and, directors. A montage of selected images and a theme song are often included to suggest the essential tone of the series. A title sequence is essential in preparing the audience for the following program, and gives them a sense of familiarity that makes them trust, and feel comfortable with the film. It is up to the title sequence designer to achieve this very goal, and make it catchy, entertaining. Specialist editors =ADR editor= : Automatic dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process of replacing dialogue that was recorded incorrectly during filming, with the actors' voices recorded and put into place during editing. The ADR editor oversees the procedure and takes the corrupted dialogue, and replaces it with newly recorded lines to match the actor's mouth on film to make it lip sync correctly. =Bluescreen director/matte artist= : Bluescreen is the film technique of shooting foreground action against a blue background, which is then replaced by a separately shot background plate scene by either optical effects or digital composting. This process is directed and co-ordinated by the bluescreen director. The matte artist is a part of the special effects department who assists in making scenery and locations that do not exist. They assemble backgrounds using traditional techniques or computers that mix with the footage filmed to create a false set. Both are fairly alike, but bluescreen technology is more modern and more widely used. =Visual effects artist = : visual effects artist (VFX) are used in television productions to create effects that cannot be achieved by normal means, such as depicting travel to other star systems. They are also used when creating the effect by normal means is prohibitively expensive, such as an enormous explosion. They are also used to enhance previously filmed elements, by adding, removing or enhancing objects within the scene. The visual effects artist creates these effects, and develops them with the help of the visual effects supervisor. The task of the Visual effects artist differs frequently, and can range from combining extensive over-the-top special effects with computer visual effects and CGI animation.

In the , Jindalee had a population of 5,320 people. Geography Jindalee is by road south-west of the Brisbane CBD, and is a part of the Centenary suburbs. It is bordered by the Brisbane River to the north. The Centenary Motorway enters the suburb from the north (Kenmore), crossing the river on the Centenary Bridge (), and forms the south-eastern boundary of the suburb before exiting on the south-east corner of the suburb into Mount Ommaney / Sinnamon Park. The older part of the suburb is to the west of the motorway and is predominantly residential in character with individual houses. The Jindalee Golf Course is immediately west of the motorway (). To the east of the motorway are two large retail centres, separated by Sinnamon Road (). Also to the east of the motorway is a more recent townhouse estate between the retail precinct and the river (). The north-western boundary with the river has a riverside park with boat ramp () provided by the Brisbane City Council. History Wolston Estate was the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. In 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division, which contained the area of Wolston Estate. A small portion of Jindalee comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of fifty-four farms on an area of three thousand acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction. In 1903 the Sherwood Division became the Shire of Sherwood . In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. The Aboriginal meaning for Jindalee is \\"bare hills\\". Jindalee was the first of a series of suburbs originally called the \\"Centenary\\" suburbs, as planning for them commenced in 1959, the year of Queensland's centenary. Prior to development, the area had been largely used for grazing and dairy farming; however, it was developed as part of the Hooker Centenary Project, beginning in 1960.“Town To Be Built”, The Sydney Morning Herald, 11 November 1961. Retrieved 25 November 2017. The 8th Australian Scout Jamboree was held in the southwestern corner of Jindalee, which was subdivided and became Jamboree Heights, a suburb in its own right. Jindalee State School opened on 24 January 1966. The 1974 floods caused extensive damage to Jindalee, including inundation of many houses, as well as severe damage to the Centenary Bridge. A gravel barge rammed into the upstream side, blocking the floodwaters and raising real fears that the bridge would collapse. The barge was partly sunk using explosives to reduce pressure on the bridge. When the floodwater receded, the barge was refloated and beached downstream to be cut up for scrap. The damage sustained by the bridge required its partial closure for repairs. For two years after the floods, the bridge was reduced to a single lane. The bridge was duplicated in 1980, providing two lanes each way. Brisbane River in flood at Jindalee at the Centenary Bridge, 2011 In 1987 Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School in Darra opened a pre-school in Jindalee, renaming the school Darra-Jindalee Catholic School. In 2003 the facility in Jindalee closed and on 14 July 2008 the school returned to the name of the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School operating only at Darra. Centenary State High School opened in January 1999. The 2011 floods badly affected the suburb. In the , Jindalee had a population of 5,320 people. Education Jindalee State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 114 Burrendah Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 820 students with 65 teachers (54 full-time equivalent) and 36 non-teaching staff (22 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Centenary State High School is a government secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls at 1 Moolanda Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 1,484 students with 119 teachers (113 full-time equivalent) and 48 non-teaching staff (35 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Transport Jindalee is accessible via the Centenary Highway.

Sidis founded the New York State Psychopathic Institute and the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. He was the father of child prodigy William James Sidis. Boris Sidis eventually opposed mainstream psychology and Sigmund Freud, and thereby died ostracized. He was married to a maternal aunt of Clifton Fadiman, the American intellectual. Life and work Born in the Russian Empire to Jewish parents, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1887 to escape political persecution. Due to the May Laws, he was imprisoned for at least two years, according to William James Sidis' biographer, Amy Wallace. He later credited his ability to think to this long solitary confinement.Wallace, Amy (1986). The prodigy: a biography of William James Sidis, America's greatest child prodigy. New York: E.P. Dutton & Co. . His wife, Sarah Mandelbaum Sidis, M.D., and her family fled the pogroms about 1889. Boris completed four degrees at Harvard (a B.A., M.A., Ph.D. and M.D.) and studied under William James. He was influential in the early 20th century, known for pioneering work in psychopathology (founding the New York State Psychopathic Institute and the Journal of Abnormal Psychology), hypnoid/hypnotic states, and group psychology. He is also noted for vigorously applying the principles of evolutionary biology to the study of psychology. He vehemently opposed World War I, viewing war as a social disease, and denigrated the widely held concept of eugenics. He sought to provide insight into why people behave as they do, particularly in cases of a mob frenzy or religious mania. With the publication of his book Nervous Ills: Their Cause and Cure in 1922, he summarized much of his previous work in diagnosing, understanding and treating nervous disorders. He saw fear as an underlying cause of much human mental suffering and problematic behavior. Sidis applied his own psychological approaches to raising his son, William James Sidis, in whom he wished to promote a high intellectual capacity. His son has been considered among the most intelligent people ever (with a ratio IQ broadly estimated at 250–300, though this claim has been contested).

Trichogramma is one of around 80 genera from the family Trichogrammatidae, with over 200 species worldwide.Consoli FL, Parra JRP, Zucchi RA (2010) 'Egg Parasitoids in Agroecosystems with Emphasis on Trichogramma.' (Springer).Knutson A (2005) 'The Trichogramma Manual: A guide to the use of Trichogramma for Biological Control with Special Reference to Augmentative Releases for Control of Bollworm and Budworm in Cotton.' (Texas Agricultural Extension Service). Although several groups of egg parasitoids are commonly employed for biological control throughout the world, Trichogramma spp. have been the most extensively studied.Upadhyay RK, Mukerji KG, Chamola BP (2001) 'Biocontrol potential and its Exploitation in Sustainable Agriculture: Insect Pests.' (Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers). More than a thousand papers have been published on Trichogramma species, and they are the most used biological control agents in the world.Knutson A (2005) 'The Trichogramma Manual: A guide to the use of Trichogramma for Biological Control with Special Reference to Augmentative Releases for Control of bollworm and Budworm in Cotton.' (Texas Agricultural Extension Service). Trichogramma spp. have fewer than 10,000 neurons, approaching the size limit of how small an insect can be, determined by how few neurons they can fit in their central nervous systems, yet exhibiting a complex behavior to sustain their lives.  Parasitism  To locate host eggs, adult females use chemical and visual signals, such as egg shape and colour. After she finds a suitable egg, an experienced female attempts to determine if the egg has previously been parasitized, using her ovipositor and antennal drumming (tapping on the egg surface). Females also use antennal drumming to determine the size and quality of the target egg, which determines the number of eggs the female will insert. A single female can parasitize up to 10 host eggs a day.  Identification  Trichogramma wasps are small and very uniform in structure, which causes difficulty in identifying the separate species. As females are all relatively similar, taxonomists rely upon examination of males to tell the different species apart, using features of their antennae and genitalia. The first description of a Trichogramma species was in North America in 1871, by Charles V. Riley. He described the tiny wasps that emerged from eggs of the viceroy butterfly as Trichogramma minutum. In taxonomy, original specimens are very important, as they are the basis of reference for subsequent descriptions of species. The original specimens, however, were lost. Riley also described a second species in 1879 as Trichogramma pretiosum, but these specimens were also lost. To correct these errors, entomologists returned to the areas where Riley originally found the species and obtained neotype specimens of T. minutum and T. pretiosum. These specimens are now preserved properly in the United States National Museum. Currently, the number of Trichogramma species is over 200, but as of 1960, only some 40 species of Trichogramma had been described. Wolbachia in Trichogramma Wolbachia is a widespread bacterial genus that infects insects' organs, most commonly the reproductive organs. Wolbachia has been observed to alter the host’s reproductive success upon infection. Through a series of manipulations, Wolbachia-infected hosts transmit this intracellular bacterium to uninfected individuals. These manipulations include male killing (increasing ratio of infected females that can reproduce), feminization (males become fertile females), parthenogenesis, and cytoplasmic incompatibility. Horizontal transfer of parthenogenesis- inducing Wolbachia, which has been observed in Trichogramma wasps, causes infected females to asexually produce fertile females and nonfunctional males. The effects of this include potential speciation of Trichogramma, if Wolbachia is maintained long enough for genetic divergence to occur and for a new species of asexual wasps to become reproductively isolated. Transmission of the bacterium through horizontal transfer has been observed within the same species and among different species of Trichogramma, including T. kaykai, T. deion, T. pretiosum, and T. atopovirilia; however, limitations to transmission exist. In vitro successful horizontal transfer is uncommon within Trichogramma, which suggests that the density of Wolbachia must be relatively high inside of the hosts' ovaries. Cytoplasmic incompatibility of the host and bacterium can also be the source of this unsuccessful transfer in-vitro. These limitations in vitro suggest that in nature, horizontal transfer by parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia may be a difficult and rare phenomenon. However, when looking at the Wolbachia-host associations, the Trichogramma- Wolbachia form a monophyletic group based on several Wolbachia-specific genes, which may be explained by horizontal transfer of Wolbachia between different species. Therefore, although interspecific horizontal transfer of Wolbachia is limited in vitro, it is likely to occur quite frequently in nature and is not well understood yet. The effects of Wolbachia in Trichogramma have several evolutionary implications. Commonly, uninfected wasps are unable to breed with infected wasps. Many generations of reproductive isolation of these different groups may result in speciation. In addition, some hosts can evolve with a dependency on Wolbachia for core reproductive functions, such as oogenesis, so that eventually an infection is a requirement for successful reproduction. Finally, Wolbachia can influence gender determination in its hosts so that more females are successfully born. This results in a reversal in sexual selection, where females must compete for male mates, which has evolutionary implications as it exposes different phenotypes to natural selection.  Biological control  Trichogramma spp. have been used for control of lepidopteran pests for many years. They can be considered the Drosophila of the parasitoid world, as they have been used for inundative releases and much understanding today comes from experiments with these wasps.Smith SM (1996) Biological control with Trichogramma: advances, successes, and potential of their use. In 'Annual Review of Entomology' pp. 375-406.BURGIO G., MAINI S., 1995.- Control of European corn borer in sweet corn by Trichogramma brassicae Bezd. (Hym., Trichogrammatidae).- Journal of Applied Entomology, 119 (1): 83-87. Entomologists in the early 1900s began to rear Trichogramma spp. for biological control. T. minutum is one of the most commonly found species in Europe and was first mass reared in 1926 on eggs of Sitotroga cerealella. T. minutum has been investigated as a method of biological control of the Choristoneura fumiferana, a major pest of spruce and fir forests.Smith, S.M.; Hubbes, M.; Carrow, J.R. 1986. Factors affecting inundative releases of Trichogramma minutum Ril. against the spruce budworm. J. Appl. Entomol. 101(1):29–39. Nine species of Trichogramma are produced commercially in insectaries around the world, with 30 countries releasing them. Trichogramma wasps are used for control on numerous crops and plants; these include cotton, sugarcane, vegetables, sugarbeets, orchards, and forests. Some of the pests controlled include cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), codling moth (Cydia pomonella), lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), and European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). Trichogramma species vary in their host specificity. This can lead to nontarget hosts being parasitized. This, in turn, can cause problems by reducing the amount of parasitism of the target host, and depending on the rate of parasitism, nontarget effects could be significant on nontarget host populations. Research is being done on the use of Trichogramma wasps to control populations of spruce bud moth (Zeiraphera canadensis), which damages white spruce trees.Turgeon, Jean J. \\"Status of research on the development of management tactics and strategies for the spruce bud moth in white spruce plantations\\". The Forestry Chronicle. 68 (5): 614–622. doi:10.5558/tfc68614-5. = Species used = The most commonly used species for biological control are T. atopovirilia, T. brevicapillum, T. deion, T. exiguum, T. fuentesi, T. minutum, T. nubilale, T. platneri, T. pretiosum, and T. thalense. T. pretiosum T. pretiosum is the most widely distributed species in North America. It is a more generalized parasitoid, able to parasitise a range of different species. It has been the focus of many research studies and has been successfully reared on 18 genera of Lepidoptera. T. pretiosum was introduced into Australia in the 1970s as part of the Ord River Irrigation Area IPM scheme. T. carverae Trichogramma carverae is mainly used for light brown apple moth and codling moth control, and is predominately used in orchards.Llewellyn R (2002) The good bug book: beneficial organisms commercially available in Australia and New Zealand for biological pest control.' (Integrated Pest Management Pty Ltd). In Australia, T. carverae is used for biological control of light brown apple moth in vineyards. Though Australia has its own native Trichogramma species, not much work has been undertaken to use them commercially for biological control within Australia. Light brown apple moth is common throughout Australia and is polyphagous on more than 80 native and introduced species. The larvae cause the most damage, especially to grape berries, as their feeding provides sites for bunch rot to occur. Losses in the crops can amount up to $2000/ha in one season. It is very predominant in areas such as the Yarra Valley. Insecticide use is not a choice method for most growers, who prefer a more natural means of controlling pests. As a result, Trichogramma wasps were considered a good candidate for biological control, even more so as the moth larvae are difficult to control with insecticide. Moreover, light brown apple moths are relatively vulnerable to egg parasitism, with their eggs being laid in masses of 20-50 on the upper surfaces of basal leaves in grapevines.

Geography Barne Barton is located to the North West of Plymouth about 2 miles by road, or 1 mile as the crow flies, from the Tamar Bridge. From the southern side of the hill, there are panoramic views of the River Tamar and Cornwall. History Barne Barton in the sixteenth century was a farm (the words 'Barne Barton' actually mean 'Barne Farm') and produced essentials such as meat, wheat, grain and potatoes. The area includes Bull Point Barracks which were built in the 1840s and 1850s to accommodate military personnel guarding the Bull Point Ordnance Depot. Emmeline Pankhurst, the suffragette, was arrested and taken to Bull Point Barracks in 1913. In the 1960s Barne Barton became one of the largest naval estates within England providing accommodation for those serving in HMNB Devonport, Plymouth and on those warships stationed there. As the might of the Royal Navy reduced, so did the number of sailors. This reduction in manpower subsequently necessitated a reduction in the number of military married quarters required for serving personnel. As the size of the Navy continued to shrink, the first part of the military estate was sold by the MOD at a discounted purchase scheme to serving members of HM Forces with Naval Personnel given first priority and they ended up in private ownership. After further reduction in the size of the Royal Navy more properties were passed over initially to Plymouth City Council and then to Devon and Cornwall Housing Association. The MOD retained a number of houses which were refurbished by Annington Homes and were sold off to the general public. In July 2018 Clarion Housing Group submitted a planning application to redevelop the area with 200 new homes. The demolition of parts of the estate began on 11 June 2020, with the aforementioned new homes replacing them.

At this time, Sharpville was putting together European backing bands for visiting American blues artists (such as Hubert Sumlin, Ike Turner, Chuck Berry and Byther Smith). He won the British Blues Connection \\"Best UK Guitarist\\" award in 1995 (beating fellow nominees Eric Clapton and Gary Moore according to the April 1995 edition of British Blues Connection's Blueprint magazine) and became a mainstay on the European blues circuit as a solo artist. His second blues album, The Meaning of Life was released in 2001 on Cathouse Records and featured guests Leo Sayer, Eugene \\"Hideaway\\" Bridges, Snowy White, Paul Lamb, Keith Dunn, and ex-Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. In support of this release, Sayer toured extensively, as part of the Todd Sharpville Band. Taylor appeared as a special guest at a limited number of European dates. Sharpville can also be found on more than 35 compilation albums, and at least five Dana Gillespie releases. He participated in Mick Ronson's Memorial Concert (Citadel Records – recorded at the Hammersmith Apollo in 1994), in Albert Hammond's 2006 release Revolution of the Heart (Sharpville was Hammond's guitarist and musical director) and in Leo Sayer's Voice in My Head (2005).

Between 2005 and 2007, Sharpville was the European opening act for Pink, Joe Cocker, and B.B. King. He is still due to release his singer/songwriter album, Diary of a Drowning Man. This is a \\"confessional\\" album, inspired by his divorce. It features a duet with British vocalist Sam Brown (\\"Sweet Redemption\\"), and was co-produced by ex-Stone Roses record producer Dave Hyatt and Robbie Williams producer Steve Power. His new blues double album, Porchlight, was released on 29 October 2010 by the MiG Music record label. This was produced in Rhode Island by Duke Robillard and features contributions by Robillard, Joe Louis Walker and Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Sharpville assembled the world's first professional lockdown backing band which includes well known session musicians, living together under one roof in a rented Norfolk mansion. They perform online streaming shows each week, and have been remotely recording with a variety of artists. The James Bond film composer David Arnold has been working with Sharpville on material forming part of his public awareness campaign, designed to promote unity amongst the general public.

They are traditionally made up of leather and with extensive embroidery, in real gold and silver thread as inspired by Indian royalty over 400 years ago. Prior to that, Rajputs of the northwest used to wear leather juttis. Now with changing times different juti with rubber soles are made available. Besides Punjabi jutti, there are various local styles as well. Today Amritsar and Patiala (\\"tilla jutti\\") are important trade centers for handcrafted juttis, from where they are exported all over the world to Punjabi diaspora. Closely related to mojaris. Juttis have evolved into several localized design variations, even depending upon the shoemaker. However by large, they have no left or right distinction, and over time take the shape of the foot. They usually have flat sole, and are similar in design for both women and men, except for men they have a sharp extended tip, nokh curved upwards like traditional mustaches, and are also called khussa, and some women’s juttis have no back part, near the ankle. Even with changing times juttis have remained part of ceremonial attire, especially at weddings, the unembellished juttis are used for everyday use for both men and women in most of Punjab mostly called Jalsa Jutti which is blackish in color. Many Punjabi folk songs mention juttis, like Jutti kasuri peri na poori hai rabba sanu turna paiy and Jutti lagdi vairia mere'. Overview Punjabi jutti for men with extended curved tip, or nokh. There is a wide variety of juttis (pronounced 'jeut-tii' in Punjabi or 'jeu-tea' in Hindi/Urdu) available for both men and women. During certain festivals special juttis are also fitted to the feet of cows. Elsewhere in India, juttis are commonly also known as Mojari, while an alternative name in Pakistan is khussa. They are now very popular in the West too. Like mojaris, these are long shoes with the end curled upwards.They have been traditionally handed down over generations, with each generation contributing some variation to it. These are the traditional ethnic Indian footwear. They are usually made of fine leather and are delicately embroidered with threads or beads. Juttis are slip-on in style and are characterized by rising high to the Achilles' tendon in the back and covering the toes with a round or M-shaped heavily-embroidered upper, leaving the top of the foot nearly bare. Some feature extensive hand-done embroidery. It is believed that one of the earliest examples of footwear worn on the Indian subcontinent is a sandal of wood, datable to circa 200 BC. During the 3rd and 4th centuries in the Buddhist period, it was quite common to wear strapped sandals and Indian kings wore sandals ornamented with precious jewels. Jain literature shows that leather was used for the making of shoes, which protected the toes from getting injured. Hides of cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep and other wild animals were used.Feet and Footwear in Indian Culture, Jutta Hindu-Neubauer, Bata Shoe Museum Foundation, Toronto, Canada, in association with Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd., p.171. These ethnic shoes were worn by wealthy zamindars, chaudhary, nawab, jagirdars Maharajas and Maharanis of India (especially Punjab), various designs showcased in this category are inspired from the Mughal era. All these are handmade by skilled artisans in remote corners of India. Jutti is the traditional Indian footwear popular in North India, especially in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. It also has slightly different variations which are known as kussa or mojri. Beauty, vibrant color and utility are combined in these juttis of India. Rich golden threads and colorful beads are used to craft exquisite motifs in order to impart a royal touch on these juttis made of different shades of leather. People prefer wearing them on traditional occasions like weddings. Along with traditional dresses like sherwani or kurta pajama, juttis form the quintessential accessory.

It is situated to the north of Hexham,Acomb, Northumberland Local History not far from the junction of the A69 road and A6079 road. The name is Anglo-Saxon Old English acum, 'at the oak trees'. The traditional pronunciation of the name is \\"Yeckam\\". History Some Bronze Age cists have been discovered in this vicinity. Hadrian's Wall runs about 1 mile (1.5 km) to the NE of Acomb, where the site of Chesters Roman fort is located.  Governance  Acomb is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.  Economy  In this area there was much mining and quarrying. The coal mine at Acomb in 1886 employed 200 workers and 51,000 tons of coal per annum were raised. It was good coking coal and 41 coke ovens were in use. At Fallowfield then still working was another lead mine, where the Romans had mined and quarried. In 1886 the mine employed 120 men, mining lead and barites.  Religious sites  The pleasing church of St John Lee on the hillside amid the trees is dedicated to St John of Beverley, a local hermit and supposedly worker of miracles. There was a medieval church, but it was rebuilt in 1818 by Dobson and in 1885 enlarged by Hicks, so that it has a tower with spire -- a landmark that can be seen from Warden, Hexham and all around. In 1765 at St John Lee Church a most remarkable marriage was celebrated. The bridegroom was Robert Scott, a well-known Northumbrian piper. He was 90 years old and for 26 years he had moved about on crutches. His bride, Jean Middlemas, was only 25 years old and might be regarded as destined to be a nurse to an antique husband. But on his wedding day, he threw his crutches away and walked from the village of Wall, where he lived, to the church. He walked back again among a group of fellow pipers. At the conclusion of the marriage, they were regaled with cakes and ale. Was this a miracle by St John of Beverley?

The film is a sequel to 1987's Prison on Fire. Plot Like the first film, this follows the fraternal bond of two inmates, once again Ching, but this time with \\"Brother Dragon\\", a boss of the \\"Black Rats\\" gang. Ching escapes the prison in order to see his son, Leung was placed in an orphanage after his grandmother died, and gets into trouble with \\"Scarface's replacement, Officer Zau. Ching escapes a second time to follow Boss Dragon after he lied about jumping off a cliff to escape. Ching looked for his son and intended to bring him along, but was refused by the social worker. He was later apprehended by the police and was brought back to prison. On the way, Officer Zau tortures Ching. Ching gets thrown into the prison cell of the Mainland group and is beaten up by them as they thought he was the one who betrayed Brother Dragon. Skull takes a toothbrush, with a sharpened back and stabs Ching. Ching then convinces Brother Fireball and the other cellmates to set a fire in the prison cell, so as to escape from prison. After the fire breaks out, all the prisoners assembles outside, but Ching yells for help and runs towards to the Hongkie group for help. A fight then occurs between the Hongkie group and the Mainlanders, resulting in the arrival of more police personnel, who use water jet sprayers to control the situation, while Skull goes into hiding inside the canteen. Ching follows Skull and a violent fight starts. Officer Zau and his officers witness the fight and instead of breaking it up, Zau gives the order to lock them up, watching them fighting behind the gate. Skull begs Officer Zau to open the gate but Zau refuses. Skull self reproaches on his mistakes to Ching, and when Ching turns his back, Skull tries to stab Ching with the toothbrush again. Ching eventually knocks Skull down by dragging him over the table. Officer Zau then opens up the gate, and tries to use his baton to hit Ching, but was stopped by a good officer. Unfortunately, the good officer gets knocked down by Zau's barbaric act. Ching picks up the toothbrush and hides it while Officer Zau approaches him. Zau hits Ching's left arm and Ching uses the toothbrush, and stabs it into Officer Zau's left eye. Officer Zau screams in pain and engages in delirium. Officer Zau collapses on the floor and Ching faints. Ching awakes in a hospital and takes up his son's report card and reads it. His cellmate commented that his son's \\"handwriting was not bad\\", also a message for his dad: \\"Dad, don't be naughty in prison, Don't let me worry about you, remember...\\" this sentence is meaningful, \\"Tolerate, Tolerate, Tolerate....\\" Ching was discharged from the hospital and was being brought back to his cell, an officer told him that he was lucky that he had an officer to stand witness for him about the fight, that officer also gained a higher position thanks to him, signaling an end to the chaos. A new superintendent visits the cell and it is a coincidence that they met together back at the orphanage when he escaped the prison for the first time. Ching requests the superintendent, when he visits the orphanage, to look out for his son. Before the ending credits roll, an officer says \\"Long time no see\\" to Ching, and it's Officer \\"Scarface\\" from the previous film, Ching then self mutters ... about how unlucky he is. However the tone of the scene is built to be humorous implying Scarface no longer wields any similar threat, especially since the prisoners from the mainland were instructed not to hurt Ching, while he maintains an elder appreciation and respect from his Hongkonger cellmates.

History Unlike most settlements in the area, which date back several centuries, Šavnik is relatively new, founded only in 1861. It was populated by migrants from other parts of Montenegro and Herzegovina, mostly craftsmen, merchants, riflers and blacksmiths, which were needed by local farmers. The area was overgrown with willows, which the newly formed town was named after (šavice – willow branches or seams, which were used as a roof covering)., Analitika Before the construction of first houses on the site of today's town, there were two mills on Šavnik River. The first three houses that were built in Šavnik were a tavern with a shop, rifle repair shop and a blacksmith shop. The town quickly became a center for the Drobnjaci region, and incorporated a post office, school, primary court, and military post. Industrialization during the SFR Yugoslavia era mostly bypassed Šavnik, so did all major transit road or rail links, and economy of town went into stagnation. Population of Šavnik and entire municipality is since in slow but steady decline. Most of the residents are migrating to Nikšić and southern Montenegro, and Šavnik is often a synonym for a poor and deteriorating town. The new road Risan - Nikšić - Šavnik - Žabljak (P5), and proximity of Žabljak as a main mountain tourist resort in Montenegro may boost Šavnik's economic prospects.

Any modification or change to works agreed in the contract is treated as a variation. These modifications can be divided into three main categories # Addition to the work agreed in the contract. # Omission to work agreed in the contract. # Substitution or alteration to work agreed in the contract. A change order is work that is added to or deleted from the original scope of work of a contract, however, depending on the magnitude of the change, it may or may not alter the original contract amount and/or completion date. A change order may force a new project to handle significant changes to the current project.Project Management Process - Phase 3 - Implementing - Change Control Change orders are common to most projects, and very common with large projects. After the original scope (or contract) is formed, complete with the total price to be paid and the specific work to be completed, a client may decide that the original plans do not best represent his or her definition for the finished project. Accordingly, the client will suggest an alternate approach. Common causes for change orders to be created are: * The project's work was incorrectly estimated * The customer or project team discovers obstacles or possible efficiencies that require them to deviate from the original plan * The customer or project team are inefficient or incapable of completing their required deliverables within budget, and additional money, time, or resources must be added to the project * During the course of the project, additional features or options are perceived and requested. * If the contractor has to add work items to the original scope of work at a later time in order to achieve the customer's demands, a fair price for the work items and fees must be added for the materials and labor. A project manager then typically generates a change order that describes the new work to be done (or not done in some cases), and the price to be paid for this new work. Once this change order is submitted and approved it generally serves to alter the original contract such that the change order now becomes part of the contract.

Wolf and chief engineer Morris Pierce, who became station president.WDOK (AM) History, Cleveland Broadcast Radio Archives Project. Retrieved on 2007-01-01. Wolf himself was a longtime ethnic broadcaster on Cleveland stations WHK, WJAY, and WGAR, in addition to being the founder of Cleveland Recording Co. for the production of spot commercials, nationality music, and auditions. Early programming was highlighted by Wayne Mack's imaginary concert programs, such as \\"Hometown Band Concert\\", \\"Candlelight Concert\\", and \\"Waltz Palace.\\" WDOK's format was soon simulcast full-time on WDOK 102.1-FM. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, the station maintained a format of adult standards, although it did buck contemporary music trends by broadcasting two hours of classical music programming each night. By 1957, WDOK also was the radio home for 18 different nationality programs, most of them broadcast on Sundays. Wolf sold his stake in WDOK and WDOK-FM to Transcontinent Television Corp. of New York in 1962. Meanwhile, across town in the early 1960s, top-40 radio was flourishing led by KYW and WHK. In July 1964, three account executives at WHK - Norman Wain, Bob Weiss, and Joe Zingale - quit their jobs to form Westchester Corporation. They purchased WFAS in White Plains, New York (located in Westchester County, hence Westchester Corporation) in December 1964, and honed their skills in running a top-40 station.

The new call sign was similar to WXYZ in Detroit - and which also used the \\"Wixie\\" nickname - and also was selected for its rhyming with the 1260 frequency. The initial on-air lineup included Al Gates, Howie Lund, Johnny Michaels, Johnny Canton, Mark Allen, and Bobby Magic. Allen later moved on to Chicago's WCFL under the name Bob Dearborn. The news staff included Bob Engel, Fred Griffith, and Gary Ritchie. WIXY soon began to dominate top-40 radio in Cleveland, despite having a weaker signal than either WKYC (formerly KYW) or WHK. In 1966, WIXY sponsored The Beatles' second concert in Cleveland on August 14. (WHK had sponsored the first concert in 1964.) DJs who are remembered for their stint at WIXY during the late 1960s and early 1970s include Mike Reineri, Dick \\"Wilde Childe\\" Kemp, Larry \\"the Duker\\" Morrow (who settled in Cleveland after a stint as \\"Duke Windsor\\" on CKLW), Billy Bass, Lou \\"The King\\" Kirby, Bob Shannon, Chuck Dunaway, and Jackson Armstrong (Big Jack Armstrong \\"Your Leader\\"). WDOK-FM was, however, left untouched and still programmed by Wayne Mack. When Westchester Corporation saw the growing and devoted listener base that their largely ignored FM station was developing, WDOK was branded \\"Stereo Cleveland - Beautiful Music for the land of the Western Reserve.\\" While the FM station soon passed over into separate ownership, Wayne Mack stayed at WDOK until 1980, and died in October 2000. In 1969, Westchester Corporation took the format to the Pittsburgh market, purchasing WMCK in suburban McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and changing the calls to WIXZ. The Pittsburgh-area station used the same graphics and jingles as the Cleveland station - it was called \\"WIXZ 1360\\" (pronounced \\"Wick-zee Thirteen Sixty\\") - but failed to impact Pittsburgh as it had Cleveland, putting only a dent in the dominance of top-40 leader KQV. One of the jocks at WIXZ, Jeff Christie, later went on to national fame under his real name, Rush Limbaugh. The top-40 format at WIXZ lasted in various forms until 1974, and the call letters remained in place until it became talk station WPTT in 1999. The local ownership of WIXY was gobbled up by larger communications corporations in the 1970s. Wain, Weiss, and Zingale merged Westchester Corporation into Globetrotter Communications for $14.3 million in December 1971. Combined Communications (later Gannett) purchased Globetrotter in May 1975. \\"WIXY 1260\\" exists today as an online tribute station based in the Cleveland area airing the original PAMS jingles and classic 1960s and '70s hits.http://www.wixy1260online.com =Talk, oldies, big band= With the emergence of FM radio, the era of AM top-40 radio drew to a close. On July 19, 1976, WIXY became WMGC (or \\"Magic\\"), and the format switched to \\"adult rock\\", an early iteration of what would become known as adult contemporary. The station adopted the slogan \\"Get Your Rock Soft\\", which raised some eyebrows when it appeared in ads and billboards around town. Although it never caught on with a large audience, WMGC was home to several of the area's top broadcasters, including General Manager Dick Conrad, Program Director Jeff Baxter, and DJs Dan Bradford and Lady J. Also on the air as the most popular of the WMGC personalities was Dave Sanderson. In reality, Sanderson was well- known local broadcaster David Mark, who had to assume the Sanderson name due to contractual obligations to WKSW-FM and WEWS-TV. The adult rock format lasted less than three years. On April 14, 1979, the station became WBBG and switched to talk radio, under the name \\"SuperTalk 1260\\". The original lineup included several veteran Cleveland radio personalities - Bill Gordon, Merle Pollis, Ted Alexander, Bill Randle, Ed Fisher, Bruce Drennan with Sportstalk, and Cynthia Smith with the overnight program NightFlight 1260.WBBG History, Cleveland Broadcast Radio Archives Project. Retrieved on 2007-01-01. WBBG's talk format never caught on, so the station turned to an oldies format briefly before finding success with a big band-based music format programmed by local radio veteran Jim Davis. The station enjoyed much success including \\"Billboard Station of the Year\\" (for its format) in 1983 with a nomination of \\"Program Director of the Year\\" going to Davis. During its glory years (July 1981-October 1987), on-air talent, in addition to Davis, included Al James, Tom Armstrong, Bill Randle, Carl Reese, Ronnie Barrett, Dick Conrad, John Webster, Ted Alexander, Joe Black, and Jack Reynolds. Ownership of WBBG and sister FM station WWWM passed from Embrescia Communications (led by Tom Embrescia) to Robinson Communications (led by local civic leader and jeweler Larry Robinson) on October 27, 1981. (WWWM's call sign changed to WMJI six months later.) Robinson, in turn, sold the stations to media giant Jacor Communications on September 19, 1984.WMJI-FM History, Cleveland Broadcast Radio Archives Project. Retrieved on 2007-01-01.

The AM call sign was changed to WMJI on November 24, 1987Call Sign History for WCCR, from FCC'S AM station database. Retrieved 2007-01-01. Note that it only goes back to WMJI (AM). to match the FM station's (which legally became WMJI-FM for the interim). The big band format - and program director Jim Davis - soon migrated over to crosstown station WRMR. =Later years= After a few months of FM simulcasting, Jacor sold the station to Gore- Overgaard Broadcasting (led by Harold W. Gore and Cordell J. Overgaard), a Christian organization brought a format of religious programming and gospel music. The call sign was changed to WRDZ on July 1, 1988. Under Gore-Overgaard ownership, the station received permission to double its daytime power from 5,000 to 10,000 watts, although the upgrade was not accomplished until Divine Mercy Communications, Ltd. purchased and installed the new transmitter provided for in the license change. In early 1995, the station was purchased by Divine Mercy Communications Ltd., and it brought the format of Catholic programming. Under new call letters WMIH (for Mary's Immaculate Heart), which were adopted on February 23, 1995, the station was purported to be the first commercial Catholic radio station in the country. The station inaugurated its new format on February 22 by broadcasting a noon mass live from St. John's Cathedral celebrated by Bishop Anthony Pilla.WMIH History, Cleveland Broadcast Radio Archives Project. Retrieved 2007-01-01. Regular programming centered on a live morning drive-time program called Genesis, hosted by Fr. Wally Hyclack and Cleveland broadcast veteran Bob Tayek, which featured NBC Radio news and local newsmaker interviews, and an evening drive program, named \\"Homeward Bound\\", with a local call-in format on current topics. Midday programming included a live, local, two-hour talk show called Ave Maria, a local information and spiritual support program called the Living Word with Cleveland nun Sr. Juanita Sheely, broadcasts of various Catholic speakers, in a program called Catholic Classroom, which included Bishop Fulton J. Sheen's programs from the 1950s. In addition, the station produced live daily mass from St. John's Cathedral and carried regular installments of the English versions of Vatican broadcasts. WMIH also produced live play-by-play coverage of Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland) football and basketball games, both home and away, as well as live remotes from Cleveland-area Catholic events, such as the Feast of the Assumption in Cleveland's Little Italy. The station also provided its own live, on-location coverage of Pope John Paul II's entire trip to New York and Baltimore in 1995, with coverage anchored by owner Steve Kurdziel and local reports from Cuyahoga County Commissioner Lee Weingart. =Radio Disney AM 1260= Despite the innovative programming produced by WMIH, and the devoted listenership from the Catholic community in Cleveland, Divine Mercy ended up having serious financial trouble in maintaining that original programming, which emphasized local hosts and remote coverage of sports and other events. At the same time, ABC Radio was looking for an outlet for its Radio Disney in the Cleveland market, and it purchased the station. It took over the station on May 1, 1998, and the call sign was changed to WWMK on December 4. On August 13, 2014, Disney put WWMK and 22 other Radio Disney stations up for sale, to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. =AM 1260 The Rock= On December 24, 2014, the station was sold to St. Peter the Rock Media, a nonprofit company created by former Akron attorney Patrick D'Andrea and Cleveland attorney Gerald Monroe. They announced the station would become an EWTN Radio affiliate,EWTN affiliation - AM 1260 The Rock.com with a Catholic format under the branding AM 1260 The Rock - returning it to its prior format before the Radio Disney buyout. The new ownership group originally targeted April 2015 for the format switch,WWMK sold - Radio Insight.com but later was changed for May. On April 24, 2015, WWMK disaffiliated from Radio Disney, and went silent. St. Peter the Rock Media took over the station on May 4, upon consummation of the purchase from Radio Disney at a price of $895,000.AM 1260 The Rock history - AM 1260 The Rock.com On May 7, 2015, the station changed the call sign to WCCR and began its new format.Call Sign History - Federal Communications Commission References Further reading *Morrow, Larry (2010).

Similar rollers are used also at landfills or in agriculture. Road rollers are frequently referred to as steamrollers, regardless of their method of propulsion. History Horse- drawn road roller from 1800 Steam-powered roller Zettelmeyer diesel-powered road roller The first road rollers were horse-drawn, and were probably borrowed farm implements (see Roller). Since the effectiveness of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse- drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs with low gearing to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls in much the same way as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as \\"chip chasers\\" which followed the hot tar and chip laying machines. Some road companies in the US used steamrollers through the 1950s. In the UK some remained in service until the early 1970s. As internal combustion engines improved during the 20th century, kerosene-, gasoline- (petrol), and diesel-powered rollers gradually replaced their steam-powered counterparts. The first internal-combustion powered road rollers were similar to the steam rollers they replaced. They used similar mechanisms to transmit power from the engine to the wheels, typically large, exposed spur gears. Some users disliked them in their infancy, as the engines of the era were typically difficult to start, particularly the kerosene- powered ones. Virtually all road rollers in use today use diesel power. Uses on a road Road rollers use the weight of the vehicle to compress the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways, a four-wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed, and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads, a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth. This is usually done in combination with a motor grader to obtain a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller is be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) is compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller, or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the correct moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (there is an exception if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (known as asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were once common and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now. The pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action is the final roller to seal the surface. Rollers are also used in landfill compaction. Such compactors typically have padfoot or \\"sheep's foot\\" drums, and do not achieve a smooth surface. The pads aid in compression, due to the smaller area contacting the ground. Configurations Flattened and leveled construction site with road roller in the background The roller can be a simple drum with a handle that is operated by one person and weighs or as large as a ride-on road roller weighing and costing more than US$150,000. A landfill unit may weigh . =Roller types= Pedestrian-operated * Rammer (bounce up and down) * Walk-behind plate compactor/light * Trench roller (manual unit or radio- frequency remote control) * Walk-behind roller/light (single drum) * Walk- behind roller/heavy (double drum) Ride-on smooth finish * Tandem drum (static) * Tandem drum (vibrating) * Single drum roller (smooth) * Pneumatic- tyred Roller, called rubber tyre or multi-wheel * Combination roller (single row of tyres and a steel drum) * Three point roller (steam rollers are usually three-point) Ride-on soil/landfill compactor with pads/feet/spikes * Single drum roller (soil) * 4-wheel (soil/landfill) * 3-point (soil/landfill) * Tandem drum (soil/landfill) Other * Tractor-mounted and tractor- powered (conversion – see gallery picture below) * Drawn rollers or towed rollers (once common, now rare) * Impact compactor (uses a square or polygon drum to strike the ground hard for proof rolling or deep lift compacting) * Drum roller with rubber coated drum for asphalt compaction * Log skidder converted to compactor for landfill * Wheel loader converted to compactor for landfill =Drum types= Drums are available in widths ranging from . =Tyre roller types= Tyre rollers are available in widths ranging up to , with between 7 and 11 wheels (e.g. 3 wheels at front, 4 at back): 7 and 8 wheel types are normally used in Europe and Africa; 9 and 11 in America; and any type in Asia. Very heavy tyre rollers are used to compact soil. =Variations and features= * On some machines, the drums may be filled with water on site to achieve the desired weight. When empty, the lighter machine is easier and cheaper to transport between work sites. On pneumatic tyre rollers the body may be ballasted with water or sand, or for extra compaction wet sand is used. Modern tyre rollers may be filled with steel ballast, which gives a more even balance for better compaction. * Additional compaction may be achieved by vibrating the roller drums, allowing a small, light machine to perform as well as a much heavier one. Vibration is typically produced by a free-spinning hydrostatic motor inside the drum to whose shaft an eccentric weight has been attached. Some rollers have a second weight that can be rotated relative to the main weight, to adjust the vibration amplitude and thus the compacting force. * Water lubrication may be provided to the drum surface from on-board \\"sprinkler tanks\\" to prevent hot asphalt sticking to the drum. * Hydraulic transmissions permit greater design flexibility. While early examples used direct mechanical drives, hydraulics reduce the number of moving parts exposed to contamination and allows the drum to be driven, providing extra traction on inclines. * Human-propelled rollers may only have a single roller drum. * Self-propelled rollers may have two drums, mounted one in front of the other (format known as \\"duplex\\"), or three rolls, or just one, with the back rollers replaced with treaded pneumatic tyres for increased traction.

It shares characteristics with traditionalist conservatism and social conservatism given how the three variations focus on preservation and tradition. As national conservatism seeks to preserve national interests, traditional conservatism emphasizes ancestral institutions. Additionally, social conservatism emphasizes a patriarchal, restrictive attitude regarding moral behavior to preserve one's traditional status in society. National-conservative parties often have roots in environments with a rural, traditionalist or peripheral basis, contrasting with the more urban support base of liberal-conservative parties. In Europe, most embrace some form of Euroscepticism.Traynor, Ian, The EU's weary travellers The Guardian, 4 April 2006 The majority of conservative parties in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 have been national conservative. Ideology =Social policies= National conservative parties are \\"socially traditional\\", and support the traditional family and social stability.Rosenberger, Sieglinde, Europe is swinging towards the right - What are the effects on women? , University of Vienna, 2002. Retrieved 6 December 2010. According to the Austrian political scientist Sieglinde Rosenberger, \\"national conservatism praises the family as a home and a center of identity, solidarity, and tradition\\". Many national conservatives are thus social conservatives, as well as in favor of limiting immigration and enacting strict law-and-order policies. =Economic policies= National conservative parties in different countries do not necessarily share a common position on economic policy: Their views may range from support of a planned economy to a centrist mixed economy to a laissez-faire approach. In the first, more common, case, national conservatives can be distinguished from liberal conservatives,National Questions, National Review, Vol. 49, Issue 12, 30 June 1997, pp. 16-17 for whom free market economic policies, deregulation, and tight spending are the main priorities.

(1984), he and his co-author James Medoff presented evidence that countered conventional wisdom in economics when they concluded that “unionism on net probably raises social efficiency” and that “recent trends have brought the level of union density below the optimal level.”Freeman, Richard B. and James Medoff (1984). What Do Unions Do, New York: Basic Books, pp. 247 and 250. Freeman’s work on the economic theory of unions has found support in several subsequent studies indicating that in many fields unionized workers have delivered higher levels of productivity than their non-union counterparts. Nevertheless, some comparative scholarship indicates that the union advantage in productivity may vary by nation. Christos Doucouliagos and Patrice Laroche in an article entitled “What do unions do to productivity?” (2003) indicate that unions significantly lift productivity in U.S. manufacturing, but these authors countered with evidence that unions have had detrimental effects on productivity in the United Kingdom. Freeman and his collaborators have explored how the tournament model of prizes and funding in the biosciences has favored older researchers and contributed to the degradation of conditions for postdocs and graduate students. He has carried out a variety of studies on the internationalization of science, as more than half of the PhDs graduating in science and engineering from U.S. universities in 2003 were foreign born, more than double the rate in 1966.Freeman, Richard B. and Daniel L. Goroff (2009). “Introduction.” Science and Engineering Careers in the United States: An Analysis of Markets and Employment, Chicago: NBER and University of Chicago Press, p14. In his early career, Freeman often faced critique for his book The Overeducated American (1976), which suggested that the U.S. labor market would have vast challenges employing the millions of citizens with college diplomas and advanced degrees from the enormous expansion of higher education after World War II. The high-tech boom of the later 1980s and 1990s reassured most observers that expanding higher education was the trusted route to national economic vitality and achieving the dreams for prosperity sought by millions of individuals. However, Freeman’s thesis that labor markets will not always be friendly to university-educated workers is enjoying a revival in the early twenty-first century. This re-consideration has gained momentum since the high unemployment and underemployment of college graduates following the Great Recession of 2008 as well as trends in globalization that have led to the off shoring of many jobs done by lawyers, accountants, information technology workers, and other well-educated professionals. Freeman has made the case that expanding programs for employee ownership and broader-based profit sharing would help reduce inequality in the United States. He co-wrote with Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse of Rutgers The Citizen’s Share: Reducing Inequality in the Twenty-first Century (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), a work that French economist Thomas Piketty credited for tracing how “America used to be based on broad access to wealth and property” and then showing “how to revive” this tradition.Quote from cover of Freeman, Richard B., Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse,The Citizen’s Share: Reducing Inequality in the Twenty-first Century, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013. Freeman has also written with Kimberly Ann Elliott studies of how human rights vigilantes have generated activism and consumer consciousness about apparel and other consumer products often manufactured under sweatshop labor conditions.Elliott, Kimberly Ann, and Richard B.

Epstein is currently Professor of English and Director of the Creative Writing Program at Boston University. Career Epstein was born to an American Jewish family in Los Angeles and grew up in Hollywood. He later attended the Webb School of California. His father Philip and uncle Julius were both noted screenwriters. Together, they won an Academy Award for the celebrated 1942 film Casablanca. Epstein has written nine novels including King of the Jews (1979), about Chaim Rumkowski, head of the Judenrat of the Łódź ghetto during World War II; and Pandaemonium (1997). His San Remo Drive: A Novel from Memory (2004) was based on his childhood growing up in Hollywood in the 1940s and 50s. Epstein's most recent novels are The Eighth Wonder of the World, published by Other Press in 2006, and Liebestod: Opera Buffa with Lieb Goldkorn, published by W. W. Norton & Co. in February 2012. Epstein has written articles for Esquire, The Atlantic, Playboy, Harper's, The Yale Review, The Nation, The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post and The Boston Globe. Among those articles is his essay, \\"Returning to Proust's World Stirs Remembrance\\", for the New York Times series, 'Writers on Writing' (Vol. II). In it, he defined reading Marcel Proust \\"ala Epstein\\" as reading Proust each night before bedtime; by confining the session to two pages of five minutes, he created a five-year project to complete all the volumes of A la recherche du temps perdu. His rationale: \\"It is not a bad idea to keep a nightly appointment with a noble mind; it has the power to purify even the most wasted day.\\" For more than twenty years, Leslie Epstein has been the director of the Creative Writing Program at Boston University, where he joined the faculty in 1978. In February 2007, his play King of the Jews (not an adaptation of his earlier novel, but an independent realization of the same theme) was premiered at Boston Playwrights' Theatre to critical acclaim.

Early life and career  As a child, Cheung idolized kung-fu legend Bruce Lee but never seriously considered a career in acting. Starting out as a model, Cheung turned to acting when director Yeung Fan cast him in his 1986 film Lost Romance and the first of his many roles portraying a villain followed in the acclaimed director Ringo Lam's 1987 City on Fire. In 1996, Cheung appeared in the 3rd, 4th and 6th installments of the Young and Dangerous series. Roles that heralded the beginning of a long working relationship with director/cinematographer Andrew Lau.  Present day  Recently, Cheung has appeared in a number of Andrew Lau's films, most notably in the second installment of the internationally acclaimed Infernal Affairs trilogy, and in the 1998 The Storm Riders, in which Cheung broke free of his standard villainous self altogether and portrayed a Shaolin monk.
