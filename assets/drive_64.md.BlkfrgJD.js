It is located along the Nolichucky River and on State Routes 81 and 107.  History  Embreeville was once a mining community. Lead was first mined, reportedly used in bullets fired at the British in 1780 in the Battle of Kings Mountain. In 1812, William Chester, the owner of the Chester Inn located in nearby Jonesborough, bought near the mouth of Bumpus Cove and built a crude beehive iron forge built with native rocks. In July 1820, he sold his iron mine and iron works to brothers Elijah and Elihu Embree, whose family had a history in iron production (Elihu is remembered for establishing two abolitionist newsletters, The Manumission Intelligencer and The Emancipator, in Jonesborough).Paul Fink, Jonesborough: The First Century of Tennessee's First Town (Overmountain Press, 1989), pp. 139-141. After Elihu's death in 1820, Elijah partnered with the Blair brothers, Robert, John and William, to establish the Washington Iron Manufacturing Company (renamed the Embree Iron Company in 1831).Jeannette McLaughlin, \\"Embreeville and Bumpass Cove,\\" An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee (Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), pp. 180-182. After Elijah died in 1849, the Blairs became the owners of the company. During the 1850s, the Blairs' iron works was one of the largest iron production operations in East Tennessee. A Confederate businessman, Duff Green, took control of the iron works during the Civil War, but the Blairs regained control at the end of the war. In 1889, English investors formed the Embreeville Land, Iron and Railway Company. In 1891, a railroad, later acquired by Southern Railway Company, was completed from Johnson City to Embreeville. That same year the company formed the Embreeville Town Company to develop an industrial town of thirty thousand inhabitants. In 1892 the company completed a smelter with pig iron output of 150 tons per day. However, the operations stalled due to the Panic of 1893, and all efforts to develop commercial iron production proved futile. In 1900, American interests took over the British holdings. The Embree Iron Company acquired the property in 1903 but was equally unsuccessful in commercially producing pig iron. The company was able to stave off dissolution in 1913, however, when the presence of commercial zinc deposits was recognized. Embree Iron Company began producing zinc and then lead and quickly paid off its debts. Although ore reserves dwindled after World War I, the company continued to operate during the Great Depression. Manganese production began in 1935, and in 1939 the company was the nation's largest producer of metallurgical grade manganese concentrates, boasting an output of 73,000 tons. Manganese reserves were rapidly exhausted, however, and the company was liquidated in 1946. Since then, no mining operations have been done. Bumpass Cove waste site In June 1972, the Bumpass Cove Environmental Controls and Minerals Corporation obtained a permit from the Tennessee Department of Public Health, Division of Solid Waste Management, to operate a sanitary landfill located in an old mining site near the head of the cove. In November 1972, the Bumpass Cove Development Corporation [BCDC] discussed the feasibility and design of a proposed liquid waste incinerator to burn the hazardous and hard-to-treat liquid wastes. Tentative approval from the Division of Air Quality Control and Division of Solid Waste Management was given pending completion of a formal permitting process to operate a liquid waste incinerator. The incinerator, located in the old Fowler mining site, was operated in an improper manner. BCDC never completed application for the incinerator to become a permitted facility. Subsequently, it was closed by the Division of Air Quality Control. A few residents believed that unauthorized wastes were being deposited at both the main landfill and the Fowler site. In July 1979, a picket line was formed to stop trucks from hauling waste to the main landfill. Increased numbers of citizens became involved, and the Bumpass Cove Citizens Group was incorporated on November 26, 1979. The objectives of the group included removal of hazardous waste from the old mine sites, education, and awareness of community development. Skip Foss was the first president. Partly in response to citizen pressure, Waste Resources decided to close the landfill in December 1979.

Description This plant is a perennial herb with thick, ribbed, decumbent stems growing in clumps up to 30 centimeters tall. The herbage is woolly, gray, and fleshy.Brown, K. L. and K. A. Bettink. (2009 onwards). Arctotheca populifolia. Swan Weeds: Management Notes. FloraBase ‚Äî The Western Australian Flora. Department of Environment and Conservation. The white-haired leaves have oval blades up to 6 centimeters long by 5 wide, with smooth or toothed edges. The inflorescence is borne on a woolly, erect peduncle up to 11 centimeters tall. The flower head is about 2 centimeters wide with yellow ray florets 5 to 7 millimeters long and yellow disc florets in the center. The fruit is a white-woolly cypsela about half a centimeter long. Ecology This plant is a pioneer species of sandy coastal habitat types, such as dunes. It is a main factor in the formation of dune hummocks, a dune type formed in its native South Africa when wind deposits sand around it and other newly established beach plants. One small form of dune hummock is a nabkha. This plant and its associate Gazania rigens form nabkhas that are inhabited by a variety of small animals such as nematodes and the sand flea Talorchestia capensis. The ability of the plant to colonize bare sand has helped it take hold on the Australian coastline. It was planted for beach stabilization in Western Australia until it became apparent that it was invasive. Native Spinifex grasses are now used for this purpose. The beach daisy is now a coastal weed of much of temperate Australia. It can also grow on basaltic soils, allowing it to move inland from beaches to grasslands. The seeds of the plant are wind-dispersed, but because they remain viable in fresh and salt water, they are also commonly dispersed on the water. As a coastal species, they are carried on ocean currents.Volunteers battle beach daisies. Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources. Government of South Australia. June 29, 2012.Salleh, A. Message in a bottle helps fight weeds. ABC Science. February 15, 2008. The seeds can also be transported in soil and plant waste. As an invasive species, it competes with native plants such as hairy spinifex (Spinifex sericeus). It binds sand more efficiently, holding more of it and thus changing the topography of the dune systems. This process can interrupt the flow of seawater into and out of coastal lakes. Even seedlings one centimeter tall can accumulate sand, building tiny dunes of their own. Many shorebirds nest on bare sand beaches because they can more easily see predators, so the buildup of vegetation and hilly dunes interferes with their nesting. The flowers are pollinated by bees and flies. The plant is host to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Septoglomus fuscum. The seeds of the plant are a favored food item of the African hairy-footed gerbil (Gerbillurus paeba), which also eats T. capensis, the sand flea that lives in the dunes around the plant.

It deals with the topics of the French Revolution and the resulting social upheaval, destruction caused by war, the formation of the first French Republic, the ideals of justice and equality among classes, and friendship and devotion. The book was first published in French in 1863. It was translated into English and published under the title Madame Th√©r√®se or The volunteers of '92 by Charles Scribner and Company in 1889.  Plot  The book is told through the eyes of a young boy, Fritz, who lives with his uncle Jacob and housekeeper Lisa in a small village called Anstatt, near the present-day German towns of Kaiserlautern and Landau. After Fritz was orphaned he was adopted by his uncle, who is a doctor for the village and surrounding areas. One day in November 1793, the village awakens to find the French Republican army, who go house-to-house searching for food and supplies for their battalion. The army Colonel comes to doctor Jacob‚Äôs house, where his men start baking bread for their soldiers. It is here that little Fritz, doctor Jacob and their housekeeper first meet Th√©r√®se, who is a cantini√®re travelling with the French battalion along with her little twelve-year-old brother Jean. The Colonel and the Republican army personnel do not use formal titles such as ‚ÄòMadame‚Äô or ‚ÄòMonsieur‚Äô when speaking to each other; instead, they address each other mutually using only the salutation ‚Äòcitizen‚Äô. Later during the same day, a battle ensues in the village between the French Republicans and the defending armies of the Prussian and Austrian rulers. Fritz witnesses the bloody battle with his own eyes and sees firsthand the loss of lives and destruction of property that war brings. The Republican army is outnumbered and they realise they have to retreat. As the soldiers are departing, they quickly set up a barricade of stolen furniture and straw to block the street and then light it on fire, which soon spreads to nearby houses. Several other Austrian battalions pass through the village throughout the day and the accompanying army doctors and ambulances collect the wounded soldiers who are still alive. The village residents are left with putting out the fire and burying the soldiers who were killed. As the local undertaker and his men are carting away the dead bodies for burial, it is discovered that the cantini√®re Th√©r√®se, who was wounded and is lying unconscious among the dead, is still alive also. She is rescued by doctor Jacob, who takes her to his house and with the help of friends performs an operation that removes a bullet from her shoulder. After several days, Th√©r√®se regains consciousness. She continues to live and recuperate in doctor Jacob‚Äôs house along with her poodle dog Scipio, who becomes a good friend to Fritz. As time passes, Th√©r√®se becomes well- acquainted with and respected by the members of doctor Jacob‚Äôs household and his close friends. The relationship that develops between them, as well as the turn of events on the military front, eventually culminates in her marriage to doctor Jacob, the victory of the Republican army over the Prussian forces, and the joyful reunion of Th√©r√®se with her little brother Jean. The reader is left with the impression of a moral victory of the French Republican cause due to their ascribed ideals of social justice, fairness, and equality among classes as personified by the good-natured and kind Th√©r√®se.  Adaptations  The novel was adapted by Chatrian into a play in five acts and performed in the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet on October 9, 1882. It was also adapted into an illustrated series published in 25 parts by the newspaper Lib√©ration in 1949.  Quotes  For the first time, I fully understood what death is; these men that I had seen two minutes before, full of life and strength, charging their enemies with fury, and rushing forward like wolves, lay there, pell-mell, senseless as the stones of the street. (Chapter III) \\"Behold what war is, Fritz; -look, and remember! Yes, this is war; death and destruction, fury and hatred, disregard of all human feelings. ...here it is man himself, who decrees misery to his kind, spreads his ravages far and wide, without pity. Yesterday, we were at peace; we asked nothing of anybody; we had done no harm; -and suddenly strange men came to strike, to ruin and destroy us. ...Fritz, remember this; war is all that is most abominable on earth. Men who do not know, who have never seen each other, rush suddenly together, to tear each other to pieces. This alone would make us believe in God, for there must be an avenger of such iniquity.\\" (Chapter IV)  See also  Digitized version of the full-text English translation published in 1903.

It is the terminus of the South Line of the Sounder commuter rail network, operated by Sound Transit in the Seattle metropolitan area. The station, located along Pacific Highway Southwest, includes a 620-stall parking garage and several bus bays served by Intercity Transit and Sound Transit Express. Lakewood station was originally scheduled to open in 2002 as part of a Sounder extension, but plans were delayed due to funding issues and the state government's work on the Point Defiance Bypass project. Construction on the $33 million station and garage began in March 2007 and it opened for use by buses on September 18, 2008. Sounder service to Lakewood began in October 2012 and the pedestrian bridge opened a few months later. Description Lakewood station is located along Pacific Highway near its intersection with 47th Avenue Southwest, to the east of central Lakewood. The station consists of a single side platform along the double-tracked Point Defiance Bypass, and an adjacent bus station with six bays. A four-story parking garage with 620 parking spaces is north of the bus station and includes a pedestrian bridge over the tracks to Kendrick Street Southwest, near St. Clare Hospital. The garage also has 18 covered parking spaces for bicycles. The station was designed by Hewitt Architects and includes one piece of public art commissioned by Sound Transit, Transpire, a cast bronze sculpture by Mark Calderon that depicts a campfire with intertwined spires. The original design of the sculpture attracted controversy for being phallic in nature, which conflicted with the city's stance against prostitution and sex businesses that had historically operated along Pacific Highway. History Bus bays at Lakewood station, seen from the parking garage A commuter rail line serving Pierce County was first considered in the late 1980s by Metro Transit, but were limited to proposals that terminated in Tacoma. The regional transit plan published in 1993 initially excluded Lakewood, but a new regional transit authority (which would later become Sound Transit) added the city to its commuter rail studies in late 1993. The Lakewood‚ÄìSeattle commuter rail line was included in a 1995 ballot measure, along with a feasibility study for an extension to DuPont, but it was defeated by suburban voters. The transit plan returned on the November 1996 ballot and was passed by voters, allocating $9 million in funding to the Lakewood commuter rail station. The Lakewood segment of the commuter rail system was originally scheduled to open in 2002, shortly after the start of service from Tacoma to Seattle in 2000. Insufficient sales tax revenue, increased construction costs, design changes requested by Tacoma officials, and the state government's delays in planning the Point Defiance Bypass moved the projected opening date to 2007 and later 2012. Lakewood's city government selected a site on Pacific Highway Southwest near Bridgeport Way as its preferred location for the commuter rail station in 1998, and it was adopted by Sound Transit after the completion of an environmental assessment in 2002. Sound Transit's preferred design included a 1,000-stall surface park and ride lot, but Lakewood's concerns about pedestrian safety and impacts to potential development led to the addition of a parking garage, costing up to $7 million more. Construction of Lakewood station's bus bays and parking garage began on March 26, 2007, under the direction of contractor PCL Construction, who were awarded the $18.8 million construction contract in February. Major construction was completed in June 2008 and the $33 million station opened for use by bus passengers on September 21, 2008. The station was initially served by Sound Transit Express routes to Tacoma and Seattle, as well as local routes operated by Pierce Transit and Intercity Transit. Construction of the Lakewood segment, which included new street crossings and signals, began in March 2010 and reached substantial completion by December; work on the Tacoma segment, which included a new overpass over Pacific Avenue near Tacoma Dome Station, was completed in March 2012 and testing along the extension began in August. Sounder service to Lakewood began on October 8, 2012, marking the completion of the original network, and was preceded by a ribbon-cutting celebration and inaugural rides to and from Tacoma Dome Station two days prior. The pedestrian bridge to Kendrick Street was completed in July 2013. As part of the state's construction of the Point Defiance Bypass, a second track was built in 2016 through Lakewood station to allow Amtrak trains to bypass Sounder trains at the platform. In 2016, voters approved the Sound Transit 3 package, which included an extension of Sounder from Lakewood to Tillicum and DuPont that is scheduled to open in 2036. Services The Sounder South Line has 13 daily round-trips between Pierce County and Seattle, of which eight terminate at Lakewood station. Late morning, early afternoon, and reverse-peak trains do not serve Lakewood, with the exception of a mid-day train added in 2016. Sounder trains travel from Lakewood to Tacoma in 21 minutes and to Seattle in 76 minutes. Lakewood station is also served by Sound Transit Express routes connecting to Puyallup station, DuPont, Tacoma, and Seattle. Intercity Transit operates buses between Tacoma and Olympia that stop at the station.

The tale also holds similarities with widespread tales of the swan maiden (bird maiden or bird princess).Haase, Donald. The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F.

Cultural references Reference to the story is also made by Carl Sagan in his book Contact. The tale and the Tanabata festival are also the basis of the Sailor Moon side story entitled Chibiusa's Picture Diary-Beware the Tanabata!, where both Vega and Altair make an appearance. The Post-Hardcore band La Dispute named and partially based their first album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, after the tale. The JRPG Bravely Second: End Layer also uses the names Vega and Altair for a pair of story-important characters who shared a love interest in each other years before the game's story began, Deneb being their common friend. South Korean girl group Red Velvet's song \\"One of These Nights\\" from their 2016 EP, The Velvet, also references the legend of the two lovers. J-pop band Supercell also references the story on its song \\"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\\". The novel Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart is centered around the tale, but incorporates many more Chinese folk stories while retelling the tale. Similar to the Chang'e space program being named after the Chinese goddess of the moon, the Queqiao relay satellite of Chang'e 4 is named after the \\"bridge of magpies\\" from the Chinese tale of the cowherd and weaver girl. The Chang'e 4 landing site is known as Statio Tianhe, which refers to the heavenly river in the tale. The nearby far- side lunar craters Zhinyu and Hegu are named after Chinese constellations associated with the weaver girl and the cowherd.

From 1951 the IAA eventually became established in Frankfurt. A new bi-annual Motor Show, called Autos, Avus, Attraktionen (AAA), was established by the Messe Berlin company in 1978. The last show was held in 2000, with the 2002 show cancelled four months prior to the expected 2002 exhibition. History On 30 September 1897, the first IAA was held by the Mitteleurop√§ischer Motorwagenverein (\\"Central European Motor Vehicle Association\\") at the Hotel Bristol on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin. A total of eight Benz Velo, Lutzmann, K√ºhlstein, and Daimler motor vehicles were on display. A second motor show was held in 1898 at the exhibition grounds near Lehrter Bahnhof; in 1899 more than 100 exhibitors participated in the third motor show . As the automobile became more known and accepted, the IAA became a fixed event in Germany, with at least one held every year, usually in Berlin. In 1902 the show was held for the first time by the Association of German Automotive Industrialists (Verein Deutscher Motorfahrzeug-Industrieller) at Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station. The 7th exhibition in 1905 was inaugurated by Emperor Wilhelm II and until 1907, there were even two shows per year, as production had increased to an industrial level. In the next years, however, the show was suspended, due to the outbreak of World War I. Maybach stand, 1924 With a pause after the war, the IAA was then reinstated and returned to a newly built exhibition hall in Berlin Westend in 1921, with 67 German automobile manufacturers displaying 90 vehicles under the motto \\"comfort\\", including the Rumpler Tropfenwagen and a Bosch electric car horn. More than 600 exhibitors participated in the 15th IAA in 1923 and the next year's show saw the premiere of economy cars like the Hanomag 2/10 PS or the Opel 4 PS (Laubfrosch). The 1927 IAA was held at Cologne (under pressure from Mayor Konrad Adenauer), followed by the 20th IAA in Leipzig in March 1928, nevertheless, the 21st exhibition was again held in Berlin in November. It featured the first German vehicle with a rack steering and independent suspension (R√∂hr 8) as well as the eight-cylinder Opel Regent luxury car and a crank operated window by Brose. The 1929, 1930, and 1932 IAA were cancelled due to the Great Depression. Despite the still perceptible after-effects of the global recession, the 22nd IAA was held in Berlin in 1931 with a total of 295,000 visitors. For the first time the exhibition included front-wheel drive vehicles like the DKW F1. Hitler and G√∂ring at the Berlin Motor Show, February 1933 The 23rd IAA was held from 11 to 23 February 1933, a few days after the Nazi seizure of power. It was inaugurated by Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who announced tax benefits for car owners, a major road construction programme and state-funded motorsport events. New models introduced included the Ford K√∂ln, the Standard Superior, as well as the twelve-cylinder Maybach Zeppelin DS 8, then the most expensive German car ever built. In the following years, the annual exhibition developed to a national hall of fame of German engineering skill, essentially influenced by Nazi propaganda. Pushed by extensive billboard and screen advertising, the IAA finally became a mass event, with more than 600,000 visitors in 1934. In his inaugural speech, Hitler promised the construction of a cheap, simple car for the masses. He also proclaimed the idea of economic autarky, illustrated by the display of wood gas generators based on the patent of Georges Imbert or a steam car designed by Henschel. Nevertheless, the launch of the stream-lined Tatra 77 attracted greater attention. The manufacturing of the people's car (Volkswagen) remained the central issue of the following exhibitions. Finally in 1939, the KdF-car was presented for the first time, which later came to be known as the Beetle. The 29th installation of the event gatherered a total of 825,000 visitors - an all-time record at that time. This was the last IAA before it was again suspended during World War II. 2000 The 2000 show was the last Berlin Motor Show, with over 200,000 visitors. * Audi A4 Sedan * Opel Zafira 1.6 CNG 1998 In 1998, the AAA was held at the Berlin exposition area between October 17 and 25. 1996 * Audi A4 Avant Duo * Ford Ka \\"Step 1\\" Concept References Category:Auto shows in Germany Category:Events in Berlin ","title":"Berlin Motor Show"},{"id":"39753423","text":"Alexander von Schrenk (1816‚Äì1876) Alexander Gustav von Schrenk (4 February 1816 ‚Äì 25 June 1876) was a Russian naturalist born near Tula in what was then the Russian Empire.

This 5 Volume Commentary covers about 3,000 pages with an Introduction by Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, the Second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya movement. The Commentary is largely based upon the earlier volumes of the Urdu Tafsir Saghir, the 10 Volumes Tafsir Kabeer and unpublished notes of Mahmood Ahmad. The Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an by Mahmood Ahmad, has been published as an independent work as well.Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an by Mahmood Ahmad In 1968, a single Volume abridged Edition was also published.English Commentary of the Holy Quran(Abridged Edition )1968 The Arabic Text of the book has been given side by side with the English Translation, followed by a system of Cross-references and Notes. Background and purpose In the introduction to the work, stating the need for a modern English commentary, Mirza Mahmood Ahmad explained that all the large and systematic commentaries were in Arabic and thus of little use to those who cannot read the Quran in Arabic. Explanatory notes to their translations by non-Muslim authors had been influenced by writers who were prejudiced towards Islam. Moreover, these authors themselves knew little if any Arabic thus lacking access to the larger, more reliable commentaries and relying instead on the minor and more popular ones. Likewise, European translators and commentators seem not to have made a close study of the Quran itself, a necessary step in comprehending it by gaining an insight into its terminology, idiom and fundamentals from which its content derives its significance.Mirza Bashirud-Din Mahmud Ahmad in Malik Ghulam Farid, et al. The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Vol. I, pp. ii He also explained that the emergence of new sciences ‚Äì which expose any book that professes to give a teaching to new criticism ‚Äì merited a commentary of the Quran in light of new knowledge. Secondly, when the earliest commentaries of the Quran were written, the Bible had not been translated into Arabic, therefore when discussing parts of the Quran containing references to Biblical narratives, the commentators often relied on what they had heard from Jewish and Christian scholars, or on their own speculations, with later European writers on Islam attributing their mistakes to the Quran. Now when knowledge of the Bible had become common and with Arabic, Latin and Greek works being accessible to Muslim scholars, new avenues for understanding the parts of the Quran which contain references to the Bible or the Mosaic tradition had been made available. Thirdly, he stated that inter-religious controversies had hitherto largely revolved around matters of belief and ritual rather than those of moral and socio-political ideas or economic relations and that the contemporary world thought more in terms of these practical matters. A commentary dealing with such practical teachings of the Quran was therefore necessary. Fourthly, according to Mahmood Ahmad, the Quran contained prophecies and those prophecies which had been fulfilled up until the time of this commentary, constituted an important part of the evidence that the Quran was the revealed word of God. Fifthly, the Quran dealt with beliefs and teachings found in all other religions and ideologies, incorporating their best parts and pointing to their weaknesses and deficiencies. Earlier commentators were unaware of the teachings of these religions and ideologies and therefore unable to fully appreciate Quranic teachings regarding them. Now that all the most obscure teachings have become easily accessible and better known, a more comparative approach to the Quran vis-a-vis other religions and ideologies is possible which also demanded a new commentary.Mirza Bashirud-Din Mahmud Ahmad in Malik Ghulam Farid, et al. The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Vol. I, pp. ii-iii System of translation and commentary The authors explain to have adopted a three-fold scheme for translating and interpreting the Arabic words and expressions. First, interpreting an expression in the light of a corroborative testimony of the Quranic idiom itself. Secondly, the ‚Äòcontext‚Äô of a word or expression, which determines the meaning. Thirdly, meanings and explanations in the standard lexicons of the Arabic language, such as the Lisan al-Arab, the Taj al-'Arus, the Mufradat of Imam Raghib, the Arabic English Lexicon by E. W. Lane and the Aqrab al-Mawarud etc. Words in italics have been placed to further explain/qualify the meaning of the text. The verses have been interpreted by appending notes to them which are serially numbered throughout the Commentary. It is claimed these notes derive their authority from the spirit and tenor of the Quran. A concordance has been created to enable search for the same or similar expressions/concepts at other places of the Quran. In transliterating Arabic words, the system adopted by the Royal Asiatic Society has been followed. In explaining difficult places or expressions, the authors, according to the Ahmadiyya beliefs, have adopted an order of precedence: Quran having precedence over Hadith, after the Hadith, the Arab Lexicons, and then the factual evidence of historical events. The authors believe, the Chapters (Surahs) in the Quran, have a natural order, which also runs through the verses of each Chapter. At the beginning of each Chapter, an introduction has been given, explaining the main subject of the Chapter, the Chronology of Revelation and the questions of how every Chapter is linked to the previous one. It is claimed the Quran forms a thoroughly coherent and consistent reading. The verses of the various Chapters, and the specific position of each Chapter itself is governed by an intelligent order. The Notes, it is claimed, have been placed to refute the principal objections raised against Islam by non-Muslim critics. It is claimed that such objections were based upon ignorance or deliberate misinterpretation of the teachings of Islam. Such objections have been refuted with the intent to remove the bias and prejudice against Islam, and make a better understanding of its teachings possible. The Commentary has a system of cross-references, placed below the Text and the Translation. These give, at a glance, the various places where the subject of a particular verse has been dealt with in the Quran.

It's the city's second port after the establishment of Zayed Port in 1972.\\"Sheikh Zayed Inaugurates Zayed Port\\", Abu Dhabi Media. Retrieved 2013-06-23 The port and channel serve the adjacent Musaffah Industrial Area and the industrial areas of ICAD I, ICAD II and ICAD III. A number of large commercial and industrial companies occupy the waterfront, including steel works, shipyards, rig construction, offshore construction and supply, dredging, shipping and construction companies. Developing Musaffah  In the 1990s, after a period of local restoration and infrastructural works, interest increased in developing Abu Dhabi's nearby township of Mussafah as an industrial centre. In 1996, the Abu Dhabi Seaports Authority announced a Dh2.4 billion development plan of the area, including the building of a new port in Mussafah. In 1998, many medium-rise buildings, mostly for offices, were proposed, and a local police station was built. New Musaffah Channel Built to provide a safe navigation channel with unrestricted air draft for vessels between the Musafah Industrial Port and the Persian Gulf, a US$411 million (AED 1.5 billion) upgrade deepwater Musaffah Channel was completed and handed over to Abu Dhabi Ports in February 2011, nearly doubling the channel depth after dredging more than six million cubic metres of sand. The new channel replaced the existing access channel to the Mussafah Industrial Area. Located off the south-western shoreline of Hudayriat Island, the 53 km channel was built to better serve the Mussafah Industrial Zone and the future ICAD areas. The port facility provides for cargo operations and warehousing for a wide range of clients. A new tunnel of 280 m length links the airport with Musaffah. The Musaffah Channel is a man-made canal, with gypsum crystals described as large and bladed. The banks at the eastern end of the Musaffah Channel reportedly have \\"Pleistocene reworked dune deposits, unconformably overlain by Holocene carbonates and sabkha evaporates\\".

The first stage would be a freight line, linking Ruwais to the Shah gas field, in cooperation with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Beyond the first stage, the next priority is connecting the railway to Mussafah, to the Persian Gulf ports of Khalifa Port and Jebel Ali Port as well as the Saudi and Omani borders.

It is Peniarth 29 of the National Library of Wales, and deals with legal and historical matters. It contains also an elegy addressed at Llywelyn ap Iorwerth; king of Wales. This poem is probably written by his grand son Llywelyn ap Gruffudd who lived in the 13th century. The Black Book of Chirk was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c. 1592 ‚Äì 1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts. The manuscript's association with Chirk in north Wales is not known to go back beyond the 16th century. Aneurin Owen called it Manuscript A, of the \\"Venedotian code\\". John Gwenogvryn Evans claimed it was the oldest surviving manuscript of Welsh law, dating it to 1220, and he published a facsimile in 1909. Joseph Loth deduces a similar age in 1911 (Revue Celtique 32) and in 1932 he explains his point of view in an article (revue Celtique 48). It is now regarded as a derivative work, a partial copy of the Iorwerth Redaction in one manuscript line, and somewhat later in the century.

It is located near the Tacoma Mall along South Tacoma Way at South 56th Street and consists of a single platform and a 220-stall park- and-ride lot. Construction on the station began in early 2008 and the park- and-ride lot opened in February 2009, with service from a temporary express bus that operated until Sounder service began in October 2012. Description South Tacoma station is located southwest of South Tacoma Way at its intersection with South 56th Street in southern Tacoma. The station's platform runs along a section of Washington Street between 56th and 60th streets and includes five passenger shelters, bicycle racks, and four bicycle lockers. The southern portion of the platform is also a one-way drop-off zone for vehicles and buses and is adjacent to a 220-stall parking lot for commuters on the west side of the track, at South 60th Street and South Adams Street. South Tacoma station is located southwest of the Tacoma Mall and is in a major heavy industrial area, with some mixed commercial and residential land uses. The station has two sculptures by New York artist Ilan Averbuch, who was commissioned by Sound Transit through their public art program. At the north end of the platform is Landmark, a pair of upturned, cor-ten steel and granite arches that were inspired by the shape of train wheels and the dome of Union Station in downtown Tacoma. The End of the Line runs along most of the platform as a granite ribbon that emerges from the pavement in the shape of a railroad spike near the south end. History A commuter rail station in southern Tacoma was proposed in 1994 by the regional transit authority (later Sound Transit) as part of a line between Lakewood and Seattle. It was included in the unsuccessful 1995 ballot measure to fund regional transit and returned in the Sound Move referendum that was passed by voters in November 1996. Sound Move allocated $7 million in funding for the South Tacoma station, tentatively located at South 56th Street. The scheduled opening of the Lakewood extension, including South Tacoma's station, was originally set for 2001, but was delayed eleven years due to planning and funding issues in the early 2000s. Sound Transit named three potential sites for South Tacoma's commuter rail station and parking lot in 2000: South 58th and Adams street, South 50th Street and Burlington Way at the site of an old Northern Pacific depot, and the intersection of South 56th and Adams streets, preferred by Sound Transit and attendees of public hearings for its proximity to the street. The South 56th and Adam site, which extended south towards 60th Street, remained the agency's preferred location and was adopted by the transit board in December 2002. Looking north towards South 56th Street from the platform The site of the station was shifted to the southern alternative at South 58th Street to avoid longer delays for vehicles traveling across 56th Street. Sound Transit began acquiring properties at the station in late 2003, but ran into resistance from the owners of a century-old home at the proposed site for the park-and-ride lot. After an initial offer from the transit agency was rejected, the eminent domain case was heard by the Pierce County Superior Court and state Supreme Court, who both ruled in Sound Transit's favor by early 2006. The ruling sparked public outcry over the use of online-only meeting notices and inspired the state legislature to pass a bill requiring a certified letter to affected property owners and a newspaper notice. The landowners were eventually paid $500,000 for the property after a separate court case settled by a county jury. Construction of the $16.5 million South Tacoma station began in January 2008, with plans to prepare for commuter rail service in 2012. A temporary express bus from the station to Tacoma Dome Station and Downtown Seattle began on February 9, 2009, after the completion of station's park-and-ride lot. Sounder service to Lakewood and South Tacoma began on October 8, 2012, following a weekend celebration that drew hundreds of people to the new South Tacoma station for free rides and festivities. Services South Tacoma station is served by eight daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Lakewood station on weekdays. Sounder trains travel from South Tacoma to Seattle in approximately 71 minutes. The station is indirectly served by Pierce Transit route 3, which travels primarily on South Tacoma Way between Lakewood Towne Center, Tacoma Mall, and Downtown Tacoma. Pierce Transit formerly served South Tacoma station with several routes, including a local bus on South 56th Street that was removed in a 2017 restructure. The agency also experimented with a custom express bus from the station to University Place and Olympia that debuted in late 2013, but the program was eliminated in 2014 after a spell of low ridership.

The riot was sparked by allegations of fraud surrounding the 2008 legislative election which occurred three days earlier. While initially a peaceful protest, the riot resulted in Mongolia's first state of emergency which lasted four days, and a military presence (lasting two of those days) was brought into the city to quell the riot. Five people were killed by the police, and the headquarters of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (who had won the election) was set on fire. Additional suggested causes for the riot include a change to the electoral system which was not well understood, and an increased division between Mongolia's rich and poor population. Background In 2005 Nambariin Enkhbayar of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (known as the MPRP and the former communist party) had been elected president, having defeating the Motherland-Democracy Coalition (known as the MDC, a coalition between the larger Democratic Party, the Mongolian New Democratic Socialist Party, and the Civil Will Party). In the 2004 legislative election the MPRP lost 36 of its 72 seats in the State Great Khural (35 of them to the MDC). Following the election the MPRP formed a coalition government with the MDC. In 2005 and 2006 five Democratic Party members changed parties; four members crossed the floor to the MPRP, whilst the Deputy Chairman (Lamjaviin Gundalai) began a new party (the People's Party), having blamed the Prime Minister for \\"slow economic growth\\". In early 2006 the MPRP was able to reform a government without the MDC coalition (with the four new members who had crossed the floor). In 2007 a new chairman of the MPRP was elected who sought to \\"uproot corruption and bureaucracy\\". Before the 2008 election G√ºndalai returned to the Democratic Party, and most members of the People's Party ran as Democrats. Key issues in the upcoming election were updating the large agriculture industry and the increase in the mining industry. The MPRP supported a government controlled mineral resources, whilst the Democratic Party advocated private investment. Prior to the election more than 116,000 were listed twice (under different addresses), the General Election Committee affirmed it would be fixed prior to election day. The election saw a turnout of 74% and was stated to be \\"largely free and fair\\" by international observers. Early results saw the MPRP having taken 47 seats to the Democratic Party's 27 and the MPRP declared victory. The Democratic Party claimed the election had been fixed by the MPRP with some people voting twice. Protests On 1 July a peaceful gathering started in Sukhbaatar Square organized by the leaders of some of the smaller parties that took part in the election. Eventually a large crowd gathered, mainly of young men, surrounding the adjacent MPRP office. The group started throwing rocks at the building and began advancing on it. Police responded with tear gas and non-lethal weapons. In the evening fires were started and looting began. Both the MPRP headquarters and the Central Cultural Palace Building (which houses the National Art Gallery of Mongolia) were set fire by the crowd, estimated to be in the thousands. Art from the gallery (more than 1,000 pieces) were either \\"destroyed, damaged or looted\\". In search for weapons a police station was attacked. Looting continued through the night, despite a 10:00 pm ‚Äì 8:00 am curfew being set in place. Bricks were thrown at a fire engine, and violence in the streets erupted. A four-day state of emergency, the first in Mongolia's history was declared at by the Mongolian President, effective 11:30 p.m. on 1 July. The state of emergency placed and a ban on the sale of alcohol, authorized police to use force to stop the protesters, and prevented television broadcasts outside of those made by state-run stations. The crowds got smaller after the state of emergency was enacted, and the police were able to use additional force to stop the looting. By 2 July the military was brought into Ulaanbaatar. The President upheld the fairness of the elections, and promised investigations into the election as required. He also called an emergency national security meeting with the country's prime minister and opposition party leaders. The meeting was broadcast live on privately run Eagle Television, prime minister Sanjaagiin Bayar blamed Democratic Party leader Elbegdorj for \\"misleading people and inciting violence\\", echoing claims that he had made earlier that day. Aftermath The MPRP's headquarters were destroyed by fire during the protests. By 3 July, the situation had stabilised, with fewer troops patrolling the streets. Five people were killed in the riots, and over 300 people were injured, both civilian and police. Over 700 arrests were made during the riots, on 7 July more than 200 people were still incarcerated. Allegations of torture of prisoners were brought forward, including one person who was erroneously arrested while trying to preserve a piece of art. Some commentators and analysts suggested the problems may have been exacerbated by a growing rich/poor divide. Luvsandendev Sumati, from the polling organisation Sant Maral Foundation is reported as saying that \\"the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar have a lot of poor and frustrated youngsters who would use any pretext to get to streets and participate in any turmoil\\". A change from a first-past-the-post election process may have led to a misunderstanding over how a winner is selected.

Also on display are various furnishings and domestic items and equipment from rural areas of Sjaelland. The 19th-century farmstead in the museum are six houses, a smithy, mill, and school and also herbal plants. The museum has a steam engine which was once located at Nysted Sawmill and a harvester from 1872 which was used to plow the fields.

When the curator was offered the building for the museum in 1924, he was uncertain about what he should do with it and where it should be placed. Rather than refitting it as a riding pavilion, its original function, for years it was furnished as a rural cottage.

Sahpresa was unraced as a two-year-old, but raced until the age of six, winning eight of her twenty-two races. Apart from the Sun Chariot Stakes she won the Prix du Pin in 2010 and the Prix du Palais-Royal in 2011. She also competed in Asia, where she picked up large sums in place money when finishing third in Mile Championship (twice) and the Hong Kong Mile. She was retired from racing at the end of the 2011 season. Background Sahpresa is a bay mare with a white star bred in Pennsylvania by her owner Douglas McIntyre. Her sire Sahm, was a useful but unexceptional racehorse horse whose most notable effort came when he was disqualified after finishing second in the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in 1996. He did, however, have an exceptional pedigree, being a son of the influential American stallion Mr. Prospector out of Salsabil an Irish- bred racemare whose wins included the 1000 Guineas, Epsom Oaks and Irish Derby in 1990. Sahpresa's dam Sorpresa, was an unraced daughter of the American Champion Older Male Horse Pleasant Tap. McIntyre sent his filly to France to be trained by Rodolphe \\"Rod\\" Collet at Lamorlaye. Racing career =2008: three-year-old season= Sahpresa did not race as a two-year-old, and made her racecourse debut on 29 July when she won the Prix Faucheur over 1,600 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse by eight lengths. In September she finished third in a race at Longchamp Racecourse and then moved up in class and won the Listed Prix Coronation at Saint-Cloud by six lengths. On her final start of the season she was sent to England to take on colts and older horses in the Darley Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden by Kevin Manning, she started slowly but made progress in the closing stages to finish fourth behind the 50/1 outsider Charlie Farnsbarns. =2009: four-year-old season= Sahpresa began her four- year-old season by winning the Listed Prix de Montretout at Longchamp in May and then finished second to the British-trained gelding Beacon Lodge in the Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord at Chantilly in June. In August she was moved up to Group One class for the first time and finished fourth to Goldikova in the Prix Rothschild at Deauville Racecourse. Later that month she finished second, beaten three-quarters of a length by Racinger in the Prix Quincey over the same course and distance. On 3 October, Sahpresa ran in England for the second time when she was one of eight fillies to contest the Sun Chariot Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. She was given little chance in the betting, starting at odds of 16/1, with the 1000 Guineas winner Ghanaati being made the 6/5 favourite. Ridden by the Irish jockey Ted Durcan, Sahpresa was always among the leaders, took the lead inside the final furlong, and won by one and a half lengths from Ghanaati, with Spacious in third. Sahpresa was then sent to Japan for the Mile Championship at Kyoto Racecourse on 22 November. She finished strongly to finish third of the eighteen runners, one and a half lengths behind the locally trained winner Company. =2010: five-year-old season= Sahpresa did not appear as a five-year-old until June, when she finished eighth of the ten runners behind Strawberrydaiquiri in the Windsor Forest Stakes at Royal Ascot. She did not race again until September, when she contested the Group Three Prix du Pin over 1,400 metres at Longchamp. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon she was positioned behind the leaders before being switched to the outside in the straight. She took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won comfortably by one and a half lengths from Dalghar. Soumillon was again in the saddle when Sahpresa ran in her second Sun Chariot Stakes on 2 October. Racing on soft ground and starting at odds of 9/2 she was restrained at the back of the eleven runners before moving up to take the lead inside the final furlong. She won \\"readily\\" by one and three-quarter lengths from Strawberrydaiquiri and Rainfall. Collet called her performance \\"very impressive, maybe even more than last year I think.\\" After her win at Newmarket the mare was sold privately and entered the ownership of Teruya Yoshida. In November she again contested the Mile Championship and finished fourth in a four-way photo-finish with A Shin Forward, Danon Yoyo and Gorski. In December at Sha Tin Racecourse she finished third to Beauty Flash in the Hong Kong Mile, with the beaten horses including A Shin Forward, Good Ba Ba and Paco Boy. =2011: six-year-old season= On her first appearance of 2011, Sahpresa was matched against the leading three-year-old filly Moonlight Cloud in the Prix du Palais-Royal at Longchamp in June. Ridden by Gregory Benoist, Sahpresa was held up at the back of the field before making rapid progress in the straight. She overtook Moonlicght Cloud in the closing strides and won \\"easily\\" by one and a half lengths. In July, Sahpresa finished second to Timepiece in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket and then returned to France for the Prix Rothschild in which she faced Goldikova for the first time in two years. Held up as usual, Sahpresa finished strongly but was unable to catch Goldikova, finishing second by a short neck with Timepiece in third. In the Prix Jacques Le Marois Sahpresa was only a nose behind Goldikova, as the two finished second and third behind Immortal Verse, a three-year-old filly trained by Rod Collet's father Robert Collet. Christophe-Patrice Lemaire took the ride when Sahpresa attempted to win her third Sun Chariot Stakes on 24 September. She started 13/8 favourite in a field which included her old rivals Strawberrydaiquiri and Timepiece. The mare took the lead in the final quarter mile and ran on well in the closing stages to win by a length from the four- year-old Chachamaidee. Collet explained that he had asked for the filly to be ridden more aggressively after she had been unsuited by the slow pace in the Falmouth Stakes. For the third time, Sahpresa followed up her win at Newmarket by traveling to Japan for the Mile Championship: on this occasion she finished third, beaten a neck and one and a half lengths by Eishin Apollon and Fifth Petal. She ended her career in the Hong Kong Mile in December, when she failed to reproduce her best form and finished eighth behind Able One. Assessment and honours In the 2009 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Sahpresa was given a rating of 118, making her the 87th best racehorse in the world and the third best older female on turf in the Mile division, behind Goldikova and Vodka. Sahpresa retained her 118 rating in 2010, placing her 95th in the world and second to Goldikova in her division. In the 2011 rankings, Sahpresa again received a mark of 118, placing her 99th in the world and third to Goldikova and More Joyous among older females in the turf Mile division. Stud record At the end of the 2011 season, Sahpresa was retired from racing to become a broodmare at Yoshida's Shadai Farm in Hokkaido. She produced two fillies by Victoire Pisa and Deep Impact in 2013 and 2014. Her 2017 colt Satono Impresa won the Mainichi Hai in 2020.

He began painting in 2005, when he was about 90 years old. He is now one of central Australia's most successful artists, after winning the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2011. He was said to be the oldest artist at Pukatja, and also the community's most senior lawman (a keeper of Tjukurpa or sacred knowledge). Life Minyintiri was born into a Pitjantjatjara family some time around 1915. He was born in the bush at Pilpirinyi, Western Australia, near the border with South Australia. His childhood was spent living nomadically in the desert with his family. Their homelands were spread over a large area along the border, but they often travelled far to the east for ceremonies. They camped for several years around the Musgrave Ranges near what would later become the settlement of Ernabella. This was prior to the arrival of White people in the area; the family had their first contact with Western civilisation in the 1920s, when Minyintiri was still a child. They encountered a group of men on camels attempting to pull their truck out of a bog. Minyintiri and his family were present for the establishment of the mission settlement of Ernabella in 1937. They settled on the mission with several other Aboriginal families, and Minyintiri has lived at Ernabella ever since. He worked for most of his life as a shepherd and shearer, but became a widely respected ' (traditional healer) in his later years. He is now one of the most senior elders in his community. Before he became a painter, Minyintiri crafted traditional wooden tools (mostly spears). Minyintiri began painting at Ernabella Arts in late 2005. He painted at the art centre for a few hours each day, while his wife (now deceased) would wait outside the centre with their dogs. Minyintiri originally painted on paper, but now paints on canvas. His works have been shown in many group exhibitions since 2006, in most major Australian cities. The South Australian Museum was one of the first public galleries to show his work, which it did in a 2007 exhibition. Artwork Most of Minyintiri's paintings are done using synthetic polymer paint on canvases, although his earliest paintings were done on paper. His paintings are almost always multi-layered with strong motifs and symbols used to represent landmarks or figures. Each layer represents a different memory or part of a creation story. Because of his old age, Minyintiri only paints six to eight artworks a year. Nearly all of them are large canvases. His paintings depict sacred stories from his Dreaming. He paints songlines, or the journeys taken by the ancestral beings of his Dreaming country - such as the kanya·∏ªa (euro), malu (red kangaroo), wiilu (stone-curlew), waru (wallaby) and ka·∏ªaya (emu). His art is often also a reflection of his younger life in the desert, before settling permanently at Ernabella. The religious elements of his works are always obscured, for cultural reasons. Examples of Minyintiri's work are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, and the National Gallery of Australia. =NATSIAA= In 2010, Minyintiri's painting ' (\\"Red Kangaroo Tracks\\") was chosen as a finalist for the 27th National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. The award was won by Jimmy Donegan, another Pitjantjatjara artist, from Kalka. Minyintiri won the 28th NATSIAA in August 2011, for his painting ' (\\"Euro Tracks\\"). His work was chosen from over 300 entries, which had been reduced to 61 finalists. Minyintiri was about 96 at the time. With Donegan winning the award the year before, it was the second year in a row that an artist from the A·πâangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands had won. ' is a multi-layered synthetic painting, done on a large canvas. The background is made up of pale yellows and oranges, and is covered with a complex network of thick, ivory-coloured lines. Flashes of blue, black and pink peep through the surface lines. The judges praised Minyintiri for his subtle use of colour. His work was compared to the early batik works of Emily Kngwarreye. The painting depicts a sacred men's ceremonial site near Pilpirinyi. The network of lines traces the tracks of ancestral spirits (kangaroos, dogs and emu) to important waterholes, where men also went for their ceremonies. Each layer and line is a memory of a journey Minyintiri has made. The painting is therefore a reflection of the artist's years of travelling his country, and an expression of his ancestral relationship to the land.

Ommatoiulus sabulosus This genus is distinguished by the position of the ozopores, the shape of the ocelli and the gonopod legs, the presence of accessory claws on the juveniles, and the presence in males of a large fovea, a cavity where sperm are stored. Familiar species include the black Portuguese millipede (Ommatoiulus moreletii). It is an invasive species in Australia known for its \\"plagues\\", when it emerges in swarms so massive that they stop trains, which crush them in huge numbers and make the rails slippery. Like some other millipedes, it produces a secretion with an obnoxious odor and tendency to stain floors when the swarms invade houses.Yuncken, L. Millipede madness. ABC Science. April 5, 2007. Another well-known species is the striped millipede (O. sabulosus), which also swarms. In 2002 it flooded the streets of DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza in Poland, \\"causing panic among the inhabitants\\".

He was descended from the Huosi family, part of the Bavarian upper aristocracy (Hochadel). In 794, the cleric became the deacon of Freising Cathedral and was frequently named as a witness in the Freising documents. He is first recorded as Bishop of Freising in 812, his predecessor, Atto, however, had died over a year earlier. During his time in office, the monk and notary, Kozroh, compiled the first Freising Book of Traditions (Freisinger Traditionsbuch), which went back to 744. Under Hitto, the Freising scriptorium reached a special high point; for example, about 40 codices were written. In addition, over 300 documents from Hitto's time in office have survived. Hitto clearly strove to establish episcopal supremacy over the many, hitherto aristocratic, independent monasteries within the diocese (such as Schliersee Abbey in 817 Sch√§ftlarn Abbey in 821 or 828, and Innichen Abbey in 822). He was also the founder of Weihenstephan Abbey around 830. According to an old tradition, during his pilgrimage to Rome in 834 Hitto was given the relics of Saint Justin by Pope Gregory IV, and brought them to Freising. Hitto was buried in the cathedral crypt at Freising; his sarcophagus is preserved. His nephew Erchanbert became his successor.  Sources  *Theodor Bitterauf: Die Tradition des Hochstifts Freising.

Her claim was supported by a report from the Gerontological Society of China (GSC) but has not gained widespread acceptance due to the lack of reliable birth records in Guangxi at the time of her birth. Life and family Luo Meizhen's official identity documents claimed that she was born in Guangxi on 9 July 1885. However, these documents were issued later in life. Her birth date could not be authoritatively verified as birth records were not kept in the region until 1949. She was from the Yao ethnic group and lived in Bama county. Bama is known for the longevity of many of its residents, recording 31.7 supercentenarians per 100,000 people at their 2011 census. Luo was illiterate and worked as a farmer and housewife throughout her life. She was described as a nice but stubborn woman with a strong character. Luo had five children. Skeptics of her longevity claim pointed out that if her date of birth was as claimed, she would have given birth to her youngest son at the old age of 61.  Oldest person claim  In 2010, the Gerontological Society of China announced that 125-year-old Luo Meizhen was the oldest living person in China. This also made her a likely claimant to be the oldest living person in the world. However, the lack of official birth records meant that Guinness World Records was unable to accept the claim of longevity.  Death  After a few months of illness, Luo died of natural causes at the claimed age of 127 on 4 June 2013. She had several great-great-grandchildren by the time of her death.

Education Arthur attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn. He was a capable student and chose to specialize in physics. Research =Princeton= Arthur's interests in physics ranged over numerous fundamental and applied concepts, including conserved quantities, space and time, and thermodynamics, notably he pursued the problem of observables in general relativity and in quantum theory. As a graduate student, he worked on the problem of invariants in general relativistic spacetimes. In 1956, he gained his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton University with a thesis on the classical electron ‚Äì a topic suggested by Fritz Rohrlich. His PhD dissertation was supervised by John Archibald Wheeler, titled Some Consequences of Mach‚Äôs Principle for General Relativity. While at Princeton, he *held the Hibben scholarship, *wrote for the Nassau literary magazine, *was a four-year member of the Whig-Clio senate. *was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society at the end of the junior year.

It was released exclusively in Japan by Sony Records in March 1998. Background Some song titles differ from how they have been officially published by the Beach Boys. The most prominent of which is \\"Tones\\", which is a cover version of the instrumental Smile track \\"Holidays\\". Prior to Smiling Pets, most Smile material was only sparsely available on the compilation Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys (1993). Because \\"Holidays\\" had not been officially released until more than a decade later on The Smile Sessions (2011), it is highly likely that unauthorized bootlegs with erroneous track lists were consulted by Smiling Pets artists. \\"Tones\\" (also known as \\"Tune X\\") was actually a working title for an entirely different composition recorded by Carl Wilson during Smile sessions. Another misleading title is \\"Heroes and Villains\\", which can arguably be more accurately described as a reprise of \\"Do You Like Worms?\\". Tracks from this album later reappeared on individual band compilations or album reissues. \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" is present in complete form on Melt-Banana's MxBx 1998/13,000 Miles at Light Velocity (1999). Secret Chiefs 3's cover versions of \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains\\" are on their compilation Path of Most Resistance (2007). The Olivia Tremor Control's versions of \\"Do You Like Worms?\\" and \\"Little Pad\\" were later included as bonus tracks on reissued releases of Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle (1996). An album similarly-fashioned to Smiling Pets was released two years earlier, entitled The Christmas Album, which was a tribute to the compilation A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector (1963). It was also compiled by Seiji Morita and included some of the same performers. The Ships and FORMS are aliases of the Olivia Tremor Control and Secret Chiefs 3, respectively. OnoTetsu is the pianist for Harpy, an experimental Japanese noise band. Short Hair Front and Feelds were short-lived bands seemingly led by the album compiler Seiji Morita, and he is credited as arranger for their contributions \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\" and \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\". Little is known about the album's more unrecognizable artists Sports Guitar or R. Gree & Grey Tea. They may also be pseudonyms. Critical reception Writing in his 2005 book about Smile, Domenic Priore praised Smiling Pets and highlighted \\"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\\" and \\"Cool, Cool Water\\" as stand-out tracks.

He is a well-known figure in the world of sports results manipulation and is sought worldwide for his opinion and feedback on program's aimed at tackling corruption in sport. He has worked in sport integrity at FIFA and INTERPOL and is currently the Sports Integrity Director at the International Centre for Sport Security.  Early life and education  Born on 22 February 1952, Eaton attended Caulfield High School in Melbourne and later the Australian Graduate School of Police Management in Sydney. He went on to complete a graduate certificate at the Charles Sturt University in New South Wales.  Career  Eaton has over 40 years' public service experience in the fields of international law enforcement, security and integrity. = The International Centre for Sport Security = Eaton joined the International Centre for Sport Security in April 2012, a non-profit organisation led by President Mohammed Hanzab, Vice-President Mohammed Al Hajaj Shahwani and Executive Director, Helmut Spahn. Eaton has spoken out against a number of issues including the state of English football, match- fixing in Africa, the need for governmental involvement in match-fixing and general corruption in sport including the Indian Premier League. His primary role is to promote integrity reform in the sport industry and support the creation of international measures to combat integrity threats to sport. = FIFA = In December 2010 Eaton was appointed as the security adviser to FIFA for the 2010 World Cup South Africa‚Ñ¢, and later, FIFA's head of security, Eaton was responsible for all FIFA interests and assets against risk and threat and oversaw the development of an internal investigation program to target match-fixing and criminal behaviour within football. The program included managing a team of international investigators, a first for FIFA at the time. Eaton initiated unique institutional tools for sport to combat corruption in football, including a hotline and website in 180 languages, the offer of amnesties, rewards and rehabilitation for anyone who revealed important information. The introduction of these tools was delayed when FIFA came under independent governance scrutiny. Eaton saw many in the worldwide sporting industry punished for profiting from the illegal betting industry with ongoing match-fixing investigations in about 50 countries, due in part to his global law enforcement contacts and forceful approach. His resignation was a setback for the infamous Asiagate scandal as Eaton was also instrumental in the arrest of the Singaporean man at the center of the match-fixing debacle, Wilson Raj Perumal. = INTERPOL = In 1999 Eaton was sent by the Australian Federal Police to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), where he was eventually responsible for running INTERPOL's 24/7 Command and Coordination Centre, the global, operational, monitoring hub of INTERPOL. During this period Eaton was also seconded from INTERPOL as a senior UN Special Investigator with the Independent Inquiry Committee, managing international investigations of allegations of fraud and corruption within the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Program in Iraq. = Police service = Eaton began his career, in 1969, with the Victoria police, a state police service in Australia, transferring five years later to then Commonwealth Police, which later renamed the Australian Federal Police. Eaton served as a federal agent and also spent over 10 years as the National Secretary of the Australian Federal Police Association, the professional representative body of federal police employees, during which time he called for the abolition of the National Crime Authority. He is a recipient of the Australian Police Medal.  Personal  Eaton is married with six children (two sons and four daughters) and two grandchildren. He currently resides in Doha, Qatar.

Lajos √Åprily (birth name Lajos J√©kely) was a Hungarian poet and translator who won the 1954 Attila J√≥zsef Prize for his contributions to Hungarian literature. √Åprily was born 14 November 1887 in Brass√≥, Austria-Hungary (now the city of Bra»ôov in Romania) and died 6 August 1967 in Budapest; he was the father of Zolt√°n J√©kely (1913-1982), also a poet and translator. √Åprily's poems usually made use of classical forms and versification; they are characterized by impressionistic descriptions of nature. Major themes of his poetry are nature, family, grief over the loss of loved ones, and the ideas of peace, humanity and mutual respect between individuals and nations. His basic mood is warm, melancholic, reserved and unpretentious. He was a champion of disciplined, tight forms; his style embodied elegance, taste and refinement. From 1921 to 1965 he published several collections of poems and translations from French and Russian; he also wrote verse dramas, translating Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, Ibsen's Peer Gynt and other works. Biography Lajos √Åprily's original name was Lajos J√©kely. He attended elementary and secondary school in Parajd (now Praid, Romania) and Sz√©kelyudvarhely (now Odorheiu Secuiesc), two towns which still have Hungarian-speaking majority populations. From 1899, he studied at the Protestant Reformed College in Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca). His teachers included famed musicologist and folklorist J√°nos Sepr≈ëdi (1874‚Äì1923) and Hungarian writer and editor Dezs≈ë Kov√°cs (1866‚Äì1935). To this day Cluj retains a sizable ethnic Hungarian minority population. In 1909 J√©kely earned his teacher's degree and became instructor of German and Hungarian language and literature at Bethlen G√°bor Koll√©gium in Nagyenyed (Colegiul Na»õional Bethlen, Aiud, Romania). In 1911 he married Ida Sch√©fer; in 1913, whilst they were still living in Nagyenyed, their eldest son, the poet, writer and translator Zolt√°n J√©kely, was born. After Kov√°cs had reprimanded him over the supposed \\"modern tone\\" of some of his poems, J√©kely refrained from publishing for several years. In 1918, however, he began using the pen name Lajos √Åprily for his writings in the magazine Uj Erd√©ly (\\"New Transylvania\\"). He soon became a member of three literary societies, Erd√©lyi Irodalmi T√°rsas√°g, Kisfaludy T√°rsas√°g and Kem√©ny Zsigmond T√°rsas√°g. By 1923 he had earned a degree in French language at the University of Burgundy in Dijon. In 1926 he and his family returned to Cluj, the same town where he had studied from the age of 12, when it had been known as Kolozsv√°r.

In 1929 the family moved from Romania to Budapest, where in 1934 the poet was named as director of Ba√°r-Madas, at that time a boarding school for girls. One of his pupils there was the polyglot poet and translator √Ågnes Nemes Nagy (1922-1991). In the fall of 1935 he began a half-year study tour in northern and western Europe. In 1942 the family moved back to Praid in Transylvania for a short time, before they resettled in 1943 to Szentgy√∂rgypuszta, a farm near Visegr√°d.

Whatawhata - Te Kowhai Golf Club and bus stop on Store Rd History and culture =Pre-European history= Whatawhata was a NgƒÅti MƒÅhanga village and there are still Te Papa-o-Rotu and Omaero maraes on the west bank of the river. In early colonial times Whatawhata was one of many sites in Waikato with a flour mill. It was built in 1855 and producing flour by the end of that year. The area must have been suited to wheat, for there was another mill about downstream, at Karakariki, by 1860. =European settlement= British troops arrived at Whatawhata over land and by river, as part of the Invasion of the Waikato, on 28 December 1863. Whatawhata was described as having no end of peach trees, which the soldiers stripped of their fruit. Within a year a telegraph line had been built. A 1915 guide described Whatawhata as, \\"six miles from Frankton Junction, along a good metalled road. Coaches run to and from Frankton Junction daily, the fares being 2/- single and 3/6 return. The principal industries are farming and dairying. There is one hotel in the township, also school, and post and telegraph office. Small steamers ply up and down the river from Huntly, the waters being navigable as far up as Pirongia. Whatawhata was in the early days an important Maori centre, having at one time a native population of over a thousand.\\"The Raglan and Kawhia Districts: E. Bradbury & Co. 1915 Since then the post office has been replaced by a petrol station and dairy, the coach has become 4 per day and the river is rarely disturbed by any craft. Also the AgResearch hill-country research station at Whatawhata was started in 1949.http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato- region/page-9 Across the road from AgResearch, Campbell Coal Ltd developed a coal mine in 1920, was advertising for about 10 tons a day to be carried to Hamilton in 1921 and had it fully open by 1923. It produced 9,272 tons in 1945 from a seam, employing 6 miners and 5 surface workers. Hallyburton Johnstone said there was never a strike at the mine. The coal was sub-bituminous with a fairly high calorific value, but was largely worked out by the 1970s, when Hamilton gasworks closed. 2.9m tons is estimated to be still recoverable. An 1880 guide said, \\"It is about ten miles distant from Hamilton, but a sum of money has been voted for making a direct road through a large swamp, which will bring the Hamilton station within six miles of the township. The road to Raglan crosses the, Waipa river here, and a bridge will shortly be built, when the ferry, which is now worked by natives, will be done away with. Heavy goods, such as timber, wire and manure, are brought up by the Waikato Steam Navigation Company's steamers. . .

Types of online qualitative research In addition to online focus groups and IDIs, online qualitative research can include diaries, blogs, market research online communities (MROCs), and ethnography. There are two main forms of online focus group, synchronous and asynchronous. Individual depth interviews (IDIs) - Traditionally conducted face to face or by telephone, IDIs typically involve an interview between the researcher and the research participant lasting 30‚Äì60 minutes. Diaries and blogs - In this type of research, participants record information over a given time period, as specified by the researcher. Often, this method is used to ensure that participants undertake (and make a record of) certain tasks before taking part in focus groups. When diaries are used, the information is not shared with other participants. Conversely, when using blogs the information is shared both with participants and researchers. Market research communities - These typically involve participants taking part in various research activities over a period of time, rather than taking part in one research event, such as an online focus group. The activities often include short surveys, quick polls, online focus groups, and participant-led discussion forums. One could argue that communities are either a form of quantitative or qualitative research, depending on the number of participants and the nature of the research tasks they undertake. Market research communities (MROC's) have seen a significant development in the U.S and are starting to reach the European market. A community can be seen as a place where \\"traditional\\" research and innovation tools are utilized in one single platform over a period of time. Short communities consist of a period of time between 3 weeks and 6 months, while an ongoing community is anything beyond 6 months. Market researchers usually adopt online communities through third- party technology suppliers. Benefits of online qualitative research The online approach can offer significant time and cost savings compared to other methods, and provides much greater convenience for researchers, participants and observers. It also allows for greater sophistication in the segmentation of the sample because participants can be recruited online, whether from databases, panels, surveys or other sources, rather than just by traditional means. Setting up and running an online qualitative research project involves far less administration than is the case with face to face qualitative research, and this makes it practical for client-side organisations to do so without a market research agency. This is further supported by the fact that the process of moderation is easier online than face to face, because the moderator is not dealing with people together in a room. In fact, one could argue that an important benefit of online qualitative research is that it is much less dependent on the moderator than is face to face research. Online qualitative research results It is argued by some that online qualitative research results cannot be as ‚Äúgood‚Äù as face to face research results, because of the absence of face to face contact between participants and a moderator. A moderator, it is argued, can interpret participants‚Äô tone of voice or body language in a way that is not possible online. The counter argument to this is that in a face to face environment there are numerous reasons why participants should not be as honest or forthcoming as they would be in an anonymous online environment. Therefore, the moderator is needed in order to help overcome these reasons. For example, the participant might feel their honest answer makes them look stupid, selfish or unhelpful and so they give a different answer. Or they might have a different view to the majority of the group, but are reluctant to mention it for fear of this leading to the moderator focusing on them for a long period of time.

Trishna was given the singular honour thereafter of being transported to New Delhi and displayed on a tableau during the Republic Day Parade, 1987. The sail-off crew members Prelude On 28 September 1985 Trishna set sail from the Naval Sailing Club jetty at Colaba, Mumbai with General Arun Shridhar Vaidya, then-Chief of Army Staff accompanied by Lt. Gen. P.R. Puri, Engineer-in-Chief flagging off the First Indian Expedition Around the World. Team The team consisted of ten members, with six on the boat at any one time, of which four were permanent crew: * Maj K. S. Rao, SC, SM, - Skipper * Maj A. K. Singh, KC, SM * Capt Sanjeev Shekhar, SC * Capt Chandrahas Bharti, SC * Maj Amreshwar Pratap Singh, SM(Bar), VSM - sailed from Mumbai to Panama; * Capt Rakesh Bassi, SM - sailed from Mumbai to Trinidad; * Lt Navin Ahuja, SM sailed from Trinidad to Auckland; * Col T. P. S. Chowdhury, AVSM, Team Manager, sailed from Panama to Sydney; * Maj A. Bhattacharya, SM, sailed from Auckland back to Mumbai; and * Maj S. N. Mathur, SM, sailed from Sydney back to Mumbai. Circumnavigation =Bombay to Trinidad= The sailing expedition commenced from Bombay, India on 28 Sept 1985. Right from the time Trishna left harbour, she ran into the low pressure weather system of the receding monsoons which accompanied her till her first port of call at Male and thereafter to Mauritius on 25 October 1985. The boat was hit by severe storms on several occasions which damaged the VHF and HF radio aerials and electrical systems on board. The crew resorted to makeshift repairs at sea to restore communication and navigation systems. After a brief halt, the boat set sail from Port Louis, Mauritius on 30 October 1985. The sail to Saint Helena, South Atlantic Ocean around the Cape of Good Hope was rough and the longest non-stop leg of the trip, taking 33 days. Trishna on one occasion was swamped by a rogue wave and lost most of her life-saving equipment in the incident. The radio set was damaged and the antenna on the masthead broke. Communication with Mumbai and other ports was cut off. The sail across the South Atlantic Ocean was peaceful and Trishna reached St Helena on 2 December 1985. Trishna navigates the stormy seas off the Cape of Good Hope The boat reached Ascension Island on 15 December 1985. Staying ashore or mooring on the island was not permitted and Trishna had to tie up alongside the oil tanker Maersk Ascension which is permanently anchored off the island. The sail thereafter till the Caribbean Sea was largely calm. The winds remained predominantly South-Easterly. The first port of call on the continent of South America was at the coastal town of Natal. The crew celebrated the New Year of 1986 there with their Brazilian Navy hosts. From there, the boat sailed along the coast and then up the Para River to the port of Belem. Trishna had to sail upstream on this tributary of the Amazon River for 70 nautical miles against strong currents and myriad dangers in the form of fishing nets, unlit fishing trawlers and huge log floating down. Most of this distance was completed at night. The next halt was at the port of Paramaribo, Suriname. The country has a large East Indian origin population and programs in Hindi were broadcast by the local radio station. It was a short hop from there to Georgetown, Guyana. The crew received an enthusiastic reception from the large Indian-origin population here. The Guyana Defence Force arranged a visit to the Kaieteur Falls by air during the short stay there. Trishna then proceeded to the Caribbean port of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago for the first crew change of the voyage. The first crew change took place here and Capt R. Bassi was replaced by Lt. Navin Ahuja. =Trinidad to Panama City= The boat then sailed to Bridgetown, Barbados and then to Kingston, Jamaica. From there the boat crossed the Panama Canal. At Panama City, the boat was taken out of the water and overhauled at the local US Naval Base. Minor repairs were carried out, barnacles removed and the hull was given a fresh coat of anti-fouling paint by the crew. =Panama City to Auckland= The voyage in the northern Pacific Ocean was relatively calm. With good winds Trishna sailed the 3,200 nautical miles ‚Äì from Galapagos to Marquesas Islands non-stop in 23 days. This was her fastest passage so far. Trishna halted at Tahiti and then sailed onward to Raratonga and Suva, Fiji. The weather remained adverse on the leg from Fiji to Auckland. Winter had already set in the Southern Hemisphere by this time and the sail was extremely punishing for the crew in the wet and cold conditions. Trishna again had a perilous encounter with some whales between Raratonga and Fiji. On three occasions whales came within 10 to 15 meters of the yacht, dived underneath and swam nearby flipping their huge tails. =Auckland to Sydney= One of the most difficult legs of the voyage was the passage from Auckland to Sydney across the Tasman Sea. The leg was sailed from 3 to 17 Aug 1986. Trishna was hit by gales continuously for five days. The sails were ripped off and for the first time in the expedition, the 'hove-to' drill was carried out to ensure that the boat did not suffer major damages. The same storm meanwhile struck Sydney, causing the worst inundation of the city in the century. =Sydney to Bombay= The leg Sydney - Brisbane - Cairns - Thursday Island continued in rough weather, as predicted during the winter months. The voyage was difficult, though spectacular, owing to the sail along the Great Barrier Reef. Navigation was critical while sailing through the numerous reefs and on one occasion the boat ran aground on a moving sandbar. Fortunately, there was no damage though the crew had to wait till the next high tide to sail the boat off. The sail through Torres Straits again caused anxious moments as the Strait is only about a mile wide and it was a challenge navigating through this narrow passage. From Thursday Island to Darwin was a pleasant sail and the crew finally got some respite from adverse weather conditions. This gave the crew opportunity to work on the communication equipment to re-establish radio communications with India through the HAM network. Since rounding the Cape of Good Hope, there had been no direct communication between the boat and India. Maj SN Mathur was an expert HAM operator and he soon established a regular link with India. Trishna left Darwin, North Australia on 13 October 1986 for Kupang, Timor. From there the boat sailed to Waingapu in Sumba and then to Bali, Indonesia. Good 'following' winds helped Trishna reach Bali on 22 October 1986. Bali has many Hindu temples and the crew arrived during one of the main Hindu festivals, Diwali, the festival of lights. This was the third Diwali celebrated by the crew away from home. The yacht set sail from Bali on 2 November 1986, reaching Jakarta on 9 November; then via Singapore and Penang, Trishna made its first landfall on Indian shores at Campbell Bay, Nicobar on 10 December 1986. It was a momentous occasion and was celebrated with gusto with the whole crew present on the occasion. Maj KS Rao, the Skipper, also received his long-delayed promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel here. The home run via Colombo, Sri Lanka was uneventful. Trishna received an enthusiastic welcome at the Gateway of India, Mumbai on her arrival there on 10 January 1987 where she was received by General Krishnaswamy Sundarji, the Chief of the Army Staff (India) accompanied by a large gathering of sailors, Service officers, friends and relatives. Achievement Ten officers of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers in a sailboat girdled the globe ‚Äì 30,000 nautical miles ‚Äì in less than 16 months creating Indian maritime history. They are the first Indians to circumnavigate the globe on Trishna - in Sanskrit the name means to fulfil their 'thirst' of sailing around the world. Honours and awards Trishna was given the singular honour of thereafter being transported to New Delhi and took part on a tableau during the Republic Day Parade, 1987. This in itself was a herculean effort as the boat had reached Mumbai on 10 Jan 1987 itself and to participate in the Republic Day Parade on 26th, the boat had to be transported to New Delhi, the tableau to be fabricated to the exacting standards of the Ministry of Defence and cleared by their internal committee well before the rehearsals commenced. It seemed an impossible task, but with the concerted efforts of all those involved, the Indian Railways provided the carriage, Naval Dockyard Mumbai fabricated the boat cradle overnight on the railway carriage and then again the Railways moved it at express speed, literally, to New Delhi. The Bengal Engineer Group, Roorkee sent their fabrication team and completed the fabrication work at Vijay Chowk itself since the boat with its 54 ft high mast could not be transported anywhere else in the capital. A commemorative postage stamp was released by India Post on the arrival of the boat back in Bombay on 10 January 1987. The crew of Trishna was also honoured with the Order of Merit by the Ocean Cruising Club which recognised the voyage as the first circumnavigation by an Indian yacht. The Government acknowledged this achievement by announcing awards for the whole crew on Republic Day, 1987. Maj AK Singh became the first disabled sailor to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat. Book Publication Celebrated author, Dom Moraes volunteered to write an account of the historic voyage. The book named 'Trishna' was published by Perennial Press Mumbai and was released on 10 March 1988 at a glittering function held at the College of Military Engineering, Pune. The book received rave reviews and in the reviewer's words \\"Trishna is, in essence Moraes' personal tribute to the heroes whose courage and ability inspired him to undertake what, for him, is a new literary voyage.\\" He had earlier written an exhaustive account of the voyage in the Imprint magazine soon after the completion of the voyage.

He fell under the influence of the Birmingham Marxist writer George Thomson and joined the choir of the local branch of the Workers' Music Association, which was run by Thomson's wife. In 1957, he formed a skiffle group, initially called the Clarion Skiffle Group, which performed politically-charged material including Fenian and Jacobite songs, and songs of miners, industrial workers and farmworkers. In 1958, the group changed their name to the Ian Campbell Folk Group and in 1962 recorded Ceilidh At The Crown, at the Crown Inn in Station Street Birmingham, their regular venue.

With the raising of the school leaving age from fourteen to fifteen in 1944, the expansion of Naenae and wider Lower Hutt, and the start of the post-World War II baby boom, Naenae College was built to accommodate secondary school students north of central Lower Hutt. Naenae College was a prototype for a standardised building design to be used at other new secondary schools across New Zealand. The school was built with long two-story wings of classrooms facing onto corridors, constructed with reinforced concrete on the first level and timber above that. However, construction of the so-called \\"Naenae type school\\" was too slow and expensive for a large scale building programme, and subsequently the Naenae type was largely replaced with a single-storey all- timber version known as the \\"Henderson type school\\". Both types lasted four years before being phased out in 1957 in place of self-contained classroom blocks. The school opened for instruction at the beginning of 1953. John Russell was principal from 2007 to 2017. Enrolment Naenae College does not operate an enrolment scheme, so the school is open to enrolment from any eligible student. Its effective service area is central-north Lower Hutt, including the suburbs of Avalon, Belmont, Boulcott, Epuni, Fairfield, Kelson, Naenae and Wingate. However, Naenae College is easily accessible from most of the Hutt Valley, with bus routes to Petone, central Lower Hutt, Stokes Valley and Upper Hutt passing outside the school's front gate, and Naenae Railway Station a five-minute walk away. At the August 2010 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, Naenae College had 737 students. The school roll's gender composition was 48% male and 52% female. The school is highly multicultural, with its ethnic composition at the ERO review being 30% MƒÅori, 25% New Zealand European (PƒÅkehƒÅ), 15% Samoan, 6% South East Asian, 4% Chinese, 2% Indian, 2% Cook Island MƒÅori, 2% Tokelauan, 2% Fijian, 2% Other Pasifika, and 10% Other. The school has a socio-economic decile rating of 3G (low-band decile 3), meaning it draws its school community from areas of moderately-high socio-economic disadvantage when compared to other New Zealand schools. The current decile came into force in January 2015, after a nationwide review of deciles following the 2013 Census. Previously, Naenae had a decile of 2F (high-band decile 2).

The vessel was built to a new design by Nantong Mingde Heavy Industries at their shipyard in Tongzhou, China in 2013. The ship entered service in December 2013, operating in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. Design and description Algoma Equinox was constructed to a new design of lake freighters that operate on the Great Lakes by the design firm Delta Marine. Algoma Central asserted that new design and new technology will make the new vessels 45 percent more energy efficient than their earlier vessels. Algoma Equinox is a \\"gearless bulker\\" meaning she has to use shore facilities to load and unload. Two of the new gearless vessels will be owned by the Canadian Wheat Board, but operated by Algoma Central, on the Board's behalf. Algoma Equinox is long overall with a beam of . The vessel has a gross tonnage (GT) of 23,895 and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 39,400. Each crew member has an individual cabin, with an en-suite washroom, broadband internet, and satellite TV connections. Service history The vessel was ordered as part of Algoma Central's plan to renew their Great Lakes shipping fleet. The ship's keel was laid down on 21 April 2012 by Nantong Mingde Heavy Industries at their shipyard in Tongzhou, China. Algoma Equinox was launched on 24 December later that year and completed on 25 September 2013. The ship then crossed the Pacific Ocean and passed through the Panama Canal arriving at Port-Cartier, Quebec in September 2013. The vessel made its maiden voyage through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway in December 2013. Algoma Equinox primarily transports iron ore and grain in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. Captain Ross Armstrong of Algoma Equinox received the Top Hat as the first ship through the Welland Canal for 2014 at the Welland Canals Centre at Lock 3 in St. Catharines, Ontario on 28 March 2014. Due to ice conditions on Lake Erie, she was unable to complete the journey into the lake that day. Algoma Equinox was featured on Season 8 Episode 4 of the Discovery Channel's program Mighty Ships.

History =Origins of the clan= Despite their name, this Murray family were not part of the Clan Murray in Atholl but were in fact a sept of the Clan Sutherland, whose chiefs were the Earls of Sutherland. The Earls of Sutherland were originally a family named \\"de Moravia\\", meaning \\"of Moray\\" or \\"of Murray\\" and shared a common ancestor with the chiefs of the Clan Murray in Atholl. According to historian George Harvey Johnston, all of the different families of Moray or Murray were all apparently descended from the Morays of Bothwell (ancestors of the Murrays of Atholl), but the connecting lines are now lost and the origin of each family is a matter of conjecture or dispute. The same historian also states that the Earls of Sutherland and all their cadets were descended from Moray of Bothwell. The Murrays of Aberscross or Aberscors seem to have arrived in Sutherland in 1198. Hugo or Hugh de Moravia, second son of Freskin, was appointed as the first Lord of Sutherland and his son, William, was the first Earl of Sutherland (d. 1284). In Hugo or Hugh's entourage were his cousins, or nephews, Richard de Moravia and Gilbert de Moravia who are said to have been the ancestors of the Murrays of Aberscross. Richard was a soldier who was famous for successfully defending the coast of Sutherland from the Vikings at the Battle of Embo in 1245, and Gilbert became Bishop of Caithness and Sutherland. Gilbert granted to his brother Richard the lands of Skelbo, and they remained with Richard's descendants for two centuries. Richard's successors were men of distinguished valour and in high repute among their contemporaries for their war-like virtues. They held extensive possessions in the county of Sutherland and were allied with the powerful family of Sutherland. =Feuds with the Mackays= As septs of the Clan Sutherland, the Murrays of Aberscross were the principal vassals of the Earls of Sutherland and were charged with the defense of the shire. The Murrays of Aberscross led the Clan Sutherland in many battles during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly against the Clan Mackay, including the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1431 where Angus Moray of Aberscross was killed. Neil Murray of Aberscross led the Clan Sutherland at the Battle of Skibo and Strathfleet in 1480 against the Clan Donald. According to historian D. M Rose, the 7th and 8th Earls of Sutherland did little to advance their family's reputation, leaving their kinsman the Morays of Culbin, Pulrossie and Aberscross to fight their battles. =Vassals of the Gordon Earls of Sutherland= Later in the early 16th century a younger son of the Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon, married an heiress of the last de Moravia Earl of Sutherland.Gordon. pp. 83 - 84. Murray of Aberscross may have been for a time partisan to Alexander Sutherland who rivaled the Gordon's claim to the Earldom of Sutherland. However, the Murrays of Aberscross then supported the new Gordon Earls of Sutherland at a number of battles including the Battle of Torran Dubh in 1517 against Mackay of Strathnaver, and the Battle of Alltachuilain in 1518 or 1519 against Alexander Sutherland himself.Gordon (1813). pp. 95-97. Murray of Aberscross was victorious on both occasions,Gordon (1813). pp. 95-97. and was then offered women in marriage for his loyalty by the new Gordon Earls of Sutherland but he declined the offer. Historian Robert Mackay states that: \\"The year 1518 Adam (Gordon) Earl of Sutherland gave unto John Murray of Aberscors (Shiberscross), for his two sons Hugh and Thomas, the ward and marriage of Janet Clyne, and of her sister Elizabeth, the daughters and heirs of William Clyne of Clyne: all which and more did John Murray and his children deserve at Earl Adam his hands for their good service in defence of his earldom and country\\".Mackay Robert. (1829). p. 97. According to Charles Gordon, 11th Marquess of Huntly (d. 1937), Earl Adam Gordon of Sutherland fled from the field of Flodden where his brother, the gallant Laird of Gight was killed, and that when his brother-in-law Alexander Sutherland tried to assert his right to the Earldom of Sutherland by force of arms, he remained quietly at home and got Leslie of Kinninvie and the old warrior Laird, Murray of Aberscross, to fight his battles and recover his wife's possessions. Retaliation and vengeance against the Sutherlands was mainly suffered by the Murrays whose lands in Rogart and Dornoch were often laid waste. In 1542 Hutcheon Murray of Aberscross led the Clan Sutherland at the Battle of Alltan-Beath against the Clan Mackay where the Mackays were defeated. =Feuds with the Earl of Caithness= In 1570 a feud arose between the Gordon Earl of Sutherland and the Earl of Caithness, chief of Clan Sinclair. Caithness was supported by his father-in-law the Sutherland Laird of Duffus, (a descendant of the old de Moravia Earls of Sutherland). Caithness made Duffus's brother, William Sutherland of Evelick, attack the Murrays of Aberscors (Aberscross) in vengeance, taking prisoner John Croy-Murray. Hugh Murray of Aberscors then assembled his friends and made incursions upon the lands of Evelick as well as laying waste to several villages belonging to the Laird of Duffus and taking hostage a Sutherland gentlemen to secure the safety of John Croy-Murray. The Sutherland Laird of Duffus then gathered all of his kinsmen at Skibo Castle and proceeded to the town of Dornoch with the intention of burning it. However, the Murrays went out and met them in battle, overthrowing them and pursuing them back to the gates of Skibo. Prisoners were then exchanged for John Croy-Murray. This was known as the skirmish of Torran- Roy. On hearing of the news of the skirmish of Torran-Roy, the Earl of Caithness sent the Master of Caithness who, along with the Mackays, besieged the Murrays in Dornoch Castle and the church. The Murrays held out for a week before surrendering after which the several Murrays of Aberscors were beheaded. George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness later imprisoned his son, the Master of Caithnes, for making peace with the Morays. Hugh Murray of Aberscross married a daughter of John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, chief of the Clan Mackay, and had a son by her also called Hugh who is recorded in a charter from William Sutherland of Duffus, dated 21 February 1581, as \\"son and heir of Hugh Moray of Aberscross and grandson, and one of the heirs of, John Mackay of Strathnaver\\". A list from 1587 of clans who had a captain, chief or chieftains on which they depended but at times against the will of their land- lords includes the \\"Murrayis, in Suthirland\\". A list of clans in two Acts of Parliament in 1587 and 1594 includes the \\"Murrays, or Sutherlands\\". In 1590 John Morray of Aberscross was killed leading the Clan Sutherland against the Earl of Caithness at the Battle of Clynetradwell.Gordon (1813). pp. 202-203. =Loss of the Aberscross estate= According to Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, in 1631, Alexander Morray of Abiscors (Aberscross) died after a fall from a stair.Gordon (1813). pp. 449-450. He left one son and two daughters. Half of the estate went direct to the Earl of Sutherland while the other half also went to the Earl of Sutherland because of the death of the last Laird of Duffus who was superior of that part of the estate under the Earl. According to Gordon, who himself was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, John, Earl of Sutherland dealt nobly with Alexander Morray, his wife and his children in respect of the ancient and faithful service that the family had given to the Sutherlands. He gave part of the estate to the old widow (mother of Alexander and wife of John Morray of Aberscross), part to the widow of Alexander, and part to the children of Alexander to maintain, while another part was reserved to the Earl as acknowledgment of his superiority. According to Gordon, the estate of Abiscors (Aberscross) became so overburdened with debt that it would never again be redeemed by the true and lawful heirs. =Jacobite risings= During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the tacksman of Aberscross led twenty men in support of the Earl of Sutherland at the Skirmish of Alness against the Jacobites. Aberscross castle Today nothing remains of the family's castle at Aberscross which fell into ruin in the 17th century. Aberscross Castle was held by the de Moravia (Murray) family from when they first moved to Sutherland at the end of the twelfth century.

As a defense analyst working together with John Boyd and Thomas P. Christie, he was a member of the self-dubbed 'Fighter Mafia', which advocated the use of energy‚Äìmaneuverability theory in fighter design. Sprey was born in Nice, France, and raised in New York.. He was educated at Yale, where he studied aeronautical engineering and French literature, and also at Cornell, where he studied mathematical statistics and operations research. He subsequently worked at Grumman Aircraft as a consulting statistician on space and commercial transportation projects. From 1966 to 1970 he was a special assistant at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. After 1971, Sprey left the US Department of Defense, but continued working as a consultant on military issues until 1986, when he became a recording engineer and later founded the Mapleshade Records label.  Defense analyst, criticism of the F-15  During the 1960s, Pierre Sprey belonged to a group of defense analysts who called themselves the 'Fighter Mafia'. At the time he joined them, he had been a weapons system analyst working for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Analysis. The 'Fighter Mafia' group of defense analysts worked behind the scenes in the late 1960s to advocate a lightweight fighter as an alternative to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The Fighter Mafia strongly believed that an ideal fighter should not include any of the sophisticated radar and missile systems or rudimentary ground-attack capability that found their way into the F-15. Their goal, based on energy‚Äìmaneuverability theory, was a small, low-drag, low-weight, pure fighter with no bomb racks. The Fighter Mafia influenced the design requirements of the highly successful General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, although they were not happy with design changes made to the YF-16 as it became a costlier multi-role fighter rather than the lighter air-to-air specialist they originally envisioned. Sprey continues to be critical of the F-15 fighter. Pierre Sprey left the Pentagon in 1971, continuing to consult on the F-16, A-10, armor and anti-tank weapons. He also helped lead two consulting firms, one active in international defense planning and weapons analysis. At this time, Sprey continued to work in combat data-based cost effectiveness analysis of air and ground weapons. He and Colonel John Boyd worked with others in the Pentagon and Congress toward military reform, helping gain passage of military reform legislation in the early 1980s.  Criticism of the F-35 and A-10 divestment  Pierre Sprey gained wide notability as a frequent critic of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II program. He argues, paralleling his earlier arguments against the F-15, that despite its high cost (likely over 200 million dollar per plane depending on the number purchased), the F-35 is less agile than the F-16. Compared to the F-16 or A-10 (in both of whose operational roles it is marketed to operate) the F-35 as overweight and dangerous, stating ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if Detroit suddenly put out a car with lighter fluid in the radiator and gasoline in the hydraulic brake lines: That‚Äôs how unsafe this plane is‚Ä¶\\" and \\"full of bugs\\".. The Russian state-controlled online magazine Sputnik News quoted Sprey as saying: ‚ÄúThe F-35 is so bad it is absolutely hopeless when pitted against modern aircraft. In fact, it would be ripped to shreds even by the antiquated MiG-21‚Ä¶‚Äù He argues that in the close air support role, the F-35 is a poor A-10 replacement as it flies too fast for pilots to spot targets with their eyeball and lacks maneuverability at low speeds. He says It lacks the necessary radios, cannot survive small arms fire (or anti-aircraft guns) and has poor loiter time. Sprey contends that close air support should be the Air Force's most important mission and that the USAF has been trying to retire the A-10 for years simply because it does not want the CAS mission.  Response to Sprey's criticism of the F-35  Pierre Sprey gained wide public notability after having been interviewed on his views of the F-35 by the popular-audience press, by Russian state-owned media such as Russia Today and Sputnik News,which quoted him as saying, \\"The F-35 is so bad it is absolutely hopeless when pitted against modern aircraft. In fact, it would be ripped to shreds even by the antiquated MiG-21,\\" Sprey told RT, commenting on a recent expert report, which dismissed the F-35 project as a total failure. on the politics and policy news network C-SPAN, at a meeting of the activist group \\"Stop the F-35\\", and during a podcast of a debate between Sprey and a retired US Marine Corps combat pilot and instructor at the \\"TOPGUN\\" United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program who has piloted both the F-35B STOVL variant and the F-22, on the website of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine. Advocates of the F-35 state that the plane's unit costs will range between 80 and 95 million dollars when larger numbers of aircraft are purchased. Sprey said in an interview with the CBC's The Fifth Estate that the F-35 would likely cost over 200 million per plane (including development costs rather than excluding them). Sprey is sometimes credited in popular-audience media as being a \\"co-designer\\" of both the A-10 and F-16 aircraft. In other cases he is simply cited as helping to design these planes. An introduction to a podcast debate between Sprey and Lt. Col. David Berke (US Marine Corps (ret.), a former combat pilot and instructor at the \\"Topgun\\" United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program) said Sprey \\"helped conceptualize the design of the F-16 and A-10 fighters.\\" Sprey took no part in the designing of these aircraft. 2017 saw widespread questioning of Sprey's perspective on the F-35. In the Paris Air Show that year, an F-35A demonstrated a range of complex aerobatic maneuvers that led commentators in the aviation and popular press to question Sprey's allegations that the F-35 was incapable of flying at low level, at low speeds, or with the agility of the F-16. In addition, defense-related blogs carried interviews with pilots who fly and train others to fly the F-35 who report that it has higher angle of attack and better close-in maneuverability than the F-16 during dogfighting.‚ÄúMy experience so far is that the F-35 makes it easier for me to maintain the offensive role [compared to an F-16], and it provides me more opportunities to effectively employ weapons at my opponent.‚Äù On September 28, 2018, an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter crashed in South Carolina. The US, UK, and Israel each subsequently grounded their entire fleet of F-35s. On October 12, Pierre Sprey stated in an interview with Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear show that \\"the reason for both the high cost and low quality of the plane's parts is the way the procurement system operates. Built into this system are incentives for cost overruns and corruption by military brass who go on to lucrative defense contracts after they retire.\\"  Record production  Pierre Sprey now records music through his own label \\"Mapleshade\\" and sells high-end audiophile equipment. His recording with the Addicts Rehabilitation Center (ARC) Choir singing \\"Walk With Me\\" appears in Kanye West's 2004 hit \\"Jesus Walks.\\" Sprey said he earned enough royalties from the West song \\"to support 30 of my money-losing jazz albums.\\" Sprey's recording techniques are highly unconventional, aiming for accurate reproduction of live music rather than manipulating sounds (e.g. with equalizers, pitch correction, etc.) to make mediocre artists sound good. He records with only two tracks as the multitracking approach compromises the reproduction of the live music experience.

Footscray recorded an upset victory against Essendon by 28 points, giving the VFA one of its most significant victories, on-field or off-field, against its stronger rival competition. The match raised ¬£2,800 for the fund. Background Dame Nellie Melba In 1897, eight of the strongest clubs in Victoria broke away from the Victorian Football Association to form the Victorian Football League. Since that time, the two competitions had been strong off-field rivals, with the VFL assuming the position as the strongest competition in the state, and generally doing little to assist the VFA. The VFA had often tried to arrange matches against the VFL, particularly a championship playoff match between the two premiers, in an attempt to lift its own prestige and gate takings, but such offers were almost always rejected by the league. By 1924, a total of only two matches between the VFL and VFA had taken place, excluding pre-season practice matches. These were: *In 1902, the VFL 9.17 (71) defeated the VFA 4.3 (27), in a representative match to raise money for the benefit of former player Fred McGinis. *In 1915, (VFA) 8.9 (57) defeated (VFL) 4.7 (31), for the benefit of Lady Stanley's Fund for Australian Wounded Soldiers. In 1924, it was proposed to stage a match between the VFL and VFA for the benefit of the Limbless Soldiers' Appeal, organised by Dame Nellie Melba. It was decided that the match should be a playoff between the premiers of each competition, the first time such a match had ever been staged; on the historical significance of the match, future Hall of Fame sportswriter Reginald Wilmot commented \\"Nothing but the appeal of Dame Nellie Melba, on behalf of the limbless soldiers, could have induced the League to agree to a game which they have strenuously opposed for nearly 30 years.\\" Arrangements Arrangements for the match began to be drawn up in late September. Essendon was in a position to claim the VFL premiership with a win or narrow loss on 27 September, but a heavy loss would require a Grand Final to have been played on 4 October. Footscray had claimed the VFA premiership on 20 September, and was available to play on either 27 September or 4 October, but had already scheduled a tour of Gippsland which precluded playing the match on 11 October. As such, for the game to be played at all, Essendon would need to win the premiership without a Grand Final ‚Äì which it did with a 20-point loss to on 27 September. The benefit match was then scheduled for 4 October. Richmond made itself available to replace Footscray, should the VFL and VFA have been unable to reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for the game. The Australian Football Council, of which the VFL was a member and the VFA was not, gave its consent for the match to be played, but stipulated that the game must be played on a VFL ground, and under VFL rules. At the time, the VFA and VFL played under mostly the same rules, including each fielding eighteen players per side, with only a few technical differences, so Footscray was not put at any significant disadvantage as a result of this. The two competitions were permitted by the AFC to compromise on the appointment of umpires, so VFA umpire Leheny officiated in the first and third quarters, and VFL umpire McMurray officiated in the second and final quarters. The supplier of football also alternated through the match between Sherrin (VFL) and Don (VFA). The Melbourne Cricket Club made the Melbourne Cricket Ground available free of charge for the match, and the umpires also donated their time to the cause. Admission cost 1/- to the outer, and 2/6 to the grandstand. Playing in a VFL venue, Essendon was the home team, and wore black knicks. The League was considered the top level of football in the state, and was considered to be a class above the Association in quality; as such, it was generally thought that Essendon would easily defeat Footscray. Footscray, which had dominated the VFA by winning the previous five minor premierships, had recruited heavily from the League over the previous few years, and fielded a total of nine former senior VFL players for the game ‚Äì including five who had played with Essendon ‚Äì and considered itself a strong chance to cause an upset. Both teams were at near full strength for the match; Footscray's eighteen was unchanged from its premiership winning team, and Essendon was permitted to field its captain- coach Syd Barker, Sr., because a suspension he was still serving was valid only in premiership matches, which this game was not. The match was promoted as the 'Championship of Victoria', although it had no official status as such. Match Crowd at the Championship of Victoria, with inserted images of club captains Con McCarthy (Footscray) and Syd Barker (Essendon) The match was played in front of a crowd of 46,100, on par with a typical VFL finals or Grand Final crowd in the early 1920s. The majority were supporting Footscray, with many fans of many other VFA clubs supporting Footscray as a means of supporting the VFA against the VFL. At the time, it was the highest crowd an Association club had ever played to, exceeding the then-record Association crowd of 41,000 which saw the 1908 Grand Final. The match raised more than ¬£2,800 for the appeal. In the curtain raiser, VFL wooden spooners 19.16 (130) defeated NSWAFA runners-up Newtown 8.11 (59) by 71 points. Essendon won the toss and kicked to the Punt Road end of the ground in the first quarter. Essendon started well, with Tommy Jenkins kicking the first goal inside the first minute of play, and kicking another shortly afterwards. Thereafter, Footscray did most of the attacking for the quarter, but finished with only two goals, and were repeatedly repelled by the Essendon defenders, particularly Watt, Fitzmaurice, Donaldson and Maher. Essendon kicked a late goal to lead by four points at quarter time. Play in the second quarter was similar, with Footscray doing most of the attacking and Essendon mostly keeping them out; Mullens (Footscray) kicked the only goal of the quarter, but two late behinds allowed Essendon to take a one-point lead into half time. Roy Laing (Essendon) was off the ground with a leg injury for much of the second quarter, eventually finishing the game in the forward line, but was too injured to have any impact. After half time, Footscray began to assert its dominance, particularly by handball. Footscray scored two goals in the third quarter ‚Äì Punch early in the quarter and O'Brien near the end ‚Äì to take a two- goal lead into three-quarter time. Both teams attacked early in the final quarter, Footscray managing three goals, but Essendon managing only four behinds, to put the result beyond doubt. At this stage, Footscray had kicked eight of the last nine goals in the game, and Essendon had kicked 0.11 (11) since quarter time. Both teams managed a late goal, and Footscray won the game by 28 points. Overall, despite the match being close for three quarters, Footscray was the better team in all aspects of the game throughout the match ‚Äì to an extent which surprised many onlookers who expected Essendon to win comfortably. In particular, Footscray was able to move the ball with the extensive use of handpassing ‚Äì their technique was close to a throw, and was considered borderline illegal by reporters at the time, but was allowed by both umpires. Essendon's defence played admirably, but many of its midfielders and forwards were ineffective on the day. Aftermath The victorious Footscray Football Club was admitted to the VFL, along with VFA clubs and , prior to the following season. The VFL's decision was not based entirely on on-field merit, with strategic drivers and off-field strength also taken into consideration, so whether or not Footscray's win in this match had any direct bearing on its admission is a matter which divides football historians. Nevertheless, Footscray had been unsuccessfully applying to join the VFL for many years, and believed the exposure which came with playing this game, even without the prestige which ultimately came with winning the game, would be helpful to its ultimate goal of gaining admission. Some VFA delegates believed that Footscray's win, by affirming the VFA's strength, was the prime motivation for the VFL to admit three clubs in 1925 rather than one ‚Äì to maximise the damage to the VFA and to assert its own superiority. In an interview with the Sporting Globe newspaper in 1935, Essendon defender Tom Fitzmaurice made allegations that some of his teammates had taken bribes to play stiff during the game, fixing the result in Footscray's favour, and told the newspaper that his disgust at this conduct had prompted him to leave the Essendon Football Club after the season; rover Charlie Hardy made the same allegations of match-fixing to the newspaper the following week, alleging that he believed Essendon's last finals match against Richmond the previous week had also been fixed. Their allegations were vague, as neither man was himself offered any bribe, nor gave the names of any players they believed to have been bribed ‚Äî although some of Hardy's allegations were understood to have referred to captain-coach Syd Barker, Sr., who had died in 1930, precluding any response to the claims. Neither the League nor the Association ever investigated or proved Fitzmaurice's and Hardy's allegations, so the veracity of their claims is unknown.

Objectives Russia's 1993 currency reform was intended to tame inflation and exchange the banknotes remaining in circulation from 1961 to 1992 for banknotes of a new design. The reform was confiscatory, as there were a number of restrictions on the exchange of banknotes. In addition, the reform was carried out during the summer holidays, which created additional problems for citizens. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation issued a clarification that the exchange of banknotes after 1 October 1993 would be made exclusively on presentation of documents that proved the impossibility of exchange in a timely manner. That restriction was also aimed at combating the influx of currency notes from the former Soviet republics, as the central banks of the Republics ceased to look to Russia's State Bank and started printing their own money.–ï–≥–æ—Ä –ì–∞–π–¥–∞—Ä: \\"–ó–∞ —Ä—é–º–∫–æ–π –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤—ã–µ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –Ω–µ —Ä–µ—à–∞–ª–∏—Å—å\\" In 1993, the central banks of the former member states began issue of their national currencies to replace the former Soviet ruble, which was a threat to Russia since the old rubles could be sent to Russia and would destabilise its financial system. The official aims of the reform were the fight against inflation, the retirement of the old treasury bills of the State Bank of the USSR and the separation of the monetary systems of Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The ruble would be a means of payment in only domestic money circulation. In fact, on 17 July 1993, Russia withdrew from the ruble zone of the CIS, the ruble as a means of payment in the interconnected CIS economy virtually ceased to exist, Viktor Chernomyrdin's government deprived Russia of its ability to control all the cash and the issue of the economy depended on it republics of the ruble zone. Non-cash rubles in payments between the republics also ceased to exist. Terms The terms of monetary reform were set out in a telegram to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation N 131-93 of July 24, 1993, signed by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia, Viktor Gerashchenko: Initially, the exchange limit was set at 35,000 non-denominated rubles (at the time, about US$35). The country started to panic. Two days later, President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree where the exchange amount was increased to 100,000 rubles (about US$100) per person, and the deadline was extended until August 1993. Citizens of Russia (according to registration in the internal passport) could change the amount of 100,000 rubles, as stamped in passports. Rumours of reform went ahead, the authorities denied them and the reform was carried out during the holiday season, when many were away from their place of residence. The limitation was also aimed at combating the influx of currency notes from the former Soviet republics. As a result, many people did not physically have time to exchange their cash savings, and their money was gone. Enterprises could exchange cash within cash balances at the beginning of the day on July 26 and had to surrender them to the bank for the banking day on July 26. Amount of money handed over was not to exceed the limit set for the box office of the organization, and the amount of sales proceeds received by the cashier at the end of the day on July 25. Results The reform did not strengthen the ruble. In fact, it led to serious complications with its neighbours, as their currencies were tied to the ruble. The central bank had to transfer some of the new banknotes to Kazakhstan and Belarus. In the second half of 1993, Russia tried to negotiate with the neighbors on the establishment of a new type of ruble zone, but only Belarus signed an agreement to combine their monetary systems in the future.

It was among the twelve original baronies of the Principality of Achaea, but was conquered by the Byzantines in the early 1260s. History The Barony of Passavant was the last of the original twelve secular baronies of the Principality of Achaea to be established. While most of the others were formed c. 1209, after the conquest of the peninsula by the Crusaders, Passavant was created shortly after 1218/20 for the French knight John de Nully. He established the fortress of Passavant or Passava‚Äîthe name probably derives from the war-cry or family motto \\"passe avant\\", but is also found as a toponym in northeastern France‚Äîon the mountains between the Mani peninsula and the plain of Laconia.Miller (1921), pp. 71‚Äì72, 89Bon (1969), pp. 508‚Äì509 John of Nully is generally supposed to have been the son of Vilain of Nully, a native of Nully and close friend of the historian Geoffrey of Villehardouin. John did not take the cross until 1218, and arrived in the Peloponnese probably not until 1220.Bon (1969), p. 113 His barony probably comprised newly conquered land‚Äîit was not until c. 1248, with the fall of the last Byzantine fortress, Monemvasia, that Laconia was fully pacified‚Äîwith four knight's fiefs. It was militarily important, since it kept watch over the unruly Maniots and the Slavic inhabitants of Mount Taygetos, and Nully was named hereditary marshal of Achaea.Miller (1921), pp. 72, 89Bon (1969), pp. 73, 113, 508‚Äì509 Virtually nothing is mentioned about the barony or its fiefs in the sources.Bon (1969), p. 509 To fill the period between its foundation and the 1260s, the historian Karl Hopf hypothesized that there were two barons of Passavant, both named John, but this conjecture was rejected by Antoine Bon. John of Nully married a sister of Walter of Rosi√®res, the Baron of Akova, and had a single daughter: Margaret of Passavant, the common heiress to both Passavant and Akova. However, Margaret never entered her inheritance, since she resided in Constantinople as a hostage in the Byzantine court from 1262 until c. 1275. In the meantime, Passavant had fallen to the Byzantines during their first offensives in the Peloponnese, c. 1263, and the Barony of Akova was confiscated by the Prince because Margaret delayed too long in claiming her inheritance. In the end, after a legal struggle, she received back a third of the barony of Akova.Bon (1969), pp. 105, 113, 135, 508‚Äì509 References Sources * * Category:States and territories established in 1220 Category:States and territories disestablished in the 1260s Category:Medieval Laconia Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea ","title":"Barony of Passavant"},{"id":"39754652","text":"The Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education was an Australian government department that existed between December 2011 and March 2013\\\\.

In 1591, the Safavid shah Shah Abbas (r. 1588‚Äì1629) asked Khan Ahmad Khan's daughter Yakhan Begum to marry his son Mohammad Baqer Mirza, since Khan Ahmad Khan had no male successor. Khan Ahmad Khan disagreed due to the age of his daughter. This and some other economic factors caused a Safavid raid in 1591 and Khan Ahmad Khan escaped to Ottoman territories, and spent the rest of his life in Constantinople and Baghdad, spending fruitless attempts to return to power. He died in 1596 and was buried in Najaf, one of the holiest cities of Shia Islam. Biography =First reign= Map of northern Iran Khan Ahmad Khan's father, Soltan-Hasan Kiya, died in 1538 because of plague. Khan Ahmad Khan, who was only an infant at the time of his father's death, was thereafter crowned as the new king of the Karkiya dynasty of Bia-pish (eastern Gilan). He was shortly given Bia-pas (western Gilan), thus becoming the ruler of whole Gilan. However, the brutality of the Karkiya army in Bia-pas made its inhabitants invite a certain Amira Shahrok to become the ruler of Bia-pas. This Amira Shahrok was a distant relative of Mozaffar Soltan, who was the former ruler of Bia-pas, but had been burned alive by the Safavids two years earlier. Amira Shahrok first arrived to Bia-pas a few years later (January 1544), where he began minting coins in the name of the Safavid shah Tahmasp I (r. 1524‚Äì1576). Seven years later, Khan Ahmad Khan managed to persuade Tahmasp I to have Amira Shahrok executed, who was unable to meet the demands of the Qizilbash chieftains. A certain Soltan Mahmud, who was a son of Mozaffar Soltan, was then appointed as the new ruler of Bia-pas. However, Khan Ahmad Khan once again complained to the court, stating that Soltan Mahmud was not unable to rule. Soltan Mahmud was shortly exiled to Shiraz, where he was shortly poisoned under the orders of Khan Ahmad Khan. He thus became the sole ruler of Gilan once again. Tahmasp I, 16th-century portrait. Tahmasp I, in order to reduce the power of Khan Ahmad Khan, who had shown signs of misbehaviour and had not been at the court for 20 years, appointed a son of Soltan Mahmud and a relative of his, Jamshid Khan, as the new ruler of Bia- pas. Furthermore, he also ordered Khan Ahmad Khan to give Kuchesfahan back to its former ruler Amira Sasan. Although Khan Ahmad Khan had accepted to cede Bia-pas, he refused to cede Kuchesfahan, which he claimed had always been a part of Bia-pish. This resulted in the latter rebelling. Tahmasp I then sent an envoy under Yulqoli Beg Zu'l-Qadr to Gilan in order to make peace. In June 1567, Khan Ahmad Khan's commander Shah Mansur Lahiji inflicted a heavy defeat on Amira Sasan near Siah-rudbar. Around the same time, Yulqoli Beg Zu'l-Qadr, who was at Rasht, was killed and beheaded‚Äîhis head was sent to Khan Ahmad Khan, who shortly entered Rasht in celebration. Tahmasp I, still hoping to be able to make peace, sent an aggressive letter to Khan Ahmad Khan, reciting his crimes and rebellious behaviour, but promising to pardon him if he would visit the court. The latter shortly sent a letter back, making excuses for not visiting the court for 20 years, but stated he still refused to visit the court. Tahmasp I, already enraged at Khan Ahmad Khan for having Soltan Mahmud poisoned, and hiding the wanted Ghiyat al-Din Mansur from the Safavids, sent a group of troops under several Qizilbash chieftains to Gilan to capture him. Khan Ahmad Khan quickly assembled his men and prepared for battle, but his army under Kiya Rostam, the military governor of Rasht, was shortly defeated, forcing him to flee. = Imprisonment = Picture of the Qahqaheh Castle. The Safavid army in Gilan brought horror to its inhabitants by looting and destroying estates and killing people while searching for Khan Ahmad Khan, who was in the end captured and imprisoned in the Qahqaheh Castle in Azerbaijan. During his time there, he befriended Tahmasp's son Ismail. Tahmasp, worrying that a rebellion would occur in the castle, sent Khan Ahmad Khan to a fortress in Estakhr in Fars, where he would remain for 10 years. When Tahmasp died in 1576, Ismail was freed by his Qizilbash supporters, who shortly killed his brother Haydar Mirza Safavi, due to his claim to the throne. They thereafter crowned him as the new shah. After his accession, he ordered Khan Ahmad Khan to be released, an order, which, however, was not executed by his men. Ismail II was assassinated the following year, and was succeeded by his older but weaker brother Mohammad Khodabanda, who, at the proposal of his queen Khayr al-Nisa Begum (who was a close relative of Khan Ahmad Khan) had Khan Ahmad Khan released. He was thereafter taken to Qazvin, where Mohammad Khodabanda gave him one of his sisters (Maryam Begum) in marriage and restored him as the ruler of Bia-pish. = Second reign = Khan Ahmad Khan's return to Gilan was the start of a new period of fierce conflicts that would last for 15 years and would even involve the governor of Shirvan. Right when Khan Ahmad Khan arrived in Gilan, he invaded Bia-pas, but was routed by Jamshid Khan, who had the captives slaughtered and their heads put together so it looked like a minaret. This, however, did not stop Khan Ahmad Khan's hopes of conquering Bia-pas, which he would invade several more times.  Aftermath  Shah Abbas arrived in Lahijan a few days later, where he had Khan Ahmad Khan's palace totally destroyed, and appointed Mehdi Qoli Khan Shamlu as the governor of Bia-pish, while Ali Beg Soltan was appointed as the governor of Bia-pas. Khan Ahmad Khan's former vizier Khvajeh Masih Gilani, who had earlier fled to the Safavid court, played a major role in the invasion of Gilan, and was for that awarded with the title of rish-safƒ´d (\\"the elder\\") of Bia-pish. A few years later‚Äîin 1594/5‚Äîthe Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg Ordubadi, together with a group of administrators and accountants, were sent to Gilan, where they improved the structure of tax charge and contribution, which, supposedly, was done at the demand of the residents who were discontent with the oppressive governorship of Mehdi Qoli Khan Shamlu. More likely, however, this reform took place due to the economic capability the province offered‚Äîits rich silk manufacture, tea, caviar, and lumber encouraged Abbas I to dispatch his most prominent officers to overhaul the economic system of the province in a just approach.

CAST markets software quality and size (automated function points counting) measurement technology and expertise, and offers software, hosting and consulting services in support software analysis and measurement. The company was founded in 1990 in Paris, France, by Vincent Delaroche. CAST code quality metrics are frequently used in application development service-level agreements. CAST research and experts are often consulted on issues having to do with development quality and security by medias such as Los Angeles Times, BBC, CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, and The Economist.  History  CAST was founded in 1990 in Paris by Vincent Delaroche. In 1996 CAST shipped its first software product, an interactive development environment for building database SQL stored procedures. In 2001, the company introduced software quality measurement into its analysis products. CAST Application Intelligence Platform, its current flagship product, was first launched in 2004. In 2012, CAST announced support for the Object Management Group (OMG) Automated Function Point (AFP) Standard, an effective way to measure application development productivity. CAST leadership includes Bill Curtis, who developed the Capability Maturity Model at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in the early 1990s and then the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ). CAST's head of product development, Olivier Bonsignour, co-wrote a book with Capers Jones.  Research  CAST‚Äôs Research Labs subsidiary developed a repository of industry data and issues a biennial report called CAST Research on Application Software Health (CRASH). CRASH data has been cited and published in articles in IEEE Software and researches. CAST Research Labs was active in analyzing the phenomenon of technical debt, co-hosting a research forum on this topic with University of Maryland‚Äôs department of information systems. CAST focused on analyzing applications instead of technology layers and as a consequence, most of the research had been conducted in the domain of inter- and intra-technology dependency analysis. Among them the project which leads to the detection of security problems at the architectural level in response to the need acknowledged by Hoglung, G and McGraw, G in Exploiting Software. CAST was recognized by Oseo in 2009 and awarded the \\"Innovative Company\\" label. This recognition was renewed in 2012 through another project aiming at identifying the possible resource leaks that can contribute to application performance decrease or application crashes, at the application level across the layers and without requiring the actual execution of the application as is usually the case in dynamic program analysis.

Between 2013 and 2015, he held the posts of Minister of Diaspora Affairs, Minister of Economy and Minister of Religious Services. From 2015 he continued as Minister of Disapora Affairs and became Minister of Education. From 2019 to 2020 he was Minister of Defense Born and raised in Haifa, the son of immigrants from the United States, Bennett served in the Sayeret Matkal and Maglan special forces units of the Israel Defense Forces, taking part in many combat operations, and subsequently became a software entrepreneur. In 1999, he co-founded and co-owned the US company Cyota, operating in the anti-fraud space, focused on online banking fraud, e-commerce fraud, and phishing. The company was sold in 2005 for $145 million. He has also served as CEO of Soluto, an Israeli cloud computing service, sold in 2013 for a reported $100‚Äì130 million. He entered politics in 2006, serving as Chief of Staff for Benjamin Netanyahu until 2008. In 2011, together with Ayelet Shaked, he co- founded the My Israel extra-parliamentary movement. In the 2013 Knesset elections, the first contested by The Jewish Home under Bennett's leadership, the party won 12 seats out of 120. Early life Naftali Bennett was born in Haifa, Israel, on 25 March 1972. He is the youngest of three sons born to Jim and Myrna Bennett, American Jewish immigrants who moved to Israel from San Francisco in 1967, a month after the Six-Day War. His father's Jewish roots come from Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. His maternal grandparents moved to San Francisco from Poland 20 years before the outbreak of World War II, and relocated to Israel as seniors, settling on Vitkin Street in Haifa. Some of his mother's other family members who remained in Poland were murdered in the Holocaust. Both of Bennett's parents observed Modern Orthodox Judaism. After moving to Israel, they volunteered for a few months at kibbutz Dafna, where they studied the Hebrew language, then settled in the Ahuza neighborhood of Haifa. Jim Bennett was a successful real estate broker turned real estate entrepreneur. Myrna Bennett was the deputy director general of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel's northern program. When Bennett was four, the family moved to Montreal for two years as part of his father's job. Upon returning to Haifa, Bennett began attending Carmel elementary school. When he was in second grade, the family moved to New Jersey for two years, again as part of his father's job. The family returned to Haifa when Bennett was ten. Bennett has two brothers. One, Asher, is a businessman now based in the United Kingdom. The other, Daniel, is an accountant for Zim Integrated Shipping Services. Naftali Bennett attended Yavne Yeshiva High School in Haifa, and became a youth leader (\\"Madrich\\") with the religious Zionist youth organization Bnei Akiva. =Military career= Bennett was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1990. He served in the Sayeret Matkal and Maglan commando units as a company commander;Gal Perl Finkel, Wisdom is in the timing, The Jerusalem Post, December 12, 2019. he continues to serve in the reserves today with the rank of major. Bennett served in the Israeli security zone in Lebanon during the 1982‚Äì2000 South Lebanon conflict. He took part in many operations, including Operation Grapes of Wrath. After his IDF service, Bennett received a law degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During the 2006 Lebanon War he was called up as a reservist in the Maglan special forces unit and participated in a search and destroy mission behind enemy lines, operating against Hezbollah rocket launchers. Some of Bennett's actions as a special forces commando are controversial, particularly in his involvement in Operation Grapes of Wrath, when he called in artillery fire after his unit came under mortar fire, and the resulting shelling hit a United Nations compound in which civilians were taking refuge, an incident that became known as the Qana massacre. Journalist Yigal Sarna argued that Bennett displayed \\"poor judgement\\" while serving in the Maglan commando unit during the operation. Sarna argued that \\"Bennett led a force of 67 combat troops into Lebanon. At a certain point, he decided to ignore orders and change operational plans, without coordinating these moves with his superiors, who in his mind were cowardly, and not steadfast enough. Near the village of Kfar Kana, Bennett's troops were caught in an ambush... 102 civilians were killed, and 10 wounded, of them four United Nations peacekeepers.\\" Bennett responded, \\"I have now been subjected to an attack claiming that I am 'responsible for the massacre in Kfar Kana'. Heroism will not be investigated. Keep looking in the archives. My military file is available for viewing, and it's waiting for you.\\"WAS NAFTALI BENNETT RESPONSIBLE FOR A MASSACRE OF LEBANESE CIVILIANS? BY JPOST.COM STAFF JANUARY 6, 2015 Former members of Bennett's unit wrote a letter defending him, saying: \\"Naftali... led many successful operations that led to the elimination of Hezbollah terrorists deep in enemy territory\\". BY LAHAV HARKOV, ARIEL ZILBER JANUARY 6, 2015 =Business career= Bennett moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan to build a career as a software entrepreneur. In 1999 he co-founded Cyota, an anti-fraud software company, and served as its CEO. The company was sold in 2005 to RSA Security for $145 million, making Bennett a multimillionaire.RSA Security to Acquire Cyota; Creates Leading Provider of Layered Authentication Solutions , RSA Security Inc. Press Release A stipulation of the deal allowed the Israeli arm of Cyota to remain intact. As a result, 400 Israelis are employed at the company's Israeli offices in Beersheba and Herzliya. Bennett has also served as the CEO of Soluto, a technology company providing cloud-based service that enables remote support for personal computers and mobile devices in 2009, at a time when he and partner Lior Golan were engaged in raising funds for myriad Israeli technology startup companies. Soluto had hitherto raised $20 million from investors, including venture capital funds Giza Venture Capital, Proxima Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Index Ventures, Michael Arrington's CrunchFund, Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors and Initial Capital. The sale of Soluto for a reported $100‚Äì130 million to the American company Asurion was finalized in October 2013. =Return to Israel, entry into politics, and personal life= After moving on from software entrepreneurship, Bennett returned to Israel and embarked on a career in politics. His wife, Gilat, was secular, but now observes the Jewish Sabbath and religious Jewish kosher laws regarding food. She is a professional pastry chef. The couple have four children, and live in Ra'anana, a city about north of Tel Aviv and from the Mediterranean. Like his brothers, Bennett observes Modern Orthodox Judaism. Political career Minister of Education Naftali Bennett (right) with Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked (above center), Minister of Culture Miri Regev (left), and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (below center) After taking part in the 2006 Lebanon War, Bennett joined the Leader of the Opposition, Benjamin Netanyahu, and served as his Chief of Staff from 2006 to 2008. He led a team that developed Netanyahu's educational reform plan. He also ran Netanyahu's primary campaign to lead the Likud party in August 2007. On 31 January 2010 Bennett was appointed director-general of the Yesha Council and he led the struggle against the settlement freeze in 2010. He served in this position until January 2012. In April 2011, together with Ayelet Shaked, he co-founded My Israel, which claims to have 94,000 Israeli members. In April 2012 he founded a movement named \\"Yisraelim\\" ‚Äì i. e., \\"Israelis\\". The movement's main goals include increasing Zionism among centre-right supporters, increasing dialogue between the religious and secular communities, and promoting \\"The Israel Stability Initiative\\". Subsequently, Bennett resigned from the Likud and joined The Jewish Home, while announcing his candidacy for the party leadership. In the internal elections on 6 November 2012 he won 67% of the vote, and was elected head of The Jewish Home. In the 2013 legislative elections Bennett led the party to win 12 seats in the 19th Knesset. Following his election to the Knesset, Bennett had to renounce his U.S. citizenship, which he held as the son of American parents, before he could take his seat.Six new MKs must renounce foreign citizenship  JPost  Israel News He was appointed Minister of the Economy and Minister of Religious Services in March 2013. In April 2013 he was also appointed Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs. As a senior Cabinet Member, he plays a major role in financial, political and security affairs. After being reelected in the 2015 elections, Bennett was appointed Minister of Education and retained the Diaspora Affairs portfolio in the new government. In 2015, Netanyahu split the Ministry of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs, initially taking back the Jerusalem Affairs portfolio for himself. He later appointed Ze'ev Elkin to the role of Jerusalem Affairs Minister. As Minister of Education, Bennett issued an official order prohibiting school principals from inviting members of Shovrim Shtika and other organizations that denounce Israel's military conduct in the West Bank. Under Bennett's supervision, the Ministry of Education changed the school curricula to increase the number of visits to heritage sites in Judea and Samaria. In October 2015 Bennett resigned from the Knesset in order to allow Shuli Mualem to take his seat. His resignation took place under the Norwegian Law, which allowed ministers to resign their seats when in the cabinet but return to the Knesset if they leave the government.Bennett resigns from Knesset, will continue to serve as education minister The Jerusalem Post, 7 October 2015 He returned to the Knesset on 6 December 2015 after Avi Wortzman opted to vacate his seat,Bennett to return to Knesset The Jerusalem Post, 2 December 2015 having temporarily had to resign as a minister in order to do so.Bennett resigns as minister, in order to return to Knesset Israel National News, 3 December 2015 Following Avigdor Lieberman's resignation as Defense Minister in November 2018, Bennett announced that he was seeking the position for himself. On 16 November 2018 a Likud Party spokesman announced that Netanyahu had rejected Bennett's request and that Netanyahu himself would take the position instead. It was then announced that Bennett's Jewish Home Party would no longer be affiliated with Netanyahu's government, but on 19 November Bennett reneged on his pledge to withdraw from Netanyahu's coalition. In December 2018 Bennett was among the Jewish Home MKs to leave the party and form the breakaway New Right party.Bennett, Shaked quit Jewish Home, announce formation of ‚ÄòHaYamin HeHadash‚Äô The Times of Israel, 29 December 2018 In the 2019 Knesset elections, New Right narrowly failed to cross the electoral threshold; as a result, Bennett did not gain a seat in the 21st Knesset. In June 2019 Netanyahu dismissed Bennett from the government. Political positions =Israeli-Palestinian conflict= election foreign- policy debate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 8 January 2013 In February 2012 Bennett published a plan to manage the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict called \\"The Israel Stability Initiative.\\" The plan is based in part on parts of earlier initiatives, \\"Peace on Earth\\" by Adi Mintz and the \\"Elon Peace Plan\\" by Binyamin Elon, and relies on statements of Netanyahu and Likud party ministers in favor of unilateral annexation of the West Bank. Bennett opposes the creation of a Palestinian state: \\"I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state.\\"David Remnick (21 January 2013), The settlers move to annex the West Bank‚Äîand Israeli politics. The New Yorker He suggests a tripartition of the Palestinian territories, whereby Israel would unilaterally annex Area C, authority over the Gaza Strip would be transferred to Egypt, and Area A and Area B would remain with the Palestinian National Authority, but under the security umbrella of the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet to \\"ensure quiet, suppress Palestinian terrorism, and prevent Hamas from taking over the territory\\". Area C constitutes 62% of the area, and approximately 365,000 people live in Israeli settlements. Palestinians who live in this area would be offered Israeli citizenship or permanent residency status (between 48,000, according to Bennett, and 150,000, according to other surveys).Chaim Levinson (17 January 2013), Bennett's West Bank plan ignores existence of about 100,000 Palestinians Haaretz Finally, Israel would invest in creating roads so Palestinians can travel between Areas A and B without checkpoints, and invest in infrastructure and joint industrial zones, because \\"Peace grows from below ‚Äî through people, and people in daily life\\". Bennett also resists immigration of Palestinian refugees now living outside the West Bank, or the connection between the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In 2011 he noted that there were about 50 factories in the West Bank industrial region where Israelis and Palestinians work together, and cited this as one workable approach to finding peace between the two sides.\\"Do West Bank Realities Defy Perceptions?\\", by Gary Rosenblatt, Jewish Week, Tuesday, 25 January 2011. Bennett suggests that Israel must learn to live with the Palestinian problem without a \\"surgical action\\" of separation to two states: \\"I have a friend who's got shrapnel in his rear end, and he's been told that it can be removed surgically, but it would leave him disabled... So he decided to live with it. There are situations where insisting on perfection can lead to more trouble than it's worth.\\" Bennett's \\"Shrapnel in the butt\\" thus quickly became widely known as representing his view of the Palestinian problem.\\"Bennett urges 'coexistence' with Palestinians, Lapid calls for 'honest divorce'\\", The Jerusalem Post, 21 June 2013. In response to Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners in 2013, Bennett said Palestinian terrorists should be shot, allegedly adding, \\"I already killed lots of Arabs in my life, and there is absolutely no problem with that\\". Bennett was widely condemned for these words, though he denied saying them, claiming he said merely that \\"terrorists should be killed if they pose an immediate life threat to our soldiers when in action\\". In January 2013 Bennett said, \\"There is not going to be a Palestinian state within the tiny land of Israel\\", referring to the area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. \\"It's just not going to happen. A Palestinian state would be a disaster for the next 200 years.\\" In December 2014 a group of academics who oppose the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and members of The Third Narrative, a Labor Zionist organization, called on the U.S. and E.U. to impose sanctions on Bennett and three other Israelis \\"who lead efforts to insure permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and to annex all or parts of it unilaterally in violation of international law\\". The academics, calling themselves Scholars for Israel and Palestine (SIP) and claiming to be \\"pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace\\", asked the U.S. and EU to freeze Bennett's foreign assets and impose visa restrictions. Bennett was chosen as a target for proposed sanctions because of his work in opposing the 2010 settlement freeze while he was director of the Yesha settlements council, actively supporting annexation of over 60% of the West Bank, and \\"pressing strongly for a policy of creeping annexation.\\" In October 2016 Bennett said, \\"On the matter of the Land of Israel, we have to move from holding action to a decision. We have to mark the dream, and the dream is that Judea and Samaria will be part of the sovereign State of Israel. We have to act today, and we must give our lives. We can't keep marking the Land of Israel as a tactical target and a Palestinian state as the strategic target.\\" In November 2016 Bennett said the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States gave him hope that the two-state solution would no longer be considered viable, claiming, \\"The era of the Palestinian state is over.\\" = Economy and society = Bennett with President of Israel Reuven Rivlin, Michal Ansky, and Ofra Strauss at the Jasmine businesswomen's convention for promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, Israel, 15 December 2014 Bennett believes in less government regulation of the private sector and that private businesses are the engine of economic growth. He favors social support of vulnerable populations such as the elderly and disabled. Bennett has said Israel needs to break the monopoly of the tycoons, the major labor unions, and the Ministry of Defense, which are, in his opinion, strangling Israel's economy. He believes the key to reducing disparities is equality of opportunity and investment in education in the periphery, to give tools to populations of weaker economic backgrounds. By doing so, Bennett believes weaker populations in Israel will be given the opportunity to succeed professionally and financially. He supports the provision of land to veterans in the periphery, in the Negev, and the Galilee, to promote a national solution to the problem of \\"affordable housing\\"Matti Friedman: The new (secular) face of religious Zionism, Times of Israel, 26 December 2012 and a more equitable distribution of the population in Israel. He has also pledged to remove heavy bureaucratic challenges to small and medium-sized Israeli businesses. An adherent of Orthodox Judaism, Bennett opposes the implementation of same-sex marriage in Israel, \\"just as we don't recognize milk and meat together as kosher\\", but has expressed support for equivalent rights such as tax breaks for same-sex couples. As Economy Minister, Bennett oversaw a new strategy by Israel to increase trade with emerging markets around the world and reduce trade with the European Union, so as to diversify its foreign trade. The two main reasons for this shift are to take advantage of opportunities in emerging markets and to avert the threat of possible EU sanctions on Israel over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett acknowledged that he was seeking to reduce Israel's economic dependence on the EU to reduce its influence on Israel. According to the Financial Times, Bennett is the primary architect of this economic pivot. Under his leadership, the Economy Ministry began opening new trade attach√© offices in Asia, Africa, and South America, and also began closing some trade offices in Europe and consolidating others with offices in neighboring countries. As part of this process, Bennett opened negotiations with Russia and China on free trade agreements, oversaw continuing negotiations with India for a free trade agreement, and led economic delegations to China and India. While attending the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2013 in Bali, Indonesia, Bennett held talks with delegations from some unspecified countries on the possibility of future free trade agreements. Bennett also implemented reforms to lower Israel's high food prices. Under his oversight, import duties and barriers were reduced, and mechanisms were set up to ensure more competition in the Israeli food industry. These reforms have been credited with a decline in Israeli food prices that began in April 2014 and continued throughout the rest of the year and into 2015. According to a Haaretz editorial, however, a fall in global commodity prices and dire financial straits among many Israeli consumers prompted the decline, not the reforms. Bennett has led a push to integrate Haredi men and Israeli-Arab women, many of whom are unemployed, into the workforce. According to Bennett, their integration into the workforce will greatly bolster economic growth. Under his \\"voucher plan\\", the Ministry of the Economy issues vouchers for hundreds of vocational schools that will allow Haredi men to avoid mandatory military service, at least temporarily, in exchange for enrolling in a vocational school to learn a trade. Bennett has also greatly bolstered aid and government programs for Arab women to encourage more of them to enter the workforce, with the goal of doubling their employment rate from 25 to 50 percent in five years.

Biography Sayed Kashua was born in Tira in the Triangle region of Israel to Palestinian parents. In 1990, he was accepted to a prestigious boarding school in Jerusalem - Israel Arts and Science Academy. He studied sociology and philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Kashua was a resident of Beit Safafa before moving to a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem with his wife and children.Atlantic Books: Sayed Kashua = Departure from Israel = Kashua accepted teaching positions in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois and Chicago, moving there with his wife and three children for the 2014/15 academic year. His Haaretz column of July 4, titled \\"Why Sayed Kashua is Leaving Jerusalem and Never Coming Back: Everything people had told him since he was a teenager is coming true. Jewish-Arab co-existence has failed.\\" was published at a volatile time in the country's intergroup relations, involving the kidnapping/murders of Jewish students in the West Bank and an Arab youth in East Jerusalem, though prior to the July 8 outbreak of the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. His declaration elicited numerous responses in the Israeli press from colleagues and readers who were concerned by the issues he raises. Kashua‚Äôs concern for his family and despair at the Jewish-Israeli community‚Äôs continued rejection of Arab-Israelis despite his 25 years of writing motivated his move to the United States. In his Haaretz newspaper column, he wrote that ‚ÄúI‚Äôd lost my small war‚Äù and that he saw no hope of a world for his children where Arab- and Jewish-Israelis could coexist. Kashua began teaching at the University of Illinois through the Israeli Studies Project, a sponsorship program for Israeli writers and scholars run by Illinois and the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, and remained there as a Visiting Clinical Professor from 2014-2018. He participated in the Creative Writing program's bilingualism workshop at the University of Chicago and is a clinical professor in the Israel Studies program at the University of Illinois at Champaign-UrbanaJewish Culture and Society: Faculty Directory.In Summer 2018, Kashua and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, for Kashua to enroll in the Ph.D. Program of Comparative Literature at Washington University in St. Louis. There, he is also a Hebrew Instructor for the Department of Jewish, Islamic, and Near Eastern Languages & Cultures. Literary career Kashua‚Äôs exposure to literature began at the Israel Arts and Science Academy when he was 14 years old. Upon successfully reading his first novel in Hebrew, The Catcher in the Rye, Kashua discovered a passion for books. At this time, he began writing for the first time, primarily about the Arabic narrative in a Jewish country. Kashua wrote with the goal of creating a more equal Israel. His first novel, Dancing Arabs (2002), tells the story of a nameless Arab-Israeli attending an elite Jewish boarding school and code-switching between Arab and Jewish identities in an attempt to fit in. These semi-autobiographical themes of identity and in-betweenness, often packaged in the tragic comedy genre, become hallmarks of Kashua‚Äôs writing. Throughout the years, Kashua‚Äôs fiction often uses stereotypical characters ‚Äî caricatures of Jewish- and Arab-Israelis ‚Äî to both foster familiarity with his audience and subvert the perception of these identities in real life. From the beginning of his career as a writer, Kashua wrote exclusively in Hebrew despite having grown up speaking exclusively Arabic. This was an intentional choice on his part in reaction to the poor representation of Palestinian characters in Hebrew books at his school library; Kashua wanted to ‚Äútell the Israelis‚Ä¶the Palestinian story,‚Äù and he does this by using ‚Äúhumor, sarcasm, and absurdity to appeal to readers and utilizes popular media such as television and journalism.‚Äù His primary vehicle of communication was a personal weekly column in Hebrew for Haaretz and a local Jerusalem weekly, HaIr. In a humorous, tongue-in-cheek style, his column embedded political and social commentaries about problems faced by Arab- Israelis into anecdotes about parenting and day-to-day life. In one such piece, Kashua pondered one‚Äôs ability to truly integrate into a new culture while recounting mundane yet familiarly realistic conversations between family members. He uses the perspective of his children to highlight the absurdity of social norms, such as his daughter‚Äôs sad confession that she knows she will ‚Äúalways be an Arab‚Äù to the rest of Israeli society. By writing in Hebrew for a mainstream news platform, Kashua exposed a Jewish-Israeli audience to the Arab-Israeli experience. In his Haaretz article announcing his move to the United States, Kashua anticipated having to switch again to write in English ‚Äúabout a far-off land in which children are shot, slaughtered, buried and burned‚Äù even though ‚Äúthe readers will probably think I am a fantasy writer‚Äù since he did not think Hebrew speakers would care to read his work for much longer. While he did transition to having a greater English presence, beginning only two weeks later with an English article for The Guardian about his expatriation, he continued his Haaretz column and wrote his most recent novel, Track Changes, in Hebrew before publishing an English translation in 2020. Kashua ended his Haaretz column in November 2017, announcing his hiatus in a final column entitled ‚ÄúSayed Kashua Bids Adieu: The Perils of Being an Arab-Israeli Writer‚Äù that detailed his view of the role of a Palestinian writer and his hopes for Israel‚Äôs future. Today, Kashua continues to publish opinion pieces through various platforms, including The Guardian, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. Television Avoda Aravit (2007), or in English, Arab Labor, is a satirical sitcom written by Kashua and aired on Israel's Channel 2. A large part of the dialogue is in Arabic with Hebrew subtitles. The show is about a young Arab couple, Amjad (Norman Issa) and Bushra (Clara Khoury), and their young daughter, who live in an Arab village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Amjad is a journalist working for a Hebrew newspaper (much like Haaretz) who desperately seeks to assimilate into the prevailing Israeli Jewish cultural milieu with mixed and hilarious results. The show holds a mirror up to the racism and ignorance on both sides of the ethnic divide and has been compared with All in the Family. The show received overwhelmingly positive reviews, winning awards for Best Comedy, Best Lead Actor in a Comedy, Best Lead Actress in a Comedy, Best Director, and Best Screenplay at the 2013 Israeli Academy of Film and Television awards. In the auto-fictional drama The Writer (2015) draws Kateb on his own experiences for his depiction of the turbulent daily life of a young Arab and his family living in Israel. However, the more successful his satirical TV series becomes, the more Kateb feels alienated from his alter ego.http://www.keshetinternational.com/article/keshet-internationals-the- writer-chosen-as-one-of-six-premium-dramas-to-make-the-berlinale-special- selection-2016/ Filmography *Dancing Arabs (2014) A film adaptation of Kashua's second novel, Let It Be Morning, was slated to begin production in early 2017.

Early life and education Osi≈Ñski was born in Warsaw, Poland. His parents were Jan Osi≈Ñski and Maria Osi≈Ñska (family name Maruszewska). During high school, he founded the Sermonia literary club and joined the Polski Lotniczy ZwiƒÖzek M≈Çodzie≈ºy (\\"Polish Youth Aviation Association\\").\\"Osi≈Ñski Jerzy\\". Samoloty. He studied law at the Warsaw University Career As a young man, Osi≈Ñski was involved in competitive aviation. In 1931 and 1933 he competed in the Lublin - Podlasie Winter Air Races as a navigator. In 1936 he won the J. Keilowa balloon competition. On September 2, 1938, Osi≈Ñski joined the International Aeronautical Federation (F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale) (patent no. 58). Osi≈Ñski founded the M≈Çody Lotnik (Young Aviator) magazine whose first issue was published on 5 October 1924. After 10 July 1930, the magazine changed its name to Skrzydlata Polska (Winged Poland), and was issued until the outbreak of World War II. M≈Çody Lotnik was a popular magazine about flying while Skrzydlata Polska was more technical, and included reviews of international press about aviation. J. Osi≈Ñski was the publisher of Skrzydlata Polska between July 1934 and September 1939 (because of the war the September issue was not published and was destroyed). During the war, J. Osi≈Ñski fled via Zaleszczyki and Romania to Turkey. In Turkey, he became a manager of economic affairs of a factory producing aviation equipment and fighting planes for the Allies. After the war, Osi≈Ñski worked in the LOT Polish Airlines. In 1953, he was dismissed for political reasons: he never joined the Polish United Workers' Party. He could not find another job in his profession in a state enterprise due to the employment policy of that time, and he worked in Kazimierz Tukan co-operative. In 1956, after the political thaw (Gomulka Thaw), he was offered employment in LOT and in the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Communication. He became the department director but, being nonpartisan, he remained a low-level employee. Highly knowledgeable on the issues of aviation and air transport, he participated in preparing Polish documentation and the guidelines of development in the ministry, and was responsible for international contacts within the Council for Mutual Economic Aid (Comecon). Osi≈Ñski was a member and supporter of the Solidarity movement. During the Martial law in Poland in 1981, he refused to sign the ‚Äúlojalka‚Äù, the \\"declaration of loyalty\\" (:pl:deklaracja lojalno≈õci) about refraining from any actions against the contemporary state administration, and was subsequently dismissed again. At this point in his life he started suffering from cancer. Retirement After retirement, he continued to work as a consultant in the Ministry department dealing with international relations, and economical issues. Also, he was once more an editor of Skrzydlata Polska, where he regularly published reviews of international press about aviation. Osi≈Ñski was an active member of the Aviation Seniors' Club and the Warsaw Aviation Club (\\"Aeroklub Warszawski\\"). He was the author of the Aviation Transport handbook. Osi≈Ñski was married to Zofia Osi≈Ñska (family name Melcer). He had one daughter El≈ºbieta (at present El≈ºbieta Dryll).

Garden State Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2002. The confluence of the Cooper River with the Delaware River is in Camden. The Cooper River serves as a border between Cherry Hill and Haddon Township, Haddonfield, and Lawnside. The Cooper River (known upstream near Haddonfield as Cooper's Creek) was named after the Cooper family, who were some of the first European settlers in the area of Camden County, New Jersey. This tributary of the Delaware River is 16 miles (25.7 km) long measuring from its headwater in Gibbsboro (it is notable that the Northern Branch begins in Voorhees Township). The Cooper River Watershed covers , and includes the tributaries Chandlers Run, Millard Creek, Nicholson Branch, the North Branch, and Tindale Run (the last two being the most significant). Although historically a tidal river (the most severe tide reportedly reached Kings Highway), all present tidal influence stops at the Kaighn Avenue Bridge, in Camden, where it is impounded. The Cooper flows through Barrington, Berlin Township, Camden, Cherry Hill, Collingswood, Gibbsboro, Haddon Township, Haddonfield, Lawnside, Lindenwold, Magnolia, Merchantville, Pennsauken Township, Somerdale, Stratford, Tavistock and Voorhees Township.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Copper River Park Historic District, National Park Service. Accessed December 28, 2017. \\"The Cooper River flows through the following Camden County municipalities: Barrington, Berlin, Camden, Cherry Hill,. Collingswood, Gibbsboro, Haddon Township, Haddonfield, Lawnside, Lindenwold, Magnolia, Merchantville, Pennsauken Township,. Somerdale, Stratford, Tavistock, and Voorhees.\\" The Cooper also has seven impoundments, not listed in geographical order: Cooper River Lake, Evans Pond, Hopkins Pond, Kirkwood Lake, Linden Lake, Square Circle Lake, Wallworth Lake. Historical reference Benjamin Franklin made a brief visit to Cooper's Creek on his way to Philadelphia, as a run-away apprentice from Boston in 1723: \\"However, walking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and arrived there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and landed at the Market-street wharf.\\" Recreation The Camden County Boathouse sits on the banks of the Cooper River in Pennsauken Township and is home to eight area rowing clubs, which are active February through November. The Cooper River Yacht Club is situated on the Cooper River in Collingswood and offers sailing instruction courses during the summer to children and adults, as well as organizing racing events from time to time. Using a canoe, people can navigate the Cooper from its mouth to southern Haddonfield; however, it is necessary to cross several impoundments. Canoeing the Cooper into and farther than Greenwald Park in Cherry Hill is technically a violation of local watercraft laws. Fishing in the river has improved since the installation of fish ladders along the impoundments. In season, small fish such as sunnies and smallmouth bass can be caught. Sports Since 1955, the Cooper River has been the site of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association's IRA Championship Regatta, which is considered to be the United States collegiate national championship of rowing. The 2007 Scholastic Rowing Association of America national championships and USRowing club national championships were held on the Cooper River. The trail around the river regularly hosts community races such as the 9/11 Heroes Run hosted by the Travis Manion Foundation.

With a history going back to the 12th century, it was once a rural municipality in the former Kristianstad County. It lies on the eastern bank of Iv√∂ Lake, between Iv√∂ and the smaller lake Levrasj√∂n. The Ivetofta Local Historical Society was founded in 1981 and as of 2013 has nearly 500 members. Geography The village is located between Iv√∂sj√∂n and Han√∂bukten, and consists of the forested Ryssberget hill and sandy plains which are cultivated. The habitats are characterised as pine forest, deciduous forest, meadow, pasture, and grassy heath. History The name is first documented in 1319 as Yw√§toffte. It stems from the old name Iv√∂sj√∂n, the Iv√∂ Lake, and \\"toft\\" meaning farm. Brom√∂lla, of which Ivetofta is a suburb, came to be established initially as a borough when limestone was found nearby, and later became a municipality. The origin of its name is attributed to a mill named Brom√∂lla which existed on the bank of the Skr√§be River and is dated to the 1460s. A ceramic vessel discovered at Ivetofta attests to pre-historic hunter- gatherers who pre-dated farming here. Palaeontological finds include Plesiosaurian bone fragments which were provided to the Palaeontological Institute of Lund in 1961 from a borehole, while archaeology has uncovered cremation urns from pits estimated as Late Bronze Age. Landmarks Ivetofta Church was probably built in the 12th century; the tower (built in stone and decorated with carved sandstone) on the western side was added in the 13th century. The altar, pulpit, pews and the baptismal font were donated by Sophia Brahe in the early 17th century, who had moved to the area with her second husband and was known for her work in Danish genealogy. These features have been retained in the renovated church. Brahe had planned on being buried there but returned to her native Denmark, settling in Helsing√∏r before she died. Her planned headstone is on display at Ivetofta church.\\"Ivetofta kirke, Sk√•ne. Gravsten. Sl√¶gtstavle for Sophia Brahe\\", Gravsten og epitafier. Retrieved 26 June 2013.

The old nave and chancel were demolished, and a wider church room with cross arms and a three sided chancel were built by the architect C.G. Brunius. The nave was extended to form two arms of the cross. Major external renovation work was carried out in 2012, which retained features added by Brahe.

History  The Henge of Keltria began organizing in 1988 as a \\"breakaway\\" organization from √År nDra√≠ocht F√©in (ADF) with initial groves in Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Texas. The bylaws of the organization divide the Order into two major divisions. First is a secular organization consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and three ad hoc trustees. This Board of Trustees is responsible for all operational activities of the organization. The second division is a religious order consisting of an Elected Archdruid and elected Elders who comprise the Council of Elders which provides the theological direction for the church and maintains religious standards throughout the Order. The Henge registered with the state of Minnesota as a non-profit corporation in 1995 and received its 501(c)(3) determination letter from the IRS in 2005. By 1989, it began publication of a quarterly newsletter, \\"Henge Happenings,\\" for its membership. Also in 1989, the HoK began publishing Keltria: Journal of Druidism and Celtic Magick as a publicly available journal. Keltria Journal is more article driven and less newsy than the newsletter. Keltria Journal ceased publication in 1998 after 39 issues and took a 13 year hiatus. Publication of the Keltria Journal began again in 2012. As of 31 Oct 2017 The Henge corporation was officially dissolved and new membership is no longer being accepted. . However, there are still some Initiates that will mentor the Keltrian Way upon request, and the Book of Keltria is a wonderful resource for seekers.  Principal Beliefs  The Keltrian Druid practice recognizes three levels of experience: Ring of the Birch, Ring of the Yew, and Ring of the Oak. It also promotes three areas of service: Bardic service, Seer's service, and the Druid's service. The three foundations of Keltrian Druidism: Belief is secondary in Keltrian Druidism. Actions and practice determine the path that an individual is on. The goal of Keltrian Druidism is to develop a spiritual relationship with the Ancestors, Nature Spirits, and Gods and Goddesses in a Celtic context.

It was established in 1844 in Munkedamsveien in Christiania. The institution was relocated to Ullensaker in 1858, and again to the island of Helg√∏ya in 1876. The institution closed in 1947. History The institution was established by wholesaler and former mayor of Christiania Andreas Tofte in 1844, as a \\"rescuing institution for morally corrupt children of both sexes\\". It was originally located at Munkedamsveien 31 in Christiania, at Holmen in Pipervika. In 1847 the institution, including seven buildings, was donated to the municipality of Christiania. The donation was accepted on 9 June 1847, and the institution was henceforth called Toftes Gave (Tofte's gift), named after the donor. In 1858 it was moved to Risebro farm in Ullensaker. In 1876 it was decided to relocate the institution again to Nedre Sund farm on the island of Helg√∏ya in Lake Mj√∏sa, in Hedmark. The moving process took place during the autumn of 1877. According to new regulations adopted in 1878, from then on the institution only accepted boys. While the clientele consisted of 58 boys in 1888, this increased to 151 boys in 1899. The number was reduced to 86 boys in 1912. In 1912 the farm's livestock counted 78 cattle, 14 horses and 65 pigs. After decades of cultivation the farmland consisted of about 900 decares of arable land and 400 decares of productive forests. From this period the institution is known among others through the memoirs of Johannes S. Andersen. He spent four years at Toftes Gave, beginning when he was ten years old, and describes a regime of strict discipline. The children were used as farm workers, under the surveillance of local farmers from Helg√∏ya, and he had the impression they were regarded as inferior to the most primitive of animals. The children adapted to the regime in order to survive. Their instincts of self-preservation also made them learn how to make picklocks to gain access to storages of potatoes or turnips, in order to appease their hunger. Essentially they learned two things at the institution: hatred of all kinds of oppression and tyranny, and solidarity against what he called slave-drivers and executioners.Andersen 1946, p. 51 From 1896 Toftes Gave was run by the State of Norway, until it closed in 1947. =Later use= From 1951 the location at Helg√∏ya was used by the municipality of Oslo as a home for mentally disabled persons. The site was transferred to the municipality of Ringsaker in 1991.

The song was released as a single from the band's third and final studio album, Special Beat Service, finding moderate chart success in Britain. Written by Beat guitarist Dave Wakeling before the band was founded, the song nearly went unreleased due to opposition from bassist David Steele. After pressure from Wakeling and the record company, the song was ultimately recorded for the band's third album. The song has since become one of the band's most famous tracks and has been featured in various soundtracks and compilation albums. \\"Save It for Later\\" is also notable for its unique tuning, which was achieved accidentally. The track's lyrics highlight the suggestive double-entendre of the song's title. Background \\"Save It for Later\\" was written by Beat guitarist Dave Wakeling as a teenager before the founding of the band. The song was then attempted at band rehearsals. Although Wakeling said he \\"always liked the song before [he] was in the group,\\" the song was initially rejected by bassist David Steele for \\"being too 'rock,' too 'old wave. By the time of the band's third album, however, Steele had been unable to provide enough material and the record company began pressuring the band to record \\"Save It for Later\\". Wakeling recalled, \\"It was only really when the record company insisted [on releasing the track], and I got a bit of courage and said, 'Well, look, if it‚Äôs not on our record I‚Äôd just rather go and record it myself and bring it out. Steele continued to refuse to play on the backing track, leading Wakeling and drummer Everett Morton to record a basic track until the rest of the band relented. Music and lyrics \\"Save It for Later\\" features a unique DADAAD tuning that Wakeling stumbled upon; he explained, \\"I had tried to tune my guitar to DADGAD to play along with Jon (sic) Martyn tunes in late 70's before The English Beat started. I accidentally came up with DADAAD, so I made up my own chord shapes and enjoyed the hypnotic drone of the tuning on my national steel for hour after hour.\\" Due to the song's atypical tuning, Who guitarist Pete Townshend called Wakeling to ask how to play the song: Wakeling described the lyrical theme of \\"Save It for Later\\" as \\"about turning from a teenager to someone in their 20s.\\" The title of the song also served as a double-entendre‚ÄîWakeling explained, \\"It started off as a dirty schoolboy joke. The phrase 'save it for later' is meant to be 'save it,' comma, 'fellator.'\\" Release and reception \\"Save It for Later\\" was released on Special Beat Service in 1982. The song also saw release as a single, reaching number 47 in the British charts.. In the US, along with the track, \\"Sole Salvation\\", \\"Save It for Later\\" went to number 58 on the Billboard Dance/Disco Top 80 chart. \\"Save It for Later\\" remains one of the Beat's most acclaimed songs. Wakeling acknowledged the song's success, saying, \\"[The track] actually ended up earning about a third of our catalogue's publishing money, nowadays.\\" According to Wakeling, Pete Townshend (who covered the song on multiple occasions) described the song as \\"one of [his] favorite songs in [his] whole life.\\" Counting Crows singer Adam Duritz named it his perfect summer song, saying, \\"There's just something about the joy of the song ... It just seems so Technicolor to me.\\" Pearl Jam regularly performs the song live in a medley with their song \\"Better Man.\\" The track has appeared in Kingpin, Hot Tub Time Machine, Funny People, Sky High, Since You've Been Gone, 200 Cigarettes (performed by Seattle alternative rock band Harvey Danger), the Season 1 finale of Love and Spider-Man: Homecoming as performed by Pete Townshend, Once Upon a Time in the episode Wake Up Call and Like Father.

It is the second single malt whisky to be made in India (the first being Solan No. 1) Amrut (‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§) or amrita is a Sanskrit word which can be translated as \\"nectar of the gods\\", \\"nectar of life\\", or \\"drink of the gods\\". The company translates it as \\"Elixir of Life\\". The brand became famous after whisky connoisseur Jim Murray gave it a rating of 82 out of 100 in 2005 and 2010. In 2010 Murray named Amrut Fusion single malt whisky as the third best in the world. John Hansell, editor of American magazine Whisky Advocate, wrote that \\"India's Amrut distillery changed the way many think of Indian whisky ‚Äì that it was, in the past, just cheap Scotch whisky blended with who knows what and sold as Indian whisky. Amrut is making whisky, and it's very good\\". Amrut launched their whisky on 24 August 2004 in Glasgow. Amrut single malt whisky is sold in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. History Amrut Distilleries Ltd was founded in Bangalore, Karnataka in 1948 by JN Radhakrishna Rao Jagdale. The company initially manufactured Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), and mainly supplied it to the Canteen Stores Department, as well the states of Karnataka and Kerala. The current main distillery was built in 1987. It is located on a site in Kambipura. Radhakrishna Jagdale's son Neelakanta Rao Jagdale, joined in 1972. Radhakrishna died in 1976, and his son assumed the role of chairman and managing director of the company. The company faced difficulties until the 1990s, as good equipment was not available locally. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \\"The alcoholic beverages industry was not a priority in the country. Although we received help to a certain extent from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) Mysore, we had to find our own ways to learn about improved distilling methods\\". In 1982, Jagdale had decided to create a premium whisky from barley blended with malt, while most distillers in India were manufacturing whisky using molasses. Amrut Distilleries began using locally grown barley, in addition to molasses, and launched Prestige Blended Malt Whisky in the Canteen Stores Department in 1986. The first batch of single malt whisky was ready within 18 months. Because India had no culture of consuming single malt at the time, the company did not consider bottling it as a single malt. Instead, the whisky was blended with alcohol distilled from sugarcane to produce MaQintosh Premium Whisky. Initially, Amrut aged malt whisky for around a year before blending it. However, due to changing customer preferences, less malt whisky was being added into blended variants. The company discovered that hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during ageing, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 11‚Äì12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that one year of barrel-ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland. Jagdale felt that \\"the taste profiles were much better, almost matching some of the 12-year-old [Scotch] whiskies\\". The company then decided to launch their whisky in the European market. In 2001, Neelakanta Rao Jagdale asked his son Rakshit Jagdale, who was pursuing an MBA course in Newcastle, England at the time, to investigate the potential of exporting their products to that country. Consultants Tatlock and Thomson Ltd of Scotland were hired to help hone the company's processes at their Bangalore distillery. Amrut Distilleries conducted blind tests of their single malt whisky in Scotland, where most consumers said they liked the drink and compared it to Speyside single malts. The whisky, under the brand name Amrut Single Malt Whisky, debuted in Glasgow, Scotland on 24 August 2004. The company faced difficulties convincing European distributors and consumers to try the product, as most believed that a good single malt could not be produced in India. According to head of international operations Ashok Chokalingam, the initial strategy of offering the product in restaurants was dropped, as \\"the resources needed are too high, both financial and human\\". They switched their focus to retailers and bars. Following the UK launch, the brand spread across Western Europe and the Scandinavian countries within two years. Amrut single malt whisky was launched in South Africa in 2008 and Australia in August 2009. On 4 February 2010, Amrut Distilleries held a tasting session in Bangalore to launch their single malt whisky. The brand began retailing in Bangalore the same month. Domestically, it continued to be available only in Karnataka until November 2013 when it was launched in Mumbai.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/amrut-fusion-bengaluru- whisky-one-of-the-worlds-best-single-malts/articleshow/34465402.cms The company went with a Scottish launch for marketing reasons. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \\"From a marketing perspective, we thought if our product had to pass the test, why not do so in the toughest location. Scotland is the home of Scotch. If they acknowledge our single malt, then that's good enough for me\\". The company also feels that \\"the high entry costs and complex excise laws in different states are a deterrent to further expansion in India\\". The brand was launched in North America in April 2010. Purple Valley Imports is its distributor in the United States. Production Amrut single malt whisky is manufactured at Amrut Distilleries' main distillery located on a site in Kambipura, a village on State Highway 17. The distillery was built in 1987. Amrut single malt whisky is made from barley, and for some variants, peated barley. Barley is procured from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, while the peated barley is imported from Scotland. Peat is a fossil fuel traditionally used in Scotland to dry malted barley before distillation. It imparts a distinct smoky flavor to whisky. Barley strains, cultivated in Haryana and Punjab, produce smaller grains with more flavors. The manufacturing process involves the use of six 10,000-litre stainless steel fermenters, two unique conical 5,000-litre copper Pot stills with copper condensers and new and used ex-Bourbon barrels. The water used in the manufacturing process is transported to the distillery by truck from a well, away, in a pesticide-free agricultural area owned by the company. Malted barley is mashed with water and put into the stainless steel fermenters, which are water-cooled to prevent their temperature from exceeding , as Lactobacillus bacterial growth starts at . The fermentation process lasts six days and uses commercial distillers yeast. The fermented wort is then pumped into a 5,000-litre Indian-made semi-conical wash still, where it undergoes slow distillation for 14 hours. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, says that this allows for \\"more reflux, more contact time with the copper\\". The spirit is then distilled again in Scottish-style, but Indian-made, 5,000-litre copper spirit still with a boil ball. This produces spirit between 68% and 70% abv. If the spirit is diluted to 62.8%, each distillation run makes enough to fill 20 barrels. The whisky is aged in a mix of new oak and used Bourbon barrels imported from the United States. The distillery initially tried importing staves to save money, but abandoned the practice due to the smell of the barrels. It has also used its own rum and brandy barrels to finish its single malts. The Amrut Intermediate Sherry variant is aged in Sherry casks from Spain and Portugal. Amrut Distilleries has a cooperage on site to handle repairs. The duration of barrel-ageing for Amrut single malt whisky is much lower than that of Scotch whisky, due to India's hotter climate. The hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that one year of barrel-ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland. The whisky is generally aged for four-and-a-half years, although it may be higher for some variants. Bangalore, where the distillery is located, experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The city is situated at an altitude of 3000 feet above sea level and usually enjoys a moderate climate throughout the year. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 12 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 34‚Äì35 ¬∞C (<100 ¬∞F). As a result of these conditions, whisky is ready to be bottled after 4‚Äì5 years of barrel-ageing. According to Kumar, the whisky starts \\"reaching its peak in four years\\", after which it has to be tasted regularly because \\"by five years it starts to get too much tannin\\". The fraction lost to evaporation during aging, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 11‚Äì12% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. Most of the angel's share is water due to Bangalore's dry climate. The company decided against using computers and automation in their distillery in favour of providing more jobs to people. The distillery employs 450 people. Most of the staff at the distillery involved in bottling and packaging are women. The distillery produces 4 million cases of liquor a year, of which about 25% are blended whisky and around 10,000 cases are Amrut single malt. Variants Amrut single malt whisky is sold in 11 variants. Apart from the ones listed below, Amrut whisky is also sold in the Amrut Indian Single Malt Whisky 46%, Amrut Peated Indian Single Malt Whisky 46%, Amrut Cask Strength, Amrut Peated Indian Single Malt Whisky Cask Strength, Amrut Portonova, Amrut Single Cask and Amrut 100 variants.\\"Products\\", Amrut Distilleries (website). Retrieved 22 June 2013. Amrut Distilleries does not state the age of its single malts on the bottles because the company fears that consumers who do not know about the brand or the faster maturation process in India, would mistake it for a young whisky, and not be willing to pay a higher price. =Amrut Fusion Single Malt Whisky= A 50ml bottle of Amrut Fusion. Amrut Fusion was launched in 2009. It is produced using 25% Scottish peated barley and 75% unpeated Indian barley. According to Neelkanta Jagdale, \\"We did not want to pass it off as Scotch whisky, which it isn't. The USP of Fusion was its Indian origin. That is another reason we never seriously considered giving it a foreign name\\". =Amrut Intermediate Sherry= Amrut Intermediate Sherry was launched at Whisky Live Paris on 25 September 2010.. The spirit used in the product is matured in either ex-Bourbon or new casks, and then in Sherry casks imported from Spain and Portugal. According to head of international operations Ashok Chokalingam, \\"In our belief, it is not all about the influence of Sherry in the whisky. It is about the balanced profile of the whisky ‚Äì to see how the Sherry butts can complement the whisky rather than dominating it\\". =Amrut Kadhambam= Amrut Kadhambam is aged in various casks, which each impart unique characteristics to the product. =Limited editions= Amrut Two Continents Single Malt Whisky Amrut releases a limited edition of the Two Continents variant, usually every two or three years. The Second Edition used second-fill Bourbon casks and was bottled at 50% abv, while the First Edition was matured in ex-grain casks and bottled 46% abv. The Second Edition of 1,260 was released in October 2011. Amrut Greedy Angels Amrut Greedy Angels was a limited edition 50% abv, 8-year-old single malt whisky released in April 2013. Amrut Distilleries claims that it is the oldest Indian whisky ever produced. Its name comes from the term angels' share, the portion of whisky lost during maturation. The eight-year maturation in Bangalore resulted in a high evaporative loss of 12% per annum, or a total loss of 274 litres of spirit over eight years, from the two Bourbon casks the distillery had used. When filled in 2004, the casks held approximately 360 litres of spirit. Only 144 bottles or 86 litres of whisky were released worldwide. Greedy Angels was dedicated to celebrate the 60th birthday of Amrut Distilleries chairman and MD, Neelakanta Jagdale. Amrut Double Cask Amrut Double Cask was a limited edition of 51 cases released in March 2010.

Harding Luther Lawrence (July 15, 1920 ‚Äì January 16, 2002) was the former Executive Vice President of Continental Airlines and then President and Chairman of Braniff International Airways, a Dallas, Texas-based carrier. Lawrence's bold and dramatic accomplishments at both airlines earned him the reputation as not only a maverick of the transportation industry but as one of the last legendary titans of aviation. While at Braniff, Lawrence turned the conservative airline into a progressive and flamboyant carrier known for high fashion flight attendant uniforms, exemplary inflight service, and brightly painted planes. Lawrence' revolutionary approach included approving the \\"End of the Plain Plane\\" campaign in 1965, which called for imaginative aircraft paint schemes, interiors, and never before seen passenger service comforts. Previous airlines were commonly patterned after less than appealing military operations. Early years He was born in Oklahoma and grew up in Gladewater, Texas. His father, Muncey Luther Lawrence (November 15, 1888 ‚Äì March 12, 1954) was a school teacher and a Christian church minister in Perkins, Oklahoma and Gladewater. His mother, Helen Beatrice Langley Lawrence (December 6, 1897 ‚Äì November 23, 1968) managed the Gladwater Hotel. Lawrence was very close to both of his parents and looked after them throughout their lives. Even with Lawrence's great success it was beyond his ability to get his mother to retire and move into a new luxurious home he had built for her in Dallas. She operated the hotel until her death in the late 1960s. Education and military service Lawrence attended Gladewater High School, graduating two years early, but with a less-than-stellar academic record. He then attended Kilgore Junior College, where his grades earned him membership in an academic honors group. Lawrence was hired in 1940 by Dallas Aviation School, where he became Director of Flying. The school was founded by Major William F. Long, who would employ Lawrence in two additional aviation positions after his wartime service. Lawrence also attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1942. He served in the US Army Air Corps for two years during World War II, training with the RAAF in Dallas, Texas, and Toronto, Canada, and with LAAF at Sheppard Field and Bryan, Texas. He served in Toronto and at the LAAF Base Unit in Lemoore, California. Lawrence married Jimmie George Bland of Greenville, Texas, in 1942. They had three sons and one daughter during their marriage. The couple divorced in 1966. British Flying Training School The No. 1 British Flying Training School in Terrell, Texas, hired Lawrence in 1942. Major William F. Long, founder of Dallas Aviation School, also founded the Terrell RAF Cadet School in 1940. The US had just entered World War II and the civilian school procured a government contract to train British pilots. Lawrence's duties included that of Link Trainer instructor. His abilities were quickly noticed, and he was subsequently promoted to supervise the school's maintenance department. Mr. Lawrence was promoted to Director of the school. He remained with the school until 1944, and then spent two years on active duty with the US Air Force. The No. 1 British Flying Training School Museum, Inc., is dedicated to the preservation of the school's history. On July 23, 2017, a Braniff Trail Historical Plaque was dedicated at the No. 1 British Flying Training School Museum to honor Harding Lawrence's earliest aviation job. The plaque is one of over 30 that will be placed around the world at locations that were important to the history of Braniff Airways. Essair and Pioneer Airlines After his release from the military, a flight school administrator from Terrell, Texas offered him a job in 1946 with Essair Airways, a small commuter carrier based in Houston, Texas, which was also founded by Major Long. Essair would eventually become Pioneer Airlines and then merge with Continental Airlines on April 1, 1955. While in Houston, Lawrence attended South Texas College of Law and received his LLB in 1949. He attended school at night while working at Pioneer during the day.  Continental Airlines  The merger with Continental put Lawrence directly under the mentoring of Continental founder and President Robert Six. the CEO of Continental for 45 years from 1936 until 1981. Under his tutelage. Lawrence honed his airline administration skills. Six was quoted as saying \\"one of the biggest reasons we merged with Pioneer was to get Harding.\\" Lawrence, at the time of the merger in 1955, was made Continental's Vice President of Traffic. He was elevated to Executive Vice President in 1958 remaining in this position until 1965, when he became President of Braniff International. During his ten-year tenure at Continental the airline grew by 500 percent.  Braniff International Airways  In early 1965, Lawrence was seen throughout the Braniff International operation at Dallas Love Field. He had pen and paper in hand and appeared to be watching the bustling Braniff schedule with a keen intensity and specific interest, writing down everything that he saw. Everyone wondered who this was and what was his interest in Braniff. Braniff employees would soon find out he was their new President, hired by insurance magnate Troy V. Post, Chairman of Greatamerica Corporation, to turn Braniff into a world class global airline. Braniff co-founder Thomas Elmer Braniff was an insurance magnate and now the third major owner (Senator William A. Blakley was the second largest owner of Braniff after 1954) of Braniff was also an insurance executive. Lawrence engineered a remarkable airline overhaul during his 16 years with Braniff International Airways. He retired on December 31, 1980, after a long battle to save Braniff from bankruptcy due to the competitive pressure of deregulation combined with a national economic downturn and unprecedented rises in fuel costs. During his first month at Braniff, Lawrence executed an order for 12 new Boeing 727 aircraft, The aircraft had already been selected before his arrival but not yet ordered. These airplanes were the C model with a large freight loading door at the front of the aircraft, which allowed Braniff to begin late night cargo service while during the day regular passenger service was operated with the aircraft, doubling the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business that was called AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a cargo/passenger configuration, if needed. The 727 would become the backbone of the Braniff Fleet and the key aircraft in its 1971 Fleet Standardization Plan that called for only three aircraft types: Boeing 727 on domestic service, 747 for Hawaii, and DC-8 for South America. When Lawrence took office in May, 1965, Braniff operated thirteen different aircraft types. Lawrence also increased daily utilization of its aircraft which increased revenue without adding more aircraft to the fleet. Throughout Lawrence's tenure Braniff achieved record revenues, profits and traffic as detailed in month after month of Braniff B Liner Employee Newsletters, financial statements, and company annual reports. Under Lawrence's administration Braniff business volume grew from 100 million USD in 1965 to over 1.5 billion USD in 1980 and nearly doubled its passenger market share. Even during 1980 Braniff continued to set record traffic levels and revenues. Lawrence was bold with his management of Braniff even attempting to take over the much larger Pan American World Airways, Inc. in the early 1970s, which would have served the dual purpose of making Braniff a worldwide air carrier and giving Pan Am access to a United States domestic feeder system. Pan Am's Chairman Najeeb Halaby unfortunately refused the idea, preferring to pursue a merger with international competitor Trans World Airlines.  Retirement and final years  In retirement Lawrence consulted for Pan Am at the request of his former associate C. Edward Acker in the early 1980s. (Ed Acker was Executive Vice President and President of Braniff from 1965 until 1975 and became Chairman of Pan Am in 1981.) During the 1980s, Lawrence worked at Wells Rich Greene advertising agency alongside his wife, advertising legend Mary Wells Lawrence who Lawrence married in November, 1967. Mary Wells Lawrence sold her advertising firm Wells Rich Greene in 1990. The Lawrence's enjoyed retirement throughout the 1990s and bought and sold real estate as a side line. On September 22, 2001, Lawrence returned to his hometown of Perkins, Oklahoma, to act as grand marshal of the annual Old Settler's Fall Harvest. The theme for the 2001 Harvest was \\"Pioneers of Transportation\\" with Lawrence as the honored guest. The Perkins City Commission declared the Saturday event as \\"Harding L. Lawrence Day\\" and recognized Lawrence for his contributions to the airline industry.

History Trade union organisation on the Rhodesian railways had its origins in World War I, when the shortage of labour due to war service increased the bargaining power of the workers. In 1916 firemen at Bulawayo went on strike and their demands were met. In October of the following year the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union was formed, representing engineers and firemen. The union spread throughout the Rhodesian Railways network, including Northern Rhodesia. A prominent early leader of the union was Jack Keller, a Scottish- born railway worker who emigrated to Rhodesia after participating in the failed 1911 railway strike in Britain. The RRWU's first strike, in February 1919, was successful. It was followed in March 1920 by a larger strike, supported by the unions representing European postal workers and miners, which was even more successful. It resulted in a 25 per cent increase in railway workers' pay and secured an eight-hour day. The RRWU soon became involved in Rhodesian politics and opposed moves to integrate the Rhodesian colonies with the Union of South Africa, instead favouring Responsible Government for the European population. This stance was partly motivated by the anti-labour policies of the South African government, including the repression of the Rand Rebellion. In 1923 the union was centrally involved in the establishment of the Rhodesian Labour Party, with a significant majority of Labour MPs being railwaymen, with Keller himself being elected into parliament. The RRWU was also the largest donor to the party. Throughout its history the Rhodesian Labour Party vote would be strongest in those areas with significant populations of railway workers, including Bulawayo and Broken Hill. The strength of the RRWU peaked in the 1920s, and declined towards the end of the decade as the Railway administration sought to undermine the union. This culminated in a major strike in February 1929, called by the union in an attempt to reassert its influence. The government responded dramatically, commandeering all motor vehicles to maintain communications and calling up a paramilitary force of European citizens. The 1929 strike ended in defeat for the union, which continued to exist throughout Rhodesia's history, but never regained the militancy and strength of the early 1920s. The strength of industrial organization amongst the white working class in Rhodesia, as well as the government's concern to retain the support of European workers against the African population, has been credited with maintaining pay and conditions for white workers in Rhodesia at levels much higher than among comparable workers in Britain or Europe. The Colour Bar The RRWU represented only European rail workers, the black African workers being represented by the Rhodesia Railways African Employees' Union (RRAEU) in Southern Rhodesia and the African Railway Workers' Trade Union (ARTWU) in Northern Rhodesia. These amalgamated in July 1955 to form the Railway African Workers' Union. Throughout its history the RRWU resisted the expansion of the role of African workers on the railways, particularly the employment of African workers in skilled positions. This exclusionary hiring policy was known as the 'Industrial Colour Bar'. The RRWU maintained that their opposition was only to the employment of African workers on wages and conditions below that of the European workers, which they argued would undermine conditions for the European workers and lead to the exploitation of the African employees.

It reopened in 1980 at its present location at 1469 Huai Hai Zhong Road (at the corner with Urumqi Road) in an early 20th-century mansion. The Consulate General has two other offices in Shanghai.

The Consulate General is among the oldest American diplomatic and consular posts in the Far East, and the second oldest in China.History  U.S Embassy & Consulates in China =Establishment= Boundary Stone of the American Settlement in Shanghai. The first American consular presence in Shanghai dates to the mid- nineteenth century, following the conclusion of the Treaty of Wanghia, a treaty of \\"peace, amity, and commerce\\", between the United States and the Qing Dynasty in 1844. In the absence of an officially appointed consul, American businessman Henry Wolcott ‚Äî local agent for a Boston trading company ‚Äî raised the Stars and Stripes above his company office near the Bund and became the first Acting U.S. Consul in Shanghai. In 1854, in recognition of growing American trade and interests in the port city, the United States Government appointed Robert Murphy the first professional American Consul in Shanghai. His offices were located on Whangpoo Road (now Huangpu Road), north of Suzhou Creek, in the area that would soon become the hub of Shanghai‚Äôs American Settlement. As Shanghai‚Äôs linkages with the West grew, so too did the American Consulate. =Growth in the 19th Century= US Consulate General, Shanghai, 1880 President Abraham Lincoln named George Seward to be Consul in 1861 and promoted him to Consul General two years later. He served in that position until 1876 when he was appointed US Minister to China. During his fifteen years in Shanghai, Seward oversaw the expansion of the American Settlement and its merger with the British Settlement and French Concession, creating a joint International Settlement.

In 1874, Seward signed a lease for a consular compound to be built with its main entrance off Woochang Road (now Wuchang Road) and on the banks of the Huangpu River. In 1885, the land was sold and the new owners terminated the lease with effect from 1 February 1889. The consulate moved to new buildings at 12 Kiukiang Road (Jiujiang Road) in what was traditionally considered the British Concession. =The Early Twentieth Century= American Consulate General, Shanghai 1907 In 1901, the consulate returned to Hongkew, when Consul General John Goodnow agreed a ten-year lease to take over the old Club de Recrio building at 36 Whangpoo Road on a block away from the previous premises leased by Seward.The Consul General's Shanghai Postal Agency 1867-1907, Peter L Koffsky, pp39 et seq By the early twentieth century, more than 1,500 Americans called Shanghai home.

The German Consulate had been located there since 1937 and throughout the war. Post-war Shanghai was a different city; the foreign settlements had been abolished by the Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China and civil war between the Kuomintang government and Chinese Communists soon engulfed the country. On May 29, 1949, the People‚Äôs Liberation Army entered Shanghai. The new Communist government did not recognize the diplomatic status of the Consulate staff, and on April 25, 1950, Consul General Walter McConaughy lowered the American flag and closed the consulate.Time Magazine, May 15, 1950 It was not until decades later that formal diplomatic relations between China and the United States were reestablished, and the consulate could reopen. =Rebirth and Renewal= Shanghai itself came to symbolize the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations in 1972, with the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqu√©. On April 28, 1980, almost exactly 30 years after it closed, the United States Consulate General in Shanghai reopened at its present location at 1469 Central Huaihai Road (at the corner of Urumqi Road). A member of the old Consulate‚Äôs Chinese staff later presented Consul General Donald Anderson with the same flag that his predecessor had lowered three decades earlier. It now hangs in the consulate‚Äôs reception rooms as a symbol of the historic ties between the old Consulate and the new. Main building of the current US Consulate in Shanghai The current Consulate property was built in 1921. The main house is a villa in the French Renaissance style. Prior to the Consulate assuming the lease, the property hosted numerous and varied occupants. The first was Jardine, Matheson and Co., the largest British trading firm in Asia at the time. During World War II, a Japanese businessman and his family, and later the Swiss Consul General, took up residence in the house. In 1946, Rong Hongyuan (Yung Hungyuen), scion of a wealthy textile family, bought the property, but fled Shanghai soon after. Following the establishment of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the house was used by the All-China Women‚Äôs Federation, was a center for \\"political education\\" during The Cultural Revolution, and finally served as a government guesthouse prior to the U.S. Consulate taking the lease. The present Consulate property sits on three acres, and includes several outbuildings, an orange grove, a Chinese rock garden, and a carp pond. Extensive renovations, both to the interior and exterior of the building, were carried out in 1997 and 2003‚Äì2005 to preserve the beauty of the property and to upgrade the building‚Äôs effectiveness as a work place. People queueing to access American Citizen services and the US Visa Section at Westgate Mall As Shanghai continues to grow, and Sino-U.S. relations develop deeper and broader linkages, the work of the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai also continues to grow and expand. Shanghai has again become a major center of commerce and trade, and is a potent symbol of China‚Äôs rising status. American businesses and citizens have returned to the city in large numbers. The Consulate General‚Äôs large staff works to support and promote American interests, assist U.S. companies and private American citizens, and promote exchanges and dialogue between Chinese and American individuals and institutions. Much has changed in the past century and a half since the United States established a consular presence in Shanghai, but much has also remained the same: the relationship between the Consulate and Shanghai is as vibrant, dynamic and durable as Shanghai itself.

It was published as a book in 1981 and the English translation by Audie E. Bock appeared the following year. Sources In 1980, inspired by the memoir of one of his heroes, Jean Renoir, Kurosawa began to publish in serial form his autobiography, entitled Gama no abura (Toad Oil; a traditional Japanese ointment for medical purposes). In English translations, the book's subtitle Something Like an Autobiography (Ëá™‰ºù„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„ÇÇ„ÅÆ, Jiden no you na mono) is normally used instead. The book deals with the period from the director's birth to his winning the Golden Lion for Rashomon from the Venice Film Festival in 1951; the period from 1951 through 1980 is not covered. The title of the book is a reference to a legend according to which, if one places a deformed toad in a box full of mirrors, it will become so afraid of its own reflection that it will begin to sweat, and this sweat allegedly had medicinal properties. Kurosawa compared himself to the toad, nervous about having to contemplate, through the process of writing his life story, his own multiple \\"reflections.\\" Synopsis The book has 54 chapters which traces Kurosawa's early childhood years through his teenage, where he recollects memories of his schooldays, times spent with his elder brother, and the great Great Kant≈ç earthquake and the destruction left in its aftermath. At the age of 25, shortly after his older brother Heigo committed suicide, Kurosawa responded to an advertisement for recruiting new assistant directors at the film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho) and was subsequently accepted for the position with four others. During his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Kajiro Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto. Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year. Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing and second-unit directing. In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director, Horse (Uma, 1941), Kurosawa took over most of the production, as Yamamoto was occupied with the shooting of another film.

The Consulate General of the United States, Shenyang () is one of seven American diplomatic and consular posts in the People's Republic of China. It is located in Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning.\\"Security Message about Recent Protests at Emei Mountain ( July 8, 2014) \\" (). U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. Retrieved on May 17, 2015. \\"No. 52, 14th Wei Road, Heping District Shenyang 110003\\" Area in yellow colour denotes the consular district of Consulate General Shenyang History The U.S. Consulate in Shenyang was opened in 1904.U.S. Consulate History, U.S Embassy & Consulates in China It was originally housed in two abandoned Chinese temples, ‚ÄúTemples ‚ÄòYi Kung Ssu‚Äô and ‚ÄòScwang Chen Ssu‚Äô located outside the Little West Commerce Gate.‚Äù Sometime before 1924, the Consulate moved to No. 1 Wu Wei Lu, a building which used to house the Russian Consulate. At that time, the United States had several other Consulates in Northeast China, including in Harbin and Dalian. These appear to have been closed by World War II. The Shenyang Consulate was able to continue operations for most of the war but closed in 1949 after the new Chinese Communist Party authorities had imprisoned the remaining consulate staff in their offices for almost a year before expelling them. In 1984, five years after the United States recognized formally established diplomatic relations with the government in Beijing, the Consulate reopened; today it plays a key part in the management of the close relationship the United States has with northeast China. =Adventure in the 1930s and 40s= In the early part of the 20th century, northeast China underwent enormous economic development and population growth. Due primarily to the advent of the railroads developed by Japanese and Russian interests and the rapid in-migration of settlers from Shandong Province and the Korean Peninsula, Shenyang (known then as ‚ÄúMukden‚Äù to most Americans), Harbin, Dalian, Changchun, and other places grew from almost nothing into major cities. For the Americans who were stationed there in the 1930s and 1940s, however, Shenyang increasingly resembled a frontier outpost marked by adventure and danger. Consulate staff dealt with rampant lawlessness, violence, and the complex conflict in Manchuria between an increasingly large Japanese presence in the region, continuing Chinese resistance, and lingering Russian influence. Several articles from the period reported failed attempts to bomb the American and British consulates, hijacking and attacks on trains, bank robberies, thefts, murders, kidnapping, and general mayhem, especially in 1932. One telling example: after ‚Äúbandits‚Äù unsuccessfully attacked the American Consul General during a golf game, Americans began to carry guns whenever they went out to the golf course. According to the New York Times, the 700 mile long South Manchurian railway was raided an average of 42 times daily that year. And several months previously, a Japanese military patrol beat up an American official, Culver B. Chamberlain, while he was on his way to Harbin to become Consul there. In 1934, the New York Times reported another rather minor but interesting episode: ‚ÄúA uniformed Japanese ran amok today at the United States Consulate, waving a bayonet.‚Äù Vice Consul Monroe B. Hall, according to the paper's entertaining account, ‚Äúhearing the noise, investigated, and found the intruder brandishing a bayonet.‚Äù Hall then ‚Äúpicked up a chair and engaged the man, shouting to Vice Consuls Gerald Warner and Andrew Eson for help.‚Äù Warner and Eson responded with ‚Äúimprovised weapons,‚Äù and the three of them fought the crazed soldier off. Complaints to the Japanese Consulate resulted in the soldier's arrest a few hours later. =World War II= After Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese forces took Vice Consul U. Alexis Johnson ‚Äì later a senior official in the Kennedy and Johnson State Departments ‚Äì and his staff prisoners. Released in 1942, Johnson and his staff returned to the United States, along with the American ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, and other civilians unlucky enough to have been captured by the Japanese in Asia. As Time magazine told the story, Johnson rushed down the gangplank of the neutral Swedish ship that had ferried him back to the United States, yelling at the assembled reporters, \\"I don't want to talk to newspapermen. I want to talk to my wife. I haven't seen her in three years.\\" [vi] The magazine continued: [Johnson] spied her in the crowd, walked up to her slowly, gravely. \\"Hello,\\" he said. \\"Hello.\\" \\"How are you?\\" \\"Fine. How are you?\\" They didn't kiss; didn't even shake hands. They just looked at each other for a long while, then walked off and got in a cab. Other Americans were less fortunate. As the war escalated, Shenyang became a holding ground for about 1,700 American and Allied POWs captured by the Japanese from places as far away as the Philippines. They were treated brutally ‚Äì 700 of them died ‚Äì and the healthiest survivors were barely able to walk when they were liberated in 1945 by Soviet Soldiers. The Shenyang municipal government is working with survivors groups to turn the restored POW camp into a museum. =The Cold War= After the end of World War II, the American diplomatic presence in northeast China resumed when Consul General O. Edmund Clubb reopened the Shenyang Consulate in 1945 only to face severe challenges during the final stages of the Chinese Civil War. In November 1948, with the American-supported Nationalist party in retreat in China, Communist Party forces captured Shenyang and, sparked by the onset of the Cold War, relations between China and the United States became increasingly tense. In 1948, the Communist authorities even went so far as to confine the American staff in Shenyang, now led by Consul General Angus I. Ward, to the grounds of the consulate for nearly a year. By 1950, the United States had withdrawn all its diplomats from China. Contact between the United States and China resumed again when Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger reached out to Beijing in 1972. Five years after America and the People's Republic of China established diplomatic relations, the United States reopened its Consulate in Shenyang in 1984. One goal was to help open northeast China‚Äîwith its enormous population of 91 million people and nearly 40 percent of China's heavy industry‚Äîto American investment. There were geopolitical reasons, as well, relating to Chinese relations with the former Soviet Union and North Korea. =Modern Relations= In recent years, a series of American companies ‚Äì including ITT, John Deere, Tyco, Boeing, Johnson Controls, Dell, Intel, Oracle, Citibank, Cessna and other major U.S. firms have all made significant investments in the region, particularly in the port city of Dalian. Major Chinese and U.S. universities have established strong exchange programs, and the U.S. Consulate has an active program of public outreach to local government, business, media, and cultural leaders, as well as to the general public. As political cooperation continues to deepen between the United States and China, the consulate has also played a vital role in meetings between American officials and their counterparts in northeast China, including military officers from the Pacific Command and Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior diplomats, and the U. S. Trade Representative. Because of its proximity to the border with North Korea, the consulate has also worked with local Chinese counterparts on issues related to that country, including nuclear nonproliferation. Underscoring Shenyang's growing importance, the Six Party Talks working group on nuclear disarmament met here in August 2007, and the Consulate provided the American delegation with important assistance.

The consular district included the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the prefecture-level city of Chongqing. Area in orange color denotes the consular district of Consulate General Chengdu History The consulate was opened by Vice President George H.W. Bush in 1985 in an annex of the Jinjiang Hotel. The consulate moved in 1993 to its own compound at #4, Lingshiguan Lu, where it remains. In 1993, the Peace Corps began a program in China, headquartered in Chengdu. A Peace Corps Director and staff were posted in the city. From its beginning, the primary mission of Peace Corps China has been to assist in the training of young Chinese citizens to become English teachers in the rapidly increasing number of junior high schools of the area, specifically in the relatively undeveloped provinces of Gansu, Guizhou, and Sichuan as well as the municipality of Chongqing. There were eighteen teachers in the first group of Peace Corps China Volunteers, and they served in five teacher training institutions. Now, twenty years later, there are about 150 Volunteers teaching in 90 institutions. The consulate compound came under attack in May 1999 by crowds enraged by the US accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The Consul General's Residence was heavily damaged by fire. In 2008, Condoleezza Rice was the first US Secretary of State to visit the consulate. She came in response to the massive Sichuan earthquake that killed approximately 80,000 people. Secretary Rice visited a relief camp in Dujiangyan as well as an emergency water purification project donated by the United States. In February 2012, a Chinese official entered the US Consulate General in Chengdu setting off a political scandal that led to the downfall of Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai in what is now known as the Wang Lijun incident. The Consulate started with only six American officers and approximately 20 local employees. It was made up of an Executive Office (a Consul General and administrative assistant); a small office handling political, economic and commercial issues; a Consular Section; a Management Section and what was then known as the U.S. Information Service. In 1985, each of the offices was covered by one American officer. The Consulate today has grown to 130 total staff. Approximately 100 of these are locally hired professional Chinese staff. On July 24, 2020, China revoked the license for the U.S. General Consulate in Chengdu, and ordered the general consulate to cease operations. This is in retaliation for the closure of the Chinese consulate-general in Houston, Texas on July 22, 2020. The consulate was closed at 10:00 AM on July 27, 2020. Afterwards, Chinese authorities entered through the front entrance and took it over. Bo Xilai corruption scandal In February 2012, Wang Lijun, the vice-mayor of Chongqing, fled to the Consulate General of the United States in Chengdu, where he remained for around 24 hours, amid rumors of political infighting with Chongqing Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai, sparking off the Wang Lijun incident which led to Bo's eventual ouster and trial. Closure On the morning of July 24, 2020, local time, \\"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the US Embassy in China of its decision to withdraw its consent for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu. The Ministry also made specific requirements on the ceasing of all operations and events by the Consulate General.\\" The move was a response to the United States government's to close its consulate in Houston on grounds of national security. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that some Chengdu consulate personnel were \\"conducting activities not in line with their identities\\" and \\"had harmed China‚Äôs security interests\\", but would not elaborate. The White House had urged China earlier in the day to not engage in \\"tit-for-tat retaliation.\\" In immediate reaction to the news of the closure, global stock indexes dropped. On July 27, 2020, the national flag of US was lowered at the Consulate General in Chengdu at 6:18 AM local time by a detachment of US Marine Security Guards assigned with the role of protecting US missions in China.

It is one of America's earliest diplomatic posts in the Far East. The consulate serves the South China region, covering the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Fujian, an area which, according to the latest census in 2010, has a population of nearly 200 million. The consulate general is also the only U.S. mission in Mainland China to process American adoptions and immigrant visas, making it one of the U.S. Department of State‚Äôs busiest consular-related posts. History of the consulate =Beginning= The beginning of the American consulate in Guangzhou dates back over two centuries to the founding years of the American republic, even before George Washington was elected as the first President of the United States. Consulate Guangzhou (known as Canton at that time), as America‚Äôs oldest diplomatic post in China and one of America‚Äôs oldest posts in the Far East, has played a pivotal role in promoting America‚Äôs relationship with China. In 1784, the American merchant ship Empress of China reached what was then known as the port of Canton transporting ginseng to trade for Chinese black tea. The ship also carried on it Major Samuel Shaw, a 29-year-old former Revolutionary War artillery officer, who served as the business agent for this first American trade effort to the \\"Middle Kingdom.\\" Shaw wrote to Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, recommending that the young United States appoint a consul and vice consul to Canton. \\"Such officers,\\" he noted, \\"would have a degree of weight and respect which private adventurers cannot readily acquire, and which would enable them to render essential services to their countrymen.\\" Major Shaw was appointed the first American consul to China, although he would serve \\"with neither salary nor perquisites but with the confidence and esteem of the United States.\\" =Traders, treaties, and diplomats= At that time, Chinese authorities limited trade with the outside world to the port of Canton. All foreign traders were further restricted to living and working on factory compounds established on the banks of the Pearl River. American trade with China increased steadily throughout the early decades of the nineteenth century, although there were long periods during which the office of the U.S. Consul at Canton was unoccupied, and Americans serving at the consulate typically did not speak Chinese. In the wake of the Opium War between China and Great Britain, however, the Chinese government was compelled to expand trading opportunities beyond Canton. After the conclusion of the hostilities, the first U.S. formal mission to China, led by former Congressman Caleb Cushing, brokered the 1844 Treaty of Wanghia, an agreement which secured trading privileges for American merchants and opened new Chinese ports to American vessels. In addition to protecting the interests of United States merchants, American consuls enjoyed greater authority granted by Congress; in 1848 the consulate was allowed to arraign U.S. citizens charged with offenses against the laws of China. The Canton consulate was burned down in 1856, but U.S. diplomats continued to support an expanding American presence in the region throughout the nineteenth century. Aside from Guangzhou, U.S. Consulates were present in South China in the other opened ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen. However, due to a parsimonious and semi-isolationist U.S. Congress, these consulates frequently remained unoccupied. In fact, British and German officials were often asked to represent U.S. interests. This continued until the mid 1880s when the Shanghai Consul General began administering all consular services in China. At other times, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou also shared this responsibility. =Years of turmoil and change= With the concurrence of the British government, the U.S., in 1873, built a consulate on Shamian Island, a sandy one kilometer long strip of land around which a man- made canal had been dug ten years before to separate it from the rest of the city. Along with their European counterparts, foreign diplomatic personnel tried to recreate a Western lifestyle. They built Anglican and Catholic churches, tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, and long promenades. Today, visitors to Shamian Island can still see the vestiges of late eighteenth century and nineteenth century Western life. While life on Shamian was peaceful and stable, life off of the island for the Chinese was not. Increasing dissatisfaction with the Qing Dynasty led to protests and its eventual overthrow. The Second Sino-Japanese War precipitated the withdrawal of consulate personnel in Fuzhou in 1934 and Canton in 1938. Subsequent to Japan's surrender to the Allies, many U.S. Consulates in China reopened. For several months in 1949, after the Chinese Nationalist government moved its headquarters from Nanjing to Guangzhou, Shamian Island served as the site of the State Department's \\"Office of Embassy.\\" As the civil war raged between Chinese Nationalist and Communist forces, the Nationalist government decided once again to move the seat of government to Chungking (Chongqing) and the Office of Embassy followed. Consulate Canton itself was closed in August, 1949, and diplomatic relations between the communist government of mainland China and the United States ceased shortly thereafter. =Reopening= Former chancery on Shamian Island which housed the consulate general between 1990 and 2013. In the wake of the landmark visits of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon, the United States and China formally re- established diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979. According to an agreement, each country was allowed to set up two consulates. The United States chose Shanghai and Guangzhou (China chose San Francisco and Houston). On August 31, 1979, almost 30 years to the day that Consulate Canton had been closed, Vice-President Walter Mondale unveiled the seal for the new U.S. Consulate Guangzhou on the 11th floor of the Dongfang Hotel at 120 Liu Hua Road. Richard L. Williams was appointed the first Consul General in China since 1949. In April 1990, the Consulate returned to Shamian Island when the new Consulate Tower, built on reclaimed land near the Pearl River, was completed at 1 Shamian South Street, next to the White Swan Hotel. Since reopening, the consulate's efforts have focused on two main issues: immigration and commerce. As South China has historically been the home for most Chinese immigrants to America, Guangzhou was designated as the sole immigrant visa processing post for all of China in the early 1980s. Additionally, in 1992 all adoption processing was assigned to Guangzhou. Immigrant and non-immigrant visa numbers have risen in the past 30 years. Whereas in 1979 the Consulate processed about 27,000 visa applicants (both non-immigrant and immigrant visas), today it adjudicates annually over 1 million applications. In order to better accommodate the rising number of applicants, on August 6, 2005, the consular section moved to a more spacious office facility at the Tianyu Garden Building on Linhe Zhong Road in Tianhe District. The facility had 30 interviewing windows available for 23 American staff and 100 locally employed personnel. Meanwhile, the economic growth in South China, and particularly the Pearl River Delta (or PRD, the region surrounding the Pearl River from Shenzhen to Zhuhai) has been extraordinary. Since 1980, the GDP of the Pearl River Delta region has grown annually at 16 percent and about 1/3 of all of China's global exports originate from this area of 35 million people. In view of such growth, in 1985 the Department of Commerce opened a Foreign Commercial Service Office and the Department of Agriculture opened a Foreign Agricultural Office in the China Hotel on Liuhua Road. The public affairs section, located in the Garden Hotel, distributed press releases and backgrounders on American policy, organised press conferences and other media events. = Attack accusations = In May 2018, an American state employee reported sickness after hearing disturbing sounds. A week later, a security engineering officer, his wife, and their two kids were evacuated for having similar symptoms. After the Embassy attack accusations in Cuba, state officials have launched an investigation into these unexplained health incidents.  New consulate compound  The new consulate compound in Zhujiang New Town The new consulate-general compound is located in Zhujiang New Town, the newly developed CBD of the city. It is America's second purpose- built diplomatic facility in China, following the completion of the Beijing Embassy in 2008. The State Department spent $267 million on the project, as part of a multi-year, $1.5 billion building plan for the American missions in China. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2009, attended by then U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman. The new consulate was designed by SOM, and constructed by two companies from China and America which employed more than 800 workers from both countries. Occupying a site of 7.4 acres, the consulate compound includes seven building of different functions situated in a garden setting. It was opened on 23 July 2013 and accommodated nearly 400 employees with consulate offices scattered around the city moving in. The consulate was officially unveiled in March 2014 with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by U.S. Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy.

He joined the local regional music school Ach√° Martinez directed by Prof. Nilo Soruco Arancibia. Thereafter, the first award he won was the 1st place in the Festival del Canto y la Aloja in 1993 with the unreleased cueca La fiesta de San Roque. A year later he obtained at the same festival the 2nd place next to Guido Medinaceli and, also, the 3rd place together with Edna Aparicio in the duet category.

In 2004, Hu√°scar participated in a competition based on the exhibition of precious stones known as bolivianitas, which inspired him to compose the song entitled La bolivianita. This song was presented in a musical event attended by important Bolivian composers in which H√∫ascar won the 1st place with his composition. This event marked the beginning of a series of international tours. He visited 80 countries to present their music and this gemstone.  Death  He died on June 21, 2013 in the T'iyumayu, Tomina, town of Padilla, Bolivia, Chuquisaca Department, Bolivia at the age 41 years old due to a car accident. Hu√°scar was going to give a concert in Villamontes, Tarija with his sons Rolando Aparicio L√≥pez (14 years old), Gustavo Aparicio L√≥pez (13 years old) and two other members of his band, Rimber Callejas Brito (violin) and Fernando Anibarro Cruz (guitar). Due to the bad weather conditions and to an intense mist, the vehicle fell off a cliff of 250 meters. It happened at noon at a place called T'iyumayu, about 270 kilometers east of Sucre, close to the town of Monteagudo, in the Chaco area. In addition to the artist and his son Gustavo, who played drums, the guitarist Fernando Anibarro Limbert Cruz and the violinist Limbert Callejas Brito also died.

It resulted with the death of four individuals travelling together; one of the four intended victims survived the crash. Abdullah √áatlƒ±, a former ultra-rightist militant wanted by police for multiple murders and drug trafficking; Huseyin Kocadaƒü, a senior police official; and beauty queen Gonca Us (√áatlƒ±'s girlfriend) were killed. Sedat Bucak, an MP, escaped with a broken leg and fractured skull. The Susurluk crash was a key event in the unravelling of the \\"deep state\\" in Turkey, as the peculiar associations of the crash victims and their links with Interior Minister Mehmet Aƒüar led to a number of investigations, including a parliamentary investigation, of what became known as the Susurluk scandal. Background Prior to the crash, all the victims, plus Interior Minister Mehmet Aƒüar, had been staying at the Onura Hotel in Ku≈üadasƒ±. The assassination plan called for Aƒüar to be killed too. However, he was warned by Sami Ho≈ütan so he remained at the hotel and told the rest to leave without him. Former MHP deputy Kubilay Uygun said that he was introduced to Abdullah √áatlƒ± and H√ºseyin Kocadaƒü three days before the accident by a now-retired lieutenant general. Uygun says that he too has worked for the \\"deep state\\". The Prosecutor's Report said that the passengers in the car were on their way to stage an assassination. Event A Mercedes 600 SEL owned by Bucak crashed into a truck near √áatalceviz, Susurluk in the Balƒ±kesir province in Turkey. The crash took place on 3 November 1996 at around 19:25 TR&. The car was travelling at nearly .Hurriyet Daily News, 19 September 1997, Curtain Falls on Susurluk Tragicomedy Abdullah √áatlƒ±, a former ultra-rightist militant wanted by police for multiple murders and drug trafficking; Huseyin Kocadaƒü, a senior police official; and beauty queen Gonca Us (√áatlƒ±'s girlfriend) were killed in the crash. Kocadaƒü, √áatlƒ±, and Us died, either immediately, or soon afterwards. Bucak escaped with a broken leg and fractured skull. According to an anonymous witness in the 2007 Ergenekon investigation, everyone initially survived the crash, which was precipitated by remotely disabling the brakes of the Mercedes. A three-person team came and snapped the necks of Us and √áatlƒ±. Bucak was rescued by his guards, who also took his bag from the boot (trunk) and called Grey Wolf Haluk Kƒ±rcƒ±. One of the first people to visit the site was mafia king Ali Yasak, better known as \\"Drej Ali\\", who took √áatlƒ±'s bag from the car, according to Tuncay G√ºney. Veli K√º√ß√ºk refutes G√ºney's allegation that Yasak acted on his orders. A prosecutor from Ilgin made similar allegations ten years ago. Alleged drug baron Sami Ho≈ütan said that Bucak's guards were Ercan Ersoy and Ali Fevzi Bir (a.k.a. \\"Ali√ßo\\"). The guards called Ho≈ütan, who then called Bucak's friend Abd√ºlgani Gƒ±zƒ±lkaya, and Veli K√º√ß√ºk, allegedly because the accident occurred in his Gendarmerie's precinct.In Turkey, the Gendarmerie in responsible for policing inter-city areas; 92% of the country. Driving to the scene of the accident, Ho≈ütan saw Drej Ali. Ho≈ütan said that Mehmet Eym√ºr called while he, √áatlƒ±, and Bucak were driving together, before the accident. Eym√ºr asked √áatlƒ± about the murder of Mƒ∞T spy Tarƒ±k √úmit. Eym√ºr reportedly told √úmit's daughter, Hande Birinci, that her father worked with Korkut Eken (an adviser to Aƒüar) on the side and that he was assassinated by Aƒüar's men after he became disgusted by their corruption.\\"My father killed by Agar's team\\", Radikal, 1996, quoted in Evidence Evidence seized at the crash site indicated that √áatlƒ± had been carrying: * diplomatic credentials, given by the Turkish authorities * a government-approved weapons permit. * a fake passport in the name of Mehmet √ñzbay; the same alias used by Mehmet Ali Aƒüca. * numerous 9mm Beretta and Saddam (Beretta 92) pistols, one .22 caliber Beretta with a silencer, and two Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns. * two listening devices. * a cache of narcotics. * thousands of U.S. dollars. Aftermath The truck driver, Hasan G√∂k√ße, was held responsible for the accident and sentenced to three years in jail. He was bailed for 6.42 million TL. His truck (a 1968 Ford) was foreclosed after he failed to pay his taxes.

The protest was organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard and joined in by workers from other companies in the city and other residents of Split after radio broadcast appeals for help while the protesters marched through the streets. Ultimately, the protest drew 100,000 supporters. The march ended in a picket in front of the Banovina building, where the JNA had its headquarters in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to the JNA-imposed blockade of the village of Kijevo. Scuffles broke out in front of the building, and a JNA soldier was killed by a gunshot reportedly fired from the crowd. Four organisers of the protest were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a military court and convicted. They were released months later in a prisoner exchange. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) then confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana) in order to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. After two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991, and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than the preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expanding Serbia. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to its first fatalities. The JNA intervened on the side of the insurgents, and prevented the Croatian police from taking action. In early April, the leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intent to integrate the area under their control, viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region, with Serbia. In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defences, it doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police. The Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved from January 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman was to win support from the European Community (EC) and the United States for Croatia, and he disregarded advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuƒëman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. Protest The immediate cause for a confrontation with the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladiƒá, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuƒëman called on the public to bring the siege to its end. The protest took place on 6 May 1991 in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in Brodosplit Shipyard, in response to Tuƒëman's earlier statement. The protest started out with 10,000 shipyard workers, but ultimately drew approximately 100,000 people, from the shipyard and other factories in Split to a protest march through the city, carrying Croatian flags. The protest march grew in number as more citizens joined in, following radio broadcast messages calling for support. In order to prevent the Yugoslav Navy from intervening using ships equipped with water cannons, Jadrolinija ships were used to obstruct access to the port. The protesters picketed around the Banovina building, which housed the command centres of the JNA Military-Maritime District and the Yugoslav Navy at the time. The protesters demanded lifting of the blockade of Kijevo, withdrawal of armoured personnel carriers parked in front of the Banovina building and hoisting of a Croatian flag on the building itself. During the protest, the crowd assaulted a JNA armoured personnel carrier and managed to remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Baliƒá, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by the crowd. In a scuffle which broke out in front of the building, Sa≈°ko Ge≈°ovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed. Aftermath Besides Ge≈°ovski, there were no fatalities, but several JNA soldiers were wounded. Ge≈°ovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuƒëman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Ge≈°ovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death as proof that Tuƒëman's government had revived the fascist Usta≈°e, which controlled Croatia during World War II. Then-mayor of Split Onesin Cvitan claimed that Ge≈°ovski was fired upon from the Banovina building. However, the Croatian State Attorney's Office contradicted him, claiming that Ge≈°ovski was killed by someone in the crowd picketing in front of the building. An investigation was launched but the case was dropped because of lack of evidence. The JNA's security service in Split, run by Colonel Ljubi≈°a Beara, identified Mato Sabljiƒá, Ivan Begonja, Roland Zvonariƒá and Branko Glavinoviƒá as organisers of the protest where the killing occurred and arrested them on 5 June. They were put on trial at a military court in Sarajevo on 19 August, convicted and sentenced to one and a half to eight years in prison. The group was imprisoned in Foƒça until 25 November, when they were exchanged for JNA prisoners of war. The protest is commemorated annually in Split and a monograph covering the event was issued in 2011. In the wake of the protest, the JNA increased combat readiness of its garrison in Split and elsewhere in Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from Split to its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up potable water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut. The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks. The siege of Kijevo was lifted days after the protest through negotiations and two weeks after the JNA blockaded the village. However, the arrangement proved short-lived as JNA units, again led by Mladiƒá, attacked Kijevo and destroyed a substantial part of the village. The attack began when Croatian forces refused to surrender to Croatian Serb leader Milan Martiƒá. It was one of the first instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating Croatian War of Independence.

Retrieved 25 June 201. There is no firm date for when the changeover occurred, as the replacement of the sea bed is a continuous process, though reconstruction maps often change the name from Panthalassic to Pacific around the time the Atlantic Ocean began to open. The Panthalassic Ocean first opened around 750 million years ago at the breakup of Rodinia, but the oldest Pacific Ocean floor is only around 180 Ma old. Any older Pacific floor crust has been subducted. During the Jurassic period, four tectonic plates developed in the Pacific Basin: the Kula and the Farallon in the north, the large Pacific Plate in the centre and south and the Phoenix Plate in the far south. The Kula Plate was subducted under the eastern and south-eastern Asian landmass. The northern part of the Farallon was subducted under North America while its southern section, together with the Phoenix Plate, was subducted under South America and the Antarctic. During the late Tertiary period, the Farallon plate broke up, leaving the Juan de Fuca Plate in the north, the Cocos Plate off today's Central America, and the Nazca and Phoenix Plates in the southern Pacific. Charles Darwin had proposed a theory of the slow subsidence of the ocean floor based on his studies of Pacific oceanic islands, seamounts (underwater volcanoes) and guyots (flat- topped seamounts). His observations have been verified and expanded in the development of plate tectonic theory. The tectonic plates continue to move today. The slowest ridge spreading rate is across the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean which separates at less than 2.5 cm/yr while the fastest, across the East Pacific Rise near Easter Island, has a spreading rate of over 15 cm/yr.\\"Understanding plate motions\\", USGS.

Retrieved 26 June 2013. Geological origins of the Pacific islands The theory of plate tectonics, which is supported by seismology, volcanology, gravimetry, and paleomagnetism (remanent magnetism), explains the origin of the physical features of the Pacific. The islands of the Pacific have developed in a number of ways. Some have originated as chains of volcanic islands on the tectonic plates either as a result of mantle plumes or by fracture propagation. Atolls have developed in tropical waters when, after volcanos sink, coral growth results in reefs as evidenced by the Cook Islands. Coral reefs can develop into islands over a submerged extinct volcano following uplift as in Makatea and Rennell Island in the Solomon Archipelago which have steep coral cliffs over 100 metres high. The collision of two plates, resulting in subduction, have contributed to the emergence of the western Pacific arcs of volcanic islands. A new crust has emerged as the East Pacific Rise. In the northeastern Pacific margin there is a lateral shift, through the San Andreas Fault system, of the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. Plate movements have also caused fragments of continental crust to be rotated away from landmasses so as to form islands. Zealandia which broke off from Gondwana 70 million years ago with the spreading of the Tasman Sea, has since resulted in island protrusions such as New Zealand and New Caledonia. Related causes of island formation include obduction and subduction at convergent plate boundaries. Malaita and Ulawa in the Solomon Islands are the result of obduction while the effects of subduction can be seen in the formation of volcanic island arcs such as the Aleutian Arc off Alaska and the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone north of New Zealand. As a result of the collision of the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate, the Andes Mountains emerged in western South America, close to the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench. Many large fracture zones aligned in an east-west direction, occur in the floor of the northeastern Pacific. Andesite line The Pacific is a broad ocean basin (unlike the narrow Atlantic Ocean) and extends over a width of between New Guinea and Peru. The andesite line, a zone of intense volcanic and seismic activity, is a major regional distinction in the Pacific. The petrologic boundary separates the deeper mafic igneous rock of the Central Pacific Basin from the partially submerged continental areas of felsic igneous rock on its margins. The andesite line follows the western edge of the islands off California and passes south of the Aleutian arc, along the eastern edge of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, Japan, the Mariana Islands, the Solomon Islands, and New Zealand's North Island. The dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the Andes Cordillera along South America to Mexico, returning then to the islands off California. Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, New Guinea, and New Zealand lie outside the andesite line. Outside of the andesite line, volcanism is explosive; the Pacific Ring of Fire is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism. The Ring of Fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones. In 2009, the deepest undersea eruption ever recorded occurred at the West Mata submarine volcano, a mile beneath the ocean, close to the Tonga-Kermadec Trench, within the Ring of Fire; it was filmed by the US Jason robotic submersible which descended over . The Pacific Ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones. Only the Antarctic and Australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones. Earthquakes In March and April 2008, a series or swarm of moderate earthquakes occurred both near and within the Blanco Fracture Zone. The swarm began on 30 March when over 600 measurable tremors began occurring north of the zone within the Juan de Fuca Plate. A decade earlier, in January 1998, another swarm was detected at Axial Seamount in the Juan de Fuca Ridge. At the time of its occurrence, scientists were not aware that the series of faults in this plate even existed. In a remote region of the central Pacific Ocean, at the southeastern section of the Gilbert Islands, a major swarm of intraplate earthquakes occurred between December 1981 and March 1983, with no prior seismicity having been reported in this region previously. Another swarm was detected on the Queen Charlotte Islands fracture zone in August‚ÄìSeptember 1967.

It was mostly returned to farm land from the late 1960s onwards, though the site is still owned and used to some extent by the Republic of Korea Air Force, in particular a grass airstrip known semi- officially as Alddreu Airport. History The airfield, then known as Altehru Airfield, was originally developed in 1926-30 during the Japanese Imperial period. Initially, it was primarily used as a refueling station, as well as a base for reconnaissance and maritime patrol aircraft. During the Second Sino- Japanese War it was also used as a forward base of the Omura Naval Air Group for the bombing of cities in China such as Shanghai and Nanjing. =World War II= Among other things, the base was used for the training of Kamikaze pilots and by the end of the war it housed 2500 naval aviation troops and 25 aircraft in hardened aircraft shelters. Nearing the end of the Pacific War the Japanese were facing an inevitable defeat. Fearing a fight on Japanese soil, they planned on using Jeju's Alddreu Airfield as a last resort to defend against the Allied forces. =Korean War= The USAF designated the base as Cheju-do No.2 or K-40. It was apparently mainly used as a refueling & communications facility and came under the umbrella of the 100th Air Base Wing from 5 August 1951. Along with an airfield security company of the USAF's Air Police, there were communications, civil engineering, and food service companies permanently based at K-40 during this period. =Postwar= A TACAN facility was built on the base, now known as Alddreu Airfield, during the early 1960s. Alddreu was handed over by the USAF to the ROKAF in the later part of that decade. The base continues to be owned by the Korean Air Force but has been largely leased to civilians since the time of the handover, with most of the site being currently used as potato fields, though a large number of pre- and post-war facilities are still intact to one degree or another. These include 19 (out of an original 20) World War II aircraft bunkers, and a 1,400-meter grass runway which is still in use as a reserve airstrip by the ROKAF. Seogwipo City planned at one stage during the late 2000s to develop the area as a theme park.

The film stars Eddie Albert, Faye Marlowe and Gail Patrick. The supporting cast features C. Aubrey Smith and William Frawley. The plot involves a World War II serviceman who surreptitiously flies back from England to the States to see his wife for several hours and impregnates her, accidentally leaving her to deal with the consequent scandal when the townsfolk do the math and erroneously conclude that her husband could not possibly be the resultant baby's father. The film was released on July 22, 1946, by Republic Pictures. Plot Ex serviceman Jeffrey Dolan is held incarcerated in a New Jersey jail, suspected of murder. He gets a visit from a night club singer, Dolores Starr, and recapitulates the events leading him to his current miserable situation. Not long ago Jeffrey was an Air Force clerk stationed in London. He shared a bomb shelter with a British man he calls \\"The Old Duffer\\", and tells the man about his wonderful wife Annie and her exquisite cakes, for which he longs. Jeffrey manages to get a three-day pass. His Air Force friends persuade him to go AWOL with them as they fly overnight to the U.S., so that he can visit his wife on their wedding anniversary. General Trent is traveling with them on the plane, and he almost discovers Jeffrey as they fly over the Atlantic. When the friends arrive at their destination, Jeff is taken by two of them, Spence and Avery, to the Bongo Club, mainly because Avery's girl Dolores Starr sings at the club. Jeffrey bumps into an old friend, Everett Thorndyke, and since Everett is currently in the company of his mistress, they agree to not talk about their visit there. Eventually Jeffrey gets home to see Annie and they share a very romantic evening together. Annie promises not to tell anyone about his visit, but sends a piece with him back, which he gives to The Old Duffer. Jeffrey also tells the man he has been AWOL. Jeffrey is discharged and returns home nine months later, and is overjoyed when he finds out his wife has given birth to a son. People in town looks strangely at him and he soon realizes it is because they think the child is someone else's, not knowing about his secret visit. A lawyer tells him he has to prove his paternity, or the baby will lose its inheritance of half a million dollars. Jeffrey has only one week to prove he is the father. Jeffrey reaches out to everyone he saw that particular night, but Thorndyke denies meeting him at the Bongo Club, and the same goes for Avery and Spence, who are afraid of being court-martialed. It also turns out that General Trent, who was on the same plane, doesn't remember seeing him at all. Jeffrey tries to get hold of a photograph taken of him at the Bongo Club and visits the photographer, Louise Grapa, together with Dolores. It turns out Jeffrey isn't in the photograph at all, and he is also attacked by Dolores' jealous husband, Phil Denim. Jeffrey knocks Phil unconscious. Dolores, relieved, kisses Jeff on the cheek, and when Louise snaps a photo, unscrupulous newspaperman Al Morgan prints it in the paper. Annie sees the photo and confronts Jeffrey with cheating. In the same paper, Jeffrey notices an article about The Old Duffer, whose real name is Sir Archibald Clyde. He is in the U.S. on a visit from London. Jeffrey runs over to meet the old man, and spots the newspaperman who printed the picture of him and Dolores once he arrives. Furious, he attacks the man, Morgan, and is apprehended by Clyde's guards. Jeffrey is arrested for suspicion of trying to murder Clyde. When Jeffrey has told Dolores the full story, she agrees to help him. She contacts Clyde, Spence and Avery and brings them to Jeffrey's house to prove Jeffrey's version of the story. Thorndyke is also summoned, and the story is interesting enough to be published in the papers. In the end Jeffrey manages to prove his paternity, and his son is granted the rights to his inheritance.

The BBC described this debut as \\"a pivotal moment in the history of ballet,\\" as it launched the careers of both Ashton and Ballet Rambert. The music was by Eugene Goossens, arranged by Ernest Irving. The ballet was inspired by the tragic suicide of the 17th-century French chef, Fran√ßois Vatel. In 1671, Vatel was responsible for a grand banquet in honour of King Louis XIV and became so upset that the fish delivery was late that he killed himself with a sword. In the ballet, the tale is of a couturier who despairs when his work is not liked and then kills himself with a pair of scissors. The style of the ballet was influenced by the sophisticated productions of Sergei Diaghilev in the 1920s such as Les biches. It was Ashton's first choreographed work and it was for a 1926 revue staged by Nigel Playfair and Rambert's husband Ashley Dukes. The Observer commented: > an engaging little ballet called 'A Tragedy of Fashion: or The Scarlet > Scissors' which Mr. Eugene Goossens has set most suitably to music. Miss > Marie Rambert, as an impudently vivacious mannequin, and Mr. Frederick > Ashton as a distracted man modist, lead the dancing. It is as chic a trifle > as Mr Playfair's modish establishment leads you to expect. The costumes and scenery were by Sophie Fedorovitch, who continued to work with Ashton for more than twenty years, and became, in his words, \\"not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser.\\" In 2004, Ballet Rambert revived it as part of their celebration of Ashton's birth centenary, reinterpreted and restyled by choreographer Ian Spink, following six months of research. The Guardian review gave it four stars and commented \\"It is a witty and clever achievement but Spink and his superb collaborators have gone one better. They have imbued Tragedy with the quality that made Ashton irresistible - his charm.\\" References Category:Ballets by Frederick Ashton Category:1926 ballet premieres Category:Ballets designed by Sophie Fedorovitch ","title":"A Tragedy of Fashion"},{"id":"39756132","text":"Robert Holden Webb (22 February 1806 ‚Äì 10 March 1880) was an English cricketer with amateur status, later an Anglican priest.

While Miles returns to his family and his job at the bank, Johnny has a hard time adapting to the tedious ordinary life in the small town and starts working as a bus driver. One day he quits his job. Joe Patillo (Henry Morgan), his other pilot buddy from the Army, is planning to start flying again, using a surplus Douglas C-47 transport aircraft. Johnny and Miles both agree to join Joe in California where Joe lives, and get their first job, to fly to New York. Since Johnny is forbidden to fly, Miles and Joe fly the C-47 to New York. Miles's wife Sally (Faye Marlowe) is anxious about him flying again and asks why Johnny is not flying. Ashamed over his inability to fly. Johnny lies, telling Sally that he needs to work with the administration and marketing of the company. Joe and Miles return with a passenger in the aircraft, Anne Cummings (Martha Stewart). Johnny is upset since he was not informed, and does not calm down knowing Anne paid for the trip. He is further upset when he finds out that Anne is hired as the new company mechanic. Johnny keeps trying to get business for the company and works hard to get a contract with oil tycoon J.P. Hartley (Roy Roberts). He fails because Hartley considers their operation too small to carry out the work. Instead they continue flying for other companies. After a while Anne demands they use the earnings on repairing the aircraft. Since the men do not follow her advice she takes matters in her own hands and talks to the owner of a garage, Harry (Charles Tannen), about the repairs and the aircraft is transported there.

The Internal Russian passport is an internal passport used for travel and identification purposes within Russia, which is distinct from the International Russian passport used by Russian citizens to travel in and out of Russian borders. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet Union internal passport continued to be issued until 1997, when a new regulating decree was adopted by the government and when it was replaced by the Russian internal passport. The current Russian internal passports were first issued in 2007. The Russian government is planning to replace the Internal Passport with a biometric, credit card size card. The Universal electronic card issued between 2013 and 2016 was planned to replace the Russian Internal passport as the sole national identity document for Russian citizens but was scrapped in early 2017. History =Background= After the liberation of the serfs the peasant was declared by the law as attached to the former tax-paying estate or having a rural station (sel‚Äôskoe sostoianie). Membership in the peasant community, the legally mandatory reception of allotment land, arrears and collective responsibility characterized this rural station, and the passport system and residence permit enforced it. The internal passport was issued only in the local district office and was valid for the entire empire while the identification card () was valid only within 30 Verst (approximately thirty kilometers) of the place of registration, were critical for obtaining work outside a farmer own district.Bradley, p. 107 =Modern time= In 1992, passports ‚Äì or other photo identification documents ‚Äì became necessary to board a train. Train tickets started to bear passenger names, allegedly, as an effort to combat speculative reselling of the tickets. On 9 December 1992, special pages were introduced which were affixed in Soviet passports, certifying that the bearer of the passport was a citizen of Russia. These pages were optional unless travelling to the other former Soviet republics which continued to accept Soviet passports; for other occasions, other proofs of citizenship were accepted as well. Issuance of the pages continued until the end of 2002. On 8 July 1997, the currently-used design of the Russian internal passport was introduced.Decree of the President of the Russian Federation from 13.03.1997 N 232 ‚ÄòAbout main identity document of the citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation‚Äô (–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–§ –æ—Ç 13.03.1997 ‚Ññ232 –û–± –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–µ —É–¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è—é—â–µ–º –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏). Unlike the Soviet passports, which had three photo pages, the new passports only have one. A passport is first issued at the age of 14, and then replaced upon reaching the ages of 20 and 45. The text in the passports is in Russian, but passports issued in autonomous entities may, on the bearer's request, contain an additional page duplicating all data in one of the official local languages. A deadline for exchanging old passports for the new ones was initially set at year-end of 2001, but then extended several times and finally set at 30 June 2004. The government had first regulated that having failed to exchange one's passport would constitute a punishable violation. However, the Supreme Court ruled to the effect that citizens cannot be obliged to exchange their passports. The Soviet passports ceased to be valid as means of personal identification since mid-2004, but it is still legal (though barely practical) to have one. The propiska was formally abandoned soon after adoption of the current Constitution in 1993, and replaced with \\"residency registration\\" which, in principle, was simply record of one's place of residence. Nevertheless, under the new regulations, permanent registration records are stamped in citizens' internal passports just as were propiskas. This has led to the widespread misconception that registration was just a new name for the propiska; in fact, many still continue to call it \\"propiska\\". This misconception is partly reinforced by the fact that the existing regulations for registration make it an onerous process, being dependent on the will and consent of landlords and which effectively prevents tenants from registering themselves. Internal Russian passports are issued only inside the country. Russian citizens who live abroad can get internal passport only if they visit Russia, i.e., it is not possible to get internal passport in the Russian consulate abroad. In practice, Russian citizens who live abroad often do not get new internal passports at all, as the law allows them to prove their identity with an international Russian passport (travel document). Description right right Each passport has a data page and a signature page. A data page has a visual zone which contains a photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the holder: * Surname * Given name and patronymic * Sex * Date of birth * Place of birth Special records shall be made in the passport: * on the registration of a citizen within a community/at a specific address and on removal from the registration records; * on the military conscription of citizens who have by the time is 18 years old; * on the registration and termination of a marriage; * for children under 14 years of age; * for any previously issued basic identity documents of a citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation; * for the extradition of the main documents of identity of the citizen of the Russian Federation outside the Russian Federation ‚Äì only about valid ones at the time mention is made. At the citizen's request, the passport may also include: * the holder's blood type and the Rh factor (added by the medical facility where the citizen's blood type and Rh were tested, for example after a blood transfusion or donation); * the holder's tax identification number. = Replacement = Renewal of the Passport is regulated by a decree ‚Ññ828 of 1997-2018 issued by the government which was signed by V. Chernomyrdin. According to the decree passports are due to be issued and replaced when the owner reaches certain age: at 14, 20, and 45 years old. Upon reaching age of 20 and 45, the passport must be replaced within 30 days after date of birth. While undergoing military conscription, the passport can be issued or replaced at their place of residence at the end of the set period of military service. If a citizen is imprisoned, administration of a penal entity should return passport or render obtainment of a new one upon punishment is complete. Replacement with identity cards In November 2010 the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the cancellation of internal passports with the aim of replacing them with plastic identity cards or driver's licenses by 2025. Country-wide replacement was postponed until 15 March 2018 not to interfere with 2016 Duma election Russian Federal Government Decree ‚Ññ315 from 16.04.2016 (Russian) and then until 2022.

Early in his career he played clarinet and piano, but he eventually focused solely on clarinet and later added vocals. He also composed throughout his career for clarinet. Rick Bogart worked in New Orleans during the \\"heyday\\" of the French Quarter during the mid 1970s within the first five blocks of Bourbon Street. At that time, there were fifteen full-time Jazz bands along those blocks. During this time he played in the bands of Snookum Russell and Wallace Davenport at the Paddock Lounge, and with June Gardner, Nick Gagliardi, Milton Ziedrich and Thomas Jefferson at the Famous Door. Bogart later moved to New York City to refine and broaden his style. He played in Atlantic City, Cleveland, New York City, Miami, and touring the world headlining on cruise ships for decades. He has written songs for major movies produced for HBO and is the subject of the documentary When the Clarinet Swings. He is most closely aligned with his New Orleans and Swing-style background. However, he has broadened his style over the course of his career by living and working in New York, and working with many musicians of varying styles around the world.  Early life  Rick Bogart was born to Carlos Hern√†ndez (from Madrid, Spain) and mother Audrey Bogart McBride on February 10, 1951. Rick Bogart's father changed his last name to Hardeman upon immigration to the United States, thus Rick Bogart was born Charles Richard Hern√†ndez Hardeman. He later changed his name to Rick Bogart (which was his mother's maiden name). His mother was herself an artist, clarinetist, and singer. Rick began piano studies at the age of 8, and clarinet at age 11. His clarinet studies were first with a retired big band musician, \\"Mr. Reader.\\" According to Bogart, He had the distinct honor of meeting and having a private session with Jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain. Fountain let him play his clarinet and gave Rick Bogart advice about playing the clarinet. He attended Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music's High School Preparatory School, studying classical piano and clarinet. He went on to graduate from North Texas State University with his Bachelor of Music with a concentration in piano, clarinet (with Leon Russianoff, Kalmen Opperman, Gervase dePeyer), and voice (with Eugene Conley of the Metropolitan Opera).  Career  Directly out of school, Bogart became the youngest union musician to lead a band at the Famous Door in New Orleans, a popular jazz club on Bourbon Street. He would lead a band called \\"The Basin Street Five\\" for a year and continued to perform at the Famous Door from 1976 to 1980. With Thomas Jefferson, Bogart played during the day-time slot at the Famous Door from noon to five, six days a week, for 14 months. Jefferson's music greatly influenced Bogart, especially his singing, and the latter developed an appreciation for musicians who could sing and play an instrument. He also played alongside Snookum Russell, Wallace Davenport, June Gardner, Nick Gagliardi, Milton Ziedrich, and occasionally Al Hirt. In 1975, he began voice study with Louis Panzeri, who had a voice studio on Bourbon Street. He was a noted voice teacher and singer in New Orleans. He decided to move to New York in December 1980. Concurrently, he was offered a long-term contract to play at the Theatrical Grill in Cleveland, Ohio. He therefore began commuting for months at a time to Cleveland. It was there that he was discovered by Public Relations Executive Ron Watt who scheduled a number of television spots on the NBC affiliate station. He auditioned for Blake Cumbers, entertainment director at Atlantic City's Harrah's Casino in 1983 and was hired to headline on the spot. He would play there 18‚Äì24 weeks a year from 1983‚Äì1994. After the entertainment industry changed in Atlantic City, Bogart began teaching English at Park West High School in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan from 1997 to 99. At the time Hell's Kitchen was a notoriously dangerous neighborhood and the school was restructuring. While teaching, he continued to play locally in New York City, but held his steady job for two years as a teacher. This momentary side-step from his music career was quickly recovered when he began attracting attention from the agency of Bramson Entertainment. Bramson Entertainment connected him with several major cruise ships and landed him a headliner position on Holland America, Renaissance Cruises, Crystal Harmony, Crystal Symphony, and the Asuka. He went on to perform as a headliner on cruise ships from 1999 to 2011, performing 2 one-hour shows a week in over 72 countries. He was approached by manager Gerrard W. Purcell known as \\"Jerry Purcell\\", who decided to take on Bogart. Jerry Purcell discovered such well-known artists as Al Hirt, Maya Angelou, Eddy Arnold, and Jay Leno. Jerry Purcell helped Bogart achieve his goal of composing songs, culminating in Bogart's recording of Jazz Ballet for Solo Clarinet written by Bogart and produced by Arabesque Records. Bogart has a CD on the New Orleans Record Company, entitled Rick Bogart. He maintains a long- standing contract with Arabesque Records in New York since 2008. Bogart also recorded music for films including the 1999 made for HBO TV movie Earthly Possessions and Love in the Time of Money. Bogart was the feature of a documentary produced by Jim Markovic entitled When the clarinet swings, which is played in television markets worldwide. He was also featured in the documentary entitled Sandy Jordan's World of Jazz and Cabaret. Bogart was featured in the 2013 documentary Mr. Jazz: Louis Armstrong by Italian filmmaker Michele Cinque, produced by MRF5 in collaboration with Louis Armstrong House Archive in New York. Bogart began collaborating with the Amy Winehouse Foundation and Amy Winehouse's father Mitch Winehouse. Mitch Winehouse makes regular appearances with the Rick Bogart Trio in New York, and Bogart also performs with that same trio. Bogart performed for the University of Donetsk, in the Ukraine and the Kiev Opera House sponsored by the AMS Corporation. Bogart was the featured performer of a major charity event in December 2010 for Arts and Tourism at the Plaza Hotel. The event was sponsored by NYC & Company and George Fertitta and co-chairman Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg honoring Terry Lundgren, Diane von Furstenberg, and Anna Wintour. Additionally, he has performed at a concert at the headquarters of the United Nations, with a special question & answer session with the U.N. Society Jazz Band.

It was aired on May 15, 2013. The episode was written by Ben Karlin based on a story by Danny Zuker and it was directed by Alisa Statman. Plot Phil (Ty Burrell) gets a new RV after selling a house and he wants to go to Yellowstone National Park for the summer, so he takes everyone on a test-drive just to get a taste of what the trip will be like. Claire (Julie Bowen) believes that the trip with an RV is not a really good idea because she knows that having all the kids together in the same place can easily turn into a disaster. Without saying anything to Phil, since she is always the one saying \\"no\\" to his ideas, she lets him discover it by himself. Things though are not going the way she had in mind. In the meantime, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) tries to find his backpack that he thinks he has left in Luke's (Nolan Gould) room. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) breaks-in the house along with him and Jay (Ed O'Neill) to search for it. Instead of that, Gloria and Jay end up snooping through Phil and Claire's stuff, something that they also do later at Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron's (Eric Stonestreet) house since Manny remembers that his backpack is not in Luke's room but at Mitch and Cam's house instead. While snooping around, they find out that they were not invited to a games' night and they start wondering why Mitch and Cam would not invite them. What they do not know is that they were invited but Manny forgot to give them the invitation. Meanwhile, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) participates at a gymnastics competition and she is doing great. Cam and Mitch's competitive spirits, though, make the parents of the other kids turn on them.

While at Georgetown, Hudson served as Director of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies intermittently for over twenty years, most recently from 2007 to 2010.Center for Contemporary Arab Studies story Education Michael C. Hudson received his Bachelor of Arts from Swarthmore College in 1959 and his Master of Arts and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University in 1960 and 1964, respectively. In 1961, he received a Certificate in Arabic from Princeton University. While studying for his PhD at Yale, Hudson specialized in comparative politics and international relations with his advisor, the renowned political scientist Karl W. Deutsch. His dissertation was entitled \\"Political Change in Lebanon: 1943-1963,\\" which would be the basis for his first book The Precarious Republic: Political Modernization in Lebanon.Michael C. Hudson, \\"About\\" Career While conducting fieldwork in Lebanon for his doctoral dissertation, Hudson taught history at the American Community School in Beirut from 1962-1963. Also while completing his doctoral degree, he served as an instructor at Swarthmore College, from 1963-1964. Upon completing his studies at Yale University, Hudson became Assistant Professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York, from 1964-1968, and then an Associate Professor (tenured), from 1968-1970. In 1970, he became Associate Professor in the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University. He remained at SAIS until 1975, when he co-founded the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) at Georgetown University with a distinguished group of academics, including Hisham Sharabi, John Ruedy, Ibrahim Oweiss, Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, and Dean Peter F. Krogh. Hudson served as the director of CCAS from 1976-1989, and directed it again in 2000, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010.Center for Contemporary Arab Studies \\"Academics\\" In 2010, Hudson became the Director of the Middle East Institute (MEI) and Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Hudson was the first director of MEI, which was founded in 2007 as an autonomous research institute within NUS. He continues to direct MEI today. Hudson is also Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University.Middle East Institute, National University of Singapore \\"About MEI\\" In January 2015, he was appointed as the Kuwait Foundation Visiting Scholar at Harvard Kennedy School's Middle East Initiative. He is leading a study group at the Kennedy School on \\"Rethinking the Arab State: The Collapse of Legitimacy in Arab Politics.\\" \\"Middle East Initiative\\" During the course of his career, Hudson has served on numerous boards and committees related to the fields of political science and Middle East studies. He was a founding member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, and served as President of the association from 1986-87. He has served on the editorial boards of the International Journal of Middle East Studies, the Journal of Arab Affairs, and Cambridge University Press's \\"Middle East Library\\" series. He has also served as a manuscript evaluator for over a dozen academic journals. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the National Council on US-Arab Relations and the Board of Trustees of the American Institute for Pakistan Studies. Furthermore, he has served as an external evaluator for Middle East studies programs at the University of Utah, the University of Virginia, and Kuwait University. He has also served on committees within the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. Academic Work In addition to his distinguished record of establishing and directing premier centers for Middle East studies (CCAS and MEI), Hudson has been an authoritative scholar of contemporary Middle East politics. His most notable contributions are on the problem of political legitimacy in the Arab world, as set out in his seminal work Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy.Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977. He has identified and explored the legitimacy 'deficits' of various Arab governments, focusing on cultural, institutional, and leadership sources of legitimacy. He argues that the question of participation is key to legitimacy, an issue borne out by the Arab uprisings beginning in 2011.‚ÄúAwakening, Cataclysm, or Just a Series of Events? Reflections on the Current Wave of Protest in the Arab World,‚Äù in The Dawn of the Arab Uprisings: End of an Old Order? edited by Bassam Haddad, Rosie Bsheer and Ziad Abu-Rish, London: Pluto Press, 2012. Further, new information technologies and social media have invigorated civil societies in these countries.For example: ‚ÄúInformation Technology, International Politics and Political Change in the Arab World,‚Äù Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies (Amman, Jordan) 4:2 (Autumn/Winter 2002). Hudson has also contributed to the scholarship on politics in divided societies, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and regional integration and conflict in the Middle East. On politics in divided societies, he has taken Lebanon as an ongoing case study (see his book The Precarious Republic), critiquing the theory of consociationalism and advocating the deconstruction rather than the institutionalization of sectarianism in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region, despite the recent apparent resurgence of sectarian polarization.The Precarious Republic: Political Modernization in Lebanon, New York: Random House, 1968; a publication of the Harvard Center for International Affairs; reissued with new preface in 1985 by Westview Press, Boulder, CO. On U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hudson contends that a Pax Americana for the Middle East is illusory, owing to the U.S.'s unbalanced approach to the Palestine-Israel conflict, the negative consequences of military interventions, and the failure to maintain soft power and capitalize on a legacy of good will.For example: ‚ÄúTo Play the Hegemon: Fifty Years of US Policy Toward the Middle East.‚Äù Middle East Journal, 50:3 (Summer 1996): 329-43. He asserts that \\"Imperial America\\" has been driven by dysfunctional domestic pressures and poor decision-making, and has lately suggested that the so-called \\"American decline\\" in the Middle East might not be a bad thing for all concerned. Dealing with questions of regional integration and conflict in the greater Middle East, Hudson has explored the interplay between 'rationalist' classical international relations theory approaches and 'sociological' approaches that focus on the domestic decision-making arena.For example: ‚ÄúRethinking Political Culture Explanations of Arab Authoritarianism and Democratization,‚Äù in Political Liberalization and Democratization in the Arab World: Theoretical Perspectives, edited by Bahgat Korany, Paul Noble, and Rex Brynen, Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1995. Influenced in his academic training by Kenneth Waltz on the one hand and Karl W. Deutsch on the other, Hudson has argued against theoretical stovepiping; understanding integrative and conflict tendencies requires acknowledgement of Waltz's 'third image' approach as well as Deutsch's 'social mobilization approach.'For example: ‚ÄúSocial Mobilization Theory and Arab Politics,\\" in From National Development to Global Community: Essays in Honor of Karl W. Deutsch, edited by Richard L. Merritt and Bruce M. Russett, London: Allen and Unwin, 1981. As a professor at Georgetown University and elsewhere, Hudson has taught courses on comparative politics, international politics, comparative politics of the Middle East, Middle East international politics, Lebanese politics, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict, an introduction to social science, networked cultures and networked politics, Yemeni politics, U.S. policy in the Middle East, and politics in divided societies. Hudson is frequently consulted by news organizations for interviews and guest appearances to discuss political developments in the Middle East. Furthermore, he regularly contributes to the media through opinion editorials and short essays. Some of these outlets include Al-Jazeera English, Jadaliyya, Foreign Policy, Singapore's Middle East Insights, The Washington Post, Lebanon's The Daily Star and Al-Mustaqbal, the International Herald Tribune, and others.List of op-eds \\"Media and Opinion\\" Much of Hudson's academic work has been supported by competitive grants and fellowships.

The grape has a long history in the region and was one the varieties planted in 1775 by architect and engineer Luigi Vanvitelli in the fan-shaped Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard created for the royal palace of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies (Ferdinand IV of Naples) in Caserta.Terre del Principe \\"Pallagrello\\" Accessed: June 30th, 2013Anna Russo \\"Il Pallagrello, eccellente e versatile vino regale\\" (Italian) Supereva.

Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 761‚Äì762 Allen Lane 2012 Despite having similar names and both varieties originated in Campania, Pallagrello bianco is not a color mutation of the red Campanian wine grape Pallagrello nero though DNA profiling has not determined yet if the two varieties are closely related. DNA analysis has ruled out a relationship with another white Campanian wine grape, Coda di Volpe, which is known under the synonym Pallagrello and has similar looking \\"fox tail-shaped\\" grape clusters. History and name Pallagrello bianco was one of the grape varieties included by architect Luigi Vanvitelli in his 1775 Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard for the royal palace at Caserta. Ampelographers believe that Pallagrello bianco is likely native to Campania and originated in what is now the province of Caserta somewhere between the communes of Piedimonte Matese and Alife. The grape was traditionally made as a straw wine with the name Pallagrello being derived from the Italian word pagliarello which refers to the straw mat that Pallagrello bianco were laid on after harvest to dry out before fermentation. The first written records of the grape date back to the late 18th century under the synonym Pallarelli. Under another old synonym, Piedmonte bianco, Pallagrello bianco was one of the varieties included in the fan-shaped Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard created in 1775 by architect Luigi Vanvitelli for King Ferdinand's royal palace at Caserta. Planted on sloping terrain in the San Leucio frazione near the palace, the vineyard was planted in a semicircle design subdivided into 10 segments (or \\"fan blades\\") each planted to a different grape variety. Like many Italian grape varieties, plantings of Pallagrello bianco sharply declined in the decades following the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century and the economic devastation of the World Wars of the early 20th century. The variety was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1990s, along with Pallagrello nero, by a local winemaker growing in an abandoned Campanian vineyard. Viticulture and relationship to other grapes Pallagrello bianco is a mid to late ripening grape variety that has a natural tendency to be very low yielding. The grape has good resistance to many viticultural hazards including to botrytis bunch rot which lent itself well to the production of late harvest wines. Clusters of Pallagrello bianco tend to resemble the bush tail of a fox, larger at the top and tapering down to a point. This is a trait shared by another Campanian wine grape, Coda di Volpe, whose name means literally \\"fox tail\\". At one point the two grapes were thought to be the same variety but DNA analysis in the early 21st century conclusively demonstrated that the two varieties are distinct and unrelated. DNA evidence was also able to distinguish Pallagrello bianco from the Emilia-Romagna grape Pignoletto (which is often confused, itself, for the Oriveto wine grape Grechetto). Pignoletto is grown in Campania under the synonym Pallagrello di Caserta but has no known relationship to Pallagrello bianco. Even though both varieties likely originated in the same part of Campania and the two grapes have historically been linked by synonyms and association, ampelographers have determined that Pallagrello bianco is not a color mutation of Pallagrello nero (in the same way that, for example, Pinot blanc is a color mutation of Pinot noir) though DNA profiling has yet to determine exactly how the two grapes may be related. Wine regions While Pallagrello bianco is thought to have originated somewhere between the communes of Piedimonte Matese and Alife in the north eastern reaches of the province of Caserta, today plantings of the grapes are more likely to be found further south in the province around communes like Caiazzo. Today Pallagrello bianco is grown almost exclusively in the Campania region, particularly in the province of Caserta where it has a long historical association with. While plantings of the grape have only recent been revived, some hectares of Pallagrello bianco can be found in a few communes along the Volturno river, Caiazzo, Castel Campagnano and Castel di Sasso. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Pallagrello bianco tends to make wines with a similar profile to the Rh√¥ne wine grape Viognier with aroma notes of peaches and apricot along with moderate acidity and high potential alcohol levels. While often blended the grape can be made in a varietal style that is produced both in unoaked or stainless steel tanks of barrel fermented like Chardonnay. Synonyms Over the years, Pallagrello bianco has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Pallarelli, Pallagrella bianca, Pallagrello di Avellino, Pallarella and Piedimonte bianco.

Friends began to notice signs of domestic abuse, such as bruises on Jones' body, and overhearing phone conversations between Jones and Hutt where Hutt verbally abused her. He would frequently call her to check up on her when she was with friends.Murder trial hears of first date between victim, accused, CBC News, Ottawa, May 14, 2013 Before the couple's planned September 2007 wedding, friends planned a formal intervention, begging Jones to call it off, but when it didn't work, backed out of her wedding party. Two years later, Jones's weight had dropped from 162 pounds to 101 pounds.Fedio, Chlo√©,‚ÄòMonster‚Äô Ottawa husband found guilty of first-degree murder in death of wife tortured ‚Äòbeyond comprehension‚Äô, National Post, Toronto, June 10, 2013 Hutt was emotionally and financially dependent on Jones. Hundreds of notes found in her home reveal Hutt‚Äôs Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde nature ‚Äî in one calling Jones a ‚Äúterrible wife,‚Äù in another insisting, ‚ÄúYou are my angel.‚Äù Jones, previously frugal, was preparing to file for bankruptcy after she had indulged Hutt with his desires for a truck, an ATV, a snowmobile, a snowboard and other items. Several months before Jones's death, oozing burns on her arms appeared, seeming to have become infected, but Jones reportedly refused medical attention. Murder Jones was found, dead, on a mattress made of couch pillows, in the basement of her house on December 6, 2009. Hutt admitted to dousing Jones with boiling water, but waited 11 days, after she was no longer breathing, to call 911. Though Hutt claimed Jones was alive and talking three hours before he called 911, forensic evidence indicated that she had died up to 12 hours before the call.Fedio, Chlo√©, Donna Jones ‚Äòlikely‚Äô shot with pellet gun after scalding, murder trial hears, Ottawa Citizen, May 31, 2013 Hutt claimed at first that Jones had fallen into a fire pit, then later that he had accidentally burned his wife 11 days earlier with a pot of boiling waterGillis, Megan, ‚ÄòMonster‚Äô Mark Hutt slowly killed Donna Jones, Ottawa Sun, June 7, 2013 and had tried to treat her at home after she refused to go to the hospital. About 40% of Jones's body had been burned.Crown closes case in Mark Hutt murder trial, CBC News, Ottawa, May 31, 2013 Although Jones spoke to a handful of people on the phone after the scalding, including her mother, she didn't tell anyone she was hurt nor call 911 herself. The Crown attorney argued Jones was protecting Hutt because of a ‚Äútrauma bond‚Äù. Friends of Jones made a third-party complaint to police alleging Hutt‚Äôs abuse the day after Jones was scalded, but it was left uninvestigated until after her body was found. Trial During the autopsy, 29 pellets from an air rifle were found lodged in Jones's skin. Forensic pathologist Christopher Milroy testified that the gun must have been fired from the short distance of a few feet for the pellets to have penetrated the skin. Some pellets were in Jones's body for quite some time and he said Jones showed signs of lead poisoning, although the level was not high enough to poison her. She was likely shot with at least two of those pellets after the scalding. She also had nine fractured ribs, a broken nose, two black eyes and many cuts, bruises and scrapes on her head, knees and legs. Milroy said these injuries were caused after Jones was burned on November 24, 2009. Jones's body had other injuries including seven calloused ribs, which suggested an earlier fracture likely caused by kicks, as well as two recent rib fractures, a broken left finger, fractured right wrist and an earlier forearm break known as a \\"nightstick fracture\\", caused by a blow to the arm raised in a defensive position. Joel Fish, medical director of the burn unit of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, testified as a burn expert. According to Fish, had Jones received proper medical treatment, she would have had a \\"virtually 100 per cent\\" chance of survival. Hutt's defence lawyer Lorne Goldstein did not contest that Hutt abused Jones, but pointed out that her many broken bones, bruises and cuts did not cause her death. Goldstein conceded that Hutt had tortured Jones \\"beyond comprehension\\". The defence presented no witnesses. Hutt pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of criminal negligence causing death. The Crown rejected his plea and argued he was guilty of first-degree murder. A jury took less than a day to deliberate and on June 7, 2013, found Hutt guilty of first-degree murder. Life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years, the maximum penalty in Canada, is the automatic sentence.Gillis, Megan, 'Evil' Mark Hutt found guilty of murdering wife with boiling water, Toronto Sun, June 7, 2013 References Category:Criminal investigation Category:Canadian murder victims Category:2000s murders in Canada Category:2009 murders in North America Category:2009 crimes in Canada Category:Violence against women in Canada Category:People murdered in Ontario Donna Jones Category:2009 in Ontario Category:2000s in Ottawa Category:Crime in Ottawa Category:Uxoricides Category:Female murder victims ","title":"Murder of Donna Jones"},{"id":"39756531","text":"Pandoraea apista is a Gram-negative, catalase-positive, aerobic, non-spore- forming, motile bacterium with a single polar flagellum, of the genus Pandoraea.International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology http://ijsb.sgmjournals.org/content/50/2/887.full.pdfeol http://eol.org/pages/98285/overviewJournal of Medical Microbiology http://eprints.nuim.ie/4084/1/KK_Virulence.pdf The Strain CCUG 38412 was isolated from the sputum of a cystic fibrosis patient in Denmark.International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology http://ijsb.sgmjournals.org/content/50/2/887.full.pdf Pandoraea apista can cause lung disease, such as chronic lung infections, in patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis.BioInfBank Libraay http://lib.bioinfo.pl/paper:14520728 Etymology Pandoraea apista is named from Pandora's box and the Greek word apistos which means disloyal or treacherous.Journal of Clinical Microbiology http://jcm.asm.org/content/44/3/833.full References External links *Type strain of Pandoraea apista at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Burkholderiales ","title":"Pandoraea apista"},{"id":"39756536","text":"Oulun Luistinseura beat Jyv√§skyl√§n Seudun Palloseura in the 2014 Bandyliiga final at Raksila Artificial Ice Rink Raksila is a District of the city centre area of Oulu, Finland.

It was first published in 2013. The novel serves as a prequel to the Alex Rider series but mainly focuses on the childhood of the assassin who appears in many of the books, Yassen Gregorovich. Plot Shortly after the Science Museum scene in Stormbreaker, Yassen Gregorovich receives an order to kill Alex Rider. The connection the two of them share prompts Yassen to recall his past. In the past, Yassen is a young boy in a small Russian village named Estrov. His parents work at a nearby fertilizer factory that secretly develops chemical weapons for the Russian government. He is forced to flee his home after an accident at the factory contaminates the whole village with a deadly strain of anthrax, which had been genetically modified to spread much faster than it would in normal conditions. Yassen's parents escape from the factory and give him the only sample of antidote before they advise him to flee to Moscow and seek Misha Dementyev, a friend of Yassen's father. Yassen escapes into the forest with his best friend Leo Tretyakov as attack gunships sent by the Russian authorities destroy the village, to contain the outbreak and cover up the development of the chemical weaponry. They narrowly avoid a band of soldiers ordered to hunt down all the survivors of the Estrov disaster, by escaping through a narrow sewage pipe, and later find shelter in an old construction hut. Leo dies of the disease that night and Yassen continues on alone, narrowly avoiding getting caught by the police and escaping onto a train for Moscow. Yassen finds Dementyev in Moscow University, but far from helping him, Dementyev calls the police. He is aware that Yassen is a loose end regarding the chemical weapons development. Yassen evades arrest and joins a gang of petty thieves who had pickpocketed him earlier and later persuades them to rob a flat owned by Vladimir Sharkovsky, a wealthy businessman whom Yassen overheard Dementyev talking to on the phone. As the smallest of the gang, Yassen is chosen to crawl through a fortochka and let the other members into the house, but Sharkovsky unexpectedly returns to the flat and captures Yassen. Sharkovsky decides to let Yassen live and work as a food taster due to the recent death of the previous one, and forces him to play a game of Russian Roulette with a single bullet, of which Yassen is extremely reluctant but he survives. After making two unsuccessful attempts to escape, Yassen spends the next three years at Sharkovsky's estate, serving as his food taster as well as a general laborer. One night, he learns that Sharkovsky had been responsible for the deaths of his parents and subsequent destruction of his village, having cut corners regarding safety at the factory to increase profit, and vows to kill him. One day, a Scorpia assassin, Grant, infiltrates the compound and shoots Sharkovsky, supposedly killing him. Yassen talks Grant into letting him escape with him, and the two meet up with Julia Rothman, one of the commanders of Scorpia. It is revealed that Sharkovsky in fact survived the attempt on his life, and Grant is subsequently killed by Rothman for his failure. Rothman offers to let Yassen join Scorpia: her rationale is that his past has been erased by the Soviet authorities, and thus no records of him exist anywhere else in the world, making it extremely difficult, if not totally impossible, for authorities to track him down. Yassen agrees, his only other option being to return to Russia, where Sharkovsky's people will no doubt be looking for him. Yassen spends the next four months at Scorpia's training facility on the island of Malagosto before being given his first contract, which he is unable to carry out. Scorpia then decides to pair him up with John Rider, Alex Rider's father and an MI6 double agent within Scorpia. The pair work two contracts together. During the first contract, John saves Yassen's life, expresses doubt that Yassen has it in him to be a killer, and suggests that he give up if he does not want to be one. The second contract takes place in Paris, where Yassen again hesitates to kill the target, and admits to John that he does not want to be an assassin. As John and Yassen wait in an airport ‚Äì Yassen planning to take a plane to Berlin and vaporize ‚Äì Yassen discovers a gadget from MI6 in John's luggage, and subsequently discovers his true allegiance. Feeling betrayed from this revelation, guessing that John has warned Scorpia about his defection in an attempt to weaken them further, Yassen abandons his original plans and returns to Sharkovsky's estate, using the skills he learned from Scorpia to infiltrate the place and confront Sharkovsky. He reveals his true identity, as well as Sharkovsky's role in influencing his life, before playing Russian Roulette, this time with five bullets in the revolver, seeing it as his last chance to leave the path of a killer. Yassen once again survives, and kills Sharkovsky. He resolves to become a professional killer to prove John's beliefs about him wrong. The final chapter takes place during the last chapter of Stormbreaker. Yassen kills Herod Sayle, not because of orders from Scorpia as he had claimed to Alex (though he believes they would eventually have wanted him killed), but so that he could talk with John Rider's son. Yassen chooses to disregard Scorpia's order to kill Alex to repay John for saving his life, and tells Alex not to become a spy, since he still feels that he has a chance at a normal life.

Throughout his life, Del Vecchio shared his practice of medicine with the sport, giving impetus to college sports activities, especially baseball, being an advocate for young people so they could also enjoy the sport that he grew up with and loved. Born in Charallave, Miranda, Del Vecchio was the son of Clemente Del Vecchio, Italian merchant, and Enriqueta Pasquali, of Italian- Venezuelan origin. After attending primary school in his hometown, he moved with his parents to Caracas, where he attended high school and entered the Central University of Venezuela. After graduating as a surgeon in 1943, he specialized in cardiology and hospital administration, serving as a physician in the Venezuelan oil industry from 1945 through 1988. (Spanish) In 1962 Del Vecchio created, along with former ballplayer Luis Zuloaga, the corporation Criollitos de Venezuela; a baseball development program committed to preparing of all social classes and backgrounds with the skills necessary to succeed in life and become responsible, productive citizens in their community. (Spanish) For over half a century, this corporation has been a renowned source not only of professional players who have shown their skills in Major League Baseball, among others Bobby Abreu, Bo D√≠az, Andr√©s Galarraga, Freddy Garc√≠a, Pablo Sandoval, Luis Sojo and Omar Vizquel, but also of prominent citizens in different fields of national development. During his tenure with the Criollitos, Del Vecchio covered roles of manager, coach, scorekeeper and groundskeeper. He also offered free medical services to all members of the corporation and was its president from its founding until 1977. In the same year, he was appointed by the International Amateur Baseball Association as a chairman commissioner for the development of youth baseball worldwide. In addition, Del Vecchio served as advisor and consultant to the Venezuelan organizing committee of the IX Pan American Games held in Caracas in 1983, and was included in the Venezuelan National Sports Council in 1989. He also collaborated with the newspaper El Universal, where he published the results of his researches related to sports medicine, a specialty in which he became a pioneer in organizing programs and courses. Del Vecchio died in 1990 in Caracas, at the age of 73, due to natural causes. In 2005, he was enshrined in the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their second class.

Averitt was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 at the age of 19, most likely acquired as a result of a rape she experienced living and modeling in Spain. She began her career working in the office of Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia from 1990 to 1993. Averitt started working for the AIDS Survival Project in 1993. She was an early advocate for women with HIV and for reducing stigma associated with the disease in order to improve access to care. In 1995, Averitt launched the Women‚Äôs Information Service and Exchange (WISE) the first US-based organization to focus on HIV/AIDS treatment information and advocacy for women. In 2000, Averitt completed a hike of the entire length of the Appalachian Trail called ‚ÄúTrekking with AIDS‚Äù to raise awareness about HIV and the reality that it can affect anyone, and to celebrate 12 years of successfully living with HIV. In 2001, Averitt decided to have children and in 2002 authored an article called \\"HIV and Pregnancy: Tough Choices and the Right to Choose\\" about her choice. In 2002 and 2004, Averitt delivered two healthy HIV negative children.Delivery In 2002, she and her brother Richard co-founded The Well Project, a nonprofit organization that \\"works to improve the lives of women living with HIV and AIDS, and to change the course of the AIDS pandemic by focusing on treatment and prevention for women.\\" Much of Averitt's work has focused on including women and people of color in research on HIV/AIDS and on advancements in HIV treatment and care.

From 2006 to 2009 Averitt was a driving force behind the GRACE Study, the first HIV treatment study in the US to successfully enroll a majority of women. The GRACE Study helped show that HIV positive women and people of color will participate in clinical studies and that they experience different barriers to treatment than men. In July 2007, Averitt received a Women Leading Global Change Award from the World YWCA for her leadership in the HIV and AIDS pandemic. In 2010, Averitt was named to the Presidential Advisory Committee on HIV/AIDS (PACHA).

It was published in her collection of stories named A Curtain of Green (1941). The work was inspired by a photograph taken by Welty that depicts a woman ironing at the back of a post office. The story is classified as an example of Southern realism. \\"Why I Live at the P.O.\\" is one of Welty's most popular and frequently anthologized stories.  Plot  Sister, the narrator, who is also a protagonist, begins her story when her younger sister, Stella-Rondo, comes back home after separating from her husband ‚Äì Mr. Whitaker. Stella brings with her a child, Shirley-T. and despite a great resemblance to Papa-Daddy (grandfather of Sister and Stella-Rondo) she claims the girl is adopted. Sister does not believe her and that begins a series of quarrels between the siblings, whose relationship has been tough since Stella caused Sister's and Mr. Whitaker's breakup and married the man. Later that day, Stella lies to Papa-Daddy about Sister suggesting that he should shave his beard, to which he is very devoted. That causes a tension between him and his granddaughter. Then Uncle Rondo enters the house and borrows Stella's negligee, which makes her comment upon his look to Sister. A while later the sisters have another argument concerning Shirley-T. ‚Äì Sister claims that a girl cannot speak, which angers Stella and also makes Mama upset. Mother even suggests that Sister should apologize to Stella, but she refuses and quarrels with Mama. As a result, Stella convinces Uncle Rondo that Sister suggested that he looks like a fool in her pink kimono. This lie aggravates the uncle; he believes that Sister really vilified him and that makes him mad at her. As everyone in the house is angry with Sister because of Stella-Rondo's lies, she leaves her home and moves to the post office, where she works.  Characters  *Sister ‚Äì narrator and protagonist; she is the U.S. postmistress in the very small town of China Grove, Mississippi, working in a tiny one-person post office.

Daunizeau, \\"Generalised Filtering,\\" Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010. It is based on a variational principle of least action, formulated in generalized coordinates.B Balaji and K Friston, \\"Bayesian state estimation using generalized coordinates,\\" Proc. SPIE, p. 80501Y , 2011 Note that the concept of \\"generalized coordinates\\" as used here differs from the concept of generalized coordinates of motion as used in (multibody) dynamical systems analysis. Generalized filtering furnishes posterior densities over hidden states (and parameters) generating observed data using a generalized gradient descent on variational free energy, under the Laplace assumption. Unlike classical (e.g. Kalman-Bucy or particle) filtering, generalized filtering eschews Markovian assumptions about random fluctuations. Furthermore, it operates online, assimilating data to approximate the posterior density over unknown quantities, without the need for a backward pass. Special cases include variational filtering, dynamic expectation maximization and generalized predictive coding.  Definition  Definition: Generalized filtering rests on the tuple (\\\\Omega,U,X,S,p,q): * A sample space \\\\Omega from which random fluctuations \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega are drawn * Control states U \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} ‚Äì that act as external causes, input or forcing terms * Hidden states X:X \\\\times U \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} ‚Äì that cause sensor states and depend on control states * Sensor states S:X \\\\times U \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} ‚Äì a probabilistic mapping from hidden and control states * Generative density p(\\\\tilde{s},\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}\\\\mid m) ‚Äì over sensory, hidden and control states under a generative model m * Variational density q(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}\\\\mid \\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) ‚Äì over hidden and control states with mean \\\\tilde{\\\\mu} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} Here ~ denotes a variable in generalized coordinates of motion: \\\\tilde{u} = [u,u',u,\\\\ldots]^T = Generalized filtering = The objective is to approximate the posterior density over hidden and control states, given sensor states and a generative model ‚Äì and estimate the (path integral of) model evidence p(\\\\tilde{s}(t)\\\\vert m) to compare different models. This generally involves an intractable marginalization over hidden states, so model evidence (or marginal likelihood) is replaced with a variational free energy bound.R P Feynman, Statistical mechanics.

This means that free-energy can be expressed in terms of the variational mean K Friston, J Mattout, N Trujillo-Barreto, J Ashburner, and W Penny, \\"Variational free energy and the Laplace approximation,\\" NeuroImage, vol. 34, no. 1, pp. 220-34, 2007 (omitting constants): : F=G(\\\\tilde{\\\\mu})+\\\\textstyle{1 \\\\over 2}\\\\ln \\\\vert \\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} G(\\\\tilde{\\\\mu})\\\\vert The variational means that minimize the (path integral) of free energy can now be recovered by solving the generalized filter: : \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}}=D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}-\\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} F(\\\\tilde{s},\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) where D is a block matrix derivative operator of identify matrices such that D\\\\tilde{u}=[u',u,\\\\ldots ]^T = Variational basis = Generalized filtering is based on the following lemma: The self-consistent solution to \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}}=D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}-\\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} F(s,\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) satisfies the variational principle of stationary action, where action is the path integral of variational free energy : S=\\\\int dt\\\\, F(\\\\tilde{s}(t),\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}(t)) Proof: self-consistency requires the motion of the mean to be the mean of the motion and (by the fundamental lemma of variational calculus) : \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} = D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}\\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} F(\\\\tilde{s},\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) = 0\\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\delta_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} S=0 Put simply, small perturbations to the path of the mean do not change variational free energy and it has the least action of all possible (local) paths. Remarks: Heuristically, generalized filtering performs a gradient descent on variational free energy in a moving frame of reference: \\\\dot-D\\\\tilde=-\\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} F(s,\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}), where the frame itself minimizes variational free energy. For a related example in statistical physics, see Kerr and Graham W C Kerr and A J Graham, \\"Generalised phase space version of Langevin equations and associated Fokker-Planck equations,\\" Eur. Phys. J. B., vol. 15, pp. 305-11, 2000. who use ensemble dynamics in generalized coordinates to provide a generalized phase-space version of Langevin and associated Fokker-Planck equations. In practice, generalized filtering uses local linearization T Ozaki, \\"A bridge between nonlinear time- series models and nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems: A local linearization approach,\\" Statistica Sin., vol. 2, pp. 113-135, 1992 over intervals \\\\Delta t to recover discrete updates : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta \\\\tilde{\\\\mu} & =(\\\\exp (\\\\Delta t\\\\cdot J)-I)J^{-1}\\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}}  J & =\\\\partial_{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} =D-\\\\partial _{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} F(\\\\tilde{s},\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) \\\\end{align} This updates the means of hidden variables at each interval (usually the interval between observations).  Generative (state-space) models in generalized coordinates  Usually, the generative density or model is specified in terms of a nonlinear input-state-output model with continuous nonlinear functions: : \\\\begin{align} s & = g(x,u)+\\\\omega_s  \\\\dot & = f(x,u)+\\\\omega_x \\\\end{align} The corresponding generalized model (under local linearity assumptions) obtains the from the chain rule : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{s} & =\\\\tilde{g}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_s   s & =g(x,u)+\\\\omega_s  s' & =\\\\partial_x g\\\\cdot x'+\\\\partial_u g\\\\cdot u'+\\\\omega'_s  s & =\\\\partial_x g\\\\cdot x+\\\\partial_u g\\\\cdot u+\\\\omega_s  & \\\\vdots  \\\\end{align} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{x}} & =\\\\tilde{f}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_x   \\\\dot{x} & =f(x,u)+\\\\omega_x  \\\\dot{x}' & =\\\\partial_x f\\\\cdot x'+\\\\partial_u f\\\\cdot u'+\\\\omega'_x  \\\\dot{x}& =\\\\partial_x f\\\\cdot x+\\\\partial_u f\\\\cdot u+\\\\omega_x  & \\\\vdots \\\\end{align} Gaussian assumptions about the random fluctuations \\\\omega then prescribe the likelihood and empirical priors on the motion of hidden states : \\\\begin{align} p\\\\left( \\\\tilde{s},\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}\\\\vert m \\\\right) & = p\\\\left( \\\\tilde{s}\\\\vert \\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u},m \\\\right)p\\\\left( {D\\\\tilde{x}\\\\vert x,\\\\tilde{u},m} \\\\right)p(x\\\\vert m)p(\\\\tilde{u}\\\\vert m)  p\\\\left( \\\\tilde{s}\\\\vert \\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u},m \\\\right) & = \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\tilde{g}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}),\\\\tilde{\\\\Sigma}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u})_s)  p\\\\left( {D\\\\tilde\\\\vert x,\\\\tilde,m} \\\\right) & = {\\\\mathcal{N}}(\\\\tilde{f}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}),\\\\tilde{\\\\Sigma}(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u})_x )  \\\\end{align} The covariances \\\\tilde=V\\\\otimes \\\\Sigma factorize into a covariance among variables and correlations V among generalized fluctuations that encodes their autocorrelation: : V=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\ddot{\\\\rho}(0) & \\\\cdots  0 & -\\\\ddot{\\\\rho}(0) & 0 \\\\ & \\\\  \\\\ddot{\\\\rho}(0) \\\\ & 0 \\\\ & \\\\ddot{\\\\ddot{\\\\rho}}(0) \\\\ & \\\\  \\\\vdots \\\\ & \\\\ & \\\\ & \\\\ddots \\\\  \\\\end{bmatrix} Here, \\\\ddot(0) is the second derivative of the autocorrelation function evaluated at zero. This is a ubiquitous measure of roughness in the theory of stochastic processes.D R Cox and H D Miller, The theory of stochastic processes. London: Methuen, 1965. Crucially, the precision (inverse variance) of high order derivatives fall to zero fairly quickly, which means it is only necessary to model relatively low order generalized motion (usually between two and eight) for any given or parameterized autocorrelation function.  Special cases  = Filtering discrete time series = When time series are observed as a discrete sequence of N observations, the implicit sampling is treated as part of the generative process, where (using Taylor's theorem) : [s_1 ,\\\\dots ,s_N ]^T = (E\\\\otimes I)\\\\cdot \\\\tilde{s}(t): \\\\qquad E_{ij} =\\\\frac{(i-t)^{(j-1)}}{(j-1)!} In principle, the entire sequence could be used to estimate hidden variables at each point in time. However, the precision of samples in the past and future falls quickly and can be ignored. This allows the scheme to assimilate data online, using local observations around each time point (typically between two and eight). = Generalized filtering and model parameters = For any slowly varying model parameters of the equations of motion f(x,u,\\\\theta ) or precision \\\\tilde(x,u,\\\\theta ) generalized filtering takes the following form (where \\\\mu corresponds to the variational mean of the parameters) : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\mu} & = \\\\mu'  \\\\dot{\\\\mu'} & = -\\\\partial_\\\\mu F(\\\\tilde{s},\\\\mu )-\\\\kappa \\\\mu' \\\\end{align} Here, the solution \\\\dot=0 minimizes variational free energy, when the motion of the mean is small. This can be seen by noting \\\\dot={\\\\dot}'=0\\\\Rightarrow \\\\partial_{\\\\mu } F=0\\\\Rightarrow \\\\delta_{\\\\mu } S=0. It is straightforward to show that this solution corresponds to a classical Newton update.K Friston, K Stephan, B Li, and J. Daunizeau, \\"Generalised Filtering,\\" Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010.  Relationship to Bayesian filtering and predictive coding  = Generalized filtering and Kalman filtering = Classical filtering under Markovian or Wiener assumptions is equivalent to assuming the precision of the motion of random fluctuations is zero. In this limiting case, one only has to consider the states and their first derivative \\\\tilde=(\\\\mu ,{\\\\mu }'). This means generalized filtering takes the form of a Kalman-Bucy filter, with prediction and correction terms: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\mu} & = \\\\mu'-\\\\partial_\\\\mu F(s,\\\\tilde{\\\\mu})  \\\\dot{\\\\mu'} & =-\\\\partial_{\\\\mu'} F(s,\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) \\\\end{align} Substituting this first-order filtering into the discrete update scheme above gives the equivalent of (extended) Kalman filtering.K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, \\"DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems,\\" Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008 = Generalized filtering and particle filtering = Particle filtering is a sampling-based scheme that relaxes assumptions about the form of the variational or approximate posterior density. The corresponding generalized filtering scheme is called variational filtering.K J Friston, \\"Variational filtering,\\" Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 747-66, 2008. In variational filtering, an ensemble of particles diffuse over the free energy landscape in a frame of reference that moves with the expected (generalized) motion of the ensemble. This provides a relatively simple scheme that eschews Gaussian (unimodal) assumptions. Unlike particle filtering it does not require proposal densities‚Äîor the elimination or creation of particles. = Generalized filtering and variational Bayes = Variational Bayes rests on a mean field partition of the variational density: : q(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u},\\\\theta \\\\dots \\\\vert \\\\tilde{\\\\mu},\\\\mu )=q(\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u}\\\\vert \\\\tilde{\\\\mu})q(\\\\theta \\\\vert \\\\mu )\\\\dots This partition induces a variational update or step for each marginal density‚Äîthat is usually solved analytically using conjugate priors. In generalized filtering, this leads to dynamic expectation maximisation.K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, \\"DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems,\\" Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008 that comprises a D-step that optimizes the sufficient statistics of unknown states, an E-step for parameters and an M-step for precisions. = Generalized filtering and predictive coding = Generalized filtering is usually used to invert hierarchical models of the following form : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{s} & =\\\\tilde^1 (\\\\tilde{x}^1,\\\\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_s^{(1)}  \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{x}}^{(1)} & =\\\\tilde{f}^{(1)}(\\\\tilde{x}^{(1)},\\\\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_{x}^{(1)}  \\\\vdots  \\\\tilde{u}^{(i-1)} & =\\\\tilde{g}^{(i)}(\\\\tilde{x}^{(i)},\\\\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_u^{(i)}  \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{x}}^{(i)} & =\\\\tilde{f}^{(i)}(\\\\tilde{x}^{(i)},\\\\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\\\\tilde{\\\\omega}_x^{(i)}  \\\\vdots \\\\end{align} The ensuing generalized gradient descent on free energy can then be expressed compactly in terms of prediction errors, where (omitting high order terms): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}}_u^{(i)} & =D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}^{(u,i)}-\\\\partial_u \\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}^{(i)}\\\\cdot \\\\Pi^{(i)}\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}^{(i)} -\\\\Pi^{(i+1)}\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_u^{(i+1)}  \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}}_x^{(i)} & =D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}^{(x,i)}-\\\\partial_x \\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}^{(i)}\\\\cdot \\\\Pi^{(i)}\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}^{(i)}   \\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_u^{(i)} & =\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}_u^{(i-1)} -\\\\tilde{g}^{(i)}  \\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_x^{(i)} & =D\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}_x^{(i)} -\\\\tilde{f}^{(i)} \\\\end{align} Here, \\\\Pi^{(i)} is the precision of random fluctuations at the i-th level. This is known as generalized predictive coding [11], with linear predictive coding as a special case.  Applications  Generalized filtering has been primarily applied to biological timeseries‚Äîin particular functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological data. This is usually in the context of dynamic causal modelling to make inferences about the underlying architectures of (neuronal) systems generating data.J Daunizeau, O David, and K E Stephan, \\"Dynamic causal modelling: a critical review of the biophysical and statistical foundations ,\\" Neuroimage, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 312-22, 2011 It is also used to simulate inference in terms of generalized (hierarchical) predictive coding in the brain.K Friston, \\"Hierarchical models in the brain,\\" PLoS Comput.

Most Azerbaijani-France have immigrated to France from the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran.  History  The migrations of Azerbaijanis to France began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are mostly asylum-seekers or political refugees, who came to France following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Strengthening of France's position in Europe has accelerated the migration of the Azerbaijanis to this country since the end of the 19th century. Azerbaijani millionaires such as Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev, Musa Nagiyev, Shamsi Asadullayev and French businessmen created business together in France. After the decline of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, France was one of the 10 countries where Azerbaijani migrants settled. Famous Azerbaijanis such as Alimardan Topchubashov, Ali bey Huseynzade, Jeyhun Hajibeyli, Umbulbanin settled in France. After the declaration of independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the establishment of bilateral relations between France and Azerbaijan affected the activities of the Azerbaijani diaspora. The books \\"Karabagh history and the present period\\", \\"Karabagh\\" (collection of articles), \\"Nagorno-Karabagh\\", \\"History of Nagorno-Karabakh and its documents\\" were published in France.  The Azerbaijani-French Youth Association (AFYA)  The Azerbaijani-French Youth Association (AFYA) was established in 2003 by a group of Azerbaijani students studying in Paris. The first president of the association was Babek Ismailov, who studied in Paris at that time. In the following years, Mirvari Fataliyeva was the head of the organization. More than 50 AFYA members are Azerbaijanis, French and foreigners living in France. The main purpose of AFYA is to strengthen friendly relations between Azerbaijan and France, as well as to support the development of economic, scientific and cultural relations, along with sharing information about Azerbaijani culture, history, successes and even problems. The organization carries out activities and projects in Paris, as well as in different cities of France. Chairman of Azerbaijani-French Youth Association is Vusala Mammadzadeh.

Much of Wales is rural countryside and sheep are seen throughout the country. The woollen industry in Wales was a major contributor to the national economy, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's exports in 1660. Sheep farms are most often situated in the country's mountains and moorlands, where sheepdogs are employed to round up flocks. Sheep are also reared, however, along the south and west coasts of Wales. In 2017 there were more than 10 million sheep in Wales and the total flock made up nearly 33% of the British total. In 2011 sheep farming accounted for 20% of agriculture in Wales.Welsh Government, Support for lamb producers: Statement by Alun Davies AM, 29 January 2013. Retrieved 6 July 2013 Historical development A Badger Face Welsh Mountain ewe on Flat Holm Sheep and lambs near Brecon in early spring Sheep farming is an ancient husbandry activity in rural parts of Wales where the climate and soil conditions were not suitable for growing crops other than oats. The activity is documented from mediaeval times, by which time white sheep probably imported by the Romans had interbred with native dark-fleeced types to produce varieties of Welsh Mountain sheep. Initially, sheep were bred for their milk and fleeces, rather than their meat. By the 13th century, sheep farming in Wales had become a major industry and source of income, largely from wool, much of which was exported. Large flocks of sheep were owned by Cistercian abbeys and monasteries, such as those at Strata Florida, Margam, Basingwerk and Tintern. H.E.

Retrieved 27 June 2013 The woollen industry in Wales was a major contributor to the national economy, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's exports in 1660. However, large-scale sheep rearing on the higher moors of Wales, such as those in Denbighshire, is only believed to have developed within the last 300 years. Sheep farmers often practised transhumance, with part of each household moving to live in the hills with the sheep during the summer; later, their seasonal hillside hafods or dwellings became permanent homes. In the past, grazing rights were determined by local courts. Historically, Welsh sheep were shorn twice in the year. Besides the regular shearing in May or June, the wool was clipped close about the neck and forequarters at Michaelmas, otherwise all of it would have been lost before the following summer in the wanderings of the animal among the thickets and furze in search of food during winter and spring. Glamorganshire mountain sheep wandered over the countryside from early times, some being horned and others being polled. In the 1840s, Youatt described the sheep of Glamorganshire: \\"Some are nearly white, and others are between a dirty white and a perfect black. The head is small; the neck long, erect, and delicate; the fore-quarters light, with narrow breast and shoulders; the sides flat; the back and loins narrow; the legs slight and long; the animals possessing considerable agility. The fleece weighs about . On the Gelligaer and Eglwysilan mountains the quality of the wool is fine; but on the hills lying on the western side of the Taff valley it is kempy, which deteriorates its value. The breech wool is still more hairy and coarse.\\" Dre-fach Felindre in the Teifi valley became known as the \\"Huddersfield of Wales\\" when the wool industry was prosperous there. In the 1840s, the hills of Montgomeryshire included flocks from the low country. Towards the south and west, a smaller white-faced breed was more prevalent while in the north-east a black-faced native breed was found. The breed in the valleys had been improved, principally by sheep from Shropshire. The sheep on the higher grounds weighed about 10 lbs. the quarter, while those in the valleys weighed 12 to 14 lbs. The lambing season at that time was in March and lambs were shorn in August. There were fewer sheep in Denbighshire and Flintshire, particularly in Flintshire, than in any of the other counties, and these were mixed with English breeds. Their weight varied between 10 and 20 lbs. per quarter, and the fleece from 2 to 5 lbs. Husbandry and economics Sheep at Ty'n-y-Cornel farm, near Tregaron in West Wales Newport, which closed in 2009 after 165 years of trading Twenty percent of all agricultural work is made up by sheep farming. There are over 11 million sheep in the entire country. Breeds favoured by modern wool producers, which originate from Wales, include the Badger Face Welsh Mountain, the Balwen Welsh Mountain and the Black Welsh Mountain. Sheep farming in the mountains of Wales is an arduous task, particularly when the traditional techniques of farming are followed. The activities of sheep farming start with growing grass on the meadows, buying hay from external sources and stacking them. The season starts with the birth of the lambs during spring and continues with feeding, caring, shearing and transportation to market centers, maintaining the fencing around the pens, and taking care of the deserted young lambs or injured lambs. Farms are mostly under small farmers and it is one individual who bears most responsibilities. The sheep farmers' best support is the sheepdog for moving the flocks to better ground or to wintering areas in the valleys, and even in giving them organic treatments in the form of injections and treatments. In recent years, sheep farming has become less profitable to the farmers for many reasons including the falling prices of lamb meat, weather conditions, loss of more than 1-million breeding ewes between 2001 and 2009 and global warming. The threat of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union is also a fear for the farmers of Welsh as they anticipate \\"doom the Welsh sheep industry\\". The EU support to the Welsh rural community is reported to be of the order of about half a billion euros a year. The loss on this account could be an additional burden of ¬£40 per lamb on the farmers. Government support has been sought in the way of subsidies and technical support. Disaster struck parts of Wales in March 2013 when the coldest weather experienced in 50 years caused the deaths of many sheep and lambs and hardship to sheep farmers.

However, this requires the removal of unwanted vegetation such as wild plants.Why Britain's barren uplands have farming subsidies to blame, Guardian 22 May 2012, retrieved 5 July 2012 The writer George Monbiot claims that sheep farming practices and grazing prevents natural trees and shrubs from growing and the subsequent fauna associated with such ecosystems flourishing, and that sheep compact the soil contributing to a cycle of flood and drought, thereby restricting the productivity of more fertile lands downstream. Wales imports seven times as much meat as it exports despite 76% of the land in Wales being devoted to livestock farming.Sheepwrecked, George Monbiot, 30 May 2012, Retrieved 5 July 2012 The RSPB's State of Nature report found that 60% of animal and plant species in Wales have declined over the last 50 years and 31% have declined strongly with farming practices being blamed for loss of habitats. RSPB, State of Nature: Wales However, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was \\"unfair to conveniently lay the blame on farming\\".

The Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway were in the process of building the station when the company was absorbed into the newly created Cambrian Railways in 1864. The Cambrian itself was incorporated into the GWR at the grouping of 1923. In 1948 both of Whittington's lines and stations became part of the Western Region of British Railways.

It is a Grade I listed building. It was probably built by Sir Richard Mill Bt between 1711 and 1760 and was originally of a quadrangular plan with an open courtyard in the middle. The courtyard was later roofed over. The house is built of coursed Hythe sandstone in 2 storeys with an attic and has a 7-bay south-facing frontage with 5 hipped dormers. History The manor of Woolbeding belonged to William Aylyng in 1567 and passed by marriage to the Grey family. The Greys owned the manor until Margaret Grey married Sir John Mill in 1652. It then passed down in the Mill family until 1791, the manor house having been remodelled by Sir Richard Mill in the meantime. In 1791 the Rev. Sir Charles Mill, 8th Baronet sold the house and estate to Lord Robert Spencer, the youngest son of the third Duke of Marlborough, who immediately made a number of alterations to the house, including the roofing over of the central courtyard. The house then descended in the Spencer family via his stepdaughter Diana Bouverie to her daughter, who bequeathed it to the Lascelles family. They in turn made it over in the late 1940s to the National Trust, who leased it to businessman, philanthropist and art collector Simon Sainsbury until his death in 2006. His partner Stewart Grimshaw remained in occupation afterwards.

The culture, evolution, and history of women who were born, live, and are from the continent of Africa reflect the evolution and history of the African continent itself. Numerous short studies regarding women's history in African nations have been conducted.For a brief guide to the historiography see HIST 4310, Twentieth Century African Women's History by J. M. ChadyaKathleen Sheldon, Historical dictionary of women in Sub-Saharan Africa (Scarecrow press, 2005). Many studies focus on the historic roles and status of women in specific countries and regions, such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria Bolanle Awe, Nigerian women in historical perspective (IbDn: Sankore, 1992). Lesotho, and sub-Saharan Africa.Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, African Women: A Modern History (1997)M.J. Hay and Sharon Stitcher, Women in Africa South Of the Sahara (1995). Recently, scholars have begun to focus on the evolution of women's status throughout the history of Africa using less common sources such as songs from Malawi, weaving techniques in Sokoto, and historical linguistics. The status of women in Africa is varied across nations and regions. For example, Rwanda is the only country in the world where women hold more than half the seats in parliament‚Äî51.9% as of July 2019, but Morocco only has one female minister in its cabinet. Significant efforts towards gender equality have been made through the creation of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, which encourage member states to end discrimination and violence against women. With the exception of Morocco and Burundi, all African states have adopted this charter. However, despite these strides towards equality, women still face various issues related to gender inequality such as disproportionate levels of poverty and education, poor health and nutrition, lack of political power, limited workforce participation, gender-based violence, female genital mutilation, and child marriage.  History of African women  Mural of a Makurian noblewoman protected by Virgin Mary, 12th century Female soldier of the PAIGC liberation army playing cards, Guinea-Bissau, 1973 The study of African women's history emerged as a field relatively soon after African history became a widely respected academic subject. Historians such as Jan Vansina and Walter Rodney forced Western academia to acknowledge the existence of precolonial African societies and states in the wake of the African independence movements of the 1960s, although they mainly focused on men's history. Ester Boserup, a scholar of historical economics, published her groundbreaking book, Women's Role in Economic Development in 1970. This book illustrated the central role women had played in the history of Africa as economic producers and how those systems had been disrupted by colonialism. By the 1980s, scholars had picked up threads of African women's history across the continent. For example, George Brooks' 1976 study of women traders in precolonial Senegal, Margaret Jean Hays' 1976 study of how economic change in colonial Kenya affected Luo women, and Kristin Mann's 1985 study on marriage in Nigeria. Over time, historians have debated the role and status of women in precolonial vs. colonial society, explored how women have dealt with changing forms of oppression, examined how phenomena like domesticity became gendered, unearthed women's roles in national struggles for independence, and even argued that the category of \\"woman\\" in some cases cannot be applied in precolonial contexts. Women have been shown to be essential historical, economic and social actors in practically every region of Africa for centuries.  Culture  =In the home= From the 1940s until Morocco's declaration of independence from the tutelage of France in 1956, Moroccan women lived in family units that were \\"enclosed households\\" or harems. The tradition of the harem lifestyle for women gradually ended upon Morocco's independence from France in 1956. The traditional division of labour in Senegal saw Senegalese women as responsible for household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare. They were also responsible for a large share of agricultural work, including weeding and harvesting for common crops such as rice. In recent decades, economic change and urbanization has led to many young men migrating to the cities like Dakar. Rural women have become increasingly involved in managing village forestry resources and operating millet and rice mills. =In society= Gender discrimination was solidified across the continent during the colonial era. In the pre-colonial period, women held chieftaincies in their own right, and some tribes even had traditions to pass dynastic rights to exclusively male titles to royal descendants through the matrilineal line (e.g., Asanteman, Balobedu, Ijawland, Wolof kingdoms). Colonialism eroded the power of these chieftancies and traditions, and reinforced what was by then an already ascendant patriarchy thereafter. This was met by fierce opposition, most famously in the case of the Abeokuta women's revolt in Nigeria. Following independence, sovereign states solidified the gender norms and class structures inherited from their colonial predecessors, as both the first and second generations of African administrations failed to restore women's traditional powers. This led to more opposition, and over the course of the past couple of decades there has been a significant improvement in the situation. Titled females throughout Africa's history include Fatim Beye, Ndoye Demba and Ndate Yalla Mbodj of Senegal, Moremi, Idia, Amina, Orompoto, Nana Asma'u and Efunroye Tinubu of Nigeria, Yaa Asantewaa of Ghana, Yennenga of Burkina Faso, Hangbe of Benin, Makeda, Zawditu and Embet Ilen of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Nandi of South Africa and Hatshepsut of Egypt. All are hailed as inspirations for contemporary African women. Many of Africa's contemporary titled women are members of the African Queens and Women Cultural Leaders Network, a voluntary organization.  Education  = Sub-Saharan Africa = Although sub-Saharan African countries have made considerable strides in providing equal access to education for boys and girls, 23% of girls do not receive a primary education. Factors such as a girl's social class and mother's education heavily influence her ability to attain an education Without easy access to schools, mothers are often the first and perhaps only form of education that a girl may receive. In C√¥te d'Ivoire, girls are 35 times more likely to attend secondary school if their father graduated from college. With 40% of girls getting married before the age of 18 in sub-Saharan Africa, girls are often forced to drop out of school to start families. Early marriage reinforces the cultural belief that educating daughters is a waste of resources because parents will not receive any economic benefit once their daughter is married to another family. This leads to the phenomena known as son-preference where families will choose to send their sons to school rather than their daughters because of the economic benefit that having educated sons affords the family. In addition, girls that do attend school tend to attend schools that are of lower quality. Bad quality schools are characterized by their lack of course offerings and weak preparation for the workforce. Another issue in education systems is the segregation of school subjects by gender. Girls are more likely to take domestic science and biology courses, whereas boys are more likely to take math, chemistry, engineering, and vocational training. According to UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 58.8% of women are literate in 2018. However, literacy rates within sub-Saharan Africa vary a lot from Chad having a 14% female literacy rate in comparison to Seychelles 96%. South Africa According to Rowena Martineau's analysis on the educational disparities between men and women in South Africa, women have been historically overlooked within the education system. Some barriers women face in receiving education is that their education is less prioritized than their brothers, sexual assault is a common fear and widespread occurrence, and the social pressures to become married and start a family all hinder women's opportunity to become educated. Furthermore, women choose to study nursing and teaching above any other profession, which further excludes them from entering the higher-paying jobs in STEM, that also contributes to gender inequality. Sierra Leone Since the founding of Sierra Leone in 1787, the women in Sierra Leone have been a major influence in the political and economic development of the nation. They have also played an important role in the education system, founding schools and colleges, with some such as Hannah Benka-Coker being honoured with the erection of a statue for her contributions and Lati Hyde-Forster, first woman to graduate from Fourah Bay College being honored with a doctor of civil laws degree by the University of Sierra Leone. Angola In Angola, groups like the Organization of Angolan Women were founded in order to provide easier access to education and voting ability. The organization also advocated the passing of anti-discrimination and literacy laws. = North Africa = The seven countries‚ÄîAlgeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara‚Äîthat make up North Africa have unique educational environments because of their relative wealth and strong Islamic faith. Gender norms and roles are very strictly defined to protect a woman's honor and modesty, which have inadvertently become barriers to women receiving equal education as men as women are expected to stay at home and raise a family. These gender expectations devalue women's education and bar girls access to education. As a result, North African countries such as Egypt and Morocco have higher illiteracy rates for women than other countries with similar GDPs. Similar to sub-Saharan Africa, women are disproportionately over-represented in the professions of teaching, medicine, and social welfare. Gender stereotypes are further reinforced by the fact that only 20% of women are part of the labor force. This creates a negative cycle wherein women are expected to stay at home, barring them from further educational opportunities, and creating barriers for women to gain the education and skills necessary to find gainful employment. Morocco Morocco's female literacy rate is 65%, which is still significantly lower than North Africa's female literacy rate of 73%. Moroccan women live under a strong framework of acceptable gender roles and expectations. Agnaou's study in 2004 found that for 40% of illterate women, the greatest obstacle for women to become literate were their parents. Due to societal views of \\"literacy\\" and \\"education\\" as masculine, there is no strong policy push to educate women in Morocco. There have been various literacy campaigns run by the government such as the creation of the Adult Literacy Directorate in 1997 and the National Education and Training Charter. These literacy campaigns have had varying success in reducing illiteracy due to limited funding, lack of human resources, and cultural inertia.  Politics  = North Africa = Algeria Algeria is regarded as a relatively liberal nation and the status of women reflects this. Unlike other countries in the region, equality for women is enshrined in Algerian laws and the constitution. They can vote and run for political positions. Libya Since independence, Libyan leaders have been committed to improving the condition of women but within the framework of Arabic and Islamic values. Central to the revolution of 1969 was the empowerment of women and removal of inferior status.Peter Malcolm, Elizabeth Losleben, Libya, Marshall Cavendish, 2004. , , pp. 73, 76, 78. In Niger, many of the laws adopted by the government of Niger to protect the rights of Nigerien women are often based on Muslim beliefs. Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Women in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are women who were born in, who live in, or are from the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in the region of the Western Sahara. In Sahrawi society, women share responsibilities at every level of its community and social organization.Donati, Simone. Saharawi, Terra Project Photographers. Article 41 of the Constitution of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ensures that the state will pursue \\"the promotion of women and [their] political, social and cultural participation, in the construction of society and the country's development\\". = West Africa = Benin The state of the rights of women in Benin has improved markedly since the restoration of democracy and the ratification of the Constitution, and the passage of the Personal and Family Code in 2004, both of which overrode various traditional customs that systematically treated women unequally. Still, inequality and discrimination persist. Polygamy and forced marriage are illegal but still occur. Nigeria The freedom and right for women in Africa to participate in leadership and electoral processes differs by country and even ethnic groups within the same nation. For example, in Nigeria, women in Southern Nigeria had the right to vote as early as 1950 and contested for seats in the 1959 Nigerian elections, whereas women in Northern Nigeria could not vote or contest until 1976 . = Central Africa = Democratic Republic of the Congo Women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have not attained a position of full equality with men, with their struggle continuing to this day. Although the Mobutu regime paid lip service to the important role of women in society, and although women enjoy some legal rights (e.g., the right to own property and the right to participate in the economic and political sectors), custom and legal constraints still limit their opportunities. From 1939 to 1943, over 30% of adult Congolese women in Stanleyville (now Kisangani) were so registered. The taxes they paid constituted the second largest source of tax revenue for Stanleyville. Rwanda Claire Wallace, Christian Haerpfer and Pamela Abbott write that, in spite of Rwanda having the highest representation of women in parliament in the world, there are three major gender issues in Rwandan society: the workloads of women, access to education and gender-based violence. They conclude that the attitudes to women in Rwanda's political institutions has not filtered through to the rest of Rwandan society, and that for men, but not women, there are generational differences when it comes to gender-based attitudes. = East Africa = Seychelles Women in Seychelles enjoy the same legal, political, economic, and social rights as men.Tartter, Jean R. \\"Status of Women\\".

Mothers tend to be dominant in the household, controlling most current expenditures and looking after the interests of the children. Unwed mothers are the societal norm, and the law requires fathers to support their children. Men are important for their earning ability, but their domestic role is relatively peripheral. Older women can usually count on financial support from family members living at home or contributions from the earnings of grown children. South SudanA group of women from Limuru in central Kenya, 2010. The women of the Republic of South Sudan had also been active in liberation causes, by \\"providing food and shelters\\" to soldiers and by \\"caring for children\\" and by \\"caring for wounded heroes and heroines\\" during their political struggle prior to the country's independence. An example was their formation of the Katiba Banat or women's battalion.Mabor, Beny Gideon. Women and Political Leadership in Africa: A demand In South Sudan transitional democracy, Sudan Tribune, 22 April 2013. Sudan Sudan is a developing nation that faces many challenges in regards to gender inequality. Freedom House gave Sudan the lowest possible ranking among repressive regimes during 2012. South Sudan received a slightly higher rating but it was also rated as \\"not free\\". In the 2013 report of 2012 data, Sudan ranks 171st out of 186 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI). Sudan also is one of very few countries that are not a signatory on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Despite all of this, there have been positive changes in regards to gender equality in Sudan. As of 2012, women comprise 24.1% of the National Assembly of Sudan. Uganda The roles of Ugandan women are clearly subordinate to those of men, despite the substantial economic and social responsibilities of women in Uganda's many traditional societies. Women are taught to accede to the wishes of their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sometimes other men as well, and to demonstrate their subordination to men in most areas of public life. Even in the 1980s, women in rural areas of Buganda were expected to kneel when speaking to a man. At the same time, however, women shouldered the primary responsibilities for childcare and subsistence cultivation, and in the twentieth century, women have made substantial contributions to cash-crop agriculture.Uganda country study. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1990). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.  Workforce participation  Women in Africa are highly active whether that is within the sphere of formal or informal work. However, within the formal sphere, African women hold only 40% of formal jobs which has led to a labor gender gap of 54%. According to Bandara's analysis in 2015, this labor gender gap is equivalent to a US$255 billion loss in economic growth because women cannot fully contribute to economic growth. In addition, women earn on average two-thirds of their male colleague's salaries. Some of the challenges African women face in finding formal work are their general lack of education and technical skills, weak protection against gender discriminatory hiring, and double burden of work with the expectation to continue housekeeping and childbearing. Most of Africa's food is produced by women, but each female farmer produces significantly less food than male farmers because female farmers do not have access to the same land, fertilizers, technology, and credit to achieve maximum efficiency. For example, women in Ethiopia and Ghana produce 26% and 17% less food than their male counterparts as a result of resource inequality. The Senegalese government's rural development agency aims to organize village women and involve them more actively in the development process. Women play a prominent role in village health committees and prenatal and postnatal programs. In urban areas, cultural change has led to women entering the labour market as office and retail clerks, domestic workers and unskilled workers in textile mills and tuna-canning factories. Non- governmental organizations are also active in promoting women's economic opportunities in Senegal. Micro-financing loans for women's businesses have improved the economic situation of many. In May 2011 in Djibouti, Director of Gender for the Department of Women and Family, Choukri Djibah launched the project SIHA (Strategic Initiative for the Horn of Africa) which is designed to support and reinforce the economic capacity of women in Djibouti, funded with a grant from the European Union of 28 Million Djibouti francs.  Notable women  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia was Africa's first woman president. Since Sirleaf's election to office, Joyce Banda of Malawi, Ameenah Gurib of Mauritius and Sahle-Work Zewde of Ethiopia have also risen to the presidencies of their respective countries. Some other political leaders (in no particular order) are Sylvie Kinigi of Burundi, Luisa Diogo of Mozambique, Agathe Uwilingiyimana of Rwanda, Maria das Neves of Sao Tome and Principe, Aminata Toure of Senegal and Saara Kuugongelwa of Namibia. All have held the office of prime minister of her country. In addition to political leaders, African nations boast many female artists, writers, and activists. For example: Sao Tome and Principe's lyricist of the national anthem and renowned writer, Alda do Espirito Santo; South African singer and apartheid activist, Miriam Makeba; Nigerian novelist and speaker,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Ethiopian entrepreneur of SoleRebels, Bethlehem Alemu; and environmental activist, Wanjira Mathai.  Gender-based violence  Woman from liberated Guinea-Bissau, 1974 = Legal protections for sexual assault = In Benin, enforcement of the law against rape, the punishment for which can be up to five years in prison, is hampered by corruption, ineffective police work, and fear of social stigma. Police incompetence results in most sexual offenses being reduced to misdemeanors. Domestic violence is widespread, with penalties of up to 3 years in prison, but women are reluctant to report cases and authorities are reluctant to intervene in what are generally considered private matters. = Female genital mutilation = In some African cultures, female genital mutilation is seen as traditional passage into womanhood and a way to purify a woman's body. There are four levels of female circumcision: Type 1 involves the complete removal of the clitoris, Type 2 goes beyond Type 1 and removes the labia minora as well, Type 3 stitches the vagina after a Type 2 procedure, and Type 4 is any mutilation of vaginal tissue. The procedure is very painful and often practiced without proper medical equipment and hygiene procedures leading to a high risk of infection and chronic pain. Female genital mutilation is practiced in Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Egypt, Cameroon, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Central African Republic, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone among others. = Femicide = Femicide is broadly defined as the \\"intentional murder of women,\\" which includes honor killings, dowry killings, sexual orientation hate crimes, and female infanticide. According to a 2013 study by Abrahams, South Africa has the fourth highest rate of female homicide with 12.9 per 100,000 women being murdered by intimate partners in South Africa annually. With a rate of 7.5/100,000 women, women in South Africa are four times more likely to be murdered with a gun than a woman in the United States.

History Beginning in 1913 Mount Tamalpais had hosted theatrical performances known as Mountain Plays in a natural amphitheatre setting 2,000 feet above sea level. In the first two decades the performances were accessed by hiking or riding the winding Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway. The railway was led by businessman Sidney B. Cushing and, in 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps began construction of a 4,000-seat stone amphitheater that was named the Sidney B. Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in his honor. The amphitheatre was constructed by the corps using massive serpentine rocks. In 1967 the venue hosted the two-day Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival, widely considered the first outdoor rock festival ever held during the Summer of Love. It hosts theatrical productions each year in the spring. In response to the California State Parks budget crisis, on June 21, 2013, the Tamalpais Conservation Club hosted a benefit concert, Mount Tam Jam, with profits going towards funding a broad range of needed resources, from ranger and maintenance services to equipment for trail and bridge restoration and more expedient emergency response. This first eight-hour festival resulted in a sell-out crowd under perfect weather conditions. The musical lineup included Danny Click and the Hell Yeahs, Mike Farris and the Roseland Rhythm Review, Taj Mahal, CAKE and Galactic. The ultimate aim is to make Mount Tam Jam an annual sustainable revenue source, a festive event that honors the spirit of the mountain and its legacy while preserving and protecting Mt. Tam and the Amphitheater for generations to come. Since 2016, Roots & Branches Conservancy has produced Sound Summit, a fundraiser for Mount Tamalpais State Park, at the Amphitheatre, raising $100,000 in total for 2016 and 2017.http://citysound.bohemian.com/tag/roots-branches-conservancy/ External links *Official \\"Mountain Play\\" website - including schedules and ticket sales References Category:Amphitheaters in California Category:Mount Tamalpais Category:Music venues in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Theatres in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in California Category:Tourist attractions in Marin County, California ","title":"Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre"},{"id":"39756873","text":"Dentarius Locke (born December 12, 1989) is an American track and field sprinter.

Although there has been considerable controversy over linguistic identity in Moldova, the Moldovan and Romanian languages are virtually identical and share a common literary history. Moldovan literature, therefore, has considerable overlap with Romanian literature.  History  The creation of Moldovan written literature was preceded by a rich folklore that emerged in the 10th and 11th centuries CE: calendrical and family ritual poetry (Plugusorul), fairy tales, heroic epics (Hydra, Toma Alimos, The Knight Gruia Grozovan, Mihul Kopilul, Codreanu, Corbea), historical songs (Duca Vode, Buzhor, Tobultok), folk legends, proverbs, popular sayings, lyrical songs, ballads (The Sun and the Moon, The Rich Man and the Pauper, Dolca). The greatest achievement of Moldovan epic-lyric pastoral poetry is the ballad Miori≈£a, various versions of which were found across Romania. The national struggle against the Ottoman occupation is reflected in the ballad The Well of Frost, which was popular not only in the Moldovan principality but also in Wallachia. = The Middle Ages = The first written records appeared in Moldova at the turn of the 10th-11th centuries CE in Old Church Slavonic (or Middle Bulgarian), which was the official language of the church and state until the 7th century, as well as the literary language. In this language appear the significant sacred and historical literature (The Life of St John the New and the preachings of Gregory Tsamblak), a hierarch of the Moldovan church between 1401-1403; anonymous chronicles of the 14th and 15th centuries, as well as those of Makarios, Eftimius, Azarius in the 16th century, and so on. The first Moldovan book was Kazania (interpretations of the Gospels) by the Metropolitan Barlaam (1590-1657) published in 1643. Barlaam's successor, Metropolitan Dosoftei (1624-1693) translated the Psalms in verse in the Romanian language. To Dosoftei is attributed the famous saying Light comes to us from Moscow... (De la Moscova vine lumina...). From the 15th century, Moldovan literature absorbed influences from Latin literature, chiefly propagated by the Dominicans and the Franciscans, as well as southern Slavs (from Serbia and Bulgaria). The first half of the 17th century was marked by the awakening of nationalist consciousness among the Romanians. The Moldovan prince Vasile Lupu established a university, several publishing houses (from 1642), and introduced the first Moldavian legal code, especially laws on serfdom which provided a number of benefits to the big landowning classes. The second half of the 15th century saw the development of historical literature in the Moldovan principality. The chronicles were compiled at the behest and supervision of the rulers, and were intended to glorify their reigns and actions. During the reign of Stefan the Great, an official chronicle was written in the Slavonic language: the original is lost, but its contents have been preserved in five different editions: Anonymous Chronicle, the Putna Monastery Chronicle (in two versions),The first (preserved in the Saltykov Shchedrin Library, St. Petersburg, covers events to 1518, while the other (in the Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR) continues to 1526. The documents chronicle the reign of Stefan. See Mokhov, 1964. a Moldovan-German chronicle, a Russo-Moldovan chronicle and a Moldovan-Polish chronicle.Translated at the end of the sixteenth century from Moldavian court annals that depended on the early 15th century version. See Foot et al. page 342. While all the editions include the reign of Stefan, there are differences and further additions by their scribes. Moldovan chronography in Slavonic continued to develop in the 16th century. Roman Makarios' chronicle, compiled on behalf of Peter Rare»ô, covers historical events occurring between 1504-1551. Eftimius, abbot of the CƒÉpriana monastery, was asked by Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu to continue Makarios' work to include the events of the principality between 1541-1554. The events of the years 1554-1574 were addressed by the monk Azarius, a disciple of Makarios, by decree of Peter the Lame. The fundamental premise of these 16th century chronicles was the establishment of centralised power in Moldova, as well as emphasis on the continuity between Roman and Greek history and Moldavian history.Foot et al, page 342. Azarius was the last representative of the school of court chroniclers. The Annals of Moldova illuminate the period from the 14th through the 18th centuries. They describe the activities and achievements of various princes and monasteries, the chief proponents of Christian culture of the time. From the 17th century, the chronicles began to be written in the Romanian language. The best known chroniclers are Grigore Ureche (1590s-1647), Miron Costin (1633 -1691), Ion Neculce (1672-1745). Moldovan historiography rose to the levels of contemporary European science in the works of Dimitrie Cantemir (1673-1723). Dimitrie Cantemir was the author of one of the most complete histories of the Turks. His History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire (1714) was translated into many European languages. A valuable historical, ethnographic and geographic source is his Description of Moldova (1716). = Modern Era = Only at the end of the 17th and early 18th centuries did a secular literature develop in Moldova. The so-called Transylvanian school promoted the idea of a Romance origin for the Romanian people and their language, an idea that propelled their nationalistic development from the end of the 17th century. This 'Latinate' school included Samuil Micu-Klein (1745-1808), Gheorghe ≈ûincai (1754-1816), Petru Maior (c.1756-1821). In 1780, Samuil Micu-Klein's grammar Elements of Dacio-Romanian Language in Latin was published, while other scientific and historical works include ≈ûincai's Chronicle of the Romanians and other peoples (on which he worked for over thirty years, and which was published posthumously), and Maior's History of the early Romanians in Dacia (1812) and A Conversation on the Beginnings of the Romanian Language between an Uncle and a Nephew (1819). Alexandru Beldiman (1832-1898) wrote the chronicle Tragodia sau mai bine a zice jalnica Moldovei √Ænt√¢mplare dupƒÉ rƒÉzvrƒÉtirea grecilor, a tale of social upheaval during a peasant uprising in 1821 against the boyar landlords. Much of the storytelling of the first half of the 19th century reflected the social struggle between the poor peasantry and the landowning classes in Moldova and Wallachia. Songs celebrating the Hajduk appeared at this time. Bourgeouis literature of the period painted a villainous picture of the hajduks, but in folks songs they were romanticised as heroes and champions of peasant rights. The Moldavian national musical style Doina circulated widely. Among the founders of Moldavian lyric poetry are the father IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu and son Alecu VƒÉcƒÉrescu. They both wrote love songs in the tradition of the ancient Greek poet Anacreon, an extant example being AmƒÉr√¢ta turturea (\\"The Moping Dove\\"). At the beginning of the 19th century, the writers Gheorghe Asachi (founder of the first Moldovan newspaper Romanian Bee in 1829), Alecu Donici, Alecu Russo, Constantin Stamati, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu become famous. KogƒÉlniceanu published the journal Dacia LiterarƒÉ (Literary Dacia), as well as the historical journal Arhiva Rom√¢neascƒÉ in 1840. Along with Vasile Alecsandri and Constantin Negruzzi he published the literary journal Revival, which was soon thereafter closed down by the censors. Negruzzi can be considered the founder of modern Moldovan prose. He was active in the peasant uprising of 1821, fled to Bessarabia where he met, and was subsequently deeply influenced by, Alexander Pushkin. In the second half of the 19th century, Moldovan literature fell under the influence of the middle- class, especially of the French. Latinate influences rising in Transylvania had a considerable following in Moldova and Wallachia. Another source of influence on Moldovan literature was that of the Germans. The noted poet and dramaturge Vasile Alecsandri was active in the national movement for the unification of Moldova and Wallachia, participating in the revolution of 1848, headed the magazines Progress, Literary Dacia, and founded the journal Literary Romania. In 1888, Elena Sevastos published the collection Cantece Moldovenesti (Moldovan songs). Nationalism, aestheticism, and the idealisation of folk art characterised the folklore collections of the time. The critic and politician Titu Maiorescu, on the other hand, was representative of a countervailing conservative strand in the arts. Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, the editor of the gazette Trojan and the satirical journal Cerienok was very popular. Critics noted that in the trans-Prut Moldova and other provinces of Romania, there was beginning a Francophone Romanian culture. At the same time, the 19th century is notable for the establishment of a nationalist literature as well. = Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic = From 1926, the newspaper Plugarul Ro»ôu (Red Ploughman) published in Tiraspol, followed by Pagini literarƒÉ (Literary pages), and then organised by May 1, 1927 into the journal Moldova literarƒÉ, occupied an important corner of Moldovan literature. In April 1927 was organised the Union of Moldovan Soviet Writers (Reseritul, or Sunrise). At the end of 1931, the writers' union in Tiraspol divided two sections: Tinerimea and Ularf. In November, the journal Moldova literarƒÉ reorganised itself into a politico-literary monthly October - an organ for the Union of Writers and the Socio-literary division of the Moldovan scientific committee. From 1930, the pioneering magazine (Leninist Spark) began publication. Dmitrii Milev can be considered the first Soviet writer from the Moldovan Autonomous SSR. In his short stories, Milev described in bright detail the bestiality and terror of Romanian fascism in a Bessarabian village, and the protest and resistance of the peasantry. But Milev also depicted the Bessarabian farmers as an undifferentiated mass that propels individual heroes. The revolutionary movement was shown as spontaneous and without perspective. Some of his works were to some extent or the other pessimistic, albeit veiled. Mihai Andriescu, born in a peasant family in Bessarabia, was a Communist poet, among whose works were Navalire, and Grigore Malini. Teodor Malai, also born in Bessarabia, was a farm-hand, fought in the Civil War, organiser of collective farms, a senior member of the Communist party. He published a collection of poems, O≈£elu jiu in 1929. His oeuvre covered the October Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle, the problems of the establishment of Socialism, the defence of the USSR, and life in the Party and the Komsomol. One of the most energetic drivers of the Moldovan Soviet literature was Samuil Leht≈£ir, an organiser of the Union of Moldovan Soviet Writers and a founder of the literary journal Moldova literarƒÉ. In his early poems (for instance, Poems (1929)) he often imitated the folk style (Doina), in which he attempted to show the revolutionary movements in Bessarabia. Between 1928-1929, he wrote essays of criticism. His collection of poems √én flƒÉcƒÉri (In the flame) came out in 1931, revealing considerable artistic and ideological development. His poetry collection Nikita depicted class struggle in the collective farm. Caderea Epigonilor (The Fall of the Epigones) demonstrates his introduction into socialist realism. To Leht≈£ir is also attributed the beginning of Moldovan dramaturgy. His play Codreanu (1930) depicts moments in the revolution and rebellion of serfs under the leadership of a hajduk. The works of the poet Caftanaki should be noted: the short story Cabanita, the poems Donbasul Alb (White Donbass), Greiler Elevator, Fuljeraria (Snowstorm). Eminent among the Moldavian writers of the period is Markov, whose major works are Ce a cost, nu a mai fi (So it was, but so it shall not be), Lupta (Struggle), the short story collection For Soviet Rule (1930), the poetry collection Cuvintul viu (1930), The Black Valley and others. The poet Leonid Corneanu (1909-1957) is well known for his Tiraspolul (1932), which gives a vivid picture of the Moldovan capital, its perspectives and grand buildings, as well as his extensive collections of Moldovan folk songs (C√¢ntece norodnice moldovene≈üti (1939)). His works were intimately tied to the realities of those times and could be seen as chronicle of the era. Corneanu also played a major role in the creation of a Moldovan children's literature (Pionierii √Æn ≈£eh, 1934). The novelist Ion Canna (1902-1979) published in Moldova literarƒÉ: the satirical story R√¢≈üni≈£a (1926) as well as stories set during the Civil War, the building of Socialism in the countryside, the collectivisation of agriculture. In 1937 came his DouƒÉ √Ænt√¢lniri (Two meetings), which was distinguished by the diversity of themes, descriptions of the new people and a sharp and expressive language. Canna was later to face disgrace and lose his honour as the founder of Soviet Moldovan literature - for plagiarism. Among other prominent writers was D. Batr√¢nsea (Mai sus fƒÉclia ardƒÉ). = Bessarabia = Alexei Mateevici (1888-1917) was one of the foremost Bessarabian poets: his poems Limba noastrƒÉ (Our language), ≈¢ƒÉranii (Peasants), Eu c√¢nt (I sing), ≈¢ara (The Country) being particularly notable. The participants of the underground revolutionary movement and the anti-fascist struggle in Bessarabia were the writers Emilian Bukov (1909-1984) and Andrei Lupan (1912‚Äì92). Among Bukov's interesting collections of poetry are \\"This Sun\\" (1937) and \\"China\\" (1938). This period is the beginning of the literary work of other writers: George Meniuc (1918‚Äì87), Bogdan Istru (1914-1993), T. Nencheva (1913‚Äì41), Liviu Deleanu (1911‚Äì67), Nicolai Costenco (1913‚Äì93 ), A. Robota (1916‚Äì41), G. Adam (1914‚Äì46), Vera Panfil (1905‚Äì61), D. Vetrova (1913‚Äì52), and others. There was a brief spark of Gagauz literature in the 1920s and 1930s in Bessarabia, the single-handed work of a priest Mihail Ciachir (1861-1938), who created the first Gagauz dictionary, grammar, and translated religious works into the language. = Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic = During World War II, several Moldavian authors served in the Soviet Army: Samson ≈ûleahu (1915-1993), Alexandru Lipcan (1908-1977), Lev Barskii (1909-1974). Poetry and journalism flourished. Poems and articles of Emilian Bukov, Bogdan Istru, Andrei Lupan, Liviu Deleanu and George Meniuc were published in the magazine Moldova SocialistƒÉ\\" (Moscow, 1942-44), in central gazettes and journals, as well as being broadcast over the radio. Russian translations of Bukov's I see you, Moldavia (1942) and Spring on the Dniester (1944) were published in Moscow. The post-war period was fruitful for the development of all genres of literature. Bukov gained fame for several children's books: Andrie≈ü (1946), De vorbƒÉ cu cei mici (Speaking to children, 1953), Basm cu cele patru z√¢ne (Story of four banshees, 1972). Other epic works include Lupan's The Forgotten Village (1940) and Face to Face (1945), Istru's Pogorna (1947) and Spring in the Carpathians (1955), Meniuc's Song of the Dawn (1948), Deleanu's Immortal Youth (1950), Kruchenyuk's Mother's Word (1952), which reflected the fight against the Nazi invaders, the collectivization of agriculture in the country, and the struggle for peace. These years also saw the flowering of the poets Iosif Bal≈£an (1923-1975), Constantin Condrea (1920-2009), Petru Zadnipru (1927-1976), Anatol Gujel (1922- ). Critically and popularly acclaimed works included: Ion Dru»õƒÉ's Leaves of Sorrow (1957), Vladimir Be≈üleagƒÉ's Zbor fr√¢nt (Broken flight, 1966), Ariadna Shalar's People and Destinies (1958). The genres of essays and short stories were successfully developed by the above writers as well as Vasile Vasilache, A. Marinat, R. Lunghu. Dramaturgy was an important development in Soviet Moldavia. Works such as Lupan's Light (1948), Bukov's The Raging Danube (1957), Anna Lupan's The Wheel of Time (1959), Rahmil Portnoi's Flightless Birds (1957), Corneanu's The Bitterness of Love (1958), Condrea's Children and Apples (1961) and Dru»õƒÉ's Birds of Our Youth (1972) are prominent. In the 1960s and 1970s appeared fine novels and poetry: Dru»õƒÉ's novel Ballads of the Steppes (1963), Bukov's collection of poems Present day, future day (1965), Lupan's Laws of Hospitality (1966), L. Damian's Roots (1966), Victor TeleucƒÉ's Deer Island (1966), and Grigore Vieru's Poems (1965). There was also an important tradition of translation into the Moldovan language of works in Russian and masterpieces of other world languages. Eminent translators included Alexandru Cosmescu (1922-1989), Yuri Barzhansky (1922-1986), P. Starostin, I. Cre»õu and others. Russian language writers in Moldavia included the novelists L. Mischenko, G. Uspensky, and the poets N. Savostin, V. Izmailov, S. Burlak, Vadim Chirkov. There were also works in the Gagauz language by Dmitri Kara-√áoban (1933-1986) and Dionis Tanasoglu (1922-2006). = Modern Moldova = Since independence, Moldova has continued its literary tradition across genres. Vasile G√¢rne≈£ is in the vanguard of the experimental novel (Martorul, 1988), and Grigore Chiper writes consciously fragmentary quotidian prose. Nicolae Popa's Avionul mirosea a pe»ôte (The Plane Smells Of Fish, 2008) is a postmodern novel that symbolises the peacefulness of his people despite the hardships thrown by history. Dumitru Crudu's MƒÉcel √Æn Georgia (Massacre in Georgia, 2008) is an ironic reflection on the essential unchanging nature of his country, whether Soviet or independent. Emilian Galaicu-PƒÉun (Air with Diamonds) is a contemporary poet called eloquent, assured, politically engaged. The Gagauz language enjoyed a resurgence in the independent republic of Moldova. A weekly newspaper Ana S√∂z√º (Mother tongue) began publication in 1988, and a Gagauz university opened in Comrat in 1991.  Politics and Controversy  Throughout the existence of the Moldovan ASSR and the Moldovan SSR, there was a fierce battle between the so-called Moldovenists and the Romanianists, a schism caused by their attitude towards the linguistic identity of Moldovan - was it a separate language with its own tradition, or was it a derivative of the Romanian literary norm? The battle was fought in the Union of Moldovan Soviet Writers, resulting in several splits and reformations. In the late 1940s, further political manoeuvring was caused by the absorption of Bessarabian writers into the Union, where they were in conflict with the Transnistrians. As a result of the post-Stalin thaw, the Bessarabians were able to impose a Romanian version of the Moldovan language, with the sole exception being the script of the latter, which continued to be Cyrillic. After independence, the modern Moldovan republic switched its script back to Roman. At the same time, there was considerable Russophobia which was reflected in the works of such poets as Petr Kerare (Unwelcome Visitor) and Grigore Vieru, which promoted nationalism among ethnic Moldovans at the cost of the Russian-speaking minority.

He was also a politician. Forssell lived in S√£o Paulo until around age 20. He was a member of the Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica S√£o Paulo, participating in swimming and water polo. He won the Travessia de S√£o Paulo a Nado, contested on the Tiet√™ River, several times, and broke Brazilian and South American records in the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke. In 1927, he moved with his family to Itanha√©m. The family wanted to invest in the cultivation and marketing of bananas, for the land and climate are extremely favorable for this. In 1930 Harry's mother, Lois Forssell, built the municipality's first factory making banana products. State champion and one of the top freestyle swimmers in the country in the 1930s, Forssell got good results and was selected for the Brazilian team that participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He did not win a medal but retains the distinction of having been the first man from Itanha√©m to have participated in the Olympics. After his achievements as a sportsman, Forssell ran for mayor of Itanha√©m in 1947 and was the first mayor elected by direct vote of the people in the city's history. He took office in 1948, when all the assets of the prefecture were the penitentiary (which also functioned as chamber), a cart, and a donkey. The city had just four or five employees. Despite this precarious situation, Forssell oversaw construction of the Benedito Calixto school which replaced the old, crumbling elementary school, then still in use. The new school was inaugurated in December 1951. He enabled the arrival of the first public telephone in the municipality. It opened in 1949, with a call to the State Governor. During his government, city had emancipated. His first term was from 1948 to 1951. He ran for the office of Alderman and served from 1952 to 1955. He ran again for mayor in 1959 and was re-elected. His second term ran from 1960 to 1963. In 2004 his son John Carlos Neto Forssell was also elected mayor of Itanha√©m. Forssell died of natural causes at the Regional Hospital of Itanha√©m on September 15, 2006, at 98 years of age.

The cartoon shares a very similar title with Kounty Fair, another Oswald short released four years prior. Plot Oswald is walking merrily on the road, heading towards the county fair. On his way, the boy beagle is expelled out of the house by a disgruntled father. The father dog roughs up the boy beagle some more before returning indoors. Feeling sorry for his little friend, Oswald decides to take the little dog along. At the fair, Oswald and the boy beagle disguise themselves as a single customer in an attempt to just pay for one ticket. But their cover is blown when they stumble, prompting the ticket seller to shoo them. Annoyed by that employee, the boy beagle assaults the ticket seller, eventually knocking the latter out of the ticket booth. Going further into fair, the boy beagle wishes to board the roller coaster. But when a guard demands for a ticket which he has none, the little dog decides to just harass the guard, momentarily knocking that worker using the spinning bars. Oswald, who tries to take him, would also be knocked down by those bars. Oswald chases the boy beagle into the trousers of a hefty tourist. While the little dog is able to get out of the pants, the rabbit gets stuck. The boy beagle begins pelting Oswald in the head with some baseballs. Oswald then pursues the boy beagle into a high striker which the little dog climbs up. Oswald strikes the lever with a mallet but the boy beagle is able to dodge the bell-hitting mechanism. Oswald strikes the lever once more but harder. The impact of the second hit was so powerful that the high striker collapses. The rabbit then captures the boy beagle in a way that the tiny canine cannot escape. Returning to the house, Oswald hurls the boy beagle back inside. In no time the house starts to rattle violently, giving Oswald the notion that the little dog is getting battered more by the father. It then appears that the one getting the abuse is the father dog who runs away in terror. The angry boy beagle shows up holding a short 2x2 lumber. Frightened, Oswald runs as far as he could. The boy beagle tosses the lumber which lands on Oswald's head, putting the rabbit dazed on the ground.

It was created by David Rees and Brian Spinks from an idea by Robert Green.  Background  On June 6, 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked the existence of PRISM, an electronic surveillance program intended to monitor e-mail and phone call activity in the United States to identify possible terrorist threats, to the newspapers The Guardian and The Washington Post. Cond√© Nast Publications, who produces Wired magazine, said Codefellas would provide \\"comedic relief in light of current events dominating the national news cycle.\\" After Wired joined Cond√© Nast's Digital Video Network, five original web series were announced for Wireds video channel including Codefellas and Mister Know-It- All. Codefellas is Wired's first scripted series.  Production  Codefellas was scripted by Get Your War On cartoonist David Rees and Brian Spinks, who produced Get Your War On for The Huffington Post. Flat Black Films, the animation and software company who worked on the Richard Linklater films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, worked on the rotoscoping and lipsyncing.

The second episode, \\"Meet Big Data\\", premiered on June 26, 2013. The third episode, \\"How to Hack a Website\\", premiered on July 10, 2013. The fourth episode, \\"The AntiSocial Network\\", premiered on July 17, 2013. The fifth episode, \\"Spy vs. Spy\\", premiered on July 24, 2013. The sixth episode, \\"Blackmail at 4:20\\", premiered on July 31, 2013. The seventh episode, \\"25 Reasons the NSA Should Hire Buzzfeed Staffers\\", premiered on August 14, 2013. The eighth episode, \\"How to Kill Your Boss\\", premiered on August 21, 2013. The ninth episode, \\"How to Hack a Telegram\\", premiered on August 28, 2013. The tenth episode, \\"How to Cheat to Win\\", premiered on September 4, 2013. The eleventh episode, \\"Shout to All My Lost Spies\\", premiered on September 11, 2013. The twelfth episode, \\"The Cougar Lies with Spanish Moss\\", premiered on September 18, 2013.  Story  In the first episode, \\"When Topple Met Winters\\", prot√©g√© hacker Nicole Winters (Emily Heller) who works for \\"Special Projects\\", an electronic surveillance governmental agency, receives a call from elderly Special Agent Henry Topple (John Hodgman) informing her that she has just been assigned to him to spy on the general public. In the second episode, \\"Meet Big Data\\", Agent Topple checks up on how Winters is settling into her new job at \\"Special Projects\\". Topple asks Winters about her surveillance of e-mails and in turn reveals his lack of understanding with modern computing. The conversation then trails off into the secret history of how fake mustaches were involved with the United States' national security. In the third episode, \\"How to Hack a Website\\", Agent Topple instructs Winters to hack a website. It is revealed that Topple merely used Winters's hacking expertise to remember the password to his old GeoCities e-mail. After Topple asks what e-mails are in his inbox, Winters finds an urgent message from 1998 on a secret project involving Topple's past partner Logan and a \\"test subject\\". In the fourth episode, \\"The AntiSocial Network\\", Agent Topple calls Winters about a supposed alert from PRISM on a cyberterrorist group called \\"Evite\\" infiltrating their networks and a subsequent attack. In the course of conversation, it is revealed that it is only an invitation from Topple's co-worker Doug for his retirement party described as a \\"big blow-out.\\" Blaming the terror alert from PRISM on boredom, Winters brings up Facebook, a social network. Topple then calls Facebook \\"the smartest way to keep people dumb since we started fluoridating the water.\\" Winters then admonishes Topple for having her to have to fill out a \\"88-J\\" incident form because of revealing classified information so candidly. Since \\"88-J\\" incident forms are only filled out by supervisors, Topple realizes Winters was promoted to become Topple's superior. In the fifth episode, \\"Spy vs. Spy\\", Winters calls Topple back since she was busy with a briefing. As Topple was not invited to the meeting, he passed the time watching telenovelas. Winters complains about his unprofessionalism and reveals that she had not slept well because of a list of troubles the night before. It turns out that the troubles were all perpetrated by Topple's ability to use national security at his disposal as he is still upset over Winters's recent promotion. In the sixth episode, \\"Blackmail at 4:20\\", Topple finds his personal accounts with Walgreens, Amtrak, MCI, and so forth have been hacked because of Winters. In retaliation, Topple orders a \\"toilet water sample\\" and finds that Winters is a drug user, which is grounds for termination. Coming to a compromise, Winters discloses to Topple her secret project: stopping a North Korean computer virus. Per their agreement, Topple gets to collaborate with Winters on the secret project as well as getting full credit for it. In the seventh episode, \\"25 Reasons the NSA Should Hire Buzzfeed Staffers\\", Topple sends Winters a fax of his analysis of the North Korean computer virus called \\"Staxnut\\". As the two converse on the computer virus, it is revealed that the computer virus could replace all American digital content with North Korean flag dancing. Given that North Korea is busy producing flags, there is still time to stop the virus. However, Topple realizes it would wipe out electronic dance music (and other media) he loathes and thus realizes his dilemma. In the eighth episode, \\"How to Kill Your Boss\\", Winters informs Topple that she called Chief Deputy Rollins and that Rollins does not want Topple on the Staxnut project. Annoyed that he is not involved with the project, Topple lists off the people he has killed. In the course of the conversation, Winters receives an alert that the Chief Deputy was murdered.

History Border Guard soldiers at the Berlin Wall in 1989. The Strichtarn was adopted by East Germany in 1965 in service with the National People's Army to replace the Fl√§chentarn, which was adopted in 1958. In East German service, it was known as \\"Kampfanzug 64\\" (). When the pattern was used in South Africa, it's known as \\"rice fleck\\".  Design  Strichtarn was designed with broken vertical red-brown lines on a grey-green field, which was also known as the raindrop pattern. The patterns made for the Strichtarn consisted of Type 1, which was made from 1965 to 1967. The Type 2 was made from 1967 to 1990. The pattern is also seen as helmet covering for the M56 helmet.

Today site of Lilla Adolf Fredriks skola The monogram of √Öhlinska skolan can still be seen on the old building. √Öhlinska skolan (√Öhlin School), or √Öhlinska flickskolan (√Öhlin Girls' School), was a girls' school in Stockholm, Sweden. Active from 1847 to 1939, it was one of the first schools in Sweden that offered serious academic education to female students. History The school was founded by Karin √Öhlin in 1847. It was managed as a private girls' school, initially with only √Öhlin and her sisters as teachers, and expanded from 14 students in 1847 to 45 in 1857, changing localities and expanding its activity as the number of students grew. Eventually, it also included a co-educational primary education school. In 1891, it became a gymnasium for females, and in 1894, it was given the right to administer the studentexamen for its students. It belonged to the first four girls' schools with this right, after Wallinska skolan in 1874, Ateneum f√∂r flickor (The Atheneum for Girls), and Lyceum f√∂r flickor (The Lyceum for Girls) in 1882. In 1896, the school included a seminary for female teachers. Around the year 1900, the √Öhlinska skolan was the largest girls' school in Sweden, and during the 1930s, it had around 700 students. Among its noted students were author and women's rights activist Frida St√©enhoff and poet and novelist Karin Boye. In 1939, the school was united with the Wallinska skolan to form the co-educational Wallin-√Öhlinska gymnasiet (Wallin-√Öhlin Gymnasium) as a result of the new educational reform.

She founded and managed the girls' school Klosterskolan in Uppsala from 1855 to 1863 and was the principal of the H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet (Advanced Seminary for Female Teachers) in Stockholm from 1863 to 1868. She organized the rules of the newly founded H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet, was an active participant in the contemporary debate about the educational system in Sweden, and is regarded as a pioneer of the education of girls and women in Sweden. Biography Miller Thengberg was the daughter of a Scotsman named John Miller (d. 1831), who was employed in the British Navy, and Christina Jansson from Sweden. In 1834, she moved to Karlstad in Sweden with her mother. As an adult, she worked as a governess in both Sweden (1845‚Äì1852) and Scotland (1852). In 1854, she married the teacher and librarian Pehr Adrian Thengberg (d. 1859) in Uppsala, where she was introduced in intellectual circles frequented by, among others, PDA Atterbom, Thekla Kn√∂s, Gunnar Wennerberg, and Malla Silfverstolpe. She participated in the contemporary debate about the education of females. At this point, there were criticisms against the girls' schools in Sweden, which were considered shallow. There was also a wish to establish schools which could offer serious academic education to girls, and many girls' schools were established. Between 1855 and 1863, she founded and managed her own girls' school, Klosterskolan, which became known for its high academic standards. From 1857, it also functioned as a female seminary, where she educated adult female teachers. The Klosterskolan was regarded as a pioneer educational institution for females during its short existence. In 1863 Miller Thengberg succeeded Hilda Elfving in the position of principal at the newly established H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet in Stockholm. She organised the institution according to her own pattern in 1864. Her rules became the target of public debate, which is said to have been caused by male teachers whom she had fired, with the support of Fredrika Bremer. Miller Thengberg was described as brusque and efficient. She was not regarded as a feminist but rather held views similar to Sophie Bolander. Although she spoke for females to be given education equal to what was given to males, she did not see it as ideal that they use this education to participate in society. She still supported the conventional idea that a woman's place was in the private life of the home. In 1868, she married a teacher, Carl Norrby, and subsequently resigned her post.

Most notable was the loss of the SS Ying King (Ëã±‰∫¨Ëôü), a passenger steamer, which sank while trying to seek shelter from the storm; 421 lives were lost in that sinking. As a result of this storm, additional safety and shelter measures were undertaken, including the construction of a second typhoon shelter in Hong Kong harbour.  Newspaper reports  At 8:30 pm on the evening of 27 July 1908 (Monday), there was a night signal of Green-Red-Green at the Tamar naval base to indicate a possible typhoon approaching less than 300 miles from the Colony.Straits Times, (4 August 1908, Page 8) and the Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (4 August 1908, Page 5) quoting from the Hong Kong Daily Press 29 July 1908. At 9:30 pm the Hong Kong Observatory reported that the typhoon seemed to be moving in the direction of the Hong Kong coast. Ships anchoring in the harbour took the usual safety precautions, as small native vessels swarmed to the typhoon shelter at Causeway Bay. The weather signals continued to escalate after that. The rain started falling and at 11:15 pm the Observatory was ordered to fire an urgent alarm of three explosive rockets at 10-second intervals, and the night alarm signal on the Tamar changed to Red- Green-Red signalling the risk of hurricane-force winds expected at any moment to strike Hong Kong, equivalent to the hurricane signal number 10 in modern- day Hong Kong SAR. The typhoon reached its peak strength after midnight. The typhoon blew over trees, felled chimneys, cracked walls, and caused substantial damage to property. For four hours, streets were difficult if not impossible to use, owing to many falling and blown objects such as hanging signboards, roof tiles, window glass, and debris of all sorts. Strong winds kept blowing until 6:00 am on the next morning (28 July). In the morning light it became clear that many if not nearly all properties in the Colony would need some repair. Many parallel blinds and shutters had been stripped from windows, glass was broken, roof tiles had been blown away, and walls were stripped of plaster. The July 1908 Typhoon was frequently compared to the typhoon in September 1906. On shore the July 1908 Typhoon caused more damage, though in the harbour the loss of life was less severe, owing to an advance warning from the Hong Kong Observatory and the availability of the typhoon shelter. Last but not least, the July 1908 Typhoon came from the north-east and not from the north-west the September 1906 Typhoon had. The greatest loss was thought to be the sinking of the Ying King steamer which had more than 400 passengers and crew on board. In initial reports, about one thousand people were estimated to have drowned, more than 20 houses collapsed, and most of the Hong Kong wharf facilities were damaged.  Hong Kong Government report  There was a summary report by the Hong Kong Government dated 17 September 1908 presented to Governor Frederick Lugard, and laid before the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Information from this report stated that no less than seven hundred people were drowned in the harbour during the July 1908 typhoon and more than one hundred native vessels were sunk.Report on the typhoon of 27‚Äì28 July 1908 (papers laid before the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on 17 September 1908) A summary of loss: * Government property loss was estimated at HK$100,000. Private loss not yet estimated. * 26 privately owned buildings collapsed, with a loss of 59 lives. * 179 native boat craft had been sunk, wrecked or damaged during the typhoon, with 271 persons missing. * The death toll from the sinking of the Ying King steamer during the typhoon was 421 persons (one European officer and 41 Chinese crew and passengers were saved). * Damage and casualties among the European craft (excluding Ying King) were 17 sank, 23 went ashore, 26 damaged and 5 persons missing. * Damage to the trees, shrubs and plants in Hong Kong was severe, and said to be no less than that caused by the 1906 Typhoon. * The anemometer (used to measure wind speed) on Hong Kong Island was completely wrecked and that at the Observatory much damaged; as a result, it was not possible to have a precise comparison of the wind speed between the September 1906 Typhoon and July 1908 Typhoon. * According to the Hong Kong Government, there was a surplus of relief funds available after the 1906 Typhoon; therefore no need to raise extra funds to aid the sufferers in the 1908 typhoon situation.  Maritime damage and loss  = Loss of the SS Ying King = Tai Mo To, one of The Brothers islands (Â§ßÂ∞èÁ£®ÂàÄÊ¥≤) The SS Ying King (Ëã±‰∫¨Ëôü) was a Hong Kong-based passenger steamer of 768 tons, built in 1903.

The Ying King was one of three steamers coming from Canton, and as the wind was gaining force, was making her way to anchor and shelter in the lee of The Brothers (Â§ßÂ∞èÁ£®ÂàÄÊ¥≤) with the intent to weather the storm north of Lantau Island. Eventually the Ying King foundered and only 42 people survived.The Register of Adelaide, South Australia (31 August 1908, page 6), quoting from the China Mail of 18 August 1908 regarding the details of an enquiry into the tragic loss of HK-Canton steamer Ying King. The SS Fatshan was said to be second to arrive at The Brothers, and the third steamer, SS Kwong Sai soon followed. Capt. Crowe from the Kwong Sai reported that shortly after his steamer dropped anchor, there was a sudden and fierce strong wind squall, and the Ying King was said to be gone and disappeared after that. Subsequently, there was a rescue effort from Hong Kong on 28 July at about 9:30 pm regarding a party of 42 survivors from the Ying King. They were rescued at Pillar Point and the Castle Peak by the customs cruising launch Kowloon Sai. Captain Hewett from the Kowloon Sai said that he heard a gun fired, and saw people waving. He had the launch go towards the shore, and found the people to be the survivors from the Ying King. The survivors consisted of Mr Ferguson (the chief mate), an Indian watchman, two quartermasters, a tallyman, three firemen, one sailor, and 33 Chinese passengers. Mr Ferguson reported that Ying King was a total wreck, and nothing was known about the fate of the other ship officers, including Capt. Page, Mr Fotheringham and Mr Newman. The report from the survivors was that the Ying King had sunk in the early morning of 28 July. The report was that the Ying King developed a leak, and while the pumps were working they failed to pump out enough water. The steamer continued to list more and at about 2:50 am she foundered. Witness reported that they could not provide enough lifebelts to the passengers, as more lifebelts were stowed on the lowest decks of the steamer. Just before Ying King went down, Captain Page gave the word, every man for himself. From what was gathered from the survivors, there was chaos and confusion. Two lifeboats were lowered, but no one was able to get in them. As the Ying King was sinking, Mr Fergusson, the chief mate, remained on board until she had almost sunk. Then he joined eight crew members and 33 passengers to get ashore close to Castle Peak Farm. The survivors were floating with the aid of wreckage and lifebuoys, and they reported that all the others were likely lost. When last seen Captain Page had a lifebelt on, and was entering the water. Eventually, the police recovered the dead body of a European off Castle Peak on 31 July, which was washed up presumably from the wreck of the Ying King, but no one was able to recognise him. The following morning four fishermen were charged before the local magistracy for stealing a gold watch and chain from the dead body of a European. Detective Sgt. Terrett, who was in Court recognised the stolen items as belonging to Capt. Page, who had purchased them at Messrs. Ullman's, in Queen's Road Central. A cigar cutter attached to the chain, was another source of his identification. The Court found that the Ying King was lost through the typhoon, and that all reasonable precautions had been taken. Captain Page, an Australian, and together with three European passengers were all drowned. Captain Page's wife had sailed for Sydney with their little child three months earlier. = The SS Eastern and other steamers = Capt. McArthur, of the SS Eastern, after his 1908 Hong Kong typhoon saga, stated that every one had experienced the very strong force of the wind. At the height of the typhoon, the Eastern was resting at anchor, and the crew had to crawl on their hands and knees to the bow of the vessel, apparently no one could stand up against the powerful wind. There was a second buoy beside her. The steamer Chihli was also seen having difficulties. The Eastern was lucky to go through the challenging ordeal without much damage, even though at one point of time, it risked being hit by another drifting vessel. The Juteopolis sailing vessel had two of her masts blown overboard and the top gallant mast was hanging over the stern. On the southern part of Stonecutters Island, the Pocahontas and Lai-Sang were ashore, and on the eastern side of the Island the Schuylkill had grounded. Quite a few vessels were also blown ashore, including the seagoing steamer Aeolus. Also a river steamer Sunon sank at the wharf. The steamer Asia was listing, and the Persia was ashore near Hung Hom Bay, lying on a mud shoal. The Tai Wan steamer was damaged by a collision with the Aeolus. Also the steamer Neil McLeod was reported to have crashed into the Tai Wan steamer and her sixteen crew members went on board the Tai Wan before the Neil McLeod drifted away, and eventually went ashore at Capsuimun. The Katherine Park, a British steamer, broke away from Kowloon Bay and drifted off North Point, and her anchors got entangled with the telegraph cables which held her until the storm had ceased. At Kowloon Docks eleven launches and three junks had foundered, and a few lighters belonging to the Cement Works had also gone to the bottom. The torpedo boat destroyer Whiting was ashore at Lyemun, but was able to be refloated after the storm. The low wall at Arsenal Street was nearly washed away, and 14 cargo boats and sampans that did not get to the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter, were smashed on the Praya promenade wall. A number of police and civilians were present at the time, and through their joint efforts, were able to save fifty people from this cargo fleet. At the Tung Tai Tseung Kee shipyard (a local firm of engineers and shipbuilders), a small steamer under construction was smashed against the Praya wall and badly damaged. It was first lifted bodily onto the Praya promenade, but later carried back into the water again by the terrific waves. The Naval Yard was fully loaded and filled with police and marine launches. There was an accident when Police Sergeant Boole entered the Naval Yard with his No. 1 police launch. The shelter space was not sufficient, in consequence of which much damage was done upon his entry. A sudden lurch to port sent the police sergeant and his crew overboard, and they had to swim for their lives and luckily they all made it to land safely. There were 70 native craft wrecked when they could not get to the shelter in time. Seven steam launches sank, and seven were blown onto shore. Ten cargo lighters sank, several went aground, and seven were damaged before the typhoon went on to Canton, where massive destruction was also caused.  Heroes of the storm, the \\"Gallant Bluejackets\\"  Among the many heroic actions reported, a crew member of noticed a nearby junk in peril at about 11:40 pm, and after a quick consultation a cutter was promptly lowered with twelve rowers and a steersman, under Torpedo Officer McLaughlin. When the battleship kept its searchlight going in the dark and with an effort of about twenty minutes they succeeded in reaching the junk in distress. Their further efforts to rescue the six Chinese boatmen there were done with success. But the remaining task to come back to shore was a difficult one, and a continuous effort of 45 minutes was required to take them back to the pier. Upon their approach to Douglas Pier a rope was thrown to them, and the rescued boatmen and the crew were hauled safely ashore ‚Äì however a small Chinese boy who lay unconscious at the bottom of the cutter had been left behind. When the young lad was discovered to be missing a bluejacket determined to return to the cutter and rescue him. Right after both were safely on shore, the cutter crashed into the pier and sank. All the rescued and rescuers were then brought to St George's Club after 1:15 am where everything possible was provided for their comfort.  Property damage  The property damage in the City was not generally not large in individual cases, yet the aggregate would be very extensive and the total loss was viewed as very considerable. In the week of 18‚Äì25 July, Hong Kong posted a record of 16.2 inches rainfall. The continued wet weather in July 1908 being combined with the fury of a storm, was possibly responsible for some building collapses in the Colony. The greatest damage to property was done at Kingsclere private hotel, where a portion of the beautiful building was in ruins. A tall chimney fell with an alarming noise at Kingsclere, in Kennedy Road, carrying with it all the roof over three rooms on the top floor and part of the walls. The resident of the room, Mr Hunt, of Messrs. Shewan, Tomes, and Company, who was in the Colony for about three months, apparently rose from the bed to look out, but hearing the big noise overhead. He reckoned that something was wrong and immediately sought refuge under the bed. Then the crash came. The debris fell on the bed and filled the room, but luckily enough, the bed legs stood the strain and gave Mr Hunt a chance to breathe. But the weight on his body and legs was great, and he suffered in pain. A rescue team was early on the scene under the command of Police Chief Inspector Baker, and it took the fire brigade no less than four hours to rescue Mr Hunt. They worked with no little danger by reason of the unsupported wall which risked falling at any time. They rescued the unfortunate young man and sent him to the Government Civil Hospital to treat his internal injuries. Another serious collapse was at the offices of the King's Buildings after a chimney broke in the roof and forced its way through four floors. The place was completely wrecked, but fortunately there was no loss of life. The upper floor, occupied by Messrs. Jebsen and Company, collapsed, and the whole floor fell through into Meyer and Company's office, the accumulation descending into the lower floor office of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Queen's College also had its roof of the assembly hall partly carried away, with their center wooden beams being thrown away like matches. The roof of their north-west classrooms were severely damaged. In addition to the accident which happened to Mr Hunt at Kingsclere, there were numerous instances of injuries to people during the storm. One of the firemen proceeding to Kingsclere rescue had a narrow escape, nearly hit by a branch of a tree falling on his head, only with his helmet saving him from serious head injury. Police Sgt. Clark was injured by a falling door and Police Sgt. Devney hurt his hand and foot by falling. Mr F. Wills, chief engineer of the SS Barra fell off a wharf at Kennedytown and received back injuries, and being treated in the Government Civil Hospital.  Weather reports from ships received by wireless telegraphy  Timeballs near Tsim Sha Tsui Marine Police Headquarters Compound, 1908 The new time-ball tower on Signal Hill (also known as Blackhead Point) had been set up in 1908 at Tsim Sha Tsui to replace the previous time- ball tower at the Marine Police Station at Tsim Sha Tsui. In 1908, there was an introduction and wider use of wireless signals on radio broadcasting for Hong Kong vessel weather reports.  Tax imposed on Hong Kong shipping for a second typhoon shelter  Hong Kong sources stated that the government proposed in the Legislative Council meeting on 6 August 1908 to impose on all river steamers a tax of five-sixths of a cent, per ton register, and two cents per registered tonnage on all other ships (excluding British and other warships) entering the Hong Kong waters to contribute to a construction fund for this second typhoon shelter.Hong Kong Legislative Council Report (6 August 1908) Upon the recommendation of the Typhoon Refuge Committee (including the six shipping representatives from the P&O; Company; Jardine, Matheson & Co.; Butterfield and Swire, Gibb, Livingston & Co.; David Sassoon & Co.; and Shewan, Tomes & Co.) who recorded their opinion that this new typhoon refuge was necessary and that it should be constructed at Mongkoktsui (Yau Ma Tei), in case the craft from the west could not get to Causeway Bay shelter in time of a strong gale. According to the report, the number of vessels counted outside the Causeway Bay shelter on the morning of 28 July, included 98 junks, 38 European lighters in Kowloon Bay, Hung Hom Bay, off Yaumati and behind Stonecutters, and 200 sampans were also counted off Yaumati. There were also 112 native craft and four European lighters in Chinwan Bay. The report concluded that had there been a second typhoon shelter at Mongkoktsui, all these 452 vessels as well as a large number of sampans could have found safe refuge there. Apparently, some shipping firms staged strong protest against this proposed tax. The aggregate tonnage of British shipping in Hong Kong in 1907 was about 6 million tons, and those of foreign ships were about 5.5 million tons. The proposed construction cost of the second typhoon shelter was HK$1.5 million. However, the Hong Kong Legislative Council eventually approved the construction of the second typhoon shelter in Mongkoktsui in 1909.  References   External links  * The Hong Kong Typhoon.

She was the founder and director of the √Öhlinska skolan in Stockholm, and its principal in 1847- 1900. Biography Karin √Öhlin was born and raised in Stockholm as the eldest daughter of Major Paul Pehr √Öhlin and Wilhelmina Gustafva Norberg. After the death of her mother in 1847, she was left with the responsibility to raise and educate her younger siblings at the age of seventeen. At this point, the normal profession for a female of the middle class in need to support herself was that on a teacher, and she started to give lessons in her home to not only her siblings but also to paying pupils. She was an appreciated educator and was able to accept more and more pupils, some of them as guests in her home, an enterprise which gradually developed into the larger and larger expanding √Öhlinska skolan. During the expanding of the school, she initially employed her sisters as teachers as they reached adulthood, and eventually also educated teachers she could provide a proper salary. Karin √Öhlin was principal of the school until 1900 and subsequently succeeded by Lydia Wahlstr√∂m, who remained until 1934. Karin √Öhlin remained the school's director until her death at the age of 68 in 1899. The work of Karin √Öhlin was a significant contribution to the educational system for girls, which experienced a rapid expansion in the mid 19th-century from girl's schools which only offered a shallow education in accomplishments, to the net of private secondary education schools for girls which covered Sweden in the 1870s, a development in which she played an important part. In 1890, Karin √Öhlin was presented with the royal medal Illis quorum meruere labores in gold for her achievements in the education of women in Sweden.

After returning home, he went on the road as a vaudeville performer. His first solo ukulele recording, \\"You know Me Alabam'\\", was in 1924 on the Radiex label under the name Johnny Marvin. Johnny Marvin, Ukulele Hall of Fame He was an early adapter of the Martin Tiple style ukulele.

In a racing career which lasted from July 1997 until October 1999 she won six of her ten races. In addition to her wins in the Champion Stakes she also won the C. L. Weld Park Stakes in 1997 and the Pretty Polly Stakes and the Nassau Stakes in 1998. Following her retirement from racing she had some success as a dam of winners. Background Alborada was a grey mare bred by her owner Kirsten Rausing at the Lanwades Stud at Moulton near Newmarket. She was sired by Alzao, a son of Lyphard who never won above Group Three level, but became a successful breeding stallion, with his progeny including Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes), Winona, Second Set and Shahtoush. Alborada's dam Alouette, from whom she inherited her grey colour, won three races including the Listed Oyster Stakes at Galway Racecourse in 1993 and was a half-sister of the Doncaster Cup- winning filly Alleluia and Last Second, the winner of the Nassau Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes. After her retirement from racing, Alouette became a successful broodmare: in addition to Alborada, she produced Albanova, a German-trained filly who won the Grosser Preis von Berlin Rheinland-Pokal, Preis von Europa in 2004. The filly fractured a pedal bone as a foal and could not be sent to the sales. Rausing therefore decided to race Alborada in her own colours and sent her into training with Sir Mark Prescott at the Heath House stable in Newmarket. She was ridden in all but one of her races by the veteran British jockey George Duffield. Racing career =1997: two-year- old season= Alborada made her racecourse debut on 19 July in a six furlong maiden race at Nottingham Racecourse. She started 2/1 favourite but after meeting interference in the closing stages she finished third of the seventeen runners behind Dazilyn Lady. Twelve days later at Goodwood Racecourse she contested a similar event and finished third to Midnight Line, a filly who went on to finish third in The Oaks and win the Long Island Handicap. On 17 September Alborada ran in a maiden race over seven and a half furlongs at Beverley Racecourse. She started the 2/5 favourite and led from the start to win by six lengths to record her first victory. In October, the filly was moved up in class when she was sent to Ireland to contest the Group Three Park Stakes at the Curragh. On this occasion she was ridden by Seb Sanders and started 3/1 favourite against nine opponents. Alborada took the lead inside the final quarter mile and went clear in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Winona, with the future Oaks winner Shahtoush in fourth. =1998: three-year-old season= Alborada did not race in the spring of 1998, missing races such as the 1000 Guineas and the Epsom Oaks as the Heath House stable was affected by an outbreak of equine influenza. The filly also missed an intended engagement in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and did not reappear until 27 June when she was sent to the Curragh again for the Irish Pretty Polly Stakes (then a Group Two race). Racing over ten furlongs on soft ground, she started the 7/4 favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths. On 1 August at Goodwood she raced in Britain for the first time in ten and a half months when she ran in the Group Two Nassau Stakes. Starting at odds of 4/1 she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from the 25/1 outsider Digitalize, with Midnight Line in third. On 12 September, Alborada ran in her first Group One race when she was matched against colts and older horses in the Esat Digifone Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. Her rivals included the dual King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Swain, the International Stakes winner One So Wonderful, the Oaks winner Shahtoush, the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Tarascon and the 1997 European Champion two-year-old Xaar. Duffield settled the filly in third place before moving into second in the straight. She could make no further progress and finished second of the eight runners behind Swain. On her final appearance of the season, Alborada contested the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket on 17 October and started at odds of 6/1, with Daylami being made the odds-on favourite. After tracking the leaders for most of the way, Alborada took the lead approaching the final furlong and held the late challenge of Insatiable to win by a neck, with Daylami in third. The unplaced horses included One So Wonderful and the future Arlington Million winner Chester House. The win was enthusiastically received by the Newmarket crowd, reflecting the popularity of her jockey and trainer. Commenting on the stresses involved in training a top-class racehorse, Prescott commented: \\"You spend a lifetime watching races like this and wishing you could have a runner that good; and when you do it kills you.\\" =1999: four-year-old season= Alborada raced only twice as a four-year-old in 1999 as her season was disrupted by injury. On 31 July she started the 15/8 favourite for the Nassau Stakes, (run for the first time as a Group One race) but finished fifth behind the three-year-old Zahrat Dubai. Prescott could offer no explanation for the filly's poor performance. On 16 October, Alborada attempted to become the second female racecourse (after Triptych) to win consecutive runnings of the Champion Stakes. The Japanese-bred filly Shiva, winner of the Tattersalls Gold Cup, started favourite ahead of Lear Spear who had defeated Fantastic Light in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Alborada shared third place in the betting with the 1998 Epsom Derby winner High-Rise. The fifty-two-year- old Duffield tracked the leaders before sending Alborada into the lead approaching the final furlong and she won the race by one and a quarter lengths from Shiva, with Kabool in third. After the race Prescott admitted that he had considered retiring the filly in September after her injury problems and poor performances in training. Duffield said \\"she's an absolute superstar and this is a bonus for me at my age.\\" Kirsten Rausing called Alborada \\"a filly for the history books; a great filly who will always be remembered in Newmarket.\\" Stud record Alborada was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the Lanwades Stud. She has produced at least three winners: * Alvarita (foaled in 2002, grey filly, sired by Selkirk), won two races including the Listed Prix Petite Etoile. * Albaraka (2008, grey filly, by Selkirk), won one race, placed in the Listed Glasgow Stakes. * Albion (2009, bay colt, by With Approval), won two races, second in the Prix Greffulhe. She produced her last foal, a colt sired by Archipenko in February 2012, but died shortly after delivering the foal.

They are manned and operated by 1 Assault Group Royal Marines.Royal Marines - Landing Craft, royalnavy.mod.uk, Retrieved 15 June 2014 United States The American version of the LCVP, or Higgins boat was used extensively in amphibious landings in World War II. The craft was designed by Andrew Higgins based on boats made for operating in swamps and marshes. More than 20,000 were built, by Higgins Industries and licensees.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, Random House, New York, NY. . pp. 204-206 Typically constructed from plywood, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat could ferry a platoon-sized complement of 36 men to shore at 9 knots (17 km/h). Men generally entered the boat by climbing down a cargo net hung from the side of their troop transport; they exited by charging down the boat's bow ramp. Australia Since 1993, the Royal Australian Navy has operated four Australian-designed and built Landing Craft, Vehicle and Personnel (similar in size and concept to the World War II LCVP) from the landing ship, heavy and replenishment oiler . These aluminum craft were built by Geraldton Boat Builders and can carry up to 36 personnel or a Land Rover with a half-ton trailer. They are maintained for the RAN by the firm DMS Maritime. As of 2007, T 4 was held in reserve at the naval base , T 5 and T 6 were carried by Tobruk, and T 7 was embarked on Success. The craft remained in service as of 2015. Others Other countries with naval resources may also have LCVPs. For example, the Italian ship San Giusto is recorded as having a complement of these. The Royal Canadian Navy's supply ship MS Asterix will utilize 2 LCVP.

Wayman is best known for creating the International Consumer Electronics Show in 1967. CES is now the United States' largest annual event and the world's largest consumer technology trade show.  Biography  Jack Wayman was born in Miami in the 1920s, the only child of a successful home builder, particularly in South Beach, and the family grew up on an island between Miami and Miami Beach. After graduating from Davidson College in 1943, Wayman was drafted into the Army, and served as an infantry captain during the Normandy Invasion.  Early career  Wayman returned to Miami after leaving the military and became personal assistant to Arthur Vining Davis, who at the time was Chairman of Alcoa, Chairman of Alcoa Fruit Company, and founder of Arvida Properties. After two years Davis encouraged him to enroll in Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. During his time at Georgetown, Wayman worked days in a local electronics store called Lacy's and took classes at night. In 1952 Wayman was recruited by RCA to be distributor salesman for Southern Wholesalers, a six-state RCA distributor in Washington, DC. This role eventually expanded to a position as RCA's advertising manager and trade show manager, where he produced semi-annual shows for the company's 100 retail accounts. After ten years with RCA, he became Staff Director for the twelve-member Home Electronics Section of the Electronics Industry Association. Within a year, the Home Electronics Section had been renamed Consumer Products Division and Wayman had grown the trade group's membership to 25.  Consumer Electronics Show  By the mid 1960s, transistors were coming in from Japanese manufacturers and color TVs had finally sold the first million sets. Wayman saw the need for an industry trade show, much like the show radio manufacturers had in the 1920s and 1930s, where the middlemen and distributors could come and see the new products. Wayman presented the idea to his Board, but they initially rejected the idea out of fear that Japanese manufacturers would steal their executives and designs. But Wayman was persistent and after three board meetings, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was finally approved although RCA/Zenith, one of the largest member companies, agreed to support the show for only one year. Wayman spent the next several months planning CES, only to see his venue of choice, McCormick Place in Chicago, burn down before his eyes in January 1967. He immediately booked the Americana and Hilton hotels in New York City. Wayman had convinced Jules Steinberg to hold the annual National Appliance and Radio Dealers Association (NARDA) show with CES for four years, thereby guaranteeing an initial attendance base. The initial show in June 1967 had 200 exhibitors, 17,500 attendees (mostly NARDA members), and 100,000 square feet of exhibit space. Today CES is at 1.9 million square feet, 150,000 attendees, and 2,700 exhibitors.  Sony Betamax case  Sony released the Betamax at the 1975 Consumer Electronics Show. Shortly thereafter Universal City Studios sued Sony, and Wayman, as Senior Vice President of the Electronic Industry Association's Consumer Electronics Group, spent the next five years representing the VCR and tape manufacturers against Jack Valenti, then head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and his claims that home taping and video rentals were detrimental to the future of profitability in making movies.

CVET interview video Early life With an English-born father and a Coloured mother, Daniels was automatically racially classified as Coloured, a term he took exception to. He preferred to be called South African. His childhood was largely happy in the neighbourhoods of District Six and Lavender Hill, Cape Town. Encounters with gangs and police injustice helped to form his ideas of fairness and decent behaviour. Living close to Table Mountain, Daniels and his friends had plenty of opportunity to spend time walking and climbing. Education and work Daniels attended local schools, and finished his schooling with a standard six certificate (grade eight). He had various small jobs while still a schoolboy, and eventually, shortly after the end of World War II, Daniels attempted to join the Merchant fleet, but had to defer that ambition till later, in 1954, he was able to go whaling. After his days at sea, Daniels joined the diamond-mining business in Oranjemund, where he operated large machines to clear the bedrock of sand. Since nobody enquired, Daniels was accepted as white. The beauty of the wild and solitude both at sea and in the desert all appealed to him. His recollections of events such as hunting whales could make vivid and lasting impressions on his audience. The killing of a 94 ft whale in Antarctica was one such event. He was able to convey both horror and wonder in such recollections. Activism Daniels was particularly perceptive, and was soon sensitised to the inequalities around him. In 1952 he started being more active, attending meetings and protest marches. This was also the start of Daniels' involvement with his political home, the Liberal Party. Politics On returning from Oranjemund to Cape Town, Daniels became aware of more injustices through his involvement in a photographic business. He started seeing the hurt that people suffered simply because they were non-white. After becoming involved in various demonstrations, he found that the Liberal Party of South Africa which later became the African Resistance Movement in 1961 espoused the principles (democracy and justice in a non-racial South Africa) that he valued. \\"It was a happy day that I joined the Liberal Party of South Africa (LP), because there I met some of the nicest and bravest people dedicated to the principles of non-racialism and justice.\\" When Daniels told Walter Sisulu how he joined the LP, Sisulu was amazed that Daniels just walked up and joined an organisation on the basis of its principles. Through the militancy of the LP and the organisations it associated with, Daniels was involved in acts of sabotage which ultimately led to his becoming a political prisoner. Imprisonment From 1964 to 1979, Daniels was in custody - for most of that time on Robben Island. He describes his experiences with court officials, police, prison warders and fellow-prisoners with great honesty and humour in his autobiography. Although he was not a member of the African National Congress, he was close to Nelson Mandela, and was often singled out for sharing of information.\\"Eddie Daniels\\", South African History Online. After his release from prison, Daniels was kept under house arrest until July 1983. During his time in jail, Daniels managed to further his education, obtaining BA and BComm degrees. After his banning order was lifted, he obtained a teaching diploma and started on a teaching career - at the time of student unrest and protests. Personal life At the time of having to be confined to the Cape Town Magisterial District, Daniels renewed his friendship with Eleanor Buchanan (now a widow) whom he knew from his Oranjemund days. They were unable to marry as Eleanor was white, and simply having a serious relationship risked breaking the law. In 1983, Daniels and Eleanor married in contravention of the Group Areas Act. Seven years later, after the repeal of the Act, they were married again, legally, and were to spend many happy years together until Eleanor's death in 2001. Daniels often traveled overseas to speak at events, usually of an educational nature, where he frequently thanked people for support during the difficult years.\\"Author, anti-apartheid activist Eddie Daniels to speak Oct. 24\\", College of Arts and Letters, University of Notre Dame, 16 October 2006http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/monitor/10-23-06/page24107.html In 2014, Daniels was asked to officiate at the annual Freedom Swim, as part of celebrations of 20 years of democracy in South Africa. The Freedom Swim, from Robben Island to Big Bay, had been struggling at the time, due to the difficult conditions and complicated nature of the event. Daniels' participation helped breathe new life into the event, and his speech at the prize-giving inspired a new generation of swimmers, many of whom from circumstances akin to his own.

The architect Sir Christopher Wren, who lived there from 1708 to 1723, was given a 50-year lease on the property by Queen Anne in lieu of overdue payments for his work on St Paul's Cathedral. The lease passed from Wren's son to his grandson. It was purchased from the Crown Estate in 1984. King Henry VIII obtained the newly built Hampton Court Palace from Cardinal Wolsey in 1526. From that time onwards, all the property around Hampton Court also became the property of the monarch and this included The Old Court House. It is the only house on Hampton Court Green, other than Hampton Court itself, to have a garden that stretches to the River Thames. Wren's dining room is now used as a study. This beautifully proportioned room features wood panelling chosen by Wren and a fine marble fireplace similar to the one he installed for King William III in the King's dining room in Hampton Court Palace. Beyond the reception hall, a flight of stone steps take you into the garden which leads right down to the Thames. In Wren's day his most important visitors ‚Äì normally royalty ‚Äì would arrive by river, walk across the garden and up those steps to enter his house via the back door. This meant the garden had to be just as magnificent as the house. The building is accordingly surrounded by several different types of tree and copious bushes bursting with figs, walnuts, apples, crab apples, cherries, raspberries, mint and borage. The greenery extends all the way to the river bank while York stone terraces lead to a pea shingle path which is flanked by lawn. This path then leads to a pond and fountain that was built by Wren and which was listed before The Old Court House itself. Wren's tool house is now a charming garden room from which to enjoy the garden in the summer. History King Henry VIII took the newly built Hampton Court Palace from Cardinal Wolsey in 1526. All the property around Hampton Court then belonged to the monarch. In 1669, Wren (1632‚Äì1723) was appointed as the Royal Surveyor by King Charles II. Previously, Inigo Jones and Sir John Denham held this post. The King had been impressed by Wren's plans to reconstruct the City of London after the Great Fire of 1666. The Royal Surveyor, or Surveyor General, was like a modern Minister of Works. He ordered the King's works at all of the palaces; Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James Palace and Windsor Castle. Wren held this post for 49 years until 1718, straddling 5 reigns: Charles II, James II, William III and Mary II, and Anne and George I, while at the same time building many city churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. At each Royal palace, the Surveyor General had lodgings. These at Hampton Court became the Old Court House Built in 1536. Wren's biggest task at Hampton Court was the construction of the Eastern part of Hampton Court Palace (the square part) including the main East and South fronts, and Fountain Court. William and Mary had wanted to rebuild Hampton Court Palace entirely, but with the early death of Mary in 1694, King William lost heart. The project was only half done. Hampton Court was left as it remains today, half Tudor and half Wren. Wren, already aged 76, was granted in 1708, a 50-year lease of The Old Court House by Queen Anne. This was partly in lieu of arrears of salary for building St Pauls Cathedral. He had been paid on a time basis. The authorities thought that, to be paid more, he had dragged his feet.Parentalia p. 343 ‚ÄúIn an act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of King William for the completing and adorning of the cathedral church of St Paul, London, a clause was inserted to suspend a moiety (i.e. half) of the surveyor‚Äôs salary until the said church should be finished; thereby the better to encourage to him to finish the same with the utmost diligence and expedition. ‚ÄúIt was at this time a common notion and misreport that the surveyor received a large annual salary for that building and consequently it was in his interest to prolong the finishing of the fabrick for the continuance of this supposed emolument. Which it would seem occasioned that clause... ‚ÄúUpon the compleating of this great fabric (St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral in 1708) a clause passed in the act of parliament in the ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne declaring the church finished, to empower the commissioners to pay the surveyor the arrears of this moiety of his salary.‚Äù NB: The bottom of page 344 says: ‚ÄúHe then betook himself to country retirement.‚Äù The word \\"retirement\\" here has its ancient meaning. It means withdraw or drawing back (not ceasing to be employed or moving house). Wren had already lived in the Old Court House since 1669, and since 1708 as long leaseholder. The Treasury minutes, page 26 1708 say: ‚ÄúHer Majesty (Queen Anne) observes that when Sir Christopher dies his house will go to his executors and consequently the surveyor of the works who will have no house at the Hampton Court. Nevertheless in regard Sir Christopher has been an old servant to the Crown, the Queen will gratify him in his request.‚Äù Stephen Wren in 1749 sold the rest of his grandfather's 50-year Crown lease. =Wren and subsequent owners and occupiers= In 1669 Wren was appointed as the Royal Surveyor by King Charles II. He ordered the King's works at all of the palaces; Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James Palace and Windsor Castle. Wren held this post for 49 years until 1718, straddling five reigns; Charles II, James II, William III and Mary II, Anne and George I whilst at the same time building many city churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. At each palace the Royal Surveyor had lodgings. At Hampton Court these were The Old Court House. Towards the end of World War I until 1921, The Old Court House was the temporary site of the Hampton Court Auxiliary Hospital which had been started by the British Red Cross and the Order of St. John to nurse wounded soldiers. Baker, Rowland G M (1981) The Story of Molesey Hospital. Subsequent lessees included Admiral Sir Alexander Montgomery, the Dowager Lady Clinton and General Sir Henry Wheatley. Norman Lamplugh, a distinguished collector, lived at the house from 1908 to 1938 (see 1 October 1938 issue of Country Life). He was followed by the 2nd Earl of Ypres who was a watercolour painter. He was the son of 1st World War Field Marshal Sir John French who became the 1st Earl of Ypres. In 1958, the form of tenure changed. In part exchange for an increase in the Queen's civil list, many Crown freeholds were passed from the property section of Buckingham Palace to Crown Estates. A 99-year Crown Estate lease began with Ronald Lee (at The Old Court House 1958‚Äì64). He was a well-known dealer in antiques, especially in clocks, in Bruton Street, London W1. His lease included permission to trade in antiques from The Old Court House. He hived off and sold the lease of the neighbouring Paper House which had been joined to the Old Court House since 1810. (Prior to 1810, The Old Court House had been called Paper House.) In 1964, Ronald Lee sold the house to Stewart De Quincey Walker ‚Äì the partner-in-crime of the notorious Dr Emil Savundra. Both were jailed for fraud in 1968. Earlier in 1966, the house was sold, reputedly for a suitcase full of banknotes, to Julian Reynolds. He sold the remaining 89-year lease in 1968 to Toby Jessel, then one of the two Greater London Council members for the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, in which Hampton Court Palace and The Old Court House are both situated. Toby Jessel was elected MP for Twickenham in 1970 and served for 27 years until 1997. In 1980, he married the actress and singer Eira Heath and he owned The Old Court House for over 45 years. In 1984 The Crown Estates department sold the freeholds to many leaseholders of houses around Hampton Court, Greenwich, St James and Windsor including The Old Court House, the freehold to which was acquired by Jessel. During his ownership of The Old Court House, Jessel entertained many people from the political establishment at The Old Court House, including Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The Old Court House ‚Äì the building =Tudor period= The original Tudor building of Old Court House was built for the Surveyor-general in 1536 Heath. The Knight Frank and Rutley brochure of 1966 p4 mentions a carved stone surround of Tudor design behind the existing Charles II fireplace in the study (formerly the dining room), but this has not been exposed. Some of the brick wall in the garden is probably Tudor, being \\"English bond\\" (pre-1689 when William of Orange who became William III introduced \\"Flemish Bond\\"). The cobbled part of Faraday yard behind has similar cobbles to Tudor cobbles both in the palace and in the Royal mews in Hampton Court road. There is a (possibly) Tudor beam in the cellar, previously the kitchen. =Early changes to The Old Court House= 1660‚Äì68 ‚Äì Gerald Heath's paper pages (G) 1, 2, 3 shows works to the surveyors \\"lodgings\\" when the Royal Surveyor was Sir John Denham. 1669 ‚Äì Wren became the Surveyor General; from 1670 repairs were made to the surveyors \\"house\\" (pages 3,4,5) 1706 ‚Äì Wren referred to the \\"great decay\\" of the house, 1708 prior to Wren's 50-year lease; Savil Travers(?) reported it as \\"old and decayed and will be expensive to repair\\". 1708 ‚Äì Wren's lease of 50 years started. Heath, pp. 3, 4. 1709‚Äì10 ‚Äì Wren undertook extensive renovations of The Old Court House in 1706. Wren altered the house a great deal- he built a virtually new house. In 1708 Queen Anne granted him a 50-year lease on the property in lieu of overdue payments for his work on St Paul's Cathedral. 1723 ‚Äì Death of Wren. 1730s or 1740s ‚Äì The back (south) half of the house was added in the time of Christopher Wren junior. This includes the drawing room on the first floor, and 3 of the 5 bedrooms on the second floor, and the new dining room (previously the library) the back hall, and the kitchen on the ground floor. In 1749 his grandson Stephen Wren sold the remainder of the lease. =Later changes to The Old Court House= 1810‚Äì? ‚Äì The master gardener's house (now called Paper House) was joined to the Old Court House to make one house. They were finally separated in 1960 after Ronald Lee had, in 1958, bought a 99-year Crown lease of the whole property. The effects of the 1810 to 1960 join include a joint roof over the front; and the Old Court House cellar (the original kitchen) goes a little under Paper House. Neither has led to any problems between the two households. 1823 or later ‚Äì The Greek motifs were put into the drawing room and what is now the master bedroom on the 1st floor probably by General Sir Henry Wheatley (era of Byron, and schools then taught Greek). After 1858 the two drawing rooms were made into one. Lady Clinton put bow windows onto the front of the house.

Release  The film was given a limited European release in 2007 and had its US premiere in Boston in 2009. Despite being a British film with some notable names in the cast, it was not released in the UK until March 2013.  Critical response  The film received the Audience Award at the 2007 Zurich Film Festival, Indie Spirit Best Storyline Award at the 2009 Boston International Film Festival and the Best Film Award at the 2009 LA British Film Festival. The LA Campus Circle graded the film A- and called it \\"smart, funny and surprising without being pretentious or hackneyed. There are few dull moments, and it actually succeeds in pulling off the twists.\\" The film was also praised by The Film Review and CineVue. The Guardian, however, gave it a poor review, as did the Radio Times and the Daily Express.

It has a bottle-shaped swollen trunk in which water is stored for the dry season and is known locally as palo borracho. Description Flowers of Ceiba chodatii Ceiba chodatii is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a tall, stout, bare trunk. It grows to about tall, has a number of thick branches at the top of the swollen trunk and has a rounded crown. The bark is smooth with vertical ridges and horizontal wrinkles. It contains chlorophyll and is green when young and able to photosynthesize, but turns grey with age. It is covered with thick, woody conical spines. The alternate leaves are palmate with five lobes and serrated edges. The flowers are large, solitary and creamy white with a few purple flecks. They are up to long with yellow-green calyces and funnel-shaped corollas with five fleshy, hairy petals joined at the base. The fruit is a large, oblong green capsule. When ripe it splits open to reveal black seeds surrounded by a mass of white fibres resembling cotton. Distribution and habitat Ceiba chodatii is native to the forests of Bolivia, the Chaco region of Paraguay and the Piedmont Mountains of western Argentina where it is found in seasonally dry woodlands. It flowers between February and May. Ecology The flowers open at dusk and are probably pollinated by sphingid moths. Other members of the genus are pollinated by bats but this seems unlikely for Ceiba chodatii as the flowers produce little nectar. Humming birds also visit the flowers but do not touch the anthers or stigma. Self-pollination does not occur in this species because of a late-acting form of self-incompatibility. The bottle-shaped trunk is swollen with water being retained by the tree for use in the dry season. The indigenous people of the Chaco make use of this water for their cattle and the timber is used to make canoes and articles for daily use. Fibres from the trunk are woven into ropes and extracts from the bark are used for tanning and as a dye. The dry chaco where this tree is found has dense spiny woodlands consisting of low trees and an understorey of Aspidosperma, Astronium, Schinopsis, Ceiba, and Bulnesia. The ground is clad in thorny plants, some with microphylls and others with no leaves and cacti such as Cereus and Stetsonia. Some plants such as Jacaratia accumulate water in tubercles.

Located close to the Verne Citadel and East Cliff, the station was established in the 1950s as part of a nationwide air defence radar system built by the British Government during the Cold War. The station became a scheduled monument in 2004 and is now the site of the community farm, Fancy's Family Farm. History During World War II, the site was the location of a Chain Home Extra Low (CHEL) radar station. The same site was chosen for the building of Portland's Centimetric Early Warning (CEW) Radar Station in 1950-51 by contractor Robert McAlpine. It was built as part of the ROTOR programme for the detection of Soviet fast-flying jets. Portland's example was one of eight CEW stations built across the country. It was equipped with various 'Stage One' radar systems. Portland's station was reduced to CHEL readiness only in 1956 and became non-operational in 1958. It was then taken over by the US Air Force who had a microwave relay station built on site. The underground section of the station, though no longer in use by this time, was later damaged by fire in 1969. The 1963 film The Damned used the station as the Edgecliff Military Establishment. Having used the site as a dog training centre during the 1990s, the Ministry of Defence sold the former station in 2001. The site was then used primarily as horse stables. In 2011, Fancy's Family Farm, a community farm based on the island, relocated to the station from Southwell. Owned by Su and Jon Illsley, the couple pursued the farm as a hobby to look after rare breed Portland sheep. It developed as a popular community farm, but had to relocate in 2011 after the Illsleys faced eviction from the original site. The farm moved to the station during June 2011, and the grassland site was then tidied, with the former USAF building refurbished to become the farm's main centre of operations. The farm opened on 1 April 2012.http://www.fancysfarm.co.uk/ On the \\"News\\" page In recent years, the site has been listed on Historic England's \\"Heritage at Risk\\" register. It is described as having \\"extensive significant problems\\". In 2013, a one-off event was set up to allow Subterranea Britannica members to enter the underground section of the station. The bunker was then sealed and alarmed due to copper thefts in previous years. Design The enclosed site is accessed to the west, with a former guardhouse located at the entrance. Within the enclosure is the former guardroom, which is a single storey building, resembling a bungalow. It provided the access to the bunker, which contained the station's control centre. The site was originally equipped with seven radar towers, now dismantled. The operations block of reinforced concrete was designed to withstand 2,000 lb bombs. A large reservoir on the site provided water to the bunker. The bunker still retains its original air conditioning plant, fans, mains transformer, blast doors, electrical switchgear and rotary converters. There is more original equipment at the station than in any other surviving R1 or R2 ROTOR bunkers. In addition, it is the only ROTOR bunker to retain the original 'Phase 1' layout. The 1969 fire saw much damage inflicted on the main operations room, while other areas also have remaining soot. On ground level, six radar plinths remain intact together with the emergency exit blockhouse and the old USAF compound.

Hungarian community Hungarian American Athletic Club For much of the 20th century the neighborhood was the heart of the Hungarian-American community. Around the turn of the 20th century, New Brunswick began attracting a Hungarian immigrant population who primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson & Johnson and United Cigar factories. The population continued to grow and many settled mainly in the Fifth Ward and abutting neighborhoods. During the Cold War, the community was revitalized by refugees from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution who had initially been housed at Camp Kilmer in nearby Piscataway and Edison. Many soccer teams composed of Hungarians, including the New Brunswick Hungarian Americans, were part of the German-American Soccer League. While much the Hungarian population has relocated to the suburbs and been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, many institutions founded by the community remain active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Bank, Magyar Reformed Church, Ascension Lutheran Church, St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva Montessori Preschool, Sz√©chenyi Hungarian Community School & Kindergarten, Teleki P√°l Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences, Hungarian Alumni Association, Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, and Cs≈±rd√∂ng√∂l≈ë Folk Dance Ensemble. Several landmarks in the area also testify to its Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a recreation park named after Lajos Kossuth, the famous leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where the first ever statue of Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty was erected. A nearby stone memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was dedicated in 2006. The Hungarian Festival is held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday of June each year.

It is the third film based on the manga Crows by Hiroshi Takahashi. It is the sequel to 2009's Crows Zero 2. It features new characters and an almost entirely new cast, including Masahiro Higashide and Taichi Saotome. The film was released in Japan on April 12, 2014. Plot Kaburagi Kazeo is a new transfer student at Suzuran All-Boys High School. While walking to school, he witnesses a group of students get clipped by a passing town car. He arrives just in time for the ‚Äúopening ceremony‚Äù, a showdown between Goura Toru, the school's number one fighter, and another student. The fracas is interrupted by the arrival of Kagami Ryohei, another transfer student, whose arrogance immediately draws the ire of the crowd. Recognizing his vehicle as the town car from earlier, Kazeo confronts Ryohei, who ignores him and walks away. Before he can follow, Kazeo is attacked by another student, Wajima, whom he promptly knocks out with a single punch. At the Doberman Bar, former mob enforcer Katagiri Ken enjoys a drink while trying to keep a low profile. He encounters Makise Takashi, whom he implores to forget they saw each other. Makise instead ropes Ken into coming to work with him at a local auto dealer. Back at Suzuran, Kazeo is approached by Ogisu Kenichi, who explains that since beating Wajima at the opening ceremony, Kazeo has been ranked as the school's number five fighter. He goes on to suggest that Kazeo might be a contender to take on Goura for the top spot, and that they should join forces. Kazeo rejects the idea, asserting that he has no interest in conquering Suzuran. Meanwhile, Ryohei begins taking on challengers, and proves to be a skilled fighter himself. Later, at the bar, Kazeo and Kenichi get into a scrap with Shibata Hiroki, the top fighter from neighboring Kurosaki Industrial High. Back at the Nakata dealership, Ken is adjusting well to his new life as a salesman, and has become smitten with the owner, Aya. However, he soon discovers that the local mob is trying to force the shop out in order to redevelop the land. To protect Aya and the business, Ken goes to see the mob boss, Mr. Nara, who refuses to stop pursuing the Nakata property. During the meeting, Ken encounters Fujiwara, a former Kurosaki student turned mob recruit, as well Ryohei. Having known Ryohei's father from his former profession, Ken is disheartened to learn that Ryohei is now being groomed as Nara's successor. Kazeo visits the cemetery accompanied by his mother, with whom he has a strained relationship. It is revealed that his father was a professional boxer who died due to injuries sustained during a match, and that his mother subsequently developed problems with drinking and gambling. The next day, Ken comes to Suzuran to find Ryohei but runs into Kazeo, with whom he shares stories of his youth at the school. Fujiwara is sent on behalf of the Nara Gang to harass the Nakata shop. He also begins stirring up conflict between Kurosaki and Suzuran as revenge against Shibata, with whom he holds a grudge following an incident which landed Fujiwara in prison. His plan pays off, as an enraged Goura begins attacking Kurosaki students in retaliation. Goura soon learns that Ryohei and Fujiwara are acquainted, but is stabbed by a Kurosaki student. Shibata confronts Fujiwara, but is defeated and left with a broken arm. Ryohei and his gang begin relentless assaults at Suzuran, resulting in Kenichi being hospitalized. The injured Goura challenges Ryohei, but is also defeated, and Ryohei is named Suzuran's top fighter. Later, Fujiwara and Ryohei return to the Nakata shop to shut it down once and for all, setting fire to the building. Escaping the blaze, Ken seeks out Kazeo and begs him to stop Ryohei, for his own good. Spurred on by the escalating violence, Kazeo assembles his own force to take back the school. Kazeo leads his gang, joined by Goura, to confront Ryohei and Fujiwara. Despite his injury, Goura singlehandedly dispatches many opponents before taking on Fujiwara himself, where he quickly loses the upper hand. As Fujiwara prepares to finish Goura, Shibata arrives. Noticing burns on Shibata‚Äôs chest that he caused, Fujiwara admits that he had deserved to have been punished for his actions; he apologizes to Shibata and retreats. Kazeo finally clashes with Ryohei, and after an intense and lengthy battle, he emerges victorious. Ken arrives soon after and whisks the battered Ryohei off for treatment, and away from the influence of the Nara Gang. Sometime later, the Nakata auto shop has been renovated and is a thriving business again. Kazeo, having become the number one fighter and united the school, faces down the final obstacle on his path to completely conquering Suzuran - the indomitable Rindaman. The film ends as their battle begins.

In 1906, he obtained his bachelor's degree at Stellenbosch University and then studied at the Free University of Amsterdam and Princeton. From 1913 to 1938 he was a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in Johannesburg East, called Irene Church. In June 1938, he became a minister in Pretoria East. From 1934 to 1948 he was the moderator of the Dutch Reformed Synod of the Transvaal. In Johannesburg, he was a champion for the recognition of the Afrikaans language and the establishment of Afrikaans- medium schools. Nicol was the founder of Johannesburg East's parish magazine, Irenenuus, in January 1923, that he wanted the members in their particular situation escorted to their faith. It was written in Afrikaans in a time when the language just started gaining a foothold in schools and was rarely heard from the pulpit. Nicol in August 1923 (date uncertain) made history when he wrote the first sermon in Afrikaans broadcast on the radio directly into the radio studios in downtown Johannesburg. At 9:45 on Sunday, 7 June 1924, the minister and church made history when full service was held in Afrikaans for the first time. He also broadcast on the Union broadcast and from Irene Hall. A month later, on 4 October 1925, the first communion service was broadcast from Irene Hall led by Nicol. He was chairman of the Afrikaner Broederbond from 1924-1925. On 1 November 1948 he was elected as the administrator of Transvaal and ten years later his work, especially with regard to education and culture, continued to grow. He retired on 1 October 1958. Nicol believed in teaching education in the person's mother tongue and said any education taught in a second language would hinder a persons growth and learning ability. Thus he also helped translate the Bible with help from African religious leaders into Zulu. He opposed the National Party's Bantu Education and suggested a model with learning in the mother tongue with English as a second language so that people could all communicate.

He served as engraver and later joint Master of the Mint, and as Sheriff and Lord Mayor of London. While Lord Mayor he entertained ambassadors from Scotland, and was among those who welcomed Catherine of Aragon to England. He is mentioned in a poem by William Dunbar. Family John Shaa was the son of John Shaa of Rochford, Essex, and the nephew and eventual heir of Sir Edmund Shaa, Lord Mayor of London in 1482, whose son, Hugh Shaa, had died without male issue. Shaa was also the nephew of Ralph Shaa (d.1484), noted for having preached a sermon at Paul's Cross impugning the legitimacy of Edward IV's children, including his heir, Edward V. Shaa had a sister, Elizabeth (d. 21 August 1503), who married William Poyntz (d.1504), esquire, of North Ockendon, Essex, by whom she had four sons and two daughters.According to Richardson, she was the sister of Sir Edmund Shaa. Career James IV of Scotland, whose ambassadors Sir John Shaa entertained as Lord Mayor Catherine of Aragon, whom Sir John Shaa, as Lord Mayor, welcomed to London Shaa was a London goldsmith. From 1462 until 1483 his uncle, Edmund, also a goldsmith, had been engraver to the Royal Mint. Sir John Shaa succeeded him in the post, and served for several years as engraver until on 20 November 1492 he and his fellow goldsmith, Sir Bartholomew Rede, were appointed joint Masters of the Mint. Shaa's sales of silver and gold plate to Henry VII are recorded in the privy purse expenses, and on two occasions he was also paid for furnishing Georges for the Order of the Garter. His financial dealings with Henry VII were on a considerable scale. On 13 January 1499 he was reimbursed ¬£667 2s 11d for supplying New Year's gifts and for the 'making of divers jewels and setting and polishing of stones', as well as for funds supplied to 'Master Seymour' for the 'works at Windsor'. Shaa was elected Member of Parliament for City of London in 1495 and Sheriff of London in 1496-7,Beaven, Alfred B., The Aldermen of the City of London, Vol. II (London: Eden Fisher & Co.

In 1501 Shaa was elected Lord Mayor. During his term of office, ambassadors were sent from Scotland to arrange the marriage of Henry VII's elder daughter, Margaret Tudor, with James IV, King of Scotland. At a banquet hosted by Shaa for the ambassadors in Christmas week in December 1501, the poet William Dunbar declaimed verses in honour of the City of London which included these lines in praise of Shaa: London, thou art of Townes A per se . . . Thy famous Maire, by pryncely governaunce, With swerd of justice, thee rulith prudently. No Lord of Parys, Venyce, or Floraunce In dignytie or honoure goeth to hym nye. He is exempler, loode-ster, and guye; Principall patrone and roose orygynalle, Above all Maires as maister moost worthy: London, thou art the flour of Cities all.'' During Shaa's term as Lord Mayor, Catherine of Aragon arrived in London as the bride of Henry VII's eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales. Shaa was part of the deputation of London civic authorities and members of the livery companies who were instructed to meet her ship 'in their several barges, after their manner accustomed, at Deptford', and to 'hail and salute her in the best manner they can'.. While he was Lord Mayor, Shaa instituted a 'court of requests' in the City of London to administer justice more equitably. It proved unpopular, as it was said to have favoured the poor more than 'justice and good law required'.Justice in the City Retrieved 23 June 2013. During his term as Lord Mayor, Shaa caused a kitchen to be added to the London Guildhall. He was said to have been 'the first that kept his feast there'. He also instituted another tradition, the procession from the Guildhall to the state barge on which the Lord Mayor travelled to Westminster to be sworn. Shaa was appointed for a second term as MP in 1503, though as Parliament did not assemble until 25 January 1504 he may have died before attending. He made his will on 26 December 1503, which was proved 14 May 1504, and was buried in the Mercers' chapel in the church of St Thomas of Acres.

The mixtape has guest appearances from fellow rappers Bun B, Future, Trinidad James, Wiz Khalifa, Smoke DZA, and Big Sant. The production was handled almost entirely by Big K.R.I.T. himself, with producer 9th Wonder being the only other contributor. The mixtape was released to both DatPiff and LiveMixtapes and as of June 23, 2013, it has been downloaded over 200,000 times on the former. On October 21, 2014, Nature Sounds released the physical version of King Remembered in Time. The mixtape was included as part of the collection The Underground Edition, which also included his previous mixtapes K.R.I.T. Wuz Here, 4eva N a Day and Return of 4eva issued on vinyl, cassette and compact disc. Background Big K.R.I.T. first announced King Remembered In Time on January 10, 2013, revealing that compared to his previous works, this mixtape would have producers aside from himself. He also revealed that he had been working with producer Mike WiLL Made It on the project. Promotion In promotion of the album, Big K.R.I.T. released three songs prior to the album's release. The first track, entitled \\"Reign On\\" featured production from 9th Wonder and was released on February 14, 2013. It was later used in an advertisement for Crown Royal whiskey. On February 27, he released the first official single for the mixtape, \\"Shine On\\" featuring Bun B. Finally, on March 11, he released a black-and-white music video for the song, \\"R.E.M.\\". Following the mixtape's release, it was announced that Big K.R.I.T. would go on an eight stop tour, entitled the \\"King Remembered In Time Tour\\", from May 24 to June 1. He was joined by Smoke DZA and Clyde Carson on the tour. On July 18, Big K.R.I.T. released a Chopped and Screwed remix version of the mixtape by Michael \\"5000\\" Watts.  Critical response  King Remembered In Time received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release. *Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX stated that, \\"With 'King Remembered In Time,' Big K.R.I.T. takes on the title of his bold namesake and gives a performance that strengthens his core following.\\" He went on to add that, \\"K.R.I.T. has unmistakably progressed as a lyricist, and his latest project illustrates this thoroughly with the memorizing licks of 'R.E.M.' and 'Meditate,' as well as the haunting visuals on 'Banana Clip Theory.' Detailing the devastation brought on by gun violence, Big K.R.I.T. twists rhymes as he attests, 'I heard a gun the other day, it spoke to me and told me power / Was the only thing that we could lose, so don't be afraid to let it shower.'\\" However, he also added that, \\"If there‚Äôs an inadequacy to point out on King Remembered In Time, it would be a slight dip in execution from its predecessors. Whereas Return of 4Eva and 4eva N a Day flowed smoothly between tracks, an unsettling snippet like the Future-assisted 'Just Last Week' or his staggered cadence on 'WTF' stymies an otherwise outstanding track list. Similarly, his hook game hasn‚Äôt developed much. In the past he‚Äôs gotten away with terse lines on 'Yeah Dats Me' and 'Sookie Now' off the strength of his zeal, but shouting, 'What the fuck we gonna do now?' and 'How you love that?' incessantly isn‚Äôt the most creative way to keep someone engaged.\\" Ortiz went on to give the mixtape a rating of \\"free album\\", which is HipHopDX's highest possible rating for a mixtape. *Reed Jackson of XXL noted a change in the way the album was produced from K.R.I.T.'s previous works, stating that, \\"A noticeable change here is K.R.I.T.‚Äôs willingness to expand his production style. His beats have always been appealing ‚Äì warm and organic, similar to those produced by Organized Noize in the mid 90s during Dungeon Family‚Äôs reign.\\" Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound gave the mixtape a 3.5/5 stating that, \\"Big K.R.I.T.‚Äôs finest moments, however, come when he‚Äôs at his most sincere. The brooding 'Meditate' is a song about retreating from your loved ones and holing up alone for a while. It‚Äôs not entirely unhealthy, though K.R.I.T. feels ashamed for leaving their sides. On 'Bigger Picture', he glances into the future and offers a realist‚Äôs advice ‚Äî 'Shit might suck, but you gotta push on.' That self-awareness and perseverance are what got him here.\\" *Mike Madden of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 6.8/10 rating, stating that, \\"Despite the mixtape's major features (Bun B, Wiz Khalifa, Future), its interesting risk- taking (there‚Äôs a James Blake sample on 'REM'), and the music's spit-shined mastering job that recalls Rick Ross‚Äôs triumphant Rich Forever, the new King Remembered in Time doesn‚Äôt try to deliver on that promise. Instead of feeling like a definitive pinpointing of the spot K.R.I.T.‚Äôs at right now, King sounds more like a checkpoint halfway between where he‚Äôs been and where he wants to go.\\" On December 24, 2013, XXL named it the tenth best mixtape of the year, saying \\"the project again helped anchor K.R.I.T‚Äôs place in the rap game.\\"http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/the-25-best-mixtapes-of-2013/5/ Track listing *All tracks produced by Big K.R.I.T. except Life Is A Gamble which is produced by 9th Wonder References Category:2013 mixtape albums Category:Big K.R.I.T. albums Category:Albums produced by Big K.R.I.T.

They share text with the related Annales Tiliani, Annales Laubacenses and Annales Petaviani, all originating in monasteries of the region of Belgica and having terse, somewhat sporadic entries. The Annales sancti Amandi was preserved in a now lost manuscript that also contained Bede's De ratione temporum.Graeme Dunphy, \\"Annales Sancti Amandi\\", Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Brill, 2010). Retrieved 23 June 2013 from BrillOnline Reference Works. This manuscript was copied in 1638 by Andr√© Duchesne, and his copy is the one upon which all subsequent editions are based.Rosamond McKitterick, The Frankish Kingdoms under the Carolingians, 751‚Äì987 (London: Longman, 1983), 2‚Äì3. According to Rosamond McKitterick, the Annales sancti Amandi are probably the earliest Frankish annals. According to Graeme Dunphy, the annals appear to be the product of three different Carolingian authors, the work of the first covering the years 687‚Äì770, that of the second 771‚Äì91 and that of the third 782‚Äì810. The first annal of 687 concerns the battle of Tertry, at which the Carolingian ancestor Pippin of Heristal defeated his aristocratic rivals. The final annal of 810 records Charlemagne taking an army into Saxony and holding a public assembly (placitum) at a place called Fereda, where the Wends came and submitted to him.Georg Pertz, ed., \\"Annales Sancti Amandi, Tiliani, Laubacenses et Petaviani\\", in MGH Scriptores 1 (Hanover, 1826), 3‚Äì18. Under 789 the annal provides an early example of the restricted geographic sense of the term \\"Neustria\\": by that time it referred only to the land between the Loire and the Seine.Herwig Wolfram, \\"The Shaping of the Early Medieval Principality as a Type of Non-royal Rulership\\", Viator 2 (1971): 44. The Annales sancti Amandi are peroccupied with the secular world and notices on church- or monastery- related events are presented unsystematically and seemingly at random. The work cannot have been intended to create a history for the monastic community; its main concern is with turbulence and conflict in the secular realm.Steven Vanderputten, \\"Typology of Medieval Historiography Reconsidered: a Social Re- interpretation of Monastic Annals, Chronicles and Gesta\\", Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung 26, 4(98) (2001): 159. The Annales sancti Amandi are not to be confused with the Annales sancti Amandi breves and Annales sancti Amandi brevissimi, sets of briefer annals compiled as marginal notes in other manuscripts from the same monastery. The first brevissimi (\\"very brief\\") entry, for 760, is just \\"solar eclipse\\" (eclipsis solis). Its last, for 796, is \\"Pope Adrian died\\" (Adrianus papa obit), although he actually died on 25 December 795. These annals accompany an Easter table for the years 760‚Äì97.Georg Waitz, ed., \\"Annales Sancti Amandi Brevissimi\\", in MGH Scriptores 13 (Hanover, 1881), 38. The breves (\\"briefs\\") consist in a series of notes for the years 742 to 855 beside an Easter table covering the years 741 to 941.

In the 19th century it was home to Robert Warren and Arthur Guinness and is a protected structure in Dublin.History from Manresa.ie, retrieved 22 June 2013 History =Origins= Manresa House is a stately home that has had a series of different owners. It was originally known as Granby Hall, and then Baymount Castle and included 17 acres of land surrounding the house. Until 1783, it was a residence of the Bishop of Down and Connor, James Traill. In 1838, it was renovated by Robert Warren. Soon after, it became the property of the Sisters of Loreto who used it as a school. In 1851, it was renovated by the sisters, because the building was damaged by a serious fire that year. In 1898, they sold it to Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun and moved to Balbriggan. =Use as a Preparatory School= In around 1904 William Scott opened a school on the premises called Baymount Preparatory School, of which he was headmaster until 1936. The school was then acquired by John Tudor Gwynn, who ran it until 1948. John T Gwynn was a descendant of John Gwynn and a member of the Gwynn family that included noted literary figures such as Stephen Gwynn and Edward Gwynn. =Establishment of Spirituality Centre= In 1948, the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid asked the Jesuits to establish a spirituality centre in the Dollymount area, so they bought Baymount Castle. They renamed it Manresa House after Manresa in Catalonia, Spain, where St Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits had many spiritual experiences that contributed to formulation of his Spiritual Exercises.Manresa Spirituality Centre from Jesuit.ie, retrieved 22 June 2013 The Retreat Centre The first retreat was held there in 1949. In 1966, a new separate house to was built to accommodate more retreatants and was opened in 1967. In 1969, the Irish Jesuits moved their novitiate from Emo Court in County Laois to a building within the grounds of Manresa House. In 1977, part of the property, near the novitiate, was sold to developers to build a housing estate. In 1991, the novitiate moved to Dublin. In 2006, a new building was built on the site of the old novitiate for the Tertianship of the Jesuits in Europe.

Their main themes are machine learning, data mining, and computational intelligence algorithms applied to biological and biostatistical problems. The CIBB conference was originally started by Francesco Masulli (Universit√† di Genova), Antonina Starita (Universit√† di Pisa), and Roberto Tagliaferri (Universit√† di Salerno) as a special session within other international conferences held in Italy: the 14th Italian Workshop on Neural Networks (2004), the 6th International Workshop on Fuzzy Logic and Applications (2005), the 7th International Fuzzy Logic and Intelligent Technologies in Nuclear Science Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence (2006), and the 7th International Workshop on Fuzzy Logic and Applications (2007). Because of the broad participation of researchers to the CIBB special session at the latter meeting, which included twenty-six submitted papers, the CIBB steering committee decided to turn CIBB into an autonomous conference starting with the 2008 edition in Vietri sul Mare, Italy.CIBB 2015 Conference proceedings - CIBB history (PDF) During their first editions, the CIBB conferences were organized and attended mainly by Italian researchers at various academic locations throughout Italy.

In 2011, based on strategic insight, LtCol. Thomas Atkinson, Strategic Plans Officer for USMARFORAF, created SPMAGTF-AF with funding from USAFRICOM and USMARFORCOM. The SPMAGTF-AF initially consisted of 120 specially trained Marines from 4th Force Reconnaissance Co. and ACE support. The TE included two KC-130 aircraft vehicles and trucks. SPMAGTF-12 (see external link below), the first rotation was trained in Limited Crisis Response, Humanitarian Aid, and Host Nation Support in Africa. SPMAGTF Marines were trained in embassy reinforcement and stationed out of NAS Sigonella, Sicily, for timely response in Africa. In 2012, the highly successful SPMAGTF was replicated in every COCOM globally. In 2013, following the 2012 Benghazi attack, Lt. Gen. Richard Tryon, Marine Corps deputy commandant for plans, policies and operations, announced the creation of a larger Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force that could fly in a company of Marines on Bell Boeing MV-22B Ospreys to respond to crises in Africa. However, this will require political work to secure a ground base nearby that the amphibious ships operating in the global commons of the world's oceans do not require. The task force self-deployed to Mor√≥n Air Base on 27 April 2013. USMC spokesman Capt. Eric Flanagan has listed the responsibilities of the task force to be a first responder for American embassies in the area, to help evacuate Americans, and to provide humanitarian and disaster relief. In June, elements of the unit went to Italy during the 100th anniversary of Italian naval aviation where they showcased the U.S. Marine Corps' MV-22B Osprey.Atwell, Lukas, \\"Crisis Response Marines familiarize Italian naval aviation leaders with Osprey\\", June 28, 2013 In July 2013, Col. Scott F. Benedict, the commander of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, took over command of SP-MAGTF Crisis Response and brought much of his staff from the 24th MEU. As of July, SP-MAGTF Crisis Response consisted of a Command Element from the 24th MEU, a Ground Combat Element (GCE) from Bravo Company, 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, based out of Camp Lejeune, N.C.; an Aviation Combat Element (ACE) from Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365 (VMM-365) out of New River, N.C.; and a small Logistics Combat Element (LCE) from the 2nd Marine Logistics Group, also from Camp Lejeune. One of the primary objectives of the new commander was to establish relationships among American and foreign military and civilian leaders within Spain and the surrounding area. To this end, the unit conducted a bilateral exercise from July 29 to Aug. 1, when infantry Marines trained alongside Spanish paratroopers from the Brigada de Infanter√≠a Ligera Paracaidista at the Principe Training Camp near Uceda, Spain.Larson, Joshua W., \\"Newest Marine unit trains with Spanish soldiers\\", Aug. 1, 2013 Later that month, there was another bilateral event as the GCE again joined Spanish paratroopers and U.S. Sailors for a free-fall training exercise near Naval Station Rota Spain, August 12‚Äì16.Larson, Joshua W. \\"Marine Crisis Response force hosts free-fall exercise with Spanish paratroopers\\", Aug. 16, 2013 Marines and Sailors with SPMAGTF Crisis Response ‚Äì Africa board a KC-130J Super Hercules to travel to Liberia from Dakar, Senegal, to support Operation United Assistance, Oct. 9, 2014. Between August and September, the unit saw its aviation and infantry units conduct turnovers as VMM-162 replaced VMM-365 as the ACE, and Alpha Company replaced Bravo Company (both from 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion) as the GCE. Shortly after, on Sept. 25, the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Mr. James Costos, visited Mor√≤n and received a brief regarding the capabilities of the force and a ride in an Osprey. From Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, SP-MAGTF Crisis Response Marines flew north to Camp des Garrigues near N√Æmes, France, to take part in a bilateral training event with French Legionnaires with the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment. The five-day event aimed at developing a working relationship with the French military and was the first event between SP-MAGTF Crisis Response and the French. The training was also historically significant because it was the first time an MV-22B Osprey landed and operated in a tactical environment on French soil. The Osprey had only been in France once before, at the 1995 Paris Air Show in Le Bourget. Another significant event in November was the insert of personnel to Dakar, Senegal, Nov. 13.Hyland, Sharon, \\"Marines conduct long-range flight into Senegal\\", Dec. 12, 2013 The mission consisted of the movement of a contingent of Marines from SP-MAGTF Africa using SP-MAGTF Crisis Response Ospreys and a KC-130J Hercules. The movement was over 1,500 nautical miles and marked the first time Osprey aircraft landed in West Africa. There was a static display and demonstration flight for those in attendance, which included the U.S. Ambassador to Senegal, Mr. Lewis Lukens, and senior members of the Senegalese military. In January 2014 the SPMAGTF-CR operated out of Entebbe, Uganda to evacuate American staff in response to the South Sudan conflict. In March 2014, Spain agreed to an expansion to 850 marines and an extension of the mission for another year. In April 2014, Commandant Amos said that the USMC was to attempt to move the unit down to the Gulf of Guinea over the next two years. In May 2014, a 200 Marine detachment was again sent to Sigonella in response to \\"a deteriorating security situation in North Africa\\". In October 2014, Marines and Sailors with SPMAGTF Crisis Response Africa traveled to Liberia from Dakar, Senegal, to support OPERATION UNITED ASSISTANCE. The operation is part of a comprehensive U.S. Government effort, led by the U.S. Agency for International Development, to respond to and contain the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa as quickly as possible.http://www.marines.mil/Photos.aspx?igphoto=2000948294 In 2015 the United States and Spain agreed on a permanent agreement for use of the base to replace the year-to-year terms the task force had been operating under.http://www.newsday.com/news/world/spain-makes-us-rapid-force-at-moron- base-permanent-1.10486681 \\"Spain makes US rapid force at Moron base permanent\\", Newsday In July 2015, SPMAGTF-CR-AF 15.2 took authority for operations under the command of Col Cal L. Worth Jr. of the 6th Marine Regiment, 2d Marine Division. Col Worth's regiment staff composes the body of the CE. The ACE is Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261 (VMM-261), 2d Marine Air Wing; the GCE is the 3d Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2d Marine Division; and the LCE is Combat Logistics Battalion-6, 2d Marine Logistics Group. All units are from the II Marine Expeditionary Force based aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In September 2015 SPMAGTF-CR- AF will deploy aboard various allied ships in Exercise Trident Juncture. In 2017 half of the unit's V-22s will be taken away for training.

One based in the United States for United States Marine Corps Forces, South, and another in Bahrain for United States Marine Forces Central Command. However the Congress is considered unlikely to vote for the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative funding needed. The United States House Committee on Armed Services voted to transfer the needed funds from operations and maintenance accounts instead, risking a hollow force. In 2014 SP-MAGTF Central Command deployed a two thousand Marine force to the Persian Gulf with their aircraft. SP-MAGTF- CR-CC will remain on call for recovery of downed allied pilots conducting airstrikes during Operation Inherent Resolve. In June 2015 the 250 Marines of Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-South are scheduled to deploy to four Central American countries.

Career In 1918, Krzycki ran for the United States House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 8th congressional district. He lost to incumbent Edward E. Browne. In 1924, he was a candidate for the House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 4th congressional district. He lost to incumbent John C. Schafer. Krzycki ran for the United States Senate in 1926, losing to John J. Blaine. He then ran for Secretary of State of Wisconsin in 1928, losing to incumbent Theodore Dammann. In 1933, he was elected Chairman of the Socialist Party of America. Krzycki's involvement in the strike of about 1,500 people against the Republic Steel plant was criticized, especially the \\"march\\" forward that the strikers took towards the plant gates. One first-hand account stated that he knew beforehand that the police captain was a \\"sadist\\" and stayed on-stage, trying in vain to dissuade the protests from going forward.Arthur G. McDowell.

It is associated with the proverb \\"God helps those who help themselves\\", variations on which are found in other ancient Greek authors. The Greek proverb ‚ÄùTry first thyself, and after call the gods‚Äù, Hermes and Athena in a Prague Castle fresco A number of the fables credited to Aesop seem to have been created to illustrate already existing proverbs.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable, Leiden NL 1999, vol.1, pp.205-9 The tale of Herakles and the Cowherd, first recorded by Babrius towards the end of the 1st century CE, is one of these. The rustic's cart falls into a ravine and he calls on the deified strongman for help, only to be advised by a voice from Heaven to put his own shoulder to the wheel first. In a variant recorded by the near contemporary Zenobius an ass founders in the mud, while in the later Latin of Avianus it is a cart drawn by oxen that gets stuck there. The fable appears as number 291 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site Another fable of the same tendency is numbered 30 in that index. It tells of a man who is shipwrecked and calls on the goddess Athena for help; he is advised by another to try swimming ('moving his arms') as well.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-Latin Fable, Leiden NL 2003, volume 3, p.43 Evidence that the advice on which they close is old and probably of proverbial origin is provided by its appearance in ancient Greek tragedies, of which only fragments now remain. In the Philoctetes (c.409 BCE) of Sophocles appear the lines, \\"No good e'er comes of leisure purposeless; And heaven ne‚Äôer helps the men who will not act.\\"As translated by E. H. Plumptre in Sophocles: Tragedies and Fragments volume 2, p165, fragment 288. Also fragment 302 states, \\"Chance never helps the men who do not work.\\" And in the Hippolytus (428 BCE) of Euripides there is the more direct, \\"Try first thyself, and after call in God; For to the worker God himself lends aid.\\"John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations, 10th ed. 1919. #8500, Hippolytus, fragment 435 Later applications When the theme was taken up in the Renaissance, it was the variant of the laden ass that slips in the mire that appeared earlier on in Guillaume La Perri√®re's emblem book, Le theatre des bons engins (1544) . Though prayer to God is piously recommended in the accompanying poem, ::Yet while to Him you carry your trust, ::Let your own hands tarry not at first.Emblem 95, French Emblems in Glasgow Not long after, Gabriele Faerno included the story of Hercules and the Wagoner in his influential collection of Latin poems based on Aesop's fables that was published in 1563.Centum Fabulae 91 Then in England Francis Barlow provided versions in English verse and Latin prose to accompany the illustration in his 1666 collection of the fables under the title \\"The Clown and the Cart\\".Aesopica site Two years later, a French version appeared in La Fontaine's Fables titled \\"The Mired Carter\\" (Le chartier embourb√©, VI.18). The variation in this telling is that the god suggests various things that the carter should do until, to his surprise, he finds that the cart is freed. The first translation of this version was made by Charles Denis in 1754, and there he follows La Fontaine in incorporating the Classical proverb as the moral on which it ends: \\"First help thyself, and Heaven will do the rest.\\"Select Fables, fable 92 The English idiomatic expression 'to set (or put) one's shoulder to the wheel' derived at an earlier date from the condition given the carter before he could expect divine help.M.

It was not there in Samuel Croxall's long 'application' at the end of his version, in which he stated that to neglect the necessity of self-help is ‚Äòblasphemy‚Äô, that it is ‚Äòa great sin for a man to fail in his trade or occupation by running often to prayers‚Äô, and that 'the man who is virtuously and honestly engaged is actually serving God all the while‚Äô.Fables of Aesop, Fable 56 A century after the first appearance of his collection, the fables were reused with new commentaries in Aesop's fables: accompanied by many hundred proverbs & moral maxims suited to the subject of each fable (Dublin 1821). There it is titled \\"The Farmer and the Carter\\" and headed with the maxim 'If you will obtain, you must attempt'. At the end, a Biblical parallel is suggested with ‚ÄòThe soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing‚Äô from the Book of Proverbs (13.4).pp. 71-2 Later in that century, George Fyler Townsend preferred to end his new translation with the pithy 'Self-help is the best help'.Fable 12 References External links *Book illustrations of Aesop's fable from the 18th-19th centuries *Illustrations of La Fontaine's fable from the 18th-19th centuries Hercules and the Wagoner Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Heracles in fiction Category:Proverbs ","title":"Hercules and the Wagoner"},{"id":"39758267","text":"Marcus Adams may refer to: * Marcus Adams (director), British film director * Marcus Adams (photographer) (1875‚Äì1959), British society photographer * Marcus Adams (Canadian football) (born 1979), Canadian football defensive tackle * Marcus Adams (footballer) (born 1993), Australian Football League defender See also * Marcus Adam (born 1968), English athlete *Mark Adams (disambiguation) ","title":"Marcus Adams"},{"id":"39758270","text":"Orthops campestris is a species of plant bugs belonging to the family Miridae, subfamily Mirinae, that can be found everywhere in Europe except for Azores, Faroe Islands, Iceland and African islands such as Canary Islands and Cyprus. and across the Palearctic to Central Asia and Siberia.

In 1979 he won the German Triple Crown and is the first horse that won all the races necessary for this crown. Since 1979 no other horse has won the crown. In addition to racing success, he was named German horse of 1979 and was German champion sire in 1988 and 1994. Background K√∂nigsstuhl was a black/darkbay thoroughbred. The stallion was born at the stud Zoppenbroich in West Germany. He was a son of Dschingis Khan (1961‚Äì1986) (Tamerlane -Donna Diana) and his dam was K√∂nigskr√∂nung (1958-‚Ä† ) (Tiepoletto-Kr√∂nung). His dam K√∂nigskr√∂nung was a great distance horse during her racing career, but also a big horse. Her first foals were much too big for a racing career. Kurt Bresges, the stud manager and owner of stud Zoippenbroich, made some stud experiments before he took a small stallion for his big mare. On 17 May 1976 a black/darkbay colt was born. K√∂nigsstuhl was not a beauty in his young years. He had problems with his legs and had also a big head. The farrier gave him position help for hoof correction. In October 1977, Bresges died. His wife had to take over the stud management. She gave all yearlings and also K√∂nigsstuhl to horse trainer Sven von Mitzlaff. Bresges sold most of the yearlings, but Mitzlaff advised her to keep K√∂nigsstuhl. So the horse remained in possession. In August 1995 he died of colic. Racing career His racing career was from 1978 to 1981. K√∂nigsstuhl started 20 times and won eleven races. He raced in Germany and Italy. In June 1978 K√∂nigsstuhl started his racing career. He ran in a German trail run (Versuchsrennen der Hengste, K√∂ln) about 1.000 m and came in second after My Rocket (Rocket - Macoletta). Next he won his maiden race: Limbo-Rennen Gelsenkirchen ‚Äì 1200 m. In spring 1979 he qualified for the German Derby (Ger-Gr. I 2400m) and won the German 2000-Guineas (Ger-Gr. 2). In the summer of 1979 he won the German Derby (Ger-Gr. 1 2400m). After this he won some important races and in autumn 1979 he won the German St. Leger (Ger- Gr. II 2800m) to complete the German Triple Crown. On 25 October 1980, K√∂nigsstuhl was sent to Italy to contest the Group One Gran Premio del Jockey Club over 2400 metres.

On the same site there is the shared-use Atrium Arts Centre. History The school gained specialist status as an Arts College in 2005. A redevelopment of North Walsham High School, including the opening of a new enterprise centre was completed in summer 2012. Neil Powell was appointed as headteacher in September 2016 and aimed that \\"Within the next three years, North Walsham High School will be rated as an ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù school with students achieving excellent GCSE results.\\" Ofsted visited in late 2018 and the report downgraded the school to 'requiring improvement.' It was critical of legacy issues and governance, noting that the view of school leaders was at odds with those of inspectors. In 2018, 61% of Y11 students achieved a pass grade of 4 or above in English and Maths. Previously a community school administered by Norfolk County Council, in October 2019 North Walsham High School converted to academy status and is now sponsored by the Enrich Learning Trust. In June 2020, during the Coronavirus lockdown a new head was appointed. Mr James Gosden, on appointment, made a far less ambitious pledge: 'to return the school‚Äôs Ofsted rating to ‚Äúgood‚Äù '. Academics Ofsted described this as a smaller than average secondary school serving rural North Norfolk. The parents of the overwhelmingly White British students are deeply resistant to change.The proportion of pupils eligible for the pupil premiumis broadly average. The proportion of pupils with Special educational needs (SEND), including those with an education, health and care plan, is above average. Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'. The school has to decide whether Key Stage 3 contains years 7, 8 and 9- or whether Key Stage 3 should be compressed into 2 years and year 9 should be in Key Stage 4 so the students just study subjects that will be examined by the GCSE exams at 16. North Walsham, and rural Norfolk, has difficulty in attracting teachers and retaining them, so there is a lot of turbulence. It is making the changes demanded by a bad Ofsted report, and in the process has become an academy. The new trust now says \\"Our curriculum is highly personalised and evolves each term to target the needs of all students.\\" They expect that all future students will do exams in four option subjects alongside a core of Maths, English and Science. They have moved to a compressed Key Stage 3 with a three year Key Stage 4. The Atrium The Atrium is a ¬£5.3m arts and education centre which opened in September 2011. Facilities at the Atrium include a theatre, cinema, classrooms, exhibition spaces, rooms for meetings, dance studio for various classes, large carpeted areas for workshops and an auditorium that seats 186 people. The facilities at the Atrium are used primarily by North Walsham High School during the school day, but are open to the wider community of North Walsham and North Norfolk at other times.

Geys is known for his photography, painting, sculpture, films, installation art, publishing activities, and experimentation in art education. Geys grew up in Faytlaan, Leopoldsburg, and attended school at the Brothers of Love. He studied in the Academy of Antwerp under Piet Serneels, Maclot, Dolphyn and Strebelle, then gained a teaching diploma from the state school of Hasselt before starting work teaching in Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe. In 1960, Geys was an appointed Teacher of Positive Aesthetics at a children's school in Balen until he left the position in 1989. The school focused on the educational experimentation in the arts, and included a studio and exhibition space, and arts laboratory. Work Geys is known for the strong social and political motives of his work. He is perhaps best known for his proposal to blow up the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten (KMSKA) in Antwerp in 1971 at the end of his solo exhibition held there. In a letter to the Minister of Culture from November 1970, which was published later in the catalog Ooidonk 78, Geys described his plans about the explosion of the KMSKA as follows: \\"Departing from the idea that every society, authority, institution, organization, person, etc. includes the seeds of its own destruction, the first and most important task of every society, authority, etc. in my opinion is to recognize, isolate and neutralize these seeds. The most efficient way to achieve all this then seems to me to systematically, scientifically and deliberately set about the problem. [‚Ä¶] So I would like to start a project, which, if executed, would result in the destruction of the Museum voor Schone Kunsten.\\"Jef Geys 1978, 'Letter to the Minister of Dutch Culture' (November 11, 1970), in: Ooidonk 78, exh. cat., 101. Kempens Informatieblad In 1971, Geys took on the freely-distributed newspaper Kempens Informatieblad which was a local publication in Kempen, Belgium, which is also called Campine (French). Geys prints and distributes Kempens house-to-house, and often produces them in line with his exhibitions. Geys is also known for having created a meticulous archive of his own work and Kempens since 1958, though the archive has been made inaccessible to all but the artist himself.

It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability. The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a lower probability. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence (KL divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. While the original algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity metric, this can be changed as appropriate. t-SNE has been used for visualization in a wide range of applications, including computer security research, music analysis, cancer research, bioinformatics, and biomedical signal processing. It is often used to visualize high-level representations learned by an artificial neural network.Visualizing Representations: Deep Learning and Human Beings Christopher Olah's blog, 2015 While t-SNE plots often seem to display clusters, the visual clusters can be influenced strongly by the chosen parameterization and therefore a good understanding of the parameters for t-SNE is necessary. Such \\"clusters\\" can be shown to even appear in non- clustered data, and thus may be false findings. Interactive exploration may thus be necessary to choose parameters and validate results. It has been demonstrated that t-SNE is often able to recover well-separated clusters, and with special parameter choices, approximates a simple form of spectral clustering.  Details  Given a set of N high-dimensional objects \\\\mathbf{x}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{x}_N, t-SNE first computes probabilities p_{ij} that are proportional to the similarity of objects \\\\mathbf{x}_i and \\\\mathbf{x}_j, as follows. For i eq j, define : p_{j\\\\mid i} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(-\\\\lVert\\\\mathbf{x}_i - \\\\mathbf{x}_j\\\\rVert^2 / 2\\\\sigma_i^2)}{\\\\sum_{k eq i} \\\\exp(-\\\\lVert\\\\mathbf{x}_i - \\\\mathbf{x}_k\\\\rVert^2 / 2\\\\sigma_i^2)} and set p_{i\\\\mid i} = 0. Note that \\\\sum_j p_{j\\\\mid i} = 1 for all i. As Van der Maaten and Hinton explained: \\"The similarity of datapoint x_j to datapoint x_i is the conditional probability, p_{ji}, that x_i would pick x_j as its neighbor if neighbors were picked in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian centered at x_i.\\" Now define : p_{ij} = \\\\frac{p_{j\\\\mid i} + p_{i\\\\mid j}}{2N} and note that p_{ij} = p_{ji}, p_{ii} = 0 , and \\\\sum_{i, j} p_{ij} = 1. The bandwidth of the Gaussian kernels \\\\sigma_i is set in such a way that the perplexity of the conditional distribution equals a predefined perplexity using the bisection method. As a result, the bandwidth is adapted to the density of the data: smaller values of \\\\sigma_i are used in denser parts of the data space. Since the Gaussian kernel uses the Euclidean distance \\\\lVert x_i-x_j \\\\rVert, it is affected by the curse of dimensionality, and in high dimensional data when distances lose the ability to discriminate, the p_{ij} become too similar (asymptotically, they would converge to a constant). It has been proposed to adjust the distances with a power transform, based on the intrinsic dimension of each point, to alleviate this. t-SNE aims to learn a d-dimensional map \\\\mathbf{y}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{y}_N (with \\\\mathbf{y}_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d) that reflects the similarities p_{ij} as well as possible. To this end, it measures similarities q_{ij} between two points in the map \\\\mathbf{y}_i and \\\\mathbf{y}_j, using a very similar approach. Specifically, for i eq j, define q_{ij} as : q_{ij} = \\\\frac{(1 + \\\\lVert \\\\mathbf{y}_i - \\\\mathbf{y}_j\\\\rVert^2)^{-1}}{\\\\sum_k \\\\sum_{l eq k} (1 + \\\\lVert \\\\mathbf{y}_k - \\\\mathbf{y}_l\\\\rVert^2)^{-1}} and set q_{ii} = 0 . Herein a heavy-tailed Student t-distribution (with one-degree of freedom, which is the same as a Cauchy distribution) is used to measure similarities between low-dimensional points in order to allow dissimilar objects to be modeled far apart in the map. The locations of the points \\\\mathbf{y}_i in the map are determined by minimizing the (non-symmetric) Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence of the distribution P from the distribution Q, that is: : \\\\mathrm{KL}\\\\left(P \\\\parallel Q\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i eq j} p_{ij} \\\\log \\\\frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}} The minimization of the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence with respect to the points \\\\mathbf{y}_i is performed using gradient descent. The result of this optimization is a map that reflects the similarities between the high-dimensional inputs.

Career Born at Reigate, Surrey, Gordon was educated at Winchester College, where he represented the school cricket team, he progressed to study at the University of Oxford. While studying there, he made his debut in first-class cricket for the University Cricket Club against HDG Leveson-Gower's at the University Parks in 1906. Gordon made eight further first-class appearances for the University in that season, scoring 545 runs at an average of 27.35, with a high score of 117, his only first-class century, which came against Surrey. He also made two first-class appearances for Surrey in that seasons County Championship against Warwickshire and Worcestershire. He continued to play for Oxford University in 1907, making a further nine first-class appearances for the team, though he was less successful in this season, scoring 251 runs at an average of 13.94, and a high score of 51. Making a total of eighteen first- class appearances for the University, Gordon scored 678 runs at an average of 19.94. He also made a single appearance for Surrey in that seasons County Championship against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. The following season he played minor counties cricket for Dorset, making a single appearance in the Minor Counties Championship against Berkshire.

It is built to the FIA GT3 regulations, and the cars are raced in a one-make series; the Ginetta GT Supercup. In addition to this, they are also used in the GT3 class of competitions such as the British GT Championship. It was an evolutionary update of the Ginetta G50, which is a GT4-class car. Cup Ginetta Cars announced in November 2010 that they were going to be building a new sports car, and named it as the G55. In February 2011, the car was released, as a more powerful evolution of the G50. The G55 featured a Ford-sourced 3.7 litre V6, producing 370 hp, in addition to a 6-speed sequential manual gearbox, built by Hewland. The new car did not replace the G50; instead, it supplemented it, and the Ginetta G50 Cup was rebranded as the Ginetta GT Supercup. The G55 was available for sale for ¬£75,000, or as an upgrade from the G50 for ¬£25,000. The car made its British GT debut in the Oulton Park rounds of the 2011 season, with four separate entries competing; the best result of the event came courtesy of Century Motorsport, whom took a ninth place finish at the second race of the day. Century Motorsport were also responsible for the car's best finish of the season; a fourth place at Rockingham Motor Speedway, in the first race of the day. A GT3 test mule was run by Rollcentre Racing (using the Cup engine with some GT3-specification components) in the 2011 Britcar 24 Hours; however, the car failed to finish the race. GT3 In 2012, Ginetta introduced a full GT3 version of the G55, which featured a Ginetta Racing-built 4.35 litre V8 engine in place of the Cup's 3.7 litre V6. Previously, they had used the Cup-spec car in GT3 races. Like the Cup car, it used a Hewland-sourced gearbox; however, it features wider wheels than the Cup car. The G55 GT3 made its first appearance at a Donington Park test session. The GT3 car made its competitive debut at the Silverstone round of the Britcar GT series, with Optimum Motorsport entering it; they finished eighth overall, and third in Class 1. The car's first win came at the Donington Park round of the Britcar series; with Team LNT and Optimum Motorsport taking a G55 one-two. A G55 GT3 was used by United Autosports for the 2012 Britcar 24 Hours, with the team entering Richard Dean, Lawrence Tomlinson, Mike Simpson and Tom Kimber-Smith as their drivers. The team contested under the Team LNT banner, and finished 21st overall, and third in Class 1. The G55 GT3 was announced as one of the official cars for Project CARS simulator in August 2012, alongside the G50 and the Ginetta G40 Junior. Ginetta showcased both models of the G55 at the 2013 Autosport International Show. For the 2013 British GT season, IDL Racing announced they would be entering a G55 GT3 in the series (in conjunction with CWS), whilst two Works- run cars were also entered.

Polish prisoners of war in WW2 used to collect their water from the Marshalland springs and it is thought that the old carbonated water factory near Bellscauseway that produced 'cooling and temperance drinks' used these waters.

After many discussions and a Royal Commission investigation, the final plan for a school emerged as a co-educational day school equipped to take a few boarders. The school closed in 1972 when Garnock Academy was opened and after vandalism and structural decay the buildings were demolished in 1984 and the rubble used to fill an old quarry at Lyonshields Farm near Gateside.

The paper \\"Tolkien's Love of Trees and the Envirohnment\\" was first read and discussed at this moot, and later also read and discussed by the U.K. Tolkien Society at their annual Seminar series.This paper originally presented at Tolkien Moot and revised for U.K. Tolkien Society Seminar 2011 The Theme for Tolkienmoot 2011 was \\"Trees\\". The special broadcast guest speaker and talk show segments will be earlier in the day so that more online participants from Europe and elsewhere will not have to be up at 2:00 am their time to participate.

As per requests from the participants, future Moots will resume having themes and providing shared adventures. RPG Game systems: Cubicle 7's The One Ring Roleplaying Game (TOR RPG), ICE's MERP, GURPS for Middle-earth, and Ea d20 (D&D; 3.5 for Middle-earth). The Ea Tolkien Society, an official Smial of the U.K. Tolkien Society, provided the main broadcast and presentation topics.

Both on site and online attendance numbers have continued to increase over each year. Different approaches to the guest speaker segments have been used. The opening speaking session is typically presented by the convention founder, with a \\"state of the union\\" discussion about the current state of Tolkien fandom, role-playing gaming community & industry, and the RPG Research project updates. Other sessions have sometimes been in a format called \\"Raw Hobbit\\", hosted by Tolkien essayist and author Michael Martinez as an homage to William Shatner's Raw Nerve talk show. Other sessions have included the interactive \\"Tolkien Youth Panel\\", while still other sessions generally include notable guest speakers (see list) with local and online audience participation in follow-up Q&A.; The final sessions often overlap with episodes of Middle-earth Talk RadioThe Middle-earth Radio Talk Show Website as a live broadcast from the third day of the event with live audience participation both locally and online. The founders of Tolkienmoot are also the founders of an official smial of the U.K. Tolkien Society, known as the E√§ Tolkien Society based in Spokane, WA, USA. The E√§ Tolkien Society Smial Website Role Playing Game Systems Tolkienmoot has always been intended to support multiple game systems set in Middle-earth (and beyond). There are several other role playing gaming systems that have been under independent unofficial development and/or release for several years now, including: * Ambarquenta * Hitherlands * E√§ d20 * E√§ RPGS There are many projects that have adapted existing game systems to better fit into Middle-earth ranging from the early years of Dungeons & Dragons, GURPS, and Runequest, to other systems that many claim are already meant indirectly for Middle-earth gaming, such as Harnmaster. Luke Crane's Burning Wheel system is reputedly also fitting for role playing in Middle Earth. The system includes rules for playing non-humanoid creatures that were nonetheless given an (often maligned) intellect within the professor's universe such as Wolves and Great Spiders. Tolkienmoot supports many role-playing game systems due to multiple game masters and a greater variety of participants' gaming background interests. A lot of the renewed interest may be due to the earlier releases of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, causing a revival of interest in role playing in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, and the current releases of PJ's The Hobbit movies. Game systems now supported include: * Adventures in Middle-earth (AiMe) - Official licensed Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition role-playing game in Middle-earth, combining The One Ring RPG with the d20 5e system. * Cubicle7's TOR RPG - The One Ring Roleplaying Game released 2011. * E√§ d20 - E√§ d20 Website (adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 and AD&D; 1st Editions to Middle-earth). * Iron Crown Enterprises's Middle-earth Role-playing - MERP - 2nd Edition. * Decipher, Inc..'s The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game. * Iron Crown Enterprises's Rolemaster (adapted to Middle- earth). * Iron Crown Enterprises's HARP (adapted to Middle-earth). * Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons d20 Version 3.5 (adaptation known as \\"E√§ d20\\"). * Runequest the newly released revival of this system (adapted to Middle-earth). * Basic Role Playing system adapted to Middle-earth. * GURPS adapted to Middle-earth. * Harnmaster tweaked for Middle-earth. * E√§ RPG Basic Rules (no in beta game testing, and used at the event). * E√§ RPG Standard Rules (now in alpha game testing, and soon to be used at the event). * Savage Worlds RPG adapted to Middle-earth. Related Events So far Tolkienmoot is the only regular convention dedicated primarily or exclusively to role-playing gaming in J.R.R. Tolkien's world. There are a few other gaming conventions past, present, and planned in the near future that sometimes host a role- playing gaming session with a campaign set in Middle-earth in their events, usually just a room or small area. The other conventions that have some Tolkien related gaming may sometimes include: * DundraCon. Annual. San Ramon, CA, US * Gaming in Middle-earth convention.

Their evolution, culture and history coincide with the history of Oceania itself.

Women Learn the Political Ropes, Rights-East Timor The role of Kiribati women is described in the publication Kiribati, A Situation Analysis of Children, Women and Youth (2005) as \\"largely defined by her age and marital status\\". Prestige is inherent to the married Kiribati woman, but she is considerably under the authority of her husband. Historically, there was a strong \\"gendered division of labor\\" between women and men of Palau.

Women participate in the traditional music of Tuvalu which consists of a number of dances, including the fatele and the fakanau.  Promoting equality for women in Oceania  One of the organizations that promote empowerment and foster gender equality for the women of East Timor is the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). At present, the women of Indonesia are also venturing actively into the realm of national development, and working as active members of organizations that focus and act on women's issues and concerns. The women of New Zealand have the same level of equality with men, and are conferred the same level of respect as well.New Zealand Customs & Culture In relation to the labor force, based on data in 2006, Vanuatuan female workers comprised 49.6% of the workforce of Vanuatu. At present, women in Guam - together with Guamanian men - participate in jobs that belong to the wage economy category; but there are also women - among men - who work in the agricultural sector. In March 2011, International Women's Day was celebrated on Christmas Island for the honor of its female residents. The event was held in order to convey the theme of \\"what it means to be a woman living on Christmas Island\\".Christmas Island Celebrations - 100 women of Christmas Island for 100 years of International Women's Day, unifem.org Niuean women have \\"some rights\\" in relation to land tenure and inheritance of real property, but such rights are not \\"as strong\\" as those that belong to the men of Niue. = Education = Modern-day Fijian women have attained better access to education in recent years.

Research subject The Network provides all those who are interested in the history of the apostolic communities, like the Catholic Apostolic Church, the New Apostolic Church, Old Apostolic Church or the United Apostolic Church, a platform for exchanging information and materials. Annual meetings and seminars are held in Germany or other parts of Europe. The Network operates on an interdenominational basis, with participants in the Network belonging to different denominations. Meetings and participation in the network are open to everyone. The Archive Brockhagen (in Brockhagen, Germany) has been available since July, 2012. History = Founding = In 2008, twelve researchers and interested persons met for the first time in Coswig (Anhalt), discussing various topics covering apostolic church history. The aim of the meeting was to present talks and exchange materials, as well as get to know each other. The group created a website and a closed mailing list. On Sunday, 5 September 2010, in a three- hour meeting in Bielefeld, 14 founding members of the club established the association, the name of the network should carry Apostolic history eV. As a board of this association Mathias Eberle (Bielefeld, first chairman), were elected Sebastian M√ºller-Bahr (Kabelsketal, vice-chairman) and Volker Wissen (D√ºsseldorf, cashiers). In January 2011, creation, registration and recognition of charitable status had been completed. In the fall of 2012, the above-mentioned Board was re-elected unanimously. =Archive Brockhagen= The nonprofit organization operates since December 2011, the first research archive on the history of the Apostolic faith communities, the so-called Archiv Brockhagen. The freely available and independent archive is located in the former New Apostolic Church Brockhagen in Steinhagen in Bielefeld/Germany. Furthermore, regular public lectures and meetings are held at this location. Later, large collaborative projects like the idea of a shared archive were created. After calling for archival donations in the apostolic communities over 5,200 materials were gathered in the Archives Brockhagen. The organization also maintains the APWiki containing a history of apostolic communities. Since mid-2012, the initiative also operates the Online Archive of Apostolische-Dokumente.de available online, with more than 2,200 journals.

This lesson consisted of a few chords written on a piece of paper with an explanation of how to play them. Espe was educated at The University of North Dakota and Colorado State University where he studied English Literature. In 2004, Espe was introduced to touring by opening for the folk duo Storyhill in Minneapolis. Chris Cunningham (member of the duo) took Espe under his wing and invited him to open on his solo sets around Minnesota. After a self-released album in 2005, Espe continued to open for Storyhill. He toured solo across the U.S., including Western Alaska. He played in coffee shops, bars, churches, and a yoga studio once. Espe toured Northern Ireland opening for Juliet Turner and Brian Houston.

The SWD was also involved in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, under the command of Sabri Yirmibe≈üoƒülu. In 2010 Yirmibe≈üoƒülu told television news channel Habert√ºrk TV that Turkey burned a mosque during the Cypriot intercommunal violence in order to foster civil resistance against Greeks on the disputed island, and that their tactics included false flag acts, engaging in acts of sabotage made to look as if they were carried out by the enemy.Bloomberg, 24 September 2010, Turkey burned mosque during Cyprus conflict, general says See also * Counter-Guerrilla * Operation Gladio * List of Chiefs of the Special Forces of the Turkish Army * :Category:Special Warfare Department personnel References Category:Special forces of Turkey Category:Counter-terrorist organizations Category:False flag operations Category:Turkish invasion of Cyprus Category:1974 in Cyprus Category:Grey Wolves (organization) Category:Turkish nationalism Turkey Category:Riots and civil disorder in Turkey Category:Neo-fascist terrorism Category:1976 in Turkey Category:1977 in Turkey Category:1978 in Turkey Category:1979 in Turkey Category:1980 in Turkey Category:Conflicts in 1976 Category:Conflicts in 1977 Category:Conflicts in 1978 Category:Conflicts in 1979 Category:Conflicts in 1980 ","title":"Special Warfare Department"},{"id":"39758995","text":"Rafael Valek Moure (18 December 1932 ‚Äì 17 June 2013) was a Colombian footballer who played professionally in the Colombian Professional Football League, Serie A and Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n.

He was married three times and had 9 children. 6 live in Mexico, 2 live in Uruguay and 1 in Pasto. For unknown reasons and a supposedly jealousy incident by his wife in Mexico and some political comments he made, he was deported from Mexico and banned for life. He was never able to return and see his children which was the downfall of his professional career. He married a second time, under complex situations. After an argument with his second wife, on revenge, she had him deported again from Uruguay with no chance to see his two boys ever again. They grew estranged and separated. He missed his children to the last minute of his life and only reconciled with two of them from Mexico. His Uruguayan son remains uninterested to this day about his father's past.

Career Born in Barking, London, as a schoolboy, Restarick was on the books of London-based clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United before moving to Colchester United early in his apprenticeship in 1988. During his second year, he netted 17 goals in 15 games from October to December 1989, including four goals in one game on his 18th birthday. Towards the end of his apprenticeship, Restarick made his one and only Football League appearance, coming on as a substitute for Richard Wilkins during a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Peterborough United on 7 April 1990 as Colchester edged closer to relegation to the Conference. Despite Colchester's relegation, Restarick was signed on a professional contract, loaned to Bury Town during Autumn 1990, he featured in an experimental side in the Bob Lord Trophy against Fisher Athletic on 21 January 1991, scoring twice in extra-time, his first senior goals for the club, as the U's went on to record a 3‚Äì2 victory. Later in March 1991, he joined Fisher on loan alongside fellow youth-team product John Pollard, scoring once in 11 games. During Colchester's Conference and FA Trophy double-winning season, Restarick contributed goals in three different cup competitions but found first-team opportunities hard to come by, failing to register a league goal. He was loaned to local club Wivenhoe Town for a chunk of the 1991‚Äì92 season, finishing as Town's leading scorer with 11 goals in 17 games. As Colchester were promoted back to the Football League, Restarick was released, joining Chelmsford City where he scored 59 goals in 149 games for the club. This earnt him a five-figure fee move to Conference side Dover Athletic, where he could only muster four goals in 26 Conference games. He later played for Crawley Town, Dulwich Hamlet, Welling United, Gravesend & Northfleet and a second spell with Crawley. He then moved to Dartford, turning out on loan at Hastings United before a signing for Folkestone Invicta. He was made player-coach at Maidstone United and then made appearances for Chatham Town before returning to Maidstone as coach in 2006.

The lover of Andr√© Breton, she was addressed in Breton's love poems. Biography Suzanne Fernande Muzard was born on 26 September 1900 in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris, into a working-class family. At 18 she was a boarder in a training school, but left to work in the la Ruchette brothel, on the rue de l‚ÄôArcade. Whilst working there she fell in love with a young nobleman, but his family forbade him developing a serious relationship with her. After this disappointment she moved to Lyon, where she had friends. Her friends introduced her to a new protector. In about 1924 she returned to the la Ruchette. After meeting her during a visit to the brothel, The writer Emmanuel Berl falls in love with Muzard and in 1926 he sets her up in an apartment. At the beginning of November 1927, at the Caf√© Cyrano, the rendezvous of the surrealists, Berl introduces Muzard to Andre Breton. It was love at first sight. Breton and Muzard decide to leave Paris and spend a fortnight in the south of France, although she does not want to separate from Berl. Back in Paris in mid-December, Breton adds a third part to his novel Nadja, celebrating his new love affair with Muzard. Muzard pressurised Breton to divorce his wife, Simone, which he did. However Muzard ended their affair and married Berl. This caused resentment from Breton and the Surrealists. The marriage was tempestuous one. Breton wrote a surrealist poem about Muzard in 1931, L'Union libre (The Free Union). In 1934 she had an affair with Frederic Megret whilst in New Caledonia. On 26 October 1936 Muzard and Berl divorced. After the divorce, Muzard moved to Tahiti, where she met photographer Jacques Cordonnier. Muzard and Cordonnier married in 1940 and stayed together until Cordonnier died in 1961. Muzard wrote, under her married name of Cordonnier, an autobiographical essay entitled La passag√®re insoumise (The Rebellious Wanderer) in 1974. Muzard died in 1992. Her unfinished memoirs were published in 2004 by Georges Sebbag in Andr√© Breton, l'amour-folie: Suzanne, Nadja, Lise, Simone, a book on surrealist women.

In 2012 Grisafe released Atlantis, a full-length studio album featuring eleven upbeat pop tracks that do well to showcase her powerhouse voice. The album received six Grammy pre-nominations and has a few Grammy Award-winning collaborators associated with it, such as blues artist Sugar Blue (Rolling Stones) and producer Ricciano Lumpkins (TLC, P.O.D., Mya). Sami also won the Chicago Music Award for Best Rock Entertainer 2012.

She was named the Tournament MVP at the 2013 IFAF Women's World Games in Vantaa, Finland. Grisafe also sang the National Anthem prior to the Gold Medal game in Finland. A video of the performance went viral. Buzzfeed called her performance, \\"The most inspiring combination of sports and music you will ever see.\\" Grisafe received the Dare2BDifferent award by the Action Icon Awards in Los Angeles, CA in Fall 2015. She was given the award for her achievements in football and music. Early life Grisafe was born on March 26, 1985 in Loma Linda, California to Gregory and Kimberly Grisafe, who performed country music across the Southern California region. She has a younger brother, Kyle Grisafe. Grisafe's song \\"Two of Hearts\\" is an autobiographical account of her and her brother's childhood accompanying their parents to their shows. Although music was prevalent in Grisafe's life from a young age, most of her focus and achievements were in sports. She began playing baseball at age 5 and later became the first girl in her hometown, Redlands, CA, to make a boy's all-star team. In 1995 Grisafe began playing youth football. She threw 12 for 15 passes in the first football game she ever played. Grisafe also received accolades in theatre.

Musical career Music was a part of Sami's life from an early age. She went to gigs with her parents across Southern California. She received her first guitar when she was 10. Grisafe began writing songs when she was 18. When she went to college she was roomed with her future best friend, Linsea Moon Waugh, with whom she began performing and co-writing songs. Grisafe and Waugh performed throughout Chicago at coffee shops. Upon graduation from college, Grisafe's football schedule prevented her from auditioning for plays. She turned her attention to music. Grisafe landed her first gig/residency at Lonie Walker's Underground Wonder Bar, after an impromptu audition on a stoop next to the club. The venue owner, Lonie Walker, overheard Grisafe playing an original song and asked her to sit in. This venue would later provide a residency for Waugh and Grisafe. In 2010, after returning from the International Federation of American Football's first Women's World Tackle Football Tournament in Stockholm, Sweden, Grisafe was commissioned by the Women's Football Alliance to write and record a song for the league. Grisafe composed \\"4th and Inches\\" inspired by her experience in Sweden. Grisafe contacted a college drummer friend, Evan Ryan, to help her put together a band for the recording of the album. Ryan called on Matt Hines and Andy Neel. After two rehearsals, The Wick was on a flight to Dallas to record a full-length album comprising \\"4th and Inches\\" and 13 other songs written by Grisafe and arranged by Ryan, Hines, and Neel, entitled The Wick on Wax. However, the league deal fell through because of a change in ownership and the album lost its support. The Wick performed in Chicago for a year before breaking up in late 2011. Grisafe continued to play in venues all over Chicago, including: Metro, Double Door, City Winery Chicago, and Cubby Bear in Wrigleyville. In 2011, Grisafe had another undercover audition while bartending at The Closet in Lakeview. She played music in between making drinks for her regular crowd. In 2011, Grisafe met Kathy Kuras who contacted Grisafe about a project that \\"doesn‚Äôt pay much but would be a great creative experience.\\" The project was called I Hate Tommy Finch, a live play filmed and released as a web-series. Kuras also brought in her cousin, former Universal recording artists and Los Angeles based songwriter, Shannon Nicole, a former Universal Recording artist, and Jaclyn Rada, a local Chicago pianist. Grisafe wrote the title track of the soundtrack, ATLANTIS, inspired by the script for I Hate Tommy Finch. ATLANTIS was produced in Chicago by Grammy Award Winning Producer, Ricco Lumpkins, Kuras, and Grisafe. The album was a three-artist collaboration with Grisafe, Shannon Nicole, and Jaclyn Rada. It also included a featured performance by reggae rapper, Viper and former Rolling Stone's harmonica player and Grammy Award Winner, Sugar Blue. The album was released on Vicious Muse Records, founded by Kuras and Grisafe. ATLANTIS received 6 Grammy Pre-Nominations, 5 of which were for songs written by Grisafe. Including her autobiographical song featuring Sugar Blue, \\"Two of Hearts\\". A song about her and her brother's childhood with performing parents. From 2012-2014 Kuras and Grisafe continued to work together booking small tours through the Midwest, East Coast, and West Coast. Some notable venues include: Whisky A-Go-Go in Los Angeles, Chicago Pride, and during SXSW at a few unofficial showcases. Grisafe received the Chicago Music Award for Best Rock Entertainer in early 2013. In 2014 Kuras and Grisafe began working on the next project, Brand New Fairy Tale.

A video of her performance later went viral. The Huffington Post called her performance, \\"one of the most stunning versions of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" we‚Äôve ever heard.\\" A photo of her performance was featured in several publications including ESPN W. Laura Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, made a deal with Grisafe: if the Chicago Force won the National Championship in 2013, Ricketts would honor the team during a Cubs game at Wrigley and give Grisafe the opportunity of singing the National Anthem before the game. Ricketts kept her promise. Grisafe performed the National Anthem and Chicago Force were honored at Wrigley Field on September 3, 2013.

It was preceded by the single \\"Show das Poderosas,\\" which was the biggest hit song in Brazil in 2013. The album sold over 40,000 copies in the first 10 days after its release. The self- titled album had four singles and earned Anitta a Pr√™mio Extra, two wins at the Brazilian Music Multishow Award in 2013 and a Latin Grammy Award nomination. To promote the album, she performed on the Rede Globo programs Esquenta!, Caldeir√£o do Huck, Encontro com F√°tima Bernardes, Altas Horas, and Mais Voc√™. On April 6, 2013, Anitta performed on RecordTV's program Legend√°rios, and continued to make promotional television appearances throughout the spring. \\"T√° na Mira\\" was released as the third single on April 23, 2013. The previous single, \\"Show das Poderosas,\\" was released shortly before \\"T√° na Mira.\\" In the same month, the music video reached 1 million views in one week on YouTube. On June 21, 2013, Anitta reported on her Facebook page that the album was available for pre-sale at her online store, and its cover was revealed on July 2, 2013. Production and recording After having caught the attention of DJ Renato Azevedo (known as Batutinha) by recording a cover of Priscila Nocetti's song \\"Soltinha\\" and posting it on her YouTube channel, Anitta was invited by Azevedo to audition. He decided to work with her upon seeing her Stiletto dancing. Initially, Anitta started working for Hurricane 2000 but in June 2012, businesswoman Kamilla Fialho paid approximately $260,000 so she could manage Anitta. Fialho set up a show with musicians and dancers, invested in the image of Anitta, and presented the album to producers Umberto Tavares and Manozinha. In February 2013, Anitta signed with Warner Music and released \\"Meiga e Abusada,\\" the album's first single that was, initially, projected for a September 2013 release. In February 2013, Anitta began composition work with the production team in the studio. According to Wagner Vianna, artistic director of Warner, \\"the guys went without sleep some nights. Anitta gave a lot of opinions, but it was not complicated.\\" During this period, Anitta alone wrote \\"Show das Poderosas\\" and \\"T√° na Mira,\\" and the record company decided to release the former as the album's second single. Due to the success of the song, the release of the album was pushed up to June 20, 2013. On the cover, Anitta appears on a \\"brown background, arms open and her name written with pink glitter in the image,\\" according to Caras magazine. Anitta told Caras magazine that the brown background represented the ups and downs she had been through, and the glitter on her name is the success she reached with her first album. Music and lyrics The album attempted to fill a \\"hole\\" left in the mainstream Brazilian pop market. people magazine wrote that the album incorporated \\"international influences with an eye on the throne\\" of Brazilian pop. The album features sterile beats and explores diverse musical genres such as pop, dance-pop, electropop, dubstep, R&B;, reggae and funk carioca. In general, the lyrics explore the power of womanhood and seduction, with feminist and sensual themes - similar to songs by Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Katy Perry and Kelly Key. Release and promotion After \\"Meiga e Abusada\\" was released earlier that year, the album was scheduled for release in September 2013. On April 16, Warner Music released the second single, due to the song's commercial performance ‚Äì peaking at number one on the Billboard Brasil Hot 100 Airplay. The label decided to move the release to July 6, 2013. The album went on pre-sale on iTunes on July 2 and, on the same day, reached number one in the online store. Simultaneously, Anitta had three songs on iTunes' chart ‚Äì the single and acoustic versions of \\"Show das Poderosas\\" and \\"N√£o Para.\\" \\"Proposta\\" had been previously released as a promotional single on January 16, 2012, even though the singer didn't have a record deal and the song was subsequently included on the tracklist. \\"Menina M√°\\" was released as a promotional single on August 12, 2012, with the music video produced by Mais UP Produtora. Originally planned as the second single, \\"T√° na Mira\\" was eventually replaced by \\"Show das Poderosas\\" and the former ended up as promotional release on April 23, 2013. \\"Eu Sou Assim\\" was included in the soundtrack of the primetime telenovela Em Fam√≠lia. =Singles= \\"Meiga e Abusada\\" was first released on July 6, 2012, as a digital download. The video of the song, which includes co-stars Mayra Cardi (a former star of Big Brother Brasil), was released on YouTube on December 18, 2012, but the song had a single release almost two months later. Cardi appears dressed as a sexy maid, serving dinner to the \\"boss\\" and his family. Sonically, the track echoes the style of artists like Katy Perry and was recorded in a studio in Botafogo, south of Rio de Janeiro. The music video was directed by Blake Farber, who also directed Beyonc√© videos. The first part of the video was filmed in Las Vegas and in New York City, and Anitta is seen gambling in a casino. \\"Show das Poderosas\\" was released on April 16, 2013 and became Anitta's breakthrough hit. The song has reached over 130 million views and has sold over 50,000 digital copies only in Brazil. The lyric video was released on July 5, 2013. The music video had already been recorded months before the release of the track as a single. Anitta holds total songwriting credits. \\"N√£o Para\\" was released on July 2, 2013 as the third single, and replaced \\"Show das Poderosas\\" in the iTunes top spot. It debuted at #6 on the Brazilian Digital Songs chart with 690 units sold. The official video for the song was released on the TV program Fant√°stico on July 7, 2013. \\"Zen\\" was released on November 4, 2013. In 2014, it was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Brazilian Song. =Promotional singles= \\"Proposta\\" was released on January 16, 2012. \\"Menina M√°\\" was released on February 16, 2012 as a b-side for \\"Show das Poderosas.\\" \\"T√° na Mira\\" was released on April 23, 2013. An EP with the same title, containing songs like \\"Meiga e Abusada\\" plus exclusive songs, was released seven days later. Critical reception Anitta was received with mixed criticism from music critics. John Pereira from Audiogram said the album is a cliche pop album but that's not a bad thing. Yuri de Castro from Fita Bruta compared Anitta to Kelly Key and Preta Gil. Braulio Lorentz from G1 site said that in her first album, Anitta tries to \\"show that goes beyond the turn that made her to be contracted by a great record company, to inflate its cache and to beat several Brazilian singers\\". For Lorentz, the tracks of the project are \\"sticky and whistling,\\" and that Anitta wants to \\"embrace the pop of Beyonc√© (who is always called a fan), Katy Perry (reference declared for the video of \\"Meiga e Abusada\\") and singers Brazilians today more distant from the studios, like Kelly Key.\\" Guilherme Tintel for ItPOP, said the album is a compilation of samples of Beyonc√©'s songs and that the album abuses easy verses and features retention of funk beats. He added: \\"His vocal talent is very limited, now that he does one show after another he has lost many points in the\\" stage presence \\"category - almost always saved by the dancers, besides the good old prerecorded base - and as we said previously, because of the rush to take advantage of his first great success all that the record company did was to launch an album full of similar songs, having good points here or there.\\" Mauro Ferreira, of the Notas Musicais site, said that Anitta loses its power in the album, in a project that sounds \\"repetitive and industrialized in excess.\\" Ferreira says the label \\"boasts\\" the number of sales, from a project that contains artificial pop tracks to explore the popularity of Anitta, obtained through its hit \\"Powerful Show.\\" For the critic, the singer has more \\"pose than voice (small and opaque, say),\\" and calls her \\"Gretchen of the dances of the present time.\\" On the other hand, the website Que Del√≠cia N√©, Gente?, says that the first songs on the album are enough to \\"stick to your head, whether you like it or not.\\" But, that the project contains positive surprises like \\"Zen\\" and \\"Eu Sou Assim\\". However, the site closes the criticism saying that if \\"the intention of the record company was to average, he succeeded, but he scraped.\\" The site Verbloose says that Anitta has a \\"soft and gentle voice\\" that gives a personal touch to the songs. However, he warns that \\"there is still a long way to go\\" for Anitta to become a singer by name, because his album contains \\"silly, shallow and empty\\" lyrics, and says that his success is due to lack of competition in the Brazilian music market in relation to pop singers.

Early life Fedorovitch was born and raised in Minsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus) and studied painting in Krak√≥w, Moscow, and St Petersburg. She migrated from Russia to England in 1920. She was established as a painter until she met Ashton, after which she increasingly came to devote her career to set and costume design. Career Ashton and Fedorovitch met in 1925, introduced by Marie Rambert, who had met her in 1921. They worked together from A Tragedy of Fashion, Ashton's first ballet in 1926. Costumes and scenery were by Fedorovitch, who continued to work with Ashton for more than twenty years, and became, in his words, \\"not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser\\".Genn√©, Beth. \\"My Dearest Friend, My Greatest Collaborator ‚Äì Ashton, Fedorovitch and Symphonic Variations\\" , Ballet.co.uk, accessed 23 June 2013 As a friend and collaborator, she did most of her early works for Ashton. Altogether, they collaborated on eleven works. In 1940, Fedorovitch did stage design and \\"simple but gorgeous costumes\\" for choreographer Andr√©e Howard's best known work La f√™te √©trange, for London Ballet, based on an episode in Alain Fournier's novel Le Grand Meaulnes. It has been performed over 200 times by The Royal Ballet, and by Scottish Ballet. Her confidants, in addition to Ashton, included Barbara Ker-Seymer, Olivia Wyndham, Marty Mann and Lucy Norton. In her 2012 article in Research in Dance Education, Elizabeth McLean's view was that Fedorovitch had a \\"formative influence\\" on British ballet design of the 1930s and 1940s, and that she should be considered the equal of her contemporary, Christian B√©rard. Fedorovitch designed for several other British choreographers including Ninette de Valois and Antony Tudor, as well as for opera and theatre. From 1951 until her death in 1953, she was a member of the artistic advisory panel of Sadler's Wells Ballet, a role she had unofficially undertaken for many years. Death Fedorovitch died as a result of a gas leak at her house at 22 Bury Walk, Chelsea. The house, known as the \\"Gothic Box\\", was left to Simon Fleet, later mentor to fellow interior designer Nicky Haslam. A memorial plaque to \\"Sophie Fedorovitch, costume designer\\" was subsequently erected there. Ashton dedicated A Month in the Country to her memory.

He chose his surname Morpurgo from the Italian version of the German Marburger (i.e. someone from Marburg). From 1846 to 1849 Morpurgo attended and finished elementary school in Split. Later he attended the Royal grammar school in Split from which he graduated in 1856. Political and business career \\"Annuario Dalmatico\\" (Dalmatian Yearly) from 1859. published by Morpurgo. After completing his education, Morpurgo was employed at the library which was co-owned by his father and his business partner Petar Savo. There Morpurgo developed bookseller activity enabling him partnership with numerous foreign publishing houses. In 1855 he traveled to Trieste, Italy to sign contracts with booksellers and publishers. In 1860 Morpurgo founded his own bookstore \\"Libreria Morpurgo succ. Savo\\" by buying out Savo's shares. In 1861 he started the first interlibrary loan in Split. In 1862 bookstore was renamed to \\"Libreria Morpurgo\\". In 1859 Morpurgo published the Annuario Dalmatico (Dalmatian Yearly) and in 1861 he published the second volume which in contrast to the first volume discussed the political problems in the country. During 1861 out of ten political publications released in Split, five were published by Morpurgo. During that time he also published the variety of commemorative books and brochures. Morpurgo's bookstore, from the very beginning of its activity, was the headquarters of the People's Party, where young intellectuals, inspired by the ideas of the Hrvatski narodni preporod (Croatian national revival), held their meetings. Morpurgo was an informal organizer and adviser of the People's Party. Morpurgo was involved in starting the independent Croatian weekly newspaper Narodni list (People's paper). He took upon himself the administration and management of the newspaper, and also wrote the articles, mainly against the mayor Antonio Bajamonti Autonomist Party policies. Morpurgo was often targeted by the Autonomist Party supporters who repeatedly physically attacked him in the street (in July 1867, July 1868 and during the summer 1870). In 1870 Morpurgo was elected representative of the People's Party in the Diet of Dalmatia, assembly of the Kingdom of Dalmatia. In 1875, Morpurgo founded the first steam brick factory in Split. At home and abroad he was known for his alcoholic beverages company \\"Morpurgo\\", largest distillery in Dalmatia. In 1905 Morpurgo merged with Emil Stock to found the alcoholic beverages company \\"Morpurgo, Stock e Comp.\\" New company got the franchise to build the new liquor factory near Split (today part of Split). Factory concession was challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljeviƒá due to environmental issues. Some attributed this problem to the political conflict (Mihaljeviƒá was member of the Party of Rights) between Morpurgo and municipal authorities. Due to the disappointment of failing to get the concession, Morpurgo and Stock built the factory in Rovinj, Croatia. Morpurgo was also the elected vice president of the \\"Split Trade Chamber\\" and later its president. In 1870 Morpurgo co-founded the Prva puƒçka dalmatinska banka (First people's Dalmatian bank) in order to help Dalmatian farmers regain material independence from the mostly autonomist (members of the Autonomist Party) landowners, small capitalists and usurers who were lending money to farmers and during elections forced them to vote for the Autonomist Party. The bank initially operated in the Morpurgo's bookstore, as he was the first vice-president and later a president.Vid Morpurgo bookstore in Split, 2012.

Today many historians agree that Morpurgo's political ideas were aimed at the awakening of Croatian national consciousness, improving the economy of Dalmatia, education and cultural upliftment of its citizens. As a trader, bookseller, banker, publisher and columnist, Morpurgo dedicated his life to the People's Party goals.

She became the nation's first African American TV weather reporter for WXYZ-TV in Detroit, MI in 1963. In 1965, she became the first African American TV news reporter for KYW-TV (now CBS-3), in Philadelphia, where she continued until her retirement in 1999. Haynes, who received an Emmy Award as well as two Lifetime Achievement Awards during her 33-year tenure at KYW-TV, currently hosts an online show called the Trudy Haynes Show. Early life and education Haynes was born Gertrude Daniels in New York City on November 23, 1926. The only child of Marjorie and Percy Daniels, Haynes attended several schools but she graduated from Forest Hills High School in Queens, Long Island; racial segregation forced her to be bused to school. At Forrest Hills she became the only cheerleader of color on her high school team. In 1943 she was accepted to Howard University, where she studied sociology and psychology. Haynes earned her bachelor's degree in 1947.  Career  Prior to her work in news and network television, Haynes started with the Ophelia DeVore Charm and Modeling Agency in the early 1950s. DeVore was known for being one of the first to market products to ethnic consumers and use black models during the age of racial segregation and the civil rights movements. Stated in a 2004 interview with Contemporary Black Biography (CBB), \\"Modeling was just fun, I wouldn't say it was my career....It was just something to do on the side and because I was in New York at the time.\\" While associated with DeVore, Haynes appeared in several advertisements, most notably as the first African American to appear on poster advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes. Later she became an instructor for other trainees including Diahann Carroll and Beah Richards. = Broadcasting career = In 1956, Haynes took her first steps towards her true calling in broadcasting when she was hired by WCHB, a black- owned radio station in Inkster, Michigan. WCHB was the first black-owned radio station north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. The station was created and operated by the father of one of her college classmates. Haynes was initially hired as a receptionist; however, the director of the station took notice and asked if she wanted to be on a show. Accepting the position, Haynes was named WCHB \\"Women's Editor\\" and polished her interviewing skills while hosting a daily 90-minute program targeted to women. In 1963, seven years after making her broadcast debut, Haynes left the world of radio and entered the homes of many when she became the first African American weather reporter on ABC's WXYZ-TV in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Two years later, in 1965, Trudy Haynes continued to break milestones as she was hired as the first African American news reporter for KYW-TV (now CBS 3) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she worked until her retirement in 1999. When asked about her motivation in landing such a position, Haynes stated that \\"because of the lack of black reporters in the industry, I was never influenced by anyone. My growth was simply brashness on my part.\\" Haynes tells how she mustered up the courage to attain the position. \\"I overheard a conversation that a station was looking for a replacement for one of the ladies that was going to leave. She was blonde and blue-eyed. I called John Final, who had vision, and told him I was interested. He told me to come out. Actually, the brash one was him, to have the nerve to even interview a black person. That's the way it went.\\" In regards to the challenges she faced, particularly being a black and female seeking an on-air opportunity, when the industry was primarily dominated by white males, Haynes states, \\"Color is so obvious in this country‚Ä¶. Every black feels it. Every black person feels that. And every female that's breaking into (an all-male) situation probably feels the same way.\\" In the 1970s, Trudy Haynes became the first African American judge for the Miss America Contest, where she continued to break down color barriers firstly as a judge, and secondly, by challenging the narrow standards of beauty that restricted the participation of African American women in the contest. Her challenges opened doors for once barred women of color to become contestants and participate in this competition that had been formerly known as \\"white only\\". She continued in the capacity as a judge for the Miss America Contest for three years. = Current Projects = Haynes has stayed active in the media world following her retirement from KYW-TV. Based in Philadelphia, Haynes continues to freelance, and make guest star appearances on several local television shows, including WPHL-TV's Philly Connection, PAX-TV's The Good News, and Comcast Cable's Let's Talk About It and Trudy Haynes Discovers Delaware. Haynes established a production company, First Run Film/Video, where she generates her own show segments. She also became an active member of the Philadelphia Community Access Coalition, now known as Philly Cam, a lobbying group whose mission is to create public-access cable channels in the Philadelphia area. In 2012 Haynes produced and developed a local television show whose audience included the Philadelphia Tri-State area briefly on Comcast's Bounce, the first national African-owned television network, based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2013 Haynes in collaboration with LifeandSpritOnline.com, a Nazca Network affiliate, moved her popular show from television to an on-line On-Demand format, where \\"The Trudy Haynes Show\\" continues to inform its audience on current issues affecting the African American community, like health, education, and political issues. The show also features the local community and community events. In 2015 Haynes became co-host of Good Day, Good Health! a program created by Edward Grobes of Nazca Network to inform the masses about medical breakthroughs and ways to live a healthier life. It's interactive format, ranging from broadcast television to online on-demand videos, engages viewers to become a part of the program through social media.  Interviews  While on KYW-TV, Haynes' many stories were local based, she reported on local politics, City Hall and School Board meetings. As time went by Haynes interviewed a wide range of people from Philadelphia mayors and Pennsylvania governors to noted individuals such as Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., former President Lyndon Johnson, former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey, and former Teamster Union leader Jimmy Hoffa. Later, she began to interview show business personalities. Her connections with the entertainment world led KYW-TV to create a segment titled \\"Trudy's Grapevine\\" where she reported celebrity gossip. Additionally, she hosted such local public affairs shows as \\"Sunny Side Up\\" and \\"Sunday magazine\\".  Awards and Associations and Charities  Haynes has affiliation with many professional associations, which includes the Philadelphia Branch of the National Association of Black Journalists, lifetime member of the NAACP, National Alliance of Businesspersons, National Negro Business League, National Urban League Guild, and United Negro College Fund, where she established fund raising efforts for five years during her tenure at KYW-TV. In 1990, she went on to create a scholarship fund to be presented to distinguished Philadelphia-area students, where she established fundraising efforts for five years during her tenure at KYW-TV. In 1995, Haynes was awarded an Emmy in her field. Four years later, she was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame. But her most significant accomplishment, she explained, is that she \\"managed to cross a line in this field.\\" Haynes states, \\"I've been very well accepted, I think generally, by all races....Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods, and in any of these neighborhoods I go into, I'm welcomed.

The title was in an open beta phase from August 2011 to July 2012. A retail version was released in November 2011.PC Games Hardware, 9 October 2011: Drakensang Online: Auch als Box erh√§ltlich Drakensang Online takes place in the world of Duria where players assume the role of a character (Dragonknight, Ranger, Spellweaver or Steam Mechanicus) and discover cities, dungeons and wilderness areas in the 11 different regions in Duria. Drakensang Online was awarded the German Developer Prize as best German role-playing game and the \\"best browser game\\" award at the German Video Game Awards. Gameplay Drakensang Online is very similar to the Diablo game franchise and to other comparable titlesPeter Steinlechner auf Golem.de: Drakensang Online - Wie Diablo 3 - aber im Browser, 8 August 2011 in the way that is played from an isometric perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player creates a character by choosing to play as one of the four different character classes (Dragonknight, Ranger, Spellweaver and Steam Mechanicus) each of which has a different set of attributes. It is possible to create a maximum of up to four characters per account and server. The player can play solo or together with other players. There is also a guild system where players can organize themselves into alliances. Communication takes place via an internal chat system. The Drakensang world known as Duria is a freely explorable open world similar to medieval Europe. Duria has eleven regions with multiple cities, dungeons and wilderness areas. For faster progression, a player can use the in game virtual currency called Andermant to purchase weapons, upgrade items, teleport to other locations and more. There are a few ways to get Andermant. You can find it in the game by completing missions/quests, slaying monsters or opening chests. It can be bought with real money (free-to-play principle), similar to other free online and browser games, in an item shop by clicking on the in game Purchase button. And it can also be earned by participating in surveys or deals offered by the game's sponsors. History The roots of the project sprouted in 2008 when German developer studio Radon Labs released the title Drakensang: The Dark Eye and then in 2010, its successor Drakensang: The River of Time. They were classical single player role-playing games that both took place in the virtual game world of The Dark Eye (Das Schwarze Auge, DSA). In May 2010, Radon Labs filed for bankruptcy. It was then acquired by Bigpoint Games and was fully integrated in the existing studio of Bigpoint Berlin. In September 2010, the development of Drakensang Online was announced. Because Bigpoint did not acquire a TDE (DSA) license and only had ownership of the name rights for \\"Drakensang\\", they developed a completely new game world with an independent rule system which had no relationship to any of its predecessors. Like all other Radon Labs titles, the game is based on the custom Nebula Engine, which was meant for use in a browser. The game is written in C++ and runs within a Java applet in the browser. Since Java is no longer supported by some browsers, a downloadable client was made available in April 2015. In August 2011, Drakensang Online released an open beta version for testing which included the item shop for purchasing Andermant. With the inclusion of the virtual currency, the game was able to start its business operations. Although it is a browser-based game, two retail versions were released which included some items, that were otherwise available in the in-game store. The less expensive version included stronger armor as well as more combat power of the character and 10,000 Andermant, with which the player could use to buy other items via the in-game shop. The more expensive version included all the content of the other version plus a dragon that could be used as a pet, increased armor and combat power. According to the developer, the dragon gave the player a +20% bonus of experience points. Later, the contingent of included Andermant got increased from 10,000 to 12,000 Andermant.PC Games Hardware News. \\"PC Games Hardware\\" News of the 7 November 2011, retrieved on 24 June 2013. Reception It received a positive reception by the German magazine GameStar for its high-quality graphics in comparison with other browser-based games. Overall, Drakensang Online was described as a \\"frame of action role-playing game\\". A month after its release, more than 850,000 accounts were created. It has frequently been cited as one of the best new browser MMOs upon release. In 2011, Drakensang Online was awarded the German Developer Prize as best German role-playing game.

Walter Gill. The book was published by Yn √áheshaght Gailckagh, the Manx Society, and is Gill's only collection. It is a significant contribution to the literature of the Isle of Man, as there are few other individual poetry collections from this period. At the time of the books' release, Gill was serving as a private in active service in World War I.'Roll of Honour' by Sophia Morrison in Mannin Vol VII, May 1916 The release was conceived of partly as an extension of Manx literature and culture, being, as it was, the only poetry collection released by the Manx Society other than William Cubbon's selection, A Manx Poetry Book. But it was also used as a fundraiser for the war effort, as was announced at its release:'Notices of Books' by P. W. Caine, Mannin Vol VII, May 1916 > \\"The book is issued with the object of earning money wherewith the Manx > Society may be enabled to send music, reading matter and comforts to Manx > soldiers and sailors on active service or in training, and to that purpose > the gross receipts from sales will be devoted.\\" The book contained 31 poems, seven of which had appeared in print before: ‚ÄòLament of the Mother Tongue‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Ould Times‚Äô in Mannin (Volumes I and V),Mannin edited by Sophia Morrison, Vol. I, May 1913 and Vol V. May 1915 and 'Friends', 'Vespers', 'A Fancy', 'To an Exile', 'Exile to Exile' and 'Lament of the Mother Tongue' in A Book of Manx Poetry edited by William Cubbon.A Book of Manx Poetry edited by William Cubbon, Douglas, The Manx Language Society, 1913 Two of the poems were based on others' work; 'Inscription for a Crucifix' is a translation of Victor Hugo, and 'Lament of the Mother Tongue' is a verse version of W. J. Cain's literal translation from the Manx of William Kennish's 'Dobberan √áhengey ny Mayrey' which was first published in 1840. The poems are predominantly pensive or melancholic in mood, with winter or night as recurring settings or themes for nearly half of the collection. Other key themes include nature and the landscape, home and exile, and a foreboding of mortality. In contrast to other poetry and writing from the Isle of Man at this time, Gill's collection is striking for its relative absence of overt nationalism or sentimentality. This was commented on questioningly in a review in Mannin, the journal of The Manx Society, upon the book's release in 1916: > \\"Mr Gill's verses are not ostensibly and ostentatiously 'Manxy.' He uses the > dialect sparingly, and a little unsurely, and he cannot produce the > sympathetic intimate personal sketches which have so endeared 'Cushag' to us > all.\\" Despite such controlled reviews of the book upon its release, it came to be considered by Mona Douglas, one of the leading figures of the Manx Cultural Revival, to be Gill's 'best and most original contribution to Manx Culture', even over his highly renowned Manx Scrapbooks.This is Ellan Vannin, Mona Douglas, 1965, Chapter 28 One example of the tone of Gill's poetry can be found in October, a poem thatillustrates his unsentimental use of nature in his work:: > October The logo of Louis G. Meyer, the publisher of the collection :The > skies are dark and swollen with rain, :Their floor sags heavily round > Barrule, :The sun's face fades to a silver stain, :Out of the West the wind > comes cool :And full of the scent of rain at hand; :Rain-laden and gusty it > sweeps the hills, :Already its onset shakes and spills :The first few drops > of the brim-filled cup; :The fern is red, the rivers are up ‚Äì :Winter > beleaguers again our land. The title poem of the collection, 'Juan-y-Pherick's Journey', is the story of a delusional homeless man who travels the Isle of Man begging and preaching. His name is the Manx version of 'John of Patrick'. P. W. Caine, in his review of the collection, said of this poem that it was \\"profoundly interesting, if not always convincing\\". A letter to Mannin by J. R. Moore of Ashburton, New Zealand, suggested that the poem might be based on two real-life characters, Chalse y Killey and Thom Delby.‚ÄòCorrespondences‚Äô in Mannin Vol VIII, November 1916 Quotes * Our finite hearts thirst for the infinite sea. (Exile to Exile) * Watchful lights of a distant coast / Opening and closing like the yellow eyes of lions. (Lights) * Our women doze uneasily, / Their dreams made bitter by the sea.

The Strike began on May 9, 1934 as the Longshoremen in all ports of the West Coast walked out. Sailors from other ports walked out days later in support of the Longshoremen. In mid-June Employers offered a tentative agreement. As the proposal was debated, Mayor Smith declared a \\"State of Emergency\\" on June 14 and forced the police to mobilize to open the ports, which led to a standoff with the protestors. June 16 all Union Locals, except Los Angeles rejected the tentative offer. After the tentative agreement was rejected by the Longshoremen, the tensions and violence started escalating. Mayor Smith vowed to intervene on June 20 and The Seattle Post Intelligencer headlined \\"POLICE WILL OPEN PORTS TODAY!\\". The city and county amassed 300 police, 200 special deputies and 60 State Troopers. Strikers were outraged by Mayor Smith's betrayal of a promise to remain neutral and reinstated the embargo on Alaska Cargo. On July 3 in San Francisco the violence escalated, sparking a riot. Two days later \\"Bloody Thursday\\" occurred when police started shooting tear gas at the strikers. Seven strikers died on the Coast that summer, including a Seattle longshoreman shot by guards in Everett. A Seattle \\"special deputy\\" also died during a clash with strikers near the Smith Tower.A Brief History of Civil Violence in Seattle Seattle Police armed themselves with Tommy Guns and gas grenades to defend Piers 90 and 91, while strikers lay down on train tracks to idle the docks. Mayor Charles Smith prodded Chief of Police George Howard to be more forceful, and Howard finally resigned rather than trigger a blood bath. The mayor took over and began arresting scores of suspected \\"Communists,\\" but not enough to secure his re-election that fall. The 1934 waterfront strike ended with a union victory and spurred passage of federal laws ensuring workers' right to organize and bargain collectively. Further reforms and the production demands of World War II helped to pacify labor- management relations in most industries.A Brief History of Civil Violence in Seattle Paragraph 8, 9 Due in part to his participation in the Labor Dispute, Mayor Smith Lost the election to Dore, by a large margin.

The Busch Series, however, did hold the Kroger 200 at Indianapolis Raceway Park in nearby Clermont, Indiana the same weekend. From 1995‚Äì2011, the Truck Series also held a race at IRP. =\\"Super Weekend\\"= On September 3, 2009, Grand-Am tested on the combined road course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway as a potential future venue. A total of nine cars, representing both the Daytona Prototype and GT classes, participated. Laps were run in a clockwise direction (like Formula 1 at this track, and unlike MotoGP). For most of the test, the southwest turn of the oval was used (as it had been with Formula 1). A brief period in the middle of the day (approximately 20 minutes) was spent turning laps that included the southwest MotoGP road course section. On July 6, 2011, at a press conference held at the start-finish line, officials with the speedway, NASCAR, and the Grand American Road Racing Association announced the new Super Weekend at the Brickyard taking place July 26‚Äì29, 2012. The NASCAR Nationwide Series moved from Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis to the Brickyard to run a Saturday race while both the Rolex Sports Car Series and the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge would now run races on Friday. Further, the Rolex race is the conclusion of the new North American Endurance Challenge, a triple crown event along with the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The 2012 race weekend was the first time in speedway history that races took place on the 2.5-mile oval and 2.534-mile Grand Prix road course during the same weekend. The move has been done to counter declining attendance during the Brickyard 400. Some Cup series regulars took part in the Rolex Sports Car Series races. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Lucas Oil Raceway was also discontinued. The move of the Nationwide Series race from Lucas Oil Raceway to the Brickyard came with much criticism. Lucas Oil Raceway sold out every race in the 28 years it held a Busch Series/Nationwide Series race while offering exciting short track racing on the track, while many fans consider racing at the Brickyard \\"boring.\\" The sports car endurance race was put on hiatus after 2014. Track and series officials noted very low attendance for the Friday afternoon event, and considered moving the sports cars to their own stand-alone event.

History Palmer House was built in 1752 by Sir John Palmer, three times Mayor of Great Torrington and husband of Mary Reynolds, the author of Devonshire Dialogue and eldest sister of the artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, both brought up at Plympton in South Devon, who painted the portraits of his Palmer nieces. The house remained in the ownership of the Palmer family until the 1890s. Visitors Many famous people visited and stayed at the house. Sir Joshua Reynolds, brother-in-law of the builder, was a regular visitor.Lee, Elizabeth. Mary Palmer. Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol.43. Dr. Samuel Johnson, a friend of Sir Joshua Reynolds, stayed at the house in 1762. Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson, who had relatives in the area, is also known to have visited Palmer House. Description The house is a three-storied building with the front facade made of red brick with Ionic pilasters. In the late 18th century a wing was added to the back of the house.

From 1974 to 2008, he was the fifth president of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, formerly known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, Louisiana. Background Authement was born near Chauvin in a rural section of Terrebonne Parish to Elias Lawrence Authement and the former Elphia Marie Duplantis; both parents were natives of Terrebonne Parish and born in 1904. In 1950, Authement received his bachelor's degree from UL Lafayette. He subsequently procured both a master's degree in 1952 and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1956 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Authement and his wife, the former Barbara Braud (born c. 1932), had two daughters, Kathleen A. Prouet, who died in 1999 of leukemia and Julie A. Johnson of Lafayette. He began his career in higher education on the LSU faculty in 1954. He was also a former faculty member at McNeese State University in Lake Charles and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Prior to his UL Lafayette presidency, Authement taught mathematics and was thereafter the academic vice-president of Southwestern Louisiana from 1966 until 1970. UL Lafayette presidency Under Authement, UL Lafayette launched a $130 million construction program, moved from open enrollment in the manner of a community college to selective admissions, and joined NCAA Division 1, the highest level of collegiate athletic competition. In 1990, he hired the lawyer and former state legislator Carl W. Bauer as the chief lobbyist, or \\"Coordinator of Governmental Relations,\\" for UL Lafayette, and the two worked together to expand the campus and modernize the institution. Bauer remained at UL Lafayette two years after Authement retired. Authement worked to develop Ph.D. programs in the fields of computer science, mathematics, English, and history. UL Lafayette became the state's second largest university in enrollment - surpassed only by LSU - and the first public university in Louisiana to obtain a Doctoral II ranking. In 1997, he initiated a drive to increase private endowments to $75 million, which made possible the establishment of 20 endowed chairs worth $1 million each, 217 endowed professorships, and many scholarships. There is also a \\"super chair\\" valued at $2 million. During the Authement years the Cajundome, the popular basketball complex which seats 12,800, was constructed along with Oliver Hall, a $10 million computer science building. Cajun Field, a.k.a, \\"The Swamp\\", home of the Ragin' Cajuns football was also built almost ten years into Authement's tenure. UL Lafayette developed University Research Park, the National Wetlands Research Center, and the Louisiana Immersive Technologies Enterprise, which promotes economic development through innovation in digital media . The Edith Garland Dupr√© library was fully renovated. Newer campus buildings include the Paul and Lulu Hilliard University Art Museum, Moody Hall (the B. I. Moody III College of Business Administration), Legacy Park student apartments, an indoor athletic training facility, and a 400-vehicle parking garage at the busy intersection of Girard Park Drive and St. Mary Boulevard. Legacy UL Lafayette under Authement became an economic force within Acadiana and gained national attention in the fields of computer science, environmental and biological research, and French studies. The Carnegie Foundation designated UL Lafayette as a \\"research university with high research activity\\", comparable to Baylor, Clemson, and Auburn universities. The Ray P. Authement Valedictorian Scholarship is available through UL. The Ray P. Authement College of Sciences at UL is named in his honor. UL Lafayette presents the Dr. Ray Authement Excellence in Teaching Award to a faculty member. In 2009, Authement was named the UL Lafayette president-emeritus; he still taught mathematics classes again at UL Lafayette after leaving the presidency of the institution. Louis J. Michot, the Lafayette businessman who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1960 to 1964, ran for governor of Louisiana in the 1963 Democratic primary election, and served as the state education superintendent from 1972 to 1976, described Authement, prior to retirement from ULL, accordingly: > In spite of all the things he must have put up with in 30-something years, > he's still there. ... In a political climate like Louisiana, he stayed head > of a public institution for one-third of a century. He must have been doing > something right. Raymond \\"Coach\\" Blanco, a former ULL dean of students and the husband of former Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said that Authement, who was in competition with presidents from other state institutions, such as F. Jay Taylor and Dan Reneau of Louisiana Tech University and Rene J. Bienvenu of Northwestern State University, for limited available funds, \\"never believed in going down and playing the [lobbying] game in Baton Rouge. He always thought that if you did what you're supposed to do and had the merit that you would get rewarded. And sometimes that worked, and sometimes it didn't ...\\" In reality though, Authement was like most college presidents a politician but not the kind who places his name on a ballot. He developed close ties to the local political elite, having met on occasion with the late Lafayette Mayor J. Rayburn Bertrand and Sheriff Carlo Listi. Authement also established a close friendship with the clothing merchants, the brothers Edward and Herbert Abdalla, all of these interactions even before he became ULL president. Former Governor Blanco said of Authement: > He had great academic vision. He knew how to drive areas of excellence. And > that takes a lot of fortitude. There's a lot of campus politics that goes > on. He had to convince that faculty, and they understood and went along with > his program that achieving areas of excellence would bring the university > out of being a little country school with limited vision and limited > education for its students and into the modern world. And they understood > that and supported it. That's very hard to do. There are many campuses that > have never been able to get that far down the road. In retirement, Authement and his wife resided in Lafayette. Death On April 5, 2020, Authement succumbed to an \\"extended illness\\" at the age of 91 in Lafayette. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the family will have a celebration of life at a later date.

Anna Maria Cederschi√∂ld (20 November 1815 in V√§xj√∂ - 7 January 1892 in Lund) was a Swedish noble deaconess and nurse. She was a pioneer in the education of deaconesses and nursing in Sweden, and the first head of the first Deaconess institution in Sweden, Ersta diakoni, in 1851-1862. Life She was the daughter of the vicar in Forsheda, Kasper Hakvin Cederschi√∂ld, and Helena Sofia Ingelman. She was engaged to her foster brother, but the engagement was broken by his death, an event which is thought to have caused her interest in religion and introduced her in religious circles. She was educated at home and managed a girls school in Lund in 1848-49, before she was promised the place as head of the future Deaconess Institution, which was at that point planned to be founded in Stockholm. In order to prepare herself, she studied the deaconess institution in Germany 1850-51, before she returned to take her place as head of the Ersta Diakoni in Stockholm, which was founded upon her return in 1851. This was the first formal education of nurses in Sweden: a secular nursing training was not to be opened until that of Emmy Rappe in 1867. In Germany, she studied at Kaiserswerth under Theodor Fliedner just as Florence Nightingale. She had been recommended this position by a friend from the religious circles in Lund, where she was well known. During her tenure as principal and deaconess, \\"Sister Maria\\" became known for her hard work, in particularly during the cholera in Stockholm in 1853. In 1854, she co-founded the Fruntimmers√§llskapet f√∂r f√•ngars f√∂rb√§ttring in Stockholm with philanthropist Mathilda Foy, writer Fredrika Bremer, writer Betty Ehrenborg and Emilia Elmblad, founder of the Stockholm home for reformed prostitutes.Elisabeth Christiansson: \\"F√∂rst och framf√∂r allt sj√§len\\" Diakonins tankev√§rld omkring √•r 1850.

She had been expected to return to her position after her health had been recovered, but she never did so. She moved to Osby with her mother and another deaconess, and in 1877 to V√§xj√∂. In 1889, she visited Norway to participate in the planning of the first deaconess institution in Oslo.

Biography  = Childhood and education = Zainul Arifin was born as the only child of a descendant of king of Barus, Sultan Raja Barus Tuangku Ramali bin Sultan Alam Sahi Pohan with a woman of Kotanopan noble origin, Mandailing, Siti Baiyah boru Nasution. Zainul was a toddler when his parents divorced and he was brought by her mother to Kotanopan, then to Kerinci, Jambi. There, he completed his education at Hollands Indische School (HIS), a type of elementary school for Dutch or aristocratic children in the Dutch East Indies. In addition, Zainul Arifin also deepened his religious knowledge in mosques and Madrasas while also undergoing the trad√¨tional martial arts training of Pencak Silat. After graduating from HIS, Zainul continued his education to Normaal School, a middle school for future teachers. Arifin was also very artistic and was once active in the Malay musical theater, Stambul Bangsawan or \\"Musical Theater of the aristocrats\\". On stage, Arifin took roles as a singer and violinist. Stambul Bangsawan itself is the beginning of the development of opera theater of modern Indonesian performing arts. At the age of 16, Zainul Arifin then migrated to Batavia (Jakarta). = From Gemeente to GP Ansor = In Batavia, Zainul used his HIS diploma to apply for work at the colonial township government (Gemeente) as a clerk in the Water Company (PAM) in Pejompongan, Central Jakarta. There he worked for five years before finally being laid off when the Great Depression in the U.S. impacted the Dutch East Indies in the 1930s. After quitting the gemeente, Arifin then chose to work as an elementary school teacher and as educator for adults Sekolah Pendidikan Rakyat, in the Meester Cornelis Region (Now Jatinegara). Zainul also often provided legal assistance to people who needed a lawyer with no educational background yet mastered the Dutch Law (Pokrol Bambu). In addition, he was also active again in the musical theater arts activities of traditional Betawi musical theater much influenced by the Malay tradition of Stambul Bangsawan called Samrah. He also founded a group called Samrah Tonil Zainul. Through this artistic activity, Arifin met and befriended Djamaluddin Malik, who would later turned into becoming a very prominent filmmaker in Indonesia. They both were very active in Samrah activities and later joined the Youth Movement (GP) ANSOR when it started actively recruiting new young members. Ansor was a youth movement under the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). As a member of ANSOR, Arifin underwent ANSOR religious trainings preparing youths to become future Islamic preachers. Zainul's expertise in delivering speech, debating and preaching in Dutch and English had caught the attention of leaders of the Nahdlatul Ulama, including Wahid Hasyim, Mahfouz Siddiq, Muhammad Ilyas, and Abdullah Ubaid. In just a few short years, Zainul had become chairman of the Jatinegara Chapter of NU. Later, he was appointed as the Head of NU Consul in Batavia, until the arrival of the Japanese army in 1942 during its invasion of the Dutch East Indies. = Becoming the commander of Masyumi's Hezbollah = During the era of Japanese military occupation, Zainul Arifin became a representative of the NU in the management of the Indonesian Muslim Shura Assembly (Masyumi) and was involved in the creation of the paramilitary group Hezbollah. To gain the sympathy of the locals, the Japanese gave Islamic organizations (mainly NU) an opportunity to be more active in government under Japanese military occupation. Zainul Arifin was tasked with the creation of the Tonarigumi, a precursor to the current Rukun Tetangga, in Jatinegara, and eventually in other villages situated on the island of Java. With tensions rising during the Asia-Pacific War, Japan permitted the creation of various local paramilitary organizations. Young Muslim men were recruited to such organizations, including what would eventually become Hezbollah. Arifin, who was appointed Hezbollah's commander, was tasked with coordinating semi-military training in Cibarusa, situated near Bogor. During the height of those trainings in anticipation of a potential battle, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed Indonesia's independence on 17 August 1945 in Jakarta. = Post-Independence = Zainul was then charged with representing the Masyumi Party's faction within the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP), the precursor to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), while continuing to hold the leadership of Hezbollah, which had also been integrated into the armed forces. During the Indonesian National Revolution, in addition to attending sessions of the KNIP which had been relocated several times due to the urgency of the situation then, Arifin also led guerrilla movements in Central Java and East Java during the first and second Dutch Military Aggressions. During the Dutch's second military offensive in December 1948, the Dutch military had successfully captured Yogyakarta and held both Sukarno and Hatta captive. During the state of emergency, the Working Committee of the KNIP was essentially non- functioning. Arifin was then involved as a member of the Central Government Commissariat in Java, part of the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) located in Bukit Tinggi, West Sumatra. Zainul's main task was to consolidate the bodies waging guerrilla tactics under the command of General Sudirman. When the government merges all armed forces into the centralized Indonesian Armed Forces, Zainul Arifin was initially appointed secretary of the Armed Forces' top leadership. However, when many former members of the Hezbollah were not accepted as members of the military, citing that they weren't given modern education and only graduated of madrasas, he chose to resign and concentrate on the continuing struggle for civil political channels. = Legislative dan Executive Career = With the Netherlands finally recognizing Indonesia's sovereignty on 27 December 1949, Zainul Arifin returned to Parliament as a representative of the Masyumi Party and later representative of the NU party when it finally broke away from Masyumi in 1952. A year later, Arifin was then involved in the executive branch after being appointed Deputy Prime Minister under Ali Sastroamidjojo's second premiership (1953‚Äì1955).  Political career  Since Indonesia's independence Zainul Arifin has sat in the Working Committee of the Central Indonesian National Committee (BP KNIP), the predecessor to MPR. Arifin was active in parliament representing the party and later the NU party after breaking away from Masyumi in 1952. Only during 1953‚Äì1955 while serving as deputy prime minister under Ali Sastroamidjojo's second premiership was Zainul involved in the executive branch. This administration was successful in organizing the Bandung Asian-African Conference in 1955. The General Election in 1955 had ushered Zainul Arifin to become a member of the Constituent Assembly and deputy Speaker of the DPR until the two institutions were dissolved by presidential decree 5 July 1959. During the early days of the Guided Democracy era, he then chaired the House Mutual Aid (DPRGR) in an effort to strengthen the Communist Party of Indonesia (\\"PKI\\") in parliament. Amid political tensions, on 14 May 1962, during Eid al-Adha prayers at the forefront with Sukarno, Zainul was shot by a DI/TII separatist who intended to kill the president. Zainul Arifin eventually died on 2 March 1963 after sustaining the gunshot wound for ten months.

Women in the Americas are women who were born in, who live in, and are from the Americas, a regional area which encompasses the Caribbean region, Central America or Middle America, North America and South America. Their evolution, culture and history coincide with the history of the Americas, though often the experiences of women were different than those of male members of society. The differences in women's experiences often had to do with division of labor or constraints placed on them due to traditional roles in society. The effects of slavery, bondage and colonization has had a profound effect on women in the Americas over time. Society for the History of Women in the Americas (SHAW),Society for the History of Women in the Americas (SHAW) website is a British organization that studies women's history in context of their connection to the Americas. Studying women's history allows for the restoration of lost information about how women lived, worked and participated in their cultures. Looking at women's history through the lens of a shared geography and culture allows useful comparisons of women's lives in the Americas without nationalism clouding the narrative. History Full-length, front and back portraits of a native woman from Dasamonquepeio of the Americas showing manner of dress and way of carrying a child on her back; view of river and landscape in the background, (1590). = Prehistory = Women in the Americas or the women who now populate what is known as North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America arrived via migration. Many origin stories of the Native peoples who populated the Americas contain themes of the people arriving via another place, whether that is from the ground or from waters, and journeying to their point of origin. The first historical evidence of people in the Americas from scientific study comes from mitochondrial DNA of Paleoindians who crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Beringia into the area now known as Alaska around 13,000 years ago. From the north, migrants from Beringia traveled to the south and from there branched from the west coast toward the east. Initially both men and women were involved in hunting and gathering, as survival depended on all members of society working together. Gathering and storing food, making shelter and clothing to survive harsh northern climates, required multiple skills. Though it is impossible to determine exactly what the division of labor was for early people, it is clear that adaptations were made by migrants to adjust to changing situations. Early archaeology focused on the importance of big game hunting as a survival strategy for Paleoindians, but newer research indicates that a more reliable strategy was more likely centered on gathering activities of women and children. As tools were developed, specific tasks may have taken on gendered aspects, possibly based upon negotiated roles, age, or preferences. When farming emerged in the Archaic period (8000 to 3000 B.C.E.), and a shift from procuring food from available sources was made, societies were transformed toward more settled communities often developing social classes, trade and economic specialization of labor. Archaeological records indicate that women \\"played a strong role in this transition\\" throughout the Americas and the activities of women in the creation and use of stone tools is evidenced in the period. Burial records during the archaic period do not reveal much about status differences between women and men but confirm that they performed separate tasks. By the Formative stage, (sometimes called the Preclassic Era, which varies by region but typically spans from 3000 B.C.E. to 150 C.E.), women had become key figures in rituals and belief systems. Figurines from throughout the Americas, including the Caribbean region, depict women in postures of respect demonstrating power and prestige and participating in varied economic, political, religious and social activities. In the Classic stage and Post-Classic stage, the developmental eras between the Formative and Colonization, imagery on Mayan pottery reveals women were depicted as deities in ritual practices and that their primary roles revolved around cooking, food preparation and clothing manufacture. In South America, the Classic stage is used to describe the period of settled, urban dwelling similar in structure to those found in Mesoamerica. During the same time-frame, in North America, studies confirm that there was no uniform practice toward women or their place in society. In some matrilineal societies, women were assigned specific roles in the ceremonial, economic and political customs of their societies. In some patrilineal groups, women gained prestige from their relationships with men but were allowed to own their own property and were honored for their participation in crafts and ceremonial functions. In ambilineal societies, women were allowed to own property, be recognized in political roles, and act in both economic and ritual capacities. Most Native cultures did not have hierarchical power structures where influence or authority was held by only one gender. Women were active both creating society and in leadership roles in this period; however, that changed. As societies in the Americas developed, the commitment to maize growing expanded throughout the region. By the time of contact with Europeans, most North American women were farmers, and had accepted supporting roles to their men, who performed hunting, trade, and diplomatic functions. = European contact and colonization = Conquest by and contact with Europeans brought extreme changes to all of the inhabitants of the Americas. Disease and a lack of immunity to African and European diseases killed more than 80% of the Native population of the Americas within the first two centuries of the Colonial period. The main European groups which colonized and fought over control of the region included the Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. They established economic systems which benefited themselves, taking land and resources, as well as requiring labor from native peoples or importing slaves. Though bondage had existed among native cultures, captives or slaves were treated as pawns to be used in diplomatic relations, for resolving disputes, to right wrongs, or as punishment for crimes and often had multiple functions, as laborers, prisoners, or property. The majority of captives were women, as they could be used as negotiators and also to replenish declining populations of either their own culture or their captor's culture. Though the result of the conquest varied because both the native cultures and the various European groups differed, male-female relationships were significantly altered by contact. French, Portuguese and Spanish colonizers brought Catholic religious beliefs to Latin America and North America, which imposed the subordination of women to male authority and removed women from ceremonial rites. Dutch and English colonizers brought predominantly Protestant indoctrination to native peoples with its male-dominated views of both gender roles and sexuality. Exploitation of South America and the Caribbean preceded that of the North American continent. In the earliest period, individuals were put ashore to explore areas, learn the language and customs and prepare to be translators and guides for later expeditioners. These explorers were encouraged to intermarry with indigenous women to strengthen and legitimize claims of power and territory. Violent contact followed, wherein indigenous people resisted and were either subjugated or brought to extinction by adventurers seeking riches and glory. Church functionaries were brought with troops to serve as administrators to the crown and serve as social control agents. Spanish and Portuguese missionaries strongly opposed sexual behaviors, including adultery, polygamy, premarital sex, as well as nudity, which were tolerated by native populations. They sought to have women cover themselves, accept Christian marriage and become maternal, domestic caretakers and yet at the same time, the invading military forces sexually abused and seized women forcing them into concubinage. Equally, officially hostile to Two-Spirit sexual practices, Europeans used gender-variant native people to service their own needs. Violence was tolerated, and in some instances encouraged by priests, to tame women, keep them from sin, and to keep them obedient to their husbands. Iberian women did not arrive in the New World until battles had been won and towns and cities had been established. Thirty Spanish women were allowed to participate in Columbus' third voyage of 1498 if they were willing to become permanent inhabitants of the Spanish colony. The intent of allowing women passage was that they would marry and bring morality to the colonies, as well as being able to convince other high-born women of the wealth to be had by emigration. Spain's intent was to integrate the people they conquered into Spanish society and impose Iberian cultural and religious beliefs upon their new territories. Sometimes indigenous cultures would facilitate integration, such as the Inca in Peru who gave Incan women to the Spanish men as gifts and brides. The entry of Europeans into North America followed a similar pattern to early exploration period in South America. Individuals or small bands of soldiers were sent to areas along the Gulf and southeastern coast of America on expeditions of discovery. The soldiers demanded food, laborers to help them carry their goods, and women, who they used for cooking and sex. To the north, solitary French explorers and trappers moved into Canada and were followed by missionaries. No large-scale colonization effort was made, as native women were exploited to increase the population, but in the 1660s France did send about 850 young women (single or widowed) called King's Daughters (\\"filles du roi\\") to Canada. They quickly found husbands among the predominantly male settlers, as well as a new life for themselves. They came mostly from poor families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. A handful were ex-prostitutes, but only one is known to have practiced that trade in Canada. The Dutch and English colonization efforts were begun as a marriage between settlement and commerce. Dutch exploration began when the Dutch East India Company hired Henry Hudson in 1609 to discover a shipping route to Asia. Though the Northwest Passage was not discovered, involvement in the fur trade soon commenced and the colony of New Netherland was established. As the colony was a business venture, the directors weighed the profitability of expanding settlement against possible returns to be gleaned from the commercial possibilities and sold provisional orders for colonization to families. The policy ensured that women were part of the colonizing effort from conception and that the company valued the complementary roles that men and women would provide to growth of the colony. The first English settlers were not farmers, or familiar with the woodlands, but rather primarily townsfolk and city dwellers. A year after the founding of Jamestown, the first two women arrived at the settlement in 1608 and were followed the next year with approximately 120 more women, who were either wives and fianc√©es of previous settlers or where hired by the Virginia Company to help establish the colony. With the establishment of settlements, the Atlantic slave trade was introduced and in fact, until 1800, the majority of women who arrived in the Americas were not free migrants, but rather arrived as slaves. Estimates are that four-fifths of all women who came to the Americas before 1800 were not European women. = Bondage and women in the Americas = Daguerreotype of Delia, a slave woman on a plantation in Columbia, South Carolina. Delia was an American born slave, daughter of Congo born slave \\"Renty\\". (circa 1850-1853) Africans, Native Americans and Europeans all were part of the slave trade in early modern North America. Throughout the Americas, bondage existed‚Äîin warmer climates, where plantation systems developed, or in the northern areas, where women were either transported as criminals or worked as indentured servants. As early as the 1530s, Portugal began using slave labor in Brazil to work sugarcane plantations. Initially, the Portuguese used indigenous people as slaves, but in 1574, the crown decreed that unless the native people were cannibals, already slaves, or were spoils of a \\"just war\\", they could not be enslaved. The Spanish also used native people as forced labor, but because under the encomienda system, neither the estate nor the indios were an inheritable asset, it differed from slavery, which was abolished in Spanish colonies in 1542. When the Dutch took over Brazilian sugar concerns in the early seventeenth century, they not only continued importing Africans for slave labor, but became instrumental in spreading sugar production throughout the Caribbean. A Dutch-trained Englishman, John Drax, modified farming methods used in Brazil to fit a small island model in Barbados in the mid-1650s, establishing that the Caribbean islands could supply sufficient goods for Amsterdam's refineries. During the same time frame, both France and England began using slavery in the West Indies. By the 1620s the British began to expand into the Caribbean, taking former Spanish holdings. Initially the islands were planned to be settled by small farmers growing crops for export to England. Fairly quickly, as sugar was more profitable, small farmers were pushed out and plantation economies were developed. As indigenous labor on haciendas and ranches in the Spanish territories encompassed all of the indios within the confines of the estate, native women worked tending to children, the sick, and as cooks, but gendered tasks were often blurred and they worked in fields and tended to livestock as well. In areas in which the encomendero used his indios for mining, entire families participated. Church authorities in areas in which indigenous people and non-natives mingled, were prone to accuse natives of practicing witchcraft and Inquisitional auto-da-f√©s or torture were used to spur conversion to Catholicism. Women and children made up the majority of African slaves sent to the Americas, regardless of whether their labor was as northern domestics or southern field labor Slave women made up a large percentage of the workers on Caribbean sugarcane, indigo and coffee farms and were employed in all tasks not deemed as \\"skilled labor\\", including working as house servants, preparing fields for planting, planting indigo or coffee seeds, cutting cane and feeding the cuttings into the mill, or performing corv√©e labor. Women were also highly valued for their reproductive ability. African women who were enslaved and brought to the Americas were used to produce more slaves and were also exploited as sexual objects. In popular culture, they were depicted as monstrosities. Such depictions led Europeans to falsely assume that they could not feel pain, even in childbirth. After 1650, slavery in the Americas was increasingly tied to one's race, with women of color being defined as slaves who would have an indefinite period of service. Though initially indigenous people used female slaves as manual laborer, currency in diplomatic alliances and as sexual objects, as the plantation economy grew, tribes in the southeastern United States adapted the way they used slavery to fit the European model. Emulating and competing in the commerce systems of the white settlers, the Five Civilized Tribes not only used slave labor on their plantations in the South, but also transported the practice to the plains in the 1830s, when they were removed to Indian Territory, in present day, Oklahoma. alt=AntiSlavery Engraving from the American Anti-Slavery Almanac, 1840.thumb AntiSlavery Engraving from the American Anti-Slavery Almanac, 1840. Beginning in the late sixteenth century, Britain used its New World colonies as a place to transport criminals. Few systematic studies have been done on women who were transported; however, records on overall transports reveal that in the early period of the practice, many prisoners were political dissidents. They may have been shipped to Barbados, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands or to the continent. The practice increased after the passage of the Transportation Act 1717, and estimates are that somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 women were sent between 1718 and 1776 to the Americas. Transports' sentences could range from 7 years for committing petty crimes, usually thefts of under one shilling, to fourteen years for felonies to life for pardoned felons, who had been convicted of capital crimes. In popular culture, which early historians repeated as fact, many female transports were thought to be prostitutes. While there may have been commercial sex workers among transportees, since if charged with multiple crimes women were rarely tried for solicitation, there were no convictions for prostitution at Old Bailey during the period. As young women moved to English cities to find work, prosecutions of women surged, as authorities feared that women living alone would abandon their feminine natures and their families and take up unnatural behaviors, including cross-dressing and other immoral acts. Records from Old Bailey indicate that women made up the majority of prosecutions in London and that the majority of their convictions were from theft of household goods or clothing and typically items were stolen from an employer. The profile of women transportees was a young woman between 15 and 30 years old, who was employed in domestic work. Rarely did they steal at the direction of men, as was formerly assumed, but rather acted as independent agents or if their actions were group activities, the group was made up of other women. After waiting for months, or even years in a British prison, transportees were loaded onto convict ships and sent abroad, often becoming mistresses or unwilling sexual partners to sailors during the voyage. Their labor was sold to cover the cost of their passage. In most instances, convict laborers were treated equally to slaves, but fear of contracting venereal diseases may have led convict women to be less sexually exploited than their African counterparts. Because of the social stigma of being a criminal, many convicted women returned to England after their sentences expired. The practice ended on continental North America with the outbreak of the American Revolution and a failed attempt at transporting convicts in 1789 to Newfoundland. Indentured servitude was another form of bonded labor, in which the laborer could agree to work for a specified period in exchange for payment by the employer to the ship captain who had transported the worker. During the early part of the 17th century, women made up 1/6th of migrant contractors; by the 18th century their numbers surged to between 33% and 50% of indentures. Typical women indentured servants were unmarried, orphaned girls, between fifteen and twenty-four years old. They were unable to marry without the consent of their employers and many times could not leave or purchase goods without their employer's approval. Often, women's compensation was poor and they could be punished by whippings, fines, or even branding for laziness, theft or escape attempts. Unlike slaves, indentured servants' period of labor ended at termination of their contracts. They were also allowed to sue employers for mistreatment and were required to be provided with a minimum level of food and clothing. Most women indentured servants during the colonial period were domestic workers and after completing their contracts, many married, though having lost up to eight years in servitude, they tended to have fewer children than other women in the period. Indentures declined during the period when convict labor surged, as transported convicts were paid lower wages, but indentures, particularly among Asian workers increased in the Caribbean after the abolition of slavery. Part of the decline might also be attributed to the shift to a redemptioner system in which instead of selling their labor to a guaranteed employment before they embarked, ship captains agreed to transport laborers and be reimbursed after arrival, selling contracts to the highest bidder. Change to the redemptioner system meant that families could immigrate together and increased German and Scotch-Irish immigration. When slavery was abolished and new means of cheap labor were sought, crimping inducements soared in Chinese ports and officials were loath to allow females to emigrate. Similarly, Japanese influence in Korea, and the desire of the Japanese to keep Korean labor out of U.S. markets in Hawaii, spurred labor recruiters acting in Korea to contract with over 1000 Korean laborers‚Äî196 single men and 257 families‚Äîto work in the henequen industry in Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. Though some women were tricked into indenture agreements in the Caribbean, most voluntarily went because of poverty or social conditions. The numbers of Chinese women who migrated to Peru and Cuba remained relatively small, but some 250,000 Indian women agreed to indenture contracts, making up 40% of the Indian indentured laborers transported to the Caribbean. They encountered societal and family oppression, poverty, lack of power, sexual abuse and violence during their indenture, but most remained after their contracts were completed. Indentured labor in the Americas did not cease until well into the 20th century with India ending the practice in 1916, Britain prohibiting its debt contracts the following year, Mexico terminating its hacienda system in 1917 and agrarian reform and revolution which ended Peru's hacienda system in 1952 and Bolivia's in 1969. = Women and social movements in the Americas = Women in the United States were extremely active in the abolition movement. Women \\"were on the front lines, traveling the countryside--speaking on the issue of slavery\\" and were considered the \\"backbone\\" of the anti-slavery movement. Lucretia Mott and William Lloyd Garrison eventually founded the American Anti-Slavery Society and both were supportive of women being equal voices in the fight against slavery. Women such as Sarah McKim and Susanna Wright, were active in the Underground Railroad, helping slaves escape into freedom in the North. Involvement wasn't limited to white women, as black women and Native American women were also involved in helping slaves escape, speaking out about slavery, and protecting them. Christiana Carteaux Bannister helped shelter around one hundred slaves who came through Boston, and Harriet Tubman was well known for her involvement in the Underground Railroad, Sojourner Truth gave speeches about the ills of slavery, and women such as Cherokee Sally Johnson, tried to protect her husband who was an escaped slave by deeding him part of her land. The Tuscarora, Iroquois and Seminole were known to assist fugitives. For many women, the struggle for abolishing slavery brought about a desire to fight for their own rights. Recognition that they were unable to participate at the London Anti-Slavery Convention in a forum trying to promote rights for another group of people, led Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott to hold the Seneca Falls Convention for women's rights in 1848. In Latin America, the 19th century was a time of revolution with Nationalist movements and Independence Wars erupting throughout the Spanish colonies, many led by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Women were not simply spectators or support for men in the wars of Latin America, but took up arms, acted as spies and informants, organizers and nurses. In the Spanish Caribbean, though no armed rebellion took place, women collaborated with separatist groups and pressed for an end to slavery. Women's participation in the push for nationalism led the way to replacing the former trend for women to lead a life secluded from society to one of involvement and a push for more voice in social and political movements. In particular, women began organizing secondary schools for young women. Another press for societal improvement, the Temperance movement, shows a marked difference between the Americas. In the United States and Canada, women flocked to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). It was the largest non-denominational women's organization in Canada during the 19th century, as abuse of alcohol was widely credited as the cause of disease, immorality, poverty, prostitution, unemployment and violence. The WCTU also was the largest women's organization in the United States and seen as an organization that could help women gain protection for themselves and their children from the violence they experienced and achieve social reforms. Temperance did not receive such enthusiastic support in Latin America, though some countries, like Mexico, did attempt to curtail consumption. For many women who had been confined to their homes, producing and selling alcohol, had been a means of both economic support and a way to participate in business ventures in an environment where women were usually barred from participation. Pan-American women at the International Tree Planting - 1922 The burgeoning development to press for women's rights was somewhat different in Latin America than in North America. In the US-style model of individual freedom, rights for women meant women should have the same rights as men. The relational feminism which developed in Latin America was more geared to protect the rights that women gained as wives and mothers‚Äîrights that made them inherently different from men. Though different in some ways, in others, women's situation was the same, as 19th- century politicians believed that granting rights to minorities would undermine the authority of the state and threaten stability by overturning the social order. At the end of the century, women throughout the Americas began to participate in women's conferences and congresses as a way to discuss \\"scientific, economic, social and political issues\\". In Latin America, some of the important meetings were Latin American Scientific Congresses which met in various capitals: Buenos Aires (1898), Montevideo (1901), Rio de Janeiro (1905), and Santiago (1908). North American women participated in International Congresses of Women, including those held in Paris (1878), London (1899), Berlin (1904), Amsterdam (1908) and Stockholm (1911). U.S. interventionism which had expanded during the end of the colonial era through World War I increasingly brought criticism from Latin America and the Caribbean region. In an effort at reconciliation, diplomacy through Inter- American consultation rose and women formed regional networks to find regional solutions as well. Early hemispherical conferences looked for ways and means to improve education for women, provide for children, and promote social welfare programs. The 1922 Pan-American Conference of Women held in Baltimore, addressed those issues as well as peace throughout the region, socio-economic and political opportunities for women, and an end to trafficking of women. The Inter-American Commission of Women was established as part of the Pan-American Movement in 1928. It was the first body solely dedicated to women's issues involving governments of multiple states. One of the first goals set out by the organization was to address disparities in women's legal status in varying countries. Besides the issue of suffrage, women looked at whether their nationality was effected if they married, whether they maintained control of their assets upon marriage, whether they had equal custody over their children, if they could serve on juries, and many other issues. Their regional efforts resulted in passage of the first international agreement, the Convention on the Nationality of Women, ever adopted to protect women's rights. = Women in the Americas during wartime = Women work in a west coast United States airplane factory on drill presses in 1942. In Canada, women were first officially admitted to the military in 1885, where they worked as nurses in the North-West Resistance. During World War I, in the United States, as many men left to fight the war, women took over many jobs. The Woman's Land Army of America (WLA) helped women take over farming work, especially in California. Canadian women also worked in an organized fashion on home defense during World War I. Women in the United States were unable to join the military officially, but could work as civilian volunteers. In the United States, during World War II, \\"more than 310,000 women worked in the U.S. aircraft industry\\" and also contributed to the munitions industry. Women in Canada could join the auxiliary air force and army organizations in 1941 and approximately 50,000 women eventually joined.  Women and culture  = Traditional roles = After the European colonization of Canada, women played different traditional roles. Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widowed, and took over their husbands' roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right. Similarly, in the United States, women had more influence in the 'domestic' sphere, even though they often worked along with their husbands in colonial society. According to Tu√±√≥n Pablos, the women of Mexico had been \\"exalted in myth\\" but had remained \\"subordinated in their (...) role\\" in Mexican society throughout Mexico's history. = Early leadership roles for women in the Americas = Incan society had the concept of duality in gender parallelism during the pre-Columbian period. This allowed Incan women in the Andes of South America to have assertive roles in society. The country of Peru saw European women from Spain who were early conquistadores and encomenderas between the years of 1534 and 1620. There were at least 102 of these women who were political agents, had access to large amounts of wealth, had been granted hundreds or thousands of Native people to work for them as slaves.  Promoting gender equality for women in the Americas  Many countries in the Americas have provided legal frameworks for women to achieve equality with men. Constitutionally, the modern-day women of the Dominican Republic are equal to men in terms of rights and property ownership. Argentine women have attained a relatively high level of equality by Latin American standards, and in the Global Gender Gap Report prepared by the World Economic Forum in 2009, Argentine women ranked 24th among 134 countries studied in terms of their access to resources and opportunities relative to men.La Naci√≥n: Mujeres siguen siendo discriminadas Women in Brazil enjoy the same legal rights and duties as men, which are clearly expressed in the 5th article of Brazil's 1988 Constitution. A cabinet-level office, the Secretariat for Women's Affairs, oversees a special secretariat that has responsibility to ensure the legal rights of women. Although the law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, there were significant wage disparities between men and women. Women's educational attainment, workforce participation, and rights have improved, especially since Chile became a democracy again in 1990. Chile legalized divorce in 2004 and is also one of the few countries to have elected a female president. According to Countries and Their Cultures, there is a \\"very high proportion\\" of Uruguayan women participating in the labor force of the South American country. And that Uruguayan legislation maintains that the women of Uruguay have equal rights to power, authority, and privileges\\". In reality however women are still not occupying \\"higher economic, professional, political, social, and religious positions\\".Division of Labor by Gender, Gender Roles and Statuses, Uruguay, everyculture.com In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being \\"103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament\\" and that \\"only 12 per cent of the current members of the Chamber of Senators and Chamber of Deputies in Uruguay are women\\".Young Uruguayan women aim to boost their role in politics, UN Women, January 29, 2013 Culturally, the women of the Dominican Republic have an attitude that is known as machista behavior, where women understood and to a certain degree accepted the machismo nature of Dominican Republic men. By tradition, Dominican Republic women are expected to be submissive housewives. Similarly, women in Haiti have equal constitutionalConstitution of the Republic of Haiti, Title III: \\"Art. 17: All Haitians, regardless of sex or marital status, who have attained twenty-one years of age may exercise their political and civil rights if they meet the other conditions prescribed by the Constitution and by the law. Art. 18: Haitians shall be equal before the law, subject to the special advantages conferred on native-born Haitians who have never renounced their nationality.\\" rights as men in the economic, political, cultural and social fields, as well as in the family. However, the reality in Haiti is quite far from the law: \\"political, economic and social features of Haiti negatively affect most Haitians, but Haitian women experience additional barriers to the full enjoyment of their basic rights due to predominant social beliefs that they are inferior to men and a historical pattern of discrimination and violence against them based on their sex. Discrimination against women is a structural feature in Haitian society and culture that has subsisted throughout its history, both in times of peace and unrest.\\"Report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)on ‚ÄúThe Right of Women in Haiti to be Free from Violence and Discrimination.‚Äù OEA/Ser.L/V/II, Doc. 64, 10 March 2009. Gender inequality can be found in various areas of Salvadoran life such as employment, health, education, political participation, and family life. Although women in El Salvador enjoy equal protection under the law, they are often at a disadvantage relative to their male counterparts.United Nations, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Combined third and fourth periodic reports of States Parties, El Salvador, 2001 Honduras's ranking specific to gender inequality is 105th out of 146 countries, with an overall value of 0.511 out of 1 in terms of HDI (with 1 representing perfect inequality).UNDP. Human Development Report 2011: Sustainability and Equality. 2011. Technical Report. After the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution in which the Sandinistas led by Daniel Ortega deposed the dictatorial president Anastasio Somoza Debayle, they implemented a number of social reforms, including trying to eliminate gender inequality and improve female literacy rates. They also encouraged women to participate in the fight for social justice and equality (Source: BBC: In Pictures: Sandinista Revolution remembered: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- latin-america-10689502). According to the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme, in Bolivia \\"men receive more and better education than women, receive increased and better health assistance than women, and have the possibility to generate greater income while working less...if we consider that women, as opposed to men, also have...the almost exclusive responsibility for domestic work\\". Maternal mortality and illiteracy among women rate as some of the highest in the world. Bolivian women are also exposed to excessive machismo, being utilized as promotional tools in popular advertising which solidifies stereotypes and assumptions about women. = Cultural gains = Around the time of the American Revolution, women in the colonies gained greater access to the right to divorce. Women of Afro- Trinidadian mix commonly become \\"heads of households\\", thus with acquired \\"autonomy and power\\". By participating in Trinidad and Tobago's version of the Carnival, Trinidadian and Tobagonian women demonstrate their \\"assertive sexuality\\". Some of them have also been active in so-called Afro-Christian sects and in running the \\"sou-sou informal rotating credit associations\\". Polls conducted by Gallup in nine South American countries in 2007 found that attitudes about women's roles in those countries had shifted. Women were seen as being better able to cope with family and work demands than men and 69% of men felt that women should manage a household's money. = Women in government = alt=Erika Araceli Rodriguez Hern√°ndez, Federal Deputy for the fifth constituency in Mexico, 2016.thumb Erika Araceli Rodriguez Hern√°ndez, Federal Deputy for the fifth constituency in Mexico, 2016. Women hold 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the Cuban National Assembly ranking sixth of 162 countries on issues of female participation in political life. Panama had a female president as their national leader, in the person of Mireya Moscoso, who was Panama's first female president, serving from 1999 to 2004.Panama, everyculture.com Many Brazilian women have been elected mayors and many women have been federal judges. The first female assumed office in the Senate in 1979. Women became candidates for vice president for the first time in 1994. As of 2009, only 9% of the seats in the national parliament were held by women. = Women and the workplace = Women in the Americas have increasingly contributed to the workplace, gaining jobs that were once closed to women. In the book, Successful Professional Women in the Americas: From Polar Winds to Tropical Breezes, the authors identify qualities that women who have succeeded in various professional endeavors in the Americas share alike. These characteristics were \\"high levels of self-efficacy,\\" \\"an internal locus of control believing that success results from one's own behaviour\\" and \\"a need for achievement and a preference for challenging tasks.\\" In the United States, women have been extremely successful in employment relating to the pre-college and university education of children. Some women in Trinidad and Tobago now excel in occupations such as being microenterprise owners, \\"lawyers, judges, politicians, civil servants, journalists, and calypsonians\\". Other women dominate in the fields of \\"domestic service, sales, and some light manufacturing\\".Trinidad and Tobago, everyculture.com The women of the U.S. Virgin Islands are participating increasingly in the fields of economics, business, and politics.United States Virgin Islands, everyculture.com Argentine women have an economic clout in relation to men that is higher than in most Latin American countries,iEco: Brecha salarial and numerous Argentine women hold top posts in the Argentine corporate world;iEco: Las mujeres que manejan los millones among the best known are Cris Morena, owner of the television production company by the same name, Mar√≠a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, former CEO and majority stakeholder of Loma Negra, the nation's largest cement manufacturer, and Ernestina Herrera de Noble, director of Grupo Clar√≠n, the premier media group in Argentina. In some countries, there is more work to be done for there to be equality in the workplace based on gender. In 2009, the female labor force participation rate in El Salvador was 45.9 percent, compared to the male rate of 76.7 percent. Women have also been very influential in labor movements in the Americas. Puerto Rican women became citizens of the U.S.A. in 1917. Before that year - in 1898 - women form Puerto Rico were already active participants in the labor movement and agricultural economy in the island.Introduction, Puerto Rican Labor Movement During the period of industrialization, Puerto Rican women took jobs in the so-called \\"needle industry\\", working as seamstresses in garment factories. Woman mining gold in the Amazon river in Ecuador, 2014. Many women in the Americas still make a living in subsistence professions. In Bolivia and Brazil, women practice gold mining on a small-scale basis. Many women of Suriname work in the informal sector and in subsistence agriculture.Suriname, everyculture.com Some women living in French Guiana are from the Maroon society. Although matrilineal in nature, some Maroon women in French Guiana once acted only as assistants or basia to the kabiten or male leader. A common job for the Maroon women in French Guiana include cleaning work in coastal areas, particularly in the markets of Saint-Laurent and Cayenne to earn income that would support their children. = Education = Education-wise, women in Guyana have outperformed male Guyanese in regional examinations. There are currently more women in Guyana who attend education in universities than do men. Argentine women enjoy comparable levels of education with men, and somewhat higher school enrollment ratios than their male counterparts. They are well integrated in the nation's cultural and intellectual life.Educ.ar: La mujer y sus derechos In El Salvador, the percentage of males with at least a secondary education in 2010 was 47.5, compared to females at 40.5 percent.United Nations Development Programme, 2011 = Feminism = The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women's rights.  Sexual harassment and violence  During the times when slavery was legal in the Americas, enslaved women were often used as sexual objects and \\"had no recourse for sexual harm.\\" In Latin America, often those who commit acts of violence against women go \\"unpunished by legal systems that are ill-equipped to prosecute offenders or that sometimes show little interest in doing so.\\" Violence against women in Guatemala reached severe levels during the long-running Guatemalan Civil War (1960-1996), and the continuing impact of that conflict has contributed to the present high levels of violence against women in that nation. The total occurrences of femicide in Guatemala by the end of November 2011 were around 650 women killed; in 2010 the murder rate was 9 per 100,000 women, vice 41 per 100,000 for males. Claudia Paz y Paz, the attorney general in Guatemala has made violent crimes against women a priority and created a Criminal Court for Crimes of Femicide and Violence against Women.

The Alberta Energy Regulator's mandate under the Responsible Energy Development Act, passed on 10 December 2012 and proclaimed on 17 June 2013, is to provide safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of energy resources in the province. Under the REDA, the Alberta Government established the AER in December 2012 to provide a one- stop shop for regulatory approvals after industry complained about the delays and costs of red tape. The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act,https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/rsa-2000-c-p-40/latest/rsa-2000-c-p-40.html the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Acthttp://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/acts/e12.pdf and the Water Act.https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/rsa-2000-c-w-3/latest/rsa-2000-c-w-3.html The AER operates at arm's length from the Government of Alberta, under an appointed board of directors headed by Chair Gerry Protti, a former president of the oil industry lobby Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. On 17 June 2013, all regulatory functions previously carried out by the Energy Resources Conservation Board were taken over by the Alberta Energy Regulator. The Alberta Energy Regulator \\"regulates approximately 181,000 active wells, more than 50,000 oil and gas facilities, and of pipelines.\\" The AER also \\"considers some 36,800 applications for energy development every year.\\" Background Energy regulation in Alberta has a 76-year history, evolving over time to meet changing technologies and public needs. Following its creation in 1938 with the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, the regulatory body has consistently overseen energy development in the province. It has existed under several names throughout its history, including the Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, and the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board. The Alberta Energy Regulator builds off of this legacy, but it is, under the Responsible Energy Development Act, an entirely new organization with new regulatory functions and authority over energy-related applications and developments. = Responsible Energy Development Act = In December 2012, the Responsible Energy Development Act passed in the Alberta Legislature as part of the Regulatory Enhancement Project. The REDA made the Alberta Energy Regulator \\"responsible for all projects from application to reclamation,\\" with \\"the authority to administer the Public Lands Act, the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and the Water Act, with regards to energy development.\\" The Alberta Energy Regulator was phased in over nine months beginning in June 2013. In March 2014, the Alberta Energy Regulator became the single regulator for energy development in Alberta; it now enforces environmental laws and issues environmental and water permits for energy developments, which were formerly responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development. Responsibilities The Alberta Energy Regulator \\"ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and environmental protection while providing economic benefits for all Albertans.\\" These hydrocarbon resources are among the world's largest reserves at 167 billion barrels of bitumen and crude oil, 33.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 37 billion tons of coal. The Alberta Energy Regulator also regulates the infrastructure associated with these reserves, including a provincial pipeline network of 415,000 kilometres (km), over 181,000 operating wells, more than 50,000 oil and gas facilities, over 200 thermal oil sands projects, 9 oil sands mines, 11 coal mines, and 4 coal processing plants. The Government of Alberta has granted the AER authority to review and make decisions on proposed energy developments, to oversee all aspects of energy resource activities in accordance with government policies, to regularly inspect energy activities to ensure that all applicable requirements are met, to penalize companies that fail to comply with AER requirements, and to hold hearings on proposed energy developments. As the single regulator, it is responsible for all energy- related applications under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the Water Act, the Public Lands Act, and the Mines and Minerals Act. The AER also responds to concerns from landowners, First Nations, industry, and other stakeholders regarding energy regulations in Alberta and mediates disputes surrounding energy projects. In the past the Energy Resources Conservation Board and Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development conducted investigations separately, but, with the creation of a single regulatory body for energy developments, the Alberta Energy Regulator now conducts investigations and inspections to ensure compliance with all regulatory, environmental, and safety requirements. The AER can enforce industry compliance with regulations using tools that include more frequent and detailed inspections, more stringent planning requirements, enforcement orders, shutting down operations, administrative penalties,Fines under the Responsible Energy Development Act are limited to $500,000 or less for a corporation and $50,000 or less for an individual. and prosecution. The AER regularly posts details of compliance activities on the AER website, which also includes copies of all investigation reports. Since the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) was succeeded by AER, as part of their succession title pages of all existing ERCB directives such as Directive 074 regarding oil sands tailings ponds performance dated 3 February 2009, now carry the AER logo. Governance structure The AER's governance structure uses a corporate-style system to \\"achieve benefits of both strong corporate oversight and independent adjudication.\\" Thus, the board of directors determines the general direction of the regulator rather than overseeing the AER's day-to-day operations and decisions ‚Äî these are the responsibility of the chief executive officer. The CEO receives and makes decisions on applications, monitors and investigates energy resource activities for compliance, and oversees the closure of energy developments, including reclamation and remediation of the land. Hearing commissioners constitute another part of the AER's structure. They conduct all hearings into energy applications and regulatory appeals, in addition to helping to develop the organization's hearing procedures and rules as well as other day-to-day operations. Hearing commissioners are independent adjudicators, and their decisions may only be reviewed by the Court of Appeal of Alberta. AER chair, Gerry Protti was a former executive with Encana, the founding president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), and a long-time lobbyist for the Energy Policy Institute of Canada. The appointment was met with calls for his resignation as he was seen to be biased in favour of industry. The organization's governance structure, however, delegates decisions on contested applications and developments to the hearing commissioners, with the chair heading a board of directors tasked with setting performance expectations and approving regulatory change. Jim Ellis, a former deputy minister in environment and energy, was appointed as CEO by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. =Funding= The Alberta Energy Regulator is 100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas wells, oil sands mines, and coal mines. The industry-funded model is commonly used by regulatory agencies from various sectors across North America, such as the Alberta Utilities Commission and the BC Oil and Gas Commission. Its budget is established through a formal process between the Government of Alberta's Treasury Board and the AER, and the budget must be approved by the Government of Alberta. The AER has an annual budget of more than $165 million and more than 1200 staff working in 15 locations across Alberta. 2014 Gerry Protti, provided an overview of AER's first year in operation beginning April 2014, to one hundred participants at Green Regs & Ham in Calgary hosted by the Environmental Law Centre and sponsored by Devon Canada and Cenovus Energy. Protti described AER's \\"holistic approach\\" to oil and gas development and regulation under Alberta's Water Act and Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, the \\"adoption of \\"play- based\\" regulation, which focuses on regulating the surface and subsurface of a particular formation (as opposed to the traditional one well-one licence approach); use of a performance-based approach to regulate outcomes, which includes managing cumulative effects, minimizing spread of surface infrastructure, and conserving and managing water; and increased planning and collaboration among companies and community stakeholders.\\" During question period Protti admitted \\"despite working hard on it over the past year, the AER could have communicated better with the public.\\" 2015 During the 2015 IHS Inc. CERAWeek, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, praised Alberta's province's regulatory process for bringing critical regulatory \\"functions under one umbrella...[the AER]...decreasing duplication and costs and increasing efficiency.\\" Tillerson argued that the U.S. energy policy has not \\"kept up with rapid changes in the sector.\\" Critiques In March 2013, critics expressed concern that the AER would lead to less transparency in the regulation of the oil, gas and coal industry and would weaken environmental protection. Alberta Surface Rights Group, the United Landowners of Alberta, First Nations, farmers and ranchers have expressed concerns about the streamlining of regulatory processes that may benefit oil and gas industries at their expense. Energy Minister Ken Hughes argued that the Policy Management Office would oversee AER when it takes over from Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD) in issuing permits related to water and to the environment. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) welcomes the change that will streamline access to water and environmental permits for oil companies, by creating a one-stop-shop with \\"much needed clarity\\". Rachel Notley, the New Democrat's environment critic, expressed concern that the security of water and the environment would be compromised if the all decisions relating to development in the energy sector‚Äîincluding oil, gas and coal‚Äîare regulated under the AER, which is entirely funded by these industries. Prior to Bill 2, the Responsible Energy Development Act, the Alberta Environment regulated these permits under three provincial laws, the Water Act, the Public Lands Act, and the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. In an interview in June 2015 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley expressed concerns that the AER appeared to have a \\"conflicting mandate\\" as both an energy promoter and \\"the primary vehicle of environmental protection in Alberta\\" and considered splitting it. She was concerned that AER had \\"responsibility for most of the environmental protection and monitoring part and standards development within the energy sector.\\" Some in the oil industry insiders, such as Bill Andrew, CEO of Long Run Exploration, supports splitting up \\"AER‚Äôs functions because the current regulator has too much on its plate\\". Others, however such as Gary Leach, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, argue that AER's primary role is \\"environmental protection, public safety and resource conservation ‚Äî not the promotion of energy development,\\" and that the \\"many jurisdictions in North America and around the world\\" see AER \\"as a leading regulator for energy projects.\\" Global New's request for a freedom of information resulted in the release of AER CEO Laurie Pushor's April 20, 2020 \\"internal briefing note\\" consisting of 60 pages of emails. Investigations On 5 October 2019 three independent investigations into AER's International Centre of Regulatory Excellence (ICORE), submitted their findings. In response to a whistle blower complaint the three agencies‚Äîthe Alberta Ethics Commissioner Marguerite Trussler, the Public Interest Commissioner, and the Auditor General had undertaken launched separate probes into the AER in 2018.

Alliance for Open Society International, Inc., 570 U.S. 205 (2013), also known as Alliance for Open Society I (to distinguish it from the 2020 case), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which the court ruled that conditions imposed on recipients of certain federal grants amounted to a restriction of freedom of speech and violated the First Amendment.Agency for Int'l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, .  Facts  In 2003, the United States Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed a law providing federal government funds to private groups to help fight AIDS and other diseases all over the world, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). However, one of the conditions imposed by the law on grant recipients was a requirement, known as the anti-prostitution pledge, to have \\"a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking\\". Many AIDS agencies preferred to remain neutral on prostitution so as not to alienate the sex workers they work with to reduce HIV rates. DKT International filed a lawsuit in Washington, DC but the challenge to the law was defeated on appeal. Alliance for Open Society International and Pathfinder International filed another suit in 2005. In 2008, InterAction, and the Global Health Council joined the suit against the provision in a federal court in New York City, arguing that the requirement to promote a specific message violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The district court judge ruled in their favor, and the provision has effectively been blocked since. On appeal, the Second Circuit Court upheld the judge's decision.  Decision  In November 2012, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari filed by USAID, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Center for Disease Control. In a 6‚Äì2 decision, the court ruled in a majority written by Chief Justice John Roberts that the government cannot force a private organization to publicly profess a viewpoint that mirrors the government's view but is not held by the organization itself. Such a requirement would be considered a form of \\"leveraging\\" and violated the First Amendment protection of free speech. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas jointly filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the majority's ruling would prevent government funding for specific ideological programs.  Later case  While the U.S. government subsequently did not hold American NGOs to the Policy Requirement for funding, it continues to require foreign affiliates of these NGOs to the requirement. A new set of lawsuits on this action began, and while the case upheld the Supreme Court ruling, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5‚Äì3 decision in Agency for Int‚Äôl Development v. Alliance for Open Society in 2020 that the foreign affiliates were considered separate non- American entities of the American NGOs, and thus did not enjoy the First Amendment freedom of speech protections rights in this case.

Born in Ciamis, West Java, Iwa graduated from legal school in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Netherlands before spending time at a school in the Soviet Union. After returning to Indonesia he established himself as a lawyer, nationalist, and, later, a figure for workers' rights. During the first twenty years of Indonesia's independence Iwa held several cabinet positions. After retiring he continued to write. In 2002 Iwa was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. Early life Iwa was born in Ciamis, West Java, on 31 May 1899. After completing his primary education in schools run by the Dutch colonial government, he left for Bandung, where he attended the School for Native Government Employees (Opleidingsschool Voor Inlandse Ambtenaren, or OSVIA). Unwilling to adapt the Western culture demanded at the school, he dropped out and moved to Batavia (now Jakarta) to attend the law school; while in the colonial capital he also became involved with Jong Java, an organisation for Javanese youth. Iwa graduated in 1921 and continued his studies at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. In that country he joined the Indonesian Association(Perhimpoenan Indonesia), a nationalistic group of Indonesian intellectuals. He emphasised that Indonesians should work together, regardless of race, creed, or class, to ensure independence from the Dutch; he preached non-cooperation with colonial forces. In 1925 he moved to the Soviet Union to spend a year and a half studying at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow. In the Soviet Union he was briefly married to a Ukrainian woman named Anna Ivanova; the two had a daughter, Sumira Dingli, together. Upon returning to the Indies in 1927, Iwa joined the Indonesian National Party and worked as a lawyer. He later moved to Medan, in northern Sumatra, where he established the newspaper Matahari Terbit; the newspaper advocated workers rights and criticised the area's large Dutch-owned plantations. For these writings, and following an attempt to organise a labour union, in 1929 Iwa was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities and spent a year in jail before being exiled to Banda Neira, in the Banda Islands, for a period of ten years. While in Banda Iwa became a devout Muslim, although he continued to believe in the value of Marxism. He also met several leading nationalist figures also there in exiled, including Muhammad Hatta, Sutan Sjahrir, and Tjipto Mangunkusumo. Iwa later returned to Batavia and, during the Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì45) operated a law firm there. He also gave several lectures on nationalistic causes, under the watchful eye of the Japanese occupation forces. Post-independence As Japanese defeat in the Pacific became increasingly evident, Indonesian nationalist leaders began preparing for independence. Iwa suggested the use of the term proclamation, which was eventually used, and helped draft the Constitution of Indonesia, Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945. During the early months of the revolution which followed the proclamation, Iwa worked closely with the new, native, government. On 31 August he was selected as Minister of Social Affairs in the first cabinet under President Sukarno. He held the post until November 1945. He then joined the Struggle Union (), led by Tan Malaka. He was accused of involvement with the 3 July Affair in 1946, which led to the Indonesian government imprisoning him; other prisoners included Muhammad Yamin, Achmad Soebardjo, and Tan Malaka. The Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949, and in the new United States of Indonesia Iwa served as a member of the People's Representative Council until 1950. In 1953 Iwa was selected as Defence Minister for the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, under Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo; his term lasted until 1955. In 1957 Iwa became rector of Padjadjaran University in Bandung. His final political term, from 1963 to 1964, was as a government minister for the Fourth Working Cabinet. After his retirement from politics Iwa wrote extensively, often about history. Works published in this period include Revolusi Hukum di Indonesia (Legal Revolution in Indonesia), Sejarah Revolusi Indonesia (History of the Indonesian Revolution; in three volumes) and Pokok-Pokok Ilmu Politik (Tenets of Politics). He died on 27 November 1971 in Jakarta and was buried at Karet Bivak Cemetery. On 6 November 2002 Iwa was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. According to Indonesian historian Asvi Warman Adam, this was a prolapsed process owing to Iwa's affiliations with Tan Malaka and other communist interests, efforts not supported by the New Order government under President Suharto.

Ross in the Darkover series. It was first published by in hardcover by DAW Books in 2007. The book is the first in the \\"Children of Kings\\" trilogy. In terms of Darkover's timeline, the book starts three years after the death of Regis Hastur in Traitor's Sun, and is a continuation of that story. The book falls in the Darkover time period that the publisher has labeled \\"Modern Darkover\\", which succeeds the departure of the Terran Federation. Plot summary =Book One= Domenic Alton-Hastur arrives at Comyn Castle in Thendara, accompanying the body of his late grandmother, Javanne Lanart-Hastur. He is reunited with his cousin, Alanna Alar, an emotionally unstable young woman who is unable to control her outbursts of temper and laran. Domenic and Danilo Syrtis-Ardais learn that Alanna appears to have a version of the Elhalyn gift, which shows the possessor multiple possible futures. Alanna has no control over the gift, and the episodes of precognition come on her without warning. Danilo tells her she should go to Arilinn Tower for training, but she refuses. Domenic realizes that he is becoming increasingly attracted to Alanna, though he knows his family would object. They agree between themselves to a secret handfasting. Lew Alton is suffering increasing depression and nightmares. He confides in Danilo Syrtis- Ardais that he cannot shake the weight of the events of his life, particularly his participation in the Sharra catastrophe (see The Heritage of Hastur and Sharra's Exile) and the battle on the Old North Road (see Traitor's Sun). Danilo recommends a retreat at the cristoforo monastery, St.-Valentine-of-the- Snows. Though he is skeptical, Lew agrees to go. =Book Two= Jeram, a man living in a small village, begins to suffer Threshold Sickness. His family takes him to Neskaya Tower, where the keeper, Silvana, and her underkeeper, Illona, identifies him as a Terran. As he recovers his memories, he realizes that he participated in the battle on the Old North Road. Now self-identifying as Darkovan, he decides he must seek forgiveness from the Comyn Council. Silvana arranges a meeting between Jeram and Lew Alton, which proves healing for both men. Lew observes that Silvana has the Hastur gift (living matrix). He believes that she may be Kierestelli, the daughter of Regis Hastur entrusted for protection to the Chieri in Hastur Lord. Domenic arrives at Neskaya and reunites with Illona Rider. He realizes that he loves Illona far more than he does Alanna, despite his promise. He accompanies Lew, Jeram, and Illona back to Thendara. Illona tells Domenic that she accepts the nature of their relationship ‚Äì that she realizes they can never marry. They encounter a man who appears to be suffering from Trailmen's Fever (see The Planet Savers), which all believe to have been wiped out over 40 years prior. At Thendara, Jeram takes shelter in a transient camp. He meets Liam, an associate of Francisco Ridenow, who tells him that the Comyn Council will not agree to hear him. Liam turns out to be right. He takes Jeram to Francisco Ridenow, who appears sympathetic at first, but drugs Jeram and takes him prisoner. Under questioning, Jeram reveals that Lew and Marguerida used their Alton gift on the Terran forces during the battles of Comyn Castle and Old North Road, in violation of Comyn custom. =Book Three= Domenic, Lew, and Illona arrive at Comyn Castle in Thendara. Lew suffers a heart attack but survives. He asks Domenic to find Jeram, saying that he believes Jeram is in terrible danger. At the opening of Comyn Council season, Danilo Syrtis-Ardais proposes that nedestro offspring of the Comyn be seated in the council if they have laran. Accordingly, Kennard-Dyan Ardais legitimates three of his nedestro children, including Illona Rider. Alanna discovers Domenic in conversation with Illona, and realizes they are in love. She runs, and stumbles into a back passageway that leads to Lew Alton's bedroom. Alanna tells Lew her fears, and has the first honest exchange she has ever had with another human being. Again, as with Jeram, the experience is healing for both of them. The following day, Danilo Syrtis-Ardais surprises the Council with another revelation ‚Äì a candidate to fill the vacant Aillard seat, Darius-Mikhail Zabal. Francisco Ridenow brings a drugged and beaten Jeram into the council chamber and demands that he recite Ridenow's version of the battles of Comyn Castle and Old North Road. Despite his condition, Jeram resists. Marilla Lindir-Aillard collapses and confusion ensues. Undeterred, Ridenow accuses Mikhail Lanart-Hastur of holding power unlawfully. Francisco Ridenow challenges Mikhail to trial by single combat, and reluctantly, Mikhail agrees. Mikhail kills Ridenow, but not before he is wounded with a poisoned blade. The keepers attending Council join together to save Mikhail's life, but they are able only to slow the inevitable. Illona informs Marguerida that Marilla Lindir-Aillard's collapse was not caused by a heart attack, but by Trailmen's Fever. Marguerida takes a party to the abandoned Terran spaceport, to search out records of the vaccine created nearly 50 years earlier to treat a similar epidemic. With Jeram's assistance, they are able to retrieve the records. =Book Four= In one of the transient camp, Jeram's friend Ulm recovers from the fever. Jeram persuades him to donate blood to assist in finding a cure. The keepers join together to use laran to synthesize a cure, but the process is too slow. Marguerida uses her shadow matrix to make a sufficient quantity, but the effort traps her in the Overworld. Domenic joins his parents' hands, once again joining the ring of Varzil the Good that his father wears with his mother's Shadow Matrix. Marguerida uses their joint power to heal her husband's wound. With the epidemic receding, Comyn Council gathers again. Domenic announces his engagement to Alanna, but she declines, saying she needs training at a Tower to master her laran gifts. This leaves Domenic free to marry Illona. The Keeper's Council charges Marguerida with the misuse of her laran at the battle of the Old North Road, while acknowledging that she saved most of their lives by doing so. They require her to finish her Tower training, which had been interrupted by the events described in The Shadow Matrix. The council brings no charges against Lew, saying he is free to return to the St.-Valentine-of-the-Snows monastery. Jeram returns to his family and moves to Thendara to help prepare for the eventual return of the Federation.

She hires two children to guide them to Music Street in Thendara. Her conversation with the children ignites long-forgotten memories of the five years she lived on Darkover as a child. Several days after their arrival, Ivor dies in his sleep and is buried on Darkover. After the funeral, Marguerida is approached by Captain Rafe Scott, who tries to explain how they are related, but discovers that she knows nothing of her own family history. At Rafe's suggestion, Marguerida hires Rafaella n'ha Liriel, a Renunciate guide, to assist her in her folk music gathering project. They successfully gather many songs, but Marguerida's dreams begin to be troubled by long-repressed memories of her childhood on Darkover. Marguerida becomes ill and the pair take shelter at the Ardais estate. When the illness appears to be Threshold Sickness lasting several weeks, her host, Lady Marilla Aillard, sends for Istvana Ridenow, keeper of Neskaya Tower. Istvana becomes aware of a presence in Marguerida's mind that occasionally controls her. With Istvana and Marilla's assistance, Marguerida confronts the presence, which turns out to be the will of a long- dead Keeper, Ashara Alton. Marguerida recognizes a keystone, a visual representation of Ashara's hold on her, and takes hold of it. She is able to dislodge the keystone with the unexpected assistance of Mikhail Lanart-Hastur, another house guest whom she barely knows. The experience leaves a \\"shadow matrix\\" in her right hand ‚Äì the blue glowing outlines of the keystone that function as a matrix. Having broken the \\"tower of mirrors,\\" Marguerida begins to recover. Gabriel Lanart-Alton, Marguerida's uncle and Warden of Alton, arrives at Ardais. He demands that she decamp to the Alton estate, Armida, and finds himself on the losing end of a very loud fight. In the end, Marguerida hears her father's voice telling her that it will be alright if she goes to Armida. Before she leaves for Armida, Marguerida has an unexpected conversation with Mikhail. He tells her that his parents want to marry her off to one of his brothers and asks her to promise that she won't allow this. She assures him that she won‚Äôt allow herself to be married against her will, though both of Mikhail's brothers do eventually propose. She turns down both of them. At Armida, she finds her aunt and uncle, Javanne and Gabriel Lanart- Hastur, to be conservative, and they are shocked by her unconventional life and opinions. More to her liking are her uncle, Jeff Kerwin (see The Bloody Sun), and cousin, Liriel, a matrix technician from Arilinn Tower. However, Liriel's twin, Ariel, is so unnerved by Marguerida that she and her family abruptly leave Armina, inadvertently causing a carriage accident that leaves one of her sons mortally injured. Ariel blames Marguerida. In the midst of the commotion, Lew Alton, Marguerida‚Äôs father, arrives at Armida. He informs his relations that Dio, his wife, is ill and has remained behind in Thendara. He also explains that he has resigned as Darkover's representative to the Terran Federation Senate, and has been replaced by Herm Aldaran. Another loud argument with Javanne ensues. During the night, Donal Alar, a young boy, attempts to frighten Marguerida as a prank. She unintentionally uses Command Voice -- a trait of the Alton telepathic gift -- on him and send his spirit into the Overworld. with the support of her relatives Marguerida returns to the Tower of Mirrors in the Overworld, greets her dead mentor Ivor and successfully returns young Donal to his body. Marguerida, Lew, Mikhail, Jeff, and others undertake the journey back to Thendara so that Marguerida can see her dying step-mother, Diotima. In telepathic discussions with Mikhail, Marguerida admits that she needs to remain on Darkover and gain control of her new laran abilities. Mikhail explains the unspoken objection everyone has to their relationship ‚Äì that a marriage between Mikhail and Marguerida would concentrate too much power, both political and laran, in a single couple. During the trip, she points to the ruin of Hali Tower and asks what it is. It becomes clear that she sees the tower as it originally stood, while everyone else sees the ruins, foreshadowing events in The Shadow Matrix. The traveling party arrives at Comyn Castle. Marguerida discovers that her months of experiences on Darkover have left her more comfortable in the castle than she was the first time. Regis calls a meeting in the Crystal Chamber of whats left of the Comyn. He explains that the Telepathic Council (see The World Wreckers) has not provided sufficient leadership for Darkover. He further explains that the Elhalyn line has essentially gone extinct, leaving no one to inherit the Elhalyn kingship. These two problems leave Darkover vulnerable to Terran predation.

Life  Dimara was born in Korem, North Biak, Papua on 9 October 1916. He graduated from basic training at Ambon in 1935. He then entered the School of Agriculture at the Laha in 1940. He then entered the School of Education Gospel. After graduation, he became a gospel teacher in Buru Island. In 1946, he participated in the Red and White flag hoisting in Namlea, Buru island. He helped fight for the return of territory of West Papua into the hands of the Indonesian Republic. In 1950, he was appointed Chairman of OPI (Liberation Organization of West Papua). As a serviceman of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (as part of the Indonesian Army), he took part in a 1954 infiltration mission to West Papua and was arrested by the Netherlands New Guinea government. He was thrown into Digul prison until being released in 1960. When President Sukarno proclaimed Operation TRIKORA in 1962, he and Bung Karno became figures of the young people of Papua and they were invited to TRIKORA headquarters in Yogyakarta. He also called on the entire community in West Papua and Papuans nationwide to participate in order to support the union of West Papua as a constituent territory of the Republic. In 1962, the New York Agreement was held. He became a part of the delegation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. The content of the agreement ultimately required the Dutch Kingdom to be willing to surrender West Papua to the government of Indonesian Republic, effective 1 May 1963. On Independence Day, 17 August 1962, a pro-integration rally was held in front of the palace (that time there being no Monas) and Dimara, wearing chains, was severed in front of the crowds at Lapangan Banteng, Jakarta. Bung Karno saw that moment and was inspired to make a statue of the liberation of West Irian. Thus, the West Irian Liberation Monument built in honor of the integration of Papua is less than from Merdeka Palace at the grounds of Lapangan Banteng. Dimara's story was told in a book written by Carmelia Sukmawati called Fai Do Ma, Mai Do Fa, Son Struggle Across Papua, JA Dimara (2000).

Prior to that, Oliveira served as a worker for \\"the big ice-cream companies\\". Wanting to create ice cream flavors that would appeal more to consumers, he broke out and started Coromoto. The parlour started out with four common flavors, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and coconut, however when its avocado favour, launched for its novelty value, became a hit, he started experimenting. By the time, he created flavour No. 593 called \\"Chipi Chipi\\", after its ingredient a saltwater shellfish, the Guinness Book incorporated his name in their book. In 2006, the shop opened its first franchise, \\"Coromoto\\" at Portim√£o on the southern coast of Portugal and 185 miles south of capital Lisbon. It is opened by his eldest son, also named Manuel Da Silva Oliveira, and Oliveira thereafter divides his time between Venezuela and Portugal.

It is located in Rigensgade (, central Copenhagen. History The original design which was somewhat simplified prior to its completion The first Methodist congregation in Denmark was founded on 11 January 1859 and was based in rented rooms in Store Kongensgade. The congregation grew rapidly and funds were raised for a new church which was completed in 1866 to designs by Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen. The church was known as St. Paul's Church until 1894 when that name was taken over by the nearby St. Paul's Church. It was then called St. Mark's Church until 1912 when it received its current name. The church was destroyed in a fire in 1914. It was subsequently rebuilt by Jens Christian Kofoed and reinaugurated the following year. Architecture The church is designed in a mixture of Romanesque Revival and Byzantine Revival styles. It is 27 metres long, 16 metres wide and the tower stands 50.6 metres tall.

Biography Moewardi was born in Pati, Central Java, in 1907. After studying at STOVIA (a school for native doctors) in Batavia (now Jakarta), he began studying as a specialist in throat, nose, and ear infections. He also chaired the city's branch of Jong Java. He practised medicine extensively during the Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì45). After the Japanese defeat in the Pacific, Indonesian politicians began preparing to proclaim the country's independence from Dutch colonial control. Moewardi, by this time living in Surakarta, established the Barisan Pelopor. This group which organised security at Ikada Square (now Merdeka Square) in Jakarta, to help secure the proclamation. Moewardi was one of the speakers at the event. Afterwards, Moewardi tasked his men with organising security for new president Sukarno and vice-president Mohammad Hatta, as well as other government figures. Moewardi was offered the position of Minister of Defence but refused it; the position went, in absentia, to Supriyadi. During the Indonesian National Revolution there was extensive military contact between Dutch and Indonesian forces. By early 1946 the capital was under Dutch control, and the nascent government abandoned Jakarta for Yogyakarta. Moewardi moved Barisan Pelopor to Surakarta and renamed it Barisan Banteng; the group was eventually merged into the Indonesian Army. Moewardi would accompany them in battles, helping the injured. Afterwards, Moewardi established a hospital and medical school in Surakarta. In 1948 he, together with a faction of other groups opposed to the Renville Agreement, established the (People's Revolution Movement). On 13 September 1948, while en route to his practice, Moewardi was kidnapped by the Communist Party of Indonesia and later murdered. He had previously attempted to organise a team to confront the communists following the Madiun Affair, and the city itself had little semblance of government. Moewardi was deemed a National Hero of Indonesia on 9 August 1964. A hospital in Surakarta and street in Jakarta are both named after him.
