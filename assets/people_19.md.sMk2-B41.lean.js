The full Italian official name was Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi. History Stamp of the Academy of Arcadia The beginnings of the Accademia degli Arcadi date to February 1656, when a literary circle formed under the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had abdicated the Swedish crown in 1654, converted to Catholicism, and taken up her residence in Rome, where she spent much of the rest of her life. There she became a significant patron of music and opera, with composers including Alessandro Scarlatti, Alessandro Stradella and Arcangelo Corelli dedicating works to her. After her death in 1689, the academy was established in her memory and elected her as its symbolic head (basilissa, the Greek term for 'Queen'). The Academy lasted for the next two hundred years, remaining a leading cultural institution into the 20th century. The Accademia degli Arcadi was so called because its principal intention was to reform the diction of Italian poetry, which the founders believed had become corrupt through over-indulgence in the ornamentation of the baroque style, under the inspiration of pastoral literature, the conventions of which imagined the life of shepherds, originally supposed to have lived in Arcadia in the golden age, divinely inspired in poetry by the Muses, Apollo, Hermes and Pan. The Academy chose as its emblem the pipe of Pan with its seven unequal reeds. The fourteen founders selected as the first Custode di Arcadia or president of the academy, Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni who was the author of a history of Italian poetry and of various literary works. The Arcadians resolved to return to the fields of truth, always singing of subjects of pastoral simplicity and drawing their inspiration from Greco-Roman bucolic poetry. The ideal parameters for the artistic work were simplicity and a sense of measure and beauty. Common to all the poets was the desire to oppose the poetry of the Marinists, and return to classic poetry, embracing also the recent rationalist influence of Descartes. Norms and rituals of the academy took their cue from classic and pastoral mythology, as in the custom of assuming 'pastoral' names; (Crescimbeni, for example, chose that of Alfesibeo Cario). The fourteen founder members included the librettist Silvio Stampiglia and the poet Vincenzo Leonio. The first solemn gathering of the Arcadians was held on the Janiculum hill, in a wood belonging to the Reformed Minorites, on 5 October 1690. In 1692, the meetings were transferred to the gardens of Duke Orsini on the Esquiline hill; in 1696, to the Farnese Gardens on the Palatine. Finally, the generosity of John V of Portugal, one of its members under the name of Arete Melleo, enabled the society to secure (1723) on the Janiculum a site known as the Bosco Parrasio or (Parrasian Grove). Here they held their meetings in summer days, in winter moving to the Teatro degli Arcadi in the Palazzo Salviati. In 1696 the Accademia admitted seven musicians including Giovanni Bononcini. While the academy was still on the Palatine, its Statuto or Constitution was drawn up. This constitution (the work of co- founder Gian Vincenzo Gravina) was modelled on the ancient Roman laws of the 'Twelve Tables', and was engraved on marble. Differing tendencies soon asserted themselves, following the ideas of the two founders: that of Gravina stood in the tradition of Homer and Dante, while that of Crescimbeni was more influenced by Petrarch. Because of these differences Gravina left to found the Accademia dei Quirini in 1711. Despite this loss, Arcadia retained its vigour in the following years, and created colonies in many cities of Italy. Many noblemen, ecclesiastics, and artists held membership of it to be an honour, and very soon it numbered 1,300. Much of what they produced, however, was either mediocre or pretentious (an example is Saverio Bettinelli's disparagement of Dante), although the Academy did receive some endorsement for its attack on the redundant Rococo style, then dominant in art and literature. The celebrated opera librettist Pietro Metastasio (1698–1782) although he had his own differences with Arcadia, was a student of Gravina's, and a leading light of the academy's second generation. His works, of which the best remembered might be Il Re Pastore because of its setting by Mozart, may represent the closest thing to a justification of its program that Arcadia achieved. In 1795, the academy admitted the Italian Diodata Saluzzo Roero, as one of its first female members,Letizia Panizza & Sharon Wood (2000). \\"A History of Women's Writing in Italy\\". p. 144. but already in the 17th century the poet Maria Antonia Scalera Stellini was elected a member. A violent anti- Arcadian reaction soon developed, and, starting from the early 19th century, Arcadianism began to be regarded as a late and unconvincing expression of the ancien régime. After the end of the French Revolution, the Academy strove to renew itself in accord with the spirit of the times, without sacrificing its traditional system of sylvan associations and pastoral names. The Academy no longer represented a literary school, but a general interest in the classics, and figures like Dante came to be greatly honoured by its members. Furthermore, the Academy's field of endeavour was enlarged to include many branches of study, including history and archaeology. The new Arcadian revival was marked by the foundation (1819) of the Giornale Arcadico. In 1925 the Academy was renamed to become the Arcadia – Accademia Letteraria Italiana, a historical institute. The Accademia degli Arcadi counted among its members some of the principal literary men and women of the time, including Menzini, Redi, Metastasio, Rolli, Guidi, Clotilde Tambroni and others. The famous composer George Frideric Handel is known to have often attended the meetings and symposia of the Arcadians when studying in Italy, under the patronage of Ruspoli, a leading member of the Academy. There is an interesting account of the Academy's history and program in Goethe's 'Italian Journey'. The archives of the academy are currently housed in the Biblioteca Angelica, next to the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome. The paintings are housed in the Palazzo Braschi. Atti e memorie dell'Accademia letteraria italiana was published by the academy.Copac record; accessed 19 July 2019 NotesReferences * Barroero, L. and Susinno, S.

His artwork has become a global phenomenon and his images are an internet sensation. Early life, education, and work Wenner was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1958, but grew up in Santa Barbara, California. He attended Rhode Island School of Design and Art Center in California. While at Art Center he was recruited to work for NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Media coverage Wenner invented 3D pavement artk and is known for driving the media and generating social media buzz with his images. He has taken on many cause-related works of art to raise awareness of things such as the Colorado River running dry, poor air quality, and more. In 2010, Greenpeace called for a ban of genetically modified crops by presenting the European Union members in Brussels with one million signatures on a petition. It was the first time the EU members forced a vote by invoking the 1-million member signature rule. Wenner was asked to create a 3D image to commemorate the historical day when the people of Europe stood up, voicing action for no GMO in their food. Wenner's enormous 3D image was at the center of this historical moment. His work has been in more than 30 countries around the world. An advocate of arts education, he says it must be taught properly. Wenner points out that at no other time in the past 500 years, and with an abundance of Universities across the globe, do so few people know how to draw. In 1991, he received the Kennedy Center Medallion for his outstanding contribution to the arts. Wenner works on a variety of commissions. His most recent being for 23 murals and portraits at the soon to open Legacy Center in San Diego. He sells his fine art through gallery, and accepts a limited number of private commissions each year in addition to 3D event work.

It infects an estimated 22 million people yearly worldwide. It is particularly common in East Asia. More than 30 species of trematodes (flukes) of the genus Paragonimus have been reported; among the more than 10 species reported to infect humans, and only 8 bringing about infections in humans, the most common is P. westermani, the oriental lung fluke. Life cycle The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a detailed description and an explanatory image of the Paragonimus lifecycle: > The eggs of the paragonimiasis are excreted unembryonated in the sputum, or > alternately they are swallowed and passed with stool. In the external > environment, the eggs become embryonated, and miracidia hatch and seek the > first intermediate host, a snail, and penetrate its soft tissues. Miracidia > go through several developmental stages inside the snail: sporocysts and > rediae, with the latter giving rise to many cercariae, which emerge from the > snail. The cercariae invade the second intermediate host, a crustacean such > as a crab or crayfish, where they encyst and become metacercariae. This is > the infective stage for the mammalian host. Human infection with P. > westermani occurs by eating inadequately cooked or pickled crab or crayfish > that harbor metacercariae of the parasite. The metacercariae excyst in the > duodenum, penetrate through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, > then through the abdominal wall and diaphragm into the lungs, where they > become encapsulated and develop into adults (7.5 to 12 mm by 4 to 6 mm). The > worms can also reach other organs and tissues, such as the brain and > striated muscles, respectively. However, when this takes place completion of > the life cycles is not achieved, because the eggs laid cannot exit these > sites. Time from infection to oviposition (laying of eggs) is 65 to 90 days. > Infections may persist for 20 years in humans. Animals such as pigs, dogs, > and a variety of feline species can also harbor P. westermani.  Background  The first human case was seen in 1879 in Taiwan. An autopsy was done and adult trematodes were found in the lungs. The adult flukes have a reddish-brown in color with an ovoid shape. They have two muscular suckers, the first an oral sucker located anteriorly and the second a ventral sucker located mid-body. The adult flukes can live up to 20 years. The eggs are golden brown in color and are asymmetrically ovoid. They have a very thick shell. As seen above, these trematodes have a very complex life cycle with seven distinct phases involving intermediate hosts and humans. These seven phases are outlined as follows: eggs reach fresh water where they develop into miracidia. These penetrate many species of aquatic snails (first intermediate host) where they go through three distinct stages: first sporocysts, then rediae, and finally cercariae, also referred to as the larvae. These larvae released into water and penetrate crabs, crayfish and other crustaceans (second intermediate host). The cercariae situate themselves into the gills, liver and muscles where they further develop into metacercariae. When the parasite-filled crustacean is eaten, the metacercariae hatch in the intestine. These young worms penetrate intestinal wall, peritoneum, the diaphragm and the pleura where they finally reach the lungs. Here they live in pairs, lay eggs that are coughed up in sputum to restart the cycle. Geographic distribution There are more than 30 known species of Paragonimus. Species of Paragonimus are widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and North and South America. Paragonimus westermani is found in southeast Asia and Japan, while Paragonimus kellicotti is endemic to North America. Paragonimus africanus is found in Africa and Paragonimus mexicanus is found in central and South America. Just as the species names imply, paragonimiasis is more prominent in Asians, Africans and Hispanics because of their habitats and cultures.

It was classified by Carl Alexander Clerck in 1759, and is also known under the name of Euclidia mi. In Finnish it is known as piirtoyökkönen and in German as Scheck-Tageule. Variations Variations include: *Callistege mi ab. ochrea Tutt has the ground colour of hindwing yellow; this is the usual form in Britain, where sometimes the forewing also is tinged with yellowish: the underside of both being yellow; *Callistege mi ab. illuminata ab. nov.

[Warren] from Portugal the ground colour is orange yellow. Distribution This species spans over most of Europe, Siberia, the Russian Far East and Asia Minor. On the British Isles it is most common in England and Wales; less so in Scotland and Ireland.Catalogue of Life Technical description Mounted specimen The adult moth's forewing is 13 to 16 mm (0.51 to 0.63 inches) long, and the wingspan is 25 to 30 mm (0.98 to 1.18 inches). Forewings are black slightly dusted with grey. Lines are whitish, the subbasal ending in a grey- edged black spot on inner margin; the inner is obliquely curved outwards; the outer is angled at vein 6, indented on 4 and angled inwards below vein 2, running upwards and outwards below reniform, then downwards again parallel to its former course, and finally running in to the inner line above inner margin. Orbicular stigma is a round black spot with grey outline; reniform large and black, edged externally by a white bar, which often emits a narrow pale line externally from its middle subterminal line sinuous, double, somewhat lunulate, with dark centre and pale-scaled edges, except at costa where it is single and white, preceded by oblong black spots separated by the pale veins. Hindwings have the cell ochreous white, containing a black cellspot; outer and subterminal sinuous series of ochreous white spots between the veins. Fringe of both wings are mottled black and white, with pale line at base; underside is ochreous white.Seitz, A. Ed., 1914 Die Großschmetterlinge der Erde, Verlag Alfred Kernen, Stuttgart Band 3: Abt. 1, Die Großschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen eulenartigen Nachtfalter, 1914 The larva is yellowish with a dorsal line dark, finely pale in centre and with several fine wavy lines on each side. The spiracular line is broad, dark reddish brown, edged below with yellow or red. Biology Larva The stages of its life cycle are as follows: egg: MaySeptember, larva: JuneSeptember, pupa: JulyMay, and imago: MayJuly. It flies by day, normally taking only short, rapid flights, and can be found in wasteland and other open habitats. It hibernates as a pupa, and does so in a cocoon among blades of grass, or right underneath the ground. Among its foods is the nectar of the white clover and the creeping buttercup. Larva feed on Elymus arenarius, Polygonum aviculare, Lathyrus pratensis, Vicia spp., Calluna vulgaris, Hypericum maculatum, Andromeda polifolia, Galium verum, Melilotus officinalis, Lotus corniculatus and Medicago lupulina. Human culture Old engraving of Mother Shipton The popular, English name for this moth comes from the pattern on its forewing. This pattern resembles the iconic representation of Ursula Southeil, known as Mother Shiptona sixteenth-century prophetess and witch. Mother Shipton is a mostly mythical character, who supposedly foretold the death of Cardinal Wolsey in 1530. Charles Hindley, a nineteenth-century bookseller, created a prophetic poem that he claimed to be by Shipton. This poem told of \\"Carriages without horses\\" and air planes, as well as predicting the end of the world in 1881.

He took over 1,000 wickets for Derbyshire, and was prominent in their 1936 Championship season. Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, noted Copson was, \\"a flame-haired pace bowler with a temper to match, became a cricketer by accident\\". Life and career Bill Copson was born in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, and became a miner. Like his fellow bowler, Tommy Mitchell, he was a cricketing product of the 1926 General Strike. He took no interest in cricket until the Strike, when some fellow miners persuaded him to join in cricket on the local recreation ground while they were absent from work. His ability as a bowler of considerable pace and exceptional straightness, who made the batsmen play every ball was clearly revealed. In the next season he was given a place in the Morton Colliery team and, from there, he progressed to Clay Cross club in the Derbyshire League, and his success was such that Derbyshire engaged him in 1932.Wisden Obituaries - William Copson He made his debut in first-class cricket for Derbyshire against Surrey when he sensationally dismissed Andy Sandham with his first ball. However, his record for the rest of the season was moderate. In 1933, Copson became a regular member of the Derbyshire side, and, if he did not, in spite of his short run-up, possess the build to undertake as much work as fast bowlers were expected to then, he was consistently good in a summer unfavourable to bowlers. In the following two summers, Copson was so plagued by injury that there were serious worries about his long-term health. When he did play he developed so well that he headed Derbyshire's averages in 1935, for a team that recorded more victories than any other Derbyshire side before or since. Having been sent to Skegness to restore his health, he responded with a marvellous season in 1936. His 12 for 52 against the strong Surrey batting side on an admittedly damaged pitch was his finest feat. In all, he took 140 wickets for less than 13 runs each in the County Championship, and was chosen for the Ashes tour at the end of the season. Though he headed the averages for all matches, Copson's body was not resilient enough for the timeless matches on rock-hard Australian pitches, and he did not play in any of the Tests. In 1937, Copson suffered more injury problems, but featured one of the most magnificent bowling feats in county cricket history when he took 8 for 11 - including the first performance in first-class cricket of five wickets with six consecutive balls - against Warwickshire on a pitch giving bowlers almost no help. Copson also took 8 for 64 against Sussex on a good pitch, and the following year took 103 wickets, but could not dislodge Farnes and Bowes from the Test team. At last, Copson played his first Test against the West Indies in 1939 at Lord's and did not disappoint, taking nine wickets on a blameless pitch, including five in the first innings. He took 146 wickets that year, but World War II put paid to him being a regular Test bowler. By 1946, he had lost a yard of pace, and, if he could bowl straighter than anyone, he had not the venom of pre-war years. Copson did play one Test in 1947 with almost no success, but retired at the age of 41 in 1949. Copson was a right-arm fast medium bowler, and took 1,094 first-class wickets at an average of 18.96, with a best performance of 8 for 11. He also took 15 Test wickets. He was a right-hand batsman, and played 359 innings in 279 first- class matches, with an average of 6.81, and a top score of 43.Bill Copson at Cricket Archive From 1958 to 1967, Copson was a first-class umpire, but persistent health problems took so much toll, that he died in Clay Cross, Derbyshire, at the age of 63 in 1971.

Some of the media it is used in are painting, photography, sculpture and installation, toys, and film special effects. The word \\"anamorphosis\\" is derived from the Greek prefix ana‑, meaning \\"back\\" or \\"again\\", and the word morphe, meaning \\"shape\\" or \\"form\\". An oblique anamorphism is the visualization of a mathematical operation called an affine transformation. The process of extreme anamorphosis has been used by artists to disguise caricatures, erotic and scatological scenes, and other furtive images from a casual viewer, while revealing an undistorted image to the knowledgeable spectator. Types of projection Example of mirror anamorphosis There are two main types of anamorphosis: perspective (oblique) and mirror (catoptric). More complex anamorphoses can be devised using distorted lenses, mirrors, or other optical transformations. Examples of perspectival anamorphosis date to the early Renaissance (fifteenth century). The first examples were largely related to religious themes. With mirror anamorphosis, a conical or cylindrical mirror is placed on the drawing or painting to transform a flat distorted image into an apparently undistorted picture. The deformed image is created by using the laws of the angles of the incidence of reflection. This reduces the length of the flat drawing's curves when the image is viewed in a curved mirror, so that the distortions resolve into a recognizable picture. Unlike perspective anamorphosis, catoptric images can be viewed from many angles. The technique was originally developed in China during the Ming Dynasty. The first European manual on mirror anamorphosis was published around 1630 by the mathematician Vaulezard. With Channel anamorphosis or tabula scalata two different images are on different sides of a corrugated carrier. A straight frontal view shows an unclear mix of the images, while each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle. HistoryPrehistory= The Stone Age cave paintings at Lascaux may make use of anamorphic technique, because the oblique angles of the cave would otherwise result in distorted figures from a viewer's perspective. The ancient historians Pliny and Tzetzes both record a sculpture competition between Alcamenes and Phidias to create an image of Minerva. Alcamenes' sculpture was beautiful, while Phidias' had grotesque proportions. Yet once both had been mounted on pillars, the decelerated perspective made Phidias' Minerva beautiful and Alcamenes' ugly. =Renaissance= The Ambassadors with a memento mori anamorph skull in the foreground, 1533 Viewed from the correct oblique angle, the diagonal in The Ambassadors transforms into an undistorted memento mori. During the Renaissance, artists' experimentation with optics and perspective led to more advanced development of anamorphic imagery. At this time, religious thought and science were equally important to the technique's growth in Europe. The earliest known example, known as Leonardo's Eye, was executed by Leonardo da Vinci and is included in the Codex Atlanticus (1483-1518). He later completed several large-scale anamorphic commissions for the King of France. Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola credited Tommaso Laureti as the originator of a perspectival anamorphic technique in one of the earliest written descriptions in The Two Rules of Practical Perspective, compiled between 1530 and 1540 but not published until 1583. Without access to Vignola's work, many other descriptions and examples were created before 1583. The Ambassadors (c. 1533) by Hans Holbein the Younger is well known for the prominent oblique anamorphic transformation in the painting. In this artwork, a distorted shape lies diagonally across the bottom of the frame. Viewing this from an acute angle transforms it into the plastic image of a human skull. The painting is regarded as a vanitas – a meditation on the transience of life – with the skull a symbolic memento mori. The altered perspective required to see the image reflects the contemporary practice of painting skulls on the reverse of otherwise tranquil paintings. Four centuries later, the painting inspired the psychoanalyst Jaques Lacan to note in ‘Of the Gaze as Objet Petit a’ (1973) that the use of anamorphism, particularly in this painting, is one of the few methods for making viewers aware of their gaze. =17th century= By the 17th century, a revival of fantastical anamorphic imagery occurred. Magical and religious connotations were largely abandoned, and the images were understood as a scientific curiosity. Two major works on perspective were published: Perspective (1612) by Salomon de Caus, and Curious Perspective (1638) by Jean- Francois Niceron. Each contained extensive scientific and practical information on anamorphic imagery. In Niceron's work, three types of large- scale anamorphism are explained: 'optical' (looking horizontally); 'anoptric' (looking upwards); and 'catoptric' (looking down i.e. from a mezzanine). A conical perspective is also described. Towards the end of the century, Charles Ozanam's Mathematical Recreations widely popularized the techniques for the creation of anamorphic images. Between 1669 and 1685, both perspective and mirror anamorphosis were introduced in China by the Jesuits to the Emperor K'ang-hi and monks at the Peking Mission. However, Chinese production of anamorphic images were already occurring on a large scale during the late Ming Dynasty. The images were mostly created freehand, unlike the grid system used in the west. As Chinese anamorphoses primarily focused on erotic themes, Jesuit influence is unlikely. It is considered likely that Chinese catoptric techniques, which are technically unrelated to geometric anamorphosis, influenced European mirror anamorphosis, and not the other way around. Andrea Pozzo's painted ceiling in the Church of St. Ignazio, 1690 Baroque trompe l'oeil murals often used anamorphism to combine actual architectural elements with illusory painted elements to create a seamless effect when viewed from a specific location. The dome and vault of the Church of St. Ignazio in Rome, painted by Andrea Pozzo, represented the pinnacle of illusion. Due to neighboring monks complaining about blocked light, Pozzo was commissioned to paint the ceiling to look like the inside of a dome, instead of building a real dome. As the ceiling is flat, there is only one spot where the illusion is perfect and a dome looks undistorted. Anamorphosis could be used to conceal images for privacy or personal safety, and many secret portraits were created of deposed royalty. A well-known anamorphic portrait of the English King Edward VI was completed a year before his death in 1546, only visible when viewed through a hole in the frame. It was later hung at Whitehall Palace, and may have influenced Shakespeare during the writing of Richard II. Many anamorphic portraits of King Charles I were created and shared following his 1649 execution. A secret mirror anamorphosis portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie, held at the West Highland Museum, can only be recognized when a polished cylinder is placed in the correct position. To possess such an image would have been seen as treason in the aftermath of the 1746 Battle of Culloden. =18th and 19th century= The eighteenth century saw anamorphism completely enter the realm of entertainment and diversion, as well as the widest dissemination of the technique. By the 19th century, a revival of interest in anamorphism for architectural illusion occurred, as well as a fashion for classical themes. Reprints of Renaissance-era engravings became popular, as did political, obscene and popular subjects. Edgar Allen Poe's famous poem Ligeia describes a room filled with \\"simple monstrosities\\" that resolve in to \\"an endless succession of ... ghastly forms\\" as the narrator walks through the room. This mass popularization was to later have effect on the Surrealists. =20th century= By the twentieth century, some artists wanted to renew the technique of anamorphosis for aesthetic and conceptual effect. During the First World War, Arthur Mole, an American commercial photographer, used anamorphic techniques to create patriotic images from massive assembled groups of soldiers and reservists. When seen from a tower at their base, the gathered people resolved into recognizable pictures. Marcel Duchamp was interested in anamorphosis. His last work Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas (1946–66) used mild anamorphosis to force viewers into the position of peep-hole voyeurs in order to see a nude, anonymous human body. Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí used extreme foreshortening and anamorphism in his paintings and works. A glass floor installed in a room next to his studio enabled radical perspective studies from above and below. The Dalí Theatre and Museum features a three-dimensional anamorphic living-room installation; the Mae West Lips Sofa that looks like the face of the film star when seen from a certain viewpoint. Interestingly, Lacan also compared Holbein's 16th-century painting to Dali's imagery, rather than the other way around. Impossible objects Necker cube on the left, impossible cube on the right. In the twentieth century, artists began to play with perspective by drawing \\"impossible objects\\". These objects included stairs that always ascend, or cubes where the back meets the front. Such works were popularized by the artist M. C. Escher and the mathematician Roger Penrose. Although referred to as \\"impossible objects\\", such objects as the Necker Cube and the Penrose triangle can be sculpted in 3-D by using anamorphic illusion. When viewed at a certain angle, such sculptures appear as the so-called impossible objects. Ames rooms Ames room forced perspective Ames room The Ames room was invented by American scientist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1946. When viewed through a peephole, the room appears to have normal perspective. However, all other viewpoints reveal that the room is constructed of irregular trapezoids. Similar effects had been achieved during the Renaissance through the use of \\"accelerated perspective\\" in stage design. These included productions by Scamozzi (1588-9), Furtenbach (1625), Sabbattini (1637) and Troili (1672). One of the most interesting effects of an Ames room is that the distorted perspective can make people and objects look much bigger or smaller than they really are. For this reason, Ames rooms are widely used in cinema for practical special effects. A well-known example is the homes in the Shire from the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films. Through the use of forced perspective, the character of Gandalf appeared much larger than the characters of Frodo and Bilbo, without the use of digital effects. Practical uses Cinemascope, Panavision, Technirama, and other widescreen formats use anamorphosis to project a wider image from a narrower film frame. The IMAX company uses even more extreme anamorphic transformations to project moving images from a flat film frame onto the inside of a hemispheric dome, in its \\"Omnimax\\" or \\"IMAX Dome\\" process. The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very flat angle on roadways, such as \\"Bus Lane\\" or \\"Children Crossing\\", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen. Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in Rugby football in Australia, it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play. Much writing on shop windows is in principle anamorphic, as it was written mirror- reversed on the inside of the window glass.

In the work of contemporary artists Anamorphic street art by Manfred Stader While not as widespread in contemporary art, anamorphosis as a technique has been used by contemporary artists in painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, film and video, digital art and games, holography, street art and installation. The latter two art forms are largely practised in public areas such as parks, city centres and transit stations. In 1975 a major exhibition was held focusing exclusively on anamorphic imagery: Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art. The artist Jan Beutener created The Room, a major new installation specifically for the exhibit. =Sculpture and Installation= Anamorphic mosaic art Since the mid-20th century, many artists have made use of anamorphosis in public artworks. American Land art pioneer Michael Heizer's Complex One (1972-1974), a massive earth and concrete structure in the Nevada desert, creates a rectangular frame for a mastaba when viewed from a specific location. Inspired by Luxor and other ancient monumental sites, it is part of the larger work City, an enormous sculpture running a mile and a half long. The entire work will not be completed until 2020. Shigeo Fukuda, a Japanese artist and designer globally renowned for his satirical posters on anti-war and environmental advocacy, created posters and sculptures making use of both types of anamorphosis in the 1970s and 1980s. He also wrote multiple books on the topic of optical illusions. Felici Varini's 2014 work Three Ellipses for Three Locks in Hasselt, Belgium is an image of three loops that are made up of segments painted on to over 100 buildings. It is only visible from a specific vantage point over the city. Jean-Max Albert, Un carré pour un square, from the specific vantage point, Place Fréhel, Paris(1988) French artists that have created recent anamorphic installations include François Abélanet and Jean-Max Albert. Marcus Raetz's Kopf is a large scale public installation that reveals the form of a person's head in profile when viewed from a specific vantage- point. It was installed in a public park in Basel, Switzerland. While anamorphic images were not his exclusive area of focus, the American artist Jonathan Borofsky created installations in the 1980s using anamorphic techniques, exhibiting at institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art. Jonty Hurwitz, pioneered the use of a mathematical technique to create Catoptric sculptures that resolve in a cylinder. In 2013 he produced a public work for the Savoy Hotel's River Room. =Drawing and Painting= The Swedish artist Hans Hamngren produced and exhibited many examples of mirror anamorphosis in the 1960s and 1970s. Sara Willet's paintings focus on anamorphic images. =Photography= Beginning in 1967, Dutch artist Jan Dibbets based an entire series of photographic work titled Perspective Corrections on the distortion of reality through perspective anamorphosis. This involved the incorporation of land art into his work, where areas dug out of the Earth formed squares from specific perspectives. =Street Art= Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called \\"Slant Art\\" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the sidewalk chalk drawings of Kurt Wenner and Julian Beever, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time. In 2016, the street artist JR completed a massive temporary anamorphic illusion over the Louvre's pyramid, making the modern structure disappear and the original building appear as though it was still in the 17th century.

It has been used for children's toys, album art, advertising, videogames and movies, among other things. In the 1970s, albums for musicians Steeleye Span and Rick Wakeman featured anamorphic album art. The 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum has a series of riddles posed by the classic Batman antagonist The Riddler, the solution of which is based on perspective anamorphosis. In 2013, Honda released a commercial which incorporated a series of illusions based on anamorphosis.

Since their foundation in 1984, the band has released six studio albums and numerous singles. Their most recent album, 2016's Faces to the Sun, was more than four years in the making.  History  Formation = Mango Groove formed in Johannesburg in 1984. Three of the four founding members—John Leyden, Andy Craggs, and Bertrand Mouton—were bandmates in a \\"white middle-class punk band\\" called Pett Frog, while they were students at the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1984 the three young men met kwela musician \\"Big Voice\\" Jack Lerole at the Gallo Records building in Johannesburg. In the late 1950s, Lerole had led a kwela band called Elias and His Zig-Zag Jive Flutes. John Leyden was enamoured with South African jazz of this era. Lerole's reputation preceded him. He and the boys from Pett Frog rehearsed together, and a new band started to take shape.\\"The Space In-Between.\\" The Essential Mango Groove. (2008) The band's name was invented over dinner: a pun on the phrase \\"Man, go groove!\\".Shaw, p. 86 = Evolution = In Mango Groove's early days, musicians came and went as the group evolved into a cohesive whole.Shaw (1991) Leyden was the only founding member who has stayed on since the very beginning, but the full roster eventually swelled to 11 members. Alan Lazar, a composer and arranger who became the band's keyboardist, explains that a big band with diverse musical elements allows for a variety of arrangements.Shaw (1991) For most of the band's history, it has comprised four vocalists, lead and bass guitar, a brass section, drums, keyboards, and the penny whistle. (The penny whistle is the central instrument in kwela music—a Southern African style that has strongly influenced Mango Groove's sound.) Lead singer Claire Johnston's soprano is complemented by backing vocalists Beulah Hashe, Marilyn Nokwe, and Phumzile Ntuli. Guitarist and longtime member George Lewis joined in 1984. He, John Leyden, Kevin Botha, Jack Lerole, and Simon \\"Mahlathini\\" Nkabinde co- wrote \\"Dance Some More\\", which was the first song Mango Groove recorded.\\"CD 2\\". The Essential Mango Groove (2008). Track listing. The band had not yet found their singers, and this seminal recording was fronted by Jack Lerole and the Mahotella Queens. Johnston joined when she was 17. She was receiving voice instruction from Eve Boswell at the time. Bertrand Moulton called Boswell in 1984 and asked her to refer her best female singer, and she recommended Claire Johnston. Leyden met Johnston for the first time in Rosebank, a suburb of Johannesburg. She played him some tapes of her singing, and went to see the band perform. \\"I was intrigued because I'd never heard anything like Mango Groove.\\" After a month with no word from the band, Johnston received a phone call from Leyden who asked if she could rehearse for a show booked two nights later.702 Unplugged with Mango Groove. Event occurs at 1:29. When Johnston graduated from secondary school, she—like Leyden, Craggs, and Moulton before her—enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand. She completed a Bachelor of Arts degree while touring with the band. She and John Leyden married in 1999, and divorced more than a decade later.702 Unplugged with Mango Groove. Event occurs at 6:21.Moses, p. 137 The band's first studio recording with Claire Johnston was \\"Two Hearts\\", which they released as a single in 1985. The band at this time had seven members: John Leyden (bass guitar), Sarah Pontin (alto sax and clarinet), Banza Kgasoane (trumpet), Mickey Vilakazi (trombone), Sipho Bhengu (tenor sax), and George Lewis (guitar). On the back of the record jacket was a sales pitch introducing potential listeners to the band and their ethos. Nicholas Hauser, who wrote the copy, described \\"Two Hearts\\" as a \\"beatbox township waltz\\" that blends music of different traditions. The band's first hit came in 1987: \\"Move Up\\", which was released on 7-inch record in an edition of 4,000, reached number one on the Capital Radio hitparade. Some of the band's other former members are drummer Peter Cohen, trumpeter Banza Kgasoane, composer/keyboardist Alan Lazar, penny whistler Kelly Petlane, keyboardist Les Blumberg, and trombonist Mickey Vilakazi. Before his stint with Mango Groove, Cohen co-founded the South African pop rock band Bright Blue; he later joined Freshlyground (est. 2003), a six-person fusion ensemble that has been compared with Mango Groove.Mojapelo, p. 127 Alto saxophonist and clarinetist Sarah Pontin left the band in 1986. Mduduzi Magwaza eventually took her place on the alto saxophone; he also plays the penny whistle. Alan Lazar joined on as Mango Groove's keyboardist not long after the band's formation. He co-wrote some of their first songs, including the 1985 single \\"Two Hearts\\". In the mid-1990s he started producing scores for film and television, and won a scholarship from the United States' Fulbright Foreign Student Program. After earning a Master of Fine Arts degree from the USC School of Cinema-Television in 1997, he settled in the US and continued his career in the Greater Los Angeles Area. \\"Big Mickey\\" Vilakazi, a World War II veteran, was also an early member of the band. He was 65 when he joined; John Leyden recalled that when Vilakazi died in June 1988, it seemed for a time that the band might break up.Shaw, p. 1 Mango's longtime trumpeter, Banza Kgasoane, died 9 December 2015, age 65. At the funeral service in Alexandra, Claire Johnston, John Leyden, and other musicians joined Kgasoane's son Moshe on-stage to perform a tribute to Banza. Moshe, like his father, took up the trumpet; he performs as Mo-T with the band Mi Casa. On 21 December, South Africa's Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa memorialised Kgasoane in a press statement issued by the Department. = Albums = In July 1989, a year after Mickey Vilakazi's death, the band released their first studio album: Mango Groove. Four of the album's eleven songs had previously been released as singles: \\"Two Hearts\\" in 1985, \\"Love Is (the Hardest Part)\\" in 1986, and \\"Do You Dream of Me?\\" and \\"Move Up\\" in 1987. After the album's release, three more songs were released as singles: \\"Hellfire\\", \\"Dance Sum More\\", and \\"Special Star\\". Mango's debut album stayed in the top 20 of the Radio Orion national album chart for a year, and peaked at number 2. This was the longest that any album had maintained such a rank on Orion's chart. However, when Phil Collins released …But Seriously a few months later—an album that had some anti-apartheid themes—it demonstrated a similar staying power. (Radio Orion itself was a national FM radio station operated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation. It operated only at night, with a format that included \\"a wide variety of music, phone-in shows and topical discussion.\\") Mango Groove was followed by Hometalk in 1990, Another Country in 1993, and Eat a Mango in 1995. In South Africa, each of these was released by Tusk Music—or by its One World Entertainment imprint. Hometalk went gold as soon as it was released in South Africa (it has since reached platinum status). After Eat a Mango, the band released several compilation album, but they did not put out another studio album until Bang the Drum in 2009. \\"We took a break,\\" Claire Johnston told an interviewer shortly after Bang the Drums release. \\"I wanted to do some solo things and get some of those frustrations and aspirations out of my system.… We just put Mango Groove on the back burner.… [W]e all did our own things, while still getting back together for the odd Mango Groove concert.\\" In a 2014 interview, Johnston elaborated: \\"We experienced a creative lull. It happens to everyone; and I really learned a lot about myself during that time. I joined Mango Groove at such a young age, I needed to go out on my own and explore…\\". During this period, Johnston released her first solo album, Fearless (2001), and a cover album called Africa Blue (2004). She also recorded the song \\"Together as One (Kanye Kanye)\\" with Jeff Maluleke in 2003; John Leyden was the producer.\\"Together as One (Kanye Kanye)\\" was the official song of the South African Rugby Union in 2003. Johnston and Maluleke later recorded an album together: Starehe: An African Day (2006), and Leyden produced albums for other artists. Sax and penny whistle player Mduduzi \\"Duzi\\" Magwaza also released an album, Boerekwela (2005), and accompanied the Soweto String Quartet on their world tour.The title Boerekwela, which translates as \\"peasant kwela\\", is a bit of wordplay that alludes to the Afrikaans folk music genre boeremusiek. An impetus for Mango Groove to record together again came after the band launched their website in 2007: Fans kept asking when they would release a new album.Moses, p. 136 After Bang the Drum came the DVD Mango Groove: Live in Concert (2011), but it was not until 2016 that the band released a new studio album: Faces to the Sun, a double album that took more than four years to write, record, and produce. \\"We don't churn out albums,\\" said Leyden in 2015, when Faces to the Sun was still in production. \\"Mango is a lot of people and we have different creative projects that we've done over the years.… [We've had] long hiatuses, but Mango has never stopped going.\\" Between 1989 and 2009, the band sold more than 700,000 albums in South Africa; that number eventually surpassed one million.  Multi-ethnicity  For the band's first seven years, the National Party was in power, and apartheid was an official policy of the government of South Africa. For a band with white and black members, the government's policies of enforced racial segregation made accommodations, booking, and travel more difficult, if not dangerous. Sometimes when they arrived at a club to perform, they were refused entry because they were multi- ethnic. On one occasion, John Leyden (a white man) was arrested on a charge of loitering after he gave a ride home to bandmate Jack Lerole (a black man). At the same time, the state was trying to censor and suppress the anti- establishment music scene. In the 1980s and early 1990s, near the end of the apartheid era, Mango Groove and Juluka were the only major South African music groups with both black and white band-members. In the early 1990s Mango Groove was managed by Roddy Quin (with Run-Run Artist Management), who was also the manager for Johnny Clegg of Juluka.Mojapelo, pp. 123, 127 The two bands became emblematic of the rainbow nation envisioned by Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela. When Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison on 11 February 1990 after 27 years of imprisonment, the US news program Nightline used \\"We Are Waiting\\" as a musical score for the event. Band members had written the song in anticipation of Mandela's release. The number of US viewers who watched the broadcast was estimated at 30 million. In 1994 the band were invited to play for Mandela's inauguration concert, to a crowd of about 100,000 people. This was the country's first inauguration of a president elected by both black and white voters. \\"We weren't overtly political,\\" lead singer Claire Johnston said in 2017. \\"The only song that was was 'Another Country'. But we changed the hearts and minds of people in a way politicians cannot.\\"  Performances  In South Africa = Lead singer Claire Johnston on-stage for a concert at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden on New Year's Day, 2012 Mango Groove have appeared at numerous venues and music festivals in their home country of South Africa. In a 2015 interview, John Leyden expressed a need to limit the number of live shows Mango Groove per year in order to avoid overexposure in a small country like South Africa. \\"We have never stopped performing but we are very selective of the shows we do.… The essence of Mango Groove is… the live show.\\" Early in their career, the band played six sold-out shows at the Sun City Superbowl at Sun City, North West, and six more at the Standard Bank Arena in Johannesburg. After the release of Hometalk in November 1990, the band and six dancers toured South Africa and the Frontline States from December 1990 to January 1991. (A concert video was also released.) Prior to the release of their third album, 1993's Another Country, they played an open-air concert with the National Symphony Orchestra of South Africa in an amphitheatre in Johannesburg. Mango performed at the Innibos music festival in July 2009, and released their fifth studio album, Bang the Drum, the following September. In 2010 they began a national tour of South Africa, with the possibility of stops in other parts of Africa, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain. This was a comeback tour, as Bang the Drum was the first studio album the band had released since 1995's Eat a Mango. The Big World Party Tour, as it was called, was named from the lyrics of \\"Give It\\", a song written by John Leyden and Claire Johnston for the album: The tour began on 5 April 2010 in Port Elizabeth, where they gave the final musical performance of the MTN Nelson Mandela Bay Splash Festival. On 17 April they appeared at the Emmarentia Dam and Johannesburg Botanical Gardens, accompanied by supporting acts Josie Field and Wrestlerish. That same weekend they did a show at Spier Gardens in Stellenbosch. They have since performed at the music festivals Oppikoppi (2013), Splashy Fen (2016), and Park Acoustics (2013 and 2016). On New Year's Day 2012 and 2017, they performed at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden for the garden's Summer Sunset Concert series. = Abroad = When talks following the South African Border War culminated in independence for Namibia in March 1990, the band were invited to perform at Namibia's celebration concert. The event took place at Independence Stadium in Windhoek the Saturday after Namibian independence day; Namibian and South African bands played to nearly 20,000 people. In 1994 they played in Namibia again in celebration of the integration of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands into Namibia. (Namibia's cessation from South Africa did not originally include these territories. South Africa finally ceded them on 1 March 1994.) The Walvis Bay integration concert was the first time Mango Groove performed \\"Let Your Heart Speak\\" to a live audience. They did not play in Namibia again until 1998, when they preceded their South African tour with a show at the Windhoek Country Club. Mango's first overseas show was an anti-racism concert in Paris, 1990—the latest in an annual series that had begun in 1985. The concerts' organisers (Julian Drey et al. of SOS-Racisme) were inspired by the concert launched by Rock Against Racism in London, 1978. At the Paris concert, Mango Groove played to an audience of 200,000 people. That same year the band toured Australia for the first time. The Australian shows were followed by a performance in Hong Kong, where the Hong Kong Ballet danced to \\"Special Star\\". After a tour of South Africa and the Frontline States ended in January 1991, the band travelled to Great Britain for the Live in London tour. There they appeared at the Hammersmith Apollo and other Greater London venues. On 20 April 1992, they performed, via live satellite uplink from South Africa, for the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in London, to a television audience estimated at one billion people. In July 1992 their show at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland met with such an enthusiastic response, they came back onstage for three encores. In 1997 they played at the Celebrate Hong Kong Reunification concert that followed the Hong Kong handover ceremony. After their 1998 tour of South Africa, the band planned to tour Germany in August and, later, the US. They toured Australia in the mid-1990s, and have also performed in Canada and Zimbabwe. A 2014 tour of Australia and New Zealand was cancelled when the tour promoter, Mzungu Promotions, lost a major source of funds (for reasons unrelated to the tour). Originally, the tour was to include six shows from 21 February to 4 March, beginning with Red Hill Auditorium in Perth; then on to the Forum Theatre in Melbourne; Bruce Mason Centre in Auckland; Big Top Sydney at Luna Park Sydney; Eatons Hill Hotel in Brisbane; and concluding at Norwood Concert Hall in Adelaide. Days before the tour was to begin, it was postponed to May and June, and supplemented with a planned stop in Dunedin. The Perth venue changed from Red Hill Auditorium to the Metro City Concert Club, and the Adelaide venue changed from the Norwood Concert Hall to HQ. Nevertheless, a press release issued in mid-May announced the cancellation of the entire tour. On 7 March 2015, the band returned to the Hammersmith Apollo in London for the first time in more than 20 years. The opening act was South African singer- songwriter Matthew Mole. Claire Johnston had done a solo show at the Apollo in 2014, which cultivated demand for a Mango concert.  Awards  The South African Broadcasting Corporation awarded Mango Groove five OKTV awards during the band's early years: The debut album, Mango Groove, won in the categories of \\"Best Album\\" and \\"Best Arranger\\"; one of the singles won \\"Best Video\\". In 1991, Hometalk won \\"Best Pop Album\\", and one of its singles won \\"Hit of the Year\\". The OKTV Awards were an annual event in which members of the South African media were the judges. At the second annual South African Music Awards in 1996, the album Eat a Mango won a SAMA in the category \\"Best Adult Contemporary Performance: English\\". In 2017, the band's seventh studio album, Faces to the Sun, was nominated in the \\"Best Adult Contemporary Album\\" and \\"Best Engineered Album\\" categories (the engineer was bandmember Andrew Baird). The award for \\"Best Adult Contemporary Album\\" went to Hugh Masekela's No Borders; the award for Best Engineered Album went to Arno Carstens' Aandblom 13. Other nominees in the Adult Contemporary Album category that year were Elvis Blue's Optics, Majozi's Fire, and Msaki's Zaneliza: How the Water Moves.

Families living along the Sepik Coast in northern Papua New Guinea form alliances with families in other communities. Depending on the importance and status of the family, it can have anywhere between 5 and 75 contacts in its social network. In each surrounding town, the family knows another. When they travel to another town, they bring gifts to their contact family, and that family will house and care for them. Gifts are reciprocated when given or later when families return the visit. Common gifts are sago, tobacco, baskets, wooden bowls, and other similar items. The recipient does not specify which type of gift they would like to receive, but as a result of the vast quantity of exchanges taking place, the needs of participants are generally met. A social field is one in which all the members have similar expectations of each other. In the social networks of the Sepik Coast, the significant expectations are hospitality, gift giving and reciprocation from friends in different villages. Alliances are passed along and preserved through many generations, because fathers bring their sons on their trips and families honor an association, no matter how long it has been since the last gift exchange.

He was the first to document the deliberate addition of sugar for the production of sparkling wine, and produced the first lists of British birds and butterflies. Life Merret was born in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire on 16 February; Hunter gives the year of his birth as 1615, which may be 1614 Old Style. In 1632 he went up to Gloucester Hall, Oxford (which later became Worcester College); he received his BA from Oriel in 1635, and his BMed and DMed from Gloucester Hall in 1636 and 1643 respectively. Merret then practised medicine in London, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1651. Three years later he moved to the RCP's premises at Amen Corner near St Paul's Cathedral, as the first Harveian Librarian, for which he received room and board and a small stipend. But disaster struck in 1666 with the Great fire of London, which destroyed many of the rooms and most of the books. The college felt that he was no longer needed, but he felt that he had been appointed for life and fought them before the King's Bench twice, losing both times. He was expelled from his rooms and lost his Fellowship. He was a founding Fellow of the Royal Society, joining May 20, 1663.Complete List of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007 in pdf format He became the chairman of the Royal Society's committee concerned with the history of trade and commerce,Koinm, AJ (2000) Christopher Merret's Use of Experiment Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 54 (1), 23–32 (2000) but was expelled in 1685. He died at his home near the chapel in Hatton Garden, on 19 August 1695, and was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn. Naturalist Merret collected new plants, maintained a herb garden and compiled one of the first lists of the flora, fauna and minerals of England, the Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum. The Pinax was published in 1666 and is an alphabetical catalogue with no explanatory commentary. However it represents the first lists of British birds and butterflies, and contains one of the first statements by an Englishman on the organic origin of fossils: Metallurgy and glass making Merret had a particular interest in industrial uses of minerals, publishing papers on smelting and tin mining. In 1662 he translated Antonio Neri’s The Art of Glass (1611) and added 147 pages of his own, from other authors and his own observations. His descriptions of glassmaking indicate an intimate familiarity with the process, but his modern claim to fame lies in a passing mention to a different field altogether. On 17 December 1662 he presented Some Observations concerning the Ordering of Wines to the Royal Society. In this paper, unearthed by wine writer Tom Stevenson, Merret describes winemakers adding quantities of sugar and molasses to make the wines drink brisk and sparkling.Mountain, Donna (2005) Sounds of Summer: English wine, a quiet revolution Transcript of ABC radio programme. Today this would be called the méthode champenoise, the addition of liqueur de tirage in order to stimulate a secondary fermentation that produces the bubbles in sparkling wine. Spontaneous secondary fermentation had occurred in still wines since antiquity; most glass bottles of the time were not strong enough to contain the high pressures thus generated and so exploding bottles were an occupational hazard of winemaking. Sir Robert Mansell obtained a monopoly on glass production in England in the early 17th century and industrialised the process; his coal-powered factories in Newcastle upon Tyne produced much stronger bottles than were available in France. As a result, the English could deliberately induce a secondary fermentation in wine without the risk of blowing up the bottle, long before Dom Pérignon is traditionally considered to have invented sparkling wine in Champagne around 1697. Although Merret appears to have been more interested in making glass than in making wine, producers of English sparkling wine such as Ridgeview have been quick to use his name as a generic term to describe their wines.

The mission was formally abandoned in July 2008 after experiencing serious difficulties in sustaining its troops due to fuel stoppages and after due consideration of remaining options. History On July 31, 2000, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1312 and established UNMEE. The mission was put in place in order to formally demarcate the border between the two countries. The border followed the route as declared by an international commission in The Hague but Ethiopia refused to accept the ruling, despite originally agreeing to binding arbitration. The mission maintained headquarters in Asmara (Eritrea), and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), and consisted of 1,676 military personnel, amid high tensions between the two countries. About 1,500 of these peacekeepers were from the Indian Army. In addition, there were about 147 international civilians, 202 local civilians and 67 UN Volunteers. Their area of responsibility was a buffer zone 25 kilometers (15 miles) wide on the Eritrean side of the Ethiopian-Eritrean border. There have been recorded 20 fatalities: 13 military personnel, 3 international civilian personnel and 4 local civilian personnel. The approved budget for the mission between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2008 was $118.99 million. The border between Ethiopia and Eritrea has remained closed and thousands of people live in refugee camps while perhaps a million people remain displaced. In October 2005, the Eritrean government restricted UNMEE helicopter flights along the border and demanded the reduction of the UNMEE force by 300 staffers. Eritrea also restricted movement of ground patrols inside the buffer zone. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1640 in November 2005 threatened sanctions on both parties if there was no resolution. In September 2007, United Nations special envoy to the Horn of Africa, Kjell Magne Bondevik, warned that war could resume between Ethiopia and Eritrea over their border conflict. In November, Eritrea accepted the border line demarcated by the international boundary commission, which was rejected by Ethiopia. In January 2008 the UN extended the mandate of peacekeepers on Ethiopia-Eritrea border for six months, and UN Security Council demanded Eritrea lift fuel restrictions imposed on UN peacekeepers at the Eritrea- Ethiopia border area. Eritrea declined, saying troops must leave border, and in February the UN began pulling out the 1,700-strong peacekeeper force due to lack of fuel supplies following Eritrean government restrictions. In April, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon warned of the likelihood of new war between Ethiopia and Eritrea if peacekeeping mission is withdrawn completely, and outlines options for the future of the UN mission in the two countries. In May, Eritrea called on UN to terminate the peacekeeping mission., BBC News, 19 June 2008 The mission was ended with effect from 31 July 2008 with a UNSC resolution adopted on 30 July 2008. Peacekeepers had been driven from the border zone by Eritrea by February 2008, and Ethiopia had refused to accept a binding International Court of Justice ruling on the border issue. There are fears that this may set a precedent to show that a country can force out UN peacekeepers. Analysts also fear a new war may erupt between Ethiopia and Eritrea over the border dispute. Eritrea has, however, tried to allay fears over a new war. Staff and forces On 30 November 2007, UNMEE had a total of 1,676 military personnel, including 1,464 troops and 212 military observers, supported by 147 international civilians, 202 local civilians and 67 UN Volunteers. *Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of Mission:Azouz Ennifar () *Deputy Special Representatives: *Force Commander: Major-General Mohammad Taisir Masadeh () Contributors of military personnel: ;Africa   Nigeria * South Africa  ;Americas   * * ;Asia  * * Kyrgyzstan  * * ;Europe        See also * Eritrean-Ethiopian War ReferencesExternal links * UN UNMEE mission page * Mission homepage Category:Eritrea–Ethiopia relations Ethiopia and Eritrea 1312 Category:Military operations involving India Category:Territorial disputes of Eritrea Category:Territorial disputes of Ethiopia Category:Ethiopia and the United Nations Category:Eritrea and the United Nations ","title":"United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea"},{"id":"2489538","text":"Rowlands Castle railway station serves the village of Rowland's Castle, Hampshire, England.

This portrait showcases both the imperial majesty of Elizabeth I, in allegorical figures of the foreground, and the English defeat of the Spanish Armada, with its naval backdrop. Elizabethan literature refers to bodies of work produced during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), and is one of the most splendid ages of English literature.. Elizabeth I presided over a vigorous culture that saw notable accomplishments in the arts, voyages of discovery, the \\"Elizabethan Settlement\\" that created the Church of England, and the defeat of military threats from Spain.. During her reign a London-centred culture, both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. English playwrights combined the influence of the Medieval theatre with the Renaissance's rediscovery of the Roman dramatists, Seneca, for tragedy, and Plautus and Terence, for comedy. Italy was an important source for Renaissance ideas in England and the linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, who had furthermore brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He also translated the works of Montaigne from French into English.Frances A. Yates, The life of an Italian in Shakespeare’s England. Prose Two of the most important Elizabethan prose writers were John Lyly (1553 or 1554 – 1606) and Thomas Nashe (November 1567 – c. 1601). Lyly is an English writer, poet, dramatist, playwright, and politician, best known for his books Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit (1578) and Euphues and His England (1580). Lyly's mannered literary style, originating in his first books, is known as euphuism. Lyly must also be considered and remembered as a primary influence on the plays of William Shakespeare, and in particular the romantic comedies. Lyly's play Love's Metamorphosis is a large influence on Love's Labour's Lost,Kerrigan, J. ed. \\"Love's Labours Lost\\", New Penguin Shakespeare, Harmondsworth 1982, ; and Gallathea is a possible source for other plays.\\"John Lilly and Shakespeare\\", by C. C. Hense in the Jahrbuch der deutschen Shakesp. Gesellschaft, vols. vii and viii (1872, 1873). Nash is considered the greatest of the English Elizabethan pamphleteers. He was a playwright, poet, and satirist, who is best known for his novel The Unfortunate Traveller. George Puttenham (1529–1590) was a 16th-century English writer and literary critic. He is generally considered to be the author of the influential handbook on poetry and rhetoric, The Arte of English Poesie (1589). Poetry The epic poem The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser; titlepage, printed for William Ponsonby in 1590 Italian literature was an important influence on the poetry of Thomas Wyatt (1503–42), one of the earliest English Renaissance poets. He was responsible for many innovations in English poetry, and alongside Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1516/1517–47) introduced the sonnet from Italy into England in the early 16th century. Wyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English tongue, to civilise it, to raise its powers to those of its neighbours. While a significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the Italian poet Petrarch, he also wrote sonnets of his own. Wyatt took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \\"octave\\", rhyming abba abba, followed, after a turn (volta) in the sense, by a sestet with various rhyme schemes, however his poems never ended in a rhyming couplet. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee. This marks the beginnings of English sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet.The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, p. 647 In the later 16th century, English poetry was characterised by elaboration of language and extensive allusion to classical myths. The most important poets of this era include Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney. Elizabeth herself, a product of Renaissance humanism, produced occasional poems such as On Monsieur’s Departure and The Doubt of Future Foes. Edmund Spenser (c. 1552–99) was one of the most important poets of this period, author of The Faerie Queene (1590 and 1596), an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. Another major figure, Sir Philip Sidney (1554–86), was an English poet, courtier and soldier, and is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the Elizabethan Age. His works include Astrophel and Stella, The Defence of Poetry, and The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as by Thomas Campion (1567–1620), became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. See English Madrigal School. Shakespeare also popularized the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch's model. =Changes to the canon= While the canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th has always been in some form of flux, it is only towards the late 20th century that concerted efforts were made to challenge the canon. Questions that once did not even have to be made, such as where to put the limitations of periods, what geographical areas to include, what genres to include, what writers and what kinds of writers to include, are now central. The central figures of the Elizabethan canon are Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson. There have been few attempts to change this long established list because the cultural importance of these five is so great that even re-evaluations on grounds of literary merit has not dared to dislodge them from the curriculum. Edmund Spenser had a significant influences on 17th-century poetry. Spenser was the primary English influence on John Milton. In the 18th century interest in Elizabethan poetry was rekindled through the scholarship of Thomas Warton and others. The Lake Poets and other Romantics, at the beginning of the 19th century, were well-read in Renaissance poetry. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed only in the Victorian period, with anthologies like Palgrave's Golden Treasury. A fairly representative idea of the \\"Victorian canon\\" is also given by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of English Verse (1919). The poems from this period are largely songs and apart from the major names, one sees the two pioneers Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey, and a scattering of poems by other writers of the period. However, the authors of many poems are anonymous. Some poems, such as Thomas Sackville's Induction to the Mirror for Magistrates, were highly regarded (and therefore \\"in the canon\\") but they were omitted from the anthology as non-lyric. In the 20th century T. S. Eliot's many essays on Elizabethan subjects were mainly concerned with Elizabethan theatre, but he also attempted to bring back long-forgotten poets to general attention, like Sir John Davies, whose cause he championed in an article in The Times Literary Supplement in 1926 (republished in On Poetry and Poets, 1957). The American critic Yvor Winters suggested in 1939, an alternative canon of Elizabethan poetry.Poetry, LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967. In this canon he excludes the famous representatives of the Petrarchan school of poetry, represented by Sir Philip Sidney and Edmund Spenser, and instead turns his eye to a Native or Plain Style anti- Petrarchan movement, which he claims has been overlooked and undervalued. The most underrated member of this movement he deems to have been George Gascoigne (1525–1577), who \\"deserves to be ranked...among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher\\".Poetry, LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 98 Other members were Sir Walter Raleigh Characteristic of this movement is that a poem has ::a theme usually broad, simple, and obvious, even tending toward the proverbial, but usually a theme of some importance, humanly speaking; a feeling restrained to the minimum required by the subject; a rhetoric restrained to a similar minimum, the poet being interested in his rhetoric as a means of stating his matter as economically as possible, and not, as are the Petrarchans, in the pleasures of rhetoric for its own sake. There is also in the school a strong tendency towards aphoristic statement.Poetry, LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 95 Both Eliot and Winters were very much in favour of the established canon. Towards the end of the 20th century, however, the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers. Theatre The Italian Renaissance had rediscovered the ancient Greek and Roman theatre. This revival of interest was instrumental in the development of the new drama, which was then beginning to make apart from the old mystery and miracle plays of the Middle Ages. The Italians were inspired by Seneca (a major tragic playwright and philosopher, the tutor of Nero) and by Plautus (whose comic clichés, especially that of the boasting soldier, had a powerful influence during the Renaissance and thereafter). However, the Italian tragedies embraced a principle contrary to Seneca's ethics: showing blood and violence on the stage. In Seneca's plays such scenes were only acted by the characters. A 1596 sketch of a rehearsal in progress on the thrust stage of The Swan, a typical circular Elizabethan open-roof playhouse. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and then James I (1603–25), in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a London-centred culture, that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by the Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include Gorboduc (1561), by Sackville and Norton, and Thomas Kyd's (1558–94) revenge tragedy The Spanish Tragedy (1592). Highly popular and influential in its time, The Spanish Tragedy established a new genre in English literature theatre, the revenge play or revenge tragedy. Its plot contains several violent murders and includes as one of its characters a personification of Revenge. The Spanish Tragedy was often referred to, or parodied, in works written by other Elizabethan playwrights, including William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and Christopher Marlowe. Many elements of The Spanish Tragedy, such as the play- within-a-play used to trap a murderer and a ghost intent on vengeance, appear in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical Ur-Hamlet that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for Hamlet. Jane Lumley (1537–1578) was the first person to translate Euripides into English. Her translation of Iphigeneia at Aulis is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English.Buck, Claire, ed. \\"Lumley, Joanna Fitzalan (c. 1537–1576/77).\\" The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature. New York: Prentice Hall, 1992. 764. William Shakespeare (1564–1616) stands out in this period both as a poet and playwright. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including histories, tragedies, comedies and the late romances, or tragicomedies. His early classical and Italianate comedies, like A Comedy of Errors, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies,. A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night. After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, and Julius Caesar, based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, which introduced a new kind of drama.; . Shakespeare's career continued into the Jacobean period, and in the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called \\"problem plays\\", Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well, as well as a number of his best known tragedies, including Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear and Anthony and Cleopatra.; . The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher. Other important figures in the Elizabethan theatre include Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Dekker. Marlowe's (1564–1593) subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the Renaissance man than any other thing. Drawing on German folklore, Marlowe introduced the story of Faust to England in his play Doctor Faustus (c. 1592), about a scientist and magician who, obsessed by the thirst of knowledge and the desire to push man's technological power to its limits, sells his soul to the Devil. Faustus makes use of \\"the dramatic framework of the morality plays in its presentation of a story of temptation, fall, and damnation, and its free use of morality figures such as the good angel and the bad angel and the seven deadly sins, along with the devils Lucifer and Mephistopheles.\\"\\"Christopher Marlowe.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 6 April 2013. . Thomas Dekker (c. 1570–1632) was, between 1598 and 1602, involved in about forty plays, usually in collaboration. He is particularly remembered for The Shoemaker's Holiday (1599), a work where he appears to be the sole author. Dekker is noted for his \\"realistic portrayal of daily London life and for \\"his sympathy for the poor and oppressed\\".The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), pp. 266–7. Robert Greene (c. 1558–1592) was another popular dramatist but he is now best known for a posthumous pamphlet attributed to him, Greenes, Groats-worth of Witte, bought with a million of Repentance, widely believed to contain an attack on William Shakespeare.

One of his well-known epic poems is Lilit Taleng Phai. In 1851 he was appointed the Supreme Patriarch of the Rattanakosin kingdom and remained in that position until his death. Life Prince Wasukri () was a child of King Rama I and Lady Chui (), born at the Grand Palace he was the king's twenty-eight child. In 1802, he became a Samanera or novice monk at the age of 12 years old, eight years later he was ordained a Bhikkhu monk. As a monk he resided at Wat Pho and studied to become a religious scholar there. He was also learned in the Khmer and Pali languages. Two years later he was made the abbot of the temple. King Rama III, who was his nephew, frequently called upon him to write, translate, and compile books. During his reign the king gave his uncle the ecclesiastical rank equivalent to that of a deputy patriarch, in which he was put in charge of all the temples within Bangkok. The prince abbot was also a prolific poet and composed many religious and sacred verses. Many of these verse were made into inscriptions which can be found all over Wat Pho today, making the temple a place of worship and a place of learning. In 1851, the new monarch, King Rama IV, appointed the abbot as the Supreme Patriarch of the kingdom, and he was given the official title Somdet Phra Maha Samana Chao Krom Phra Paramanuchitchinorot. Unfortunately, this honour was briefly held, as he died on 9 December 1853. His body lay in state for a full year before his cremation.

Based on a 1966 Esquire short story \\"The Day It All Happened, Baby!\\" by Robert Thom, it was distributed by American International Pictures. The film, described as both \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"cautionary\\", was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing and became a cult classic of the 1960s counterculture. Plot Popular rock singer and aspiring revolutionary Max Frost (Christopher Jones) was born Max Jacob Flatow Jr. His first public act of violence was blowing up his family's new car. Frost's band, the Troopers, live together with him, their women, and others, in a sprawling Beverly Hills mansion. The band includes his 15-year-old genius attorney Billy Cage (Kevin Coughlin) on lead guitar, ex-child actor and girlfriend Sally LeRoy (Diane Varsi) on keyboards, hook-handed Abraham Salteen (Larry Bishop) on bass guitar and trumpet, and anthropologist Stanley X (Richard Pryor) on drums. Max's band performs a song noting that 52 percent of the population is 25 or younger, making young people the majority in the country. When Max is asked to sing at a televised political rally by Kennedyesque Senate candidate Johnny Fergus (Hal Holbrook), who is running on a platform to lower the voting age from 21 to 18, he and the Troopers appear – but Max stuns everyone by calling instead for the voting age to become 14, then finishes the show with an improvised song, \\"Fourteen or Fight!\\", and a call for a demonstration. Max's fans – and other young people, by the thousands – stir to action, and within 24 hours protests have begun in cities around the United States. Fergus's advisors want him to denounce Max, but instead he agrees to support the demonstrations, and change his campaign – if Max and his group will compromise, accept a voting age of 15 instead, abide by the law, and appeal to the demonstrators to go home peaceably. Max agrees, and the two appear together on television – and in person the next day, using the less offensive mantra \\"Fifteen and Ready\\". Most states agree to lower the voting age within days, in the wake of the demonstrations, and Max Frost and the Troopers campaign for Johnny Fergus until the election, which he wins by a landslide. Taking his place in the Senate, Fergus wishes Frost and his people would now just go away, but instead they get involved with Washington politics. When a Congressman from Sally LeRoy's home district dies suddenly, the band enters her in the special election that follows, and Sally – the eldest of the group, and the only one of majority age to run for office – is voted into Congress by the new teen bloc. The first bill Sally introduces is a constitutional amendment to lower the age requirements for national political office to 14, and \\"Fourteen or Fight!\\" enters a new phase. A joint session of Congress is called, and the Troopers – now joined by Fergus's son, Jimmy (Michael Margotta) – swing the vote their way by spiking the Washington, D.C. water supply with LSD, and providing all the Senators and Representatives with teenaged escorts. As teens either take over or threaten the reins of government, the \\"Old Guard\\" (those over 40) turn to Max to run for president, and assert his (their) control over the changing tide. Max again agrees, running as a Republican to his chagrin, but once in office, he turns the tide on his older supporters. Thirty becomes a mandatory retirement age, while those over 35 are rounded up, sent to \\"re-education camps\\", and permanently dosed on LSD. Fergus unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Max by contacting his estranged parents (Bert Freed and Shelley Winters), then tries to assassinate him. Failing at this, he flees Washington, D.C. with his remaining family, but they are soon rounded up. With youth now in control of the United States, politically as well as economically, similar revolutions break out in all the world's major countries. Max withdraws the military from around the world (turning them instead into de facto \\"age police\\"), puts computers and prodigies in charge of the gross national product, ships surplus grain for free to Third World nations, disbands the FBI and Secret Service, and becomes the leader of \\"the most truly hedonistic society the world has ever known\\". Ultimately however, Max and his cohorts may face future intergenerational warfare from an unexpected source: pre-teen children. When a young girl finds out Max's age (which is now 24), she sneers, \\"That's old!\\" Later, after Max kills a crawdad that was a pet to several young kids, then mocks their youth and powerlessness, one of the kids resolves, \\"We're gonna put everybody over 10 out of business.\\" Cast * Shelley Winters as Mrs. Max Flatow (Frost) * Christopher Jones as Max Jacob Flatow Jr., a.k.a.

Lowering the voting age was a genuine issue in 1968 and was not passed until 1970 with Oregon v. Mitchell lowering the presidential minimum voting age to 18 and 1971 with the 26th Amendment lowering local and state election minimum voting ages to 18. The movie features cameos from several media personalities, including Melvin Belli, Dick Clark, Pamela Mason, Army Archerd, and Walter Winchell. Millie Perkins and Ed Begley have supporting roles, and Bobby Sherman interviews Max as president. In a pre-Brady Bunch role, Barry Williams plays the teenaged Max Frost at the beginning of the movie. Child actress Kellie Flanagan, who plays Johnny Fergus's daughter, Mary, also appeared in director Barry Shear's television special All Things Bright and Beautiful in the same year. She discussed filming Wild in the Streets in a 2014 interview with Adam Gerace, telling him, \\"I get a huge kick out of Wild in the Streets and always have.\\" According to filmmaker Kenneth Bowser, the part eventually played by Christopher Jones was first offered to folk singer Phil Ochs. After reading the screenplay, Ochs rejected the offer, claiming the story distorted the actual nature of the youth counterculture of the period. Music A soundtrack album was released on Tower Records and became successful, peaking at #12 on the Billboard charts. Taken from the soundtrack and film, \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" (written by songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil) and performed by the fictional band Max Frost and the Troopers, was released as a single (backed with \\"Free Lovin' \\") and also became a hit, reaching #22 on Billboard. Release Wild in the Streets was first released to theaters in 1968. Its storyline was a reductio ad absurdum projection of contemporary issues of the time, taken to extremes, and played poignantly during 1968 —an election year with many controversies (the Vietnam War, the draft, civil rights, the population explosion, rioting and assassinations, and the baby boomer generation coming of age). The original magazine short story, titled \\"The Day It All Happened, Baby!\\" was expanded by its author to book length, and was published as a paperback novel by Pyramid Books. In 1969, Fred R. Feitshans Jr. and Eve Newman were both nominated for the Oscar for Best Film Editing for their work on this film, but ultimately lost to Frank P. Keller, who won for Bullitt. Wild in the Streets was released on VHS home video in the late 1980s, and in 2005 appeared on DVD, on a Midnite Movies twofer disc with another AIP movie, 1971's Gas-s-s-s.  In popular culture  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century, page 43, panels 1–2: \\"I mean that the current president of the United States is Max Foster. Max Foster the pop singer. He's setting up camps for anyone he thinks is too straight.

Its two summits used to be separated by the Setun River, until one of the summits was razed in 1987. Since 1936, the area has been part of Moscow and now contains the Victory Park with many tanks and other vehicles used in the Second World War on display. Historically, the hill had great strategic importance, as it commanded the best view of the Russian capital. Its name is derived from the Russian for \\"to bow down\\", as everyone approaching the capital from the west was expected to do homage here. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, it was the spot where Napoleon in vain expected the keys to the Kremlin to be brought to him by Russians.  Victory Park  In the 1960s, the Soviet authorities decided to put the area to use as an open-air museum dedicated to the Russian victory over Napoleon. The New Triumphal Arch, erected in wood in 1814 and in marble in 1827 to a design by Osip Bove, was relocated and reconstructed here in 1968. A loghouse, where Kutuzov presided over the Fili conference which decided to abandon Moscow to the enemy, was designated a national monument. The huge panorama \\"Battle of Borodino\\" by Franz Roubaud (1910–12) was installed here in 1962. A monument to Kutuzov was opened in 1973. The Victory Park and the Square of Victors are important parts of the outdoor museum. In 1987 the hill was leveled to the ground and in the 1990s an obelisk was added with a statue of Nike and a monument of St George slaying the dragon, both designed by Zurab Tsereteli. The obelisk's height is exactly , which is for every day of the War. A golden- domed Orthodox church was erected on the hilltop in 1993-95, followed by a memorial mosque and the Holocaust Memorial Synagogue. On 9 May 1995 the first post-Soviet victory parade was held here, with President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and Minister of Defence and General of the Army Pavel Grachev in attendance. Commanding the parade was commander of the Moscow Military District Colonel-General Leonid Kuznetsov. This parade was also the first major display of the new post-Soviet army uniforms. At the 60th V-day celebrations in 2005, President Vladimir Putin inaugurated 15 extravagant bronze columns, symbolizing main fronts and navies of the Red Army during World War II.

School characteristics  Pigeon Forge High School is located at 414 Tiger Drive, near the Parkway that serves as the main transportation artery of the city of Pigeon Forge. The high school was established in 1999 in a building that had previously been the Pigeon Forge Middle School. Beginning with only the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, Pigeon Forge High School added one grade per year, graduating its first class in the 2002-2003 academic year. Located on a campus of some , PFHS has added a number of athletic and scholastic facilities since its first year. Its proximity to facilities maintained by the city of Pigeon Forge, such as the city park and community center and library complex, make a variety of services available to students. Governed and operated by the Sevier County Board of Education, Pigeon Forge High School receives a part of the system's annual operating budget of $68,353,327, averaging an expenditure of $5,212 per student annually. A three-tier system of tracking is in place to allow learning in the skills, standard, and honors venues in order to best meet the needs of students at varying ability levels. To supplement all these offerings, the student body is also able to participate in a variety of extracurricular sports ranging from wrestling to biking and an array of intellectual pursuits including a Beta club as well as many others. Demographics The faculty at Pigeon Forge High School is a certified staff of 53 full-time and 5 part-time teachers with an average class size of 25. Over 50% of the staff has more than five years of experience. Pigeon Forge High School has a student body of over 700 members. With a slightly higher percentage of male students (54% to the females’ 46%), the student body is overwhelmingly Caucasian (85%) with small populations of Native-American (3%), Hispanic (9%), African-American (1%), Asian(1%), and other ethnic groups (1%). English as a Second Language (ESL) classes have become a focus of some administrative attention in recent times in order to meet the needs of those students (9%) whose primary language is Spanish. Roughly 40% of students participate in the free and reduced-price lunch program. Overall attendance remains quite good, with only 5% of the student body absent on a daily basis. Transfer rates are relatively high, possibly due to the very nature of Pigeon Forge’s economy, which is predominantly seasonal.

Legg is the chairman of the Eurosceptic Bruges Group. Directorship Prior to becoming an MP Legg was a director of Hillsdown Holdings, one of Britain's biggest food groups at that time and owner of leading brands such as Typhoo tea, Hartley's jam and Buxted chickens, having joined the firm in 1978. He became company secretary in 1982 and a director in 1986. He left Hillsdown \\"by mutual consent\\" in September 1992 with a 'golden handshake' of £200,000 \\"after it was decided to replace him with someone who could devote their full energies to the job.\\" Career in local government Legg – an accountant and tax specialist – entered politics in 1978 as a Conservative councillor for the Regent's Park ward on Westminster City Council. He became the Conservative Chief Whip on the council during Dame Shirley Porter's leadership. He was later linked with the 'homes for votes scandal' in which council homes in eight key marginal wards were sold instead of being re-let to council tenants or used to alleviate homelessness. Believing that council tenants were more likely to vote Labour, the Conservative council intended that this strategy would result in \\"a pattern of tenure which is more likely to translate into Conservative votes.\\" A second independent inquiry identified Legg as the chairman of a secret Westminster council committee meeting that took the decision in 1989 to place 100 homeless families, including 150 children, in two dilapidated tower blocks already known to be full of asbestos. A report from 1983 had warned: \\"It is considered that these two tower blocks... may provide the greatest potential for asbestos release within residential accommodation in Britain.\\" The official inquiry found that it was \\"abundantly clear\\" that the committee knew that the tower blocks, Chantry Point and Hermes Point in Paddington, had asbestos problems and were in a terrible condition. The District Auditor also found that the decision, \\"leaving aside the serious ethical concerns that it raised, was unlawful because it was taken by a secret and unaccountable group.\\" The scandal was the subject of an exposé by social affairs programme Public Eye, broadcast on 30 November 1995 on BBC Two. Legg's time as a councillor and his conduct in public life and business were the subject of a joint investigation by The Guardian newspaper and the BBC Radio 4 Today programme in May 2003. Career in Parliament After being defeated by Labour's Derek Foster at Bishop Auckland in 1983, Legg gained election for Milton Keynes South West at the 1992 General Election. He was unseated at the 1997 General Election. Described as an 'unreconstructed' Thatcherite, Legg is a co-founder of the Conservative Way Forward campaigning group and was a member of the No Turning Back Group (NTBG) and one of the Maastricht Rebels. =Tax reform= In 1992 Legg co-authored Maintaining Momentum: a Radical Tax Agenda for the 1990s which proposed a reduction in the basic rate of income tax to 20%, the abolition of Inheritance Tax and temporarily raising the threshold for higher rate income tax to £100,000, followed by its abolition. =Welfare reform= In 1993 Legg was the co-author, with Iain Duncan Smith and 3 other members of the NTBG, of a report which proposed cutting £8 billion from the social security budget. The report made a number of recommendations: *Merging all means-tested and other non-contributory benefits into a single benefit called \\"whole person benefit\\" (WPB) *Privatisation of the National Insurance \\"pay-as-you-go\\" benefit system and introduction of private pensions and private insurance against unemployment, long-term sickness and invalidity *Abolition of child benefit *Introduction of smart card technology to reduce fraud *Equalisation of retirement ages for men and women at 67 *Abolition of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme *Cutting the entitlement to unemployment benefit from 12 months to 6 months *Abolition of mortgage tax relief, rent rebates and housing benefits. Chief Executive of the Conservative Party On 14 February 2003 Legg was controversially appointed by Iain Duncan Smith to be the new Conservative Party Chief Executive – \\"against the wishes of the party's ruling board\\" – and Chief of Staff of Duncan Smith's private office. The appointment was vetoed by the board and Legg, described as Duncan Smith's \\"right wing ally unpopular with many MPs\\", resigned on 7 May 2003 with a six-figure severance package.

Construction of the first railway line in Sweden began in 1855. The major operator of passenger trains is the state- owned SJ AB. In 1988, prompted by SJ's large deficits, the Swedish parliament privatized the network by ordering that the ownership of rail infrastructure be separated from the ownership of train operations, and opened up the system to private sector train operators by introducing competitive tendering for local rail service contracts. Unlike the roads, railways in Sweden use left handed traffic for the trains (same as metro), because Sweden drove on the left until 1967, but railways did not switch traffic due to extremely high cost. Only railways in Malmö and further south use RHT due to connection with Denmark. Sweden is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Sweden is 74. Operators Major national passenger train operators SJ AB (usually just called SJ), and the cargo transport operator, Green Cargo, are both fully owned by the state. A private company Tågkompaniet operates in central Sweden, and there are a number of regional companies. Tram systems are used in Gothenburg, Norrköping and Stockholm. There is a metro system in Stockholm, the Stockholm Metro. Dining car at the luxury blue train from Uppsala to Gothenburg at Stockholm Central Station While most current railway lines of Sweden were determined and built by the state, and receive their technical upkeep from the public as well, SJ no longer holds a monopoly on operating and owning passenger trains where such can be run profitably on a commercial basis. Large parts of the rail network serve parts of the country which don't generate enough passenger or cargo traffic to make a profit, and on some of these stretches SJ has held a de facto monopoly until very recently (2010, see below in this section) Average speed is an important factor regarding profitability (more distance per hour means more income per hour). For regional trains (within a county or up to about 100 km distance) the counties will buy traffic, signing a contract with an operator. The operator is often SJ, but sometimes another operator, either Swedish or from one of the other EU countries, provides the service. For these regional trains the county transport authority sells tickets. For long- distance trains (i.e. longer than the regional trains) that are not profitable, a national authority \\"Rikstrafiken\\" signs a contract with an operator to move traffic on each line (Public Service Obligation). In this case each operator markets and sell tickets. The operator for unprofitable services usually rents trains from the county transport authority or a special state organisation. This is because trains are expensive, take from two to three years to buy (from tender to delivery), and are hard to sell if the operator loses the contract. However, for the SJ monopoly traffic, SJ usually own the trains. A decision was made in March 2009 to cancel the monopoly for SJ. Already in the autumn 2009 free competition will be allowed on Saturdays and Sundays when there is more room on the tracks, and to a full extent all days in the autumn 2010. Rail traffic is supervised by the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket), a government agency.  History  The first Swedish railroad for public transport using horse-drawn carriages, the Frykstads railroad in Värmland was opened in 1849. In 1853 the Riksdag of the Estates decided that the State would build main line railways, but that other lines would be built by private enterprises (often with cities as main owners), and in 1856 the first stretch, between Örebro and Nora (a private railroad), was opened for traffic. The main line railways were of major importance for the development of the Swedish industry. The first two main line railways were the Southern, stretching from Stockholm to Malmö in the south, and the Western, to Gothenburg in the west. These line railways were finished between 1860-1864. The Northern railway runs parallel to the Baltic coast (but not along it) up to Boden in northern Sweden, and was finished in 1894. The Inland Railway runs from Gällivare in the north to Kristinehamn in the center of the country, through the central parts of northern Sweden, and was built between 1908-1937. It was a part of the 1853 decision that the railways should avoid coasts, and not make detours to pass medium size cities along the route. The reason for avoiding coasts (most evident for the railway to northern Sweden) was to protect it from military attacks, and because steam boats were already established along the coasts as a much faster transport method than before. Railways built by private companies, e.g. Västkustbanan (1888), were however sometimes built very close to the coast. The construction of the early main lines provided a fast and safe connection from the mines in the north to the rest of Sweden. It also facilitated business (and private) travel, which had earlier required horse-drawn carriages. Roslagsbanan is the oldest electrified railway line for personnel transportation in northern Europe. Malmbanan, the railway line between Luleå, Sweden, and Narvik, Norway was inaugurated on July 14, 1903. The stretch between Kiruna and Riksgränsen was the first major railway line in Sweden to be electrified in 1915. Main Line railways built in Sweden between 1860-1930. Network *Total: 15006.25 km (includes 3,600 km of privately owned railways) *standard gauge: 15006.25 km of gauge (8100 km electrified and 4925.75 km double track (2008) *narrow gauge: 221 km of (Swedish three foot) gauge (2001).But narrow gauge is now dismantled & made as standard gauge (2019).  LinesMain lines = There used to be six main lines (stambanor), all nationally owned: *Västra stambanan (Western main line), 453 km, Stockholm-Gothenburg through Katrineholm- Hallsberg-Laxå-Falköping *Södra stambanan (Southern main line), 381 km, Malmö- Falköping through Nässjö-Jönköping *Östra stambanan (Eastern main line), 216 km, Nässjö-Katrineholm through Mjölby-Linköping-Norrköping) *Norra stambanan (Northern main line), 484 km, Stockholm-Ånge through Uppsala-Avesta Krylbo *Stambanan genom övre Norrland (Main line through upper Norrland), 629 km, Bräcke-Boden through Långsele-Vännäs *Nordvästra stambanan (Northwestern main line), 209 km, Laxå-Norwegian border through Karlstad-Kil-Charlottenberg Also these lines have for a period been called main lines: *Mittbanan (Norrland cross line), about 500 km, Sundsvall-Norwegian border through Ånge-Östersund *Inlandsbanan, about 1300 km, Kristinehamn-Gällivare through Mora-Östersund The principle was that the main lines were built by the state, but all others by private companies, often owned by cities to support their local need. In the period 1930-1950 most lines were purchased by the state, making the main line term less well defined. Today, changes have been made in the terminology making the number of main lines four. The northwestern main line is not considered a main line anymore and is renamed Värmlandsbanan. The southern main line between Nässjö and Falköping is also degraded since now what was the Eastern main line (Nässjö - Katrineholm) is considered a part of the southern one. The Norrland cross line is not a main line anymore, but a regional railway. Finally the northern main line south of Ockelbo refers to another and shorter way than that through Avesta. Sometimes the Ostkustbanan Stockholm- Sundsvall is now considererd a main line, since it has the majority of the passenger traffic into Norrland. Inlandsbanan was considered a main line for a few decades, but is now a tourist railway only. The main lines are still owned by the state, except Inlandsbanan which is owned by the counties. =Other lines= *Ådalsbanan *Älmhult-Olofström railway *Älvsborgsbanan *Bastuträsk- Skelleftehamn railway *Bergslagsbanan *Bergslagspendeln *Blekinge kustbana *Bofors-Strömtorp railway *Bohusbanan *Bollnäs-Furudal *Botniabanan *Dalabanan *Forsmo-Hoting railway *Fryksdalsbanan *Godsstråket genom Bergslagen *Godsstråket genom Skåne *Göteborgs hamnbana *Halmstad-Nässjö railway *Haparandabanan *Jönköpingsbanan *Kinnekullebanan *Kontinentalbanan *Kristinehamn-Persberg railway *Kust till kust-banan *Lilla Edet-Alvhem railway *Lysekilsbanan *Malmbanan *Markarydsbanan *Mellansel-Örnsköldsvik railway *Mora-Märbäck railway *Morjärv-Karlborgsbruk railway *Mälarbanan *Nässjö-Åseda railway *Nässjö-Oskarshamn railway *Norge-/Vänerbanan *Nynäsbanan *Örbyhus-Hallstavik railway *Öresundsbanan *Österlenbanan *Ostkustbanan *Piteåbanan *Roslagsbanan *Rååbanan *Sala-Oxelösund railway *Skånebanan *Storuman-Hällnäs railway *Stångådalsbanan *Svealandsbanan *Söderhamn-Kilafors railway *Södra stambanan *Tjustbanan *Viskadalsbanan *Vännäs-Holmsund railway *Västerdalsbanan *Västkustbanan *Ystadbanan  Railway links with adjacent countries  * Denmark - yes - same gauge - voltage change 15 kV AC / 25 kV AC - Øresund Bridge and train ferry Göteborg - Frederikshavn. * Finland - yes, but break-of-gauge / (short dual gauge track between the two stations closest to the border, without overhead lines.

Proposed fixed links from Ystad to Stettin via Bornholm Island and from Karlskrona to Gdynia, both with 25 kV AC and SE-C loading gauge (voltage change 25 kV AC / 3kV DC at the Polish ends) Sweden and Norway have the same ATC system and the same voltage, meaning that trains can generally cross the border without being specially modified. Sweden and Denmark have different ATC systems and different voltage, so only specially modified trains can cross the border. The X31K Öresund trains and some of the SJ X2 (branded X2000) trains can do that. Train ferries never have electric overhead lines on board, so diesel must be used to get trains onboard/offboard. Generally locomotives are not transported on these ferries, only train cars. International passenger trains today (2016) operate on rather few lines: * Norway ** From Oslo to Gothenburg and to Stockholm ** From Narvik to Stockholm via Kiruna ** From Trondheim to Storlien * Denmark ** From Copenhagen via Øresund bridge to Malmö, to Stockholm, to Gothenburg and to Ystad * Germany ** From Berlin via train ferry to Malmö No passenger trains operate between Finland and Sweden, neither through Haparanda/Tornio nor train ferry to Turku.

At roughly it would have been over shorter than the two primary steam railroads on that route, the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. The promoters' vision proved wildly optimistic and, in the end, only a short interurban route in the vicinity of Gary, Indiana was built and operated. It was the most ambitious of several such proposals at the dawn of electric railroading, all of which ended in failure. Disambiguation The term Air Line had several distinct meanings in the history of the scheme and its aftermath, and these can be confusing: * Scheme. This refers to the proposed Chicago to New York express line. * Company. This was the Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad Company (CNYEAL), set up as a promotional and holding company. The construction was to be done by subsidiaries. The Company ceased in 1913. * Railway. This was the result of the first phase of construction by the first such subsidiary, the Goshen, South Bend and Chicago Railroad (GSB&C;), comprising a fragment of the main line and a branch to La Porte, Indiana. (In the US, the term railroad usually referred to heavy-rail steam lines and railway to light-rail electric interurbans, although the promoters of the scheme wished to identify with the former.) The Railway ceased in 1917. * System. This comprised the GSB&C; and two subsidiaries of its own, the Gary Connecting Railways and the Valparaiso and Northern Railway which together made up the second phase of the scheme. The three together formed a little interurban system to the east of Gary, Illinois. The last fragment of this only closed down in 1942. * Service. This was the public passenger service running on the GSB&C;, from Hammond, Indiana to La Porte via Gary. HistoryBackground= The Air Line scheme was not the first proposed high-speed electric railway in the USA. In 1893 Dr. Wellington Adams promoted a Chicago–St. Louis route with a maximum operating speed of . Adams believed the new railroad could be built in a year for $5.5 million ($ adjusted for inflation). Trade publications ridiculed the proposal, and it went nowhere. Elsewhere, global developments in electric railroading was proceeding apace at the turn of the century. In 1903, a railcar from Siemens & Halske and AEG reached on the experimental Marienfelde–Zossen military railway outside Berlin. Commercial projects, however, did not progress. Proposed electric railways such as Berlin–Hamburg and Wien–Budapest proved too expensive. Several interurbans in the United States had made fast demonstration runs at the same time. In 1903 an interurban on the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway covered the between Aurora and Chicago in 34 minutes 39 seconds despite the loss of over 6 minutes in stops, and numerous speed reductions for steam railroads, trolley lines (tramways), and street and highway crossings. In 1905 Pacific Electric mogul Henry E. Huntington made the Los Angeles–Long Beach run () in 15 minutes in a private railcar at an average speed at was higher than for the projected Air Line trains. =Proposal= Alexander C. Miller (1852–1918) had been the chief dispatcher of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad before founding the Aurora Trust and Savings Bank in his home town of Aurora, Illinois (served by the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway) and establishing the Miller Train Control Corporation to market his invention of a railroad signalling block system.Grant, R: Electric Interurbans and the American People 2016 p. 41 In July 1906, he took out advertisements in Chicago newspapers for the Chicago–New York Electric Air Line Railroad Company, offering 20 000 $100 shares in this firm (the unit shares were later reduced to $25). The company avoided raising funds through bonds or the money market, and relied entirely on selling shares. This was important later -there was to be no need to pay interest on capital. The form of the name -Chicago before New York- demonstrated the focus of the initial advertising campaign.Hilton & Due: The Electric Interurban Railways in America Stanford University Press 1960 p. 39Grant op. cit. p. 42 The proposed physical characteristics of the project were impressive, and far ahead of contemporary practice: Quadruple track (later reduced to double) on a hundred-foot-wide (30 metre) right of way, grades not exceeding 1%, no grade crossings, and a straight-line route which, at , would be shorter than other routes. Further, it was promised that there would be no curves requiring speeds below . Trains would run at an average , and complete the journey between Chicago and New York in 10 hours at a flat fare of $10.Hilton & Due op. cit. p. 39 The motive power was to be electric locomotives powered by a third rail -there were no working prototypes of these yet.Grant op. cit. p. 48 At the time the two fastest steam-hauled trains between New York and Chicago, the New York Central Railroad's 20th Century Limited and the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pennsylvania Special (forerunner of the more famous Broadway Limited), each required twenty hours to make the journey. Part of the proposal was that the main line would avoid towns and cities on the way, but that these would be provided with feeder spurs or branches.Hilton & Due op. cit. p. 39 Mentioned were Toledo, Cleveland and Pittsburgh (although the branch to the last named would have been lengthy).Grant op.cit. p. 42. =Inception= The Air Line Company was set up to be a holding company, with the actual construction done by a series of local firms established under state laws. The first, and only, one of these was incorporated under the state laws of Indiana on 16 April 1904Buckley op. cit. p 9 and was the Goshen, South Bend and Chicago Railroad (GSB&C;).Buckley, Gary Railways 1975 p. 3. It contracted the Co-operative Construction Company (formed for the purpose by one of the promoters named Jonathon D. Price) to begin work, and obtained the necessary land by having another promoter, Colonel Upshaw P. Hord, persuade local farmers to exchange land in return for shares. Construction began ceremonially on 1 September 1906 at La Porte, Indiana, on the first of the feeder branches from downtown to a rural location dubbed South La Porte where the junction with the main line and the operating headquarters were to be. Miller cut the first sod there with a silver spade, and there was much junketing. However, serious work only began in the New Year.Chesterton Tribune op. cit. The branch took until 15 June 1907 to finish and open, and this slow progress was the first sign of problems.Buckley op. cit. p. 5 For the opening, the CSB&C; bought two standard wooden combine interurban electric passenger cars from the Niles Car and Manufacturing Company. As a publicity stunt, their paintwork included destination names reading New York at one end and Chicago at the other. Down each side was Chicago Air Line New York.Hilton & Due op. cit. p. 39 The car barn built at South La Porte had a fascia reading Chicago New York Air Line, and Air Line was to be the name used for the passenger service of the CSB&C; throughout its history.Buckley op. cit. p. 4 Meanwhile, the promoters had begun the publication of a monthly periodical boosting the scheme, the Air Line News, in October 1906. This dramatized every development in the construction work, for example: \\"A huge Vulcan steam shovel is already on the job, taking big bites out of hills that stand in the path of the straight and level speedway that is to be the Air Line\\".Middleton 1968 op. cit. p. 29 The editor was Charles Burton, a veteran Indiana journalist and former printer of the state's official publications.Grant op. cit. p 43 The project was trumpeted nationally, stock sold with great rapidity and, by the end of the year, the company had 15 000 shareholders and funds of $2 000 000.Chesterton Tribune op. cit. =Building the main line= The section of the main line that was actually built, , ran from South La Porte westwards to a location north of Woodville named Goodrum after George C. Goodrum, a major shareholder from Fall River, Massachusetts.Buckley op. cit. p 5 There were three railroad crossings in this distance, over the Pere Marquette Railway, Monon Railroad and the Wabash Railroad. Each of these was provided with a heavy girder bridge, approached by immense fills to keep the gradients down. The fill material came from two deep cuts on the route. The track was built to steam-road standards, allegedly with 85 pound (38.5 kg) rail and white oak ties -in fact, 60 pound (27 kg) rails were used.Buckley op. cit. p. 9 Every sixth tie was extra long to accommodate the future third conducting rail, although a trolley wire was strung to power the cars as a temporary measure. Only a single track was laid, although there was space for a second.Hilton & Due op. cit. p. 39 Investors were taken out to view these two portions of the line in operation, and the continuing work. However, further progress continued to be slow and the depression of 1907–1908 worsened the financial problems arising. The main line was opened to Westville Road (Route 421), just east of the Monon Railroad bridge, in June 1908. To generate some revenue, an amusement park called \\"Air Line Park\\" was set up west of the Pere Marquette Railroad bridge. This proved very successful, and thousands visited on weekends when a ten-cent shuttle service from La Porte was provided. This was to be the only public service on the main line for the next three years, running from La Porte to Westville Road and back.Fischler, S: Moving Millions: An Inside Look at Mass Transit 1979 p. 60 The eventual downfall of the Air Line scheme arose as a result of the capital expended on crossing Coffee Creek, a minor watercourse running west of the Wabash Railroad bridge. To keep to the advertised grade prescribed by the incredibly stringent engineering specifications, the GSB&C; engineered a monstrous fill across the little creek's valley, 180 feet (55 metres) wide and two miles (3 km) long and containing a steel trestle for stability. The extent of this work meant that the line only opened to Goodrum on 1 November 1911.Hilton & Due op. cit. p. 40Buckley op. cit. p. 8 The immense expense occasioned by this engineering work, and some alleged (but never prosecuted or substantiated) accounting irregularities as well as other putatively fraudulent practices, led to the failure of the main line to extend beyond a dozen and a half miles through the Indiana countryside. The GSB&C; only ever ran a total of on its own tracks, according to its official reports.Buckley op. cit. p. 7 =Gary and Interurban Railway= The GSB&C; Air Line railway company quickly morphed into an electric railway system serving the new city of Gary, and this process was underway even before the Coffee Creek fill was finished in 1911. Gary came into being when the United States Steel Corporation constructed a new steelworks on a virgin site on Lake Michigan in the spring of 1906, and when the city was platted, three main streets were created wide enough to include reserve track streetcar lines. Hence, the streetcar service could use equipment of interurban standard (no wobbly little Birney trolley cars at first)—and this was reflected in the name of the streetcar company founded on 18 July 1907, the Gary and Interurban Railway. There was no initial official connection with the GSB&C;, but the Co-operative Construction Company building the latter's main line was also responsible for its construction. The system opened on 20 May 1908, and by year's end had a spine route north to south on Broadway. This ran from the steelworks main gate at 4th Avenue to the city limits at the Little Calumet River bridge, and two crosstown routes ran west of this to the city limits—one on 5th Avenue and the other on 11th Avenue (10th Avenue from Broadway to the Pennsylvania Railroad bridge).Buckley op. cit. p. 19 The first major extension of the system was to Hammond to the west, when the 11th Avenue line was extended via Clark Road, 9th Avenue, Summer (now 165th) Street and Sibley Street to a terminus loop on Calumet-State-Hohman. This opened on 8 February 1910.Buckley op. cit. p. 33 Unfortunately, as part of its franchise the streetcar company agreed with the city to limit fares within city limits to three cents for any ride, or ten for a quarter (25 cents). No provision was made for inflation.Buckley op. cit. p. 7 =Valparaiso and Northern Railway= Meanwhile, on 25 August 1908 the GSB&C; incorporated an independent but wholly owned subsidiary company, the Valparaiso and Northern Railway, to build two feeder branches connecting to the main line at Goodrum and serving Valparaiso to the south and Chesterton to the north. Again construction work dragged on, for the lines opened from Valparaiso to the popular recreational destination of Flint Lake on 4 July 1910, Chesterton to Goodrum on 18 February 1911, Flint Lake to Woodville on 7 October 1911 and from Woodville over a bridge crossing the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line to Goodrum on 17 February 1912. The GSB&C; was then given an east-to-north curve to connect to the new Valparaiso to Chesterton through line at Goodrum, while excavation continued to the west to the fourth railroad bridge which was to be over the B&O; at a very skew angle.Buckley op. cit. p. 5 =Gary Connecting Railways= By 1911, it was obvious that the future of the GSB&C; Air Line railway could only be secured by providing an immediate connection with the streetcar network of Gary. So, on 1 June 1911 a company entitled the Gary Connecting Railways was incorporated as the second wholly owned subsidiary of the GSB&C.; It immediately began construction of a connecting line, beginning at Broadway & 11th Avenue, downtown at Gary, and running down Central Avenue to East Gary. This was opened on 6 January 1912. (East Gary used to be called Lake Station, but changed its name to East Gary in 1908. It changed its name back to Lake Station in 1977, owing to Gary having become a post-industrial slum.) The line was completed to Woodville on 14 August 1912, and made a triangular wye junction with the Valparaiso and Northern Railway at a spot called Woodville Junction, just south of the latter's bridge over the B&O; railroad and on the other side of the latter from Goodrum.Buckley op. cit. p. 5 An important aspect of this connecting line was, that the route ran along the authorised route of the original Air Line scheme from East Gary until it met the B&O; railroad at a location called Babcock. It then hugged the south side of the railroad until it reached Woodville Junction. The direct skew bridge under construction over the railroad at Babcock was abandoned. This was the definitive indication that the dream of a Chicago to New York express line was finally dead.Buckley op. cit. p. 32 Also important was that the line crossed the Michigan Central Railroad at Garyton (now part of Portage) on the level. A junction curve was put in place for freight exchange, and the GSB&C; invested in dedicated equipment in to develop a freight service. The completion of this line also allowed a Hammond to La Porte via Gary passenger service, beginning 5 September 1912. This became known as the Air Line service locally.Buckley op. cit. p. 5 In the same year, the GSB&C; decided to shut its power plant at South La Porte and purchase electricity from a public source as this was cheaper.Buckley op. cit. p. 9 =East Chicago Street Railway= The last initiative of the GSB&C; was the promotion of a streetcar company called the East Chicago Street Railway to serve Indiana Harbor. This subsidiary was incorporated on 23 July 1912, and opened from the end of the 5th Avenue line at Gary's city limits via Cline Avenue, 145th Street, Cedar Street and Guthrie Street to a terminus on Watling Street.Buckley op. cit. pp. 32-33 This opened on 15 February 1913.Buckley op. cit. p. 5 =Gary and Interurban Railroad= Shareholders of the Air Line Company rebelled in 1911, and began a movement to purchase the Gary and Interurban Railway streetcar system in order to safeguard even a small part of their investment. This was successful, but the stock of the latter company was purchased with funds raised by the sale of 4% fixed interest bonds. When a controlling interest had been acquired, the Cary and Interurban Railroad Company was incorporated on 28 January 1913. This consolidated the GSB&C;, the Gary and Interurban Railway, the East Chicago Street Railway, the Gary Connecting Railways snd the Valparaiso and Northern Railway. The Chicago–New York Electric Air Line Railroad Company was wound up, and the Air Line News abruptly ceased publication. This was the official abandonment of the great express electric railway scheme.Buckley op. cit. p. 8 The morph from an express electric railway project into a city streetcar and interurban system was complete, but was only to last intact for just under five years. A loop line was added from Indiana Harbor to Hammond, from 145th & Main, Parish Avenue, Chicago Avenue and Kennedy Avenue -this became important for the freight service of the GSB&C.; Also added was a spur along Bridge Street in Gary to the gates of the American Bridge Company plant. =Gary and Southern Traction= The city of Gary had two other interurban lines, not part of the Air Line system but having trackage on it to access the downtown interurban station at 11th & Broadway and also to run on to the gates of the steelworks at the north end of Broadway. The first to open, in 1912, was the Gary and Southern Traction which continued the Broadway streetcar line to Lottaville (now part of Merrillville) and Crown Point. =Gary and Hobart Traction= The other was the Gary and Hobart Traction, which had an abortive opening with a gasoline car later in 1912 but was shut after a month. Electrification and permanent opening was in 1914.Buckley op. cit. p. 7 The route was along 37th Avenue from the Broadway line, through Froebel and New Chicago to terminate at 3rd and Main in Hobart. =End of original railway= The refusal of the city to allow fare rises for journeys in Gary led to a shortfall in income which caused the Gary and Interurban Railway company to default on a bond issue repayment at the start of 1915. As a result, a receiver was appointed on 17 October 1915. On 1 January 1916, one of the original cars and the GSB&C;'s work motor met in a head-on collision in fog at Brooks just west of Air Line Park. The passenger car was telescoped and had to be scrapped, three people were killed and twelve injured.Buckley op. cit. p. 11 On 18 September 1917 the receiver oversaw the breakup of the G&I; into its constituent parts, and their separate sale. The original Air Line company shareholders were finally wiped out. The GSB&C; was capitalised at $7 000 000. Its assets, comprising the line, rolling stock and equipment, were sold for $75 000. This was an upset price, meaning that it was the minimum acceptable according to a true valuation. Since the company was a statutory public service, for the next 24 days a shuttle was run from La Porte to Goodrum. After the required legal formalities, service on the Air Line railway ceased on 3 November 1917, and the tracks and bridges east of Goodrum were recovered for scrap.Buckley op. cit. p. 7 =Survival of system= The truncated Air Line system did, however, survive.Buckley op. cit. p. 9 The streetcar system became the Gary Street Railway in 1917, and continued to expand. in 1918 the line to the Sheet Mill and Tin Mill of the American Sheet & Tin Plate Company was opened from 5th Avenue & Buchanan Street. In 1924, a line was opened to the National Tube Company plant via 5th Avenue, Virginia Street and 2nd Avenue. Later in the same year, the 5th Avenue portion of this was extended as another new line, to Lake Street in Miller. On the other hand, the Indiana Harbor to Hammond line was abandoned as unprofitable and this was the first contraction. The lines from Gary to Valparaiso and Chesterton went to the Gary and Valparaiso Railway, which hence inherited what was left of the Air Line system. The Chesterton line was replaced by a bus in 1922. =Gary Railways= In 1925, there was a major consolidation of Gary's railways under the Gary Railways company which was owned by the Midland Utilities Corporation of Samuel Insull. All the surviving railways were annexed, except the Crown Point line which was bought out in 1928. Conversion of routes to buses began in 1933, with the Crown Point line beyond 45th Avenue. In 1935, the Miller line went and in 1938 the conversion of the whole system was begun. In that year the line between Tin Mill and Sheet Mill was closed, and the Valparaiso service cut back to Garyton on 22 October. This reduced the Air Line system to a stub. In 1939, the Hobart and Indiana Harbor lines went and the Fifth Avenue line cut back to the Pennsylvania Railroad station. Bridge Street and Tin Works were closed in 1940 and the stub on Fifth Avenue in 1941. =Final end= What was left at the start of 1942 were the Broadway, Hammond, Tube Works and Garyton lines. The last named terminated at a loop installed when the Valparaiso line closed in 1938, and the half mile of track before this was the very last section of the authorised route of the Air Line scheme to have a rail service.Buckley op. cit. p. 32 The final end of the Air Line saga came on 22 October 1942, when the last Garyton car returned to Gary in the evening. The outbreak of war saved the remaining lines for a time. The Hammond and Broadway lines were converted to buses in 1946, leaving a little shuttle service from 5th & Broadway to Tube Works. The last streetcar in Gary ran on 28 February 1948.Buckley op. cit. p. 19 Route The Air Line system before 1917 consisted of a main line from 11th and Broadway in Gary to La Porte, with two branches to Chesterton and Valparaiso. The Continuation line ran south-east along Central Avenue through Kimmel and Pine Street to East Gary, which it entered on Fairview Avenue. From Garyton, it took the authorised course of the original Air Line scheme through Garyton, Crisman, McCool and Babcock before following the B&O; railroad through Eastman to Woodville Junction where the Valparaiso branch met in a triangular wye. The line turned north as the Valparaiso Northern, and continued as the branch to Chesterton. This was a short distance, with no intermediate stops. The Valparaiso line had three intermediate stops at Wahob, Burlington Beach (for Flint Lake) and Vale Park. It terminated at Lincoln & Franklin without a loop but with a reversing wye on Lincoln. The Air Line service went round the north side of the triangular wye at Woodville junction, across the B&O; bridge to Goodrum. Here, it had to reverse onto the original Air Line railway because the junction curve was north to east, with a station building in the angle. The main line then ran arrow-straight due east to South La Porte. After the notorious Coffee Creek fill (now obliterated by the Toll Road), stops were: Smiley, County Line, Westville Road, Brooks, Air Line Park and Door Village. Apart from the last, these each had a short spur with the junction facing east. South La Porte is no longer a named locality, the rural location being at the south end of the main runway of La Porte Airport. However it was the operational headquarters, and had a combined car barn and power house. Here also was a north to east spur from the Pere Marquette Railroad (now also abandoned), allowing freight exchange and coal delivery to the power house. The track from this spur ran down the side of the power house and car barn to the La Porte Branch where the junction faced the city, and cars exited the barn down this track and reversed if they were going in the Goodrum direction. A short connecting line ran from next to the barn to the main line, west to east. The La Porte branch turned north before State Route 39, from the east of the car barn to run into La Porte along I Street via what is now S 150 W. After stops at Andrews and Fair Grounds, it arrived at a terminal loop running round Lincoln, Monroe, Jefferson and Madison. On Lincoln Way was also the terminal loop track of the two lines of another interurban, the Chicago, South Bend and Northern Indiana Railway to Michigan City and to Goshen via South Bend. The two companies were friendly, and exchanged freight here. Also, passengers for the Air Line used the CSB&NI; facilities since the GSB&C; did not maintain any in the city.Buckley op. cit. pp. 32-33 EquipmentPassengers= The GSB&C;'s little roster of rolling stock was subsumed into that of the Gary and Interurban Railroad in 1913. However, the company kept legal possession and so the stable was sold on with the line in 1917. The original two 1907 power cars obtained from the Niles Car and Manufacturing Company in 1907 were numbered 101 and 102. This pair's original paintwork proclaimed the \\"Chicago Air Line New York\\". They were renumbered G&I; 400 and 401 in 1913. To handle the traffic to the Air Line Park amusement ground, in 1909 three unpowered trailer cars were ordered from the McGuire-Cummings Manufacturing Company and these were originally numbered 103, 104 and 105. However, two more power cars were purchased from the McGuire-Cummings Company in 1912, which were given the numbers 103 and 104 and also names: Ohm and Ampere. The trailers became 105, 106 and 107. In 1913, these became G&I; 402, 403, 500, 2300 and 2301. 400 was wrecked in the fatal accident at Brooks on 1 January 1916, when it met the work motor 3000 (see below). Its sister, 401, was sold to The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company. 402 and 403 were sold to the Des Moines and Central Iowa Railway. 500 was apparently scrapped, but 2300 and 2301 went to the Gary and Valparaiso Railway.Buckley op. cit. p. 22 =Freight= There were six box cars for freight, numbered 2000 to 2005. Three of them were from McGuire-Cummings, but 2000 to 2002 were second-hand from an unknown manufacturer and were apparently disposed of or scrapped in 1913. The M-C cars kept their numbers. 2001 was cut down into a flat car numbered 2002 in 1922, and the other two were scrapped in 1926 Number 3000 was a double-truck M-C work motor which could haul box cars, and this also kept its number in 1913. Its fate in 1917 is unknown. Finally, 1001 was an express freight motor cars, new from M-C and built for the job -not a converted passenger car. This also was sold to the Des Moines and Central Iowa Railway, and survived into the Fifties.Buckley op. cit. pp. 21-33Buckley op. cit. pp. 21-33 All this freight equipment was also bought in 1912. OperationsPassenger= After the opening of the connecting line to Gary from Woodville in 1912, the Air Line service comprised a through run from Hammond to La Porte via Gary, and used the four cars 101 to 104. This was semi-fast, dovetailed to run in between local services, and had a 15-minute layover at the main interurban station at Gary which was at 11th and Broadway. The total time taken to get to La Porte from Hammond was two and a half hours. The New York Central Railroad ran from Indiana Harbor, just north of Hammond, to La Porte in one and three quarter hours.Official Guide February 1926 p. 169 At first, there were eight weekday return trips and nine at weekends. In 1916 this was down to six each way daily. At Woodville Junction, the service connected with shuttles running to Chesterton and Valparaiso. The former was a short ride, but the latter had three intermediate stops at Wahob, Burlington Beach (for Flint Lake) and Vale Park. Very limited services were offered from Gary direct to the two towns. =Freight= The GSB&C; actively solicited freight traffic after 1912, when it bought an electric motor, box cars and an express car. By 1916, it had forty regular shippers. Before 1912, very limited less-than-carload (LCL) freight could be accommodated in the baggage compartments of the passenger cars. Dedicated local service was offered after that year from Indiana Harbor via Hammond, through Gary and Garyton to Woodville and then through La Porte to South Bend and Goshen via the Chicago, South Bend and Northern Indiana Railway. Thus, the Goshen, South Bend and Chicago Railway could finally claim to serve the first city in its title -even though not with a passenger service. Freight forwarding to more distant locations was also done via the connections to the Pere Marquette Railroad at South La Porte and the Michigan Central Railroad at Garyton. The freight depot was opposite the passenger station at 11th & Broadway in Gary. The most important commodity was milk, because roads in rural Indiana were still unsealed and the interurban gave local farmers marketing opportunities in Gary which they would not otherwise have. In 1913 70 cans went to Gary daily, but in 1916 there were 270. After the GSB&C; was abandoned in 1917, freight traffic on the Gary streetcar network mostly ceased.Buckley op. cit. p. 17 Remains Earthworks on the Air Line's right-of-way and some of the colossal concrete bridge abutments are still visible to this day, and much of the route is visible as property boundaries. The abutments are on the abandoned Pere Marquette and Monon railroad lines. Indiana Historical Bureau erected a historical marker in 1995 commemorating the scheme at CR250S & IN-39. The scanty ruins of the South La Porte power house cum car barn are extant near here, to the west of IN-39. If you go down south on S 150 W, continuing I Street from La Porte, you can find a track to the north of a farmstead, which is on the alignment of the main line to New York. It stopped right here, and got no further. At the other end, at Goodrum, ruins of a power house are in woods on the east side of IN-49 south of the Indiana Toll Road and near the junction with the N Calumet Avenue (the old IN-49). The Coffee Creek fill has mostly been obliterated by the building of the Toll Road. Legacy The Air Line project has been called the greatest fiasco of the interurban era.Middleton 1968, p. 29 However, the completed portion did became the progenitor of a successful street railway system after the initial financial woes. Also, several other interurbans to as high a standard as the Air Line – though at a much smaller scale – were built. In 1907, the Philadelphia and Western Railroad opened its Upper Darby–Strafford line near Philadelphia with maximum grades of 2%, no grade crossings, and an absolute block signalling system (Middleton 1968, p. 109). And after World War I, the railway tycoon Samuel Insull upgraded the interurbans around Chicago, and station-to-station averages as high as 70 miles per hour were frequently attained (Middleton 1968, p. 67). Parts of these lines are in use even today. In 1943, Commander Edwin J. Quinby wrote a lengthy history of the CNYEAL for the publication Electric Railroads and closed the report with the following: NotesReferences  Crane, Mary (October 1946). \\"Chicago - New York Electric Air Line Railroad,\\" Trains magazine.  *  External links  *Archives of the Chicago-New York Electric Air Line Railroad *Historical Bureau marker *Railroads website, list of extant remains Category:Defunct Indiana railroads Category:Transportation in Gary, Indiana Category:Interurban railways in Indiana ","title":"Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad"},{"id":"2489613","text":"Plan 9 from Outer Space is a point and click adventure game adaptation of the film of the same name. It was developed at the Irish office of Gremlin Graphics for the Amiga and Atari ST, and was released in 1992. The game was published by Gremlin in Europe and by Konami in the United States. A DOS version was also developed, though only released in the US and Europe. Two editions of the game were made available at retail; the more common version was packaged with a VHS copy of the film, while a rarer version contained only the game. Background The game is inspired by the 1959 Z-movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. Plot The game starts when the producer notices that the film has been stolen by Bela Lugosi's double. The player must carry out an epic search of the locations where Plan 9 from Outer Space was filmed to find the six missing reels. From the back of the DOS version box: :Plan 9. The critics hated it. Bela Lugosi died during it. And his double has stolen it. :Lugosi's replacement is still bitter after 33 years from critics' reviews dubbing his only movie \\"The Worst Film of All-Time\\". Even though he remained faceless, he intends to bring glory to the cult classic using more footage of himself and ... colorizing it. As the studio's Private Eye you'll search over 70 locations, find the 6 reels and screen the film, frame-by-frame, to ensure that the warped actor did not cut Bela from the flick. Using actual digitized film footage, you'll sweat each scene, examining Plan 9 with slow motion, freeze frame, fast forward and rewind. It's up to you to preserve its original awfulness. Reception Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai criticized the game's \\"cheap\\" user interface and mediocre graphics and sound, which made him uncertain whether various continuity errors were accidental or intended to satirize the film. Ardai stated that \\"Plan 9 is a genuinely, intentionally funny piece of work, which puts it several notches above the movie (in my opinion) ... thoroughly enjoyable\\", and funnier than Zak McCracken. He added, however, that as \\"a licensed product, parasitic on an original work ... its smirking digs at this rather pathetic relic of a movie ... sometimes has the tone of a schoolyard bully taking cheap shots at a defenseless victim\\". Without the sincerity and \\"guilelessness\\" of Wood's film, \\"In this respect, the game attains a degree of cheapness that even the movie didn't reach, which is quite an accomplishment\\". The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #190 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

Located on the edge of the Kilpatrick Hills in the northeast of Dumbarton, Bellsmyre is one of five predominantly council housing schemes in Dumbarton, the other four being Westcliff, Silverton, Brucehill and Castlehill. The estate was originally masterplanned by the architect Ninian Johnston of Boswell, Mitchell & Johnston. The first streets were built in the late 1940s, i.e. Aitkenbar Circle, Bellsmyre Avenue, Carman View and Lomond Drive. The original houses in Bellsmyre are recognisable as they are British Iron and Steel Federation houses The scheme was expanded by the Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA) in the 1950s as a municipal housing estate, with many residents moving from the city of Glasgow as part of the \\"overspill\\" programme of moving people from inner city districts to new towns and other areas outwith the city boundaries. Much of the remaining publicly owned housing under landlord Scottish Homes was transferred to the Bellsmyre Housing Association in 1992. There are two later built areas adjacent to Bellsmyre; Stoneyflatt and Glenside, of which Stoneyflatt has been almost totally demolished to make way for new mixed tenure housing. There are also two primary schools in the area, namely Aitkenbar and St Peter's. St Peter's Roman Catholic Church in Bellsmyre was designed by Garner, Preston & Strebel and opened in 1971, winning a RIBA award in 1973. In 2002, Bellsmyre was selected as the pilot area for a Scottish Executive digital inclusion project, which entailed the free provision of home computers with internet access to all households in the area.

Its area is , the average elevation is about , and the highest point is . Politically, it is a district (kecamatan) of the North Bengkulu Regency of the Indonesian province of Bengkulu. The three largest towns on the island are Barhau, Kabuwe and Kayaapu. According to the Indonesian Kantor Statistik for Bengkulu, the island had 1420 inhabitants in 1989.Kantor Sensus & Statistik Propinsi Bengkulu 1989 This number rises, according to the Pukesmas, to 1635 by 1994, with 64% of the population claiming descent from the Engganese people.Enggano by Pieter J. Ter Keurs Villages Enggano female dancers There are six villages on Enggano Island, which are all located on the island's only main road, which traverses the island's northeast coast (Yoder 2011:6).http://arts-sciences.und.edu/summer-institute-of- linguistics/theses/_files/docs/2011-yoder-brendon-e.pdf *Kayaapu *Kaana *Malakoni *Apoho *Meok *Banjarsari Malakoni, Apoho, and Meok have more Enggano natives, and the other villages have larger immigrant populations. There are ferries to Bengkulu from Kahayapu and Malakoni (Yoder 2011:6). A small island just across from Kahyapu is named 'Pulau Dua' (second island). On Pulau Dua there is only one place to spend the night. History The name of the island suggests some early contact with Portuguese traders (engano means mistake), but the earliest published account is that of Cornelis de Houtman, dating from June 5, 1596, who was unable to land a boat. In 1771, Charles Miller succeeded in landing and meeting the indigenous population.An Account of the Island of Sumatra, &c.; By Mr. Charles Miller.Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 68 (1778), pp. 160–179 > With great difficulty and danger we beat up the whole South-west side of it, > without finding any place where we could attempt to land; and we lost two > anchors and had very near suffered shipwreck before we found a secure place > into which we might run the vessel.

Enggano Island map Italian explorer Elio Modigliani visited Enggano Island between April 25 and July 13, 1891. He detailed the apparently dominant role of women in Enggano culture in L'Isola delle Donne (The Island of Women), first published in 1894.Modigliani, E. 1894. L'Isola delle Donne. Ulrico Hoepli, Milano. The Rijksmuseum has an important collection of Enggano artifacts and their publication by Pieter J.ter Keurs reproduces Modigliani's drawings. The population went into severe decline in the 1870s, possibly from disease. The Dutch sent medical officers to investigate. Since the island's highest point is only above sea level, it would have been severely affected by the tsunami associated with the Krakatoa eruption in 1883, as well as by the massive volcanic debris.Indies Explorer, Part III, by Gideon Malherbe The indigenous population never recovered and numbered only about 400 souls in the early 1960s. Therefore, the Indonesian government uses the island for rehabilitation of juvenile offenders from Java, who perform forced labor, clearing bush and constructing rice fields. As noted above, the population has recovered somewhat since that time. The 7.9 Enggano earthquake shook southwestern Sumatra with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). One- hundred and three people were killed and 2,174–2,585 were injured. Spaceport plans The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) has proposed the island for use as a spaceport, citing its \\"low population and remoteness\\" as decisive criteria, as well as its closeness to the equator. The regional government immediately protested the plan as environmentally problematic. In February 2011, a plan to conduct an environmental impact study was announced, chiefly surveying avian populations. Enggano language The Enggano language, also known as Engganese, is either a lexically highly divergent Austronesian (specifically Malayo-Polynesian) language not closely related to any other, or alternatively may be a language isolateEthnologue entry on Enggano with Austronesian loans. Flora and fauna There are a number of plant and animal species endemic to the island.

The Slovak part of Czechoslovakia declared independence with German support one day before the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia. The Slovak Republic controlled the majority of the territory of present-day Slovakia but without its current southern and eastern parts, which were ceded to Hungary in 1938 and 1939. It was the first time in history that Slovakia had been a formally independent state. A one-party state governed by the far-right Hlinka's Slovak People's Party, the Slovak Republic is primarily known for its collaboration with Nazi Germany, which included sending troops to the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. In 1942, the country deported 58,000 Jews (two- thirds of the Slovak Jewish population) to German-occupied Poland, paying Germany 500 Reichsmarks each. After an increase in the activity of anti-Nazi Slovak partisans, Germany invaded Slovakia, triggering a major uprising. The Slovak Republic was abolished after the Soviet occupation in 1945 and its territory was reintegrated into the recreated Third Czechoslovak Republic. The current Slovak Republic does not consider itself a successor state of the wartime Slovak Republic, instead tracing its lineage to the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. However, some nationalists continue to celebrate 14 March as a day of independence. Name The official name of the country was the Slovak State (Slovak: Slovenský štát) from 14 March to 21 July 1939 (until the adoption of the Constitution), and the Slovak Republic (Slovak: Slovenská republika) from 21 July 1939 to its end in April 1945. The country is often referred to historically as the First Slovak Republic (Slovak: prvá Slovenská republika) to distinguish it from the contemporary (Second) Slovak Republic, Slovakia, which is not considered its legal successor state. The name \\"Slovak State\\" was used colloquially, but the term \\"First Slovak Republic\\" was used even in encyclopedias written during post-war Communist period.Vladár, J. (Ed.), Encyklopédia Slovenska V. zväzok R – Š. Bratislava, Veda, 1981, pp. 330–331Plevza, V. (Ed.) Dejiny Slovenského národného povstania 1944 5. zväzok. Bratislava, Nakladateľstvo Pravda, 1985, pp. 484–487 Creation Jozef Tiso (center) at a ceremony for the second anniversary of 14 March 1939 After the Munich Agreement, Slovakia gained autonomy inside Czecho-Slovakia (as the former Czechoslovakia had been renamed) and lost its southern territories to Hungary under the First Vienna Award. As the Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler was preparing a mobilisation into Czech territory and creation of his Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, he had various plans for Slovakia. German officials were initially misinformed by the Hungarians that the Slovaks wanted to join Hungary. Germany decided to make Slovakia a separate puppet state under the influence of Germany, and a potential strategic base for German attacks on Poland and other regions. On 13 March 1939, Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso (the Slovak ex-prime minister who had been deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier) to Berlin and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would have no interest in Slovakia's fate and would leave it to the territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, Joachim von Ribbentrop passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament (\\"Diet of the Slovak Land\\") which would approve Slovakia's independence. On 14 March, the Slovak parliament convened and heard Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler as well as on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of making such a move, among other reasons due to the fact that some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong Hungarian minority. The debate was quickly brought to a head when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state. The request was readily accepted.William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990) Slovak militaryWar with Hungary= On 23 March 1939, Hungary, having already occupied Carpatho-Ukraine, attacked from there, and the newly established Slovak Republic was forced to cede of territory with about 70,000 people to Hungary before the onset of World War II. =Slovak forces during the campaign against Poland (1939)= Slovak soldiers in Poland Slovakia was the only Axis nation other than Germany to take part in the Polish Campaign. With the impending German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile combat group consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of combat engineers, all commanded by Antonín Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Malár. The two groups reported to the headquarters of the 1st and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions. The two combat groups fought while pushing through the Nowy Sącz and Dukla Mountain Passes, advancing towards Dębica and Tarnów in the region of southern Poland. =Slovak forces during the campaign against the Soviet Union= Slovak soldiers force Red Army soldiers to surrender The Slovak military participated in the war on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the German attack. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the German 17th Army (as was the Hungarian Carpathian Group also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the Battle of Uman. At the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a security division, but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the Caucasus area with Army Group B. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the Kuban bridgehead, then being badly mangled near Melitopol in southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason. =Slovak National Uprising= Situation map in first days of Slovak National Uprising In the 1944 Slovak National Uprising, many Slovak units sided with the Slovak resistance and rebelled against Tiso's collaborationist government, while others helped German forces put the uprising down. International relations Croatia, Karel Murgaš (in the middle) with Croatian Poglavnik Ante Pavelić and Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković From the beginning, the Slovak Republic was under the influence of Germany. The so-called \\"protection treaty\\" (Treaty on the protective relationship between Germany and the Slovak State), signed on 23 March 1939, partially subordinated its foreign, military, and economic policy to that of Germany. The German Wehrmacht established the so-called \\"protection zone\\" in Western Slovakia in August 1939. In July 1940 at the Salzburg Conference, the Germans forced a reshuffle of the Slovak cabinet by threatening to withdraw their protection guarantees. The Slovak-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was signed at Moscow on 6 December 1940.National Archives, document reference FO 371/24856 The most difficult foreign policy problem of the state involved relations with Hungary, which had annexed one third of Slovakia's territory by the First Vienna Award of 2 November 1938. Slovakia tried to achieve a revision of the Vienna Award, but Germany did not allow it. There were also constant quarrels concerning Hungary's treatment of Slovaks living in Hungary. Following Slovak participation in the Axis invasion of Poland in September 1939, border adjustments increased the Slovak Republic's geographical extent in the areas of Orava and Spiš, absorbing previously Polish-controlled territory. Characteristics Territorial changes of Slovak Republic from 1938 to 1947 (Red indicating areas which became a part of Hungary, due to the First Vienna Award. Changes on border with Poland are missing) 2.6 million people lived within the 1939 borders of the Slovak State, and 85 percent had declared Slovak nationality on the 1938 census. Minorities included Germans (4.8 percent), Czechs (2.9 percent), Rusyns (2.6 percent), Hungarians (2.1 percent), Jews (1.1 percent), and Romani people (0.9 percent). Seventy-five percent of Slovaks were Catholics, and most of the remainder belonged to the Lutheran and Greek Catholic churches. 50% of the population were employed in agriculture. The state was divided in six counties (župy), 58 districts (okresy) and 2659 municipalities. The capital Bratislava had over 140,000 inhabitants. The state continued the legal system of Czechoslovakia, which was modified only gradually. According to the Constitution of 1939, the \\"President\\" (Jozef Tiso) was the head of the state, the \\"Assembly/Diet of the Slovak Republic\\" elected for five years was the highest legislative body (no general elections took place, however), and the \\"State Council\\" performed the duties of a senate. The government with eight ministries was the executive body. The Slovak Republic was an authoritarian state where the German pressure resulted in the adoption of many elements of German Nazism. Some historians characterized the Slovak regime from 1939 to 1945 as clerical fascism. The government issued a number of antisemitic laws, prohibiting the Jews from participation in public life, and later supported their deportation to concentration camps erected by Germany on Polish territory. The only political parties permitted were the dominant Hlinka's Slovak People's Party and two smaller openly fascist parties, these being the Hungarian National Party which represented the Hungarian minority and the German Party which represented the German minority. Administrative divisions The Slovak Republic in 1944 The Slovak Republic was divided into 6 counties and 58 districts as of 1 January 1940. The extant population records are from the same time: # Bratislava county (Bratislavská župa), 3,667 km², with 455,728 inhabitants, and 6 districts: Bratislava, Malacky, Modra, Senica, Skalica, and Trnava. # Nitra county (Nitrianska župa), 3,546 km², with 335,343 inhabitants, and 5 districts: Hlohovec, Nitra, Prievidza, Topoľčany, and Zlaté Moravce. # Trenčín county (Trenčianska župa), 5,592 km², with 516,698 inhabitants, and 12 districts: Bánovce nad Bebravou, Čadca, Ilava, Kysucké Nové Mesto, Myjava, Nové Mesto nad Váhom, Piešťany, Považská Bystrica, Púchov, Trenčín, Veľká Bytča, and Žilina. # Tatra county (Tatranská župa), 9,222 km², with 463,286 inhabitants, and 13 districts: Dolný Kubín, Gelnica, Kežmarok, Levoča, Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, Námestovo, Poprad, Ružomberok, Spišská Nová Ves, Spišská Stará Ves, Stará Ľubovňa, Trstená, and Turčiansky Svätý Martin. # Šariš-Zemplín county (Šarišsko-zemplínska župa), 7,390 km², with 440,372 inhabitants, and 10 districts: Bardejov, Giraltovce, Humenné, Medzilaborce, Michalovce, Prešov, Sabinov, Stropkov, Trebišov, and Vranov nad Topľou. # Hron county (Pohronská župa), 8,587 km², with 443,626 inhabitants, and 12 districts: Banská Bystrica, Banská Štiavnica, Brezno nad Hronom, Dobšiná, Hnúšťa, Kremnica, Krupina, Lovinobaňa, Modrý Kameň, Nová Baňa, Revúca, and Zvolen. The Holocaust upright=1.2 Soon after independence and along with the mass exile and deportation of Czechs, the Slovak Republic began a series of measures aimed against the Jews in the country. The Hlinka's Guard began to attack Jews, and the \\"Jewish Code\\" was passed in September 1941. Resembling the Nuremberg Laws, the code required Jews to wear a yellow armband, and banned them from intermarriage and from many jobs. By October 1941, 15,000 Jews were expelled from Bratislava; many were sent to labour camps. The Slovak Republic was one of the countries to agree to deport its Jews as part of the Nazi Final Solution. Originally, the Slovak government tried to make a deal with Germany in October 1941 to deport its Jews as a substitute for providing Slovak workers to help the war effort. After the Wannsee Conference, the Germans agreed to the Slovak proposal, and a deal was reached where the Slovak Republic would pay for each Jew deported, and, in return, Germany promised that the Jews would never return to the republic. The initial terms were for \\"20,000 young, strong Jews\\", but the Slovak government quickly agreed to a German proposal to deport the entire population for \\"evacuation to territories in the East\\" meaning to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The deportations of Jews from Slovakia started on 25 March 1942, but halted on 20 October 1942 after a group of Jewish citizens, led by Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Ber Weissmandl, built a coalition of concerned officials from the Vatican and the government, and, through a mix of bribery and negotiation, was able to stop the process. By then, however, some 58,000 Jews had already been deported, mostly to Auschwitz. Slovak government officials filed complaints against Germany, when it became clear that many of the previously deported Slovak Jews had been gassed in mass executions. Jewish deportations resumed on 30 September 1944, when the Soviet army reached the Slovak border, and the Slovak National Uprising took place. As a result of these events, Germany decided to occupy all of Slovakia and the country lost its independence. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported and 5,000 were imprisoned. Deportations continued until 31 March 1945. In all, German and Slovak authorities deported about 70,000 Jews from Slovakia; about 65,000 of them were murdered or died in concentration camps. The overall figures are inexact, partly because many Jews did not identify themselves, but one 2006 estimate is that approximately 105,000 Slovak Jews, or 77% of their pre-war population, died during the war. SS plans for Slovakia Although the official policy of the Nazi regime was in favour of an independent Slovak state dependent on Germany and opposed to any annexations of Slovak territory, Heinrich Himmler's SS considered ambitious population policy options concerning the German minority of Slovakia, which numbered circa 130,000 people.Longerich, P. (2008), Heinrich Himmler, p. 458, In 1940, Günther Pancke, head of the SS RuSHA (\\"Race and Settlement Office\\") undertook a study trip in Slovak lands where ethnic Germans were present, and reported to Himmler that the Slovak Germans were in danger of disappearing. Pancke recommended that action should be taken to fuse the racially valuable part of the Slovaks into the German minority and remove the Gypsy and Jewish populations. He stated that this would be possible by \\"excluding\\" the Hungarian minority of the country, and by settling some 100,000 ethnic German families to Slovakia. The racial core of this Germanization policy was to be gained from the Hlinka Guard, which was to be further integrated into the SS in the near future.

The German troops were gradually pushed out by the Red Army, by Romanian and by Czechoslovak troops coming from the east. The liberated territories became de facto part of Czechoslovakia again. The First Slovak Republic ceased to exist de facto on 4 April 1945 when the Red Army captured Bratislava and occupied all of Slovakia. De jure it ceased to exist when the exiled Slovak government capitulated to General Walton Walker leading the XX Corps of the 3rd US Army on 8 May 1945 in the Austrian town of Kremsmünster. In summer 1945, the captured former president and members of former government were handed over to Czechoslovak authorities. Several prominent Slovak politicians escaped to neutral countries. Following his captivity, the deposed president Jozef Tiso authorized the former foreign minister Ferdinand Ďurčanský as his successor. Ďurčanský, Tiso's personal secretary Karol Murín, and cousin Fraňo Tiso were appointed by ex-president Tiso as the representatives of the Slovak nation, however they failed to create a government-in-exile as no country recognized them. In the 1950s with fellow Slovak nationalist they established Slovak Action Committee (later Slovak Liberation Committee) which unsuccessfully advocated the restoration of the independent Slovak State and the renewal of war against the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the creation of the Slovak republic, the Slovak Liberation Committee proclaimed Tiso's authorization as obsolete. Legacy Some Slovak nationalists, such as the Kotleba party, celebrate 14 March as the anniversary of Slovak independence, although 1 January (the date of the Velvet Divorce) is the official independence day. The issue of 14 March commemorations divided the Christian Democratic Movement in the early 1990s.

He started his professional career with Espanyol, going on to amass La Liga totals of 168 games and 25 goals over eight seasons, also representing in the competition Alavés, Murcia and Celta. He added 268 matches and 53 goals in Segunda División, where he played for all the clubs except his first. De Lucas had two spells abroad, including the 2002–03 campaign with Chelsea. Club career Born in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, de Lucas came through the academy of RCD Espanyol, making his first-team debut on 15 May 1998 away against Real Valladolid (his sole appearance of the season) and being promoted to the main squad immediately afterwards. Subsequently, he became an important attacking element for the Pericos, appearing in 30 La Liga matches and scoring four goals in 1999–2000 while helping the club to that year's Copa del Rey. After his contract expired in 2002, and after an unassuming loan spell at Paris Saint-Germain F.C. the previous year, de Lucas joined Chelsea on a four- year deal, being relatively used in his first and only season. His sole goal for the English team was a well-executed chip in the UEFA Cup against Viking FK, in a 2–1 home win but 4–5 loss on aggregate. De Lucas then returned to Spain, having a huge impact at Deportivo Alavés, although most of his stint was spent in the second division. He netted six times from 40 appearances as the Basque side returned to the top level after two years, being immediately relegated the following campaign. After another season in division two, de Lucas became Real Murcia's first signing after it achieved a top-flight return in 2007, agreeing on a two-year contract. He featured heavily in his first year, notably scoring in a 1–1 home draw against Real Madrid, but the club returned to the second tier. In August 2009, de Lucas had a trial with Football League Championship's Blackpool after his Murcia link had expired, alongside Will Haining and Ishmel Demontagnac. A deal did not materialise, and he signed with FC Cartagena – recently returned to the second division – shortly after; he scored the first goal of the new campaign, a 1–0 victory at Girona FC. In late June 2010, after nearly helping Cartagena to another promotion (fifth place, with chances of promotion until the last two rounds) while scoring a career-best 11 goals, de Lucas moved to RC Celta de Vigo. He produced the same individual numbers in his first two years – 37 games, nine goals – helping the Galicians promote to the top level in 2012 as runners-up. After suffering relegation from the second tier, with Hércules CF, de Lucas retired from football at the age of 35. In February 2015, however, he returned to active, joining English amateurs Biggleswade United. International career De Lucas made four appearances for the Spain under-21 side, in a one- year span.

During the 1960s, Pan Pacific promoted many concert and theatrical tours of Australia and New Zealand, including Louis Armstrong, Arthur Rubinstein, Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys. During the mid-1960s Pan Pacific was in stiff competition in the pop tour market with rival promoter, Aztec Services Ltd, headed by veteran promoter Kenn Brodziak, but by the late 1960s Miller and Brodziak had become friends and colleagues and subsequently collaborated on many concert and theatrical promotions. During this period Miller also expanded into personal management; his first client was pioneering TV chef Graham Kerr, already a household name in New Zealand, who became a national TV star in Australia before launching a very successful international career. In 1969, Miller discovered 16-year-old American singer Marcia Hines in Boston, Massachusetts, while casting African- American performers for the Australian stage version of Hair, which he was producing. Hines flew to Australia, unaware that she was already six months pregnant, and Miller acted as her legal guardian in Australia until she turned 21.Marcia Hines. George Negus Tonight. ABC. 14 October 2004. Archived from the original on 1 February 2005. Miller went on to produce the Australian productions of Jesus Christ Superstar in 1972 and The Rocky Horror Show in 1974, both of which used many of the production staff from Hair including director Jim Sharman. In 1970, Miller joined the council of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and was elected chairman of the gallery's society. Computicket and fraud charges In 1978, Miller started a ticketing company called Computicket, which went into receivership within six months. On 30 April 1982, Miller was found guilty of aiding and abetting the misappropriation of $728,000 in funds and sentenced to three years in jail. The verdict led to the collapse of the company, and he served ten months in prison at Long Bay and Cessnock Correctional Centres. Celebrity agent and manager Miller was the founder and director of the Harry M. Miller Group, based in Moore Park, Sydney. His agency represented a varied client base of well-known figures in Australia including all contestants on Big Brother, Lindy Chamberlain, Stuart Diver (the only survivor of the 1997 Thredbo landslide), Judy Moran (wife of slain Melbourne underworld figure Lewis Moran), and Gai Waterhouse (a horse racing trainer). Miller gave advice and managed communication, negotiations and media attention surrounding individuals or companies that found themselves under intense public spotlight. Death Miller died at age 84 in Sydney, Australia, on 4 July 2018, after a vascular dementia diagnosis in 2011. He died with his long-term partner Simmone Logue, daughters Justine, Brook and Lauren, and their mother Wendy by his side. ReferencesExternal links *Harry M.

The school is coeducational and educates over 1,000 children aged 9 months to 18 years. It was founded by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in 1748, and is the world's oldest Methodist educational institution. It was established to provide an education for the sons of Methodist clergymen. It owns the Kingswood Preparatory School, the Upper and Middle Playing Fields and other buildings. History Kingswood School was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood (then known as King's Wood) near Bristol and was established initially for the children of local colliers. They were joined by the sons of the itinerant ministers (clergy) of the Methodist Church. After Wesley's death, Rev Joseph Bradford was appointed as the first governor in 1795. Woodhouse Grove School was founded in 1812 and was linked with Kingswood as a prep school for much of the nineteenth century. Created in 1995, Kingswood Prep School currently has 300 pupils. The total number of students educated on the Kingswood School campus between the ages of 9 months -18 is 960. The 1862 book How it was done at Stow School written by Theophilus Woolmer seems to have been based upon the author's own experiences at Kingswood (rather than Stowe School which was not yet established) under the notorious headmaster Crowther who enforced harsh discipline in the school in the 1820s. The school moved to its present location on the northern slopes of Bath in 1851. The old site was occupied for a while by an approved school. The present site is in the midst of of the former Lansdown estate of the famous nineteenth-century millionaire eccentric, William Thomas Beckford. The Upper Playing Fields, comprising some 57 acres, are to the north of the senior school and include an athletics track and tennis and netball courts. Sons of lay people were first admitted to the school in 1922. During World War II the Kingswood buildings were requisitioned by the government and used by the Admiralty for military planning purposes. The school was evacuated to Uppingham School and continued to function there. The Mulberry harbours used on D-day for the landing on the Normandy beaches were designed at the school and for many years it was thought that they were named after the Mulberry tree that still exists outside the front of the school, whereas Mulberry was simply the next code word on a list. The Moulton Hall was named after ex-pupil Lord Moulton but was remodelled as a library/learning resources area in 2006, and is now called the J O Heap library following a generous bequest from another ex-pupil. During World War II the younger boys were moved to Prior's Court, an estate owned by Colonel Gerald Palmer, MP for Winchester. After the war the estate was purchased from Colonel Palmer and run as a Preparatory School until it was sold in 1997. A small number of boys (around six) started in the Junior house (Westwood) before the war, moved to Prior's Court on the outbreak of war, on to Uppingham and finally back to Kingswood at the war's end. In memory of the event a stone was taken from the Kingswood library, engraved and set in the Uppingham buildings. An Uppingham stone was likewise sent to Kingswood and incorporated in the library wall. The inscriptions on the stones are shown in the accompanying boxes. Some girls were admitted to the Bristol site in the early days before the school became boarding only. Girls were admitted to the school in its current form from 1972. Organisation Kingswood pupils are divided into Boarding Houses for both living convenience and sporting competitiveness. Each boys house is paired with a girls house (Upper with School, Hall with Fonthill and Middle with Summerhill). This is mainly for social events and unisex sports fixtures (e.g. sports day). Pupils are sorted into one of six houses in Year 9: Boys * Upper (day boys), house colours are yellow and black. * Middle (day and boarding boys), house colours are green and white. * Hall (day and boarding boys), house colour is maroon. Girls * School (day girls and sixth form girl boarders), house colours are yellow and pink. * Summerhill (day and boarding girls), house colour is blue. * Fonthill (day and boarding girls), house colour is red. Junior House * Westwood (day and boarding for boys & girls in years 7 and 8), the largest house with approximately 170-day children and 30 boarders. Chapel attendance is compulsory at least once a week. Sport Kingswood has a reputation for encouraging sports, with boys playing rugby, hockey and cricket (boys also do tennis, cross country and athletics) and girls playing hockey, netball and tennis (girls also do rounders and athletics). Kingswood competes with all other public schools in Somerset and most students consider King Edward's School, Bath and Prior Park College as their main rivals due to their close proximity and history of rivalry. Sporting achievements within the school are awarded by the presentation of \\"Colours\\", first by a special tie and then a special blazer.  Music  Kingswood School also has a Music Department, providing students with the opportunity to be part of numerous choirs, orchestras, bands and ensembles, including Westwood Voices, Westwood Orchestra, Senior Choir, Chamber Choir, Westwood Orchestra, Brass Ensemble, String Group and Clarinet Group. The school Jazz Band, \\"KJO\\" (Kingswood Jazz Orchestra), performs on the first night of Bath International Music Festival in Bath's Green Park Station. Visiting music teachers offer tuition in a range of instruments, and the school provides opportunities for pupils to perform individually in regular informal lunchtime and teatime concerts, as well as in ensembles in the larger Christmas and Spring Concerts. The school also has 15-20 music scholars who contribute to the musical life of the school and perform in an annual concert in January. Kingswood Theatre Used by the school during term time and available for hire during school holidays, Kingswood Theatre is on the site of the senior school. The theatre was officially opened in 1994 by Sir Edward Heath and completed a partial refurbishment in 2010. The theatre has 366 seats with a capacity of 450. The theatre has been used by BBC Question Time on a number of occasions. The chapel Model United Nations Kingswood hosts an annual Model United Nations conference, known as the Bath International Schools Model United Nations (BISMUN). Delegates attend from schools worldwide. Eco-schools The School has implemented a number of projects to promote the importance of the environment and reduce waste at the school. Kingswood was one of the first schools in the area to adopt the Eco-schools project and be awarded its Green Flag. It has since begun outreach work with other local schools, including Batheaston Junior School. The school was awarded its third Green Flag in 2010. Kingswood-Oxford School George Nicholson, an alumnus of Kingswood School, Bath, established a school for boys of the same name in West Hartford, Connecticut in 1916. This new institution inherited some of the traditions of its counterpart in Bath, including the School's crest, motto, colors and distinctive symbol, the Wyvern. In 1969 the school merged with the Oxford School for girls into the new Kingswood-Oxford School. Kingswood College, Grahamstown Kingswood College in Grahamstown, South Africa, was founded in 1894 and derives its name and ideals from Kingswood school in Bath. They also use the same distinctive Wyvern crest and abide by the same Methodist ethos. Notable alumni :See also :Category:People educated at Kingswood School, Bath.

Herman was one of the most noted power hitters of the late 1920s and early 1930s, and hit for the cycle a record three times; his .532 career slugging percentage ranked fourth among hitters with at least 5000 at bats in the National League when he retired. His .393 batting average, .678 slugging percentage, 241 hits and 416 total bases in 1930 remain Dodgers franchise records, with his 143 runs being the post-1900 team record; he also set team records (since broken) that year with 35 home runs and 130 runs batted in. He was also renowned for his various misadventures as a defensive player and baserunner, which earned him derision – and eventually affection – among fans. Career Born in Buffalo, New York and raised in Glendale, California, Herman signed with a minor league team in Edmonton, Alberta at age 18, and spent five years playing for six different teams, including tours in the farm systems of the Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers. In a 1922 spring training game, he was used as a pinch hitter for Ty Cobb; but the Tigers, with no outfield vacancies, returned him to the minors, where he hit .416. He was signed for Brooklyn in 1925 by a scout who said of him, \\"He's kind of funny in the field, but when I see a guy go 6-for-6, I've got to go for him.\\" He made his major league debut as a first baseman with the Brooklyn Robins in 1926, hitting .319 as a rookie; he finished fourth in the National League in doubles (35), and seventh in home runs (11) and slugging (.500). In 1928 he placed fifth in the National League with a .340 batting mark. He enjoyed an outstanding year in 1929, setting team records with a .381 batting average and a .612 slugging average (breaking club marks of .379 by Willie Keeler and .588 by Jack Fournier) while collecting 217 hits, 105 runs and 113 runs batted in (RBIs); but the National League was in the middle of an offensive explosion, and he finished behind Lefty O'Doul (.398) for the batting title and was only seventh in the league in slugging. He had two doubles and two triples on June 5, and came in eighth in the 1929 MVP voting. He followed up with his most spectacular year by improving his own batting and slugging records, with his .393 batting average again placing second in the league behind Bill Terry, who hit .401 – as of 2018, the last .400 season in the NL. Herman was also third in the National League in slugging, behind Hack Wilson and Chuck Klein; the league as a whole batted .303 in 1930, and while Herman's 241 hits were only third in the National League behind Terry and Klein, it was then the fifth highest total ever in the league. Herman broke Fournier's 1924 club record of 27 home runs, and tied his 1925 total of 130 RBIs. Gil Hodges broke his team record of 40 home runs in 1951, and Roy Campanella posted 142 runs batted in during 1953; Duke Snider was the first left-handed Dodger to break Herman's home run and runs batted in records. There was no MVP award given in 1930. Herman was an outstanding hitter, but a markedly below-average fielder who led the National League in errors in 1927 as a first baseman and in each of the next two years playing in right field. Fresco Thompson, a 1931 teammate, observed: \\"He wore a glove for one reason: because it was a league custom.\\" Herman developed a self-deprecating attitude about his shortcomings; when informed by a local bank that someone had been impersonating him and cashing bad checks, he said, \\"Hit him a few flyballs. If he catches any, it ain't me.\\" His style of play, along with that of the entire team, led to Brooklyn being dubbed \\"The Daffiness Boys\\", with sportswriter Frank Graham noting, \\"They were not normally of a clownish nature, and some of them were very good ballplayers, indeed, but they were overcome by the atmosphere in which they found themselves as soon as they had put on Brooklyn uniforms.\\" In the seventh inning of a game on August 15, 1926 against the Boston Braves at Ebbets Field, Herman tried to stretch a double off the right field wall into a triple with one out and the bases loaded. Chick Fewster, who had been on first base, advanced to third base – which was already occupied by Dazzy Vance, who had started on second base but became caught in a rundown between third and home and was dashing back to third. All three men ended up on third base, with Herman not having watched the play in front of him. The Braves' third baseman, Eddie Taylor, tagged all three just to be sure of getting as many outs as possible. The slow-footed Vance had been a major contributor to the situation, but according to the rules, because he was the lead runner and not forced to advance, he was entitled to third base, so umpire Beans Reardon called Herman and Fewster out. Thus, Herman \\"doubled into a double play,\\" although Hank DeBerry also scored the game's winning run on the play before the daffiness started. Herman later complained that no one remembered that he drove in the winning run on the play. The incident led to the popular joke: *\\"The Dodgers have three men on base!\\" *\\"Oh, yeah? Which base?\\" On two occasions in 1930 – May 30 and September 15 – Herman stopped to watch a home run while running the bases and was passed by the hitter, in each case causing the home run to count only as a single. And on September 20 of the following year, he was thrown out trying to steal a base against the St. Louis Cardinals, even though opposing catcher was 48-year-old Cardinals manager Gabby Street, appearing in his first game (as an emergency substitute) since 1912. Pitcher Vance dubbed him \\"the Headless Horseman of Ebbets Field\\" for his various mistakes. In 1931 Herman \\"slipped\\" to a .313 average, and although he led the National League with 77 extra base hits, was third in total bases, and hit for the cycle on both May 18 and July 24, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds before the 1932 season. He bounced back with a solid year, leading the National League with 19 triples and tying Sam Crawford's 1901 Reds' team record for left-handed hitters of 16 home runs, which was broken in 1936 by Ival Goodman with 17. Herman played for the Chicago Cubs in 1933–34, batting .304 in the latter season. On July 20, 1933 he hit three home runs, and on September 30 he hit for the cycle for the third time, a feat only he and Bob Meusel accomplished in the 20th century. (In 2015, Adrián Beltré also hit for the cycle a third time). After a brief stint with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1935, he was traded back to the Reds, staying with them through 1936. On July 10, 1935, he hit the first home run ever in a major league night game. He played briefly for the Tigers in 1937, hitting .300 in 17 games, and then returned to the minor leagues. Nine years later in 1945, he was re-signed by Brooklyn at age 42, and played his 37 final big league games with the team. He received a strong ovation from the Ebbets Field crowd in his first turn at bat, and tripped over first base after hitting a single. After retiring, he worked as a scout for several teams until 1964. Herman ended his major league career with a .324 batting average, 1818 hits, 181 home runs, 997 RBIs, 882 runs, 399 doubles, 110 triples and 94 stolen bases in 1552 games. Herman hit better than .300 in nine major league seasons. His son was a mathematics teacher at Herbert Hoover High School, the cross-town rival of Babe's high school Glendale High School, from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Herman was among the subjects interviewed for the 1966 book The Glory of Their Times. He died in Glendale, California at age 84 following a bout with pneumonia and a series of strokes. He is interred there in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

She is a trained nurse, midwife and health visitor and has worked for the National Health Service her entire working life. Methods Percy attended the Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford in the late 1980s. As an activist, she uses non-violent direct action and civil disobedience.

In June 1994, the newspapers reported that a series of meetings took place between representatives of the US and British governments \\"to discuss continuing incursions at US bases and how to deal with on-going US military concerns\\", as a result of Percy's persistent incursions into American and British bases and her campaigns in general. The campaign against the Menwith Hill base was documented by Duncan Campbell in the Channel 4 documentary The Hill. Policy Influence In 2001, Percy submitted a memorandum to the House of Commons about an expansion of jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP), which she opposed on several grounds, including what she denoted as an \\"extension of the jurisdiction of the MDP into areas not naturally within their stated role\\", thus essentially exposing \\"the citizen .... to a police force\\".\\"Appendix 19: Memorandum submitted by Lindis Percy\\", Select Committee on Armed Forces, House of PCommons, March 2001 In 2002, Percy submitted for information held about her by the government under the Data Protection Act 1998.

It was set in a fictional working men's club in the North of England and was hosted by comedian Colin Crompton as the club's chairman. The show's compere was usually Bernard Manning, who as well as telling jokes and introducing acts often finished the show with a song. Crompton was frequently the butt of his jokes, acting as Manning's stooge. The set was arranged like a club, so that rather than members of the studio audience being in arranged terraced seating they would be seated around tables and be served beer and snacks, generally join in a singalong and otherwise engage in audience participation. Crompton as Chairman of the club would sit at a small table in the corner watching proceedings with apparent lack of interest. He had a large manual fire bell which he would wind and sound purportedly to attract the audience's attention after an act, with various notices from \\"the Committee\\" (that is, the officials of the social club of which he was chairman), usually misdemeanours by the club's members or the committee itself: On New Year's Eve a special episode of Wheeltappers and Shunters New Year's Eve would be broadcast. Acts The show featured acts regularly seen on the Northern club circuits and often well-established performers who did well in theatres and clubs but not succeed so well on British television, such as 1950s crooner Johnnie Ray. But it also gave newer acts their first television exposure, such as Cannon & Ball, the Grumbleweeds, the Dooleys and Paul Daniels. Some artists to appear on the show were: * Winifred Atwell * Alvin Stardust * The Bachelors * Bill Haley and the Comets * The Dubliners * Jim Bowen * Frank Carson * David Copperfield * Design * Stuart Damon * The Three Degrees * Lonnie Donegan * Karl Denver * Freddie Garrity * Buddy Greco * Kathy Kirby * The Krankies * Susan Maughan * George Melly and John Chilton's Feetwarmers * Nana Mouskouri * Roy Orbison * Lyn Paul * Terri Rogers * George Roper * Tessie O'Shea * Malcolm Roberts * The Kaye Sisters * The Dooleys * Gene Pitney The show was produced by Johnnie Hamp at Granada Studios in Manchester, although it was once filmed at the Layton Institute, Blackpool. Actress Elizabeth Dawn appeared as a waitress before she became more famous for her role as Vera Duckworth in Coronation Street (also recorded by Granada in Manchester). A clip from the show can be seen in the film 24 Hour Party People, where Shaun Ryder, in his formative years, is seen watching Karl Denver perform \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" (\\"Wimoweh\\"). The music video to Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds' single \\"Black Star Dancing\\" depicts the band performing on the show. Origins of the name Wheeltappers and shunters are railway workers. They were commonly employed by steam railways in Britain and elsewhere, but still are found both on British railways and in Eastern Europe. Although often called \\"working men's clubs\\", most such clubs admitted the wives and other women family of the working man, at least some days of the week. This is echoed in the programme's audience being as much female as male.

In 1973, Marshallese lawmakers meeting in Saipan at the Congress of Micronesia, the legislative body for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, asserted that \\"Enen-Kio is and always has been the property of the people of the Marshall Islands.\\" Their claim was based on oral legends and songs. \\"EnenKio\\" means \\"Island of the orange flower\\" and comes from the Kio flower that is native to the island.

The Kingdom of EnenKio is not recognized in any international forum as a sovereign state, nor does any internationally recognized state recognize it. In 1997 the Dominion of Melchizedek, a micronation engaged in financial fraud, reported that the two had entered into relations. The Kingdom of EnenKio is characterized as a scam by anti-fraud website Quatloos! In 2000, Robert Moore, who claimed to be the head of state, was prevented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from fraudulently issuing bonds for the non-existent nation.

An amateur, he played as an all-rounder. As a right-handed batsman, Crawford had a reputation for scoring quickly and hitting powerful shots. He bowled medium-paced off spin and was noted for his accuracy and his ability to make the ball turn sharply from the pitch. Unusually for a first- class cricketer, Crawford wore spectacles while playing. Crawford established a reputation as an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played Test cricket for England before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1907–08. He played only 12 matches for England, although critics believed he had a great future in the sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class games. A dispute over the composition of a Surrey side chosen to play a high- profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, he worked as a teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the South Australian Cricket Association over money and moved to New Zealand to play for Otago. That relationship also ended badly, and he left Otago before being conscripted into the New Zealand armed forces near the end of the First World War. When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an average of 20.66. Although he continued to play cricket at a lower level, the remainder of Crawford's life passed in relative obscurity. Early life and career alt=A school viewed through a stone gateway Jack Crawford was born on 1 December 1886 at Cane Hill, Coulsdon, Surrey, the youngest of three sons of the Rev John Charles Crawford and his wife Alice; the couple also had three daughters. Crawford senior was the chaplain at the recently opened Cane Hill Asylum, in the grounds of which Crawford was born.Burns, Chapter 1, Location 100. He grew up in a cricketing environment. His father and uncle, Frank Crawford, played first-class cricket for Kent; his brothers Vivian and Reginald were also first-class cricketers. The whole family played cricket and encouraged Crawford from a young age, and from the age of eleven he regularly played with adults.Burns, Chapter 1, Location 119. After attending Glengrove School in Eastbourne,Burns, Chapter 1, Location 143. Crawford went to St Winifred's School in Henley-on-Thames where, in his two years in the cricket team, he scored 2,093 runs and took 366 wickets. In 1902, Crawford moved to Repton School. Reaching the cricket team in his first year, he remained in the eleven until he left the school in 1905. His impact was considerable. A 1906 report in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack rated him as one of the best three schoolboy cricketers in the previous 40 years, matched only by A. G. Steel and Stanley Jackson.Green, ed (1982), p. 335. Cricket historians similarly praised his cricket at Repton. Benny Green notes that his prolific achievements \\"created ... chaos among schoolboy cricketers.\\"Green (1988), p. 146. Gerald Brodribb describes him as \\"probably the best ever\\" schoolboy cricketer. By 1904, Crawford dominated the Repton team. He scored 759 runs and his 75 wickets were more than the combined total of all the other bowlers in the team. He was particularly effective in the school's most important fixtures. The report in Wisden described him as possibly the best amateur bowler in England that year:Green, ed (1982), pp. 334–35. he bowled medium-paced off spin, although he varied the speed of his delivery from slow to fast. Surrey County Cricket Club took an interest in Crawford almost immediately, calling him to a trial in 1903. Following his achievements in 1904, he was invite to play for the county.Burns, Chapter 1, Location 210. The county club was in the midst of a spell of uncertainty; several men captained the team, but only for a handful of matches each. The composition of the side continually changed, and the team performed poorly, causing unrest among supporters accustomed to success. Crawford was just one of many players brought in as an experiment, albeit one of the most successful.Hart, p. 4. He made his first-class debut against Kent. Taking three wickets and top-scoring in Surrey's first innings with 54, Crawford did well enough to retain his place for another seven games, and was praised in the press for his performances.Burns, Chapter 2, Location 235. Against Gloucestershire, he took seven wickets for 43 runs in the second innings, and a total of ten wickets in the match. In the season as a whole he took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 16.93 to top the county's bowling averages, and scored 229 runs at an average of 16.35. Although hampered by injuries during the 1905 season for Repton, his last at the school, Crawford scored 766 runs with a batting average of 85. In the five matches in which he was fit to bowl he took 55 wickets at an average under 13. In the August holidays, he returned to play for Surrey. In his second game, he took seven for 90 against Yorkshire and in his third, he scored his maiden first-class century—119 not out against Derbyshire—to become the youngest centurion for the county, a record that was not broken until 2013.Burns, Chapter 2, Location 339. Later, he took eight for 24 against Northamptonshire and scored 142 not out against Leicestershire. At the end of the season, he played in the Hastings Festival,Burns, Chapter 2, Location 373. appearing in several representative games for teams representing the South of England and played for the Rest of England against the County Champions Yorkshire. Crawford finished second in Surrey's batting averages for 1905; in all first-class games he scored 543 runs at an average of 33.93 and took 47 wickets at an average of 18.46. As the season ended, he was invited by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to join their tour of South Africa that winter.Burns, Chapter 2, Location 376. International cricketerTour to South Africa= Having finished his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team was not particularly strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side.Wynne-Thomas, p. 59. The MCC was criticised by the press both in England and in South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 392. As the youngest member of the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 398. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 Wisden carried the same story;Burns, Chapter 3, Location 446. in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left South Africa five years before.Hart, p. 6. In all first-class matches on the tour, Crawford scored 531 runs at an average of 31.23, coming third in the tour batting averages, and took 34 wickets at an average of 18.44, placing him fifth among the regular bowlers in the team. In the early tour matches, Crawford recorded two five wicket hauls and scored 98. He made his Test match debut for England against South Africa in the first Test at the age of 19 years and 32 days to become England's youngest Test cricketer, a record he held until Brian Close made his debut in 1949.Hart, p. 7. Batting at number six, Crawford scored 44 runs in the first innings and 43 in the second; he took a wicket with his first delivery, bowling Bert Vogler.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 496. He was wicketless in the second innings, and bowled inaccurately as the home side recorded a one-wicket win.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 503. Wisden noted that Crawford batted well in both innings. After a month of cricket in between the Tests, during which Crawford scored 212 in a minor game, the English team were suffering from fatigue when the remaining matches were played. In the second Test, Crawford was promoted to open the batting, a position he retained for most of the series. In the final match, he scored 74, his first Test fifty and the highest score of his Test career. His best bowling also came in the final match, where he took three for 69. In the Test series, Crawford scored 281 runs at an average of 31.22 and took nine wickets at 35.77. England lost the series 4–1, finding it difficult to bat against the South African googly bowlers. Wisden's tour report described Crawford's batting as one of the few positives for his side. Writing home during the tour, the MCC captain Pelham Warner frequently praised Crawford and the extent of his ability at a young age. The English press even parodied what Crawford's biographer, Michael Burns, describes as Warner's \\"near-obsession\\" with Crawford.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 516. Other critics believed that Crawford should have been more successful as a bowler but was distracted by the matting surfaces used in South Africa; because he was able to make the ball bounce and turn extravagantly from the surface, he tried to spin the ball too much and lost accuracy as a result.Burns, Chapter 3, Location 605. =Surrey cricketer= alt=A cricket match in progress; gasholders are visible in the background Returning to England for the 1906 season, Crawford completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class cricket, the youngest player at the time to accomplish this feat. Against Gloucestershire, he scored 148 and then took seven for 85 and four for 63 with the ball; he also took ten wickets in his next game. In total, he compiled 1,174 runs at an average of 30.10, and took 118 wickets at an average of 20.28. These performances earned him selection for the representative Gentlemen versus Players matches at both Lord's and The Oval, in which he played for the amateur Gentlemen. At the end of the season, he was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation said: \\"Few cricketers have won equal fame at so early an age\\", and noted the unusual ease with which he had moved into first-class cricket. Crawford's powerful batting and straight hitting were praised, as was his accurate bowling. The report also stated: \\"That he should have done all this is the more astonishing from the fact that he invariably plays in glasses. No one handicapped in this way has ever been so consistently successful both as batsman and bowler.\\" Crawford had a reputation by this stage as a batsman who favoured aggressive, powerful shots and his performances drew in crowds. In 1907, in the space of a few days, he hit deliveries in two different matches through the windows of both the home and the visitors' dressing rooms at The Oval. Towards the end of the season, he scored 103 runs in 90 minutes against Kent, his only century that year, hitting several deliveries into the crowd; The Times described the ball in this innings as \\"soaring away like a bird\\". Crawford's overall batting record was similar to the previous season: he scored 1,158 runs at an average of 30.47. With the ball, he took 124 wickets at 16.95, completing his second double. Once again, he was selected in both Gentlemen v Players matches, taking six for 54 in the second, and was chosen to play two of the three Test matches against South Africa. These were his only Test matches in England; he scored 26 runs in three innings and was wicketless after bowling 29 overs. He missed England's victory in the second match, the only match in the series not to be a draw, but Wisden's correspondent believed that the pitch conditions for that game made it a mistake to leave Crawford out. Despite his lack of success in the Tests, Crawford was invited to tour Australia that winter even before the South African series was complete;Burns, Chapter 4, Location 809. he suggested to the press that he might remain in Australia after the tour.Burns, Chapter 4, Location 821. =Tour to Australia= The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907–08, like that which toured South Africa, faced questions about its strength. Because at least four first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than usual for an Ashes series.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 979. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested by the results. Crawford began the tour well, taking seven wickets in the opening first-class match against Western Australia. In the second game, he scored 114 runs in 58 minutes against South Australia, the fastest first-class century scored in Australia until then, followed by bowling figures of five for 40 in the second innings.Green (1988), p. 147. Crawford contributed little more with bat or ball in the lead-up to the Test series; in England, the cricketer Gilbert Jessop wrote an article suggesting that Crawford had become an \\"unsound\\" batsman.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1080. He scarcely bowled in the first Test, won by Australia, and both the English and the Australian press were critical of his bowling.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1146. Frederick Fane, the acting-captain of England, seemed to share this view in the second Test, withholding Crawford from the attack for some time.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1137. However, Crawford took five for 79 in the first innings helped to restrict Australia on a good batting pitch and took eight wickets in the match as England levelled the series. Australia won the remaining games to win the series. In the third match, Crawford scored his only half-century of the series, hitting 62 out of England's 363 to help his team build up a first innings lead. However, Australia scored 506 at the second attempt, during which Crawford bowled nearly 46 overs to take three for 113. The series was settled in the fourth Test; Australia recorded a big victory after rain affected the pitch and created difficult batting conditions during England's first innings. On the first day, Crawford took five for 48, his best Test figures, as Australia were bowled out for 214 on a very good pitch. Wisden noted Crawford \\"[mixed] up his pace with remarkable skill\\". By this stage of the tour, the press looked on him much more favourably, and he received praise for his performances.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1206. However, his heavy workload with the ball affected his health; he lost a stone in weight during the tour, and before the final Test a Melbourne doctor diagnosed that he had \\"strained the right side of his heart\\" and advised that he see a specialist.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1218. Crawford played in that game, won by Australia, despite his ill health, with several other players unfit, and the tour manager later wrote that he looked poorly throughout and should not have played. Nevertheless, he bowled 54 overs and took eight wickets in the match.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 1223. Wisden considered Crawford's bowling to be one of the most successful features of the tour and praised his ability to spin the ball, reporting: \\"It was said of Crawford that even on the most perfect wickets he could at times make the ball break back.\\" He led the English Test bowling averages with 30 wickets at an average of 24.73. His batting was less productive than expected; in five Tests, he scored 162 runs at an average of 18.00, batting usually at number eight. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 610 runs at 26.52 and took 66 wickets at 25.19. Crawford's contributions enhanced his growing reputation and critics expected his cricket to go from strength to strength. Australian batsman Clem Hill commented: \\"There are grand cricketers in this game, and then there is Jack Crawford.\\" The final game in the series turned out to be Crawford's last Test. In 12 Test matches, he had scored 469 runs at an average of 22.33 and took 39 wickets at 29.48. As the tour neared its completion, the Australian press reported that Crawford planned to remain in Australia, that he had attracted the attention of several \\"society\\" women, and that he had become engaged.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1234. Even so, he returned to England when the tour ended.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1242. In May 1909, he published a book about the tour, JN Crawford's Trip to \\"Kangaroo\\" land.Burns, Chapter 6, Location 976. Dispute with SurreyBackground= Lord Alverstone, the president of Surrey County Cricket Club from 1895 to 1915, was a key figure in its dispute with Crawford.alt=A man in legal dress During the 1908 season, Crawford narrowly failed to complete his third double. He scored 1,371 runs at an average of 37.05 and took 98 wickets at 21.48. His season began with a probable dispute over the Surrey captaincy. H. D. G. Leveson Gower had been appointed captain for 1908 but the combination of an injury and his marriage left him unavailable for four matches near the beginning of the season. Crawford also missed the beginning of the season; a newspaper article by Albert Trott, a former Australian Test all-rounder now playing for Middlesex, suggested that Crawford withdrew from the team because he was not appointed captain in Leveson Gower's absence. Instead Harry Bush, who had not played first-class cricket for five years, led the team. Trott was sympathetic to Crawford, stating that the Surrey committee went out of their way \\"to inflict a most undeserved slight\\" on Crawford.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1258. In the remainder of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season.Hart, p. 17. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball.Hart, pp. 17–18. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents. Crawford, who played as an amateur but was not independently wealthy, received an increased expenses allowance during 1908, but other financial dealings with the committee were less successful: they paid his laundry bills in 1905, but refused to do so afterwards; additionally, they refused his request in 1907 to have part of his expenses paid for matches that he missed, as happened with the wages of professionals.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1286. His financial problems were compounded by his inability to find a suitable job, and the Surrey committee threatened that he \\"ought not to be played on the same terms\\" unless he \\"[commenced] to earn his livelihood\\".Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1305. Crawford's performances in the 1909 season were less effective than in previous years. He began well, but was later hampered by an injury which prevented him from bowling.Hart, p. 21. His batting average also fell. Surrey experienced disciplinary problems with several of their professional players during the season. The club president, Lord Alverstone, favoured amateurs, arguing that a losing amateur team was preferable to a professional side that won; several professionals were left out in favour of amateurs.McKinstry, p. 97. Apart from adversely affecting some players' careers, this preference had destabilised the team over several seasons.McKinstry, p. 48. Crawford disagreed with Alverstone, but nevertheless frequently assumed the leadership in the absence of the regular captain Leveson Gower for much of the season. He captained Surrey to a win over the touring Australian team early in 1909 after a strong performance by the professional bowler Tom Rushby. However, his captaincy was strongly criticised in the press, particularly over his management of the bowling.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1328. Around this time, Crawford's form declined. With the bat, he was often dismissed attempting aggressive shots, and he lost his effectiveness as a bowler. As a result, he was not chosen for the Gentlemen and missed selection in the Ashes series. The press continued to criticise his captaincy, despite Surrey's good results under his leadership. Burns notes: \\"For a young man with no experience of prolonged failure on the cricket field, this was almost certainly a traumatic time.\\"Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1366. Surrey had other problems at this time. When the team arrived in Chesterfield to play Derbyshire, eight of the professionals were arrested following an incident in the street; the matter was cleared up and the press suggested that the police had been over-eager. The county subsequently defeated Derbyshire by an innings in early July; Rushby and his fellow professionals Walter Lees and W. C. Smith were very successful with the ball. Shortly after this, Rushby and Lees were involved in an incident of some kind—the exact details are unknown. Leveson Gower suspended them, making them unavailable for Surrey's second match against the Australians. Crawford was asked to lead the team for that game,Green, ed (1982), p. 222. but with Rushby and Lees omitted, another bowler missing and himself unable to bowl owing to a shoulder injury, he considered the attack too weak. Consequently, he refused the captaincy, and apologised to the Australians for the selection of what he thought a substandard side.Green (1988), p. 148. In Crawford's absence, Surrey were led by the professional Tom Hayward; the match, affected by rain, was drawn. =Correspondence and split= The cricket press noticed the absence of Crawford and the professionals from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1478. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, and told him that Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: \\"I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match ... There seems to be some impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a young fellow who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and my request for an alteration of the team should have had some weight\\". In his History of Cricket, Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a \\"literate and quietly self-confident young man who will not easily be manipulated.\\" Alverstone replied that he \\"regretted\\" Crawford's views; the committee respected Crawford as a \\"brilliant amateur with great experience\\", but Crawford had not supported his captain—a prime duty for an amateur. Crawford replied that he had been unaware of the reason for the suspensions of Rushby and Lees—which Alverstone and the committee disputed—and would have supported Leveson Gower, but suggested it was unfair to ask him to captain a weak bowling team and then demand he apologise for preferring not to. He also observed that the players omitted from the team against the Australians had since been restored to the county side, making their exclusion harder to understand in the first place. At this point Leveson Gower withdrew his invitation for Crawford to appear at the Scarborough Festival; Leveson Gower also prevented Crawford's selection for the MCC winter tour of South Africa.Green (1988), p. 149. Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee in support of his son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the \\"deepest ingratitude\\". Wisden reported: \\"The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county.\\" Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: \\"I fail to see why I should practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which I trust will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom.\\" The Surrey committee initially attempted to keep the dispute private, but Crawford sent copies of the letters to the newspapers, explaining in a letter that he wished to end speculation about his absence from the Surrey team.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1489. Burns notes that this \\"[generated] a strong response from the public, mainly unsympathetic to the young amateur\\" in the letters pages of many newspapers.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1491. Many commentators felt that the argument could have been resolved easily had either side made concessions. Green comments that the committee probably either expected Crawford to back down, or were happy to sacrifice him to establish their authority.Green (1988), p. 152. Another of the players involved, Rushby, left Surrey at the end of the season to play league cricket, but later returned to the team.Green, ed (1982), p. 223. Crawford's father made a further attempt to end the dispute between Surrey and his son in 1910, asking the committee to reverse their decision. Wisden reported that Alverstone declined on the grounds that it would suggest a lack of confidence in the committee, but that if Crawford \\"came forward in a sportsmanlike way [Alverstone] would be proud to give his personal support to the step proposed. This of course meant that an apology was expected.\\"Green, ed (1982), p. 224. In his History of Cricket, Green contended that the \\"Surrey committee must be held accountable for a degree of idiocy rarely met with even in the realms of cricket administration\\" for the way they dealt with Crawford, \\"one of the world's most prodigious all-rounders.\\" Hart observes that Crawford was challenging figures high up in the cricket establishment on the Surrey committee; he also suggests that Crawford's actions in his later career, and the complaints made against him by other cricket authorities, reveal a stubbornness in his character and suggest he was not merely a victim of the Surrey committee. The Times speculated that factors other than the dispute may have contributed to Surrey's decision. Burns believes that Crawford was feeling pressure from several directions: his inability to secure a job, possible frustration at the controlling influence of his father, a desire to be independent, his poor run of form and criticism of his captaincy. Even though, according to Burns, it was an \\"unwinnable battle\\", he suggests simply: \\"Young Jack was in the mood for a fight.\\"Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1512. At the end of the season, Crawford played his last matches in England for 10 years, appearing for an \\"England XI\\" against the Australians and for the Gentlemen of the South. He had previously discussed emigrating to Australia with the Australian Test player Victor Trumper, who had asked Clem Hill to investigate a potential teaching post at St Peter's College, Adelaide. Originally, assuming that he would be part of the MCC tour to South Africa, he planned to take up his position in March 1910. When the dispute arose, Crawford sent a telegram to inform the college he would take up the post of \\"Resident Master\\" early in 1910, for a salary of £160 per year.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1525. Burns suggests that this knowledge that he had the offer of work may have prompted him to take a stand against the Surrey committee. In October 1910 he was offered the position of \\"Ordinary Master\\" at the college, and £50 towards his travel expenses if he departed immediately. He left England by boat two days later, seen off by his family.Hart, p. 18. No cricket figures saw his departure, but there was considerable interest from the press.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1535. Later careerCricket in South Australia= The alt=An early 20th-century cricket match, watched by a large crowd At St Peter's School, Crawford combined his teaching role with supervision of sports, including acting as coach for the cricket team.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1560. On several occasions, he had to request leave from the headmaster to play first-class cricket.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1589. After arriving in Australia in December 1909, he was playing district cricket for East Torrens within a week, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the Sheffield Shield competition; the team went on to win the trophy for the first time since 1893–94. Crawford played a large part in this success.Hart, p. 24. There was some controversy over his eligibility to play; New South Wales initially protested, but there was a precedent for ignoring the requirement of a three-month qualification period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee accepted this in the case of Crawford, to the displeasure of the full NSWCA. Over four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 runs at an average of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green suggests that such a performance would have earned him Test selection if he had been Australian, and Wisden noted that his record in Australia was impressive. In the 1910–11 Australian season, Crawford scored a half-century in every first-class game he played but was less successful with the ball. His success against the touring South Africans, perhaps helped by his experience facing their googly bowlers on previous occasions, brought him close to selection for the Australian Test team that year. The Australian Board of Control eventually decided that, as he had already appeared for England, they could not choose him;Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1593. instead they picked Charlie Kelleway as the all-rounder. Crawford resigned from his position as St Peter's in March 1911, suggesting to the press that he might move into farming.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1594. He may have considered leaving South Australia, but the Cricket Association appointed him as a clerk at the Adelaide Oval, a position which earned £200 per annum, with additional responsibility for coaching and youth scouting.Hart, p. 25. Meanwhile, in England, after unsuccessful attempts by his father to change the mind of the Surrey committee, including a failed bid to secure his own election to the committee,Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1584. Crawford sent a written apology to Surrey at some time in 1910. Consequently, the committee passed a motion in March 1911 which ended the ban on Crawford playing for the county.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1601. Press rumours over the following 12 months cast doubt on Crawford's future, suggestions including a return to England for the 1912 season. Instead, he remained with South Australia in the 1911–12 season.Hart, pp. 25–26. Although less successful generally, he played for a non-representative Australian XI against the MCC touring team which contested the Ashes that season and scored 110 in as many minutes against bowlers including Sydney Barnes, at the time regarded as the greatest bowler in the world. The following season, in which South Australia again won the Shield, Crawford took seven for 31 against Western Australia, including a hat-trick, and scored 163 in 177 minutes against Victoria before taking eight for 66 in their first innings.Hart, p. 27. In 1913, Crawford was included in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control to make it an official representative team, but the Board refused to do so.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1644. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class.Hart, p. 28. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England at the conclusion of the tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1678. =Further controversy= In December 1913, Crawford wrote to the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) asking for a six-month leave of absence and a guaranteed renewal of his contract. The SACA described his letter as \\"arrogant\\" before eventually granting his request and offering him a three-year contract worth around £300 per year, including coaching fees. In effect, he wanted to double his salary or leave to seek a position in New Zealand. Describing these events, Hart comments: \\"Crawford's financial dealings with the SACA reveal him both as mercenary and as an awkward 'cuss'. The latter aspect of his personality needs to be taken into account lest he be considered merely an establishment victim in his parting with Surrey\\".Hart, p. 29. On the field, Crawford was successful in 1913–14. He took 34 wickets, and against New South Wales he hit 91 in 89 minutes before taking 10 wickets; against Victoria he took eleven wickets. This latter match was his last for South Australia. Later in 1914, Crawford toured New Zealand with an Australian team—assembled without the approval of the Australian Board of ControlBurns, Chapter 9, Location 1705.—which contained many leading players, under the captaincy of the former Canterbury batsman Arthur Sims.Hart, pp. 30–31. In first-class games on this tour Crawford took 21 wickets and scored a century, but his most notable innings came in a minor match. Against the \\"XV of South Canterbury\\", he scored 354 in five-and-a-quarter hours, striking 14 sixes and 45 fours. He and Victor Trumper shared a partnership of 298 in 69 minutes, and Monty Noble helped him to score 50 runs in 9 minutes as the Australian team scored 922 for nine.Green, ed (1982), p. 381. In March 1914, the Otago Cricket Association (OCA) offered Crawford a three-year contract worth £350 per year, and a share in the management of a sports store, to play for them. Briefly returning to Adelaide after the tour, he resigned from his South Australia contract before moving to Dunedin in June 1914. The South Australian Cricket Association were widely criticised for failing to retain Crawford; in their defence, the committee publicly stated that Crawford had been offered an increased deal and had promised to turn down any offers made to him in New Zealand, but went back on his word.Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1717. Later historians—Nigel Hart in his biography of Crawford, and Chris Harte in his A History of Australian Cricket (1993)—condemned Crawford as arrogant and mercenary for his behaviour towards South Australia. Harte also suggests that Crawford left Australia with many debts. Burns, however, suggests that Crawford may have wanted to maximise his earnings to support his upcoming marriage, and notes that his South Australian teammates held no grudges and even organised a farewell presentation.Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1733. Once in his new position, Crawford immediately organised a Colts team which produced several future Otago players. While qualifying to play for Otago, he played club cricket in Dunedin, scoring 559 runs and taking 88 wickets.Hart, p. 31. During the 1914–15 season he appeared in four first-class games for Otago, in which he scored 337 runs and took 30 wickets. He briefly returned to Australia in 1915 to marry Anita Schmidt in Melbourne in April.Hart, p. 32. Schmidt—from Adelaide and described in the society press as a \\"beauty\\"—and Crawford met in 1912 when the former was 18 years old and became well known as a couple at fashionable events in Adelaide.Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1614. Burns suggests that the wedding took place in Melbourne rather than Adelaide because Crawford may have been avoiding his creditors. Two days after the wedding, the couple returned to New Zealand.Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1742. Crawford's wages caused the OCA some financial difficulty and were the cause of extended negotiations in 1915. Part of the settlement involved Crawford receiving a lower salary in return for freedom to offer his services to other clubs on a freelance basis. As a consequence, he represented different teams throughout the season in local cricket. He was also paid to coach at Otago Boys' High School. There were other difficulties; the association complained about the lateness of Crawford's report on the Otago team, and were unhappy that he also coached golf. Crawford in turn told the association that several Otago players were late for practice. After further complaints about Crawford's coaching in 1916, the OCA decided to terminate his contract. Crawford initially offered to continue for less money—£245. The OCA bargained, suggesting a payment of £200, whereupon Crawford insisted that he should be paid £300. The OCA then proposed to terminate his contract immediately for a payment of £150 but he refused. He was eventually paid £200 in June to leave Otago.Hart, p. 33. That November, with the First World War into its third year, New Zealand brought in conscription. Crawford was called up in July 1917, and was posted to a training camp near Wellington in late 1917. During this time, he played twice for Wellington's cricket team in first-class matches during early 1918. When given weekend passes, he visited his wife who was left alone in Dunedin.Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1797. He travelled to England prior to a posting to the Western Front, although he arrived too late to join the fighting. He was part of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade but it is unclear what his rank was. The Repton School War Register states that he was a rifleman but New Zealand press accounts named him as a quartermaster sergeant. According to a 1992 article in Wisden Cricket Monthly by Jim Sullivan, Crawford was demoted while he was in the army. The reasons are unknown, but Burns speculates that his \\"independent and obstinate nature\\" made it difficult for him to accept military discipline.Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1822. While Crawford was in the army, his wife moved to Adelaide.Hart, p. 34. According to Anita, the marriage became unhappy in 1916 and Crawford left her in November of that year. She claimed that he had not supported her financially from that point. When the war ended, she returned to live in Australia with her parents. Her subsequent career as a dress designer and fashion buyer necessitated a move to London, where Crawford was living, in 1921 but the couple never reconciled. They were divorced, with some publicity in Australia, in 1923; in court, she gave evidence that he had an affair with a \\"third party\\". She went on to remarry and to have a successful career as a designer and orchestral conductor.Burns, Chapter 10, Locations 1935, 1988. =Return to England= After the First World War, Crawford returned to live in England, and was demobilised from the New Zealand Army in April 1919.Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1848. Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if they found him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing that they would be pleased if he played for the county again, could not \\"see [their] way to find him employment\\".Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1839. Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket—unheard of for a former Public School cricketer—but instead found work at Repton, his old school. It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status. In any case, Crawford remained at Repton only until the end of the academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: \\"Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952.\\"Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1853. Having settled his disagreement with Surrey, Crawford resumed his English first-class cricket career in 1919. After appearing for the Gentlemen against the Players, Crawford returned to play for Surrey against the Australian Imperial Forces. He scored 144 not out, which was later described by Wisden as the innings of his life. Surrey were 26 for five in reply to the tourists' innings of 436 when Crawford came in to bat. Neville Cardus reported: \\"[Crawford] fell upon the advancing Australian attack, and by driving seldom equalled, threw it back.\\"Green (1988), p. 153. He more than doubled his score after the ninth wicket had fallen, hitting 73 out of the last 80 runs scored in 35 minutes to take Surrey past the target required to avoid the follow-on. Among his other successes, he scored 92 against Yorkshire. Playing against Kent, he hit 48 not out as Jack Hobbs and he scored 96 in 32 minutes; this partnership took Surrey to victory as they chased an apparently impossible chase in the short time remaining in the match.Green, ed (1982), p. 751. In total, Crawford played in eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. Wisden commented that his batting was as good as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in first-class cricket. Part of the explanation was that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920,Hart, p. 36. but by 1921 he had left the club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that he had returned to Surrey.Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1932. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club.Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1940. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66. From the mid-1920s until his retirement in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers Elders and Fyffes. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life.Hart, p. 3. He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children.Burns, Chapter 10, Location 2003. He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for Pelham Warner, at a centenary celebration for the Free Foresters Cricket Club and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday. Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill for the rest of the year;Burns, Epilogue, Location 2054. he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2 May 1963. Style and technique Crawford demonstrating his bowling action in 1906 Crawford's obituary in The Times described him as one of the best young players to play cricket in England and said: \\"Although he invariably played in glasses, he was a most attractive player to watch, an aggressive hitter of the ball and a dangerous medium-paced bowler\\". Wisden described him as a \\"hard-hitting batsman\\", and said he played mainly from the front foot. He had an orthodox batting technique, moved his feet well to get to the ball, and played very straight. Herbie Collins, who played with Crawford in Australia, described one of his innings as \\"a hurricane innings, full of classical shots charged with dynamite.\\" As a bowler, Crawford's technique was also orthodox, although he was unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second.Burns, Chapter 5, Location 863. His bowling pace varied from fast to medium, and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it.Burns, Chapter 5, Location 873. An accurate bowler, it was difficult for batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat, but his most effective delivery was his off break: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. John Arlott described him as \\"the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight\\". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that \\"people who have seen both men consider [Crawford] a better all-rounder\\". Commenting on the interruption of Crawford's career by his dispute with Surrey, Neville Cardus wrote: \\"His break with Surrey must be regarded as a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself, and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket. It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket ... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains.\\" The Times commented: \\"It was one of the great disappointments of English cricket in the first quarter of this century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized.\\" Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's \\"capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. He could turn games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'\\".Hart, pp. 36–37. He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life \\"in comparative sporting obscurity\\". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1470.

(CPI) was an American manufacturer of computer printers, based in Rochester, Michigan. CPI's precursor, Holley Computer Products, was formed as a joint venture between Control Data Corporation (CDC) and the Holley Carburetor Company in April 1962. Holley developed and produced a series of drum printers. In June 1964, CDC bought out Holley and partnered with NCR and ICL to form CPI in Rochester. In the early 1970s CPI also had a branch in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. This division made punched card readers and 9-track magnetic tape drives for both parent companies (CDC and NCR). In 1978 CDC bought controlling interest of CPI. CPI produced several train printers under the CDC and Fastrain brands, including the CDC Model 512 (1967), the Fastrain A 1200 LPM (1969) and the Fastrain 9372-III 2000 LPM (1976). In 1977, CPI began manufacturing printers at a factory in Stevenage, Herts, UK that was originally used for the manufacture of ICL1900 computers. By 1979, the factory also made 9-track tape drives which were used in ICL and CDC computers, and were sold with industry-standard interfaces for use with other manufacturer's computers.

It is said to date back to the period of Mauryan emperor, Ashoka (304–232 BCE). Circular in shape, the well is lined with brick in the upper and contains wooden rings in the remaining . The Agam Kuan is set within an archaeological site identified by the Archaeological Survey of India which also contains the adjacent Shitala Devi temple where the folk deity Shitala Devi is venerated. Inside this temple, the pindas of the Saptamatrikas (the seven mother goddesses) are worshipped. The temple is widely revered for its belief in curing smallpox and chicken pox. Location Agam Kuan is situated close to the Gulzarbagh railway station, on the way to Panch Pahadi, on the outskirts of Patna, Bihar state. It is east of Patna and south-west of Gulzarbagh Station. India According to the legend During the 1890s, the British explorer, Laurence Waddell, while exploring the ruins of Pataliputra, identified Agam Kuan as the legendary well built by Ashoka for the purpose of torture before he embraced Buddhism, as part of Ashoka's Hell chambers. The torture practice was also reported by Chinese travellers (most probably Fa Hien) of the 5th and 7th centuries A.D. The well is stated to have been used to torture convicts by throwing them into the fire that used to emanate from the well. Ashoka's Edict no. VIII makes mention of this well, which was also known as \\"fiery well\\" or \\"hell on earth\\". Another popular legend states that this was the well where Ashoka threw 99 of his elder half-brother's heads and put the heads in the well to obtain the throne of the Mauryan Empire. According to a myth, the well has a subterranean link with the Patala (netherworld) or hell; this was inferred on the basis that a saint found a heavy log in the well which was supposed to have been lost in the sea. Another geo-hydrological link suggested that Agam Kuan is connected to the Ganges river. The site is also connected with several Jain legends, the most notable of them being that of a Jain monk, Sudarshana, who, when thrown into the well by a king named Chand, floated to the surface and was found seated on a lotus. Statue of Matrikas found near Agam Kuan. Visitors throw coins into Agam Kuan, as it is still considered auspicious. It is used for many religious ceremonies, especially Hindu weddings. Although it is venerated, the well waters are not consumed. Offerings of flowers and coins are thrown into the well usually during summer months as the well's history is linked to \\"heat and hell\\". Dating to Mohammedan rule, the Mughal officials offered coins of gold and silver to Agam Kuan. Features The structure is deep, circular in plan, with a diameter extending over . It is brick-encased in the upper half to a depth of while the lower are secured by a series of wooden rings. Covered with moss, the surface structure, which now covers the well and forms its most distinctive feature, has eight arched windows. The well was refurbished during the reign of Emperor Akbar and a roofed structure was built around the well. This circular structure has been fitted with eight windows which are well placed. Grounds The Shitala Devi temple In addition to the Agam Kuan, the archaeological site features a temple, as well as several ancient and medieval sculptures. The Shitala Devi temple is adjacent to the well, and is dedicated to Shitala Devi, which houses the pindas of the Saptamatrikas (the seven mother goddesses). The temple is widely venerated for its belief in curing smallpox and chicken pox, and it is also visited by devotees for wish fulfillment. The temple's female priest is an uncommon practice. A statue of Yaksha of the Mauryan art period stands guard outside the temple. It was described earlier by Alexander Cunningham when he visited the site in 1879–80.British Library \\"A. Cunningham (Alexander Cunningham) wrote (after his 1879-80 tour), 'When I saw the two statues in the New Indian Museum at Calcutta, I then remembered that a broken statue of a similar kind was still standing at Agam Kua, just outside the city of Patna, adorned with a new head and a pair of roughly marked breasts, so as to do duty for the great goddess Mata-Mai...The Agam Kua is a very large and very old brick well...The broken figure is said to have been found in this well, and it seems probable therefore that the two statues were also found either at or near the same place.\\" This artifact is not traceable in the present day.

Although only selected to play for England on one occasion, he was lauded for his skills in first-class cricket and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1991. He became Essex coach in 1993, and coached Surrey between 2005 and 2008. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman noted Butcher was, \\"a popular and accomplished left- handed opener, unlucky to be consigned to membership of the 'One Cap Club'... despite consistent county performances and an ability to tackle quick bowlers, Butcher was passed over\\". Personal lifeEarly years= Born in Croydon, Surrey, Butcher played his earliest organised cricket with Beckenham under-11's. His parents moved to Australia where he spent five and a half of his formative years during which time he played for Glenelg youth team. His performances there won him their Junior Cricketer award for outstanding play and a selection to the South Australia under-15 team. Had his parents stayed in Australia, he would likely have joined the senior side and later been eligible to play for Australia as his adopted country. However, his parents chose to move back to England. =Cricket in the family= Cricket is a strong tradition in Alan Butcher's family. His two brothers, Martin and Ian, both played first-class cricket and both of his sons have also gone on to do so. His eldest son, Mark found fame playing for, and also captaining, Surrey and was for some time a mainstay batsman for England, not suffering the one-Test fate of his father. The youngest, Gary, has also played for Surrey and Glamorgan. In 1991, Mark and Alan Butcher played against each other in a Sunday League match at The Oval, on the occasion of Mark's Surrey debut. Mark Butcher announced his retirement from cricket in 2009. His daughter Bryony Butcher, one of twins, plays for Essex under 15's, Kelvedon and her school, Honywood Community Science School. Her sister, Ceri Butcher, used to play cricket, but is more interested in gymnastics. The twins have won many sporting awards, such as Bryony winning \\"athlete of the year\\". Cricketing careerEarly years= Butcher was a left-handed opening batsman with an aggressive playing style and a fondness for hitting shots off the back foot, although he started his career as a left-arm fast-medium bowler. He began playing for Surrey in 1972 as a bowler, but started opening the batting in 1975. He stayed with Surrey for 15 years. When Grahame Clinton joined Surrey in 1979, the two formed a successful and longstanding opening partnership. They shared in nineteen century opening stands for Surrey, including one of 277 against Yorkshire in 1984.Surrey County Cricket Club First-Class Records 1846–2000, Limited Overs Records 1963–2000, compiled by The Surrey Statistics Group, published by Surrey County Cricket Club. =International selection and sole Test cap= In 1979, he was picked to play for England against India in a Test match at The Oval, but he did not settle, and only managed scores of 14 and 20. He was not selected for England again, in spite of the opinion of the then England captain Mike Brearley, who rated him one of the top players of fast bowling in the county game. During his time with Surrey, he averaged between 1,300 and 1,700 runs each season. =Later years and retirement from playing= In 1986, Surrey declined to renew his contract and he seriously considered retiring as a cricketer. However, Glamorgan approached him with an offer of a team place which he accepted. He eventually rose to captain Glamorgan in 1989, before retiring in 1992. He made 22,667 runs in first-class matches in 684 innings, with 46 hundreds and a high score of 216 not out. His most productive season was 1990, when he scored 2,116 runs at 58.77. He also took 141 wickets in his career at 38.53, with a best innings analysis of 6 for 48. Coaching careerEnglish counties= Butcher followed his playing career with coaching roles at Essex and Surrey. However, he made a surprise comeback as a player for Surrey in 1998, at the age of 44, when injury left them short of players. His recall coincided with the day his son Mark Butcher made his maiden Test century for England against South Africa. In his first County Championship match since 1992, Butcher senior scored 22 and 12.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1999 Having been Surrey's Assistant Coach, he was appointed the Chief Coach for the 2006 season. He left his post following Surrey's relegation from the 1st Division of the County Championship in 2008. =International= From 4 March 2010 until early 2013 Butcher was the head coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. Butcher was highly credited for reviving Zimbabwean cricket as the national and domestic game greatly improved. When Butcher took over, the team's confidence was at an all-time low. Butcher gave that side more confidence and responsibility. In return, the Zimbabwean team defeated Australia and Pakistan in the warm-ups of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, but struggled in the main event. They also defeated Sri Lanka and India (twice) in the Tri-Series tournament. Following this, expectations were high that Zimbabwe would spring an upset or two at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, but the team could not match those expectations. This was followed by victory in Zimbabwe's first Test match in six years, against Bangladesh, which was a historic achievement, further backed up by another ODI Series win. The team then had a nine-match losing streak before they broke it with a record win against top opponent New Zealand, chasing 328 to win. They then nearly defeated the same opponents in the one-off Test, chasing 366 at Bulawayo, but a spectacular collapse, in which they lost six wickets for 44 runs made them end up with a 34-run loss. With their recent improved performances Butcher, who had a major role to play, said that his team could beat New Zealand on the Test match in the return leg in January 2012. He wrote a book about his time with Zimbabwe entitled The Good Murungu? A Cricket Tale of the Unexpected, which was published in 2016.Daily Telegraph sports section, \\"Butcher's tale reveals tragedy and comedy of Zimbabwe\\" by Steve James, p20, 10 May 2016.

Inscription on his birthplace in Kirchheim in Schwaben. Gregorius Thomas Ziegler, bishop of Linz (March 7, 1770 - April 15, 1852), was born at Kirchheim in Schwaben near Augsburg. He joined the Benedictines at Wiblingen Abbey in 1788 and was ordained priest on 25 May 1793. He taught in various Benedictine institutions until he became prior of Wiblingen. After the dissolution of Wiblingen abbey in 1806 he removed with some of his confreres to Tyniec in Poland and taught theology at the neighbouring University of Cracow. When the Benedictines were forced to leave Tyniec in 1809 he was engaged as professor of church history at the Lyceum of Linz, 1809–15, and of theology at Vienna, 1815-22. On 2 February 1822, he became Bishop of the new diocese of Tyniec, but transferred his see to Tarnów, where he began the erection of a seminary and renovated the cathedral. On April 13, 1827, he was promoted to the diocese of Linz, where he remained until his death. Although the Church throughout Austria at this date was still dependent to a very great degree on the government in ecclesiastical matters, the bishop knew how to revive and strengthen the ecclesiastical spirit in his clergy and people. Of great importance was the introduction of the Jesuits and their settlement on the Freinberg near Linz, which was accomplished by means of the vigorous and generous aid of Archduke Maximilian of Este, and the foundation of numerous other religious establishments (Franciscans, Salesians, Sisters of Mercy, etc.). The Revolution of 1848 not only increased political liberty, but also gave to the Church greater independence in its own province. The bishop at once made use of the regained freedom to revive popular missions, which had been discontinued since the reign of Maria Theresa. In 1850 at his instance a ten day's mission was held by the Redemptorists, at which the number of communicants was reckoned at 50,000. In the same year, the diocesan theological institute was placed entirely under episcopal supervision, and an examination of candidates for the position of parish priests was established; in October for the first time examinations were held by prosynodal examiners. He laboured successfully for the emancipation of the Church from governmental encroachments, fostered the religious life of the clergy and laity by introducing clerical retreats and popular missions, and advanced the religious education of the laity by introducing religious orders. He is the author of Die Feier der heil. Firmung in der Kath. Kirche (Vienna, 1817); Das Kath. Glaubensprincip (Vienna, 1823); Züge und Schilderungern aus dem Leben des sel. Seb. Franz Job (Linz, 1835) and various minor works, pastoral letters, occasional lectures, and sermons. He also re-edited Klypfel's Institutiones theologiae dogmaticae (Vienna, 1819–21) and contributed various theological treatises to Jakob Frint's Theologische Zeitschrift (Vienna, 1813–16).

Ne Win and the Burmese military launched the March 1962 coup d'état to overthrow Prime Minister U Nu and the democratic Union Parliament due to economic, religious and political crises, particularly the issue of federalism and secession rights of the States of Burma. The Union Revolutionary Council established Burma as a one- party socialist state under the BSPP and adopted the Burmese Way to Socialism in April 1962 as a blueprint for economic development, decreasing foreign influence in Burma to zero percent and increasing the role of the military. Ne Win ruled Burma as a de facto dictator as Chairman of the BSPP and other top offices including Prime Minister and President. Burma was renamed the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma and the Union Revolutionary Council was replaced with the People's Assembly in 1974. The Burmese Way to Socialism was characterized by isolationism, totalitarianism, superstition, xenophobia, sinophobia, and the rejection of Cold War politics. The Burmese Way to Socialism often described as Illiberal democracy and have been largely described by scholars as an \\"abject failure\\", and as turning one of the most prosperous countries (aka. Asia's Tiger) in Asia into one of the world's poorest. Burma experienced greatly increased poverty, inequality, corruption and international isolation, and has been described as \\"disastrous\\". Burma's real per capita GDP (constant 2000 US$) increased from $159.18 in 1962 to $219.20 in 1987, or about 1.3% per year - one of the weakest growth rates in East Asia over this period, but still positive. The program also may have served to increase domestic stability and keep Burma from being as entangled in the Cold War struggles that affected other Southeast Asian nations. The Burmese Way to Socialism was overthrown in the pro-democracy 8888 Uprising in 1988 after Ne Win's attempt to make the Kyat based in denominations divisible by 9 wiped out the savings of millions of Burmese people. The 8888 Uprising was violently suppressed by the military, which later established the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Background Burma under Prime Minister U Nu and the AFPFL-led coalition government in the Union Parliament had implemented left-wing economic and welfare policies, although economic growth remained slow throughout the 1950s. By 1958, Burma was largely beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the ruling AFPFL into two factions: the Clean AFPFL (သန့္ရှင်းဖဆပလ) led by U Nu and Thakin Tin, and the Stable AFPFL (တည်မြဲဖဆပလ) led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. This situation persisted despite the unexpected success of U Nu's \\"Arms for Democracy\\" offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the Pa-O, some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms. The Union Parliament became very unstable, with U Nu barely surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have crypto-communists amongst them. Hardliners in the Burmese Army viewed this as a threat of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and resulted in U Nu inviting General Ne Win, the Army Chief of Staff, to serve as interim prime minister to restore order in Burma. Over 400 \\"communist sympathizers\\" were arrested, of which 153 were deported to a penal colony on Great Coco Island in the Andaman Sea. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. Newspapers like Botahtaung, Kyemon and Rangoon Daily were also closed down. On 28 October 1958, minor Skyfall of Once a great nation acted by Ne Win staging a coup d'état under the auspices of U Nu and successfully restored Burma's political stability, a period known as the \\"Ne Win caretaker government\\", until the February 1960 general election which returned U Nu's Clean AFPFL, renamed as the Union Party, with a large majority. Ne Win officially handed back power to the victorious U Nu on 4 April 1960. However, the situation in Burma did not remain stable for long due to petitions from the Shan federalist movement started by Sao Shwe Thaik, the first President of Burma from 1948 to 1952 and the Saopha of Nyaung Shwe. The Shan federalists were aspiring to create a \\"loose\\" federation in Burma, and were seen as a separatist movement for insisting on the Burmese government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the 1947 Constitution. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan Saopha of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959, but the unresolved issues of federalism and social order continued. =1962 Burmese coup d'état= By 1962, the Burmese public perceived the elected civilian government as corrupt, inept at ruling the country, and unable to restore law and order, while the Burmese military were popular from stability created by Ne Win's caretaker government. On 2 March 1962, less than two years after returning to civilian rule, Ne Win launched a second military-backed coup d'état ( The rea, this time without U Nu's blessing. Ne Win established Burma as a one-party socialist state under a military government with the Union Revolutionary Council replacing the Union Parliament as the supreme governing body. Ne Win became a dictator as both the Chairman of the Union Revolutionary Council and the Prime Minister, the head of state and the head of government in Burma, respectively. In April, the Union Revolutionary Council government adopted \\"Burmese Way to Socialism\\" as its official political and economic ideology for governing Burma. In July, the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) was founded as part of the Burmese Way to Socialism to be Burma's sole legal political party. The BSPP became the official ruling party with Ne Win as its Chairman. Ideological features The \\"Burmese Way to Socialism\\" has been described by some commentators as anti-Western, isolationist and socialist in nature, characterised also by an extensive dependence on the military, emphasis on the rural populace, and Burmese (or more specifically, Burman) nationalism. In January 1963, the \\"Burmese Way to Socialism\\" was further elaborated in a political public policy called the System of Correlation of Man and His Environment (), was published, as the philosophical and political basis for the Burmese approach to society and what Ne Win deemed as socialism, influenced by Buddhist, humanist and Marxist views. The fundamentals of the \\"Burmese Way to Socialism\\", as outlined in 1963, were as follows: # In setting forth their programmes as well as in their execution the Revolutionary Council will study and appraise the concrete realities and also the natural conditions peculiar to Burma objectively. On the basis of the actual findings derived from such study and appraisal it will develop its own ways and means to progress. # In its activities the Revolutionary Council will strive for self- improvement by way of self-criticism. Having learnt from contemporary history the evils of deviation towards right or left the Council will with vigilance avoid any such deviation. # In whatever situations and difficulties the Revolutionary Council may find itself it will strive for advancement in accordance with the times, conditions, environment and the ever-changing circumstances, keeping at heart the basic interests of the nation. # The Revolutionary Council will diligently seek all ways and means whereby it can formulate and carry out such programmes as are of real and practical value for the well-being of the nation. In doing so it will critically observe, study and avail itself of the opportunities provided by progressive ideas, theories and experiences at home, or abroad without discrimination between one country of origin and another. The policy sought to reorganize the Burmese economy to a socialist economy, to develop the Burmese military, and to construct a national identity among many disparate ethnic minorities and the majority Burmans. Impact The effects of the \\"Burmese Way to Socialism\\" were multi- fold, affecting the economy, educational standards, and living standards of the Burmese people. Foreign aid organisations, like the American-based Ford Foundation and Asia Foundation, as well as the World Bank, were no longer allowed to operate in the country. Only permitted was aid from a government- to-government basis. In addition, the teaching of the English language was reformed and moved to secondary schools, whereas previously it had started as early as kindergarten. The government also implemented extensive visa restrictions for Burmese citizens, especially when their destinations were Western countries. Instead, the government sponsored the travel of students, scientists and technicians to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, in order to receive training and to \\"counter years of Western influence\\" in the country. Similarly, visas for foreigners were limited to just 24 hours. Furthermore, freedom of expression and the freedom of the press was extensively restricted. Foreign language publications were prohibited, as were newspapers that printed \\"false propagandist news.\\" The Press Scrutiny Board (now the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division), which censors all publications to this day, including newspapers, journals, advertisements and cartoons, was established by the RC through the Printers' and Publishers' Registration Act in August 1962. The RC set up the News Agency of Burma (BNA) to serve as a news distribution service in the country, thus effectively replacing the work of foreign news agencies. In September 1963, The Vanguard and The Guardian, two Burmese newspapers, were nationalized. In December 1965, publication of privately owned newspapers was banned by the government. The impact on the Burmese economy was extensive. The Enterprise Nationalization Law, passed by the Revolutionary Council in 1963, nationalized all major industries, including import-export trade, rice, banking, mining, teak and rubber on 1 June 1963. In total, around 15,000 private firms were nationalized. Furthermore, industrialists were prohibited from establishing new factories with private capital. This was particularly detrimental to the Anglo-Burmese, Burmese Indians and the British, who were disproportionately represented in these industries. The oil industry, which was previously controlled by American and British companies, such as the General Exploration Company and East Asiatic Burma Oil, were forced to end operations. In its place was the government-owned Burma Oil Company, which monopolized oil extraction and production. In August 1963, the nationalization of basic industries, including department stores, warehouses and wholesale shops, followed. Price control boards were also introduced. The Enterprise Nationalization Law directly affected foreigners in Burma, particularly Burmese Indians and the Burmese Chinese, both of whom had been influential in the economic sector as entrepreneurs and industrialists. By mid-1963, 2,500 foreigners a week were leaving Burma. By September 1964, approximately 100,000 Indian nationals had left the country. The black market became a major feature of Burmese society, representing about 80% of the national economy during the Burmese Way period. Moreover, income disparity became a major socioeconomic issue. Throughout the 1960s, Burma's foreign exchange reserves declined from $214 million in 1964 to $50 million in 1971, while inflation skyrocketed. Rice exports also declined, from 1,840,000 tons in 1961-62 to 350,000 tons in 1967-68, the result of the inability of rice production to satisfy demand caused by high population growth rates. In the First Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) Congress in 1971, several minor economic reforms were made, in light of the failures of the economic policy pursued throughout the 1960s. The Burmese government asked to rejoin the World Bank, joined the Asian Development Bank, and sought more foreign aid and assistance. The Twenty-Year Plan, an economic plan divided into five increments of implementation, was introduced, in order to develop the country's natural resources, including agriculture, forestry, oil and natural gas, through state development. These reforms brought living standards back to pre-World War II levels and stimulated economic growth. However, by 1988, foreign debt had ballooned to $4.9 billion, about three-fourths of the national GDP, and Ne Win's later attempt to make the Kyat based in denominations divisible by 9, a number he considered to be auspicious, led to the wiping of millions of savings of the Burmese people, resulting in the 8888 Uprising.

The Al-Manakh market was housed in an air-conditioned parking garage, and specialized in highly speculative and unregulated non-Kuwaiti companies. At its peak, its market capitalization was the third highest in the world, behind only the U.S. and Japan, and ahead of the U.K. and France. Background The large oil revenues of the 1970s left many private individuals with substantial funds at their disposal. These funds prompted a speculation boom in the official stock market in the mid-1970s that culminated in a small crash in 1977. The government's response to this crash was to bail out the affected investors and to introduce stricter regulations. This response unintentionally contributed to the far larger stock market crash of the 1980s by driving the least risk-averse speculators into the technically illegal alternate market, the Souk Al-Manakh. The Souk Al-Manakh had emerged parallel to the official stock market, which was dominated by several older wealthy families who traded, largely among themselves, in very large blocks of stock. The Souk Al-Manakh soon became the market for the new investor and, in the end, for many old investors as well. Crash Share dealings using postdated checks created a huge unregulated expansion of credit. The crash of the unofficial stock market finally came in August 1982, when a dealer presented a postdated check from a young Passport Office employee for payment and it bounced. By September 1982, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance ordered all dubious checks to be turned in for clearance, and shut down the Souk Al-Manakh. The official investigation summed the value of worthless outstanding checks at the equivalent of US$94 billion from about 6,000 investors. Kuwait's financial sector was badly shaken by the crash, as was the entire economy. The crash prompted a recession that rippled through society as individual families were disrupted by the investment risks of particular members made on family credit. The debts from the crash left all but one bank in Kuwait technically insolvent, held up only by support from the Central Bank. Only the National Bank of Kuwait, the largest commercial bank, survived the crisis intact. In the end, the government stepped in, devising a complicated set of policies, embodied in the Difficult Credit Facilities Resettlement Program. The implementation of the program was still incomplete in 1990 when the Iraqi invasion changed the entire financial picture. Effects Coupled with reduced oil revenues caused by the ongoing Iran–Iraq War, the Souk Al-Manakh crash helped to push the entire Gulf region into a recession.

Weinstein (born April 25, 1941) is an American chess master from Brooklyn, New York, who was awarded the FIDE International Master title in 1962. He has been detained in a psychiatric hospital since killing a man in 1964. Chess career Weinstein attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he was two grades ahead of Bobby Fischer. He won the 1958 U.S. Junior Chess Championship in Homestead, Florida. Weinstein played first board on the Brooklyn College chess team which became national collegiate champions. He played a total of five times in the U.S. Chess Championship. Weinstein played for the American team, led by William Lombardy, that won the 1960 World Student Team Championship in Leningrad, USSR, the first time the U.S. team had ever won that title. Weinstein tied for the gold medal on his board in that event. Weinstein played on the U.S. team in the 1960 world Chess Olympiad in Leipzig, East Germany. Weinstein defeated many top American players, including Samuel Reshevsky and Pal Benko. He never defeated Fischer, although he drew one game of four with him (in the 1959–60 US Championship). Weinstein's best tournament result came in the 1960–61 U.S. Championship, where he finished third, after Fischer and Lombardy. As this was a zonal year, this result qualified Weinstein to play in the Interzonal tournament, held in Stockholm in 1962, though neither he nor Lombardy played, with their places being taken by Benko and Arthur Bisguier. This result also gave Weinstein the automatic International Master title. Weinstein defeated Lombardy, Reshevsky, Bisguier and Robert Byrne in this tournament. Illness In 1963, he graduated from Brooklyn College with a degree in psychology and travelled to Amsterdam, Netherlands, to attend graduate school. By this time, however, he had apparently developed a severe mental illness. He was reportedly arrested for assault; Dutch chess author Tim Krabbe has identified the victim as the Dutch psychology professor and International Master Johan Barendregt. Soon after this incident, he was deported to the United States. There, he was detained in a half-way house, where he killed his 83-year-old roommate with a razor after an argument.Raymond Weinstein Chess Notes 5069 Weinstein was deemed incapable to stand trial, and remanded to a psychiatric hospital. He is currently detained at the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center on Manhattan's Wards Island.

Letters containing open counters include c, f, h, s etc. The digits 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 also possess a counter. An aperture is the opening between an open counter and the outside of the letter. The lowercase 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-story '8px' has one closed counter and one open counter (and hence one aperture); the double-story '8px' has two closed counters. The digit 4 also has two typographic variants: the closed-top variant '8px' has a closed counter, and an open-top (e.g. handwritten) '10px' has an open counter. Open and closed apertures Different typeface styles have different tendencies to use open or more closed apertures. This design decision is particularly important for sans-serif typefaces, which can have very wide strokes making the apertures very narrow indeed. Corbel, Helvetica and Haettenschweiler.Three sans-serif fonts: Corbel with open apertures, Helvetica with closed apertures and Haettenschweiler which is also condensed. Notice how 8 and 9 in Haettenschweiler are barely distinguishable. Fonts designed for legibility often have very open apertures, keeping the strokes widely separated from one another to reduce ambiguity. This may be especially important in situations such as signs to be viewed at a distance, materials intended to be viewed by people with vision problems, or small print, especially on poor-quality paper. Fonts with open apertures include Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Corbel and Droid Sans, all designed for use on low-resolution displays, and Frutiger, FF Meta and others designed for print use. This design trend has become increasingly common with the spread of humanist sans-serif designs since the 1980s and the 1990s and the use of computers requiring new fonts which are legible on-screen. Grotesque or neo-grotesque sans-serif fonts like Helvetica use very closed apertures, folding up stroke ends to make them closer together. This gives these designs a distinctive, compact appearance, but may make similar letterforms hard to distinguish. Closed letterforms on highly condensed grotesque designs such as Impact and Haettenschweiler make characters such as 8 and 9 almost indistinguishable at small print sizes. Designer Nick Shinn has suggested that the cause of this design trend, similar to the Didone serif typefaces of the nineteenth century, may have been the desire to distribute the pressure of the printing press on the type, reducing wear.My Type Design Philosophy by Martin Majoor  See also  * Figure space * Thin space * Paren space * Counterpunch (typography) References Category:Typography Category:Whitespace ","title":"Counter (typography)"},{"id":"2490025","text":"Strela or strila (, - arrow) is a popular type of candy sold in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), primarily in Ukraine. It gets its name from its distinctive foiled cone shape which resembles an arrowhead. Form Strela has a very distinctive shape, taste and structure. The base is a metal cone made from a round piece of foil, sprinkled with a thin layer of chocolate. The candy is filled with a brandy-flavoured cream filling (although some manufacturers use fruit flavourings), which is extremely soft at room temperature. The wide end is sealed with a thick piece of chocolate and the confection is decorated according to the manufacturer's taste. The foil cone is the distinguishing feature of this type of candy. It allows for ease of manufacture and safe storage and transportation of an otherwise too-soft candy body. Before eating, the candy is chilled so that the thin chocolate layer does not melt and become sticky; 20 °C is sufficient, but some people prefer a temperature of around 0 so that the candy will slowly melt in the mouth. The candy is held by the thick cone cap (which is deliberately left outside the foil cone and thick enough to hold) and the foil is gently unrolled immediately before consumption. Because of their delicious taste, exquisite look and quality, this type of candy has a steady consumer base in the CIS, but the relatively high price (~30 US cents per piece) and small amount of chocolate restricts it from more widespread popularity. Manufacturers Since the trademark belonged to the former USSR and the candy was produced in more than one factory, the name is permitted for use by any manufacturer as long as the product satisfies certain technical requirements.

As the name implied, the rally consisted of a drive from London, UK to Peking, China. Peking is now officially known as Beijing, but the old name was used, as the rally traced the course driven by the Italians Prince Scipione Borghese, mechanic Ettore Guizzardi and journalist Luigi Barzini in the Peking to Paris race in 1907 (before the name change). The 1990 rally ran in the opposite direction as the 1907 course, heading west-to-east. Origins In March 1907, the Parisian newspaper Le Matin issued a challenge for anyone to drive from Peking to Paris by motor-car. Five teams; four French, and one Italian took up the challenge. Thus began the first, and most famous international car rally in early motoring history. Barzini had written a popular book about his adventure, being the first to arrive in Paris, but a decade later, the Soviet Union closed off the route used by Barzini. With the glasnost and perestroika of the final days of the Soviet Union, the time seemed right for a new journey. 1990 The 1990 course went from west-to-east along a different course than Barzini and his team took in 1907. Starting at Marble Arch in London, the drivers were given a sendoff by Luigi Barzini's grandson. The drivers headed across the Channel on the P&O; Ferry to France. From there, the drivers could take any course they chose across Europe before reuniting in Istanbul, Turkey. Afterward, the route ran across Turkey to the border with the Soviet Union in present-day Georgia, becoming the first time in Soviet history that western civilians were permitted to drive their own vehicles into the country. A ferry across the Caspian Sea took the drivers to present day Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, before entering China, crossing the Gobi Desert and arriving in Beijing on June 4, 1990, coincidentally the first anniversary of the crackdown on demonstrators in Tian'anmen Square. The 1907 event was not intended to be a race or competition, but quickly became one due to the pioneering nature of it and the technical superiority of the Italians' car, a 40-HP Itala. The 1990 event was a goodwill tour, and no drivers were in competition. Among the entrants in 1990, were vintage and antique vehicles, several motorcycles with and without sidecars, and modern four wheel drive vehicles, and amazingly all but one of the over 20 teams completed the journey. A 60-minute highlights broadcast was hosted and narrated by actor Cliff Robertson and shown on ESPN in the United States. Legacy *In 1908 another transcontinental race was held, running from Times Square in New York City west to Paris. *With the opening of the borders in both the former Soviet Union and China, transcontinental rallies are feasible once again, though rarely attempted due to the costs and time involved. One such event has been run, a 1997 motor rally that roughly duplicated the 1908 course.

Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia, which are regions that help regulate movement. GA1 causes secondary carnitine deficiency, as glutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Mental retardation may also occur.  Signs and symptoms  The severity of glutaric acidemia type 1 varies widely; some individuals are only mildly affected, while others suffer severe problems. GA1 can be defined as two clinical entities: GA-1 diagnosed at birth or pre-birth and managed through dietary restrictions, and GA-1 diagnosed after an encephalopathic crisis. A crisis may occur under both headings, but individuals diagnosed prior to a crisis can be managed to avoid most or all injury. =GA1 without encephalopathic crisis= Macrocephaly  Babies with glutaric acidemia type 1 often are born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. It is thus important to investigate all cases of macrocephaly of unknown origins for GCDH deficiency, given the importance of the early diagnosis of GA1. Macrocephaly is a \\"pivotal clinical sign\\" of many neurological diseases. Physicians and parents should be aware of the benefits of investigating for an underlying neurological disorder, particularly a neurometabolic one, in children with head circumferences in the highest percentiles. =GA1 after an encephalopathic crisis=Neuromotor aspects Affected individuals may have difficulty moving and may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity or decreased muscle tone and muscle weakness (which may be the result of secondary carnitine deficiency). Glutaric aciduria type 1, in cases of suffered crisis, can be defined as a cerebral palsy of genetic origins. =Occupational therapy= A common way to manage striatal necrosis is to provide special seating. These special wheelchairs are designed to limit abnormal movements. However, spasticity can be worsened by constraint. Parents and caregivers can provide a more interactive occupational therapy by enabling the child to use his or her own excessive postural muscle tone to his or her own advantage (see picture; note the care with which minimal pressure is applied while ensuring safety). The excessive tone can also be managed with \\"jolly jumpers\\" and other aids to the upright stance that do not constrain the child but help him or her gradually tone down the rigidity. Lateral sulcus becomes non operculated. Bleeding abnormalities Some individuals with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that could be mistaken for the effects of child abuse.  Genetics  The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern: mutated copies of the gene GCDH must be provided by both parents to cause glutaric acidemia type 1. The GCDH gene encodes the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in degrading the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Mutations in the GCDH' gene prevent production of the enzyme or result in the production of a defective enzyme with very low residual activity, or an enzyme with relatively high residual activity but still phenotypic consequences. This enzyme deficiency allows glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and (to a lesser extent) glutaconic acid to build up to abnormal levels, especially at times when the body is under stress. These intermediate breakdown products are particularly prone to affect the basal ganglia, causing many of the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type 1. Glutaric acidemia type 1 occurs in approximately 1 of every 30,000 to 40,000 births. It is much more common in the Amish community and in the Ojibway population of Canada, where up to 1 in 300 newborns may be affected. Relatives of children with GA1 can have very low GCDH activity: in an early study of GA1, GCDH activity was found to be 38%, 42%, and 42% of controls in three of the four relatives tested. Those levels are close to those found by Christensen & al in some heavily symptomatic GA1-affected children. Diagnosis Normally in MRI the Sylvian fissure is operculated, but in glutaric acidemia type 1, it is not operculated. In many areas, GA1 is included in newborn screening panels. Elevated glutarylcarnitine can be detected by mass spectrometry in a dried blood spot collected shortly after birth. After a positive screening result, confirmatory testing is performed. This includes urine organic acid analysis, looking for glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. Plasma and urine acylcarnitine analysis can also be informative. Molecular analysis, including gene sequencing and copy number analysis of GCDH can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular testing can also provide information for family planning and prenatal testing, if desired.  Treatment Correction of secondary carnitine depletion= Like many other organic acidemias, GA1 causes carnitine depletion. Whole-blood carnitine can be raised by oral supplementation. However, this does not significantly change blood concentrations of glutarylcarnitine or esterified carnitine, suggesting that oral supplementation is suboptimal in raising tissue levels of carnitine. In the field of clinical nutrition, researchers come to the same conclusion, that oral carnitine raises plasma levels but doesn't affect muscle carnitine, where most of it is stored and used. * In contrast, regular intravenous infusions of carnitine caused distinct clinical improvements: \\"decreased frequency of decompensations, improved growth, improved muscle strength and decreased reliance on medical foods with liberalization of protein intake.\\" * Choline increases carnitine uptake and retention. Choline supplements are inexpensive, safe (probably even in all children requiring anticholinergics) and can provide spectacular evidence of the suboptimal efficiency of carnitine supplementation by increasing exercise tolerance, truncal tone and general well-being. =Precursor restriction= Dietary control may help limit progression of the neurological damage. Selective precursor restriction=Tryptophan= Formulas such as XLys, XTrp Analog, XLys, XTrp Maxamaid, XLys, XTrp Maxamum or Glutarex 1 are designed to provide amino acids other than lysine and tryptophan, in order to tentatively prevent protein malnutrition. The entry of tryptophan to the brain is crucial in the proper synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. One way to acutely cause depression or bulimia or anxiety in humans, in order to assess an individual's vulnerability to those disorders, is to supplement with a formula with all or most amino acids except tryptophan. The protein synthesis elicited by the amino acids leads circulating amino acids, including tryptophan, to be incorporated into proteins. Tryptophan thus lowers in the brain as a result of the protein synthesis enhancement (causing circulating tryptophan to lower more than other amino acids), and perhaps also competition of large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood–brain barrier through the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LNAA1). The consequence is acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in the brain and a consecutive lowering of serotonin synthesis. ATD, which is basically a diagnostic procedure, is not a treatment for GA1. In the Amish community, where GA1 is overrepresented (Morton, 2003), patients with GA1 did not and still don't receive tryptophan-free formulas, neither as the sole source of amino acids, nor as a supplement to protein restriction. Doctor D. Holmes Morton, the 1993 Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism laureate, is taking care of patients affected with GA1 and other metabolic diseases in this community in his Clinic for Special Children. 5-hydroxytryptophan, the precursor of serotonin that is not metabolized to glutaryl-CoA, glutaric acid and secondary metabolites, could be used as an adjunct to selective tryptophan restriction, considering the risks associated with the procedure. However, the evidence in favour of selective tryptophan restriction remains insufficient and the consensus evolves towards the restriction of lysine only. =Lysine= Lysine restriction, as well as carnitine supplementation, are considered the best predictors of a good prognosis for GA1. This excludes, however, patients who already suffered an encephalopathic crisis, for whom the prognosis is more related to the treatment of their acquired disorder (striatal necrosis, frontotemporal atrophy). Protein restriction Vegetarian diets and, for younger children, breastfeeding are common ways to limit protein intake without endangering tryptophan transport to the brain. =Enhancement of precursor's anabolic pathway=Lysine and hydroxylysine anabolic pathway enhancement A possible way to prevent the build-up of metabolites is to limit lysine and hydroxylysine degradation, as lysine is one of the most abundant amino acids and tryptophan is one of the least abundant amino acids. =Interaction of GCDH deficiency with GLO deficiency= While GCDH deficiency is a rare disease, GLO deficiency is the most common of metabolic diseases affecting children, limiting ascorbic acid biosynthesis to a minute fraction of what other non-primate species synthesize. It was thus called by OMIM (Online Mendeleian Inheritance in Man) a \\"public\\" error of metabolism. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is a necessary cofactor for the utilization of lysine in collagen synthesis. Collagen, the most abundant protein in the human body, requires great amounts of lysine, the most abundant amino acids in proteins. Ascorbic acid, the main hydroxyl radical quencher, works as the cofactor providing the hydroxyl radical required to collagen cross-linking; lysine thus becomes hydroxylysine. GA1 worsens during stresses and catabolic episodes, such as fasts and infections. Endogenous catabolism of proteins could be an important route for glutaric acid production. It thus follows that collagen breakdown (and protein breakdown in general) should be prevented by all possible means. Ascorbic acid is used to prevent multiple organ failure and to lessen mortality and morbidity in intensive care units. It thus appears reasonable to include sufficient doses of ascorbic acid to the treatment protocol during stresses and other challenges to growth in order to stimulate collagen synthesis and thus prevent lysine breakdown. Tryptophan anabolic pathway enhancement The conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and other metabolites depends on vitamin B6. If tryptophan catabolism has any impact on brain glutaric acid and other catabolite levels, vitamin B6 levels should be routinely assayed and normalized in the course of the treatment of GA1. Management of intercurrent illnesses Stress caused by infection, fever or other demands on the body may lead to worsening of the signs and symptoms, with only partial recovery.  Prognosis  A 2006 study of 279 patients found that of those with symptoms (185, 66%), 95% had suffered an encephalopathic crises usually with following brain damage. Of the persons in the study, 49 children died and the median age of death was 6.6 years. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the data estimated that about 50% of symptomatic cases would die by the age of 25. More recent studies provide an updated prognosis where individuals affected can, through proper dietary management and carnitine supplementation, manage the disease with a much improved prognosis. Newborn screening has allowed affected patients to avoid crises and live full lives without any injury to the brain. It is essential that victims of the disease be diagnosed at birth or pre-birth and that all variables be strictly managed in order to maintain quality of life. When suspected and in the absence of confirmed diagnosis (through genetic sequencing), it is critical that the individual maintain a diet restrictive of all proteins and that blood sugars be monitored rigorously. The WHO now considers this disease entirely manageable. Epidemiology GA1 can be described as a metabolic disorder, a neurometabolic disease, a cerebral palsy or a basal ganglia disorder (it is also misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome). Depending on the paradigm adopted, GA1 will mostly be managed with precursor restriction or with neurorehabilitation. So-called \\"orphan diseases\\", such as GA1, can be adopted into wider groups of diseases (such as carnitine deficiency diseases, cerebral palsies of diverse origins, basal ganglia disorders, and others); Morton at al. (2003b) emphasize that acute striatal necrosis is a distinctive pathologic feature of at least 20 other disorders of very different etiologies (e.g. HIV encephalopathy-AIDS dementia complex, pneumococcal meningitis, hypoadrenal crisis, methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion, hypertensive vasculopathy, acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, 3-nitropropionic acid intoxication, late onset familial dystonia, cerebrovascular abrupt and severe neonatal asphyxia (\\"selective neuronal necrosis\\")). Amongst 279 patients who had been reported to have GA1, 185 were symptomatic (two thirds); being symptomatic was seen as an indication of \\"low treatment efficacy\\". High risk screening, neonatal screening and a diagnosis of macrocephaly were the ways to identify bearers of the GCDH' defective gene who weren't frankly symptomatic. Macrocephaly remains the main sign of GA1 for those who aren't related to GA1 in any way or benefit from no screening program. GA1 was considered as a \\"treatable disease\\". Two thirds of the patients who have GA1 will receive little benefit from the treatment for GA1 but can benefit from treatments given to victims of middle cerebral artery occlusion, AIDS dementia and other basal ganglia disorders: brain implants, stem cell neurorestoration, growth factors, monoaminergic agents, and many other neurorehabilitation strategies.

Pre-professional career Mickey McDermott was the third son of Maurice McDermott, Sr., a police officer and former minor league baseball player. Maurice, replaced at first base on the Hartford Senators in the Eastern League by Lou Gehrig, had determined one of his three sons would grow up to be a baseball player and fulfill his dream, though his first-born son, Jimmy, died at the age of seven and his second son, Billy, was born with deformed legs. McDermott started playing first base, his father's position, until his coach at St. Mary's Grammar School noticed that his ball had a natural curve when thrown. By the time he was playing in the parochial school league for St. Patrick's High, he was averaging twenty strikeouts per game. McDermott played for the semi-pro Ferrara Trucking Company at the age of 13 against adults and some major league baseball players moonlighting to pick up some extra money. He went to his first tryout, also at the age of 13, with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Mule Haas, a scout for the Dodgers, said that he wanted to sign McDermott, but because of his age it was illegal. At the age of 15, his father changed his birth certificate to make it appear as though Mickey was 18 years old. Joe Cronin, general manager of the Red Sox, did some research and found out McDermott was only 15. Cronin and McDermott's father worked it out so that McDermott's father got a $5,000 signing bonus and two truck loads of Ballantine Beer for McDermott. Professional careerMinor leagues= McDermott was assigned to the Red Sox' Double A affiliate, the Scranton Red Sox of the Eastern League. He ended the season with a 16–6 record and a 3.29 ERA, with 136 strikeouts in 175 innings. On July 14, 1946, at the age of 17, McDermott threw a no-hitter against the Albany Senators, making him possibly the youngest pitcher to throw a no-hit game in the high minors. The following season, McDermott was promoted to Boston's Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Colonels, where he struggled with his control. Subsequently, he was sent back to Scranton to work on his mechanics. In Scranton, he discovered his form, going 12–4 with four shutouts for the rest of the season, averaging almost one strikeout per inning. During the playoffs, McDermott, threw his second minor league no-hitter. Playing at home against the Utica Blue Sox, McDermott walked Richie Ashburn in the ninth inning. Ashburn took second on a fielders's choice and reached third on a sacrifice fly. With two outs, the catcher called for a curve, but McDermott missed the sign and threw a fastball. The catcher, expecting a curve, failed to catch the ball as it went sailing past him. Ashburn scored the only run of the game to give Utica the victory and McDermott the no-hit loss. =Major leagues= Norman Rockwell's \\"The Rookie\\", a picture based on McDermott making the Red Sox roster. Figuring prominently in the work, right of center, is \\"the rookie\\", who was actually Sherman Safford, a high school athlete in Pittsfield, Massachusetts asked to model for the painting. McDermott made it onto the Red Sox roster for the beginning of the 1948 season, appearing in seven games during the first two months of the season, mostly in lopsided losses. In 23 innings, he had 16 strikeouts and 35 walks, thus was returned to Scranton for more seasoning. After the minor league season ended, he was recalled when the major league roster expanded for the playoff run. While with Scranton, McDermott threw his third career minor league no-hitter. After 1949 spring training, McDermott was assigned to the Louisville Colonels. On May 24, he struck out 20 St. Paul Saints to set a new American Association record that was never broken (the American Association folded in 1962). Over the next four games after his 20 strikeout performance, he struck out 19, 18, 17 and 19 to set a record for the most strikeouts over a five-game period, 93. Under pressure from sports writers, Boston, which was already eleven games out of first place, brought up McDermott to help their ailing pitching staff. McDermott got his first big league win after Ellis Kinder left the game in the first inning. McDermott pitched eight innings of shutout baseball before being lifted for a reliever. He finished the season with a 5–4 record and two shutouts. On May 29, 1952, McDermott faced 27 batters and fired a one-hitter to beat the Washington Senators, 1–0, at Fenway Park. Mel Hoderlein's fourth-inning single was the only Washington hit and he was thrown out while trying to stretch the hit into a double. His finest season came in 1953 when he went 18–10. The following year, he was traded to the Senators for Jackie Jensen. He finished his career with a 69–69 record playing for several different teams. After he refused to sign with the Tigers for the 1959 season, the Tigers sold his contract to the Dallas Eagles of the Texas League, with whom he also refused to sign. Then Bill Veeck, owner of the triple A Miami Marlins of the International League, signed him to pitch on the same staff as Satchel Paige and Virgil Trucks. While playing winter ball in Cuba in 1959, McDermott's team was at bat when Fidel Castro led the 26th of July Movement that overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista. Several people on the field and in the stands were shot, including McDermott's teammate and future Cincinnati Reds shortstop Leo Cárdenas. McDermott was an excellent hitting pitcher in his 12-year major league career, posting a .252 batting average (156-for-619) with 71 runs, 9 home runs, 74 RBI and 52 bases on balls. He hit .364 for the Red Sox in 1950 and .301 in 1953. He recorded 12 RBI in 1950 and 13 RBI in 1953 and 10 RBI with the Senators in 1955. Before 1961, Detroit gave McDermott his unconditional release. He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals as a free agent. After divorcing his first wife, McDermott met Linda Biggio, who would become his second wife. After being out late one night, he invited Linda to his room. The hotel detective saw her dressed in a Hawaiian muumuu and said, \\"You can't bring that hooker into your room!\\" McDermott punched the detective in the mouth and was subsequently released by the Cardinals. Post-playing career As McDermott's baseball career started winding down, he began to drink more. Eventually, he was drinking every night even when he was scheduled to pitch the next day. After pitching in the minor leagues for a while and taking odd jobs to make ends meet, McDermott's second wife, fed up with his alcoholic ways, divorced him. McDermott was hired by the California Angels in 1967 as an assistant pitching coach and batting practice pitcher. He was let go, with the rest of the coaching staff, after the 1968 season. McDermott was eventually hired by Billy Martin, his former teammate, as a scout for the Oakland A's. McDermott turned in the first A's report on Mark McGwire, who eventually signed with them. McDermott was fired, along with the rest of the coaching staff, when Martin was fired after the 1982 season. McDermott, along with business partner Tino Barzie, started representing baseball players as agents. McDermott would recruit the players, and Barzie would negotiate the contracts. They ended up representing Tony Armas, Mario Guerrero, Alejandro Peña, Candy Maldonado and Marty Barrett. Barzie finally had to end his business relationship with McDermott due to the latter's heavy drinking. McDermott became close friends and drinking companions with Paul Gleason and Jack Kerouac. In 1991, after getting into a car wreck and being sentenced to 60 days in jail for numerous DWI's, McDermott became sober. He gave up drinking in 1991 when he and his wife won $7 million in the Arizona Lottery. Five years later, his wife, Betty, died of breast cancer. McDermott's health was not much better, as he went on to have a defibrillator and pacemaker surgically installed. He wrote a memoir of his playing (and non- playing) days called A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Cooperstown, in which he blamed his health problems on his heavy drinking. McDermott lived long enough to see his book published. It was released in April 2003, and he died on August 7, in Phoenix, from congestive heart failure and colon cancer.

He is best known for composing the Concierto de Aranjuez, a cornerstone of the classical guitar repertoire. Life Rodrigo was born in Sagunto (Valencia), and completely lost his sight at the age of three after contracting diphtheria. He began to study solfège, piano and violin at the age of eight; harmony and composition from the age of 16. Although distinguished by having raised the Spanish guitar to dignity as a universal concert instrument and best known for his guitar music, he never mastered the instrument himself. He wrote his compositions in Braille, and they were transcribed for publication. Rodrigo studied music under Francisco Antich in Valencia and under Paul Dukas at the École Normale de Musique in Paris. After briefly returning to Spain, he went to Paris again to study musicology, first under Maurice Emmanuel and then under André Pirro. His first published compositions date from 1923. In 1943 he received Spain's National Prize for Orchestra for Cinco piezas infantiles (\\"Five Children's Pieces\\"), based on his earlier composition of the same piece for two pianos, premiered by Ricardo Viñes. From 1947 Rodrigo was a professor of music history, holding the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, at Complutense University of Madrid. Notable students include Yüksel Koptagel, Turkish composer and pianist. His most famous work, Concierto de Aranjuez, was composed in 1939 in Paris for the guitarist Regino Sainz de la Maza. In later life he and his wife declared that it was written as a response to the miscarriage of their first child. It is a concerto for guitar and orchestra. The central adagio movement is one of the most recognizable in 20th-century classical music, featuring the interplay of guitar with cor anglais. This movement was later adapted by the jazz arranger Gil Evans for Miles Davis' 1960 album \\"Sketches of Spain\\". The Concerto was adapted by the composer himself for Harp and Orchestra at the request of Nicanor Zabaleta and dedicated to Zabaleta. The success of this concerto led to commissions from a number of prominent soloists, including Nicanor Zabaleta, for whom Rodrigo dedicated his Concierto serenata for Harp and Orchestra, Julian Lloyd Webber, for whom Rodrigo composed his Concierto como un divertimento for cello and orchestra, and James Galway, for whom Rodrigo composed his Concierto pastoral for flute and orchestra. In 1954 Rodrigo composed Fantasía para un gentilhombre at the request of Andrés Segovia. His Concierto Andaluz, for four guitars and orchestra, was commissioned by Celedonio Romero for himself and his three sons. Monument in Aranjuez, SpainArms of the 1st Marquess of the Gardens of Aranjuez None of Rodrigo's works, however, achieved the popular and critical success of the Concierto de Aranjuez and the Fantasia para un gentilhombre. These two works are very often paired in recordings. He was awarded Spain's highest award for composition, the Premio Nacional de Música, in 1983. On 30 December 1991 Rodrigo was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of Marqués de los Jardines de Aranjuez (English: Marquess of the Gardens of Aranjuez). He received the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award—Spain's highest civilian honor—in 1996. He was named Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 1998. He married Victoria Kamhi, a Turkish-born pianist whom he had met in Paris, on 19 January 1933, in Valencia. Their daughter, Cecilia, was born on 27 January 1941. Rodrigo died in 1999 in Madrid at the age of 97, and his daughter succeeded him as Marquesa de los Jardines de Aranjuez. Joaquín Rodrigo and his wife Victoria are buried at the cemetery at Aranjuez.

A tall, wiry left-arm medium pacer known by the sobriquet \\"The Bowler of a Century\\", Allan possessed great spin and a peculiar swerve which he claimed to have developed through his use of boomerangs and waddies growing up amongst Aborigines in the Victorian bush. He was also given the nickname \\"Kangaroo\\" because he would jump like a kangaroo to celebrate taking a wicket. Allan began a lifelong association with the South Melbourne Cricket Club in 1866 when he played for the side in his first ever match. Winning the club bowling average that season, he was quickly recognised as a natural of unusual ability, and in 1867, aged seventeen, made his first-class debut for Victoria against New South Wales, taking a first innings five-wicket haul in a performance described by William Hammersley as \\"unprecedented\\".\\"The Intercolonial Match: Victoria v. New South Wales\\". The Australasian (Melbourne). 28 December 1867. p. 11. Retrieved 10 June 2016. Allan became the mainstay of Victoria's bowling attack, securing extraordinary figures in a series of intercolonial victories, and played havoc with W. G. Grace's touring England XI in 1873–74. Grace offered to employ Allan as a professional, stating that he had never batted against a greater bowler. In 1878, Allan formed part of the first representative Australian cricket team to tour overseas. Dogged by illness for much of the tour, Allan failed to live up to his reputation as he struggled to adapt to England's cool and damp conditions. He played in his only Test match the following year on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, against Lord Harris' All- England Eleven, and had an opportunity to appear in the first ever Test, in 1877, facing James Lillywhite's XI, but controversially opted out at the last moment to attend a funfair in Warrnambool.

Outside sport, Allan worked in the public service as Victoria's Chief Inspector of Vermin Destruction, and strived to protect Australian fauna and flora. Family and early years Allan was born in 1849 at Tooram, a cattle station run by his father John McMahon Allan two miles south of Allansford, near Warrnambool, in the Western District of Victoria, Australia. John was said to have been the first British child born in Heligoland, in 1808, and moved with his parents to Sydney, New South Wales, where his father David Allan, a Scotsman, accepted the post of deputy commissary general during the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie. After spending time at sea aboard a whaler, John overlanded with his brothers Henry and William to the Port Phillip District in the early 1840s to take up pastoral pursuits. Squatting on land east of the Hopkins River in the Western District, John named his property Tooram (most likely derived from an Aboriginal word for \\"good fishing place\\"), and in 1843, married Caroline O'Farrell, sister of Henry O'Farrell, a self-proclaimed Fenian who would go on to shoot the Duke of Edinburgh in Australia's first political assassination attempt. John and Caroline had eight children, Frank being the third. The Allans developed friendly relations with the local Aboriginal people, the Girai wurrung. John became their unofficial protector and served as the honorary correspondent for Warrnambool to the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines.

On the Australians tour of 1878 to England, Allan produced some excellent spells of bowling to take over 200 wickets in all games on the tour. However he was troubled by bouts of sickness from the point of arrival in England as he struggled to adjust to the cold weather. Allan's only Test came against the touring Lord Harris XI in 1879.

Starting off as a goalsneak, he kicked 4 goals in his first season, the most of any player that year. He recalled in old age the dangers associated with the position: \\"The name itself made for trouble; ...

The book was later made into an animated film. Plot The book follows the story of the Bloggs, a couple previously seen in the book Gentleman Jim. One afternoon, the couple hears a message on the radio about an \\"outbreak of hostilities\\" in three days' time. Jim immediately starts construction of a fallout shelter (in accordance with a government-issued Protect and Survive brochure, which he has collected from a public library), while the two reminisce about the Second World War. Their reminiscences are used both for comic effect and to show how the geopolitical situation has changed, but also how nostalgia has blotted out the horrors of war. A constant theme is Jim's optimistic outlook and his unshakeable belief that the government knows what is best and has the situation under full control, coupled with Hilda's attempts to carry on life as normal. During their preparations the action is interrupted by two-page dark illustrations. With the first being a nuclear missile on a launch pad, labelled \\"MEANWHILE, ON A DISTANT PLAIN....\\", the second a squadron of Warthogs, labelled \\"MEANWHILE, IN THE DISTANT SKY....\\", and third a nuclear submarine labelled \\"MEANWHILE, IN A DISTANT OCEAN....\\" The Bloggs soon hear of enemy missiles heading towards England and make it into their shelter before a nuclear explosion. They spend all the first day within the fallout shelter, but leave the shelter on the second day and move about the house, exposing themselves to the radioactive fallout. Undaunted, they try to continue life as normal, as if it was the Second World War again. They find the house to be in shambles, with both the water and the electricity cut off. On the third day, misreading advice given in government leaflets, they come to believe that they must stay in the fallout shelter for just two days rather than two weeks. Thus, they go outside, exposing themselves to a huge amount of radioactive fallout. While out, they notice the smell of cooking meat, unaware that it comes from the burning corpses of their neighbours. Jim and Hilda exhibit considerable confusion regarding the serious nature of what has happened after the nuclear attack; this generates gentle comedy as well as darker elements: amongst them, their obliviousness of the fact that they are probably the only people left of their acquaintance. For instance, they repeatedly state that they should go out and purchase supplies. As the novel progresses and their emergency water supply runs out, they resort to collecting rainwater. Though they are wise to boil it, it is still contaminated with radiation, and thus their situation becomes steadily more hopeless, beginning to suffer more effects of radiation sickness. At first they suffer headaches and shivering, moments after the bomb. Then, from the second day, Hilda suffers from vomiting and diarrhoea. On the fourth day, Hilda's gums begin to bleed, and she is finds blood in her diarrhoea, which they mistake for haemorrhoids. On the fifth day, Jim also shows bleeding gums; both are suffering blue bruising but mistake these for varicose veins. Finally, Hilda's hair begins to fall out. From then on, she insists that they go back into the fallout shelter and wait for help to arrive (though it never does). The book ends on a bleak night, when Hilda insists Jim, who has now lost faith in everything he once believed in, should pray; he begins uttering phrases from Psalm 23, which pleases Hilda. However, forgetting the lines, he switches to The Charge of the Light Brigade, whose militaristic and ironic undertones distress the dying Hilda, who weakly asks him not to continue. Finally, James's voice mumbles away into silence as he finishes the line, \\"...rode the Six Hundred...\\" The paper potato sacks they have wrapped themselves in then darken, in line with their ebb of consciousness, growing debility and ultimate deaths. This is then followed by the final blank white page.  Adaptations  Film = The book was made into an animated film by director Jimmy Murakami in 1986. The couple are voiced by Sir John Mills and Dame Peggy Ashcroft. The soundtrack consists of songs, many with an anti- nuclear theme, by prominent rock musicians and groups, including Roger Waters, Genesis and David Bowie. = Radio = There was also a BBC Radio 4 dramatisation in 1983, with the voices of Peter Sallis and Brenda Bruce. A stage version, created at around the same time, has been performed several times since. Other appearances *The book was mentioned in UK parliamentary discussions, and used to support unilateral disarmament. *\\"Mothers Talk\\", a 1984 song by the British pop group Tears for Fears was partly influenced by the book: ** \\"The song stems from two ideas. One is something that mothers say to their children about pulling faces. They say the child will stay like that when the wind changes. The other idea is inspired by [...] When The Wind Blows\\" —Roland Orzabal * Licensed images from When the Wind Blows appear in the short book Sussex After the Bomb – What Will Happen to Newhaven, Lewes, The Ouse Valley, Seaford, Eastbourne and Brighton published by The Profession for Peace (1984). * The lyrics to the Mansun B-side track When The Wind Blows are based on the graphic novel. * The Iron Maiden song \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" from their 2010 album The Final Frontier is loosely based on the graphic novel. In the song, however, the couple commit suicide thinking the tremors shaking up their hideout is the nuclear Doomsday they had been expecting. They are found like this by a rescue team going through the ruins after what was 'merely' a strong earthquake, on \\"just another day the wild wind blows\\". Critique of preparations for nuclear war After the bombing of Hiroshima, people with patterned clothes were burned where the pattern was darkest. The two pamphlets mentioned in When the Wind Blows are based on actual public information series such as Protect and Survive. These sort of pamphlets go back as far as 1938, when the British government put out a leaflet, The Protection of Your Home Against Air Raids. It was updated after the Second World War to Advising the Householder on Protection against Nuclear Attack which was originally published in 1963, around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Protect and Survive was published in 1980, shortly before Briggs began work on When the Wind Blows. Many of James and Hilda's preparations came directly from the pamphlets: *Page 10 of Protect and Survive provided James with the directions for making the lean-to using doors to protect from radiation. *Page 14 of Advising the Householder demonstrated how whitewashing windows reduces fire damage by reflecting the heat from the nuclear blast. *Page 16 of Protect & Survive illustrated a box of sand for dishwashing. Briggs was not the only one to criticise the pamphlets about preparation for nuclear war. One of the best-known critiques was E. P. Thompson's anti-nuclear paper, Protest and Survive, playing off the Protect and Survive series. Criticisms like Protest and Survive point out the inadequacies of the preparation procedures posed by the pamphlet Protect and Survive. In contrast, by the comic format or graphic novel genre, Briggs is able to depict a more realistic account of the effects of nuclear attack on civilians, like James and Hilda. In When the Wind Blows, James makes reference to the bombing of Hiroshima and uses his knowledge of that event to infer what could happen to him and Hilda and to make sense of his own experience before and after the nuclear attack. Unlike the nuclear preparation pamphlets, Briggs's depictions of James and Hilda's experience with radiation sickness actually align with real accounts.

He plays as a striker. Beginning his career as a trainee at Montpellier HSC, Gnakpa then played for French lower league sides before moving to Spain in 2003 to play in the reserve teams of La Liga sides Racing de Santander and Deportivo Alavés. In 2006, he moved to Switzerland for a short time to play for top-tier club FC Vaduz. He moved to England in 2007 to play for Swindon Town, though never made an appearance. He subsequently signed for Peterborough United, where he was used as a defender, then for Luton Town on a free transfer in 2008. At Luton, Gnakpa received notability for scoring the winning goal in the club's 2009 Football League Trophy Final victory, securing Luton's first success in the competition. Since the 2009–10 season, Gnakpa has been utilised almost solely in a wide position, using his combination of pace, power and crossing to contribute numerous goals and assists. After he received the March player of the month, Gnakpa was named in the Conference Premier team of the season for 2009–10. Gnakpa left Luton at the end of his contract in July 2011, signing for League One side Walsall. Career Gnakpa began as a youth player for Montpellier HSC, then appeared for local sides Marignane and Beaucaire, before moving abroad to play for Racing de Santander B, Deportivo Alavés B and FC Vaduz. In March 2007, Gnakpa was signed on transfer deadline day by Swindon Town boss Paul Sturrock on a short-term contract. Gnakpa failed to play for Swindon's first team, appearing only as an unused substitute in several matches, before he was released at the end of the season. In July 2007, Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson took Gnakpa on trial. He was eventually signed by the club. The \\"Flying Frenchman\\" was quickly made a regular at London Road and with his notoriously strong tackle and terrifying pace he cemented his place in the team. In May 2008, it was reported that Gnakpa had rejected Peterborough's offer of an improved contract following the side's promotion to League One, and would instead search for another club. Reportedly, Gnakpa harboured interested from Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, League Two outfit Luton Town, and Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen. He joined the Hatters prior to the start of the 2008–09 campaign, with the club starting League Two on an unprecedented −30 points. Gnakpa scored his first goal for the Hatters in a 2–1 home defeat to Darlington on 11 October 2008. He scored the only goal of the game in Luton's Football League Trophy area semi-final victory over Colchester United on 16 December 2008. On 5 April 2009, Gnakpa came on as a substitute and scored an extra-time winner as Luton defeated Scunthorpe United 3–2 to win the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium. In that game he was used as a winger, a position where he then played regularly during the 2009–10 season under Harford's successor, Richard Money. On 20 March 2010, Gnakpa scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Ebbsfleet United, then continued his scoring streak with three goals in the next two games. His good form saw him awarded the Conference Premier Player of the Month award for March. In June 2010, Gnakpa was named in the Conference Premier team of the season. Gnakpa continued his form into the next season, scoring 15 goals as Luton finished third in table, securing a play-off place. On 1 July 2011 Gnakpa's contract with Luton ended, and he subsequently signed a one-year deal with League One side Walsall. On 27 January 2012, Gnakpa signed for Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle on a short term contract. Walsall manager Dean Smith said that it was best to move on as Gnakpa wanted more first team appearances. Inverness manager Terry Butcher said that he was delighted he had signed him and that he was pleased to sign him after previously failing to. He was released by Inverness in April having failed to make much of an impact during his stay. On 5 August 2013 it was announced that Claude has signed for I-League side Salgaocar F.C.

Overview  The confectionery was established as Svitoch in 1962 through the merging of various confectionaries, although it traces its history under other names to 1882. In the Soviet era, Svitoch was considered one of the best manufacturers, along with the Rot Front and Babaevsky chocolate factories. After its acquisition by Nestlé in mid-1990s, the company opted to produce more Western-style chocolate with lower cocoa content and was forced to move into middle segment of the market, losing some of its appeal, but gaining greater turnovers. It is unclear how this will affect its future development, though, as dark, highly sophisticated chocolate is becoming increasingly more popular with Ukrainians. This change in strategy provoked a labour dispute in late 1990s. In 2013, Nestlé invested $4.4 million in modernising the Svitoch factory.

Life and times He was born at Zierikzee, Netherlands, about 1405. The strict observance of the Franciscan Rule, upheld and propagated throughout Italy by St. Bernardine of Siena and St. John Capistran, was early introduced into Germany. At twenty Cornelius entered the Franciscan Order in the province of Cologne, which at that time included the greater part of the Netherlands. It was famous for the number and sanctity of its members, among whom were several Scotsmen who had been educated at the universities on the Continent. This revival of the Franciscan life under the guidance of St. Bernardine no doubt came to the knowledge of King James I of Scotland, whose poetic spirit was in harmony with the Franciscan ideal. In 1436 the king requested the superiors of the order that he might have friars of the Observance sent into his kingdom; but it was not until after the provincial chapter of the Observants held at Gouda in 1447, and apparently because of a fresh application by his son King James II, that it was decided to comply with the royal wishes. John Perioche de Mauberg, Vicar-general of the Ultramontine Observants, selected Fr. Cornelius as head of the mission. Fr. Cornelius was accompanied by six associates, of whom at least one, Fr. John Richardson, a graduate of the University of Paris, was a Scot; they were received with enthusiasm by all classes. Within a few years after the arrival of the Observants in Scotland they established nine convents in different towns; the postulants for admission to the order were numerous; youths belonging to the best families renounced the world to embrace the Franciscan life of poverty. Legacy Among those who received the habit from Fr. Cornelius were: Jerome Lindsay, U.J.D., of Paris, son of the Earl of Crawford, commemorated in the Franciscan Martyrology with title of blessed, pre-eminent for his humility, mortification, and spirit of prayer; David Crannok, who was physician to King James II and his consort Queen Margaret; he succeeded Fr. Cornelius in the government of the convents; Robert Keith, renowned for the sanctity of his life, a member of the family of the Earl Marishal; later on Robert Stuart, kinsman of King James V. The General Chapter of the Observants held at Mount- Luzon (Bourbonnais) erected the Scottish convents into a province, and granted it a seal representing St. Bernardine holding a tablet with the Holy Name painted on it and three mitres at his feet, to mark that the Scottish province owed its origin to the companions of the saint. The Scottish Franciscans enjoyed a great reputation throughout Europe for their austere lifestyle. James IV wrote to the pope in 1506 in praise of the Observants in his kingdom and their works. The Scottish province was in a flourishing state when the religious revolution broke out and the convents were destroyed. In 1460 Father John Patrick, Minister Provincial, accompanied by over one hundred fathers, left Scotland for the Netherlands, where they were hospitably recognized and incorporated in the provinces of Holland and Belgium. In 1462 Father Cornelius, worn out by his labours and austerities, left Scotland for his own province of Cologne, where he died in the convent at Antwerp on February 21, 1462. It is said that many miracles took place at his tomb. The writings of Father Cornelius, which consist of Conciones ad populum Scotiae, Sermones ad Fratres, and Epistolas plures, have never been published.

He is best known as the author of one of the earliest codifications of Halakha, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol.  Biography  Moses of Coucy lived in the first half of the thirteenth century. His name suggests he was born or raised in Coucy in Northern France. He was a descendant of a family of distinguished scholars. He was the brother-in-law of Tosafist Shimshon of Sens and Shimshon of Coucy (HaSar MiCoucy).The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series, Pg. 138, 156 He studied under Judah of Paris, and Yehudah HaChasid. Following in the latter's footsteps he traveled through Provence and Spain to strengthen religiosity among the Jews and teaching them the way to serve God. In 1240 he was one of the four rabbis who were required to defend the Talmud, in a public disputation in Paris, and it is likely that the need for a work like the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol was driven by the decrees against the Talmud which had been promulgated in France, and had led to the confiscation and burning of all Talmud manuscripts in 1242.  Works  The Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (in Hebrew: ספר מצוות גדול) (in English: The Great Book of Commandments; abbreviated סמ\\"ג \\"SeMaG\\"), completed in 1247, deals with the 365 negative commandments and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud and the decisions of the Rabbis. \\"SeMaG\\" also contains much non-legal, moralistic teaching. References to the \\"SeMaG\\" are by section (positive or negative commandments) and a number for each commandment within its section. Rabbi Moses' arrangement and presentation are heavily influenced by Maimonides' discussion of the commandments in the Sefer Hamitzvot and by his codification of the Halakha in the Mishneh Torah. However, unlike Maimonides, Rabbi Moses presents lengthy discussions of the different interpretations and legal opinions. He also makes extensive use of other codes, and particularly of the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafot, usually favouring these Ashkenazi traditions over Maimonides. He was also the author of Old Tosafot (תוספות ישנים) to Yoma and of some published in the collection \\"Sugyot HaShas\\" (Berlin, 1736).

Biography Born in Tel Aviv, Gafni was educated in a yeshiva, and later moved to and worked as head of a Kollel in Ofakim. He lives in Bnai Brak, is married, and has three children. Political career He was first elected to the Knesset on Degel HaTorah's list in 1988, and was appointed Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs in Yitzhak Shamir's government in 1990. For the 1992 elections, the party joined Agudat Yisrael in forming an alliance called United Torah Judaism, which won four seats. Although he initially lost his seat, Gafni entered the Knesset in 1994 as part of a rotation agreement between the two factions. A similar arrangement operated after the 1996 elections, with Gafni taking the seat for the first half of the session (i. e., until 1998). Early elections in 1999 meant that Gafni re-appeared in the Knesset sooner than expected. This time, no rotation agreement was in place, so he served his full term, and was re-elected in both 2003 and 2006. When Degel HaTorah split from Agudat Yisrael during the latter stages of the 16th Knesset, Gafni was appointed the party's Parliamentary Group Chairman. In the 18th Knesset, Gafni was the chairman of the Knesset's financial committee.

The range of issues investigated by evolutionary ethics is quite broad. Supporters of evolutionary ethics have claimed that it has important implications in the fields of descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics consists of biological approaches to morality based on the alleged role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as evolutionary psychology, sociobiology, or ethology, and seek to explain certain human moral behaviors, capacities, and tendencies in evolutionary terms. For example, the nearly universal belief that incest is morally wrong might be explained as an evolutionary adaptation that furthered human survival. Normative (or prescriptive) evolutionary ethics, by contrast, seeks not to explain moral behavior, but to justify or debunk certain normative ethical theories or claims. For instance, some proponents of normative evolutionary ethics have argued that evolutionary theory undermines certain widely held views of humans' moral superiority over other animals. Evolutionary metaethics asks how evolutionary theory bears on theories of ethical discourse, the question of whether objective moral values exist, and the possibility of objective moral knowledge. For example, some evolutionary ethicists have appealed to evolutionary theory to defend various forms of moral anti-realism (the claim, roughly, that objective moral facts do not exist) and moral skepticism. History The first notable attempt to explore links between evolution and ethics was made by Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man (1871). In Chapters IV and V of that work Darwin set out to explain the origin of human morality in order to show that there was no absolute gap between man and animals. Darwin sought to show how a refined moral sense, or conscience, could have developed through a natural evolutionary process that began with social instincts rooted in our nature as social animals. Not long after the publication of Darwin's The Descent of Man, evolutionary ethics took a very different—and far more dubious—turn in the form of Social Darwinism. Leading Social Darwinists such as Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner sought to apply the lessons of biological evolution to social and political life. Just as in nature, they claimed, progress occurs through a ruthless process of competitive struggle and \\"survival of the fittest,\\" so human progress will occur only if government allows unrestricted business competition and makes no effort to protect the \\"weak\\" or \\"unfit\\" by means of social welfare laws.Gregory Bassham, The Philosophy Book: From the Vedas to the New Atheists, 250 Milestones in the History of Philosophy. New York: Sterling, 2015, p. 318. Critics such as Thomas Henry Huxley, G. E. Moore, William James, and John Dewey roundly criticized such attempts to draw ethical and political lessons from Darwinism, and by the early decades of the twentieth century Social Darwinism was widely viewed as discredited.Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism in American Thought, rev. ed. Boston: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 203. The modern revival of evolutionary ethics owes much to E. O. Wilson's 1975 book, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. In that work, Wilson argues that there is a genetic basis for a wide variety of human and nonhuman social behaviors. In recent decades, evolutionary ethics has become a lively topic of debate in both scientific and philosophical circles. Descriptive evolutionary ethics The most widely accepted form of evolutionary ethics is descriptive evolutionary ethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics seeks to explain various kinds of moral phenomena wholly or partly in genetic terms. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, conservation ethics, an innate sense of fairness, a capacity for normative guidance, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, incest-avoidance, parental care, in-group loyalty, monogamy, feelings related to competitiveness and retribution, moral \\"cheating,\\" and hypocrisy. A key issue in evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved, in both humans and nonhumans, when the process of natural selection is based on the multiplication over time only of those genes that adapt better to changes in the environment of the species. Theories addressing this have included kin selection, group selection, and reciprocal altruism (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). Descriptive evolutionary ethicists have also debated whether various types of moral phenomena should be seen as adaptations which have evolved because of their direct adaptive benefits, or spin-offs that evolved as side-effects of adaptive behaviors. Normative evolutionary ethics Normative evolutionary ethics is the most controversial branch of evolutionary ethics. Normative evolutionary ethics aims at defining which acts are right or wrong, and which things are good or bad, in evolutionary terms. It is not merely describing, but it is prescribing goals, values and obligations. Social Darwinism, discussed above, is the most historically influential version of normative evolutionary ethics. As philosopher G. E. Moore famously argued, many early versions of normative evolutionary ethics seemed to commit a logical mistake that Moore dubbed the naturalistic fallacy. This was the mistake of defining a normative property, such as goodness, in terms of some non-normative, naturalistic property, such as pleasure or survival. More sophisticated forms of normative evolutionary ethics need not commit either the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. But all varieties of normative evolutionary ethics face the difficult challenge of explaining how evolutionary facts can have normative authority for rational agents. \\"Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able?\\"Fitzpatrick, \\"Morality and Evolutionary Biology,\\" Section 3.2.  Evolutionary metaethics  Evolutionary theory may not be able to tell us what is morally right or wrong, but it might be able to illuminate our use of moral language, or to cast doubt on the existence of objective moral facts or the possibility of moral knowledge. Evolutionary ethicists such as Michael Ruse, E. O. Wilson, Richard Joyce, and Sharon Street have defended such claims. Some philosophers who support evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine views of human well-being that rely upon Aristotelian teleology, or other goal-directed accounts of human flourishing. A number of thinkers have appealed to evolutionary theory in an attempt to debunk moral realism or support moral skepticism. Sharon Street is one prominent ethicist who argues that evolutionary psychology undercuts moral realism. According to Street, human moral decision-making is \\"thoroughly saturated\\" with evolutionary influences. Natural selection, she argues, would have rewarded moral dispositions that increased fitness, not ones that track moral truths, should they exist. It would be a remarkable and unlikely coincidence if \\"morally blind\\" ethical traits aimed solely at survival and reproduction aligned closely with independent moral truths. So we cannot be confident that our moral beliefs accurately track objective moral truth. Consequently, realism forces us to embrace moral skepticism. Such skepticism, Street claims, is implausible. So we should reject realism and instead embrace some antirealist view that allows for rationally justified moral beliefs.Sharon Street, \\"A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value.\\" Philosophical Studies, 127: 109–66. Defenders of moral realism have offered two sorts of replies. One is to deny that evolved moral responses would likely diverge sharply from moral truth. According to David Copp, for example, evolution would favor moral responses that promote social peace, harmony, and cooperation. But such qualities are precisely those that lie at the core of any plausible theory of objective moral truth. So Street's alleged \\"dilemma\\"—deny evolution or embrace moral skepticism—is a false choice.David Copp, \\"Darwinian Skepticism about Moral Realism.\\" Philosophical Issues, 18: 186–206. A second response to Street is to deny that morality is as \\"saturated\\" with evolutionary influences as Street claims. William Fitzpatrick, for instance, argues that \\"[e]ven if there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs.\\"Fitzpatrick, \\"Morality and Evolutionary Biology,\\" Section 4.1. The wide variability of moral codes, both across cultures and historical time periods, is difficult to explain if morality is as pervasively shaped by genetic factors as Street claims. Another common argument evolutionary ethicists use to debunk moral realism is to claim that the success of evolutionary psychology in explaining human ethical responses makes the notion of moral truth \\"explanatorily superfluous.\\" If we can fully explain, for example, why parents naturally love and care for their children in purely evolutionary terms, there is no need to invoke any \\"spooky\\" realist moral truths to do any explanatory work. Thus, for reasons of theoretical simplicity we should not posit the existence of such truths and, instead, should explain the widely held belief in objective moral truth as \\"an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes in order to get us to cooperate with one another (so that our genes survive).\\"Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, \\"The Evolution of Ethics.\\" New Scientist, 102: 1478 (17 October 1985): 51–52. Here again the central question is whether the influence of evolution on morality is as pervasive as the critics of moral realism claim. If, as seems likely, there are important aspects of morality that cannot be explained in genetic terms, appeals to moral truth may provide genuine explanation of these aspects.

Biography He was educated at the Jewish Theological Seminary and the University in Breslau. In 1874 he was appointed docent at the Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums in Berlin, and in 1883, on the death of David Joël, he was called to the seminary at Breslau. Lewy's knowledge of Talmudic literature was unusually wide; he was endowed also with an exceptionally acute and dispassionate critical spirit and with a faculty for grasping the proper importance of details. His first publication was Ueber einige Fragmente aus der Mischna des Abba Saul (Berlin, 1876), in which he showed that the Mishnah collections of the foremost teachers in the period before the final redaction of the Mishnah itself, including that of Abba Saul, agreed as regards all the essential points of the Halakha. Ein Wort über die Mechilta des R. Simon (Breslau, 1889) was likewise an authoritative work in the field of halakhic exegesis. Lewy also published Interpretation des ersten, zweiten und dritten Abschnitts des Palästinischen Talmud-Traktates Nesikin (ib. 1895–1902), and Ein Vortrag über das Ritual des Pesach-Abends (ib. 1904). His work and publications later became fundamental cornerstones for the Talmudic studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and from there to all modern day Talmudic studies, being the first to methodically and meticulously gather sources and versions of the words of Jewish sages leading to their origins.Hebrew University publications: Y.N.

In fact, it would probably be a more fitting name for the order (Seder, one of six sections of the Mishna and Tosefta) itself which is called Nezikin although besides damages it includes court laws, punitive laws, and moral laws. But his main proof was shown to be stemmed from a mistake and most sources point to the fact that both the order and the tractate where referred to as Nezikin.Epstein, followed by Sussman, and recently Sherlo References * About Lewy Israel on the now online Jewish Encyclopedia External links * * Hebrew translation of the prolog for his interpretation of the Jerusalem Talmud tractate Nezikin Only Bava Kama was published, in a series of articles in the yearbooks (Jahrbricht) of the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau from 1895 till 1914.

Bannerman made his Test debut at Melbourne in 1879, joining brother Charles, his senior by eight years, in the Australian team. \\"Little Alick\\" was a small man, his lack of size matched only by his frequent lack of run-scoring. Whereas Charles was an attacking stroke-maker, Alick was ultra- defensive, almost strokeless at times. His nickname, in contrast to that of his brother (the \\"Pocket Hercules\\"), was \\"Barn Door\\". A.G. Moyes provides this piece of Bannerman imagery in Australian Batsmen: \\"At times the crowd found him as wearisome to the flesh as fleas in a warm bed.\\" Wisden Cricketers' Almanack dubbed him \\"the most famous of all stone-walling batsmen; his patience was inexhaustible.\\" In his first Test, Alick top-scored (as Charles had memorably done on his debut in 1876/77, hitting 165) with 73. Alick went to England in 1878 and 1880 as much for his ability in the field as for his batting. He excelled at mid-off, \\"fast, sure, and untiring, and a wonderfully safe catch,\\" according to Sydney Pardon. In the one hastily arranged Test Match played at the Oval that year (the first ever on British soil), he took Charles's place as Australian opener and scored the first Test run in England, just as the older Bannerman brother had taken the first (off Alfred Shaw) in Australia almost four years before. In the 28 Tests that Bannerman played from then until 1893, he scored 1,108 runs at an average of 23.03, without ever scoring a hundred. He often found his steady defence coupled at the top of the order with the aggression of such partners as Hugh Massie, George Bonnor, Percy McDonnell and J.J. Lyons. With Lyons at Sydney in the 1891/92 Ashes series, Bannerman played a crucial role in securing the Test (and thus the series) for Australia, who had trailed on the first innings by 163 runs. In the home team's second innings, Lyons and Bannerman put on 174 for the first wicket in 7½ hours, scoring 134 and 91 respectively. Bannerman's knock spanned three days, scoring at a rate of twelve runs an hour. As the bowlers of his time bowled almost twice the number of overs in an hour that they do now, his cumbersome scoring is astonishing. The admittedly accurate William Attewell bowled 204 balls to him during this innings, only five of which brought runs. The frustrated crowd was moved to barracking (the polite sort: they always referred to him as \\"Good old Alick\\") and one poet to verse: :O Bannerman, O Bannerman, :We wish you'd change your manner, man; :We pay our humble tanner, man, :To see a bit of fun. :You're a beggar though to stick it, :But it ain't our sort of cricket; :They haven't hit your wicket, :Yet, you haven't got a run. The subject of this none-too-flattering ditty was not at all bothered. \\"Like Gallio of old,\\" wrote Moyes, \\"he cared for none of these things, concentrating entirely on the job in hand [....] He could irritate, but never overawe, and two of him would have riled even a modern Job.\\" In the Melbourne Test Match of that 1891/92 series, Bannerman occupied the crease for a total of 7¼ hours, making 45 and 41. This came before his famous knock at Sydney, which reduced him to an average of eleven runs an hour from his last three innings. He could, however, be even slower: during a New South Wales-versus- Victoria fixture in 1890, Bannerman managed 45 not out in 5½ hours. In all matches between the two sides, he scored 1,209 runs for an average of 29.29. Even the most passive wielders of the willow wand find them waving it about gaily on occasion, and Bannerman was no exception, with the first Sydney Test of Ivo Bligh's 1882/83 tour the most notable example. Going into the match, Australia was two-one down in the series, and it simply had to win this one. A Bannerman edge was spilt, and he decided, on the back of such fortune, to go on the offensive, hitting out in cavalier fashion for a delightfully short innings of 63. In the third Test of that series (at Sydney again), he made his highest Test score of 94. He had been 68 not out at the close of the second day. As R.D. Beeson, in his book St Ivo and The Ashes (Australia Press Agency, 1883), wrote of his efforts on that evening, \\"This performance, on such a sodden wicket, was a truly memorable one; and the plucky little batsman was warmly applauded.\\" All in all, Bannerman made six trips to England, and he enjoyed the actual touring of the Mother Country just as much as he did playing cricket there; indeed, many of his most memorable experiences occurred in places where his contribution on the field was negligible. He played in three of the most historically important matches of his era – the match with the M.C.C. in 1878 that the Australians won in less than a day, that first- ever Test in 1880 and the Ashes-igniter at the Oval in 1882, in which he had one of the better games amongst the batsmen, scoring nine for a strike-rate of 10.34 in the first innings, and a boundary-less thirteen from an hour and ten minutes in the second, holding up one end while Massie launched his famous assault from the other. In the 1888 Test Match at the Oval, George Lohmann took what Pardon thought was \\"the finest of all the catches at cover slip ever brought off by George Lohmann\\". Bannerman could hardly believe his luck, and he went on about it for the rest of the afternoon. Like his brother had done when his playing days had come to a premature close, Alick took to coaching and umpiring, at which Charles was definitely more controversial and erratic. Alick, meanwhile, was a big traditionalist throughout his days when it came to etiquette and the like, and he took his cricket very seriously. On one occasion, a colleague of his was belting out a catchy number on the field. Alick, unable to endure it any longer, went over to him and read the riot act: \\"If you want to play cricket, play it; if you want to sing, go and sing; but, for Heaven's sake, don't sing comic songs in the slips!\\" He spent much of his later days coaching at the S.C.G. for the New South Wales Cricket Association, and watching closely the progress of any new player whom he had taken under his wing. He also paid close attention to his overall dress and appearance. If he took exception to this, the youngster would know it. \\"Son,\\" he would tell him. \\"if you are not a cricketer, you can at least look like one.\\" He died on 19 September 1924, aged 70 and his funeral proceeded from St Michael's Church in Darlinghurst to the Waverley Cemetery. As his Wisden obituary observed, \\"Alec Bannerman will be remembered as long as cricket is played\\".

In some patent law frameworks, however, such as in the European Patent Convention (EPC) and its case law, no explicit, accurate definition of who exactly is an inventor is provided. The definition may slightly vary from one European country to another. Inventorship is generally not considered to be a patentability criterion under European patent law. Under U.S. case law, an inventor is the one with \\"intellectual domination\\"Morse v. Porter, 155 USPQ 280, 283 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1965) over the inventive process, and not merely one who assists in its reduction to practice. Since inventorship relates to the claims in a patent application, knowing who an inventor is under the patent law is sometimes difficult. In fact, inventorship can change during the prosecution of a patent application as claims are deleted or amended. \\"Joint inventors\\", or \\"co- inventors\\", exist when a patentable invention is the result of inventive work of more than one inventor. Joint inventors exist even where one inventor contributed a majority of the work. Absent a contract or license, the inventors are individuals who own the rights in an issued patent. Status as an inventor dramatically alters parties' ability to capitalize on the invention.Ethicon v. United States Surgical Corp., 135 F.3d 1456, 45 U.S.P.Q.2d 1545 (Fed.

Indeed, \\"[f]or the purposes of proceedings before the [EPO], the applicant shall be deemed to be entitled to exercise the right to the European patent\\". Court actions relating to the entitlement to the grant of a European patent must be brought before the national court which has the jurisdiction. The jurisdiction is determined in conformance with the \\"Protocol on Jurisdiction and the Recognition of Decisions in respect of the Right to the Grant of a European Patent\\" or, in short, the \\"Protocol on Recognition\\".EPO web site, Protocol on Jurisdiction and the Recognition of Decisions in respect of the Right to the Grant of a European Patent (Protocol on Recognition) of 5 October 1973 Once a final decision is issued by a national court adjudging that the applicant is not entitled to the grant of a European patent, the procedure according to is applicable. In contrast with U.S. patent law, the applicant for a European patent need not be the inventor. The right to the European patent may validly be transferred before the filing of the application, e.g. by contract, by inheritance, or as a consequence of the \\"employee's rights\\" as determined by the applicable national law. However, the inventor has the right to be mentioned as such before the EPO. The EPO does not verify the accuracy of the designation of the inventor. (previously ) The inventor may waive its right to be mentioned as such in the European patent application and European patent specification. (previously ) Inventorship is traditionally not classified as a patentability criterion under European patent law, in contrast with U.S. patent law. However, inventorship can be relevant to patentability in Europe, although in only a limited way. Where a disclosure is made within 6 months preceding the filing date of a European patent application, the disclosure is not taken into consideration if it was due to, or in consequence of, an evident abuse in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor. Thus the identity of the inventor (who is often the applicant, or their legal predecessor) can be of vital importance. =United States= In the United States, before the Leahy- Smith America Invents Act (AIA), the inventor or joint inventors had to be named as the applicants. However, under the AIA, that is no longer the only option. This requirement that a patent be issued in the name of the inventors is derived from the intellectual property clause of the United States Constitution: > The Congress shall have power . . . To promote the progress of science and > useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the > exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. (emphasis > added) An inventor is a party who conceived (not just contributed to the reduction- to-practice) at least one claim to a patent. The courts explain that \\"[t]he threshold question\\" of inventorship is \\"who conceived the invention.\\" Courts recognize that invention is rarely a solitary endeavor. Therefore, conception and \\"intellectual domination\\" over an invention is important and \\"reduction to practice, per se, is irrelevant. One must contribute to the conception to be an inventor.\\" For example, in 1991, consumer group Public Citizen sued the owners of the patent for use of the anti-retroviral compound AZT against HIV Aids, Burroughs-Wellcome. The plaintiffs claimed that several persons at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who had contributed to the patentable subject matter were not named as \\"inventors.\\" Controversially, the courts ultimately ruled that the original patent was valid, and no error had been made in excluding the NIH researchers whose work only 'confirmed' the invention. Generally, conception is \\"the complete performance of the mental part of the inventive act\\", and \\"the formation in the mind of the inventor of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter to be applied in practice..\\" (emphasis added).Townsend v. Smith, 36 F.2d 292, 295, 4 USPQ 269, 271 (CCPA 1930) An idea is usually not \\"definite and permanent\\" or \\"complete\\" where changes result from experimentation. In this case, other individuals who contribute to the formation of the \\"definite and permanent\\" idea are co-inventors. The naming of inventors is very important for the validity of the patent. Failing to name, or incorrectly identifying inventors, with deceptive intent, can result in a patent being held invalid or unenforceable for inequitable conduct.\\"Why listing all inventors is crucial to protecting an invention,\\" Dallas Business Journal, March 5, 2019 Ordinarily, the courts presume the named inventors are the inventors so long as there is no disagreement. An inventor cannot opt out from being mentioned as such in a U.S. patent, even if the patent application was assigned before publication. Assignment of rights in a patent does not alter to whom the patent is actually issued. In fact, an assignee may only have an equitable interest in the patent until it is issued and then legal interest would transfer automatically. If the inventor is dead, insane, or otherwise legally incapacitated, refuses to execute an application, or cannot be found, an application may be made by someone other than the inventor. An omitted inventor can file lawsuit to have his/her name added to the list of the inventors. Such cases arise very often in Universities: see, for example, Chou v University of Chicago and Olusegun Falana v. Kent State University and Alexander J. Seed. In 2019-2020, the USPTO has grappled with the question of whether an artificial intelligence machine can be an inventor.https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/16524350_22apr2020.pdf In a recent patent application, the USPTO rejected artificial intelligence machines as inventors, but has also sought comments from the public. The American Intellectual Property Law Association has come out against a change in the law until the topic is better understood, but others have suggested temporary measures to collect relevant information until Congress takes up the issue.https://www.aipla.org/docs/default- source/advocacy/documents/aiplacomments_uspto_rfc_patentingai2019nov08.pdf?sfvrsn=b1945306_0 Compensation of inventors There are many ways in which an inventor might be compensated for a patent. An inventor might bring the patented product to market under the protection of the monopoly created by the patent. The inventor may license a patent to another entity for an up-front fee, an ongoing royalty or other consideration. The inventor may also sell the patent outright. Henry Woodward, for example, sold his original US patent on the light bulb to Thomas Edison who then developed it into a commercially successful product. Inventors who are employees of a company generally sell or assign their patent rights to the company they work for. The extent to which they are compensated will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may depend upon any prior employment agreements that are in place. Under Japanese patent law, for example, an employee is entitled to a “reasonable fee\\" for an invention. In 2006 Hitachi was ordered to pay an employee $US 1.6 million for an invention the employee made that was commercially valuable.Morton, Jeremy, “Employee Compensation in Europe” Insurance IP Bulletin, August 2007 In United States, however, an employee may have to sign over the rights to an invention without any special compensation. Germany has a law on employees' inventions providing strict rules concerning the transfer of rights to an invention to the employer. It also prescribes mandatory compensation of employees for inventions they make. This right to compensation cannot be waived in advance, i.e. before the employer is informed of an invention.Sec. 22 Employees' Inventions Act See also *Projector (patent) ReferencesExternal links * M.P.E.P. 2100 - Inventorship Category:Patent law ","title":"Inventor (patent)"},{"id":"2490265","text":"If Japan can ... Why can't we? was an American television episode broadcast by NBC News as part of the television show \\"NBC White Paper\\" on June 24, 1980, credited with beginning the Quality Revolution and introducing the methods of W. Edwards Deming to American managers that was produced by Clare Crawford- MasonClare Crawford-Mason, Senior Producer and reported on by Lloyd Dobyns.Lloyd Dobyns, Reporter The report details how the Japanese captured the world automotive and electronics markets by following Deming's advice to practice continual improvement and think of manufacturing as a system, not as bits or pieces. Crawford-Mason went on to produce; in collaboration with Deming, a 14 hour documentary series detailing his methods through lecture excerpts, interviews, practical demonstrations, and case studies of companies that adopted his methods. Background During the 1980s, Japan was seen to be a manufacturing powerhouse while American industry was struggling to keep pace. It was strongly believed that Japanese manufacturing techniques were uniquely developed for and suited to the Japanese culture, and thus unsuited for American culture. Excerpts Lloyd Dobyns (narrator): We have said several times that much of what the Japanese are doing is what we taught them to do. And the man who did most of the teaching is W. Edwards Deming, statistical analyst, for whom Japan's highest industrial award for quality and productivity is named. But in his own country he is not widely recognized. That may be changing. Dr Deming is working with Nashua Corporation, one of the Fortune 500, a company with sales last year of more than $600,000,000. Deming was hired in late 1979 by Nashua’s Chief executive, William E. Conway. Bill Conway: And of course our major supplier of copier machines was a Japanese company. And so we saw the advantages of how many things the Japanese companies were doing. And we heard about Dr Deming. And so we got under way with our quality program with Dr Deming. Dr Deming: They realized that the gains that you get by statistical methods are gains that you get without new machinery, without new people. Anybody can produce quality if he lowers his production rate. That is not what I am talking about. Statistical thinking and statistical methods are to Japanese production workers, foremen, and all the way through the company, a second language. In statistical control you have a reproducible product hour after hour, day after day. And see how comforting that is to management: they now know what they can produce, they know what their costs are going to be. Bill Conway: Many of these programs on statistics have died in American companies because they didn't get the top management support. Now, why top management does not believe that this is the way the Japanese have improved their industry over the last 30 years I don't know. Dr Deming: I think that people here expect miracles. American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan—but they don't know what to copy! Lloyd Dobyns: But one part of Deming’s program is not likely to please them. He insists that management causes 85% of all the problems. Dr Deming: I ask people in management what proportion of this problem arises from your production worker. And the answer is always: All of it! That’s absolutely wrong. There’s nobody that comes out of a School of Business that knows what management is, or what its deficiencies are. There’s no one coming out of a School of Business that ever heard of the answers that I'm giving your questions—or probably even thought of the questions. Accolades If Japan Can...

She was named for Annapolis, Maryland. Annapolis was laid down on 18 April 1896 at Elizabethport, New Jersey, by Lewis Nixon and his shipyard superintendent, Arthur Leopold Busch; launched on 23 December 1896; sponsored by Ms. Georgia Porter, the daughter of Captain Theodoris Porter; and commissioned at New York on 20 July 1897, Commander John J. Hunker in command. Service historySpanish–American War= Following commissioning, the gunboat operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea engaged in training missions. In March 1898, she was assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet. By April, the U.S. was on the verge of war with Spain over conditions in Cuba. On 18 April, the warship departed New York on her way to the Florida coast. She arrived at Key West on the 25th, the day on which President William McKinley signed a joint resolution of Congress that formalized the fact that a state of war had existed between the U.S. and Spain since the 21st. She made a round-trip voyage from Key West to Port Tampa and back before joining the blockade off Havana on 2 May. She remained there for 19 days. On 8 May, she assisted in capturing the Spanish sailing vessel Santiago Apostol, bound from Yucatan to Havana with a cargo of fish. The remainder of that tour passed more or less routinely, and Annapolis retired from Cuban waters on 21 May. She spent eight days at Key West and two weeks at Port Tampa before rejoining the blockade at Daiquiri on 22 June. The following day, the gunboat moved to Guantanamo Bay. On 29 June, while she was on station at Guantanamo Bay with the torpedo boat and cruiser , Annapolis she assisted those ships in the capture of the British steamer Adula. On 13 July, she left the Guantanamo Bay area to make a reconnaissance visit to Baracoa on Cuba's northeastern coast. While at Baracoa on the 15th, she conferred with a group of friendly Cubans and engaged in a brief gun duel with an enemy shore battery near the eastern end of the town. She departed Baracoa that same day and resumed duty at Guantanamo Bay on the 16th. On the 18th, she received orders to help capture Nipe Bay located about up the northeastern coast from Baracoa. Following , , and into the bay on the 21st, Annapolis successfully passed through a known minefield. Inside, the four American ships discovered the lying at anchor inside the bay. After a brisk exchange of fire, the Americans bested the Spanish warship in the resulting Battle of Nipe Bay, and she began to sink. Annapolis and the three other ships set about the tasks of completing the capture of the Nipe Bay littoral and removing the mines from the bay itself. The gunboat departed Nipe Bay on 22 July and set a course for Puerto Rico where she assisted the Army in the capture of the city of Ponce on the 30th. For the remainder of the war, she served at Puerto Rico, making one voyage from that island to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies at the end of the first week in August just before the armistice of 12 August. =Post-war deployment= The Annapolis, photographed by William H. Rau, circa 1898 On 24 August, she departed Puerto Rico and proceeded—via Key West—to the New England coast where she visited Newport, Rhode Island; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and New York City. Late in October, the gunboat headed back to the West Indies where she cruised for the next six months. Annapolis returned to the New England coast late in April 1899 and operated along the eastern seaboard for the next four months. On 5 September, she was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia. She was recommissioned on 14 November 1900, Lieutenant Commander Karl Rohrer in command. At the end of December 1900, she departed Hampton Roads, bound for the Far East. Steaming via the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean, the warship arrived at Cavite in the Philippines on 24 April 1901. She remained in the Far East for the next three years. For the most part, the Philippine Islands constituted her sphere of operations. She conducted patrols, carried passengers and mail among the islands, and supported the Army during the first stage of the Philippine–American War. She also participated extensively in the hydrographic surveys made of the islands. In the summer and fall of 1903, she joined American's Far Eastern fleet for a cruise to Chinese and Japanese waters. During that voyage, she visited Chefoo and Shanghai in China, Kobe and Yokohama in Japan and Tamsui on the island of Formosa before returning to Cavite on 19 November. The gunboat operated in the Philippines for the next three months, but late in February 1904, she returned to Shanghai for a month. After a week of target practice in Chinese waters from 30 March-8 May, Annapolis headed back to the Philippines, arriving in Cavite on 13 May. However, her stay was brief because she departed Cavite again on 2 June and shaped a course via Yokohama back to the U.S. Annapolis reached Mare Island, California later that summer, was decommissioned, and entered the navy yard there for extensive repairs. She was placed back in commission on 25 March 1907, Lt. Cdr. Lewis J. Clark in command, and departed San Francisco, California on 5 April bound—via Hawaii—for American Samoa. The gunboat arrived at Tutuila, Samoa on 22 May and began duty as station ship. She discharged those duties until 9 September 1911, when she departed Pago Pago to return home. The warship made a stop at Honolulu on the way back, arrived at San Francisco on 9 October, and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard later that day. The gunboat was decommissioned once more on 16 December 1911. Annapolis remained at Mare Island until recommissioned on 1 May 1912, Cdr. Warren J. Terhune in command. Sometime in May, the warship moved south to San Diego, California, whence she departed the 21st and headed for the coast of Central America. She arrived at Corinto—off the coast of Nicaragua—on 13 June. Conditions in that Central American republic had been unstable throughout the 1900s but, after 1910, became increasingly worse as three factions vied with each other for power. By the summer of 1912, General Manuel Estrada Cabrera—more or less democratically elected under American auspices—had been forced put of office. His vice president—Adolfo Diaz—took over his duties; but, by the end of July, full-scale civil war raged in Nicaragua. Annapolis returned to the Corinto area on 1 August following a six-week cruise along the coasts of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The gunboat remained at Corinto for the following four months, periodically sending landing parties ashore to protect Americans lives and property and to restore order in areas where Americans were located. On 9 December, she departed Nicaraguan waters to return to San Francisco where, after stops at Acajutla, El Salvador, and at San Diego, she arrived on 30 December. That same day, the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs. She completed repairs late in January 1913 and returned to sea on the 20th. The gunboat made a 16-day stop at San Diego before resuming her voyage to Central American waters on 7 February. Annapolis arrived at Amapala, Honduras on 17 February and remained there until 9 March. After a short cruise to the Gulf of Fonseca and to Petosi in Nicaragua on 9–10 March, she returned to Amapala on the 10th and remained there until 23 April. At that time, she departed the Honduran coast and headed for Mexico where successive coups had unseated first Porfirio Díaz and then his successor Francisco Madero. Gen. Victoriano Huerta seized the reins of government, but others—notably Venustiano Carranza, Emiliano Zapata, Álvaro Obregón, and Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa—contested his usurpation of power and generally added to the mayhem in Mexico. For the next six years, Annapolis patrolled the Mexican coast investigating conditions, protecting American interests, and assisting American refugees. She spent most of her time along the Mexican coast but returned periodically to California for repairs, provisions, and training. In June 1918, she moved through the Panama Canal to begin duty out of New Orleans, Louisiana with the American Patrol. She cruised the waters of the Gulf of Mexico until 25 April 1919, at which time she was detached from the American Patrol. She departed New Orleans early in May and arrived in San Diego later that month. On 1 July, Annapolis was placed out of commission at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Early in 1920, the gunboat was towed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she was turned over to the Pennsylvania Nautical School on 1 April 1920. She served as a school ship, on a loan basis, for the next 20 years.[Independence Seaport Museum Collection of Pennsylvania Nautical School records], Finding aid. Independence Seaport Museum, J. Welles Henderson Archives and Library, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fate On 17 July, when the Navy adopted its alphanumeric system of classification, Annapolis was designated PG-10. On 30 June 1940, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal. Presumably, she was scrapped.

He played for three teams during his five-year career; the Philadelphia White Stockings and the Chicago White Stockings of the National Association, and the Louisville Grays of the National League. However, after admitting to throwing games and costing the Grays the pennant in the 1877 Louisville Grays scandal, he and three of his teammates were banished permanently from Major League Baseball. Career Jim Devlin began his career in the first organized professional league, the National Association, as an infielder for his hometown Philadelphia White Stockings team in 1873, and the Chicago White Stockings in the 1874 and 1875 seasons. In 1876, the National Association folded and was replaced by the National League that lives on to this day. In this year, Devlin began pitching for the Louisville Grays, starting 68 games with an impeccable 1.56 earned run average and leading the Grays in batting with .315. His best pitch was a \\"drop pitch\\", now known as a sinker, which Devlin may have been the first to throw. In 1877, Devlin, the only pitcher on the roster, threw every pitch of his team's 61 games, the only pitcher ever to do so. Banishment Led by Devlin and slugger George Hall, the Grays opened up a four-game lead in the NL pennant race by mid-August. However, the Grays suffered a horrendous road trip and endured a seven-game losing streak, which was characterized by uncharacteristic \\"bonehead\\" plays and poor pitching. The Grays relinquished their lead and eventually finished second, seven games behind the Boston Red Caps (who tore up the league afterwards, winning 20 of 21 games to end the season). Meanwhile, certain Grays were seen around town wearing fancy new jewelry and ostentatiously dining at exclusive restaurants. At the end of the season, suspicion arose that players were being paid to intentionally lose games. This suspicion increased as the players performed very well in post- season exhibition matches and as the Louisville Courier-Journal discovered that utility infielder Al Nichols had received an abnormally high number of telegrams. Courier-Journal writer John Haldeman, who was the son of the team president and sometimes played second base in the team's exhibition games, was the first to publicly accuse the Grays of throwing games. Team vice president Charles Chase, who had earlier received but disregarded telegrams informing him that gamblers were betting against the Grays in certain games, began an investigation. Devlin and Hall confessed, and Chase demanded that his players allow him to inspect their telegrams. The telegrams confirmed that Nichols was coordinating the games with New York gamblers. Bill Craver, the team's shortstop, who was the only player to deny the request, citing lack of pay, and who carried a bad reputation from his days in the National Association, was presumed guilty by association and was suspended. William Hulbert, the president of the National League, decided to make a stand against gambling. He immediately banned Devlin, Hall, Nichols, and Craver for life. Craver, against whom no evidence of gambling has ever been found, was outraged and appealed the suspension. Devlin also appealed to the League for reinstatement every year for the rest of his life. However, Hulbert remained resolute and none of the Louisville Four ever played major league baseball again (according to legend, Devlin literally begged, on his knees, for another chance; Hulbert responded by giving Devlin a fifty-dollar bill (); \\"This is what I think of you personally, Jim\\", the league president supposedly said, \\"[b]ut, damn you, you have thrown a game, you are dishonest, and this National League will not stand for it!\\"). Devlin, who found work in Philadelphia as a police officer, died poor of tuberculosis in 1883 and was survived by a wife and son. He is interred at New Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia.

It was the third novel to feature the character. I, Lucifer introduces parapsychology, a theme that would recur in later books in the Modesty Blaise series. It also introduces the secondary character Steven Collier, parapsychologist, who would make numerous future appearances in both the comic strip and the novels. Plot summary Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin are in Paris. Modesty is being wined and dined by René Vaubois, head of the Deuxième Bureau (the French Intelligence Service), on a floating restaurant on the Seine. René asks Modesty for advice regarding a new protection racket. High-level people worldwide are receiving death threats, and those who don't pay end up dead. The really crazy thing is that most of the deaths are apparently natural deaths. Willie, waiting on the river bank for Modesty's return, encounters Chuli, a criminal whose speciality is planting bombs. René Vaubois' car has been wired with explosives. And when Modesty, Willie, René and Stephen Collier (making his first appearance) leave the scene they are followed by a car full of underworld killers, all bent on putting René down. This is the start of a rather strange story about Lucifer, a \\"young man with a godlike body, dark hair and a ruined mind\\" who had been studying to go into the church when he was seduced by a woman and suffered a nervous breakdown, becoming convinced that he was the source of all sin, and therefore the devil himself. A pair of ageing puppeteers, Seff and Regina, unable to get work when the music halls closed down, turned to crime. After discovering Lucifer's uncanny ability to predict forthcoming natural deaths Seff has created an incredible worldwide protection racket. The action heats up when Modesty is taken prisoner at their base on Sylt and a radio-controlled cyanide capsule is surgically implanted under her skin. The final confrontation takes place on a remote island in the Philippines. First Modesty and Willie are forced to fight a duel to the death against each other. Later the machine guns are blazing in a major battle between good guys and bad, with Modesty risking everything to try and save Lucifer.

History Roshen chocolate. Kyiv Roshen Factory in the New Year 2012 =Ban of exports to the Russian Federation= In July 2013, Russia banned all Roshen imports due to dissatisfaction with the packaging labelling. Soon after Roshen products were also checked in Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova but this did not lead to complaints. On 21 October 2013, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov said, \\"There are no problems with the quality of products, they are safe. But there are problems associated with the production technology, using some ingredients that are not certified in accordance with the law.\\" According to the 17 December 2013 Ukrainian-Russian action plan by 1 March 2014 Roshen products should have been back in Russian stores. But on 12 March 2014, acting head of the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare Anna Popova stated that Ukraine had not yet fulfilled their requirements to return Roshen products to the Russian market. Late March 2014 the Roshen factory in Lipetsk (Russia) was closed down and its local manager director charged with \\"conspiring with unnamed others to use a registered trademark illegally to extract additional profits\\". Ukraine and the factory workers suspected the factory was closed because of Roshen's owner Petro Poroshenko involvement in Euromaidan and his participation in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election. According to Reuters some of the Roshen factory workers in Lipetsk felt embarrassed to work for Ukrainians \\"swept up in a wave of Russian patriotism since Moscow annexed Crimea\\" and gossiped about rumours of how the management \\"paid Ukrainians more money and were cheating the Russians\\". On 13 May 2014 Russia banned the sale of Roshen products in Crimea. In April 2017 full production stopped in the Lipetsk factory; leaving 700 people jobless.Roshen quits activity of its factory in Lipetsk, Interfax-Ukraine (20 January 2017) As noted, the seizure of property of the Lipetsk confectionery factory, imposed by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation under a criminal case, made it impossible to sell the factory. During the election campaign of the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election Roshen owner Poroshenko pledged to sell all his shares in Roshen if elected President; Poroshenko was elected President but by late December 2014 was not able to find a buyer for the company. Because of this in January 2016 Poroshenko transferred his share of the corporation to an independent blind trust. The Bank Ruling Trust has a four-year-old proxy to negotiate the sale of assets. =Production network changes= Roshen closed down its confectionery factory in Mariupol (Ukraine) in 2015 after the Donbass war in the vicinity and an export ban by Russia made production there unviable. The corporation was earlier reported to operate facility in the town of Bershad (Ukraine), but it's not listed on the corporate web site. Since March 2012, Roshen began co-production with a contract manufacturer in Hungary named \\"Bonbonetti\\". Products and brands right \\"ROSHEN\\" is the umbrella brand of all of the corporation's products. The name is a truncated version of Poroshenko, the last name of its owner. ROSHEN produces more than 350 kinds of confectionery products. The product line includes chocolate and jelly sweets, caramel, toffee, chocolate bars, biscuits, wafers, sponge rolls, pastry and cakes. The total volume of production reaches around 300 thousand tons per year. They're most well known for their \\"Kyiv Vechirniy\\" chocolate candy and Kiev cakes, produced by the flagship Kyiv Roshen Factory in Kyiv. The corporation has a wide range of more affordable and less sophisticated products famous for high chocolate content. In 2013 the company manufactured about 200 types of confectionery products and in total produced 410,000 tonnes of products that year.

In 1824, fifteen years after the suppression of his monastery, when there was no further hope of its restoration, he obtained dispensation from his religious vows in order to accept a canonry at Vienna. On April 24, 1824, he became Prince-Bishop of Seckau and administrator of the diocese of Leoben. These two dioceses, with a population of 800,000, had been without a bishop for twelve years, during which time the government had free scope to infuse Josephinistic ideas into the clergy and laity. The monasteries, almost without exception, had relaxed in discipline; the clergy, both secular and regular, were for the most part worldly-minded and exceedingly lax as pastors of the faithful. Despite governmental opposition, Zängerle inaugurated a thorough religious renovation in both dioceses, reformed the existing monasteries, introduced the Redemptorists, Jesuits, Carmelites and Vincentian Sisters, founded the School Sisters of the Third Order (1843), erected a boys' seminary for both dioceses at Leoben, thoroughly renovated the diocesan seminary religiously and educationally, introduced annual retreats for the clergy, and in many other ways provided for the welfare of both dioceses.

His father, Eleazar Löw, instructed him in Talmudic literature, and at an early age he became rabbi of a Polish congregation. One of his students was Abraham Judah ha-Kohen Schwartz. In 1812, following his father to Austria, he became rabbi of Kolín, Bohemia. In 1826 he was called as rabbi to Nagytapolcsány (Topoľčany), Royal Hungary, and in 1836 to Verbo (Vrbové), where he spent the remainder of his life. Löw's only work was Sha'are Torah, a treatise on the principles of Talmudic law which shows the author's methodical mind and vast knowledge of Talmudic literature. Three parts of the work appeared in print (Vienna, 1821 and 1850; Sátoraljaújhely, 1872), while the 4th part was still in manuscript as of 1906. Löw was twice married; his first wife, from whom he obtained a divorce, was the daughter of Ephraim Zalman Margolioth of Brody; the second was the daughter of Isaac Landau, rabbi of Auschwitz (Oświęcim). Löw's son Jeremiah, rabbi in Sátoraljaújhely, was the recognized leader of the Orthodox party in Hungary and its spokesman in an audience which its deputation obtained with the Emperor in order to protest against the establishment of a rabbinical seminary. He was nevertheless opposed to the secession of the Orthodox from the whole body of Judaism and therefore refused to take part in a congress planned by the Orthodox. Upon his death in 1872 he was succeeded by his son Eleazar, who was later called to the rabbinate of Unghvar (Uzhhorod). Other grandsons of Wolf Löw were Abraham and Benjamin Singer, joint authors of Ha- Madrik, a pedagogic anthology of the Talmud. Moses Löb Bloch was Wolf Löw's nephew and pupil.

Gans figured in the English state papers of the reign of Elizabeth I and a full description of his operations is preserved in these documents, printed by Donald. Gans's most dramatic scientific discovery was to reduce the time to purify a batch of copper ore from sixteen weeks to just four days. Additionally, Gans was able to use the impurities removed from the copper ore in textile mordants. =Colonization of America= Gans became the first Bohemian and the first recorded Jew in colonial America when, in 1585, Sir Walter Raleigh recruited him for an expedition to found a permanent settlement in the Virginia territory of the New World. Sir Ralph Lane, Governor of Raleigh's expedition, led the Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island off the coast of modern North Carolina in 1585. Among the ruins at the Roanoke site, archaeologists have discovered lumps of smelted copper and a goldsmith’s crucible attributed to Gans's work at the colony. Because the royal mining company failed to resupply colonists who were also becoming increasingly fearful of conflicts with the Native Americans, they accepted an offer from Sir Francis Drake in June 1586 to sail them to England. Each of the colonists, including Gans, left North America. =Later life and trial for blasphemy= Gans moved to the town of Bristol where he gave Hebrew lessons to English gentlemen who wanted to read the Bible in its original tongue. In 1589, Bishop of Chichester Richard Curteys visited Gans who in speaking \\"in the Hebrue tonge,\\" proclaimed himself a Jew. Bishop Curteys asked Gans, \\"Do you deny Jesus Christ to be the Son of God?\\" Gans replied, \\"What needeth the almighty God to have a son? Is he not almighty?\\" Gans was brought before the mayor and aldermen of Bristol for blasphemy. Rather than embarrass an associate of the Royal Mining Company, Bristol’s town fathers referred his case to the Queen’s Privy Council, which included major investors of the Royal Mining Company. Gans was transported back to London to face their judgment. Francis Walsingham, who was then joint principal secretary and other members of the council also knew him. The council appears to have taken no hostile action, however, although the trial's outcome and all subsequent history of Gans is unknown, as no information is available. =Posterity= His discoveries along with the general body of his scientific work led to a degree of fame. Some historians have suggested that Gans was the model for the Jewish scientist Joabin in Sir Francis Bacon's utopian novel, New Atlantis, although others have suggested Joabin is named after Joab, the commander of King David's army and David's co-conspirator in Uriah the Hittite's death.

Throughout her career as a state librarian, journal editor, public speaker, and organizer, Ahern crusaded for the value of public libraries in educating the public. Ahern was inducted in the Library Hall of Fame in 1951, and named in American Libraries in 1999 as one of the \\"100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century.\\" Early life Mary Eileen Ahern was born October 1, 1860, in rural Marion County, Indiana, to Mary (O'Neal) and William Ahern. Both of her parents were Irish immigrants. Mary Eileen, the second of three children, moved with her family to Spencer, Indiana, at the age of ten. She graduated from Spencer High School in 1878 and enrolled at Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana, where she graduated in 1881. CareerState librarian= After graduating from college, Ahern worked as an Indiana public school teacher until 1889, when she was appointed as the Indiana assistant state librarian. Ahern's early work at the state library included cataloging its collections. In 1893 the state legislature appointed Ahern as the Indiana state librarian, a political position that she retained until 1895. Ahern was outspoken in her fight for change at the state library, which included convincing the state's politicians to depoliticize the library's leadership appointments and to place the library under the Indiana Department of Education. Ahern's efforts were successful, not for herself but for future librarians. As a condition of the political compromise that was reached, she agreed not to seek reappointment as state librarian. Ahern stepped down as Indiana's state librarian and left state government in 1895, but continued to remain active in state, national, and international efforts to improve public libraries. She also encouraged the development of the modern library movement. After Ahern's political appointment ended, she left Indiana to pursue a formal library education at the Library School of the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois, for a year. =Journal editor= After completing her library studies in Chicago, Ahern accepted a position as the founding editor of a new journal, Public Libraries (later shortened to Libraries). She edited the journal from her base in Chicago for the next thirty-six years. Deteriorating eyesight forced her to gave up her editorship in 1931. Following her retirement,the publishers decided the journal could not continue without her editorial leadership. Its final issue was a tribute to her many years of service. Ahern clearly stated her views on the value of public education, beginning in the first volume, second issue, of Public Libraries: \\"There is only one solution of all social problems, an increase in intelligence, a gradual education of the people.\\" She further argued that a public library could provide the best source of this education because it \\"is the broadest of teachers, one may almost say the only free teacher. It is the most liberal of schools; it is the only real people's college.\\" The journal's tag lines also publicized and promoted the valued public libraries: \\"The Public Library is an Integral Part of Public Education\\" and \\"The best reading for the greatest number, at the least cost.\\"Cover and Ahern became an influential authority on public policy issues related to libraries through her writing and public appearances across the county. She described her vision for public libraries, as well as providing practical professional development resources for libraries, and influenced librarians and library practice throughout the United States. =Other contributions= Ahern was an organizer and avid participant in several library organizations in addition to her journalistic work. While serving as the Indiana assistant state librarian Ahern established the Indiana Library Association, serving as its secretary from 1889 to 1896 and as its president in 1895. Ahern served three times as president of the Illinois Library Association. She was also a lifelong member of the American Library Association, active on numerous ALA committees, and a member of its board. At the thirteenth annual meeting of the Illinois Library Association, when Ahern was serving as the organization's president, she delivered the annual address with these words of encouragement: \\"We are librarians because we feel that in these lines there are greater opportunities for helpfulness, greater vistas of optimistic outlook, greater results in actual returns of the worthwhile, than in any other line of work which we might have chosen.\\" Ahern also served in the federal government and as secretary of the Library Department of the National Education Association. During World War I she served as publicity agent and distributed books for the U.S. military in France from January to July 1919. Ahern continued to learn and advocate for changes in library policy. In 1927 she returned to Europe to study the library systems in France and England. Death and legacy Ahern died on a train near Atlanta, Georgia, as she was traveling home to Chicago on May 22, 1938. Ahern is best known for her widespread influence in establishing and strengthening connections between libraries and schools in the United States. She was also an advocate for women in the profession and saw the potential of libraries to provide lifelong educational opportunities to the public. As essayist W. C. Berwick Sayers described her: \\"How intensely alive Miss Ahern seemed, how full of ideas, ideals, enthusiasms, how enquiringly humorous!\\"\\"Abstract\\" for Honors and tributes * Inducted into the Library Hall of Fame in 1951. * Named in American Libraries in 1999 as one of the \\"100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century.\\" NotesExternal links * * \\"Mary E.

Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116–124, 141–143 During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. The Videha Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila. Earlier, the Saharsa district was part of the Munger and Bhagalpur districts. On 1 April 1954 it was made a district of its own. It was also made headquarters of Kosi division on 2 October 1972, comprising Saharsa, Purnia and Katihar district, with its headquarters at Saharsa. Similarly a new Civil Sub-Division Birpur was created on 1 December 1972, consisting of 24 development blocks, including Raghopur, Chhatapur, Basantpur and Nirmali, which were previously under Supaul subdivision of the district. Two new districts, Madhepura and Supaul, were formed from Saharsa district on 30 April 1981 and 1991. Saharsa district now consists of two subdivisions, Saharsa Sadar and Simri Bakhtiarpur. The district consists of 10 development blocks and anchals each. From the archaeological evidences, it is proved that it was the major city during Guptas Period.

It was reduced to nil strength and placed on the Supplementary Order of Battle (i.e., virtually disbanded) in 1968. They participated in the 1942 Dieppe Raid, during which they undertook a supplementary, secret mission to guard, and if necessary, kill, a radar technician trying to discover vital information on the German radar station outside Dieppe.  History  The regiment traces its lineage to July 3, 1905, when an infantry regiment was authorized in the District of Assiniboia and the District of Saskatchewan, which later that year became the province of Saskatchewan. The regiment was eventually organized as the 95th Saskatchewan Rifles, in Regina. After the First World War the 95th merged with the 60th Rifles of Canada (in Moose Jaw) to become the South Saskatchewan Regiment, which expanded to five battalions with the creation of units in Weyburn (3rd Battalion), Moosomin (4th Battalion) and Estevan (5th Battalion). In 1924, each of the battalions became a distinct regiment, and the name \\"South Saskatchewan Regiment\\" went out of use. In the 1936 reorganization of the Militia, the Weyburn Regiment and the Saskatchewan Border Regiment (in Estevan) re-amalgamated into a new South Saskatchewan Regiment. During the Second World War, The South Saskatchewan Regiment participated in many major Canadian battles and operations, as part of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The South Saskatchewan Regiment fought in the Dieppe Raid of 1942, Operation Atlantic, Operation Spring, Operation Totalize, Operation Tractable, and the recapture of Dieppe in 1944. They, along with the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment liberated the Westerbork transit camp on 12 April 1945. During the Dieppe Raid they also undertook one of the more unusual missions of the war. They provided a bodyguard for an RAF radar expert, Jack Nissenthall, who had volunteered to try penetrate a German radar station on a cliff above “Green Beach”. Because Nissenthall knew the secrets of British and US radar technology, he was awarded a personal bodyguard of South Saskatchewan sharpshooters. Their orders were to protect him, but in the event of possible capture to kill him. He survived and his action enabled vital information on the state of development of the German radar to be discovered. The full story, along with graphic, first-hand descriptions of the South Saskatchewan Regiment's actions during the raid are told in James Leasor's book, \\"Green Beach\\". After the regiment was placed on the Supplementary Order of Battle in 1968, the queen's and regimental colours were deposited at Estevan Comprehensive School in 1969.

Holey dollar is the name given to coins used in the early history of two British settlements: Prince Edward Island (now part of Canada) and New South Wales (now part of Australia). The middle was punched out of Spanish dollars, creating two parts: a small coin, known as a \\"dump\\" in Australia, and a \\"holey dollar\\". This coin was one of the first coins struck in Australia. Spanish dollar From 1497, the Spanish government started to mint a large silver coin that, through wide circulation, became known as the Spanish dollar. It was also known as the peso of eight reales, or Piece of eight royals. Prince Edward Island (Canada)  Around the end of the 18th century, the Spanish dollar was in constant circulation in Eastern Canada and the United States. The value of the coin varied in different centres but was highest in Halifax. Therefore, whenever the merchants of Prince Edward Island (PEI) secured them, they sent them to Halifax to take advantage of the higher rate. The resulting shortage of money in PEI prompted the governor in 1813 to gather in all the Spanish dollars he could and have their centres punched out. Both the central plug and rims were stamped with a sunburst. The punched centres passed as shillings and the outer rims as five-shilling pieces. The combined value of the mutilated coins was thereafter 20 percent greater in PEI than outside the island (and the individual components less valuable), so as a consequence, the coins became the official currency in PEI. British colony of New South Wales (Australia)  When the colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788, it ran into the problem of a lack of coinage. Foreign coins – including British, Dutch, Indian and Portuguese – were common in its early years, but much of this coin left the colony by way of trade with visiting merchant ships.National Museum of Australia collection highlights: Holey dollar Barter was a necessity amongst the colonists, with the most popular, rum, becoming an unofficial currency. One of the first attempts to restrict the practice was by Governor King, who on 19 November 1800 set an arbitrary price for foreign coinage, but there was never enough of it. To try and resolve the shortage, he requested the supply of sixpences to be used as shillings, but failed to get a hearing. The practice of using rum as a currency was prohibited by Governor Bligh in 1806, eventually culminating in the overthrow of the government in the Rum Rebellion. To overcome this shortage of coins, Governor Lachlan Macquarie took the initiative of using £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government to produce suitable coins in a similar manner to that described above. These coins to the value of 40,000 Spanish dollars came on 26 November 1812 on HMS Samarang from Madras, Described as \\"... with treasure for the use of government.\\" via the East India Company.Ian W. Pitt, ed (2000). Renniks Australian Coin and Banknote Values (19th ed. ed.). Chippendale, NSW: Renniks Publications. With the shipment of currency were strict instructions to prevent the newly arrived coinage from leaving the country, so after consultation with the Judge Advocate and other officials, Governor Macquarie had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them, thus making them useless outside the colony. The central plug (known as a dump) was valued at 15 pence (i.e., 1 shilling, 3 pence, or 1s 3d), and was restruck with a new design (a crown on the obverse, the denomination on the reverse), whilst the holey dollar received an overstamp around the hole (\\"New South Wales 1813\\" on the obverse, \\"Five Shillings\\" on the reverse). This distinguished the coins as belonging to the colony of New South Wales, creating the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in NSW. The combined nominal value in NSW of the holey dollar and the dump was 6s 3d (6 shillings, 3 pence), or 25 percent more than the value of a Spanish dollar; this made it unprofitable to export the coins from the colony. The project to convert the 40,000 Spanish coins took over a year to complete. Of the 40,000 Spanish dollars imported, 39,910 holey dollars and 39,910 dumps were made, with the balance assumed to have been spoiled during the conversion process. On 1 July 1813 Governor Macquarie issued a proclamation \\"that the said Silver Money shall be a legal Tender\\" and that set their value. The converted coins went into circulation in 1814. From 1822 the government began to recall the coins and replace them with sterling coinage. By the time the holey dollar was finally demonetised in 1829, most of the 40,000 coins in circulation had been exchanged for legal tender and melted down into bullion. Experts estimate that only 350 Holey dollars and 1500 dumps remain.Mira and Noble (1989), as cited in Pitt (2000), p. 9 The rarity of the Australian holey dollar ensures that even those in relatively poor condition are valuable. There are many stories of holey dollars being found in unusual circumstances. The holey dollar is the logo for the Macquarie Group, an Australian investment bank. Similar coins Although not known as \\"holey dollars\\", several British colonies in the Caribbean used the same method for producing coins from Spanish dollars. They include British Guiana, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent, Tobago and Trinidad. The holed coins and plugs circulated alongside various other coins made by cutting Spanish and Spanish colonial coins into sections. These coinages were denominated in either shillings and pence or bits, worth nine pence. (One dollar was made up of eight bits. At 9d the bit, this meant that the eight bits were worth 6s in their markets, or 20 percent more than a Spanish dollar.) Principality of Hutt River The Principality of Hutt River issued a commemorative $1 coin in 1977 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. In 1978, another issue of the Hutt River Province Principality's $1 coins was issued. This has no commemorative inscription. These coins are also known to numismatists as holey dollars as well.

Created by Scott Lobdell, he first appeared in X-Men #36 (Sept 1994). Publication historyFictional character biography X-Men #36. Art by Andy Kubert.Everett Thomas was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He is first introduced in X-Men #36 when the mechanical collective race known as the Phalanx had assimilated the X-Men and attempted to wipe out what was to be the next generation of mutant heroes: Husk, Jubilee, Monet, Skin, and Blink, all of whom, with the exception of Blink, would eventually become members of Generation X.Generation X #1 Synch synced with Banshee, who was in the area, in order to defend himself from the Phalanx. However, as a side effect, he shattered all the windows nearby, which drew the attention of the local police. Even as they surrounded him, a few officers had already been infected by the Phalanx and again tried to capture Everett. He was saved by Banshee and Sabretooth, and then quickly helped them prevent yet another Phalanx attack on the White Queen and Jubilee, who had helped locate Everett. The White Queen linked her mind with Everett's and Jubilee's, which allowed Everett to synch with Jubilee and use her powers to a degree she had been afraid to, defeating the Phalanx for the moment.X-Men #36 This misfit band of heroes ended up saving the other kids who were captured by the Phalanx, and with the sacrifice of Blink, they escaped the menace.Uncanny X-Men #317, X-Men #37 Following this, the kids were all relocated to the Massachusetts Academy where they would train to use their powers, receive a formal education, and act as Generation X, the next generation of X-Men, on the side. They were soon joined by new recruits Chamber, who had been invited by Charles Xavier, and Penance, a former prisoner of the mutant Emplate who had been liberated by Gateway.Generation X #1 Synch played a major role in many of Generation X's adventures, and was known for being both even-tempered and very resourceful in the growing use of his (and by extension, his teammates') powers. During one of Emplate's attacks, Synch fell under his thrall and became one of his vampire-like minions. This rendered most battle strategies against Synch useless, as he could use his teammates' powers against them without restraint, forcing them to employ more unconventional means.Generation X #14–16 Synch was also unknowingly a source of romantic tension among his female teammates. His close friendship with Jubilee eventually resulted in her having strong feelings for him. Synch never seemed aware of this and apparently did not feel the same way, due largely to a crush on Monet.Generation X #54 For a time Synch was fixated on Gaia, who did initially seem just as interested in him.Generation X #39, 44–45 Shortly before a battle where the team could have died, Synch admitted to Monet he regretted never having a first kiss. Monet (who was being impersonated by her sisters Nicole and Claudette, unknown to Synch at the time) agreed to share one with him, which clearly left quite an impression on him,Generation X #30 even once Nicole admitted the deception and the true Monet returned.Generation X #40 Synch later began dating the true Monet after she admitted her feelings for him, but their relationship would be cut short by tragedy.Generation X #67–70 When Emma Frost's sister Adrienne Frost comes to America, she forces Emma to re-admit her back into the school. If not, Adrienne would release information to the parents of the normal students that the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters was a secret training ground for mutants. Later, Adrienne created mutant hatred amongst the human students in the school. When the parents of the non-mutant students heard that their children were going to school with mutants, they all rushed to take their children away from the academy, causing a riot. However, Adrienne had planted bombs all around the school. Banshee and Synch set out to deactivate all the bombs, while Emma and Adrienne brutally fought. Eventually, Emma pulled out a gun and shot Adrienne. Meanwhile, Banshee and Synch separated. Synch found a bomb and there were human students nearby. He synced with the nearest mutant, Monet. However, she was too far away, so he only received a portion of her powers, which was her super strength. Using all his might, he threw the human kids out of the room, saving them from the explosion. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to save himself, dying to save his human peers.Generation X #70 Synch is later resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene's army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.X-Force vol. 3 #22 (Feb. 2010) Everett's fate is uncertain as it is unknown whether he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to the newly-godlike Selene or whether he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia. Synch was among the many mutants gathered on the island of Krakoa, after it was established as the new sovereign nation for mutantkind, implying he was cured of the Transmode Virus.House of X #6 Powers and abilities Synch's mutant power equips him with a bio-energetic aura that allows him to temporarily duplicate the effect of the powers of any superpowered being in his vicinity and sometimes the power itself, essentially becoming \\"in synch\\" with that person (or more specifically, his or her bio-energetic aura). His power can be explained as a subconscious matter manipulation that mimics superpowers. When Synch uses his powers, a multi-colored aura appears around his body. The aura is caused by the energies he is absorbing splitting the ambient light around him. Synch seemingly had greater mastery of his mutant abilities than his peers, often displaying more control over whatever powers he copied than that person. For example, he was also able to utilize Chamber's powers to fly, something Chamber was never able to do. It had been theorized that in time, Synch would have been able to permanently retain any powers he acquired. However he is not always able to synch with purely physical abilities or abilities that exceed his physical makeup. In House of M, he was able to retain powers permanently as a junior member of S.H.I.E.L.D. If Synch had not died he would potentially have become one of the most powerful mutants in the Marvel Universe. Other versionsAge of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse, Synch was one of the many mutants killed in the war with Apocalypse.

Started on 3 April 1917 during the British Raj to house the historical artefacts found in the vicinity of Patna, it is in the style of Mughal and Rajput architecture and is known locally as the Jadu Ghar. Most of the early collections have now been transferred to Bihar Museum. History The Museum was constructed by the British to conserve and display the historical artifacts found in the vicinity of the state capital. The concept of having a museum arose in 1912, after Bihar and Bengal were separated. Patna Museum started functioning in 1915 from the commissioner's bungalow, on the campus of A. N. Sinha Institute. The artifacts were then shifted to new rooms at the Patna High Court building before being taken to the present building in 1929. The land that was selected for the museum, in 1925, was on Patna-Gaya road (now Budh Marg). The two- storeyed building, designed by Rai Bahadur Bishnu Swarup, was completed in 1928. It was opened as the first museum of Bihar and Orissa Province by then Governor of Bihar and Orissa, Sir Hugh Lansdown Stephenson. Collections Items on display in the multipurpose museum include archaeological objects, coins, art objects, paintings, instruments, textiles, paintings, thankas, bronze images and sculptures and terra cotta images by Hindu and Buddhist artists. It has a rare collection of British-period paintings depicting day- to-day life, as well as a fine collection related to the first President of India, Rajendra Prasad. It also houses a World War I cannon. The fossil of a tree said to be more than 200 million years old is on display, as is a casket — unearthed in 1958 by archaeologist, A. S. Altekar, at the Relic Stupa of Vaishali — said to contain the sacred ashes (relics) of Gautama Buddha.Pranava K. Chaudhary, \\"Holy ashes fail to attract pilgrims\\" in Times of India, 1 March 2003. A Didarganj Yakshi statue, discovered on a Ganges riverbank in 1917, was the museum's most prized collection, which was later shifted to Bihar Museum. The artefacts from ancient India era to 1764 are kept in Bihar Museum and those of post-1764 period are kept at Patna Museum. Rahul sankrityayan donated 10000 manuscript which are written in Gold and silver on handmade papers and book on Buddhist philosophy that were once in the library of ancient Nalanda and Vikramshila university.These manuscript were taken to Tibet dating back of around 700 years ago before the destruction of these universities.These manuscripts were brought by him. Beginning November 2009, a project was started to build a replacement museum in Patna to enable the display of larger collections.

It lies on the Oyapock River (which forms the border with Brazil), opposite the Brazilian town of Oiapoque. The town contains a town hall, a French Foreign Legion detachment, and some hotels (the main ones being Le Tamarin, Coz Calè and the Chez Modestine). History The town was founded on 23 April 1853 as a penal colony and named after a Dutch coin of Saint George which was discovered at the site. The camp was closed down in 1863. The discovery of gold in 1885 in the Camopi River revived the hamlet and the town was officially created in 1947. Transport An asphalted road from Saint- Georges to Régina was opened in 2004, completing the National Road 2 (RN2) from Cayenne (the préfecture and largest city of French Guiana) to the Brazilian border and ending the isolation of Saint-Georges. It is now possible to drive on a fully paved road from Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni on the Surinamese border to Saint-Georges on the Brazilian border. Following an international treaty between France and Brazil signed in 15 July 2005, the Oyapock River Bridge was built and was opened in March 2017. This bridge is the first land crossing ever opened between France and Brazil, and indeed between French Guiana and the rest of the world (there exists no other bridge crossing the Oyapock River, and no bridge crossing the Maroni River marking the border with Suriname). When the bridge was opened, it is possible to drive uninterrupted from Cayenne to Macapá (on the Amazon River), the capital of the state of Amapá in Brazil. Saint-Georges is served by the Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock Airport.

Background Jensen, who was of Danish descent, was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and received a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Denver. then moved into broadcasting—first at WLIP-AM in Kenosha, then at WMBD-TV in Peoria, Illinois; and WBZ-AM-FM-TV in Boston.Jim Jensen, Authority Figure (The Times Magazine) Career In November 1963, he was the \\"pool\\" reporter in Hyannis Port at the Kennedy compound in the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination. His reporting was noticed by WCBS, who hired him in 1964. He soon became weekend anchorman and backup weekday anchor behind Robert Trout, who was doing double duty at the station and at CBS News. Jensen didn't take too long to make an impact, winning notice for his coverage of Robert F. Kennedy's Senate campaign soon after he arrived in New York. When Trout left for a network assignment in Europe, Jensen succeeded him as WCBS' main anchor. He was the face of the WCBS newsroom for the next three decades. Jensen was known in New York for his booming, gravelly voice and deliberate demeanor, and was often thought of as a local version of Walter Cronkite. WCBS had gone back and forth with WNBC-TV for first place, but under Jensen became the dominant station in New York, a lead it kept for most of the time until the mid-1980s. He was also known for asking perceptive questions, even of his colleagues at the news desk. WCBS' reporters had to know their stories very well if their stories aired when Jensen was behind the anchor desk. They risked embarrassing themselves on-air if Jensen asked them a question that they could not answer. Over the years, his partners at the anchor desk – some of them New York broadcast legends in their own right – included Ralph Penza, Rolland Smith, Carol Martin, Michele Marsh, Warner Wolf, and finally Dana Tyler. He was reportedly the model for Jim Dial, Murphy Brown's co-anchor.Obituary (Associated Press) In 1988, Jensen's on-air demeanor was brought into question over an incident involving fellow WCBS anchor Bree Walker. After Walker wrapped a report on early detection of birth defects in children, Jensen began asking Walker personal, probing questions about her own deformities, broaching the possibility that Walker's parents might have aborted her had they known about her condition in advance. Shortly after the incident, Jensen, who had a drug habit for many years, sought rehab for depression, alcohol, cocaine, and valium addiction. His depression was related to the loss of his son Randall, a Williams College and Fordham Law graduate, who died in a glider accident in Ellenville, New York, in 1979. He was back at WCBS within a short time and traveled to Israel to cover the Persian Gulf War in 1991.Fight against drug addiction (New York Times) In 1994, WCBS demoted Jensen to host of its Sunday morning public- affairs show. At that time, he had been WCBS' lead anchor for 29 years—longer than anyone in New York television history. The station's ratings had declined considerably, and management wanted new blood at the anchor desk. However, the decision and the manner in which the situation was handled caused a firestorm of criticism. The criticism increased when Jensen was forced to retire, in 1995, shortly after Westinghouse announced it was buying CBS. WCBS' ratings plummeted even further, and by the end of 1995 it had sunk into last place and remained there for more than a decade before recovering in the mid-2000s.Obituary (The New York Times) Death Jensen died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on October 16, 1999, of a heart attack at age 72. Jim Jensen's marriage to his first wife Gerda ended in divorce. He was survived by his second wife, Rachel Gordon Jensen, three daughters and a son.

Sheung Wan Complex, now called the Sheung Wan Municipal Services Building, the site of the former South Block, is located at 345 Queen's Road Central. It is surrounded by: Queen's Road Central (South), Morrison Street (East) and Bonham Strand (North). History Western Market came into business in September 1844. Western Market later consisted of two separate blocks: South Block (demolished) and North Block (the current \\"Western Market\\"). The South Block at Queen's Road Central was built in 1858. Vendors were evicted and moved to the Hollywood Road Temporary Market in August 1980. The Victorian period South Block was demolished thereafter and replaced by the Urban Council Sheung Wan Complex, opened in 1988. The Edwardian period North Block and the Hollywood Road Temporary Market were closed at this time and vendors were relocated to the new complex. The North Block, smaller and more compact in design, was preserved and renovated by Land Development Corporation. This building, of the Queen Anne Revival style of the Edwardian period, was built in 1906 as an extension of the then existing Western Market. It was the former site of Harbour Office that had been moved to a reclamation area in Central District for a larger space to cope with its increasing workload. The old building of the Harbour Office was pulled down to build the North Block of Western Market.Central and Western Heritage Trail: Western Market (North Block) It operated as a food market until 1988. The building was damaged during the construction of Sheung Wan Station, and remediation works were undertaken afterward. Half the site was rezoned to facilitate a proposed widening of Morrison Street, which would have necessitated the building's demolition. In 1990, it was declared a historical monument and the renovated market building re-opened as \\"the Western Market\\" in 1991. Further refurnishment work was conducted in 2003.

It is very remote, surrounded by dense rainforest and, because there are no roads to the town, can only be reached via the Saül Airport. The village is located in the centre of French Guiana where springs give rise to three major rivers: the Mana, the Inini, and the Approuague River. The principal activities in the town are gold mining and trekking through the many rainforest trails. There is a tourist camp (Larozaly) and hotel (Les Eaux Claires) in the town. History In 1910, Sahul from Saint Lucia arrived in the area and discovered gold. His discovery resulted in the establishment of the village of Saül whose population peaked at 800 people. Between 1930 and 1946, Saül was part of the Territory of Inini which did not provide education for its inhabitants. Saül was one of the first villages to receive a primary school. In 1952, a 150 kilometer track was constructed between Saül via Bélizon to the road leading to Cayenne by the Guinese Mining Bureau in order to develop the gold mine at Saül. The cost of the track was more expensive than the gold production which had started to decline, and was abandoned in 1960. St. Anthony of Padua Church In 1962, the St. Anthony of Padua Church was consecrated. The church was declared a monument in 1993. The village had less than 100 inhabitants in the early 21st century.  Economy  Saül is situated in the Amazonian Forest and is not connected to any road system. Saül's economy is based on eco and scientific tourism. Tourists can reach the town by plane thanks to Air Guyane Express. In July 2008, the REXMA corporation made an application for a gold mining permit. Due to environmental concerns, the French Government postponed the decision in October 2008. On 26 October 2012, Arnaud Montebourg, the French Industry Minister, approved the permit. The Mayor and the council were shocked by this decision as they are promoting and living off eco tourism. The inhabitants of Saül, the botanist Scott Mori, politicians such as Chantal Berthelot and José Gaillou, and many organizations like IUCN, Fédération Guyane Nature Environment and Rainforest Rescue protested against the decision to reward the permit.

His most well-known musical project is LCD Soundsystem, which first gained attention with its single \\"Losing My Edge\\" in 2002 before releasing its eponymous debut album in February 2005 to critical acclaim and top 20 success in the UK. LCD Soundsystem's second and third studio albums, Sound of Silver (2007) and This Is Happening (2010) respectively, were met with universal acclaim from several music review outlets. Both albums have also reached the top 50 in the Billboard 200. LCD Soundsystem was named one of Rolling Stone’s New Immortals—\\"currently active (or relatively recently defunct) artists who [they] think will stand the test of time.\\" In 2011, it was announced that LCD Soundsystem would disband with a final show on April 11, 2011 at Madison Square Garden. In the following years, Murphy continued to pursue other artistic projects: some music related, others not. In early 2016, the band announced a reunion as well as an appearance at the 2016 Coachella Festival, with their fourth album American Dream and respective tour following afterwards in 2017. In May 2018 LCD soundsystem were headliners at All Points East festival in Victoria Park London.

Accessed January 26, 2020. \\"Grammy- nominated James Murphy who records as 'LCD Soundsystem' is a classmate from the Class of 1988.\\" He has cited his influences as Liquid Liquid, The B-52's, Talking Heads, The Fall, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Velvet Underground, Yes, David Bowie, Daft Punk and Can. Murphy was a member of Falling Man from 1988 to 1989, Pony from 1992 to 1994, and Speedking from 1995 to 1997. He was also the sound engineer for Sub Pop band Six Finger Satellite. (Former Six Finger Satellite member John Maclean is now on Murphy's record label as The Juan MacLean.) Murphy attended New York University, where he was an English major but later dropped out. At age 22, Murphy was offered a job writing for the sitcom Seinfeld which was then little-known. He did not expect the show to be successful and chose to continue with music instead. = DFA Records = Starting in 1993, Murphy used the name Death from Above when DJing, a nickname that was given to his signature PA setup while he was the sound setup for Six Finger Satellite. Murphy engineered Northern Irish DJ David Holmes’ album Bow Down to the Exit Sign and was introduced to the record’s co-producer, Tim Goldsworthy (formerly of UNKLE). Goldsworthy and Murphy would DJ together on the Lower East Side, doing so with diverse genres of music. They went on to found DFA Records with Jonathan Galkin in 2001. The name \\"Death from Above\\" led to a dispute with a two-man Canadian band also using the same name. In response to a legal threat, the Canadian group changed their name to Death from Above 1979. LCD Soundsystem LCD Soundsystem = In 2001 Murphy started the electronic dance-punk band LCD Soundsystem. The band first came to attention with its first single \\"Losing My Edge\\". The band released its self- titled debut album in 2005 to critical acclaim. = Sound of Silver = Murphy at Route Du Rock in August 2007. Murphy's second LCD Soundsystem album, entitled Sound of Silver, was released on March 12, 2007.James Murphy talks exercise, new LP, future plans In its aftermath, he quipped to Mojo: \\"You don't have to work very hard to write an article about us. \\"Just use the words 'unlikely frontman', 'bear-like', 'unshaven', 'Talking Heads', blah blah blah...\\"Mojo, date unknown In October 2009 Pitchfork Media named the track \\"All My Friends\\" off Sound of Silver, the second best song of the decade, and a week later, Sound of Silver was ranked at #17 in The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list. He also has a CD in the Fabriclive CD series, Fabric Live 36, made in collaboration with LCD Soundsystem drummer Pat Mahoney, released in October 2007.FabricLive.36 James Murphy & Pat Mahoney In late 2008 Murphy also announced he is to play bass guitar in Free Energy, a classic rock band, with LCD Soundsystem drummer Pat Mahoney and friends Scott Wells and Paul Sprangers, although this was later refuted by Murphy as a misinterpretation. = This Is Happening and disbandment = Murphy at Berlin Festival 2010. In late 2009 Murphy moved into film scoring, writing music for Noah Baumbach's film Greenberg. The soundtrack was released on March 22, 2010. LCD Soundsystem's third album This Is Happening was released on May 17, 2010 in the UK and May 18 in the US. The album was recorded over the course of 2009 and early 2010 in the Mansion. April saw the release of the first single \\"Drunk Girls\\" with an accompanying music video directed by Spike Jonze. The album is dedicated to Jerry Fuchs (1974–2009), who had performed drums live with the band on occasion as well as having a big part with other associated DFA acts. Murphy announced his retirement from LCD Soundsystem with the release of This Is Happening, and made his last television appearance under that name on February 14, 2011, on The Colbert Report. His last concert at Madison Square Garden was simulcast streaming on Pitchfork Media's website on April 2, 2011. In July 2012, Shut Up and Play the Hits, a documentary film about James Murphy and LCD Soundsystem's final concert, received a limited theatrical release in the US and subsequently in UK cinemas and on Blu-ray and DVD. The film follows James Murphy over a 48-hour period, from the day of the band's final gig at Madison Square Garden to the morning after the show. The film also features intermittent segments from an extended interview between Murphy and pop culture writer Chuck Klosterman. =Reunion and American Dream (2015–present)= In October 2015, over 5 years after the band's third and previously final album, Consequence of Sound reported that \\"multiple sources\\" confirmed LCD Soundsystem's reunion in 2016 by headlining multiple \\"high- profile music festivals in the US and UK\\". The report was also confirmed by Billboard the same day, but quickly after these rumours, DFA Records label manager Kris Petersen denied the reunion of the band, with DFA co-founder Jonathan Galkin seconding the denial in a Pitchfork article. However, on December 24, 2015, the band contradicted these denials by releasing a new single, \\"Christmas Will Break Your Heart\\". After the new single, on January 4, 2016, LCD Soundsystem confirmed that they would be headlining the 2016 Coachella Festival. The day following on January 5, 2016, Murphy confirmed a new studio album in 2016 in addition to other unspecified appearances. On May 4, 2017, Murphy announced two new LCD Soundsystem singles entitled \\"Call the Police\\" and \\"American Dream\\" were to be released at midnight, coinciding with their performance on Saturday Night Live. He also said that the album was nearing completion. American Dream was released on September 1, 2017 through DFA Records and Columbia Records. Other projects James Murphy DJing at the 2013 CBGB Festival. After the disbandment of LCD Soundsystem (between 2011 and 2015), James Murphy pursued other artistic projects including remixing, directing, developing his own espresso, producing, and putting out footage and audio from LCD Soundsystem's final show. Murphy has stated that dissolving LCD Soundsystem has made it possible for him to experiment with other projects. \\"So [these projects] [become] possible, which is incredible. I get to do all this crazy shit – and if I ever wanted to be in a band again, I can probably figure that out.\\" He has also stated how much time the creation of an album takes and that time can be spent doing other activities. \\"I wouldn’t have a record coming out in April if I had done all [these projects]. It’s impossible. And if I had a record coming out in April, I would have been fucking invisible for two years.” Though Murphy has illustrated a great freedom with his spare time after the band, he also “miss[es] it a lot [at times]”. = Britney Spears = In 2003, Murphy worked with pop singer Britney Spears on her album In the Zone, but the collaboration was unsuccessful. According to Murphy, \\"She seemed eager to please, but it went nowhere. She went to dinner and just never came back.\\" = Reflektor = Murphy worked on Arcade Fire's fourth studio album Reflektor. A Win Butler interview conducted by Rolling Stone revealed that he thought of LCD Soundsystem \\"like New Order and the B-52's\\". He continued to state that Arcade Fire are influenced by bands that have also influenced LCD Soundsystem. A collaboration between Arcade Fire and James Murphy has been intended since Arcade Fire's sophomore album Neon Bible, however time conflicts prevented such a collaboration. Though Murphy has regularly stated in interviews that he \\"didn't do that much\\" to help Arcade Fire, he has said that he worked the most extensively on the song Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice). Butler predicts that the band and James Murphy will collaborate again in the future, as he feels \\"like [they] have more work to do\\". = Despacio = Together with David and Stephen Dewaele of 2ManyDjs and engineer John Klett, Murphy designed Despacio: a formation of eight McIntosh speakers stacked to eleven feet. The idea for the system came from Murphy and the Dewaele brother's dissatisfaction with the evolution of DJ culture and how DJing has become more of a “show-spectacle-type scenario” and has departed from the days of people dancing in the dark with little attention to the DJ. The design is “designed for really immersive listening”. The reason behind creating and performing with Despacio is to encourage DJs to implement a similar sound system, altering the course of DJ culture to its dance roots. = Subway Symphony = James Murphy has been attempting to change the sound of the New York turnstile beeps since 1999. Murphy has described the current turnstile sound as of 2014 as a “dissonant rubbing-Styrofoam-on-glass squeak” that is “horrible”. Because the Metropolitan Transit Authority plans to update the system by 2019, Murphy has proposed his turnstile plan that would have each turnstile harmonize with others by emitting three-to-five note sequences. Installing new sound chips will be an easier task during the renovations. Murphy feels that the more pleasant sounds will also help people's attitudes toward taking the subway. He believes that people will \\"feel a nostalgia\\" for certain destinations when hearing its unique melody. Murphy is prepared for the responsibilities if the idea is green-lit by the MTA and would be “broken hearted [if it doesn’t happen]”. In June 2015, he partnered with Heineken to launch the project, branded as the “Subway Symphony.” However, the MTA has denied any possibility of the project happening, as the standard turnstile beep is a necessary ADA-compliant tool for the visually impaired. = 2014 US Open Remixes = Collaborating with IBM, James Murphy “remixed” the 2014 US Open matches. Murphy composed an algorithm that generated pieces from the sounds and occurrences, such as fault, point and ace for example, of the actual matches. Murphy cut his favorite moments from the pieces and created 14 remixes from them. The remixes were created in real time during the matches on US Open's website. The pieces are titled by their match number and are viewable on the website with visual accompaniment denoting points scored. The website categorizes the pieces by men's’ matches, women's’ matches and Murphy's 14 remixes. = David Bowie = On November 5, 2013, Columbia Records released The Next Day Extra, a three-disc expanded edition of David Bowie's album The Next Day. On the expanded edition, Murphy remixed the track \\"Love Is Lost\\". The title of the remix is “Love is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Remix)\\". When Murphy was offered to remix the track, he had not remixed a song in five years, making it “really scary”. He said “it would have been scary if it was a remix for somebody I had never even heard of, but it was super scary to do that [Laughs]”. David Bowie is a significant influence on Murphy's music. Murphy was to be a producer for Bowie's final studio album, Blackstar, but it reportedly fell through. However, he does make a guest appearance on the album as a percussionist. = \\"Little Duck\\" = Murphy participated in Canon’s Project Imaginat10n, which called for 5 celebrities to direct short films based on pictures uploaded by people around the world to the Project Imaginat10n site. The result was “Little Duck”, Murphy's first directorial effort. Ron Howard advised Murphy in his directing. Shooting took place in Japan, the setting of the film. The film follows a young man who travels from Manhattan to Japan in order to help solve his brothers’ problems. = House of Good = In collaboration with coffee company Blue Bottle, Murphy created his signature coffee called House of Good. It is described as a “syrupy, well- balanced and thoroughly accessible\\" espresso. It was developed with help of Blue Bottle founder James Freeman. = Shut Up and Play the Hits and The Long Goodbye = LCD Soundsystem played their last show until 2016 on April 11, 2011 at Madison Square Garden. Both a documentary and a complete recording of the show were made. Shut Up and Play the Hits, directed by Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern, documents the highlights of the show and Murphy's actions after it. 11 cinematographers captured the entire near four-hour show from different angles in addition to three roof cameras. The documentary screened at select theaters around America for a limited time in 2012 and was later released in a DVD and Blu-ray form by Oscilloscope on October 9, 2012. The physical form consisted of three discs that contained the documentary and footage of the entire concert. The Long Goodbye is an audio capture of LCD Soundsystem's last show at Madison Square Garden. James Murphy mixed the audio, which was different from its video counterpart “because the film is mixed for your eye and the record is mixed for your ears.” Murphy has stated that the work into mixing the audio has been strenuous and “just murder”. The Long Goodbye was released as a vinyl box set on record store day, April 19, 2014. It was later released on vinyl and digitally. = Other projects = He recorded a song with Gorillaz and OutKast's Andre 3000, called \\"DoYaThing\\", for their Converse collection. It was released on February 23, 2012. He produced a song with Pulp called \\"After You\\". It was released as a present on Christmas Day 2012 to fans. Murphy also appeared in The Comedy with Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim. Murphy was listed as a producer for Yeah Yeah Yeahs' 2013 album, Mosquito. He also wrote the musical scores for the Noah Baumbach films Greenberg and While We're Young. = Four Horsemen = Murphy opened a wine bar named Four Horsemen in June 2015 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, selling a range of natural red, white and orange wines.

Railton (1895–1977) was a British automotive engineer, and designer of land and water speed record vehicles. Biography Reid Antony Railton was the son of a Manchester stockbroker: Charles Withingon Railton and his wife Charlotte Elizabeth (née Sharman), Reid was born in Chorley, Alderley Edge, Cheshire and was christened on 13 August 1895 at the local parish church. He was educated at Rugby School and Manchester University. He joined Leyland Motors in 1917 where he worked with J.G. Parry-Thomas on the Leyland Eight luxury car. He left in 1922 to set up the Arab Motor Company where he was chief designer. Only about twelve cars were built, of which two low-chassis cars survive. One is in the Isle of Man and the other one (chassis number 6, engine number 10, registration UW 2) is now in Austria having been rebuilt and rebodied by David Barker in the early 1990s. In 1927, on the death of his friend Parry-Thomas, Railton closed the Arab factory and moved to Brooklands working for Thomson & Taylor becoming their Technical Director with responsibility for John Cobb's 1933 Napier Railton car which took the Outer Circuit record in 1933 and Sir Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird Land Speed Record cars of 1931 to 1935. His greatest achievements were probably in designing the Railton Special carBirmingham Stories: \\"Britain makes the speed record its own\\" with which John Cobb set the Land Speed Record at in 1947 and designing the E.R.A. racing cars built in 1933–34 at Thompson & Taylors at Brooklands. He also tuned the Hudson chassis used on the Railton car, named after him. As well as cars he designed high-speed boats, including the jet-powered Crusader in which John Cobb was killed in 1952 while travelling in excess of attempting to break the Water Speed Record. In 1939 he moved to California to work for the Hall-Scott Motor Company. He died in Berkeley, California, in 1977 at the age of 82.

Legend The family legend first appeared in print in a 1934 article on Harbour Grace by William A. Munn.Hiscock 2002 p.198; It states that Sheila lived in the early 17th century and was from the recently dispossessed Gaelic nobility in Connacht. Catholic education being illegal in Ireland, she was sent to France to a convent school where her aunt was abbess. On the voyage there or back her ship was captured, first by a Dutch warship, and then by an English privateer captained by Peter Easton on its way to Newfoundland. En route Easton's lieutenant Gilbert Pike and Sheila fell in love; they landed at Harbour Grace, were married by the ship's chaplain, and settled first in Mosquito (now Bristol's Hope) and later in Carbonear. Munn's 1934 version states that Sheila and Gilbert's firstborn was \\"the first white child in Newfoundland\\", predating John Guy's 1610 colony at Cupids. Other versions reduce the scope to first white child in Carbonear or the west coast of Newfoundland, or extend it to all of Canada or British North America (where Virginia Dare was reputedly born in Roanoke Colony in 1587). In the 1940s, the story was broadcast several times by Joey Smallwood's radio show, The Barrelman, and included in a school reader, spreading it throughout Newfoundland.Hiscock 2002 p.221 In 1958, P. J. Wakeham self-published Princess Sheila, a novel based on the legend, which sold 5,000 copies by 1960 and was republished in 1987 as The Legend of Princess Sheila.Hiscock 2002 p.205 Many post-1960 versions of the legend incorporate elements of Wakehams' novel, such as Sheila's death aged 105.Hiscock 2002 p.210 The Pikes became a large family in Newfoundland, and many with a Pike in their family tree claim descent from Sheila.Hiscock 2002 p.200 Linda Duncan, MP for Edmonton—Strathcona, said in the House of Commons of Canada in 2009: : My family's roots, beginning around 1610 in Mosquito Point and Carbonear, were based on the shipping industry. My ancestor, Gilbert Pike, was a buccaneer. ... The most famous person in Newfoundland, Sheila NaGeira, is my ancestor. Name The given name Sheila is an anglicised spelling of the Irish name (old spelling ), itself originally a Gaelicisation of Celia or Cecilia which was later often equated with Julia. Sheila's second name is spelled Nagira in Munn's account.Hiscock 2002 p.212 A baby girl in Carbonear was given the middle name Mageila in 1917 in honour of Sheila.Hiscock 2002 p.213 All combinations of M or N with l or r are attested, while the middle vowel may be written i, e, a, ee, ei, or ie; together with the following r it may be pronounced , , , or (respectively like ERRor, squARE, nEAR, or stARt).Hiscock 2002 pp.212–214 Two-word forms like \\"NaGeira\\" and \\"na Geira\\" are found.Hiscock 2002 p.214 In aisling poems, was a common name for Ireland personified as a woman in bondage awaiting a Jacobite rising. Eponymous examples are one written by Munster poet Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin (1715–1795) and translated by James Clarence Mangan in 1849; another with the same metre translated by John D'Alton in 1831; and Ethna Carbery's Gaelic revival \\"Shiela ní Gara\\". Eugene O'Curry used the same personification in 1829 with reference to Catholic Emancipation. \\"Sheela na Guira\\", \\"Celia O'Gara\\", \\"Shillinaguira\\", and many other spellings, is a well- known Irish jig setting for the Ó Súilleabháin and D'Alton poems, attested from 1745.; Fleischman 2016 Nos. 1025, 1044, 1633, 1842, 2505, 2806, 3894, 3954, 4500, 5685, 6528 \\"Ni Ghadharadh\\" (modern spelling ) is the feminine form of Ó Gadhra (O'Gara), surname of the chiefs of Luighne Connacht. Another legendary \\"Sheela-na-Guira\\", or \\"Gillian Dwyer\\", was a tyrannical O'Dwyer () from Cullahill near Borrisoleigh in Munster. Na Guira has also been interpreted as Maguire (, an Ulster name).Fleischman 2016 No.1025 In Maria Edgeworth's 1817 play The Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock, the English Miss Gallagher scolds Irish maid Biddy for combing her hair too roughly: \\"You ran it fairly into my brain, you did! you're the grossest! heavy handiest!—fit only to wait on Sheelah na Ghirah, or the like.\\" Biddy is insulted, \\"though I don't rightly know who that Sheelah na Ghirah was, from Adam.\\" In 1978 Harold Horwood suggested that \\"Na-gaira\\" was not a surname but an Irish-language epithet meaning \\"the beautiful\\", and that Sheila's true surname was O'Conor, that of the Gaelic kings of Connacht.Hiscock 2002 pp.214–215; Hiscock suggests Horwood's \\"Na-gaira\\" is a misreading of \\"my darling\\".Hiscock 2002 p.243 n.52 A related elaboration of the legend is that Sheila's true name and lineage were kept secret in Newfoundland to avoid persecution.Hiscock 2002 pp.214–215 Historicity Scholars are sceptical of the story.Hiscock 2002 pp.201–202 Elements are common to folk traditions elsewhere in North America.Hiscock 2002 p.201 From the 1960s, older locals recounted to folklorists versions heard in their youth in the early twentieth century; there is no evidence of earlier currency.Hiscock 2002 pp.218, 223–224 An 1892 letter on \\"Sheela-na-Guira\\" in an Irish journal describes her as \\"daughter of the head of the Connaught O'Garas, and a celebrated beauty\\", without reference to Newfoundland or Pike. The first Pike recorded in Newfoundland is Thomas Pike at Carbonear in 1681. Ron Howell, chairman of the Carbonear Heritage Society, has written, \\"This lore of Sheila and Gilbert has no basis in recorded fact. ... It would give me great pleasure to know that someone discovered a credible, recorded, 17th or 18th century reference to either Sheila or Gilbert. I would suggest that anyone promoting the Sheila story note that it is folklore and not recorded history.\\" The putative grave of Sheila and Gilbert is on a site owned by the Pike family and descendants until acquired in the 1980s by the Royal Canadian Legion.Hiscock 2002 p.207 In 1982 the Canadian Conservation Institute gave the faded inscription on the extant gravestone as follows:Hiscock 2002 p.211 :Here lieth the body of John Pike, Sen. who departed this life 14 July 1753, aged 63. Also Julian his wife, died 14 June 174[?] Aged 69. Commentaries Philip Hiscock suggests that Smallwood valued the story as a foundation myth and its Catholic–Protestant marriage as \\"a metaphor for an unriven Newfoundland\\". Johanne Trew comments, \\"The gendering of the narrative is obvious: since the female Irish line is subsumed into the male English line, it is the English name/identity which remains visible.\\" Culture Princess Sheila appears, crowned, on the coat of arms of the town of Carbonear.Hiscock 2002 p.199 The local theatre is the \\"Princess Sheila NaGeira Theatre\\". A tourist information notice is at the site her putative grave.Hiscock 2002 p.217 Besides Wakeham's novel, works based on the story include the 1955 poem \\"The Ballad of Sheila Na Geira\\" by L. E.

He was awarded the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions while holding the town of Bouresches, France against an enemy force of superior numbers on the night of June 7–8, 1918. The United States Navy's is named in his honor. Military careerEarly years= Randolph Zane was born on August 12, 1887 in Philadelphia. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on January 6, 1909 and, a month later, reported for duty to the Headquarters, United States Marine Corps in Washington, D.C. After instruction at the Marine Officers' School, Port Royal, South Carolina, Zane joined the Marine detachment on the battleship at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on December 27, 1909.

Major Zane participated in the fighting in the vicinity of Belleau Wood, when the untried Marines came up against the 461st Imperial German Infantry, a unit that Colonel Robert D. Heinl called \\"the largest single body of combat-seasoned regular troops which Marines had confronted since Bladensburg\\" (1814). Zane took part in the second phase of the assault, when the 2nd Battalion 6th Marines and 3rd Battalion 6th Marines entered the wood, and remained in action through the entire period of fighting.

It was set up to promote and drive improvement in the quality of health care and public health in England and Wales. It aimed to achieve this by becoming an authoritative and trusted source of information and by ensuring that this information is used to drive improvement. The Commission was abolished on 31 March 2009 and its responsibilities in England broadly subsumed by the Care Quality Commission. History The legal name for the Healthcare Commission was the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). It was created by the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. The Healthcare Commission took over the role of the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) on the 1 April 2004 and also assumed some of the responsibilities of the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) and the Audit Commission, as well as a number of additional functions. The Commission's chairman was Professor Sir Ian Kennedy and its chief executive was Anna Walker. Peter Homa the Chief Executive of the Commission for Health Improvement was appointed as the first Chief Executive but resigned from the post at the request of the organisation's chairman Sir Ian Kennedy in April 2003. The Health and Social Care Act 2008 replaced the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Mental Health Act Commission with a single, integrated regulator for health and adult social care - the Care Quality Commission. The Care Quality Commission began operating on 1 April 2009 as a non-departmental public body. Functions The Healthcare Commission had a role in promoting quality in healthcare through providing an independent assessment of the standards of services provided by the National Health Service (NHS), private healthcare and voluntary organisations in England. The commission also had the responsibility of coordinating organisations that inspect, regulate or audit health bodies. In order to do this, it established the Concordat between bodies inspecting, regulating and auditing health or social care. The Healthcare Commission aimed to promote improvement in the quality of NHS and independent healthcare across England and Wales. The Commission's main statutory functions in England were: * Assessing the management, provision and quality of NHS healthcare and public health services * Reviewing the performance of all NHS trusts and award an annual performance rating to each trust * Regulating the independent healthcare sector through registration, inspection, monitoring complaints and enforcement activities * Publishing information about the state of healthcare in England * Investigating serious failures in healthcare services * Independently reviewing patients' complaints about NHS services that have not been resolved by the trusts involved * Promoting the coordination of reviews and assessments carried out by the Commission and other regulatory organisations The Healthcare Commission had a limited role in Wales, complemented by that of Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, which is part of the National Assembly for Wales. The ability to inspect all sectors, provide guidance and act if that guidance is not acted on was possible because the Healthcare Commission was independent of the government. Annual health check For the first two years of its existence, the Healthcare Commission continued the annual reporting of NHS providers using star ratings where NHS trusts were awarded one, two or three stars based upon their performance measured against clinical targets. From 2006, an \\"annual health check\\" replaced the star ratings assessment system and looked at a much broader range of issues than the targets used previously. It sought to make much better use of the data, judgements and expertise of others to focus on measuring what matters to people who use and provide healthcare services. Trusts had to declare their compliance with the core standards set out in Standards for Better Health, published by the Department of Health in 2004. The overall aim of the new assessment of performance, and the information gained through the process, was to promote improvements in healthcare. The annual health check process was designed to use views of patients and users of services as well as robust data sources for the arms-length monitoring of clinical performance. This lessening of the target setting by Whitehall was in line with the light-touch strategy set out by Gordon Brown in his 2005 budget and compatible with the vision proposed by David Cameron at the 2006 Conservative conference. It also aimed to help people to make better informed decisions about their care, promote the sharing of information and give clearer expectations on standards of performance. The new ratings effectively graded NHS organisations on the quality of services and use of resources with services deemed to be one of four levels: Weak - Fair - Good - Excellent. Trusts that met the clinical targets used in the previous star ratings achieved a rating of Fair. Good and Excellent ratings were awarded to organisations that could demonstrate that they had processes in place to improve their services.

These are, when sitting, given with the head fully thrown to the back, a peculiarity found among sea eagles only in this and the Madagascar species. or the African sea eagle, is a large species of eagle found throughout sub-Saharan Africa wherever large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply occur. It is the national bird of Namibia and Zambia. As a result of its large range, it is known in many languages. Examples of names include: nkwazi in Chewa, aigle pêcheur in French, hungwe in Shona, inkwazi in isiZulu, and 'ntšhu' (pronounced \\"ntjhu\\") in Northern Sotho. This species may resemble the bald eagle in appearance; though related, each species occurs on different continents, with the bald eagle being resident in North America. Taxonomy The African fish eagle is a species placed in the genus Haliaeetus (sea eagles). Its closest relative appears to be the critically endangered Madagascar fish eagle (H. vociferoides). Like all sea eagle species pairs, this one consists of a white-headed species (the African fish eagle) and a tan-headed one (Madagascar fish eagle). These are an ancient lineage of sea eagles, and as such, have dark talons, beaks, and eyes Both species have at least partially white tails even as juveniles. The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus, New Latin for \\"sea eagle\\" (from the Ancient Greek haliaetos), and vocifer is derived from its original genus name, so named by the French naturalist François Levaillant, who called it 'the vociferous one'.  Description  The African fish eagle is a large bird, and the female, at is larger than the male, at . This is typical sexual dimorphism in birds of prey. Males usually have wingspans around , while females have wingspans of . The body length is . The adult is very distinctive in appearance with a mostly brown body with a white head like the bald eagle and large, powerful, black wings. The head, breast, and tail of African fish eagles are snow white, with the exception of the featherless face, which is yellow. The eyes are dark brown in colour. The hook-shaped beak, ideal for a carnivorous lifestyle, is yellow with a black tip. The plumage of the juvenile is brown in colour, and the eyes are paler compared to the adult. The feet have rough soles and are equipped with powerful talons to enable the eagle to grasp slippery aquatic prey. While this species mainly subsists on fish, it is opportunistic and may take a wider variety of prey such as waterbirds. Its distinctive cry is, for many, evocative of the spirit or essence of Africa. The call, shriller when uttered by males, is a weee-ah, hyo-hyo or a heee-ah, heeah-heeah. Distribution and habitat This species is still quite common near freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, although they can sometimes be found near the coast at the mouths of rivers or lagoons. African fish eagles are indigenous to sub-Saharan Africa, ranging over most of continental Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Several examples of places where they may be resident include the Orange River in South Africa and Namibia, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and Lake Malawi bordering Malawi, Tanzania, and Mozambique. The African fish eagle is thought to occur in substantial numbers around the locations of Lake Victoria and other large lakes in central Africa, particularly the Rift Valley lakes. This is a generalist species, requiring only open water with sufficient prey and a good perch, as evidenced by the number of habitat types in which this species may be found, including grassland, swamps, marshes, tropical rainforest, fynbos, and even desert- bordering coastlines, such as that of Namibia. The African fish eagle is absent from arid areas with little surface water.  Reproduction  An adult on the nest in Lake Baringo, Kenya Egg African fish eagles breed during the dry season, when water levels are low. They are believed to mate for life. Pairs often maintain two or more nests, which they frequently reuse. Because nests are reused and built upon over the years, they can grow quite large, some reaching 2 m (6.0 ft) across and deep. The nests are placed in a large tree and are built mostly of sticks and other pieces of wood. A third-year juvenile at Grumeti River, Serengeti, Tanzania The female lays one to three eggs, which are primarily white with a few reddish speckles. Incubation is mostly done by the female, but the male incubates when the female leaves to hunt. Incubation lasts for 42 to 45 days before the chicks hatch. Siblicide does not normally occur in this taxon, and the parents often successfully rear two or three chicks. Chicks fledge around 70 to 75 days old. Postfledgling dependence lasts up to three months, whereafter the juveniles become nomadic, and may congregate in groups away from territorial adults. Those that survive their first year have a life expectancy of some 12 to 24 years.  Diet  African fish eagle carrying off a catfish in Lake Baringo, Kenya An African fish eagle feeding on its prey, likely a Mudfish Labeo sp., at the S3 Road West of Skukuza, Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga, South Africa The African fish eagle feeds mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon from a perch in a tree, snatching the prey from the water with its large, clawed talons. The eagle then flies back to its perch to eat its catch. Like other sea eagles, the African fish eagle has structures on its toes called spiricules that allow it to grasp fish and other slippery prey. The osprey, a winter visitor to Africa, also has this adaptation. Should the African fish eagle catch prey over ten times their own body weight, it is too heavy to allow the eagle to get lift, so it instead drags the fish across the surface of the water until it reaches the shore. If it catches a fish too heavy to allow the eagle to sustain flight, it will drop into the water and paddle to the nearest shore with its wings. The African fish eagle is known to steal the catch of other bird species (such as goliath herons) in a behaviour known as kleptoparasitism. It also feeds on birds, especially waterbirds such as ducks, greater and lesser flamingos, small turtles and terrapins, baby crocodiles, lizards, frogs, and carrion. Occasionally, it may even carry off mammalian prey, such as hyraxes and monkeys. It has also been observed feeding on domestic fowl (chickens).  Relationship with humans Conservation= This species is listed as least concern by the IUCN. The estimated population size is about 300,000 individuals with a distribution area of 18,300,000 km2. =Heraldry= In the form of the Zimbabwe Bird, it is the national bird of Zimbabwe and appears on the Zimbabwean flag. The bird also figures in the coat of arms of Namibia, Zambia, and South Sudan, and on the Zambian flag.

He attained a high position in academia without the benefit of a college education. In a career that began as a printer's aide for a newspaper, he worked as a stenographer and clerk, a newspaper reporter, a field agent for the U.S. Fish Commission (USFC) and its successor the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, as an editor for a commercial fishing trade magazine of the Pacific Northwest, and as a supervisor for companies in the commercial fishing industry. He took photographs during his extensive travels documenting scenes and people. In 1919, Cobb was appointed the founding director of the College of Fisheries at the University of Washington (UW), the first such college established in the United States. Early life and education John Nathan Cobb was born in Oxford, New Jersey, on February 20, 1868, the son of Samuel Spencer Cobb (1842‒1921), a railroad engineer, and Louise Catherine Richard (1845?‒1918), a native of Belfort, France. He was one of at least twelve children in the family. He attended public schools and discontinued his education at an early age to go to work. Early career Cobb with camera His family moved in the 1880s to Pennsylvania and records indicate that in 1884, at the age of 16 years, he was working for a Pennsylvania newspaper, the Carbondale Reader. He rose to become an editor of that periodical. For the next 15 years or so, Cobb worked, apparently as a stenographer and typist, in a variety of positions for a railroad company, a law firm, a supply and machinery enterprise, and a brick manufacturing company. In 1898, he married Harriet Collin Bidwell (1869‒1941), a cousin, with whom he had a daughter, Genevieve Catherine Cobb (1900‒1977) who graduated in zoology from the University of Washington and, after receiving a degree in librarianship at the UW, became a librarian at Princeton University and remained there until her retirement. In 1895, Cobb successfully passed a civil service examination for the U.S. Government, qualifying him for a position as stenographer and typist at a salary of $720 per year. He accepted a position in Washington, D.C., on 1 July 1895 with the U.S. Fish Commission, where he was appointed clerk in the Division of Statistics. He was promoted to \\"Field Agent\\" on February 11, 1896 at a salary of $1,000 per annum and was responsible for collecting commercial fishery statistics. Thus, Cobb began a career in fisheries that was to last until his death 35 years later and one that led to his recognition as an \\"expert\\" in fisheries statistics. Cobb with bicycle in Hatteras, North Carolina 1898 Cobb's position with the Fish Commission demanded considerable travel, as he was required to proceed throughout the eastern seaboard to collect statistics on the commercial catch of fish and shell fish. For example, from 1896 to 1897 Cobb visited Jacksonville, Florida; Havre de Grace, Maryland; Key West, Florida; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Key West again; and Cape Vincent, New York. After most of these trips he returned to the USFC headquarters in Washington, D.C. This pattern of frequent travel continued through 1900. Cobb's first publication for the Fish Commission, on the fisheries of Lake Ontario, was issued in 1898. =Alaska= Cobb among passengers on the steamship Dora in the summer of 1907 Cobb aboard a ship In 1904, Cobb began to lobby the Bureau of Fisheries for a position in Alaska as a Field Agent in that territory. Cobb obtained the desired position in February 1905 and his appointment as \\"Assistant Agent\\" paid $200 per month. Still based in Washington, D.C., Cobb traveled to Alaska each summer to observe the commercial salmon fisheries and to collect catch statistics. He was apparently a conscientious worker and was known for his aggressive enforcement of fishery regulations. Cobb's photo of gillnets on racks in Nushagak, Alaska Cobb wrote books and reports about fisheries. These included annual reports from 1905 to 1910 on the fisheries of Alaska and a book on Alaska salmon. He produced about 18 scientific publications and books during his tenure with the Fish Commission from 1895 to 1911. =Private sector= By early 1911, Cobb was eager for a transfer from Washington, D.C., to the west coast. In March of that year he wrote to George Mead Bowers (1863‒1925), Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, asking to be transferred to Seattle. His request was denied, so Cobb turned to the private sector for employment. On March 5, 1912, Cobb wrote again to Commissioner Bowers, this time tendering his resignation. Cobb thus left the employ of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to pursue greener paths. He never worked for the Bureau again, but he was always interested in returning if an attractive position became available. Into the commercial world Cobb's photograph of gillnetters at work in Washington In the spring of 1912, Cobb joined the Union Fish Company in San Francisco in a management position at a considerable increase in salary. The company fished for Pacific cod in Alaska, and Cobb traveled north on the company boats, the Union Jack in 1912 and the Sequoia in 1913, operating out of Sand Point and Unga, Alaska. Cobb's experience with the Union Fish Company was not satisfactory, as he apparently was not granted the freedom to manage as he had hoped, and he left the company on good terms in November 1913. Cobb sought to improve his position, as he continually did, and in November 1913 the commercial fishing trade magazine Pacific Fisherman, based in Seattle, hired him, although at a significantly lower salary than that paid by the Union Fish Company. In his letter of acceptance, Cobb agreed to move to Seattle about 15 November 1913 and to accept a salary of $40 a week \\"for the present.\\" His salary at the Union Fish Company was $200 a month. This monthly publication was the preeminent voice for the fishing industry of the west coast. He was hired as the editor of the journal and his particular experience in fisheries for the Bureau of Fisheries and the Union Fish Company brought rare skills to the magazine. The owner of the periodical, Leigh Miller Freeman (1875‒1955), became a power in the commercial fisheries industry and in fisheries conservation efforts. The Pacific Fisherman was a large format magazine devoted to all aspects of the fishing industry on the west coast. It paid particular attention to fishing developments in Alaska, and Cobb's experience in that territory was likely valuable to the magazine. Cobb remained with the magazine for four years. During this period, he established himself as an informed observer of the commercial fishing and fisheries scenes. As editor, Cobb most likely had wide latitude over what was published in the journal. He wrote articles that appeared in the journal under his byline, such as \\"Utilizing waste products in the salmon industry\\" and \\"New methods in Pacific coast fisheries.\\" Cobb also wrote for the scientific world, publishing in professional journals. An example of the latter includes \\"Pacific halibut fishery declining,\\" published in the Transactions of the American Fisheries Society. During his years with the periodical he published one book Pacific Cod Fisheries, a revised edition of which was issued in 1927, and in 1917 he published a revised version of his book, Pacific Salmon Fisheries. In Seattle in 1914, Cobb also helped found the Pacific Fisheries Society. Patterned after the American Fisheries Society, the new organization was directed toward the interests of fisheries workers, mainly scientific but also for members of the commercial industry of the U.S. west coast. Active membership in this new organization enabled Cobb to meet and to socialize with the leading men in both the scientific and commercial aspects of the Pacific coast fisheries. He longed, however, for a return to the Bureau of Fisheries. But a position with the latter agency was not forthcoming, so in 1917 he joined the Alaska Packers Association (APA) of San Francisco, California, at a salary nearly twice what he was receiving from the Pacific Fisherman. The Association was the largest and most influential commercial fishing enterprise in Alaska. At that time the APA operated the most fishing boats, employed the most workers, and canned the most salmon of any Alaska cannery. His move to the APA seemed part of his continuous desire to improve his status, economic and otherwise. During the salmon fishing season in Alaska in the summers of 1917 and 1918, Cobb traveled north to visit the various APA concerns. His work involved inspecting the working and sanitary conditions in the canneries. Because of his previous work in Alaska with the Bureau of Fisheries, Cobb was familiar with most of the APA packing operations there. He was apparently satisfied with his work with the APA, but he again sought another position of advancement. Cobb's experience in the fisheries of Alaska, his former position at the Pacific Fisherman, and his involvement with the Pacific Fisheries Society placed him at the forefront of a burgeoning movement to establish a \\"school of fisheries\\" at the University of Washington. He was not an unwitting observer of this movement. Indeed, he kept his name always fresh to the University administration and the result was that Cobb resigned from the APA in January 1919 to accept the founding directorship of the College of Fisheries at the University of Washington. This new position would serve him well and allow him to use his diverse talents in the fisheries field. College of Fisheries Cobb photo of the College of Fisheries building at UW, ca. 1921 The origin of the idea of a fisheries school at the University of Washington is unknown, but Miller Freeman, owner of Pacific Fisherman magazine and Cobb's one-time supervisor, likely played a vital role in the establishment of this new College. In his memoirs, Freeman wrote that he used the editorial pages of Pacific Fisherman to advocate the establishment of a school of fisheries at the University of Washington as early as 1914. Hugh McCormick Smith (1865‒1941), Commissioner, U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, was also an active supporter of the proposed school. At the University of Washington, planning for a school of fisheries continued at a more rapid pace. In October 1918, UW President Henry Suzzallo (1875‒1933) wrote Cobb that through Miller Freeman he had heard that Cobb \\"might like to participate in the organization of such a school as a member of this faculty.\\" Suzzallo was most concerned about the salary Cobb would require, noting that \\"Until this year our maximum salary has been $3,000.\\" Cobb responded to Suzzallo on December 26, 1918 with his application for the position of director, and he noted that he had merely a common school education. He listed some 35 publications on fisheries topics in his application. Suzzallo answered Cobb on January 4, 1919, appointing him Professor of Fisheries, administrative head of the Department of Fisheries, and Director of the College of Fisheries, at a salary of $4,000 per year. Cobb's initial appointment was for a four-year period. Two weeks later, on 17 January 1919, Suzzallo recommended to the Board of Regents that a College of Fisheries be established at the University of Washington. The Board agreed and the establishment of the College was authorized. This event was duly reported in the Pacific Fisherman. Cobb began the new College on a fast track. In an announcement for the College of Fisheries issued in early 1919, he wrote that so much interest was generated by the announcement of the establishment of the College that \\"Professor Cobb, the Director, is open [sic] it for the coming spring quarter, March 31st, instead of waiting until the beginning of the fall quarter as originally planned.\\" The announcement indicated the College would offer a four-year course of instruction in Fish Culture and Fisheries Technology, and briefly described the potential job market for graduates. The announcement further stated that the College would, so far as possible, \\"assist students in securing employment during summer vacations\\" in various aspects of the fishing industry, hatcheries, and elsewhere. The new college apparently began life housed in two temporary wooden buildings along the Lake Washington Ship Canal at the southern margin of the UW campus. The College soon relocated to other \\"temporary\\" housing located just north of the present UW Medical Center, where it remained until new quarters were built in the early 1950s. The initial faculty consisted of two new hires, one who taught courses in fish culture and another who was responsible for courses in fisheries technology. Trevor Charles Digby Kincaid (1872‒1970) of the Zoology Department taught ichthyology. Cobb taught at various times Introduction to Fisheries, Fisheries Methods, Fisheries Problems, and History of Fisheries. thumb Faculty of the UW College of Fisheries, 1929. Left to right: Norman Jarvis, Donald Crawford, John Cobb, Clarence Parks, and Leonard Schultz. University of Washington Archives, UW 15484. During Cobb's directorship, the faculty remained small and underwent considerable turnover, likely caused in part by the low salaries paid to instructors. The number of faculty listed in course catalogs from 1919 to 1930 ranged from two to five, including Cobb. Numerous \\"Associated Faculty\\" drawn from other UW departments or from industry or government agencies were listed in the Colleges entry in UW Course Catalogs. The design of the curriculum largely followed that suggested earlier to the UW President by Professor Kincaid and previously outlined by Cobb. Two curricular tracks were initially established, fish culture and fisheries technology. The two lines of inquiry were quite similar for the first two years, differing mainly in that the requirements for the technology major included twice as many chemistry credits as did the fish culture major. The number of fisheries courses offered increased from 12 in the initial year of the College to 24 in the academic year 1928 to 1929. Cobb in his office at UW Enrollment in the college was strong during the first decade of its existence, ranging from 30 to 117 students a year. The College initially offered Bachelor and Master of Science Degrees and, later, a Doctor of Philosophy Degree. The first graduating class in Fisheries was in 1922, with five B.S. degrees conferred as well as the first Ph.D. degree, awarded to Ray Clough, then on the College of Fisheries faculty. Identical numbers of degrees were apparently awarded each year in 1923, 1924, and 1925. The first M.S. degree was awarded in 1924 to Clarence Anderson, also on the faculty of the College. During Cobb's reign as Director and Dean, there were 31 B.S. degrees granted (from 1919 through the 1928 academic year) as well as one M.A., eight M.S., and two Ph.D. degrees. Thus, only about 42 students graduated during the first decade of the College. Cobb vigorously promoted the college in a variety of ways. As a former newspaperman, he ensured that many articles were published in the local press. The College was also the subject of attention in the national and international print media. As Dean, he was the subject of a number of profiles in various newspapers and magazines. Cobb published several articles about the College and gave talks about fisheries to various clubs and organizations in Seattle as well as towns in outlying areas. Cobb was also active in the community, holding memberships in the Arctic Club of Seattle, the Puget Sound Academy of Science, and the Aquarium Society of Seattle for which he served as founding president. All of these social engagements served as a focal point for the College and for Cobb. After spending some time in the university system, Cobb became aware that the college was not held in high esteem by many of his colleagues, likely because of its applied emphasis and lack of scholarly endeavor. Cobb initiated three actions likely designed to counter some of this criticism. In 1924 he began a research program on the passage of salmon over dams in which he was the sole investigator, he initiated in 1925 a journal of the College titled UW Publications in Fisheries, and he hired a trained ichthyologist to teach and conduct research. Cobb and the department became involved in opposing the rise of new hydroelectric dams in the Northwest. Cobb himself began research on how to pass salmon over high dams, but was not qualified to do such research. He did not seek help from either biologists or engineers and his efforts became the focus of strong criticism. Cobb's experiments were a failure and he encountered substantial criticism from various quarters. It was obvious that he did not have a sufficient background in science or engineering to conduct this work. In the late 1920s, Cobb planned to create a Department of Ichthyology that would be \\"separate\\" from the applied courses in the College. Presumably this new department would engage in \\"scholarly research.\\" In 1927, he began to search for a qualified ichthyologist to teach, conduct research, and to begin a systematic fish collection in the College. After a nation-wide search, Cobb selected Leonard Peter Schultz (1901‒1986) whom Cobb had met in 1926. Schultz had received an M.S. degree at the University of Michigan and was teaching zoology at the Michigan State Normal College at Ypsilanti. Schultz was apparently planning to pursue a Ph.D. degree in ichthyology at the University of Michigan. Schultz moved to Seattle in the fall of 1928 and immediately began to teach and to assemble a research collection of fishes. Cobb was well known for having a \\"strong personality.\\" He apparently antagonized the faculty, but the hostility of his colleagues did not surface until Cobb's incapacitation due to ill health in 1929. In a ten-page memorandum titled \\"Confidential: Conditions at the College of Fisheries\\" and signed \\"Staff,\\" the authors laid out a series of complaints against the Dean. The authors wrote that the College had lost prestige, mainly since 1925, due to the Dean's activities. They criticized Cobb's work on passage of salmon over dams complaining that he was unqualified to do so because he lacked training as a scientist and was neither a biologist nor an engineer. Complaints about his \\"science\\" also reached the news media. Later life and death John Nathan Cobb suffered from heart disease and endured a heart attack in the summer of 1929. He was ill for many months and spent his final days in the warmer climate of La Jolla, California, where he died on January 13, 1930 at the age of 61. His death was prominently noted in local newspapers and in numerous fisheries publications. Shortly after Cobb's death, Washington State Governor Roland Hill Hartley (1864‒1952) appointed a new President of the University, Matthew Lyle Spencer (1881‒1969). Spencer sought scholarship and high academic standards at the UW and he did not think highly of the College of Fisheries. Apparently, courses in canning and fishing methods did not meet the new President's criteria of scholarship. As a result, the College was dissolved in April, 1930, and all faculty of the College were dismissed, except for Leonard Schultz, who was apparently considered a bona-fide academic and was assigned to a position in the new College of Science. Uproar occurred among the students in the College who now faced a situation wherein they now had no major field. They sent a telegram to Governor Hartley protesting President Spencer's decision, stating in part that his judgment was \\"Protested by unanimous action of fisheries students.\\" Upon his inquiry of the UW, Governor Hartley was told that the Board of Regents had created a new College of Science and had elected to consolidate the College of Fisheries as a Department in the new College. A new director was appointed for the department in the person of William Francis Thompson (1888‒1965), who was to become the dominant figure in the UW Department (later, School) of Fisheries for over 16 years and the preeminent fishery scientist of the Pacific Northwest for nearly 40 years. Thompson had offices in the College of Fisheries where, since 1925, he was Director of the International Fisheries Commission (now International Pacific Halibut Commission) charged with the management of, and research on, the Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis, fishery. A Ph.D. from Stanford University, Thompson was appointed Research Professor and Director of the new department on a part-time basis, as he remained Director of the International Fisheries Commission. He remained Director of the School until 1947 when he resigned to establish and head the UW's new Fisheries Research Institute. Thompson instituted an entirely new approach to fisheries education at the UW, concentrating on the emerging field of fisheries science. He revised the curriculum to emphasize basic science and not the technology of the commercial fishing industry. To the present day, the School of Fisheries (now School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences) has continued the emphasis on fisheries science and on graduate study. Legacy Through self-education, work, and ambition, John Cobb rose from unpretentious beginnings to become dean in a major university. His career was testimony not only to the democratic ideals of the United States, but it was evidence of his competence and an affirmation of the high level of respect in which he was held by his peers. Cobb excelled in knowledge of the commercial fisheries industry. Cobb's tenure as Director (later, Dean) of the College of Fisheries from 1919 to 1930 must be considered successful, based upon the number of students enrolled in the College as well as in the records of attainment of its graduates. His approach to the educational focus of the College reflected his experience and mindset, focusing on the practical applied aspects of the commercial fishing industry. Initially, this approach was also that favored by the University administration. By the time of his death in 1930, however, it became apparent that his educational philosophy was out of date and was not accepted by the new University administration because of the College's failure to emphasize scholarly achievement. This was demonstrated by the rapid termination of the College by the UW administration upon Cobb's passing in 1930. Cobb was a well- known \\"professional\\" naturalist of his day and his reputation was based on his keen knowledge of the commercial fisheries industry which was reflected in his many publications. He was a skilled compiler of fisheries catch statistics, and he produced well-received books on the fisheries of both Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., and Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus. Cobb's position as Dean of the College of Fisheries at the University of Washington emphasized his role as a leading national expert on fisheries.

Geography  The settlement of Iracoubo, seat of the commune, is located between the settlement of Sinnamary and the hamlet of Organabo. The village of Bellevue is 5 km west of Iracoubo.  History  The commune was originally settled by Amerindians near Organabo. The first settlers arrived in 1626, but were driven back. In 1765, the Galibis who had left the area for Suriname because an epidimic had broken out, returned. In the beginning of the 19th century, Iracoubo started as a cotton plantation owned by Colonel Jacquet. In 1859, the cotton shed is donated to the community to serve as church. In the late 19th century indigenous Galibi along the Rococoua river in Counama and Organabo. In 1886 Father Raffray arrived in the village, and started to build the Saint-Joseph church which opened in 1893. Saint-Joseph became a monument in 1978. In 1912, the introduction of bananas and rosewood strengthened the economy which remains based on agriculture, hunting and fishing. Iracoubo is located on the Route National 1 connecting Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni to Cayenne. Organabo Organabo is a Galibi village located in the commune. As of 2020, the population is about 200 people, and consisted mainly of elderly people, because the youth had moved on to the city. The village used to be on the estuary of the Iracaoubo River facing the Atlantic Ocean, but is now several kilometres land inwards. The population primarily lives from fishing, and agriculture. In December 2018, the villagers were given communal land. The village is self sufficient, and therefore self isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

The production also features Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter, Barton MacLane, C. Aubrey Smith, and Sara Allgood. Its storyline is based on the 1886 gothic novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde written by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. There have been many filmed adaptations of the novella. This movie was a remake of the Oscar-winning 1931 version, starring Fredric March. Plot Dr. Henry Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) believes good and evil exist in everyone. Experiments reveal his evil side, named Mr. Hyde. Experience teaches him how evil and violent Hyde can be: he rapes Ivy Pearson (Ingrid Bergman), who earlier expressed interest in Jekyll. Meanwhile, Jekyll is preparing to marry Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner). Over the course of the film, Hyde abuses Ivy. Feeling remorse over the treatment inflicted on Ivy by his “monstrous” counterpart, Jekyll vows never to take the serum again, destroys the key to his lab, and sends money to Ivy anonymously. Ivy believes the money was sent by Hyde in order to trick her into believing she is now free. On the advice of a friend over her rattled nerves, she goes to Jekyll for comfort. Jekyll promises that Hyde will never hurt her again. On the way to Emery's house for the announcement of his marriage to Beatrix, Jekyll transforms into Hyde without taking the serum. He goes over to Ivy's house, accuses her of meeting with Jekyll, and strangles her. He escapes back to his locked lab, only to recall that he no longer has the key. He fails to break into the front door of his place, so he hurries to his friend Dr. Lanyon (Ian Hunter) for help. Lanyon is shocked to find out that both Jekyll and Hyde are the same person as Hyde drinks the antidote in his friend's presence. Jekyll decides to break off his engagement to Bea in order to keep his dark secret. She refuses to accept, her reaction triggering Jekyll to become Hyde and frighten Bea. Her father (Donald Crisp) responds to her scream, only to be beaten to death by Hyde. Lanyon later discovers a piece of Jekyll's cane at the scene, and he realizes his friend is responsible for the murder. He then leads police to search Jekyll's lab, where they find Jekyll, who earlier, as Hyde, had strong-armed past his butler, Poole (Peter Godfrey), to get to the antidote. Soon the cornered doctor starts transforming once again into Hyde as authorities question him in the lab. A struggle ensues and Lanyon shoots Hyde. As the monster dies, he reverts yet again and finally to Jekyll.

Both Hollywood productions differ greatly from the original literary work due to their heavy reliance on Thomas Russell Sullivan's 1887 stage adaptation of the story. The director for the 1941 film was Victor Fleming, who had directed Gone with the Wind and codirected The Wizard of Oz, two major releases by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1939. MGM, where Fleming was under contract, acquired full rights to the 1931 film from Paramount Pictures prior to Fleming's production. According to the Robert Louis Stevenson website being archived and preserved by the British Library, subsequent to that acquisition MGM studio executives “hid the [1931] film away to avoid competition with their remake”.“Film Versions of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: 1931 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (Mamoulian)”, The Robert Louis Stevenson Archive (RLS Website) initially developed by Edinburgh Napier University's Centre for Literature & Writing and originally funded by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.

The 1931 version then, due to ongoing legal restrictions and the lack of readily available copies, was effectively “lost” for over a quarter of a century, not generally available again for rescreenings and study until 1967. MGM's 1941 remake was produced by Victor Saville and adapted by John Lee Mahin from the screenplay of the earlier film by Percy Heath and Samuel Hoffenstein. The score was composed by Franz Waxman with uncredited contributions by Daniele Amfitheatrof and Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco. The cinematographer was Joseph Ruttenberg, the art director was Cedric Gibbons, and the costume designers were Adrian and Gile Steele. Jack Dawn created the make-up for the dissolute Mr. Hyde's appearance. =Casting= Despite having not yet met his later co-star Katharine Hepburn (they met working on Woman of the Year in 1942), Tracy originally wanted her to play both Bergman's and Turner's roles as the \\"bad\\" and \\"good\\" woman, who would then turn out to be the same person.“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)”, articles, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y.

However, Bergman, tired of playing saintly characters and fearing typecasting, pleaded with Victor Fleming that she and Turner switch roles. After a screen test, Fleming allowed Bergman to play a grittier role for the first time. ReceptionBox office= According to MGM records the film earned $2,351,000 resulting in a profit of $350,000. =Critical reception= After its preview of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in late July 1941, the trade paper Variety cited some weaknesses in the development of characters and situations in the film's plot; but, overall, the popular New York publication gave the production a very positive assessment. Variety predicted the film would be “one of the big ones for fall release” and focused special attention on Bergman's performance and screen presence.”Flin.” (1941). “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, review, Variety, July 23, 1941, p. 8, col. 2.

The trade paper, which was widely read by theater owners or “exhibitors”, complimented Fleming's pacing and staging of the story and described his “handling of the players” as “flawless”. Outside the realm of film-industry trade papers, the general public in 1941 had more mixed reviews about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. One example of those reactions can be found in the contemporary fan magazine Hollywood, which was distributed nationally each month by Fawcett Publications in Louisville, Kentucky.The magazine Hollywood (originally and briefly titled Holly Leaves) dates its history to 1912, ranking it among the earliest fan- based publications in the world.

The monthly did, though, find the film's plot passé and Tracy's Hyde far too understated in appearance to be effective: Another fan-based publication, Modern Screen, was less subtle in its November 1941 review of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, calling the film “quite the oddest picture of the year”.“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde—AB2*”, Modern Screen (New York, N.Y.), November 1941, p. 14, cols. 1-2.

The village is on a former agricultural colony founded by Anne-Marie Javouhey in 1822. The reasoning was that living, and working conditions were similar to their native land. As of 2005, the village has a population of about 1,000 people. Overview There are two primary schools, the new one just completed in 2006, a Catholic church, and the biggest Protestant church in French Guiana. There are three family owned stores, one with a gas station. There is a Sunday market, where foods, souvenirs, and Hmong crafts can be purchase. In comparison to the Hmong villages in French Guiana; Javouhey is more so a traditional Hmong-Laos village, while Cacao - a more Hmong-French village. The contrast is in the area of lifestyle; clothing, home, and practice of tradition. The best time to visit Javouhey is during the week of Christmas, when the Hmong New Year's festival is held during the hot and dry season. There is a French-owned Bungolow hotels a few minutes outside of Javouhey with minimum accommodation. Javouhey is about in size. The economy is based on agriculture.

An older binomial name for this species is Eupatorium rugosum, but the genus Eupatorium has undergone taxonomic revision by botanists, and a number of the species that were once included in it have been moved to other genera. Plants are upright or sometimes ascending, growing to tall, producing single or multi-stemmed clumps in mid to late summer and fall. The flowers are a clean white color and after blooming, small seeds with fluffy white tails are released to blow in the wind. They are found in woods and brush thickets where they bloom mid to late summer or fall. The species is adaptive to different growing conditions; it is found in woods and brush thickets and also in shady areas with open bare ground, and can be weedy in shady landscapes and hedgerows. There are two different varieties: Ageratina altissima var. altissima and Ageratina altissima var. roanensis (Appalachian white snakeroot); they differ in the length of the flower phyllaries and shape of the apices. Toxicity White snakeroot contains the toxin tremetol; when the plants are consumed by cattle, the meat and milk become contaminated with the toxin. When milk or meat containing the toxin is consumed, the poison is passed on to humans. If consumed in large enough quantities, it can cause tremetol poisoning in humans. The poisoning is also called milk sickness, as humans often ingested the toxin by drinking the milk of cows that had eaten snakeroot. Although 80% of the plant's toxin, tremetone, decreases after being dried and stored away for 5 years, its toxicity properties remain the same. Inflorescences During the early 19th century, when large numbers of European Americans from the East, who were unfamiliar with snakeroot, began settling in the plant's habitat of the Midwest and Upper South, many thousands were killed by milk sickness. Notably, milk sickness was possibly the cause of death in 1818 of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, mother of Abraham Lincoln.\\"Milk Sickness\\", National Park Service It was some decades before European Americans traced the cause to snakeroot, although today Dr. Anna Pierce Hobbs Bixby is credited with identifying the plant in the 1830s. Legend has it that she was taught about the plant's properties by a Shawnee woman.W. D. Snively, Minnesota Medicine, vol. 50, April 1967, pp. 469–476John W. Allen, It Happened in Southern Illinois, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1968 (reprint, paperback, 2010 - Google Books), pp. 5–6, accessed 1 July 2011 The Shawnee woman's name is lost to history, but she and her people doubtless had deep knowledge of the plants in the area. In addition to cattle, the plants are also poisonous to horses, goats, and sheep. Signs of poisoning in these animals include depression and lethargy, placement of hind feet close together (horses, goats, cattle) or held far apart (sheep), nasal discharge, excessive salivation, arched body posture, and rapid or difficult breathing. This plant may serve medicinal purposes. Root tea has been used to treat diarrhea, kidney stones, and fever. A root poultice can be used on snakebites. Cultivation A cultivar, sold under the name Eupatorium rugosum 'Chocolate', is grown in gardens for its dark-tinted foliage. The darkest color, which is a chocolaty black, occurs in plants grown in a sunny location. The plants are shade- tolerant and do best in moist soils. More recently, the plant can be found under the correct species name. Etymology Ageratina is derived from Greek meaning 'un-aging', in reference to the flowers keeping their color for a long time. This name was used by Dioscorides for a number of different plants.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 39, 44 Altissima means \\"the tallest\\", and probably indicates that this is the tallest species in its genus.

The five points around it are: Belmont Hill Stanmore, Horsenden Hill Greenford, Barn Hill Wembley, Dabbs Hill, St. John's Pinner. First, Harrow on the Hill's original name 'Gumeninga hergae' suggests that the pagan practises may have still been taking place on the hill – despite increasing conversion to Christianity at the time. At the same time, and more significantly, Harrow on the Hill and St. Mary's that now stands on it, also serves as an example of something that may have been widespread at the time of its construction – namely the replacement of a pagan temple by a Christian church. This practice, in rhetoric at least, is not unheard of. In the sixth and seventh centuries, Pope Gregory the Great called in his pursuit of pagan conversion churches to be built on previously pagan sites. However, St. Mary's could well be an artefact of this practice – one of the few that explicitly link back to this conversion period and Christianity's approach to pagan cultures. Harrow's famous hill, then, has significance well beyond the borders of the borough, and indeed, well beyond the borders of London. The hill, and its church, are access points – potential access points albeit – to the ancient people that are the roots and origin of the nation today, and to a time when this people underwent a considerable transformation, one that's impact continues to be seen in the present. It's something to think about, at least – not only that our old hill may have national importance, but that, when we walk its steep pastures, we tread on the site of a by-gone, medieval culture, on raw history buried in the soil. [credit Harrow Thurman] The area has four Catholic schools and three Church of England schools. Transport Harrow-on-the-Hill platform sign Harrow-on-the-Hill station, although named after the settlement, is located some distance to the north of the hill. The London Underground service at Harrow-on-the-Hill is provided by the Metropolitan line, and the station is also served by the Chiltern Railways London to Aylesbury Line. These services run in to central London, and out west/north west to the outer reaches of London and beyond. About equidistant to Harrow-on-the-Hill station from the top of the hill, is South Harrow on the Piccadilly line. The 258 and H17 London bus routes run over Harrow on the Hill itself. Street accident fatality A roadside plaque unveiled on 25 February 1969 states that the first recorded motor accident in Great Britain to have involved the death of the car driver took place at Harrow on the Hill on a road called Grove Hill seventy years earlier, on 25 February 1899. The plaque makes no mention of the name of the dead motorist, but it does name the civic dignitary who unveiled it: his name is given as Alderman Charles Stenhouse, who was Mayor of Harrow at the time. The driver involved in the crash was 31-year-old engineer Edwin Sewell, driving a 6HP Daimler. A rear wheel collapsed after breaking its rim and the car hit a sturdy brick wall. Sewell was killed immediately when he and his passenger, a Major Richer, were thrown from the vehicle. Richer died three days later in hospital.Daimler history Gives the date as July 1899 Railway accident fatality In the graveyard of St Mary's church is a gravestone recording the death of Thomas Port, from a railway accident on 7 August 1838.

It is a heritage building containing a waiting room and ticket counter built beside a set of tracks also used as a freight yard. A separate building to the east of the passenger area, originally built in 1925 as a freight building, now serves as the headquarters for the Goderich–Exeter Railway. The station is served by two daily Via Rail trains in each direction running between Sarnia and Toronto via London. On weekdays there are also 8 eastbound and 7 westbound GO Transit train trips between Kitchener and Toronto. In the times or directions that train service is not operating, GO bus route 30 Kitchener provides express service to Bramalea GO Station where passengers can connect to off-peak trains. Grand River Transit routes 4, 6, 20, 34 and 204 stop near to the station on either Weber Street or Victoria Street. History Berlin Station opened on 1 July 1856 as part of the Grand Trunk Railway line between Toronto and Berlin (now Kitchener). The railway was extended beyond Berlin to St. Marys Junction in 1858, and to Sarnia in 1859. In 1916, the town of Berlin was renamed Kitchener, and the station was renamed accordingly. The GTR built the current station building in 1897 to replace a smaller building built in 1856. The station building originally included a prominent Gothic clock tower. A second tower was added to the station after a 1908 fire. In 1966, Canadian National Railway (CN), by this point the owner of the station, removed the clock tower and the other roof features. In 1983, CN threatened to demolish the station, but Via Rail, who had assumed responsibility for CN's passenger services in 1978, opted to retain it. Under the provisions of Canada's Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act, it was designated a railway heritage structure as of February 15, 1994. Between 1982 and 2004, Kitchener was served by the Via Rail and Amtrak International Limited service between Chicago and Toronto. Pair of GO trains parked at the layover facility, located just west of the station In November 2010, a partial rollout of GO train service was announced to be in place by late 2011. Two Kitchener line trains daily serve Acton, Guelph and Kitchener with layover for those trains at a small facility in Kitchener. $18 million was spent to get this first stage operational, with further upgrades to come. Service began on December 19, serving only Kitchener and Guelph to begin with. Services Kitchener station is a stop on the Via Rail Toronto–London–Sarnia intercity train service, which forms a component of Via Rail's Corridor network. This currently consists of two trains per direction per day, but only one of these trains terminates in Sarnia, with the other terminating early in London. The station is also served by GO Transit's Kitchener line regional/commuter service connecting it to Toronto via Guelph, Georgetown, and Brampton. Kitchener is the service's western terminus. It currently consists of 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service. Eastbound trains consist of 6 commuter-oriented early morning trains, 1 mid-afternoon train, and 1 evening train. Westbound trains consist of 1 mid-afternoon train, 6 late afternoon trains, and 1 evening train. Future The Region of Waterloo plans to replace Kitchener Station with a new Kitchener Central Station located at King Street where the railway crosses the Ion light rail line. In addition to the Via Rail and GO Transit trains and buses relocated from the current facility, the new facility would also serve the new light rail line, and Greyhound and Coach Canada intercity buses which are currently served from Charles Street Transit Terminal. The Central Station light rail stop opened in 2019 along with the light rail line itself, but as of 2016 the new railway station could only open in 2022 at the earliest. A larger GO train layover facility is planned west of Kitchener near Baden, in order to allow increased train service to Kitchener. In the meantime, trains are stored in an interim yard in Kitchener off Shirley Avenue east of the station.

An FMS is a specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern civilian aircraft no longer carry flight engineers or navigators. A primary function is in-flight management of the flight plan. Using various sensors (such as GPS and INS often backed up by radio navigation) to determine the aircraft's position, the FMS can guide the aircraft along the flight plan. From the cockpit, the FMS is normally controlled through a Control Display Unit (CDU) which incorporates a small screen and keyboard or touchscreen. The FMS sends the flight plan for display to the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), Navigation Display (ND), or Multifunction Display (MFD). The FMS can be summarised as being a dual system consisting of the Flight Management Computer (FMC), CDU and a cross talk bus. The modern FMS was introduced on the Boeing 767, though earlier navigation computers did exist. Now, systems similar to FMS exist on aircraft as small as the Cessna 182. In its evolution an FMS has had many different sizes, capabilities and controls. However certain characteristics are common to all FMSs.  Navigation database  All FMSs contain a navigation database. The navigation database contains the elements from which the flight plan is constructed. These are defined via the ARINC 424 standard. The navigation database (NDB) is normally updated every 28 days, in order to ensure that its contents are current. Each FMS contains only a subset of the ARINC / AIRAC data, relevant to the capabilities of the FMS. The NDB contains all of the information required for building a flight plan, consisting of: * Waypoints/Intersection * Airways * Radio navigation aids including distance measuring equipment (DME), VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), non-directional beacons (NDBs) and instrument landing systems (ILSs). * Airports * Runways * Standard instrument departure (SID) * Standard terminal arrival (STAR) * Holding patterns (only as part of IAPs-although can be entered by command of ATC or at pilot's discretion) * Instrument approach procedure (IAP) Waypoints can also be defined by the pilot(s) along the route or by reference to other waypoints with entry of a place in the form of a waypoint (e.g. a VOR, NDB, ILS, airport or waypoint/intersection).  Flight plan  The flight plan is generally determined on the ground, before departure either by the pilot for smaller aircraft or a professional dispatcher for airliners. It is entered into the FMS either by typing it in, selecting it from a saved library of common routes (Company Routes) or via an ACARS datalink with the airline dispatch center. During preflight, other information relevant to managing the flight plan is entered. This can include performance information such as gross weight, fuel weight and center of gravity. It will include altitudes including the initial cruise altitude. For aircraft that do not have a GPS, the initial position is also required. The pilot uses the FMS to modify the flight plan in flight for a variety of reasons. Significant engineering design minimizes the keystrokes in order to minimize pilot workload in flight and eliminate any confusing information (Hazardously Misleading Information). The FMS also sends the flight plan information for display on the Navigation Display (ND) of the flight deck instruments Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS). The flight plan generally appears as a magenta line, with other airports, radio aids and waypoints displayed. Special flight plans, often for tactical requirements including search patterns, rendezvous, in-flight refueling tanker orbits, calculated air release points (CARP) for accurate parachute jumps are just a few of the special flight plans some FMSs can calculate.  Position determination  Once in flight, a principal task of the FMS is to determine the aircraft's position and the accuracy of that position. Simple FMS use a single sensor, generally GPS in order to determine position. But modern FMS use as many sensors as they can, such as VORs, in order to determine and validate their exact position. Some FMS use a Kalman filter to integrate the positions from the various sensors into a single position. Common sensors include: * Airline-quality GPS receivers act as the primary sensor as they have the highest accuracy and integrity. * Radio aids designed for aircraft navigation act as the second highest quality sensors. These include; ** Scanning DME (distance measuring equipment) that check the distances from five different DME stations simultaneously in order to determine one position every 10 seconds. ** VORs (VHF omnidirectional radio range) that supply a bearing. With two VOR stations the aircraft position can be determined, but the accuracy is limited. * Inertial reference systems (IRS) use ring laser gyros and accelerometers in order to calculate the aircraft position. They are highly accurate and independent of outside sources. Airliners use the weighted average of three independent IRS to determine the “triple mixed IRS” position. The FMS constantly crosschecks the various sensors and determines a single aircraft position and accuracy. The accuracy is described as the Actual Navigation Performance (ANP) a circle that the aircraft can be anywhere within measured as the diameter in nautical miles. Modern airspace has a set required navigation performance (RNP). The aircraft must have its ANP less than its RNP in order to operate in certain high-level airspace.  Guidance  Given the flight plan and the aircraft's position, the FMS calculates the course to follow. The pilot can follow this course manually (much like following a VOR radial), or the autopilot can be set to follow the course. The FMS mode is normally called LNAV or Lateral Navigation for the lateral flight plan and VNAV or vertical navigation for the vertical flight plan. VNAV provides speed and pitch or altitude targets and LNAV provides roll steering command to the autopilot.  VNAV  Sophisticated aircraft, generally airliners such as the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 and other turbofan powered aircraft, have full performance Vertical Navigation (VNAV). The purpose of VNAV is to predict and optimize the vertical path. Guidance includes control of the pitch axis and control of the throttle. In order to have the information necessary to accomplish this, the FMS must have a detailed flight and engine model. With this information, the function can build a predicted vertical path along the lateral flight plan. This detailed flight model is generally only available from the aircraft manufacturer. During pre-flight, the FMS builds the vertical profile. It uses the initial aircraft empty weight, fuel weight, centre of gravity and initial cruise altitude, plus the lateral flight plan. A vertical path starts with a climb to cruise altitude. Some SID waypoints have vertical constraints such as \\"At or ABOVE 8,000\\". The climb may use a reduced thrust or \\"FLEX\\" climb to save stress on the engines. Each must be considered in the predictions of the vertical profile. Implementation of an accurate VNAV is difficult and expensive, but it pays off in fuel savings primarily in cruise and descent. In cruise, where most of the fuel is burned, there are multiple methods for fuel savings. As an aircraft burns fuel it gets lighter and can cruise higher where there is less drag. Step climbs or cruise climbs facilitate this. VNAV can determine where the step or cruise climbs (in which the aircraft climbs continuously) should occur to minimize fuel consumption. Performance optimization allows the FMS to determine the best or most economical speed to fly in level flight. This is often called the ECON speed. This is based on the cost index, which is entered to give a weighting between speed and fuel efficiency. The cost index is calculated by dividing the per- hour cost of operating the plane by the cost of fuel. Generally a cost index of 999 gives ECON speeds as fast as possible without consideration of fuel and a cost index of zero gives maximum efficiency. ECON mode is the VNAV speed used by most airliners in cruise. RTA or required time of arrival allows the VNAV system to target arrival at a particular waypoint at a defined time. This is often useful for airport arrival slot scheduling. In this case, VNAV regulates the cruise speed or cost index to ensure the RTA is met. The first thing the VNAV calculates for the descent is the top of descent point (TOD). This is the point where an efficient and comfortable descent begins. Normally this will involve an idle descent, but for some aircraft an idle descent is too steep and uncomfortable. The FMS calculates the TOD by “flying” the descent backwards from touchdown through the approach and up to cruise. It does this using the flight plan, the aircraft flight model and descent winds. For airline FMS, this is a very sophisticated and accurate prediction, for simple FMS (on smaller aircraft) it can be determined by a “rule of thumb” such as a 3 degree descent path. From the TOD, the VNAV determines a four- dimensional predicted path. As the VNAV commands the throttles to idle, the aircraft begins its descent along the VNAV path. If either the predicted path is incorrect or the downpath winds different from the predictions, then the aircraft will not perfectly follow the path. The aircraft varies the pitch in order to maintain the path. Since the throttles are at idle this will modulate the speed. Normally the FMS allows the speed to vary within a small band. After this, either the throttles advance (if the aircraft is below path) or the FMS requests speed brakes with a message such as “ADD DRAG” (if the aircraft is above path). An ideal idle descent, also known as a “green descent” uses the minimum fuel, minimizes pollution (both at high altitude and local to the airport) and minimizes local noise. While most modern FMS of large airliners are capable of idle descents, most air traffic control systems cannot handle multiple aircraft each using its own optimum descent path to the airport, at this time. Thus the use of idle descents is minimized by Air Traffic Control.

The Golghar falls to its west. During the period of 1824–1833, under British rule, it was used as a golf course and horse racing track and was called Patna Lawns. It is spread across 60 acres of land. History Several movements were launched on the Patna Lawns during the Indian freedom struggle, the most important being the Champaran movement and the Quit India movement of 1942. Many prominent leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, such as Mohandas K. Gandhi, Rajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Jaya Prakash Narayan and Sri Krishna Sinha addressed their rallies from here. It was said that a leader had not arrived until he had addressed a rally at the Patna Lawns. JP Movement, the successful opposition movement to Indira Gandhi, was also launched from this historic ground. Presently, this ground is used for private parties, mass prayers and trade fairs. The flag-raising ceremony on the Indian Independence Day and Republic Day is held here by the Chief Minister and Governor of Bihar respectively. In the north western corner lies the Gandhi Sangrahalaya, which showcases various pictures and records of Mahatma Gandhi's presence and connections with Bihar. During 1947, it was the house of the Education Minister, Dr. Syed Mahmud. These grounds are situated near Ashok Rajpath in Moradpur and are 2.5 km from central Patna. During his Bihar visit at the time of Champaran Satyagraha, Mahatma Gandhi addressed a huge meeting at Patna Lawns. That meeting was the first time Indians were allowed to visit Patna Lawn without any restrictions. Until then, entry was restricted to Europeans and the elite (Loyalist Indians). The historic Patna Lawn was renamed Gandhi Maidan in 1948 after his assassination as a tribute. A statue of Gandhi was erected in 1990s near the southern end.

The company then limited its revolver production to relatively unpopular designs by Edward Maynard until 1857, when Colt's patent expired. Maynard patented his revolutionary breechloading rifle in 1851. It was actually manufactured by Massachusetts Arms, which had been using Maynard's system under contract for several years. In 1855 they produced 2,000 Greene Carbines, a Maynard system firearm, for a British government contract. These carbines were NOT used in the Crimean War. Maynard's rifle was operated by a lever which when depressed raised the barrel to open the breech for loading. A brass cartridge, also developed by Maynard, was then inserted and the lever raised to close the breech. Once cocked the loaded rifle could then be primed by either placing a percussion cap directly on its nipple or by using Maynard's patented priming system to advance a primer to the nipple. Also in 1857 the company received a contract to manufacture Adams revolvers under license for the U.S. government. Some 500 or so were produced and used in the U.S. Civil War. The company also produced single- and double-barrel shotguns, including both box-locks and external central hammers. Later it manufactured a selection of 20- and 28-bore Maynard-action shotguns of 1865 and 1873 patterns. With civil war looming some Southern states purchased Maynard rifles from the company for their state militias. Of close to 3000 sales, most were to Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The First Model Maynard was designated an official Confederate firearm. The factory burned down in January 1861, halting production until the factory was rebuilt in 1863. The company then received an order for 20,000 of the simpler Second Model Maynard carbines. Deliveries of these guns began in June 1864 continuing through May 1865. As the war was then coming to an end few saw service. Some, however, are known to have been used by the 9th and 11th Indiana Cavalry and the 11th Tennessee Cavalry regiments. In 1893 the company was purchased by the J Stevens Arms & Tool Company, also founded by Joshua Stevens. Stevens had left the Massachusetts Arms Company in 1864. The purchase was made to protect the interests of Edward Maynard's widow and provide security for the company's workers. In the late 19th century the company began producing revolvers on various Smith & Wesson patterns. Production continued until the factory closed permanently during the Great Depression. The Massachusetts Arms Company name was retained by Stevens and later used as a trade name for firearms produced for sale at the Blish, Mize and Silliman Hardware Company of Atchison, Kansas.

Privately owned, the gardens – but not the house itself – are open to the public seven days a week from late March until late October. It is one of the main tourist attractions in the town.  History  Abbey House dates from the 16th century, built on 13th century foundations, with some evidence of a substantial house on the site as early as the 11th century. It has been extensively renovated and extended since, particularly in Tudor times. The site is adjacent to Malmesbury Abbey, which was founded in the 7th century and completed in its present form by the 12th century. The house was possibly begun in the 13th century as the dorter (domitory) and reredorter (latrine) of the abbey. In 1539, the abbey was sold by Henry VIII to a local clothier, William Stumpe, who also bought the site and lived in it himself. In 1498, Stumpe or his son James rebuilt the home in the Tudor style; the old section of the house remains mostly unchanged since then. The lower parts of the 13th-century building survive in the undercroft. The house and its grounds were handed down through the Stumpe family, which by the time of the English Civil War had married into the Ivey family. The house remained in private hands and in the 1920s was bought by Captain Elliot Scott McKirdy, who (with architect Harold Brakspear) enlarged the house to its current size of by adding a nursery wing and servants' quarters, keeping the same exterior style. The building was recorded as Grade I listed in 1949. The house was bought in 1968 by the Deaconess Community of St Andrew, who ran it as a base for parish ministry and as a home for its elderly sisters and guests until 1990. Walls and arches in the garden incorporate fragments of 12th-century carved stone, re-used from the abbey.  Present day  thumb In 1994, Abbey House was bought by Ian and Barbara Pollard, who had previously owned and run Hazelbury Manor, another mansion near Box in Wiltshire. They set about transforming the , and opened the gardens to the public in 1996. In 1998, a large skeleton was unearthed in the gardens, close to the site of the ruined Lady Chapel of Malmesbury Abbey. The find was featured in the TV archaeology show Meet the Ancestors, whose experts recreated the skeleton and speculated that it was probably a 13th-century monk or abbot who walked with a limp and had a toothache. In 2001 and increasingly in 2002, the gardens were brought to wider public attention, particularly through the acclamation of Alan Titchmarsh, who devoted an episode of the BBC TV programme Gardeners' World to Abbey House Gardens, broadcast in June 2002. On the week of transmission, the Pollards were featured in that week's edition of Radio Times. As well as the gardens, the Pollards also became known as 'The Naked Gardeners'. Both Ian and Barbara, particularly Ian, spoke freely of their love of naturism, and were often featured in newspapers and magazines, pictured naked among the foliage of Abbey House. The couple became, for a short time, the resident gardening experts on ITV's This Morning, but the timing was not good: within a few weeks the show was struck by the sex scandal that engulfed presenter John Leslie. In August 2005, and again in 2006, Abbey House Gardens hosted what were thought to be the first 'Clothes Optional Days' at a major inland British tourist attraction. Naturists from all over the country flocked to the gardens, and as many as two-thirds of the visitors on those day enjoyed the gardens in the nude. Similar clothing-optional days are held regularly a few times a year. The gardens include over 10,000 different plants. After Ian Pollard's death in April 2019, Abbey House Gardens was taken over by Ian's son Rufus and his wife Kristen, and so the house and gardens remain in the Pollard family.

It is part of the Central Coast Council local government area. At the , The Entrance had a population of 3,873 people. The town occupies an area of land that is bounded by water on three sides. The Entrance gains its name from the channel that runs along much of its northern border that is the entrance to Tuggerah Lakes. The Entrance has been a popular holiday destination since the first guest house was established there in 1885. As a beloved \\"holiday playground of two cities\\", the town continues to grow with new tourist accommodation, including the Pullman Hotel at North Entrance, the redevelopment of residential areas, and the enhancement of recreational facilities. The district's main tourist attractions are its beaches, lake and town centre. It is also suitably located for day trips to the Hunter Valley vineyards. HistorySettlements at The Entrance= It is believed Europeans first discovered it in 1796. It was found by Governor of Tasmania, Colonel David Collins, who had arrived on the First Fleet during the search for an escaped convict woman, Mary Morgan, who was said to be living with the Aborigines to the North of the Hawkesbury River. The area now known as The Entrance was occupied by Henry Holden in 1828. He occupied and was bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the eastern side, Tuggerah Lake on the northern and western sides and extended all the way to the current Toowoon Bay Road. Holden named the property Towoon. In 1835 the deeds were issued to John Edye Manning and he sold the land for £200 to Thomas Cade Battley who renamed the property Terilbah.Pratt, Eileen (1978) Place Names of the Central Coast. Brisbane Water Historical Society and The Entrance and District Society. p49 Both Battley and Manning have streets named in their honour at The Entrance. In 1850, ownership was transferred to the Taylor Family and it was referred to as Tuggerah Beach. The land remained privately owned until about 1900 when it was divided up among the twelve children of Richard Brown Taylor and Norberta Maria Gertrude (née Watkins). The Taylors donated land to the Roman Catholic Church, The Church of England and The Entrance Public School. Many streets in the area are named after them including Taylor Street, Richard Street, Norberta Street and Victoria Street. On 15 December 1910, Karagi Receiving Office was opened. Karagi, meaning the entrance, was the Aboriginal name for the point on the south bank of the channel at the Pacific Ocean, a name which has since been officially adopted. On 1 June 1911, Karagi Receiving Office was designated a post office. The name Karagi was changed on 15 November 1911 and the name \\"The Entrance\\" was adopted. =Growth= Bayview guest house In 1889 the railway line was completed from Sydney to Newcastle and tourism began to develop in the area during the late 19th century following the construction of several guest houses. The first guest house in the area was built at The Entrance North by Mr and Mrs Walter Denniss in 1885 and was called Dunleith Guest House. Bayview Guest House was the first to be opened in the Entrance and was opened in 1900Stinson, Edward. A Pictorial History of the Wyong Shire: Volume 1 1979. Wyong Shire Council. . p. 142. by Mr and Mrs Dening (née Taylor). Pinehurst Guest House was another that was constructed in 1903 by Les Taylor and was by far the largest at that time. By 1912, members of the Taylor family were operating four guest houses at The Entrance. In March 1920, 200 parcels of land were auctioned after it had become clear that the land in the township needed to be subdivided. Each block of land averaged a selling price of £60 to £80, although some blocks closer to the water sold for as much as £200. Immediately holiday houses began to be built rapidly. It also resulted in a total of 15 guest houses operating soon after, including Lakeside built by Rene Johnson (née Taylor) that was the most exclusive (the building has since relocated to Wyee). Although competition was fierce, the guesthouses had high occupancy rates in the booming times. Bayview Avenue, Ozone Street, and Lakeside Parade are named after guest houses that were located at The Entrance. Despite the growth, the area was still isolated and access was restricted to a wagon on the bush track from Gosford or by a ferry from Wyong. The area was popular among fishermen and prior to 1908 the majority of boats that travelled to The Entrance used Tuggerah Jetty, the remains of which, still exists on the shore of Tuggerah Lake between the entrances to Wyong River and Ourimbah Creek. When Wyong River was dredged in 1908, the boats would take their catch into Wyong. Prime Minister Menzies, Mrs Menzies, and their daughter Miss. H. Menzies visited the town in October 1953. The Prime Minister spoke with the pupils at The Entrance Public School and spent the evening at the Floral Ball held at The Palm Grove Dance Hall. It was reported in The Gosford Times that \\"It was most probably the most magnificent floral display ever assembled ...in this district\\". There was a proposal for the railway to have a branch line to The Entrance. The proposed route would have left the Main North line just south of Chittaway Creek and terminated at present day Taylor Park. There was also a proposal for a local government area to be named and centred on The Entrance. Prior to 2016, The Entrance was part of the former Wyong Shire. Transport The construction of Wyong Wharf allowed greater access to The Entrance and the demand for ferry transport boomed. Numerous operators took advantage of the demand and ferries such as Wyong, Waiwera, Loongana and Maheno were making regular journeys across Tuggerah Lake. In 1922, the bush track to Wyong was opened as a road. By the end of the nineteen-twenties the ferries were rendered obsolete by buses that could reach The Entrance quickly and cheaply.Stinson, Edward. A Pictorial History of the Wyong Shire: Volume 1 1979. Wyong Shire Council. . p. 29. Panoramic view of The Entrance Bridge The Entrance Bridge links The Entrance with The Entrance North over The Entrance Channel as part of Wilfred Barrett Drive. It was originally a wooden single lane bridge with bypass bays and a traffic light that allowed traffic travelling in the opposite direction to pass. It was opened in 1934. The original bridge was adequate until 1965 as it only served traffic travelling as far as The Entrance North. By the end of 1965 the traffic flow over the old bridge at The Entrance increased to such an extent the structure was under constant repair. Work began on the current two lane, concrete structure on 17 July 1967 after a successful tender by Transbridge Pty Ltd. The bridge was opened to traffic on 20 December 1968 and officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Robert Askin on 18 April 1969.Pry, Kathryn. Fenton, Joan. History of Wyong Shire: 1947-1997 1997. Wyong Shire Council. . pp. 113–114. The Entrance is serviced by Red Bus Services, and the town is the major terminus, with several routes terminating and beginning in Torrens Avenue. Generally, Red Bus Services run every 30 to 60 minutes from 5am to 12am. The depot for The Entrance Red Bus was on the corner of Denning Street and Blue Bay Road until the early 1980s, the site became the \\"St. Tropez\\" building. Culture Pelican feeding at The Entrance The Entrance Cinema is a well-known local icon. It is located on the corner of The Entrance Road and Bayview Mall. The cinema was opened as The Prince Edward Theatre in 1934 and was immediately popular due to the fire that burnt the other cinema in The Entrance, the Wintergarden Theatre in the same year. The Prince Edward Theatre closed in 1977 but was reopened in 1981 when it was purchased and converted into a smaller cinema. A second screen was added in 1988.Pry, Kathryn. Fenton, Joan. History of Wyong Shire: 1947-1997 1997. Wyong Shire Council. . p. 221. The cinema achieved notoriety in 2006 when it refused to screen the film, The Da Vinci Code as it was contrary to the owner's beliefs. There is a history walk along the main street and the ocean front boardwalk. This identifies with both text and photos important historic sites in the town. It is ideally suited for school groups to understand 20th century social and environmental development. In 1999, The Entrance waterfront was named 'The Pelican Capital of Australia' by Wyong Shire Council to coincide with the opening of a pelican feeding platform as part of the waterfront redevelopment. The daily practice attracts 20,000 visitors annually. The Entrance is the perfect place for fishing. There are many species of fish that can be found in the area such as whiting, flathead, bream, and blackfish.

The Entrance town centre is located predominately along The Entrance Road, extending from Dening Street (named after the original owners of Bayview Guest House.) to The Entrance Bridge. Lakeside Shopping Centre containing a Coles supermarket and speciality stores, is located on the corner of The Entrance Road and Dening Street. The main street of the town (The Entrance Road) has approximately 200 shops, banks and services. Most stores are independent retailers, with only a small number of chain stores in the town. There is an increasing number of specialist food stores including bakeries, patisserie, two confectionery stores, one of the few specialist Asian supermarkets on the Central Coast, and three bottle shops. Markets are held each week. Legal, medical, the library, Australia Post and political offices are also located within the town. Medicare is co-located with Centrelink in Torrens Avenue. At the northern end of the main street the stores focus on the needs of tourists with fashion, cafes, and restaurants. 2000 cars are located throughout the town including Lakeside Shopping Centre, Theatre Lane, Ocean Parade, and Coral Street. Wyong Shire Council has an office in the town. The Entrance has two hotels, both located on The Entrance Road, these being the newer \\"The Lakes\\", opened in the 1940s, and the original \\"The Entrance Hotel\\" opened in the 1920s. Both contain original architectural features. = Golden Gate Cafe = A classic Australian milk bar, having opened to serve patrons to the Price Edward Cinema. It features a number of characteristics including booth seating, mirror displays, sweet and lolly counters. It has been operated by \\"Johhny\\" and his family for decades. Most children from the town would have memories of getting bags of lollies from Johnies either after school or before seeing a movie. It is an important cultural aspect to the town.  Mardi Gras  To celebrate the start of the summer tourist season, held traditionally on the first full weekend in December, The Entrance holds its annual Mardi Gras festival. The first Mardi Gras was held in 1950, and as such is one of the oldest town festivals in NSW. Mardi Gras is a major event of the town and district for the year. The festival is named Mardi Gras after the spirit of the carnivals and Mardi Gras of Europe. The event contains a number of events including fun runs, concerts, fireworks and displays. The highlight is the parade. This contains numerous floats from local commercial, sporting, and community organisations. Due to a lack of funds Mardi Gras was not held in 2013. Mardi Gras returned in 2014 with some 75 groups participating and an attendance in excess of 12 500 people. In 2015 Mardi Gras was held on the last weekend in November.  Clubs, sport, and leisure facilities  The Entrance is fortunate to have a broad selection of sporting, both organised and casual, facilities. This includes The Entrance Ocean Baths – a three pool salt water complex with free access all year around. Taylor Park is the main playing field in the town hosting cricket matches. The Entrance beach has one of the oldest surf clubs in the region, housed in an art deco building overlooking the beach. The Entrance Skate Park at Picnic Point allows free access to a purpose built skate board area. The Entrance Cycle & Walking track, is a concrete path starting in at Picnic Point allowing for off road cycling alongside the lake. Fishing and boat ramp facilities are located at Picnic Point. The Entrance Memorial Park is located at the heart of the town and features a band stand with stunning views across the channel and lake. The park is home to the town Christmas tree, festooned with coloured lights every December. 1st Tuggerah Lakes Scout Group is the local Scout Troop. Established in 1932, they have a rich history and tradition of supporting children and young people in the town. They have a large, modern, group headquarters located in Baden-Powell reserve. The Entrance District Cricket Club, founded in 1912, has become an extremely strong force in Central Coast cricket, both on and off the field. The development of juniors which commenced in the 1970s, the business-like approach of the club’s administration including corporate sponsorship, the coaching programs and the ability of the club to have the right mix of youth and experience on the playing field, have combined to see the club take out premierships throughout the grades as well as being Club Champions on a number of occasions.  Church services  Churches in the town provide services to Catholic (Our Lady of the Rosary), Anglican (All Saints), Uniting, and Presbyterian (St. Andrew's) faiths.  Education  Within The Entrance town there is a one state public primary school, The Entrance Public School. It is a K–6 school, having been established in November 1915 with an enrollment of 10 students. Previously a split site school, with the infants located on Oakland Avenue, it has been amalgamated into a single site with new buildings since the early 2000s. The school covers the district from North Entrance to Shelly Beach. The school colours are yellow and green, with a motto of \\"Onward & Upward\\". The school includes students who would have previously been educated at The Entrance North Public School (TEN PS), which was closed in the 1989 due to low enrollments. The school colours were red and white. Glenvale Special School is located at The Entrance North, on the former grounds of TEN PS. It is a dual campus school, with a main campus at Narara near Gosford. The school colours are blue and white. The Entrance High School was opened in 1970 and is located at Shelly Beach. The school colours were red and green. It has since become the senior campus for Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic School was located within the church grounds from 1952 until the 1990s. The school was a split site school from the 1970s when the infants school, \\"The Little School\\", was located on Shelly Beach road. The sites switched in 1987 with the primary school moving to Shelly Beach and the little school moving to the church grounds at The Entrance. The school is now located K–6 at Shelly Beach as a function of The Entrance Parish. The school colours are blue and gold. St. Peter's Catholic College is the parish secondary 7–12 school for Our Lady of the Rosary. It is located in Tuggerah. The school colours are red, green, and blue. Two of the main people who actively pursued the creation of the school were Father Reynolds (PP 1953–1980) and Father Brogan (PP 1979 – 1990s), Parish Priests at OLR The Entrance for many years.

The licensed legal professions are as follows: Main courtroom at Polish Constitutional Tribunal * judge (); * prosecutor (), legal representative of the State, with the exception of trials involving the Treasury, their primary duties include prosecution, supervision over police investigations and acting on behalf of public interest in all trials; * solicitor of the Treasury (), legal representative of the Treasury where significant State property is at stake, their representation is also mandatory in all trials involving the Treasury at central courts, * advocate (), whose main function is to provide legal assistance, prepare legal opinions and drafts of legislative acts, and represent persons before court in civil, administrative and criminal trials; * attorney at law (also translated as: legal counsel or legal advisor ), whose main function is to provide legal assistance, prepare legal opinions and drafts of legislative acts, and represent persons before courts in civil, administrative and criminal trials; * notary (), whose job consists of mixture of civil law notary and notary public duties; * bailiffhttp://www.europe-eje.eu/en/fiches- thematiques/pays/pologne (), a public officer (but not an official) whose main function is to execute court's decisions concerning civil claims. Columns of the Supreme Court of Poland building Some legal professions may also be performed by graduates in other specific disciplines, such as economics or engineering. They require an appropriate admission examination to be passed, as such jurists are authorised to represent persons before courts in matters related to their profession. Such occupations include inter alia: * tax advisor (), whose main function is to advise persons in tax matters, represent them before courts and State authorities in tax matters and perform other activities related to tax law; * patent attorney (), whose job consists of rendering legal assistance in industrial property matters.  The distinction between advocates and attorneys at law  The division adwokat / radca prawny was created by a 1959 law which forbade advocates from advising socialised economy units (primarily state enterprises, and cooperatives, which were the dominant form of economic activity in the People's Republic of Poland), and introduced the new profession of radca prawny for that purpose. Advocates and attorneys at law have their own independent bar associations (both are members of CCBE - The Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe); membership is obligatory for those willing to practice the respective profession: :* Advocates: The Polish Bar Council (ca 7,600 members); :* Attorneys at law: National Chamber of Attorneys at Law (ca 50,000 members). Currently, admission to the Polish Bar Council is open to the members of the National Chamber of Attorneys at Law, and vice versa. Lawyers can be members of both bar associations at the same time, however they cannot practice both professions concurrently. Since 2015, the position and rights of advocates and attorneys at law are identical in almost all matters, leading to public discussion on the unification of the two professions.Article in \\"Rzeczpospolita\\" newspaper (21 July 2016) - \\"Advocates and legal advisors prefer to function separately, the Ministry does not preclude a merger\\" Legal regulations regarding the two professions slightly differ:Summary by the National Chamber of Legal Advisors (online) :* Attorneys at law can enter into any employment contract while practicing their profession; however if they defend persons charged in criminal trials they cannot remain employed under employment contract; :* Advocates cannot enter into any employment contract while practicing their profession (this includes being hired as an in-house lawyer or as an associate attorney or salaried partner at a law firm, although it is commonly evaded through self-employment); The two bar associations have their own rules and ethical codes according to which:Advocate's Code of Ethics (online)Legal Advisor's Code of Ethics (online) :* Attorneys at law are allowed to publish information about their services (advertisement being forbidden); advocates' rules in this matter are much stricter; :* advocates are subject to important limitations applying to the kind of business activities that they are allowed to undertake; the following actions are forbidden by the Advocates' Code of Ethics as colliding with the advocate's profession, while they are fully allowed to be performed by attorneys at law: :::- holding the manager's position in another person's business entity; :::- holding the position of a member of the management board or proxy in commercial partnerships and companies, with the exception of law firms; :::- acting as a regular commercial agent; :::- running the same office with a person rendering other services, if they collide with advocates' ethical rule While the Polish term radca prawny was usually literally translated to legal advisor, in 2018 the bar adopted attorney at law as the official translation, to avoid a misconception that its members only provide legal consulation and advise, rather than full range of legal services, including representing their clients in courtshttps://www.oirpwarszawa.pl/wp- content/uploads/2018/09/uchwa%C5%82a-102_2018-KRRP.pdf.  Admission to practice law  There are no bar associations for judges and public prosecutors - the Ministry of Justice is in charge of the administration of the professions (judges are appointed by the President). Advocates, attorneys at law, notaries, bailiffs, patent attorneys, and tax advisors do have their bar associations. There are several ways of admission to the bar. As to advocates and attorneys at law, the following options are available:Act of 26 May 1982 - Law on AdvocatesAct of 6 July 1982 on Legal Advisors * Master's degree in Law followed by bar training () and bar exam; * Master's degree in Law followed by 5 years of legal professional experience and bar exam; * Ph.D. in Law followed by either bar exam or 3 years of legal professional experience; * High academic qualification in legal sciences (habilitated doctor, professor). = Bar training (aplikacja) = An examination for admission to bar training for advocates and attorneys at law is a written test, 100 out of 150 points guarantee admission. The examination covers: 1) criminal law and criminal procedure; 2) infraction law and infraction court proceedings; 3) financial criminal law and financial criminal proceedings; 4) civil law and civil procedure; 5) family law; 6) public business law; 7) commercial companies and partnerships law; 8) labour law and social security regulations; 9) administrative law and administrative procedure; 10) administrative court proceedings; 11) European Union law; 12) constitutional law; 13) organization of justice in Poland. Bar training for advocates and attorneys at law lasts for three years and consists of theoretical and practical classes. Each trainee () has his/her individual tutor, who must be a practitioner from the respective bar. Bar examination is a written exam which lasts 4 days and consists of preparing various documents and briefs in following areas: criminal law, civil or family law, commercial law, administrative law, ethics. Bar training for notaries is slightly shorter (2,5 years) and covers different areas of law. = Professional training for judges and public prosecutors = The body in charge of training for future judges and public prosecutors is The National School of Judiciary and Public Prosecution in Kraków.The Polish National School of Judiciary and Public Prosecution After one-year general training, the candidates proceed to a specialised training (judge/public prosecutor) for another 30 months. Then, trainee judges serve internships as law clerks (12 months) and as referendaries (). Similar internship is provided for public prosecutors.Act of 23 January 2009 on The National School of Judiciary and Public Prosecution = Bar members = Once admitted to the bar association of one occupation, a jurist can move to another occupation with little hassle. Only judges, public prosecutors, notaries, professors and habilitated doctors of laws can write certoriaris to the Constitutional Tribunal in cases in which they themselves are sides. All others must use services of advocates or attorneys at law.Art. 48 of the Act of 1 August 1997 on the Constitutional Tribunal Certioraris to the Supreme Court must always be prepared by an advocate or a legal advisor.Art. 526 of the Act of 6 June 1997 - Code of Penal Procedure Lawyers who are not members of any bar association Many jurists do not practice law in the strict sense. They may work in public administration (which has its own highly legalized proceedings), the police (which prosecute small crimes), tax services and similar governmental agencies. Additionally, since a company can be represented in civil court by its own employees, some small and medium companies do not employ barristers or counselors, but instead rely on in-house lawyers not admitted to bar. Because under Polish law an agent can act for any person therefore some lawyers do what in the UK is done by solicitors. Thus, specialized persons write legal agreements, perform negotiations, or execute debts. Polish law specifically permits persons with Magister's degree in Law to give legal advice. Sample law firms in Poland There are numerous law firms in Poland, both small local firms and affiliate or branch offices of international law firms. Most international law firms have their Polish offices in Warsaw.

It is often regarded as Malaysia's top private university in Malaysia based on the Quacquarelli Symonds Rankings,. It was founded in 1969 as a college, was awarded university college status in 2006, and university status in 2010. Taylor's University is a member of the Taylor's Education Group. History The first campus was located at a building in Jalan Pantai, Kuala Lumpur offering the Victorian Higher School Certificate (VHSC) programme for a student population of 345. In 1985, Taylor's moved to its second campus in PJ New Town. Four years later, the Subang Jaya Campus was launched and two new pre-university programmes were introduced: the Canadian Pre-University Programme (CPU) and South Australian Matriculation (SAM). By 1990, more programmes were introduced, including the American Degree Programme; Architecture, Quantity Surveying and Construction; Business, Accounting, Marketing and Finance; Cambridge A Level; Computer Science, Software Engineering and IT; Engineering; Hospitality, Tourism and Culinary Arts; and the Taylor's Business Foundation. In 2001, the fourth campus in Wisma Subang housing the Taylor's Business School was launched. The following year, Taylor's College Petaling Jaya (TCPJ) became the fifth campus at Leisure Commerce Square, and Taylor's School of Hospitality and Tourism was relocated from Kuala Lumpur to this new campus. TCPJ also housed the School of Communication, School of Architecture, Building and Design, and Taylor's School of Computing. In 2004, the sixth campus was launched in Subang Square housing the American Degree Programme. More expansion came with the launch of the seventh campus in Sri Hartamas (TCSH) in 2008. This campus was able to accommodate 800 students and ran the Cambridge A Level programme, South Australian Matriculation programme and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Work commenced on the RM450 million Taylor's University Lakeside Campus in Subang Jaya in early 2007 and was completed in 2010. In January 2018, Taylor’s College was moved to the Lakeside Campus. Lakeside Campus Taylor's University established its Lakeside Campus in 2010 to accommodate the ever-expanding number of students. On the grounds of the campus itself lies Syopz, a commercial block with restaurants and shops. U Residence, the official accommodation for students, is also located there.

Around 60 percent of those who complete a law degree typically practice law, with the remainder primarily working in business (especially finance, insurance, real estate, and consulting) or government or policy roles, where their degrees also confer advantages. (Other types of legal education, such as that of paralegals, of Limited Practice Officers (in Washington), and of the citizenry in general, and of the education of lawyers after admission to the bar (continuing legal education) are not covered in this article.)  History  The first law schools in Europe = The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the glossators of the 11th century, which were schools of law.Catholic Encyclopedia The first European university, that of Bologna, was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the glossator school in that city. The first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The University of Bologna served as the model for other law schools of the medieval age.Antonio García y García, “The Faculties of Law,\\" A History of the University in Europe, Cambridge University Press, 1992; page 389. Although it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of Roman Law. Although Oxford did teach canonical law, its importance was always superior to civil law in that institution.Id. at 390 =Early legal education in England= In England in 1292, when Edward I first requested that lawyers be trained, law students merely sat in the courts and observed. Over time, the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences. This practice led to the institution of the Inns of Court system.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 430. The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of moot court-like practice and lecture, and observation of court proceedings.Id. at 431. By the 17th century, the Inns obtained a status as a kind of university akin to Oxford and Cambridge, though very specialized in purpose.Id. at 432 With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the Crusades, the importance of the lawyer's role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew.Id. at 433. The apprenticeship program for solicitors emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programs for the tradesId. at 434. Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law, and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. These universities, therefore, did not train lawyers.Id. at 435. Professional training in England was unlike that of continental Europe, where the law was viewed as an academic discipline. Legal educators in England stressed practical training.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003). The training of solicitors by apprenticeship was formally established by an act of parliament in 1729.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, and 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 435. William Blackstone became the first lecturer of law at Oxford in 1753. The university did not establish the program for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were very philosophical and theoretical in nature. Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure obtained through apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 793. The Inns of Court continued but became less effective. No significant educational activity or examination was required for bar admission. In 1846, the Parliament examined the education and training of prospective barristers and found the system to be inferior to the legal education provided in Europe and the United States.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, and 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 436 Therefore, formal schools of law were called for, but not finally established until later in the century. Even then, the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions.Id. at 436. = Legal education in the North American colonies and the United States = Initially there was much resistance to lawyers in colonial North America because of the role they played in hierarchical England. Slowly the colonial governments started using the services of professionals trained in the Inns of Court, and by the end of the Revolution there was a functional bar in each state.Id. at 775. As institutions for training developed in the colonies, because of the distrust of a profession only open to the elite in England, the institutions which developed in what would become the United States would be much different from those in England.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 429. Initially in the United States, the legal professionals were trained and imported from England.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 438. A formal apprenticeship or clerkship program was established first in New York in 1730—at that time a seven-year clerkship was required, and in 1756 a four- year college degree was required in addition to five years of clerking and an examination.Id. at 439 Later the requirements were reduced to require only two years of college education.Idem. A system like the Inns did not develop, however, and a college education was not required in England until the 19th century, so the American system was unique. The clerkship program required much individual study. The mentoring lawyer was expected to carefully select materials for study and to guide the clerk in his study of the law to ensure that the material was being absorbed.Moline, Brian J.,Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 781 The student was supposed to compile his notes of his reading of the law into a \\"commonplace book\\", which he would endeavor to memorize.Id. at 782. Although those were the ideals, in reality the clerks were often overworked and rarely were able to study the law individually as expected. They were often employed to tedious tasks, such as making handwritten copies of documents. Finding sufficient legal texts was also a seriously debilitating issue, and there was no standardization in the books assigned to the clerk trainees because they were assigned by their mentor, whose opinion of the law may be different greatly from his peers.Id. at 782 and 783. One famous attorney in the United States, William Livingston, stated in 1745 in a New York newspaper that the clerkship program was severely flawed, and that most mentors \\"have no manner of concern for their clerk's future welfare… [T]is a monstrous absurdity to suppose, that the law is to be learnt by a perpetual copying of precedents.\\" There were some few mentors that were dedicated to the service, and because of their rarity, they became so sought after that the first law schools evolved from the offices of some of these attorneys who took on many clerks and began to spend more time training than practicing law.id at 782. It was seen over the years that the apprenticeship program was not capable of producing lawyers capable of serving their clients.Sonsteng, John O., \\"A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century\\" . William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2007 (Revised April 2, 2008); page 13. The apprenticeship programs often employed the trainee with menial tasks, and while they were well trained in the day-to-day operations of a law office, they were generally unprepared practitioners or legal reasoners.Id. at 14. The establishment of formal faculties of law in U.S. universities did not occur until the latter part of the 18th century.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 442. The first law degree granted by a U.S. university was a Bachelor of Law in 1793 by the College of William & Mary, which was abbreviated L.B.; Harvard University was the first university to use the LL.B. abbreviation in the United States.Marion R. Kirkwood and William B. Owens, A Brief History of the Stanford Law School, 1893-1946 , Stanford University School of Law. The first university law programs in the United States, such as that of the University of Maryland established in 1812, included much theoretical and philosophical study, including works such as the Bible, Cicero, Seneca, Aristotle, Adam Smith, Montesquieu and Grotius.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 794. It has been said that the early university law schools of the early 19th century seemed to be preparing students for careers as statesmen rather than as lawyers.Id. at 795. At the LL.B. programs in the early 1900s at Stanford University and Yale continued to include \\"cultural study,\\" which consisted of courses in languages, mathematics and economics.Marion R. Kirkwood and William B. Owens, A Brief History of the Stanford Law School, 1893-1946 , Stanford University School of Law; page 19. In the 1850s there were many proprietary schools which originated from a practitioner taking on multiple apprentices and establishing a school and which provided a practical legal education, as opposed to the one offered in the universities which offered an education in the theory, history and philosophy of law.Sonsteng, John O., A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century. William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, 2007 (Revised April 2, 2008); page 15 The universities assumed that the acquisition of skills would happen in practice, while the proprietary schools concentrated on the practical skills during education.idem. In part to compete with the small professional law schools, there began a great change in U.S. university legal education. For a short time beginning in 1826 Yale began to offer a complete \\"practitioners' course\\" which lasted two years and included practical courses, such as pleading drafting.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 798. U.S. Supreme Court justice Joseph Story started the spirit of change in legal education at Harvard when, as a lecturer there in the early 19th century, he advocated a more \\"scientific study\\" of the law.Id. at 800. Therefore, at Harvard the education was much of a trade school type of approach to legal education, contrary to the more liberal arts education advocated by Blackstone at Oxford and Jefferson at William and Mary.Id. at 801. Nonetheless there continued to be debate among educators over whether legal education should be more vocational, as at the private law schools, or through a rigorous scientific method, such as that developed by Story and Langdell.Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); page 445.For detailed discussions of the development of Langdell's method, see LaPiana, William P., Logic and Experience: The Origin of Modern American Legal Education, Oxford University Press (New York, 1994); and Stein, Ralph Michael, The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction, Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429 (1981); pages 449-450. In the words of Dorsey Ellis, \\"Langdell viewed law as a science and the law library as the laboratory, with the cases providing the basis for learning those 'principles or doctrines' of which 'law, considered as a science, consists.'\\"Dorsey D. Ellis, Jr., Legal Education: A Perspective on the Last 130 Years of American Legal Training, 6 Wash. U.J.L. & Pol'y 157, 166 (2001). Nonetheless, into the year 1900 most states did not require a university education (although an apprenticeship was often required) and most practitioners had not attended any law school or college.Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 801. Therefore, the modern legal education system in the U.S. is a combination of teaching law as a science and a practical skill,Moline, Brian J., Early American Legal Education, 42 Washburn Law Journal 775 (2003); page 802. implementing elements such as clinical training,SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017). which has become an essential part of legal education in the U.S. and in the J.D. program of study.Sonsteng, John O., \\"A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century\\" .

Whereas in the 18th and 19th century, few U.S. lawyers trained in an apprenticeship \\"achieved a level of competence necessary to adequately serve their clients,\\" today as a result of the development of the U.S. legal education system, \\"law graduates perceive themselves to be prepared upon graduation\\" for the practice of law.Id. at 9 and 13. FacultyAALS Faculty Recruitment Conference= About half of the faculty hired by law schools in the United States result from interviews conducted at the annual AALS Faculty Recruitment Conference at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Academic degrees  Legal education is typically received through a law school program. The professional degree granted by U.S. law schools is the Juris Doctor (J.D.). Prospective lawyers who have been awarded the J.D. (or other appropriate credential), must fulfill additional, state- specific requirements in order to gain admission to the bar in the United States. The Juris Doctor (J.D.), like the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), is a professional doctorate. The American Bar Association issued a Council Statement that the JD is equivalent to the PhD for educational employment purposes.http://www.abanet.org/legaled/accreditation/Council%20Statements.pdf The Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) (\\"Scientiae Juridicae Doctor\\" in Latin), and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are research and academic- based doctorate level degrees. In the U.S., the Legum Doctor is only awarded as an honorary degree. As of July 2012, Yale Law School offers a Ph.D. in Law designed for students who have already earned a J.D. and who wish to pursue extended legal scholarship. Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a Juris Doctor (J.D.), often seek to obtain a Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.), or a Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.).  Admission to the bar  Please see Admission to the bar in the United States. Depending upon their state, attorneys must also satisfy Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit requirements.  Lawyer credentials, prestige, and career path  American law firms are often very credential-oriented. Apart from the minimum requirements of a J.D. and admission to the state bar, there are certain credentials recognized within the profession to distinguish lawyers from one another; those credentials are almost always mentioned in lawyer profiles and biographies, which are used to communicate to both fellow attorneys and prospective clients. Chief among them are such honors as being a member of their law school's law review, moot court, or mock trial programs. Judicial clerkships after graduation or law clerk positions at prestigious law firms while in school are also distinguishing marks. This credential-based system is sown in law school, where high grades are frequently rewarded with law review membership and much sought after summer clerkships (called \\"summer associateships\\" in some areas) with large private law firms. These programs are designed to give a firm's summer associates an idea of what the everyday practice of law is like at that particular firm by allowing them to work with the firm's partners and associates on real projects involving real clients. In larger cities, such as New York or Chicago, summer associates at large firms can make as much as $3,000 per week.See http://www.alreadybored.com for current salaries for summer associates. Competition to receive a summer offer from a firm is intense, and credentials (a student's GPA and class rank, law review or moot court membership, publications, etc.) play a decisive role in determining who is selected. Most offers are received after a three-step interview process. First, during the early fall of their 2L (second year), students at each law school first submit their resumes to a central paper file or online database (such as CRIS or LexisNexis Martindale-HubbellJulia Gray Smith, \\"Martindale Purchases Struggling eAttorney\\", Daily Report), from which interviewers selected candidates they wish to interview, based almost entirely on their 1L GPA and class rank. Second, selected students are notified, usually via email, and then schedule a screening interview, either at the law school or at a local hotel; this interview is usually conducted by one or more attorneys from that firm and is part of most schools' On Campus Interview (\\"OCI\\") program, in which firms send recruiters to schools across the country. Finally, students selected from the screening interviews are invited for a final \\"callback\\" interview, commonly held at the firm's offices. If the selected student attends school in a place far from the city in which the firm is located, it is not unusual for the firm to fly the student in and pay for accommodations while they are in town. After the callback, a selected candidate will receive a phone call (usually within 48 hours) informing them that they have been extended an offer. After the summer, early into their 3L (third) years, the vast majority of summer associates receive formal offers to join the firm after graduating school and sitting for the bar exam. = Law school rankings = The US News and World Report publishes the most well-known annual ranking of American programs, where Yale Law School has held the #1 spot every year since the inception of the ranking reports. A number of alternative rankings exist, such as the Leiter Reports Law School Rankings. These rankings divide law schools into \\"tiers\\" based on the overall quality of each program. A number of factors and statistics are compiled to produce these rankings each year, including academic reputation, the quality of the faculty (usually measured by the quality of its publications), the quality of the student body (usually measured by average Law School Admission Test, or LSAT, score and undergraduate grade point average), the number of volumes in the library, the earnings potential of graduates, bar passage rates, and job placement rates. Most of these measurements are acquired by voluntary self- reporting from each law program; others are compiled through a formal process of polling judges, legal professionals, recent graduates, law professors, and school administrators. The issuance of press releases that dismiss the rankings has become a yearly ritual for many law programs, but all but a handful cooperate in gathering and reporting statistics to the various ranking publications. First tier There are approximately 200 ABA approved law schools in the United States. There is no universally accepted ranking system, but many have attempted to divide law schools into \\"tiers\\" consisting of quartiles (50 law schools each) or perhaps eighths (25 law schools each), or have separated out the top 10 or top 20 law schools by U.S. News rank or median LSAT score. After the JD, a large study of law graduates who passed the bar examination (but were not necessarily practicing law), found that graduates of the top 10 law schools by median LSAT score of incoming classes typically earned incomes exceeding $170,000 within 12 years after graduation.After the JDIII https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10659607After the JII Graduates of the next 10 law schools earned around $158,000, and graduates of schools ranked 21-50 typically earned more than $130,000. Another peer reviewed study found that Law graduates at the 75th percentile of earnings ability typically earned around $80,000 more every year than they would have earned with only a bachelor's degree. Law graduate earnings typically continue to grow and do not peak until their mid 50s; thus graduates of top tier law schools can likely peak at incomes exceeding $250,000 per year. Though the specific rankings change from year to year, the overall composition of the top schools has remained fairly constant. Most legal professionals (judges, practitioners, or professors) rank the University of Chicago, Columbia, Harvard, NYU, Stanford, and Yale in the top echelon of American law schools, with Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and Stanford Law School being considered the most prestigious and the most selective schools to gain admission as measured by reputation scores from U.S. News surveys and admissions rate. In recent years, many people have used the concept of the T14 (the top 14) to define the top tier of law schools. These schools have consistently ranked in the top 14 in the annual US News ranking of law schools. The T14 is composed of the schools listed above and also Berkeley (Boalt Hall), Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, Michigan, Northwestern, University of Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The most prestigious and sought- after law jobs in the country—U.S. Supreme Court Clerks, legal faculty, Bristow Fellows, Office of Legal Counsel Lawyers, Assistant U.S. Attorneys in cities like New York and Chicago—are more likely to be awarded to students and graduates in one of these programs. Recruiters from elite law firms visit top- tier law schools each fall to recruit new associates for the following summer. In contrast, small and mid-market law firms -- which make up the bulk of law firms in the U.S. -- cannot predict their labor needs that far in advance, and most new law school graduates who do not graduate from top tier law schools therefore must seek out jobs at law firms during their third year or even after graduation.  Lower tiers  The majority of law school students do not end up at an elite university, but many can, and often do, find well- paying jobs in law firms, government, or business positions. After the JD, a large study of law graduates who passed the bar examination (but were not necessarily practicing law), found that even graduates of lower ranked law schools were typically making six figure ($100,000+) incomes within 12 years after graduation., although graduates of higher ranking schools typically earned more. The Economic Value of a Law Degree, a peer reviewed study which included law graduates who do not pass the bar exam, found that law graduates at the 25th percentile of earnings ability typically earned around $20,000 more every year than they would have earned with only a bachelor's degree, compared to around $80,000 more per year for those at the 75th percentile. = Regional tiers = Most law schools outside the top tier are more regional in scope and often have very strong regional connections to these post-graduation opportunities. For example, a student graduating from a lower-tier law school may find opportunities in that school's \\"home market\\": the legal market containing many of that school's alumni, where most of the school's networking and career development energies are focused. In contrast, an upper-tier law school may be limited in terms of employment opportunities to the broad geographic region that the law school feeds. = State accredited schools = Some schools are accredited by state governments. They are located in Alabama, California, Massachusetts, and Tennessee. Some state authorized law schools are maintained to offer a non-ABA option eliminating costly ABA requirements seen as unnecessary by many of these states.  Unaccredited schools  Many schools are not accredited by a state or the American Bar Association. Most are located in California. While graduates of these schools may apply for admission to the California State Bar, they may not necessarily be allowed to apply for admission in other states. =Law school activities and honors= Within each U.S. law school, students may receive additional credentials. These include: * Law review/Law journal membership or editorial position (based either on grades or write-on competition or both). This is important for at least three reasons. First, because membership is determined by either grades or writing ability, it is an indicator of strong academic performance. This leads to the second reason: potential employers sometimes use law review membership in their hiring criteria. Third, work on law review exposes a student to legal scholarship and editing, and often allows the student to publish a significant piece of legal scholarship on his or her own. Most law schools have a \\"flagship\\" journal usually called \\"School name Law Review\\" (e.g., the Harvard Law Review) or \\"School name Law Journal\\" (e.g., the Yale Law Journal) that publishes articles on all areas of law, and one or more other specialty law journals that publish articles concerning only a particular area of the law (for example, the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology). * Moot court membership or award (based on oral and written argument). Success in moot court can distinguish one as an outstanding oral advocate or appellate brief writer and can provide a degree of practical legal training often absent from law review membership. Membership in moot court and related activities, such as Dispute Resolution, may appeal especially to employers hiring for specialized litigation positions. * Mock trial/trial advocacy membership or award, based on oral advocacy in mock trial competitions. Mock trial honors often have special appeal to litigation- oriented offices, such as a district attorney's office, attorney general's office, public defender's office, or private firms that specializes in trial litigation. Mock trial is especially useful at assisting students with public speaking, allowing them to master the rules of evidence, and gain experience in writing opening statements, direct examination, cross examinations, and closing statements. * Order of the Coif membership (based on grade point average). This is often coupled with Latin honors (summa and magna cum laude, though often not cum laude). A slight majority of law schools in the United States do not have Order of the Coif chapters.  Court clerkships  On the basis of these credentials, as well as favorable faculty recommendations and other connections, some students become law clerks with judges after graduation, signing on for one or two-year clerkships. Clerkships may be with state or federal judges. There is a generally recognized hierarchy with regard to clerkships (federal clerkships are considered more prestigious than state court clerkships, and appellate court clerkships are considered more prestigious than trial court clerkships, with United States Supreme Court clerkships considered the most prestigious). The benefit to the lawyer from clerkships is experience working for a judge. Often, clerks engage in significant legal research and writing for the judge, writing memos to assist a judge in coming to a legal conclusion in some cases, and writing drafts of opinions based on the judge's decisions. Appellate court clerkships, although generally more prestigious, do not necessarily give one a great deal of practical experience in the day-to-day life of a lawyer in private practice. The average litigator might get much more out of a clerkship at the trial court level, where they will be learning about motions practices, dealing with lawyers, and generally learning how a trial court works on the inside. What a lawyer might lose in prestige they might gain in experience. By and large, though, clerkships provide other valuable assets to a new lawyer. Judges often become mentors to their clerks, providing the attorney with an experienced individual to whom they can go for advice. Fellow clerks can also become lifelong friends and/or professional connections. Those contemplating academia do well to obtain an appellate court clerkship at the federal level, since those clerkships provide a great opportunity to think at a very high level about the law. Hierarchies aside, clerkships are great experiences for the new lawyers, and law schools encourage graduates to engage in a clerkship to broaden their professional experiences.  United States Supreme Court clerkships  Some law school graduates are able to clerk for one of the Justices on the Supreme Court. Each Justice takes 4 clerks per year. Almost without exception, these clerks are graduates of elite law schools (with Harvard, Yale, and the University of Chicago being the most highly represented schools) who have already clerked for at least one year with highly selective federal circuit court judges (such as Judges Merrick Garland, Alex Kozinski, Harvie Wilkinson, David Tatel, Richard Posner). It is perhaps the most highly selective and prestigious position a recently graduated lawyer can have, and Supreme Court clerks are often highly sought after by law firms, the government, and law schools. The vast majority of Supreme Court clerks either become academics at elite law schools, enter private practice as appellate attorneys, or take highly selective government positions.  Criticism  Law school normally consists of only a classroom setting, unlike training in other professions. (For example, medical school in the United States is traditionally two years of class environment and two years of \\"rotations\\", or an apprenticeship-type hands-on experience.) Although some countries such as Germany and France require apprenticeship with a practicing attorney, this is not required in any United States jurisdiction. Because of this, many law students graduate with a grasp of the legal doctrines necessary to pass the bar exam, but with no actual hands-on experience or knowledge of the day-to- day practice of law. The American Bar Association called for American law schools to move towards a practice-based approach in the MacCrate Report. Many law schools have started to supplement classroom education with practical experience. Externship programs allow students to receive academic credit for unpaid work with a judge, government agency, or community legal services office. Several law schools also have law clinic programs in which students counsel actual clients under the supervision of a professor, such as University of Massachusetts School of Law. City University of New York School of Law and Florida Coastal School of Law are some of the few law schools that require student participation in law clinic courses. Similarly, Northeastern University School of Law and Savannah Law School use cooperative education to give their students law office work experience prior to graduation. Washington and Lee University School of Law has completely re-vamped its curriculum to require students to take practicum courses, externships, and clinics in the final year of law school to provide experience in preparation for practice. = Other issues = Large scale representative studies find that the overwhelming majority of lawyers are satisfied with their careers and their decisions to attend law school. Based on anecdotal evidence, some have claimed that high level of stress, a \\"culture of hours\\" and ethical issues common in the legal profession lead to a lower level of job satisfaction relative to many other careers.

Although the play has been seen as nonsense verse, it was also seen and celebrated at the time as a satire on Robert Walpole and Queen Caroline, wife of George II. The play is relatively short on the page, as it relies heavily upon its songs and theatrical effects for stage time. It concerns King Chrononhotonthologos and Queen Fadladinida of Queerummania who face an invasion by the Antipodeans (who are inverted people from the other side of the world). The king defeats the entire Antipodean army, leaving behind only the Antipodean king, who is taken to prison. The Queen sees the captive king, falls deeply in love, and mourns her virginity (for the king had never consummated their marriage). She prays to Cupid and Venus, and she gets her wish to lose her virginity and her husband. Chrononhotonthologos, in camp, takes offence at a piece of pork, slaps his general, and is killed by the raging general. The general creates a bloodbath before killing himself. The Queen is thus a widow maid and is free to marry the king's courtiers. The two courtiers take offense at her preference, and so she decides merely to pay them each night for their sexual services. The play ends thereupon with all well. An 1818 playbill from Nova Scotia for a performance of Chrononhotonthologos and other \\"old\\" plays. Parody The play is a parody of opera and of theatrical spectacle at the same time that it is itself a spectacular. The Antipodeans, who have their heads where their midsections should be, who walk upon their hands, etc., advance in columns (literally standing upon each other) rather than ranks, and the performance has a great dumbshow with them. The captured Antipodean king in his cell (the only Antipodean who would need to be in the stage foreground) was most likely a special effect himself, as he has no lines. The dances that are indicated throughout, several of which without apparent motivation, are similarly present simply for the effect on the senses. In general, the play burlesques the absurdity of operatic plots, as well as the most inexplicable habits of contemporary tragedy. Carey consistently undercuts the lofty expectations of the kingdom-in-crisis plot by having the feared enemy be the Antipodean (or Acrostic) and by having the characters travesty the repetitive verse of tragedy. When King Chrononhotonthologos visits General Bombardinian in his tent after single-handedly destroying the Antipodean army with a glare, the general orders, :\\"Traverse from Pole to Pole; sail round the World, :Bring every Eatable that can be eat: :The King shall eat, tho' all Mankind be starv'd.\\" (I v, 11–14) and then backtracks to announce that they only have pork. The King takes deadly offense at being offered pork, and so he slaps the general, and the general's heroic pride forces him to stab the king in return. When the general regrets his regicide, he calls out, in a parody of Richard III, :\\"Go, call a Coach, and let a Coach be call'd, :And let the Man that calls it be the Caller; :And, in his calling, let him nothing call, :But Coach! Coach! Coach! O for a Coach ye Gods!\\" When the doctor confirms the king's death, Bombardinian tells him to go to the next world and fetch the king's soul back (and stabs him), only to say to the air, in mock tragic grief, \\"Call'st thou Chrononhotonthologos?/ I come! your Faithful Bombardinian comes\\" and kills himself. If this arbitrary bloodbath (motivated by the king's hyperbolic vanity and the general's hyperbolic pride) is not enough of a deflation, when the Queen comes in to bewail her virginity, her lady simply says, \\"I'll fit you with a Husband in a Trice;/ Here's Rigdum Funnidos, a proper Man,/ If anyone can please a Queen, he can\\" (I. v 61–4). When Rigdum Funnidos's fellow courtier Aldiborontiphoscofornio, declares that he must be king or die, the queen replies, \\"Well, Gentlemen, to make the Matter easy,/ I'll have you both, and that, I hope will please ye.\\" Deciding at last that marriage is complicated (after her lady offers a formulaic complaint about marriage), the Queen concludes the play with, :\\"Gentlemen! I'm not for Marriage, :But, according to your Carriage, :As you both behave to Night, :You shall be paid to Morrow.\\" The parody of bad tragedy and inflated spectacular also occurs in the names involved . These tongue twisters are nonsense, but they are also parodies of the ignorantly contrived exotic names used by contemporary opera and tragedy. Where William Shakespeare and Thomas Otway had chosen foreign locations for their plays to mask the fact that they were commenting upon England, by the 1730s a strange-sounding foreign location was a generic expectation of tragedy. More important than the linguistic parody, however, is the parody in the characterization. King Chrononhotonthologos begins the play offended by sleeplessness, declaring, :\\"These Royal Eyes thou (Somnus) never more shall close. :Henceforth let no Man sleep, on Pain of Death: :Instead of Sleep, let pompous Pageantry, :And solemn Show, with sonorous Solemnity, :Keep all Mankind eternally awake. :Bid Harlequino decorate the Stage :With all Magnificence of Decoration....\\" (I. i. 63–7). The king's overblown greatness is such that those royal eyes are enough to destroy the entire enemy army. The queen orders about the sky and stars. The general demands that the entire earth be conquered so that the king might have a meal. This repeated hyperbole is pushed to the point of absurdity to create a burlesque of opera's impossible characters. On the one hand, these parodies are superficially delightful and satirically a relief from the bombast of hack-written and alloyed tragedy, but, on the other hand, they are part of a darker political satire taking place in the play. Political satire Henry Carey was a Tory, or an anti-Walpolean, and he identified with Alexander Pope, in particular, in his stance on the 18th century's cultural polemic (see Augustan poetry for the issues behind Ambrose Philips and Alexander Pope's poison pen battle). Pope had been a consistent enemy of Ambrose Philips's, and Philips was a stand-in for an entire slate of Whig political views. Attacking Philips was attacking what Philips stood for, and Carey achieved fame first by satirizing Philips's second set of odes (which had been dedicated to Robert Walpole) with his Namby Pamby. Namby Pamby had made Carey one of the darlings of the Tory opposition to Walpole. In 1728, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera had satirized Robert Walpole and opera, both, and it had proven enormously successful. However, Walpole had Gay's follow up, Polly, suppressed. Walpole's direct intervention in the stage prompted a new round of satires, including Chrononhotonthologos. However, Chrononhotonthologos is a far more dangerously political satire than Gay's The Beggar's Opera or Henry Fielding's Tom Thumb had been. Tom Thumb (1732) had introduced a parody of operatic plots and Walpole by focusing on a mythical kingdom where the queen would fall in love with an absurd character, but Carey goes much further by having the Queen fall in love with an absurd character and then walk away with two unrelated and unmotivated characters while, at the same time, having the king die due to vanity. The real life political events that are partially encoded in the play concern Caroline of Ansbach and George II. In the 1720s, George II, then Prince of Wales, had opposed his father bitterly and aligned himself with the Tory party, while his father fostered Robert Walpole (thanks to Walpole's playing up of suggestions that the Tories disapproved of the Hanoverian succession). Because of his fears of Jacobites, George I kept Walpole in power, while George II favored anyone else. George II's mistress, Mrs Howard, was a strong Tory and a woman who favored John Gay and others of the Tory wits. Toward the end of George I's life, Caroline of Ansbach attempted a reconciliation of father with son, and when George II came to the throne, she was the one who pushed for Robert Walpole. Mrs. Howard's influence was diminished to nothing, and George II, although still disliking his wife, did not involve himself in politics, leaving the field clear for her to continue to give power to Robert Walpole. John Gay had been promised patronage by Mrs. Howard, and that doomed his chances when George II became king, for it earned him the enmity of Queen Caroline. The friends and admirers of Gay (including Alexander Pope and Henry Carey) regarded this political game as a personal and moral betrayal. Chrononhotonthologos, therefore, is not innocent in its depiction of a queen who never makes love with her husband, a husband who has no idea about politics but only wishes to be flattered, and, most particularly, of a queen who falls in love with contrariness and takes two minor ministers as her competing gigolos. These political and topical allusions are not necessary for contemporary readers and viewers of the play. The nonsense verse and the immediate parody of opera are entertaining, but the political satire hidden beneath the frivolity was one component of the play's success. Context Chrononhotonthologos occupies a central position in the development of English nonsense verse. Carey's word play appears to exist for its own sake, and the sounds of words are one source of amusement. Additionally, like other nonsense verse, the writing plays with and parodies a well identified genre of high seriousness. The nonsense achieves part of its humor by fulfilling the structural and phonetic requirements of an extant form, but substituting silly syllables for meaningful ones, thereby allowing the listener or reader to enjoy the suggestion that the usual words are empty placeholders (e.g. when Jonathan Swift's King of Lilliput has a royal title ending in \\"Ully Mully Goo,\\" the nonsense sounds and weighs the same as the titles of real kings and, implicitly, is just as meaningful). Later authors, like Edward Lear, would cite Carey as a precursor. The characters' names in particular construct or perform an identity and build an expectation of character Performativity and an ongoing usage, thus Aldiborontiphoscofornio became Aldiborontiphoskyphorniostikos in an 1820s parlor game or referenced as Aldobrantifoscofornio in Norman Lindsay's The Magic Pudding (1910). The play is also one of the first examples of a parodic opera. Although The Dragon of Wantley would be more fully an opera, Chrononhotonthologos is a spectacular that is also an exaggeration of spectaculars. There had been farce spectacles before. In the era of the competing playhouses and the Restoration spectacular, the playhouses that had no capacity for special effects put on farces of the plays they could not stage. However, those plays had concentrated more specifically on effects than on the total experience of bombast, unmotivated dance, pompous music, and special effects, and Carey's play attacks not a specific rival, but an entire genre. Finally, in the context of Augustan drama, Carey's play contributed to the sentiment that led to the establishment of the Licensing Act of 1737, when the theaters would be subject to official censorship. After the successes of Tom Thumb and Chrononhotonthologos, theaters staged increasingly vicious attacks on the ministry. These satires were progressively more dangerously near an attack on the crown.

The qualifier is a string, allowing an authority to have different peer names for different services.Peer Name Resolution Protocol If a peer name is secure, the PNRP name records are signed by the publishing authority, and can be verified using its public key. Unsecured peer names can be published by anybody, without possible verification. Multiple entities can publish the same peer name. For example, if a peer name is associated with a group, any group member can publish addresses for the peer name. Peer names are published and resolved within a specified scope. The scope can be a local link, a site (e.g. a campus), or the whole Internet.  PNRP and Distributed Hash Tables  Internally, PNRP uses an architecture similar to distributed hash table systems such as Chord or Pastry. The peer name is hashed to produce a 128-bit peer identifier, and a DHT-like algorithm is used to retrieve the location of the host publishing that identifier. There are however some significant differences. DHT systems like Chord or Pastry store the indices of objects (hashes) at the node whose identifier is closest to the hash, and the routing algorithm is designed to find that node. In contrast, PNRP always store the hash on the node that publishes the identifier. A node will thus have as many entries in the routing system as the number of identifiers that it publishes. The PNRP design arguably trades increased security and robustness for higher routing cost. Most DHT systems assume that only one node publishes a specific index. In contrast, PNRP allows multiple hosts to publish the same name. The internal index is in fact composed of the 128-bit hash of the peer name and a 128-bit location identifier, derived from an IPv6 address of the node. PNRP does not use a routing table, but rather a cache of PNRP entries. New cache entries are acquired as a side effect of ongoing traffic. The cache maintenance algorithm ensures that each node maintains adequate knowledge of the \\"cloud\\". It is designed to ensure that the time to resolve a request varies as the logarithm of the size of the cloud.

In addition to being a writer, Connelly also appears as a presenter on radio and television shows. Overview Connelly's writing exhibits a self-deprecating humour and love of eccentricity that echoes the style of Bill Bryson. Similarly, he shares with several other writers a fascination with subject-matter that had not previously been a feature of traditional travel writing. Connelly began his career as a writer of books relating to sporting events, most commonly football. His breakthrough 2002 book, Stamping Grounds, was his fifth, and followed the Liechtenstein national football team in their unsuccessful campaign to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Connelly's 2004 follow-up, Attention All Shipping, which was his first to deviate from football as its topic, has been listed as a best- seller and selected as \\"Book of the Week\\" by the UK radio station BBC Radio 4. Attention All Shipping (2004) was Connelly's first book not to take football as its central subject: again seeking out unusual destinations, he travels to each area mentioned in the shipping forecast made famous on BBC Radio 4. In 2007, Connelly released his seventh book, In Search of Elvis, which again focused on travel and the impression left by entertainer Elvis Presley. Connelly's eighth book, And Did Those Feet: Walking Through 2000 Years Of British And Irish History, followed in 2008 in which Connelly undertook some notable journeys from history on foot and was again a BBC Radio 4 \\"Book of the Week\\", read by Martin Freeman. Our Man in Hibernia was published in 2010 and detailed his move to Ireland and his search for his Irish roots while his tenth book, Bring Me Sunshine, which examines the history of the weather and weather forecasting, appeared in September 2012. Bring Me Sunshine was also a Radio 4 \\"Book of the Week\\" read by the actor Stephen Mangan. On the Radcliffe and Maconie show on BBC 6 Music in December 2013 Bernard Sumner announced that he had engaged Connelly to co-write his autobiography. In 2016 Connelly collaborated with the twenty-times champion jockey Tony McCoy on his autobiography Winner: My Racing Life which was shortlisted for Autobiography of the Year at the 2016 British Sports Book Awards. Connelly's work has also appeared in the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, The Times, the Scotsman and the Herald. Since May 2017 he has been the literary correspondent of The New European. Connelly was also a presenter on the BBC 1 Holiday programme and has lectured at the Royal Geographical Society. He co-presented the first three series of the BBC Radio 4 programme Traveller's Tree with Fi Glover, has appeared on Excess Baggage and Loose Ends and has made documentaries for BBC Radio 4 on subjects ranging from the poetry of Noël Coward to the cricket coach Alfred Gover. In August 2008 Attention All Shipping was voted the second greatest audiobook in a public vote organised by The Guardian newspaper and Waterstone's bookshops, finishing behind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In October 2014 Connelly premiered a one-man show based on Attention All Shipping with a sold-out performance at the Cutty Sark Studio Theatre.

All interested registered promoters may bid on the amount of the purse (the total money that the fighters will be paid for the match), if the sides representing each fighter fail to agree on it before the deadline. The highest offer wins; however, the winning entity must produce a small percentage of the total amount up-front by a certain date. The purse in a purse bid is split between the fighters according to the preset formulas of the sanctioning commissions.http://wbcboxing.com/downloads/WBCRulesandRegulationsamendedandapproved13Dec2011.pdf Purse bids are often won by one of the two fighters' promoters. For championship belt fights under a given sanctioning body (WBC, WBA, WBO, IBF, etc), the two fighters' (champion and challenger) promoters/managers usually get together to establish an agreement for how much each side will receive. In situations where the two sides can't agree, it will sometimes go to a \\"purse bid\\" where the process is opened up to any promoter that would like to put on the fight. They submit bids for how much they're willing to pay in purses and the highest bidder wins the right to put on the fight. In such cases, the champion usually gets a higher percentage and the challenger a lower percentage and the total purse is simply split between the two by formula. For example, in the summer of 2015 the WBA heavyweight champion was Wladimir Klitschko and the WBA wanted him to fight his mandatory challenger, Tyson Fury. The two sides (K2 Promotions for Klitschko and Frank Warren for Fury) were initially unable to come to an agreement on terms for a fight. The WBA then ordered a purse bid, which would have allowed any promoter to submit bids to put the fight on themselves. Just before the purse bid was going to open up, the two sides announced they had come to an agreement and so the purse bid was canceled.

The regiment landed on Juno beach on D-Day, assigned to 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. In 1954, as a result of the Kennedy Report on the Reserve Army, this regiment was amalgamated with The Cape Breton Highlanders and The Pictou Highlanders to form 1st Battalion The Nova Scotia Highlanders. The North Nova Scotia Highlanders were allied to the South Staffordshire Regiment and were kitted with a blue glengarry with diced border, scarlet doublet, white sporran with five black points, scarlet & green hose, green garter flashes with full dress only for pipers and drummers. The regiment perpetuated the 25th, 106th & 193rd Battalions C.E.F and held its final Order of Precedence as 34. During the Second World War, Major Kurt Meyer of the Waffen SS murdered captured soldiers from the regiment. After the war he was tried and convicted in Canada. Sentenced to death on 28 December 1945, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on 14 January 1946.Brode, 106.

During the Second World War, The Pictou Highlanders were active in a defensive role but were never engaged in battle. Details of the regiment were raised for local protective duty on September 1, 1939 and full mobilization occurred on January 1, 1941. The first move that the regiment made was to Newfoundland for coastal defense duty from March until August 1943. In September of the year, one company was dispatched to Nassau, Bahamas where it performed garrison duty until March 1946. A second company entitled Special Infantry Company (Pictou Highlanders) was mobilized on September 10, 1942 for service in Bermuda from November 12, 1942 to April 1, 1946. Their duties performed, both the active battalion and the Special Infantry Company were disbanded on April 30, 1946. During the life of the active units, a 2nd Battalion also served in Canada in the Reserve Army.

His most famous work is the Isolario (The Book of Islands, \\"where we discuss about all islands of the world, with their ancient and modern names, histories, tales and way of living...\\") in which he describes all the islands of the known world with their folklore, myths, cultures, climates, situations, and history. Printed in Venice in 1528, the work is an example of a cartographic genre popular in Italy during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.Yale University Map Department It is intended as an illustrated guide for sailors and attempts to include all the new transatlantic discoveries. Isolario contains an oval depiction of the world, a type of map invented by Bordone Columbia University photo of Bordone's map and later formalized into the equal-area elliptical Mollweide projection three centuries later. Bordone's map shows a very distorted Mondo Novo (New World), displaying only the northern regions of South America. North America, depicted as a large island, is labeled Terra del Laboratore (Land of the worker), almost certainly a reference to the slave trading in the area in those days (and hence the name Labrador). The book also contains a record of Pizarro's conquest of Peru, the earliest known printed account of this event. Of particular interest in this work are numerous woodcut maps, twelve of which relate to America. One map displays a plan of \\"Temistitan\\" (Tenochtitlan, modern Mexico City) before its destruction by Cortez. Also of interest is a map of Ciampagu the earliest known European- printed map of Japan as an island. Bordone is reputed to have been the father of Julius Caesar Scaliger, a classical scholar, and grandfather of Joseph Justus Scaliger, founder of the science of historical chronology. Original maps from Bordone's Isolario are prized for their historical value.

After playing with several New York bands she began a solo career, recording several albums which had only modest sales despite enthusiastic reviews. She settled into a career of touring while raising a daughter, then formed a duo with Wreckless Eric whom she also married. As of November 2011 they continue to tour from a base in upstate New York. She is the author of a memoir, Girl to City.http://www.amyrigby.com/girl-to-city-a-memoir Biography Rigby was born in the Pittsburgh suburbs and raised Catholic. She moved to New York City in 1976. She married dB's drummer Will Rigby in the 1980s, and during the late 1980s and early 1990s recorded with New York bands such as The Shams and Last Roundup. She had a daughter with Rigby. In 1999 Rigby moved to Nashville to pursue a publishing deal, and continued to record and tour. Rigby met Eric Goulding, also known as Wreckless Eric, in Hull, England, where she was performing one of his songs, and they married. She later relocated to Cleveland Ohio, and in late 2006 she and Goulding moved to France. In the fall of 2011 they moved back to the USA, settling in a town in upstate New York. Rigby and Goulding collaborated on albums. She wrote a memoir of her path from Elton John fan in the suburbs of Pittsburgh to professional musician, Girl to City, that was published in July 2019. Music career Rigby released her first full-length recording under her own name, Diary of a Mod Housewife, in 1996. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau praised the album, calling it \\"concept album of the year\\". Spin voted Rigby \\"Songwriter of the Year\\" for 1996. Middlescence and The Sugar Tree (like Mod Housewife, recorded for Koch Records), also were well received by critics and listeners. Koch also released Rigby's compilation album, 18 Again. After leaving Koch, she recorded for the Signature Sounds label, and also sold live CD and DVD material through her website. Til The Wheels Fall Off, with its opening track, \\"Why Do I,\\" produced by Richard Barone, was released on Signature in 2003, and Little Fugitive in 2005. The weekly newspaper The Nashville Scene said that Little Fugitive \\"finds Rigby as sharp as ever, even as many of the songs evince the fuzz of dislocation...or the exasperation of a survivor who hasn't lost her sense of humor but knows that jokes have their limits.\\" She writes lyrics about the trials of a cash-strapped single mother in an uncaring world. \\"The Good Girls\\" is a song about consumerism and underemployment, for example. Asked by her manager if she would not be able to write the same kind of songs after starting a happy relationship, she responded \\"No problem. I'm still poor\\", before cranking out a lyric about her beau's ex-wife. Another trademark is outrageous sexual humor, as in the songs \\"I Hate Every Bone in Her Body\\" and \\"Are We Ever Going to Have Sex Again?\\" Rigby uses basic chord structures derived from '60s rock and pop music. Her records are as notable for their musical sophistication as for their lyrical directness. Her influences also include New York City punk rock, especially as played at the famous CBGB club, as well as the Beatles and other mid-1960s pop. One of her recent songs is entitled \\"Dancing With Joey Ramone.\\" Ronnie Spector, Sara Hickman, and Laura Cantrell have recorded compositions by Rigby.

The native English speakers in Quebec generally align to Standard Canadian English, one of the largest and most relatively homogeneous dialects in North America. This standard English accent is common in Montreal, where the vast majority of Quebec's native English speakers live. English-speaking Montrealers have, however, established ethnic groups that retain certain lexical features: Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities that all speak discernible varieties of English. Isolated fishing villages on the Basse-Côte-Nord of Quebec speak Newfoundland English, and many Gaspesian English-speakers use Maritime English. Francophone speakers of Quebec (including Montreal) also have their own second-language English that incorporates French accent features, vocabulary, etc. Finally, the Kahnawake Mohawks of south shore Montreal and the Cree and Inuit of Northern Quebec speak English with their own distinctive accents, usage, and expressions from their indigenous languages. Quebec Anglophone English The following are native-English (anglophone) phenomena unique to Quebec, particularly studied in Montreal English and spoken by the Quebec Anglophone minority in the Montreal area. Before the 1970s, minority-language English had the status of a co-official language in Quebec. =Phonology= Anglophone Montreal speaks Standard Canadian English, which has the Canadian Vowel Shift and Canadian raising, with some additional features: *Resistance to the merry–marry merger: unlike the rest of typical North American English, Montreal English tends to maintain the distinction in words like Mary/merry versus marry, perish versus parish, and Erin versus Aaron. The vowels remain, as in traditional East-Coast American English and often British English, and , respectively. *The vowel is relatively backed. *The \\"short a\\" or vowel is not raised before as elsewhere in Canada, but it is raised somewhat before for ethnic British and Irish Montrealers. Among other ethnicities, such as Jewish Montrealers, there may be no raising of the vowel in any context. *The following vowel sounds are linguistically-conservative: the sets of vowels represented by the words (back and monophthongal), (monophthongal), and (back). =Vocabulary= Quebec English is heavily influenced by English and French the phrases / words below shows the variation of meaning among the Quebec English dialect. Delay: an amount of time given before a deadline. \\"I was given a delay of 2 weeks before my project was due\\". An Animator: is not an artist but is someone who meets and entertains children. In most of Canada, a sweet carbonated beverage is commonly referred to as a \\"pop,\\" but in Montreal, it is a \\"soda\\" or \\"soft drink.\\" The phrase \\"in hospital\\" is often replaced by \\"in the hospital.\\" A Formation - this word in English would normally mean a routine stance used in a professional formation. (i.e. The men stood in formation ) in Quebec a Formation is a reference to an education. A Pass - this phrase originates from Italian speakers, the phrase \\"Pass\\" is often used in phrase such as I am going to pass by a friend on the way to the movies. The phrase is comparatively used when already your already completing one action but can squeeze in another action on the way to your destination. In standard English this phrase \\"Your Bus will pass in 2 minutes\\" would mean that your are about to miss your bus or that you have already missed your bus. Alternatively in Montreal the phrase \\"Pass\\" can also mean to arrive or stop as a way to show that the action will happen in a relatively short time frame. Example: \\"Your bus will pass in 2 minutes\\". Locations within the city are also commonly described using syntax borrowed from French. If a building is at the corner of St. Catherine and Peel streets in downtown Montreal, it may be described as being “on St. Catherine, corner Peel.” This is parallel to the French expression, “Ste. Catherine, coin Peel,” or “angle Peel.” =French-language toponyms= English-speakers commonly use French-language toponyms and official names for local institutions and organizations with no official English names. The names are pronounced as in French, especially in broadcast media. Examples include the Régie du logement, the Collège de Maisonneuve, Québec Solidaire, the Parti québécois, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and Trois-Rivières. Pie-IX (as in the boulevard, bridge and subway station) is pronounced or . On the other hand, a final written consonant may be included or added in pronunciation if a historic English-language name and pronunciation exists among Anglophone or English-dominant Allophone communities that are associated with particularly neighbourhoods. Examples are \\"Bernard Street,\\" which in French is known as rue Bernard. Montreal is always pronounced [ˌmɐntʃɹiˈɒl], following its historic official English-language name, but Quebec is pronounced or sometimes . English-speakers generally pronounce the French Saint- (m.) and Sainte- (f.) in street and place names as the English word \\"saint\\"; however, Saint-Laurent (the former city, now a borough of Montreal) can be pronounced as in Quebec French , but Saint Lawrence Boulevard can be said as Saint-Laurent (silent t) or as the original English name, Saint Lawrence. Sainte-Foy is pronounced . Saint-Denis is often pronounced , or . Verdun, as a place name, has the expected English-language pronunciation, , but English-speakers from Verdun traditionally pronounce the eponymous street name as . Saint-Léonard, a borough of Montreal, is pronounced \\"Saint-Lee-o-nard\\" , which is neither English nor French. Some French-language place names are very difficult for English speakers to say without adopting a French accent, such as Vaudreuil, Belœil, and Longueuil in which pronunciation of the segment (spelled \\"euil\\" or \\"œil\\") is a challenge and so most often pronounced as , and or less often . Used by both Quebec-born and outside English-speakers, acronyms with the letters pronounced in English, not French, rather than the full name for Quebec institutions and some areas on Montreal Island are common, particularly if the English-language names are or were official. For instance, SQ → Sûreté du Québec (pre-Bill 101: QPP → Quebec Provincial Police, as it once was); NDG → Notre-Dame-de-Grâce; DDO → Dollard-des-Ormeaux; TMR → Town of Mount Royal, the bilingual town's official English name. *English toponyms in place of French (nonstandard whenwhen written): Older generations of English-speaking Montrealers are more likely to informally use traditional English toponyms that vary from official, French-language toponyms. In a notable generational distinction, it is uncommon among younger English-speaking Quebecers. Examples include Pine Avenue, Park Avenue, Mountain Street, Dorchester Blvd., St. James Street – often used without St., Blvd., Ave., Rd., etc. (names for the designations \\"avenue des Pins\\", \\"av. du Parc\\", \\"rue de la Montagne\\", \\"boulevard René-Lévesque\\", \\"rue St-Jacques\\"; the English-language official designations have reputedly been revoked, but evidence for that is difficult to find); Guy and Saint Catherine Streets; Town of Mount Royal, as it was chartered, and the charter has not been revoked; and Pointe Claire (English pronunciation and typography, instead of official \\"Pointe-Claire\\" with French accent). =French loanwords= The use of a limited number of Quebec French terms for everyday place nouns (and occasional items) that have English equivalents; all of them are pronounced with English pronunciations or have undergone English clippings or abbreviations and so are regarded as ordinary English terms by Quebecers. Some of them tend sometimes to be preceded by the in contexts for which they could normally take a/an. :autoroute instead of expressway :branché instead of trendy (colloquial) :chansonnier instead of songwriterhttps://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jacques-parizeau-obit :chez nous instead of \\"[at] our place\\" :the dep – instead of corner, variety, or convenience store; from dépanneur :coordinates instead of contact information :fonctionnaire or instead of civil servant :formation instead of traininghttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/53339102e4b00c509597c34c/t/5a0c5332e4966b4ad9f90f1a/1510757184029/MTL_ANG_Dec_2017_v6.pdf :the gallery – instead of balcony :the guichet – instead of bank machine, even when all ATMs are labelled \\"ATM\\"; :malaise - instead of malady or ailmenthttps://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/leading-montreal-aids- researcher-mark-wainberg-dies-in-florida :marché – market :the métro (or metro) instead of the subway; from the French chemin de fer métropolitain;https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/part-montreals- metro-system-down-again metro is used outside Canada, though, as in the Washington metro :nappe – a tablecloth :poutine – French fries with gravy and cheddar cheese curds :primary one, two, three, in contrast to Canadian English grade one, two, etc. :resto – restaurant :the SAQ – the official name of the government-run monopoly liquor stores (pronounced \\"ess-ay-cue\\" or \\"sack\\"), the Société des alcools du Québec. That usage is similar to that in other provinces, like in neighbouring Ontario, where LCBO liquor stores are referred to as the \\"lick-bo\\" (for Liquor Control Board of Ontario). :stage – apprenticeship or internship, pronounced as :subvention – government grant or subsidy. The word exists in both French and English, but it is rarely heard in Canadian English outside Quebec. :terrasse – the French pronunciation and spelling of the translation for 'terrace' is common among anglophones in casual speech and is considered acceptable in semiformal expression such as journalism.Chez Alexandre owner takes down terrasse to comply with city bylaw http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/chez-alexandre-owner-takes-down- terrasse-to-comply-with-city-bylaw-1.3060453 :undertaking – business or enterprise =Pronunciation of French names= The pronunciation of French- language first and last names uses mostly-French sounds may be mispronounced by speakers of other languages. For example, the pronounced \\"r\\" sound and the silent \\"d\\" of \\"Bouchard\\" may be both pronounced: . French-speakers and Quebec English-speakers are more likely to vary such pronunciations, depending on the manner in which they adopt an English phonological framework. That includes names like Mario Lemieux, Marie-Claire Blais, Jean Charest, Jean Chrétien, Robert Charlebois, and Céline Dion. Quebec Francophone English Francophone second-language speakers of English use an interlanguage with varying degrees, ranging from French-accented pronunciation to Quebec Anglophone English pronunciation. High-frequency second-language phenomena by francophones, allophones, and other non-native-speakers occur in the most basic structures of English, both in and outside of Quebec. Commonly called \\"Frenglish\\" or \\"franglais\\", such phenomena are a product of interlanguage, calques, or mistranslation and thus may not constitute so-called \\"Quebec English\\" to the extent that they can be conceived of separately, particularly since such phenomena are similar for Francophone-speakers of English throughout the world, which leaves little to be specific to Quebec. =Phonology= Francophones speaking English often pronounce / instead of /, and some also pronounce for the phoneme , and some mispronounce some words, some pronounce a full vowel instead of a schwa, such as for message. Since French-speakers greatly outnumber English-speakers in most regions of Quebec, it is more common to hear French in public. Some Anglophones in overwhelmingly- Francophone areas use some of the features (especially the replacement of and by [t] and [d]), but their English is remarkably similar to that of other varieties of English in Canada (Poplack, Walker, & Malcolmson 2006 Shana Poplack, James Walker & Rebecca Malcolmson (2006) An English \\"like no other\\"?: Language contact and change in Quebec. Canadian Journal of Linguistics. 185–213.). Other speakers There is also a pronunciation (NP) of the phoneme as /n/ + /ɡ/ (among some Italian Montrealers) or /n/ + /k/ (among some Jewish Montrealers, especially those who grew up speaking Yiddish), such as by high degrees of ethnic connectivity within, for instance, municipalities, boroughs, or neighbourhoods on Montreal Island, such as Saint-Léonard and Outremont/Côte-des-Neiges/Côte Saint-Luc. Such phenomena occur as well in other diaspora areas such as New York City. =Vocabulary and grammar= *The use of French collocations (NS): :Close the TV – Turn/shut off the TV. :Close the door. – Lock the door. :Open the light. – Turn on the lights. :Close the light. – Turn off the lights. :Take a decision. – Make a decision. (NB \\"Take\\" is the older British version. Compare French Prends/Prenez une décision) :Put your coat. – Put your coat on (from French Mets ton manteau/Mettez votre manteau). :Pass someone money. – Lend someone money. :Pass the vacuum. – Run the vacuum (or do the vacuuming) *The use of French grammar (NS): Many of these constructions are grammatically correct but only out of context. It is both the calquing and linguistic transfer from French and the betrayed meanings that make these sentences foreign to English. :He speak/talk to me yesterday. – He spoke/talked to me yesterday. (verb tense) :Me, I work in Laval. – I work in Laval. (vocal stress on \\"I\\". From French Moi, je travaille à Laval.) :It/He have many books. – There are many books. (from French il y a meaning \\"there is/are\\") :I like the beef and the red wine. – I like beef and red wine. (overuse of definite article to mean \\"in general\\". From French J'aime le bœuf et le vin rouge.) :You speak French? – Do you speak French? (absence of auxiliary verb; otherwise it means surprise, disbelief or disappointment when out of context) :We were/are four. – There were/are four of us. (from French \\"nous sommes\\" and \\"nous étions\\") :We're Tuesday – It's Tuesday. (from French \\"nous sommes\\") :I don't find my keys. – I can’t find my keys. (lack of English modal auxiliary verb) :At this moment I wash the dishes. – I’m washing the dishes right now. (verbal aspect) :I can't join you at this moment because I eat. – I can't join you right now because I'm eating. (verbal aspect) :My computer, he don’t work. – My computer won’t work. (human pronoun, subject repetition, uninflected auxiliary verb) :I would like a brownies. – Could I have a brownie? (plural –s thought to be part of the singular word in relexification process; other examples: \\"a Q-tips\\", \\"a pins\\", \\"a buns\\", \\"a Smarties\\", \\"a Doritos\\", etc.) :I would like shrimps with broccolis. – Could I have some shrimp and broccoli? (use of regular plural instead of English unmarked plural or non-count noun; this is not a case of hypercorrection but of language transfer). :Do you want to wash the dishes? – Will/would you wash the dishes? (lack of English modal verb; modal vouloir from French instead – Voulez-vous faire la vaisselle?) :We have to go in by downstairs – We have to go in downstairs (via the non-standard French 'entrer par') :You're going to broke it! – You're going to break it! (mixing of homonymic French tenses; \\"cassé\\", past, versus \\"casser\\", infinitive) *False cognates or faux-amis (NS): This practice is quite common, so much so that those who use them abundantly insist that the false cognate is the English term even outside of Quebec. Note that these French words are all pronounced using English sounds and harbour French meanings. While the possibilities are truly endless, this list provides only the most insidious false cognates found in Quebec. :a stage – an internship (pronounced as in French, from the French word for internship, \\"un stage\\".) :Cégep (cégep; collégial, cégepien) – the acronym of the public college network preceding university in Quebec. :Chinese pâté or – shepherd's pie (pâté chinois; Quebeckers' pâté chinois is similar to shepherd's-pie dishes associated with other cultures) :a cold plate – some cold-cuts (reversed gallicism – assiette de viandes froides) :coordinates – for address, phone number, e-mail, etc. :(a) salad – (a head of) lettuce :a subvention – a (government) grant :a parking – a parking lot/space :a location – a rental :a good placement – a good location :That's it. – That is correct. (from C'est ça.) :all-dressed pizza – a deluxe pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers (from pizza toute garnie.) :soup, two times – two soups, or two orders of soup (from \\"deux fois.\\") Few anglophone Quebeckers use many such false cognates, but most understand such high-frequency words and expressions. Some of these cognates are used by many francophones, and others by many allophones and anglophone accultured in allophone environments, of varying English proficiencies, from the bare-minimum level to native-speaker level.

While it is still in use today, its widest use was in the 1970s and 1980s. NOMAD supports both the relational and hierarchical database models. NOMAD provides both interactive and batch environments for data management and application development, including commands for database definition, data manipulation, and reporting. All components are accessible by and integrated through a database-oriented programming language. Unlike many tools for managing mainframe data, which are geared to the needs of professional programmers in MIS departments, NOMAD is particularly designed for (and sold to) application end-users in large corporations. End-users employ Nomad in batch production cycles and in Web-enabled applications, as well as for reporting and distribution via the web or PC desktop. Capabilities NOMAD is distinguished by five characteristics: *An intuitive database-oriented fourth- generation programming language (4GL) for creating databases, managing data, and writing applications *An interactive environment in which any 4GL statement may be typed and immediately processed (comparable to interactive tools like PHP or Perl) *Relational database features, supporting lookup tables and the other elements of a normalized relational database *Powerful set-at-a-time operations under the control of simple imperative commands *Accesses data from many sources, such as VSAM, IMS, IDMS, DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server. NOMAD's language was designed to simplify the application development process, especially for reporting applications. Where possible, common requirements were addressed by intuitive nonprocedural syntax elements, to avoid traditional programming. The heart of the system was the LIST command, which created report output. > > LIST BY STATE BY CUST_ID NAME PHONE ACROSS STATUS BALANCE WHERE STATE > AMONG('CT','NY') > > State Customer ID Name Phone Active Inactive > New > ----- ----------- ----------------- ------------ -------- -------- > --------- > CT 1001 ABC Co. 203-555-1212 1200 0 > 0 > 1012 DEF Co. 203-555-1313 0 50 > 900 > NY 1305 GHI Co. 212-555-1414 2650 0 > 0 > In this example, database fields STATE, CUST_ID, NAME, PHONE, STATUS, and BALANCE are laid out on a grid, with two sort breaks (via BY), generated columns based on data values (via ACROSS), and data selection (via WHERE). Additional keywords could control subtotals, titles, footers, table lookup, and myriad reporting details. The LIST command is somewhat analogous to the SQL SELECT statement, but incorporates formatting, totaling, and other elements helpful for tailoring output to a business requirement. The SELECT statement, in contrast, is essentially a data query tool: its results would be processed or formatted as required using other mechanisms. This distinction is highlighted by SQL's classification as a 'Data Sublanguage' (DSL): SQL is a powerful formalism for controlling data retrieval. The LIST command is a comprehensive report writer addressing broader functionality. Another example of NOMAD's power is illustrated by Nicholas Rawlings in his comments for the Computer History Museum about NCSS (see citation below). He reports that James Martin asked Rawlings for a NOMAD solution to a standard problem Martin called the Engineer's Problem: \\"give 6% raises to engineers whose job ratings had an average of 7 or better.\\" Martin provided a \\"dozen pages of COBOL, and then just a page or two of Mark IV, from Informatics.\\" Rawlings offered the following single statement, performing a set-at-a-time operation, to show how trivial this problem was with NOMAD: > > CHANGE ALL SALARY=SALARY*1.06 WHERE POSITION='ENG' AND > AVG(INSTANCE(RATING)) GE 7 Rawlings continues: \\"[Martin] decided to drop the idea [of showing alternative solutions to the problem]. [The NOMAD solution] was too unbelievable for him. He published his book in 1982 [sic: 1981], with many fine examples of NOMAD, most of which look silly today, for they don't reflect what NOMAD was really used for in the years since: serious, mission critical applications. I used Martin's Engineer's Problem in hundreds of NOMAD classes, as I forced people to think in terms of sets of data, instead of record-at-a-time, which is how they'd been taught.\\" Early development NOMAD was developed by National CSS, Inc., at the time in Stamford, Connecticut (later Wilton), by a small team launched in 1973. It was developed to supplant RAMIS, previously a major NCSS offering. The corporate view of NOMAD's importance at the time - and of tensions with the owners of RAMIS - can be deduced from the original NOMAD acronym: NCSS Owned, Maintained, And Developed. Unlike RAMIS, which was largely written in FORTRAN,The strength of VP/CSS was combining FORTRAN with Assembler NOMAD was written entirely in Assembler. Another RAMIS successor was FOCUS, which evolved in competition with NOMAD. These and other 4GL platforms such as Oracle competed for many of the same customers, all trying to solve end-user information problems without recourse to traditional 3GL programming. NOMAD was officially released in October 1975 (although customer usage began in May 1975). The NOMAD customer base expanded rapidly, as new categories of users adopted time-sharing data management tools to solve problems they previously could not tackle. NOMAD competed principally with Focus and Ramis for this expanding market. NOMAD was claimed to be the first commercial product to incorporate relational database concepts. This seems to be borne out by the launch dates of the well-known early RDBMS vendors, which first emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s - such as Oracle (1977), Informix (1980), and Unify (1980). The seminal non-commercial research project into RDBMS concepts was IBM System R, first installed at IBM locations in 1977. System R included and tested the original SQL implementation. The early RDBMS vendors were able to learn from numerous papers describing System R in the late 1970s and early 80s. NOMAD was released before these industry events, and thus, like System R, NOMAD drew on earlier academic work by relational database pioneers such as E. F. Codd. Early NOMAD development was in particular inspired by Christopher J. Date's influential An Introduction to Database Systems, itself first published in 1975. This book had technical ideas about the relational database model, and included a brief mention of SEQUEL (later SQL). Later editions of the book included NOMAD itself, and Date's approval of NOMAD's support of the relational database model. At the time, relational database concepts were new; most database systems utilized hierarchical, network, or other data models. Adding relational features to NOMAD's original hierarchical design was evidently a bold move for NCSS. Training materials, such as Daniel McCracken's book (cited below), focused on these relational database features, and their use in rapid application development. A simple methodology letting end-users design effective, normalized relational databases was soon added to the curriculum - and was later taught on campuses throughout the country, in the ACM Lectureship Series, by NCSS emeritus Lawrence Smith. NCSS can thus be seen as an early advocate of relational methods; but this position was soon eclipsed as SQL- based vendors burst onto the scene. Development: late 1970s NOMAD was the flagship NCSS product during the firm's years of rapid growth, going through a series of releases and receiving a major share of this (publicly traded) company's R&D;, sales, support, and other resources. NCSS and its time-sharing competitors primarily sold services to large corporations, at a time when most MIS departments were bogged down on huge COBOL implementation projects (see Brooks's famous The Mythical Man-Month for the contemporary mind-set). Because of development backlogs, outside services like NCSS became attractive. Tools like NOMAD made end-users self-sufficient: If they had discretionary budgets, and could get the necessary raw data from their MIS departments, then they could solve their own information problems. Many users were content to answer seemingly simple aggregate reporting questions that baffled the MIS departments of the day - like \\"rank departments by profitability.\\" Other end- users went beyond basic reporting to build large, mission-critical applications, either by learning the necessary skills, or by hiring their own technicians who didn't report through the MIS hierarchy. NCSS developed a large support infrastructure, including training, consulting, and other services, to foster end-user independence. (Dissatisfaction with traditional MIS methods and resources would later also fuel the personal computer revolution, which in turn would displace time-sharing vendors like NCSS.) [More citations are needed to illustrate: MIS departments of the 70s and 80s; the \\"Information Center\\" concept and end-user empowerment in the 80s; the timesharing industry and its role in enabling what became known as \\"Agile Companies\\" capable of using information as a competitive advantage. These topics were widely discussed in books and media of the day.] In the late 1970s, NCSS developed a 'mini-370' product called the NCSS 3200, primarily intended as an in-house platform for running NOMAD under the NCSS operating system VP/CSS (see below). The small, low-cost system was sold as an end-user 'database machine' or 'information warehouse' for extracting and analyzing corporate datasets - analogous to the dedicated mainframes installed at some of NCSS's larger customer sites. Despite limited success, the company lost interest in the 3200 venture, which was scrapped along with the VP/CSS operating system. Development: 1980s Until 1982, NOMAD was available only on NCSS's proprietary time-sharing system VP/CSS. During this period, with a few exceptions, NOMAD was used only by interactive time-sharing customers via pay-as-you-go dial-up access. NOMAD's primary status as a time-sharing product – rather than a licensed software product – had a major impact on its initial design, enhancement, sales, training, and support. The first NOMAD customers were inextricably linked to National CSS's service offerings, and to the capabilities of VP/CSS and the NCSS network. This changed, marking the start of a new era when NOMAD2 was developed in 1982 in conjunction with major customer Bank of America, It was released as a separate product under VM in 1982 and under MVS in 1983. It is still available today for the latest versions of z/VM and z/OS. In the late 1980s, NOMAD’s presence expanded to the PC when PC Nomad was released to run under DOS. Development: 1990 to Present NOMAD products continued to develop along multiple product lines in the 1990s with support for more sources of data and more operating systems. A new version of NOMAD for Microsoft Windows, Front & Center, was released in 1993. New versions of NOMAD for Unix and VAX were also released, with access to Oracle and SQL server data. Report Painter, a graphical user interface tool for writing reports, was added to the Front & Center product line. RP/Server was also released in the 1990s for accessing mainframe databases as remote databases from a variety of clients, including Report Painter, Front & Center applications, and DDE-enabled Microsoft Windows applications, such as Microsoft Excel. ODB/Server was introduced for transparent access to ODBC- compliant databases from Front & Center. On the mainframe front, NOMAD added double-byte character support and ran under the Fujitsu operating system. QLIST was added to the mainframe product line, providing a user-friendly environment for developing sophisticated reports without extensive knowledge of NOMAD syntax. NOMAD remains an extremely stable product that is enhanced to keep up with contemporary needs, such as access to Oracle and SQL Server data on mid-tier platforms, full e-mail support and additional types of output formatted in HTML, XML, and PDF. A new line of products began later in the 1990s, starting with RP/Web. This was the precursor to UltraQuest Applications, giving users the ability to Web-enable their mainframe NOMAD applications. The UltraQuest Reporter product was added to this line-up late in the 1990s, for easy reporting from the Web or from a PC of mainframe data via NOMAD. The experience gained from developing and supporting the QLIST and Report Painter products was applied to the development of UltraQuest Reporter. Their influence is clearly visible in UltraQuest Reporter, but Reporter uses Java and HTML technology to create a more user-friendly environment and provide more services. The basic philosophy of the NOMAD language, to simplify the application development and reporting processes with an intuitive and powerful syntax, is carried forward into the UltraQuest products. UltraQuest Reporter applies a layer on top of the 4GL to make report-building even easier, without writing any syntax at all, employing an intuitive and powerful graphical user interface. Other features and services make reporting applications and data securely available through the Web to any employee’s PC. Ownership Dun & Bradstreet acquired National CSS in 1979 and rebranded it as D&B; Computing Services or DBCS. In 1986 the NOMAD related assets of DBCS were sold to Must Software International of Norwalk, Connecticut (a wholly -owned subsidiary of Thomson-CSF) which became part of Thomson Software Products in 1995 and part of Aonix in 1996. NOMAD was sold and maintained by Select Business Solutions in Trumbull, Connecticut.Select Business Solutions User base When NOMAD was released as a licensed software product it was acquired by some of the large corporations that had been using the time- sharing service. These included Exxon and New York Telephone. (A few large users like Bank of America and Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), had previously negotiated site licenses for their own VP/CSS datacenters, most of which ran NOMAD. Most VP/CSS sites eventually migrated to the VM platform) Abbott Laboratories, American Express. Boeing, First Chicago Bank, IC Industries and Motorola were also customers. Other later customers who were new to the product included Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and Royal Insurance. With a limited client base came an opportunity for niche suppliers to provide independent application development and support. In the UK this market was filled by BSL International, RCMS, and Rex Software. RCMS became the UK vendors of NOMAD while BSL operated throughout Europe and the US. NOMAD continues to be used by large corporations and distributors, especially in the financial and health vertical markets.

It was released on October 1, 2004 in Europe and on April 6, 2005 in North America. Story Strange things are happening at Leafmore High. Three teenagers set out to search for their missing friend. Finding themselves locked inside the school overnight, they now have to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences. The player controls the five teenagers as they explore the school and battle a number of different types of infected students. The students discover that the enemies are sensitive to light, with direct sunlight being able to destroy them. Flashlights help to slightly weaken their foes and the malevolent black aura surrounding them. The students discover a conspiracy involving injections turning students into mutated monsters, mostly experimentations based on a rare plant spore, with the possibility to allow people to live forever. It is discovered that the nurse, Elisabeth, and principal, Herbert, are over 100 years old but seem only to be in their 60s, thanks to the tests they performed on each other. The students later come across Herbert, who is killed by a teacher seeking to cure himself of the infection caused by Herbert's experiments. Herbert's twin, Leonard, sees his dead brother and becomes angry. He murders the teacher and then leaves the teenagers to defeat the biggest mutant seen yet. After defeating him, they return to the gym and inject themselves with the cure. However, Leonard returns and after a battle, Leonard gives into the sunlight and everything is back to normal. =Player characters= Obscure gives players the ability to control and switch between any of five playable characters. As the player directly controls only one character at a time, the other characters will be computer-controlled, or a second player can join in at any time. * Josh Carter (voiced by Sam Riegel) - A shy and reserved reporter for the school paper. He can tell if there is anything left to do in an area, such as items to pick up, or locations that advance the storyline. * Stanley Jones (voiced by Scott Haze) - A stoner who does drugs, and is good friends with Josh and Kenny. He is a thief and computer hacker. He is able to pick locks easier and break into rooms. * Kenny Matthews (voiced by Liam O'Brien) - He is the varsity athlete, and Shannon's older brother. * Shannon Matthews (voiced by Stephanie Sheh) - Kenny's smart younger sister. Shannon dresses provocatively to take the focus away from her intelligence. She provides tips on puzzles and heals wounds. She is able to heal 20% more with a normal health item. * Ashley Thompson (voiced by Tara Platt) - She is a cheerleader, and Kenny's girlfriend. She has the ability to rapid fire a pistol, and deals more damage with most weapons. *Dan - He is a student and the first human Kenny comes across inside a room in the basement. His health is critically low due to being a test subject. He ends up being killed very quickly by a monster when he and Kenny attempt to escape together, and his death cannot be prevented. Gameplay Obscure has a two- player cooperative mode that allows the player to complete the campaign with a friend. The game also allows players to combine items, for example taping a flashlight to any firearm. Some critics, including X-Play, have stated that this was the only redeeming quality, and mocked id's Doom 3 for not implementing such a concept. While each character has special abilities, none of them are necessary to complete the game. Each character can perform the same physical acts even if it takes some characters longer and/or more effort than others. If any characters die during the adventure, the player may simply continue with those remaining. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Sequels and future Obscure II takes place two years later. The kids who survived are now at college living normal lives. They discover a strange plant on campus and things start going awry. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable. The franchise was abruptly halted due to the closure of Hydravision Entertainment, who had intended to do a sequel and possibly a prequel. However, Final Exam is a spinoff of the series and was released for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Microsoft Windows in 2013. In 2016, a high definition remaster of Obscure and its sequel was re-released on Steam featuring Steam achievements, leaderboards and community support. This version of Obscure removed music from Sum 41 due to the rights being lost.

The recipe of the Kyiv cake has changed with time: in the 1970s, bakers perfected the process of making egg-white and nut mixture, then started to add hazelnut in cake and began experimenting with peanuts and cashews.

Subordinate units 4th MAW consists of a wing headquarters, a wing headquarters squadron, four aviation groups, a wing support site unit, and two separate (i.e., not organic to a group) transport squadrons: * 4th Marine Aircraft Wing Headquarters (MAW HQ) * Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 4 * Marine Aircraft Group 41 - Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth * Marine Air Control Group 48 - Naval Station Great Lakes * Marine Aircraft Group 49 - Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst * Marine Aviation Training Support Group 42 - Naval Air Station Pensacola * 4th Marine Aircraft Wing Site Support - Marine Corps Air Station Miramar * Marine Transport Squadron Belle Chasse (VMR Belle Chasse) - Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans * Marine Transport Squadron Andrews (VMR Andrews) - Joint Base Andrews Structure 4th Marine Aircraft Wing History Prior to World War II, Marine Reserve aviation consisted of a few personnel operating obsolete aircraft under severe budgetary limitations. With the threat of war in Europe, a few reservists were activated, and by October 1940, many had been called to active duty. This handful of dedicated men helped build the Marine aviation force which cleared the skies and supported ground operations during World War II. =World War II= The 4th Marine Base Defense Aircraft Wing was commissioned August 22, 1942, at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa (MCAS Ewa), Hawaii. The Wing's three squadrons were located at Midway, Ewa and Samoa with the headquarters at MCAS Ewa. In the fall of 1944, the 4th Marine Base Defense Aircraft Wing became the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW). As the war progressed across the Pacific, 4th MAW pilots refined fighter bombing and low-altitude flying techniques that helped pave the way for today's MAGTF concept. =Post-WW II and Korea= 4th MAW was deactivated shortly after the war. On February 25, 1946, the Marine Air Reserve Training Command (MARTC) was established to preserve the skill of those Marines returning to civilian life. Headquarters for MARTC was located at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois. Post World War II foresight paid off in 1950 when the Korean War broke out. Having grown to a force of 6,035 men who trained at 25 Marine Air Detachments from coast to coast, the Marine Air Reserve was prepared for mobilization. Less than two weeks after mobilization day, July 23, 1950, three reserve fighter squadrons were on duty in Korea. Within the first seven weeks, the Marine Air Reserve furnished enough men to increase Marine fighter squadron strength in the Far East from two to six squadrons. Seven months later, more than 50 percent of the officers and 36 percent of the enlisted Marines in the 1st MAW were Reservists. The lessons and experiences of Korea helped expand and improve the entire reserve aviation program. In September 1953, Marine Air Detachments were redesignated as Marine Air Reserve Training Detachments (MARTDS). Most MARTDS were located aboard Naval Air Stations across the nation. =1960s - 1980s= The MARTC was reorganized in 1962 to include a Marine Aircraft Wing. This reorganization coincided with similar moves in the ground reserve, resulting in the division-wing concept for the entire Marine Corps reserve Program. The 4th MAW was brought back into being and the MARTC-4th MAW became a dual command. As turmoil developed in the Dominican Republic and U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia increased during the mid-1960s, the necessity of having a ready force in reserve became more apparent. Emphasis was shifted to the 4th MAW and in July 1966, a reorganization was undertaken to ensure that all units were prepared to execute the same missions and tasks as assigned in the regular Fleet Marine Force. In June 1974, 4th MAW/MARTC headquarters relocated to New Orleans. In October 1979, the MARTC was disbanded to organize the 4th MAW along the same lines as its active duty counterparts. =The Gulf War & the 1990s= During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, numerous units were mobilized and deployed to the Persian Gulf region. These units provided air support which contributed to the victory of allied forces.

As such it is easily mastered by non-programmers. A typical program - either to create or maintain a database or to create quite complex reports - would normally consist of a handful of lines of code which could be written or understood by non-professional programmers. \\"End users\\" as they became known. Such end users could be trained to use RAMIS in a matter of days and so large companies would often have several hundred such users scattered throughout the company. History RAMIS was initially developed in the mid 1960s by the company Mathematica on a consulting contract for a marketing study by a team headed by Gerald Cohen and subsequently further developed and marketed as a general purpose data management and analysis tool. In the late 1960s Cohen fell out with the management of Mathematica and left to form his own company. Shortly thereafter his new company released a new product called FOCUS which was very similar to RAMIS: \\"the same bugs and the same misspelled error messages.\\" National CSS (NCSS), a Time-sharing vendor, licensed rights to make RAMIS available on its VP/CSS system. At some point Mathematica changed its licensing price. The interested parties were: * NCSS, which was marketing RAMIS (and other products) for use on their time-sharing system * Mathematica, owner of RAMIS * Key developers/programmers of RAMIS ** some stayed with Mathematica ** others left to form the company that became Information Builders, known for their FOCUS product Most of the programming team remained with Mathematica as did almost all the sales force. By this time RAMIS had double digits of client companies in both the US and a European division headquartered in London and so Mathematica decided to create a new division called Mathematica Products Group and rename the product RAMIS II. At the same time, the company decided to recall Frank Fish - originally a Mathematica consultant who had been assigned to lead a European consulting team and had subsequently formed the European RAMIS group - to head up the RAMIS II design team and International Sales. Sales of both RAMIS II and FOCUS continued to grow through the 1980s throughout the western world with RAMIS II generally outselling FOCUS on mainframes though no detailed figures are available. RAMIS II was eventually installed in some 40 countries worldwide. =Purchased by Martin Marietta= Mathematica itself eventually grew to more than 500 staff with roughly 200 involved with RAMIS II.

La Chambre d'Echo saw the return of synthesizers and drum machines, while still focusing on chamber music-inspired darkwave music. John A. Rivers returned to produce the album alongside Anna-Varney Cantodea. An accompanying EP, Flowers in Formaldehyde, was released later that year. The album was introduced and promoted via a promotional video.Youtube, La Chambre d'Echo promo Overview La Chambre d'Echo was heavily inspired by Der Narrenturm, an old Austrian hospital and psychiatric ward that has since become a museum of diseases, mutations and abnormalities of the human body. As a result, the lyrical focus is that of hospitals and medical care in general. The album artwork, in part, features Cantodea transforming into a large worm-like creature, reminiscent of the artwork for Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar. The album featured prevalent use of synthesizers and drum machines, reflecting Sopor Aeternus' first album, Ich töte mich.... The packaging for La Chambre d'Echo is elaborate and extensive. The standard edition comes inside a 128-page, A4-sized book containing photography by Joachim Luetke, as well as handwritten lyrics provided by Cantodea. The photoshoot for the album was taken inside and around Der Narrenturm. The boxed set edition came in a linen-bound box and also included bookmarks, postcards, a translation guide and a pamphlet advertising Der Narrenturm; the included book was enclosed and sealed in an envelope. Curiously, the cover of the vinyl edition featured an image taken for the previous album, Es reiten die Toten so schnell (or \\"The Vampyre Sucking at His Own Vein'\\"). The vinyl edition features its own abridged version of the book as well as a poster. A postcard was included with the album, offering fans the chance to pre-order Flowers in Formaldehyde.

Richard & Son, commonly known as simply P.C. Richard, is the largest chain of private, family-owned appliance, television, electronics, and mattress stores in the United States. Its 66 stores are located in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, with the majority of the stores located on Long Island and in the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. The company is also known for its trademark whistle jingle created by Soundsmith worker Leer Leary. It is used by the New York Yankees after striking out an opposing batter at Yankee Stadium. History A P.C. Richard & Son store in Manchester, Connecticut, after replacing a former Circuit City store. In 1909, Pieter Christian Richard, who left Holland in 1899, opened a small hardware store in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn (“Work Well Done” 14). In October of that same year, P.C.’s son, Alfred J. Richard (A.J.), was born. Born into the business less than a month after it opened, A.J. played an important role from the beginning. He spent his childhood helping out at the store, only leaving it to go to school. When he completed ninth grade in 1923, A.J. decided to drop out of school and focus entirely on helping his family and building the business (“Work Well Done” 25). A.J. was responsible for introducing the first electric appliance to the inventory, the electric clothes iron, as well as time payments so his customers could afford them (“Work Well Done” 32). On February 1, 1947, A.J. officially took over as the company president and majority shareholder. It was around this time that he began to introduce his sons, Peter and Gary, to the family business (“Work Well Done” 58). Soon, the company grew into a chain as it expanded into Long Island. After the death of his father P.C. in 1972, A.J. promoted himself to chairman of the board in 1974, and he held that position until his death, well into his nineties. Peter and Gary were originally named co-presidents, but this arrangement changed in 1982, when Gary became president and Peter became executive vice president. Soon, Gary’s son Gregg began to work his way into the fabric of the company in the same way his father and grandfather had, until he became president in 2004. A.J. died weeks later at ninety-five years old. \\"The fourth generation, Gregg Richard, Bonni Rondinello and Peter Richard, III\\" are now involved in helping to run what their great-grandfather began.\\"four generations of family involvement\\" Growth and expansion P.C. Richard and Son expanded into New Jersey in 1993 (“Work Well Done” 111). Between 1995 and 2003, it opened fifteen new showrooms in New Jersey, Westchester County, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island (“Work Well Done” 127). In 2009, P.C. Richard and Son opened 6 new stores in former Circuit City locations, including its first in Connecticut. It continued to expand in Connecticut in 2010, opening stores in Milford, North Haven, Danbury, Newington, Manchester, and Enfield.P.C. Richard & Son New Stores , P.C.

Æthelhelm's mother was probably Wulfthryth.N. J. Higham, D. H. Hill, Edward the Elder: 899-924 (2013), p. 35 Some historians have suggested identifying him with the Æthelhelm who served as Ealdorman of Wiltshire, the probable father of Ælfflæd,Pauline Stafford, Queen Emma and Queen Edith, Blackwell, 2001, pp. 324–325; PASE s.v. who became Edward the Elder's second wife about 899. However, Barbara Yorke rejected this idea, arguing that it does not appear to have been the practice for æthelings (princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible to be king) to become ealdormen,Æthelwulf's son Æthelbald may have been an exception. According to Sean Miller, he was appointed an ealdorman in 850 (Sean Miller, Æthelbald, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004), but Simon Keynes suggests that the ætheling and the ealdorman were probably different people (Simon Keynes, Atlas of Attestations, Table XXI, S 301) that a grant from Alfred to Ealdorman Æthelhelm makes no reference to kinship between them, and that the hostile reception to King Eadwig's marriage to Ælfgifu, his third cousin once removed, shows that a marriage between Edward and his first cousin once removed would have been forbidden as incestuous. Yorke, op. cit., pp. 33–34. Keynes and Lapidge also treat the two Æthelhelms as different people, although they are more cautious in rejecting the identification, saying that they are \\"probably\\" not the same, p. 321, n. 66 On Alfred's death in 899 Æthelhelm's younger brother Æthelwold unsuccessfully contested the succession. He died in 902 at the Battle of the Holme. The historian Æthelweard (died c. 998) claimed descent from King Æthelred I and may therefore be a descendant of Æthelhelm. Some genealogists have suggested that the Godwins descended from Æthelred I through Æthelhelm, but almost all historians dismiss this idea.

He is a detective and crime-fighter, conceived by Ibn-e-Safi as the secondary focal character to assist the lead role of Colonel Ahmad Kamal Faridi.More details can be found in Faridi's portrait at official website of Mr. Ibne Safi. (See External links below: Ibne Safi's official website). CharacterPersonality= Hameed's character complements that of Faridi's. Hameed is playful, naughty, carefree, romantic, and when occasion calls for it, hardworking, brave, fearless, intelligent, and smart. Most of the time he acts like a child in front of Faridi and pretends to be a careless and messy character, frequently arguing with Faridi merely to irritate him. In his heart, however, he harbours a deep love for his boss. The fact that he is able to confront Faridi, not an easy thing to do, is evidence of his strong character. Often it is Hameed's seemingly impulsive actions that lead Faridi to victory. Hameed often jumps into action without thinking of the consequences, only to be surprised later on. Ibn-e-Safi calls this condition \\"khopri pe Chhipkali sawar hona\\", which literally means Hameed's mental apprehension by a lizard. The lizard is used metaphorically as an object that irritates someone in an extreme fashion. Several of Hameed's successes are a direct result of this phenomenon. =First Meeting with Faridi= The story of how Hameed met Faridi is related by Hameed to himself in \\"Thandi Aag\\" (The Cold Fire - #69). After returning from wartime, Hameed did not want to go back to his family. He saw Faridi at the airport and hugged him screaming \\"Bhai Jaan\\" (Dear Brother), while his father, who came to receive him, looked on in disbelief as Hameed completely refused to recognize him. Later on, after being convinced by Faridi, Hameed went back to his family and apologized for the joke he pulled on his father. =Background= \\"Thandi Aag\\", more importantly, explains how Hameed became as he is. Hameed's father was a traditionally- minded man who forced him to join the armed forces against his will. Hameed was consequently sent to war at a very young age. Seeing the horrendous aftermath of war led him to take comfort in the influence of alcohol. As the value of life diminished in his eyes and he started to ignore the importance of life, his carefree, somewhat irritated, and neglecting nature developed. After meeting Faridi, Hameed's philosophy on life changed dramatically to that which readers now know. =Personal life= In his early days, Hameed was involved with a girl named Shahnaaz. The affair lasted for a while to the point at which Hameed was almost ready to propose. However, it is clear to the reader that the lovers were not fully matured and were conflicted between the matters of heart and mind. Although it was necessary for the characters to go through such a mental evolutionary process, their nature meant that there could be no permanent rest. Hence, the character of Shahnaaz was removed. =Pets= Hameed is infamous for his pets that he trains himself. Some of these pets include a goat, a mouse, and a myna. The mouse first appears in \\"Khatarnaak Dushman\\" (The Dangerous Enemy #36). Hameed has trained her in such a way that she dances when he whistles. She has tiny bells wrapped around her legs (called \\"Ghunguroo\\" in Urdu/Hindi) that chime when she dances. Hameed loses the mouse in the underground world of Gerald Shashtri in \\"Jungle Ki Aag\\" (The Forest Fire #37), but finds her back in \\"Maut Ki Chataan\\" (The Rock of Death #41). The goat, Barkhurdaar Bughra Khan (which literally means \\"Son Goat Khan\\" - a sarcastic title), first appears in \\"Andheray Ka Shehenshah\\" (The Emperor of the Dark - #39). Hameed often takes \\"Bughra Khan\\" to restaurants and clubs, arguing that since women could come with their pet dogs, he should also be allowed with his pet goat. Of course, many restaurant and club owners would have a hard time accepting this reasoning since \\"Bughra Khan\\" often ends up with an uncontrolled urge to chew on furniture and table covers. Hameed thinks \\"Bughra Khan\\" is no ordinary goat. Hameed dresses the goat up like a gentleman wearing a hat and a tie around the neck. Faridi is constantly annoyed with Hameed’s goat. The myna (Hameed calls her \\"Bee Maina\\" - a traditional name for a myna in Urdu) is the last of his pets. This myna is extraordinary since she can not only speak Urdu words but is capable of carrying out longer conversations and mimic human emotions.

Anwar Anwar fleetingly delivers an opening in \\"Maut ki Aandhee\\" (The Hurricane of Death – #12). He is an intelligent crime reporter, ex-lawyer, who respects only Faridi in law enforcement agencies. During a discussion in the above book, Faridi tries to explain to Hameed why Anwar is so bitter about life. Due to his harsh past life, Anwar changed into an angry, ruthless, but brave individual. He has a philosophy on life and he calls it \\"Revenge\\". To him, revenge is the driving force behind life. Like Faridi, Imran, and Hameed, Anwar has also been bitten by love. Sajida was once involved with him but decided to leave Anwar for a businessman. Since then, Anwar desolated himself from the opposite sex and had been living in solitary. Sajida and her husband show up in \\"Heeray ki Kaan\\" (The Diamond Mine – #13) – the first book entirely on Anwar and Rasheeda's escapade. Anwars's character is another example of Ibn-e-Safi's creativity and innovation for crafting personalities. Anwar's character is developed such that the reader wants to love and hate him at the same time. He is a black mailer but only for evildoers. He insults Rasheeda on her idea of falling into love with her but loves her as a close friend. He can be an accomplice to a criminal on rare occasions but can also shoot them for committing crimes against humanity. He is a good guy acting like a bad one. After \\"Maut ki Aandhee\\", when Faridi and Hameed took a long vacation after solving the case of Vilman's Mechanical Windstorm, Ibn-e-Safi wrote four books based solely on Anwar and Rasheeda's adventures. These four novels include \\"Heeray ki Kaan\\" (The Diamond Mine – #13), \\"Tijori ka Geet\\" (The Song of the Safe – #14), \\"Aatishi Parinda\\" (The Flaming Bird – #15), and \\"Khooni Patthar\\" (The Killing Stone – 16). By the time of \\"Khooni Patthar\\", public demanded that Faridi and Hameed be brought back from their vacation. Ibn-e-Safi respected that demand and conjoined the talents of Anwar and Rasheeda with that of Faridi and Hameed in \\"Bhayanak Jazeera\\" (The Frightful Island – #17) that is actually a story on Rasheeda's background. Anwar is a crime reporter in \\"The Daily Star\\". He belongs to a very respectable rich family but, due to some differences of opinion, he lives alone. Anwar is a genius, and works as a private investigator. He plays it smart and keeps himself away from the police. Inspector Asif, a crooked police officer, is always asking for his help. However, as Anwar knows a lot about Asif's illegal tactics, he blackmails the inspector just to get free dinners or cover other expenses. In spite of his own intelligence, he respects Faridi and considers him as his Guru. Faridi obtains unofficial help from Anwar and Rasheeda in many cases. Rasheeda Rasheeda, lives in apartment next to Anwar's, and is his colleague and a close friend. Anwar is always in debt with Rasheeda because of his heavy spending, especially on cigarettes, books, and dining out. They are in a love-hate relationship. Rasheeda is a courageous young woman who can fight bravely against the criminals. Her character is portrayed in a very mysterious manner, until her actual identity is revealed in \\"Bhayanak Jazeera\\" (The Terrifying Island #17). Readers discover that she is the crown princess of a secret place called \\"Barren Island\\", raised outside her state because of the risk to her life from opponents. However, for the sake of Anwar, she does not accept the crown. Withdrawing herself in favour of another girl, she returns. Neelam Neelam's character is introduced in \\"Toofaan Ka Aghwaa\\" (The Abduction of a Storm – #67). Her father, a smuggler, was killed by one of his fellow gangsters. The same murderer also killed her mother when Neelam was only one year old. She often imagines herself in that rainy night when she was crying beside her mother's dead body on a street. She has a strong urge to get revenge for her parents' killing, which she eventually achieves. She has been raised by the leader of the smuggler's gang. In spite of living with criminals, she keeps herself away from crime and wants to get rid of their circle. When Faridi and Hameed searched for the smugglers, she finally got her chance, helping them break up the gang. Faridi then adopted her as a child. She usually calls Faridi 'Uncle' and Hameed 'Baba' (father). Initially, she assisted Faridi in \\"Rifle Ka Naghmaa\\" (The Song of the Rifle – #68), but is then sent abroad for higher studies in Criminology. She returns in \\"Neelam Ki Waapsi\\" (The Return of Neelam – #118). Qasim Qasim's character is the comic spirit of the Jasoosi Dunya Series. Whereas Hameed's sense of humour is more mature, Qasim's is the opposite: in other words, simplistic, childish, and spontaneous. Readers love and hate Qasim at the same time. On the one hand, Qasim deserves sympathy because he never had the freedom he needed as an adult and had a suppressed life before and after marriage. It is probably his suppressed upbringing that causes his speech irregularities. Qasim frequently switches some Urdu alphabets while speaking. On the other hand, he seems to be cheating on his wife and appears to be extremely unintelligent on occasion. But it is these mixed characteristics and the spontaneity of his character that provide an extreme comic relief in Jasoosi Dunya. Qasim is the only son of Khan Bahadur Asim, an industrialist and owner of Asim Textiles. Qasim is first introduced in Burf Kay Bhoot (Snow Ghosts – #33). However, Hameed meets Qasim for the first time in \\"Zahreela Aadmi\\" (The Venomous Man – #87) which is Faridi's early days' story. Qasim is moving a motor-cycle rider along with his motor-cycle from one place to another. (Qasim's rider had accidentally hit Qasim.) Hameed found Qasim very entertaining, and since the time they met they never separated. Qasim also comes up with these weird names for women. Since he is a huge man (seven feet tall and very fat), he likes healthy women and calls them full-falooties. Skinny, lightweight, and slim females on the other hand makes him very upset and hence deserve to be called \\"Yalayilee\\" in his opinion. This may have something to do with the fact that Qasim has never been able to develop a sexual relationship with his wife who belongs in the \\"Yalayilee\\" category. He detestfully calls her \\"Gilahri Begum\\" (Mrs. Squirrel) because of her petite figure. Qasim's hunger is unimaginable. He can finish several goat-legs and whole chickens without a single burp. In short, Qasim's appearance is more like that of a genie of Aladdin's lamp. Tariq Tariq is another interesting character created by Ibn-e-Safi. Tariq is an Arab by race but can speak several languages fluently. He is a wanderer. No one knows his sources of income and yet, Tariq never seem to have any monetary issues. Some think that Tariq is in search of old treasures. Tariq first appears in \\"Purasraar Kunwaan\\" (The Mysterious Well – #6) as Nawab Rasheed-uz-Zaman's close friend. His mysterious personality makes him a suspicious individual. But he comes clean at the end of the story. He is an expert hypnotist and has a brilliant shine in his eyes. Tariq carries a big, almost cat-sized mongoose that is considered a sacred animal in some South American tribes and called \\"Shaki\\" or \\"Shakaki\\". His actual talent is revealed in \\"Khooni Bagolay\\" (Bloody Fireballs – # 45) and \\"Zameen Ke Badal\\"(Clouds of the Earth – #75) where Tariq's linguistic as well as hypnotic abilities benefited Faridi to travel through some primeval, barbaric tribes and catch criminals.

She was the second wife of Emperor Xuan. Her father was the statesman Huo Guang, who served as regent for Emperor Zhao and who remained exceedingly powerful during Emperor Xuan's reign until his death in 68 BC. Her mother's name was Xian (顯).  Family background  It is not known when Chengjun was born to Huo Guang and Lady Xian. What is known is that she grew up in a household with such great power that in many ways, it regarded itself and was regarded as the real imperial household. She became accustomed to luxury living when she was young, and part of that was manifested in her customs of rewarding her servants with great wealth. She had an older sister who married Shangguan An, a son of Shangguan Jie; their daughter became Emperor Zhao's wife.  Marriage  In 74 BC, Emperor Zhao died at age 20. Huo initially selected his nephew, Prince He of Changyi as the new emperor. However, after Prince He quickly showed his unsuitability to be an emperor, Huo removed him from the throne and selected a commoner, the great-grandson of Emperor Wu and grandnephew of Emperor Zhao, Liu Bingyi (劉病已), to be emperor, and he accepted the throne as Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan was already married to Xu Pingjun when he accepted the throne, and he created Xu an imperial consort. When it came time to create an empress, the officials, knowing that it was Lady Xian's wishes, largely wanted Emperor Xuan to marry Huo Chengjun and create her empress. Emperor Xuan did not explicitly reject this proposal, but issued an order to seek out the sword that he owned as a commoner. Getting the hint, the officials recommended Consort Xu as empress, and she was created as such late in 74 BC. Lady Xian would not be denied what she wanted—having her daughter as an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu's female physician Chunyu Yan (淳于衍), under guise of giving Empress Xu medicine after she gave birth, to poison her. Chunyu did so, and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress properly. Lady Xian, alarmed, informed Huo Guang what had actually happened, and Huo, not having the heart to turn in his wife, instead signed Chunyu's release. In 70 BC, Emperor Xuan created Huo Chengjun empress. Accustomed to luxury living, her palace expenditures far exceeded the late Empress Xu. She tried to maintain a good relationship with her niece, Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan, but their relationship appeared to be not as cordial as Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan's relationship with the late Empress Xu, because Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan was intimidated by Empress Huo's status as her aunt.  Removal and death  In 68 BC, Huo Guang died. Emperor Xuan and Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan made the nearly-unprecedent act of personally attending Huo's wake and built an impressive mausoleum for Huo. After Huo's death, Emperor Xuan assumed far more personal powers than he had during Huo's lifetime. Empress Huo's brother Huo Yu (霍禹), nephews Huo Yun (霍雲) and Huo Shan (霍山), and brothers-in-law Fan Mingyou (范明友) and Deng Guanghan (鄧廣漢) remained in key posts, however. In 67 BC, Emperor Xuan created Prince Shi—the late Empress Xu's son—crown prince, and created Empress Xu's father Xu Guanghan (許廣漢) the Marquess of Ping'en—an action that Huo Guang had opposed. Lady Xian was shocked and displeased, because if her daughter were to have a son later, that son could only be a prince and not the future emperor. She instructed Empress Huo to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to begin stripping the Huos of actual power, while giving them impressive titles. In 66 BC, after there had been increasing public rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, Lady Xian finally revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. The conspiracy was discovered, and the entire Huo clan was executed by Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan then issued an edict deposing Empress Huo, in which he made no reference to what her family allegedly did but accused her of trying to poison Crown Prince Shi. She was kept in an unused palace. In 54 BC, he was set to exile her to another even more distant palace, and she committed suicide.

Notorious Criminals of Jasoosi DunyaLeonard= Refer to \\"Faridi aur Leonard\\" and \\"Leonard ki Waapsi\\". =Jabar= Jabar first appears in Khatarnaak Boodha (Urdu: خطرناک بوڑھا) and Masnoo-ee Naak (Urdu: مصنوعی ناک). Jabar has an Indo- Germanic background and becomes a criminal to take revenge from the society. He used to be made fun of when he was a kid. While he is growing up, his anger makes him attracted towards the philosophy of Nazism. Jabar, then, decides to take revenge upon all those who inflicted pain in his life. He comes back to India to take care of several issues. Blackmail, imposture, murders, robberies, gold making, and a secret to live for hundreds of years are some of those interests. He is also a chemist and a good scientist. During one of his experiments, steam from some chemical solution evaporated his nose. He uses an artificial nose to cover that small cave on his face. After Faridi caught him, Jabar killed himself in the courtroom using one of his own deadly poisons. =Gerald Shastri= Although a foreigner, Gerald Shashtri is a scholar of Sanskrit and an expert in Astrology and Hindu Philosophy. Apart from these apparent qualities, he is great scientist who invents a process to transform men into huge gorillas in Jungle Ki Aag (جنگل کی آگ). He plans to rule the world with the help of his scientific achievements. Although Faridi manages to break his mob, he escapes and returns in Maut Ki Chataan (موت کی چٹان). His main captivating aspect is in his eyes. His eyes seem to be free from emotions and separated from face. His emotions are not expressed through his eyes; Hameed is scared of him on first seeing his eyes. His eyes are called as veeraan (ویران) by Ibne Safi, it seems you can see through them. =Theresa= Theresa Bumblebee of Bohemia, first initiative her name used in famous Sholay Series (Flame Sereis) Jasoosi Dunya 56 to 59 Sholay Series. =Sung Hee= One of the most persistent, clever, daring, and disgusting villains created by Ibn-e-Safi, Sung Hee is one of the only two villains who has the honour of appearing and dueling with the heroes of both Jasoosi Dunya and Imran Series (the other being Theresa). Sung Hee is an expelled Chinese felon who was forced to leave his country after a failed Coup d'état. Since then he moved from country to country and tried to avail any opportunity to display his criminal, lustful, and avaricious nature. Born to a Chinese father and Mongolian mother, he is very thin in appearance with a visibly weak physique, but in reality is extremely strong and tough. He is famous, among those who know him somewhat, as \\"Jonk\\" (leech) for his ability to clench his enemy to suffocation and unconsciousness. Highly unreliable and erratic, Sung is one of those revolting individuals who commit crimes for the sake of entertainment. Assaulting innocent human beings is what he does when he gets bored though he never kills without reason. Not only that he enjoys breaking the law but he challenges the law enforcement while perpetrating crimes. Although Imran, during his academic phase of life, was first to meet him, Sung's first documented encounter was with Faridi in Neeli Lakeer (The Blue Streak – #42). He mocks Faridi and gets slapped by Faridi so hard that he stumbles several steps across the room. Instead of displaying rage, he shrugs it off by saying that many bums have slapped him but it was an honour to have been smacked by such a reputable celebrity as Faridi. It is quite obvious that he kept his anger confined to fuel the hatred and vengeance for a more suitable event. Such was his control over his emotions that makes him even more dangerous. Perhaps Sung Hee's most noticeable skill is his \\"Sung Art\\" of dodging bullets. Due to his very flexible and stretchable body, Sung Hee can easily dodge bullets fired at him from any reasonable distance. He observes the hand movement and direction of the firearm targeting him and escapes any injuries by performing prompt acrobatic movements. Another reason of his staying alive is that he also possesses a very awake, alert, and active mind. He changes strategies while executing one. He comes up with tricks and ideas that are hard to beat. Part of the reason that he could not be kept imprisoned for long is his quick backup schemes and arrangements. Women are his only weakness to the extent that he cannot live without sex. Wherever he goes, he finds a companion for his solitude. Often he tried to run away from the scene as soon as a former 'acquaintance' shows up suddenly. He is also an \\"equal- opportunity\\" lover and, except for gender, does not discriminate because of religion, caste, nationality, age, and appearance. That is also the reason he is the \\"most wanted\\" person for a good spanking anytime anywhere. Fans of the series love the interesting narrative between Sung Hi and Faridi or Imran. His relationship with Faridi is always that of a competitor. With Imran, however, his relationship has been known to change from friendly to friendly competitive to seriously competitive or notorious and unforgiving. Despite the fact that both characters are bloodthirsty for each other, the evil con man declares Imran to be his rightful nephew. Sung Hee holds a deep respect for both Faridi and Imran and prefers to trap and use them rather than kill them. In \\"Khooni Bagolay\\" (The Bloody Whirlwinds – #45) Sing praises Faridi to his partner. Sung's feelings and respect for Imran are expressed very clearly when, despite a great risk to Sung's own life, he kills the supposed murderer of Imran in \\"Laraztee Lakeerein\\" (The Shivering Lines – #111). He is accustomed to having multiple noteworthy opponents at a time. For example, in Jasoosi Duniya he had to contend with the brilliance of Faridi, the workings of Hameed and the betrayal of Finch. Fans believe that although Sung was defeated it was not without a valiant effort against three of the greatest heroes of Jasoosi Dunya. Similarly, he has had to deal with both Imran and Theresa at a time and has managed at times to come out on top. Remarkably, all this is done without the backing of any government or secret organisation, even though when he has joined hand with \\"Zeroland\\" and acted on its behalf for some span of time. =Dr. Salman= Dr. Salman is a psychologist by profession, and head of \\"Public Relations Bureau,\\" an organisation that claims to help people combat their enemies by using psychological techniques. In reality though, he is the head of the most powerful mob \\"Taaqat\\" (Force), a group that is trying to bring revolution in the country. He is the villain of Ibne Safi's best Shoalaa stories: Pehla Shoalaa, Doosra Shoalaa, Teesra Shoalaa, and Jahannam Ka Shoalaa. With the help of his psychological techniques and strange inventions, he has created a new world underneath the earth. Breaking up Dr. Salman's mob is perhaps the most difficult task that Faridi faces in Jasoosi Duniya. =Finch= Refer to \\"Zahreele Teer\\", \\"Paani Ka Dhuan\\", \\"Laash Ka Qahqaha\\", and \\"Dr. Dred\\". Finch is criminal character but is not criminal by nature. Dr. dread, a criminal character of ibn e safi, has forced him. Finch is another villain of the Dr. Dread series. Finch was initially a circus man, a midget at only four and half feet. Still, he manages to extend his height to normal by using bamboos. He used to raise an orphan girl, but one night Dr. Dread's mob kidnaps her. The next day her dead body is found on the streets. From that day on, Finch becomes a criminal, creating his own gang to take revenge on Dr. Dread. Readers usually sympathise with Finch in his fight against Dr. Dread. While Faridi manages to break Dr. Dread's mob, Finch escapes. He later reappears in Chamkeela Ghubaar and Zehreela Sayaarah. =Toyoda= Refer to \\"Japan ka Fitna\\" and \\"Dushmano ka Shaihar\\".and \\"Lash ka bulawa\\". =Nanota= She is also known as Doosri Nagin. Refer to \\"Tabahi ka Khawab\\" and \\"Mohlik Shanasaee\\". Nanota is an agent of Zeroland. In \\"Chandnee Ka Dhua'n\\", she is in charge of a mission that is exploring a rare fuel, with plans of stealing it from the earth. This substance is thousand times lighter than normal gasoline, and can be used for space travel. Her beauty is so exquisite that Artist Jeelani's painting of her face wins the first award at \\"International Art Exhibition\\". Ibne Safi has developed Nanota's character in such a magical way that readers are puzzled, initially believing her to be some sort of spirit or otherworldly being. However, in the end she emerges as a human being, narrowly escaping Faridi's grip. She appears again after many years in Tabaahee Ka Khwaab and Muhlik Shanaasa'ee. =Qalandar Bayabani= Qalandar Bayabani is ironically a spy storywriter. He dictates novels to his secretary on a microphone from his closed office. This façade of his is initially developed in Saatwaan Jazeerah. However, it is revealed in Shaitaanee Jheel that he is actually a smuggler whose gang steals five tons of gold. When naval police try chasing them down, he hides the gold in a lake; then starts scheming to get it back. In the end, he manages to dodge Faridi. He reappears in Sehmee Hu'ee Larkee and Qatil Ka Haath. This time, however, he is unable to escape Faridi's grip. =Reema= She is also known as Teesri Nagin. Refer to \\"Khooni Raishay\\", \\"Teesri Nagan\\" and \\"Raigum Bala\\".

At the base of Juktas, at Anemospilia, is a site that has suggested to some that the Minoans practiced human sacrifice, but the evidence is currently somewhat in question.  Peak Sanctuary  Mount Juktas is the site of one of the most important peak sanctuaries in the Minoan world, and probably the first of them. Archaeologists have studied the site over an extensive period, examining fragments of pottery, remains of walls, and some unique kinds of stone that must have been hauled up the mountain because they do not otherwise occur there. The mountain remains important in the religious life of the people of the area to this day - a Greek Orthodox chapel is located about a kilometer south of the sanctuary along the ridge of the mountain. Every year, people from towns down in the plains below Mount Juktas bring flowers in procession to the chapel. Archaeology Juktas was first excavated in 1909 by Sir Arthur Evans. It can be regarded as an adjunct archaeological site to the important Knossos site a few kilometres distant.C. Michael Hogan, 2007)] Among the finds at the Juktas Minoan peak sanctuary were clay human and animal figurines, stone horns, stone altars, bronze double axes, and both bowls and tables with Linear A inscriptions. See references for a more comprehensive inventory. Pottery sherds from the site date back as far as Middle Minoan IA.

She was the first American vessel lost in World War I. Alcedo was built in 1895 at Glasgow, Scotland, by D. and W. Henderson and Company. She was purchased by the Navy on 1 June 1917 from Mr. George W. C. Drexel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and commissioned at New York City on 28 July 1917, Lieutenant Commander William T. Conn, Jr., in command. Service history Assigned to the Patrol Force, Alcedo departed Newport, Rhode Island on 5 August 1917. Steaming via Newfoundland and the Azores, the yacht arrived at Brest, France on the 30th. During her brief Navy career, the yacht conducted anti-submarine patrols and convoy-escort missions along the French coast. On two occasions, she rescued crew members of torpedoed merchantmen. On 17 October, the little warship picked up 118 men from the troop transport steamer , which had been sunk by a submerged German U-boat. Twelve days later, she saved another 85 survivors from SS Finland. On the afternoon of 4 November, Alcedo departed Quiberon Bay, France with , and as the escort for a convoy composed of SS Florence Luckenbach, SS Artemis, and SS Newport News bound for Brest. At about 01:45 the following morning, while the convoy was steaming some west of Belle He, an Alcedo crewman reported sighting a surfaced U-boat. Almost instantaneously with the sounding of the alarm, the German submarine UC-71 fired a single torpedo in a surface attack. (Some Alcedo records suggest that the U-boat submerged first, but the official German account confirms a surface attack.) Alcedo attempted to change course to evade the torpedo, but she answered her helm sluggishly. The torpedo struck the yacht on the port side well forward, and Alcedo began to settle fast. Soon after the hit, the ship's commanding officer ordered her abandoned, and she went down in eight minutes. The yacht lost one officer, Lieutenant, junior grade John Melvin, and 20 sailors in the action to both wounds and drowning. The remainder of her crew took to the boats in two separate groups. After a long time rowing, one group — which included the commanding officer — was picked up by a French torpedo boat. The other was towed to safety by French fishermen. Alcedo's name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 December 1917.

After six years of balancing first-class cricket in summer, professional football in winter and study for a degree in architecture, Walker earned a place in the Australian cricket team in 1973 and represented his country in the sport until injury ended his career in 1981. Following his retirement he worked as an architect and also commenced a career in radio and television media. He wrote 14 books over a period of thirty years and became a successful public speaker. His unorthodox cricket bowling action earned him the nickname \\"Tangles\\", and his larrikin character made him a much-loved figure with the Australian public. Walker died of multiple myeloma on 28 September 2016 after being diagnosed with the disease three years earlier.  Early life and education Walker was born in Hobart, Tasmania, on 12 September 1948. While in high school he represented Tasmania as an opening batsman in their colts team, scoring a century in one match. After graduating from a Hobart high school in 1967 he relocated to Melbourne to play football and also enrolled in an architecture degree at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. He graduated with a fellowship diploma in 1973.  Football career  In 1966, while still a high school student, Melbourne Football Club coach Norm Smith visited Walker's family home in Hobart to sign him to the Demons. He relocated from Hobart to Melbourne in 1967 and made his VFL debut the same year. He spent six seasons with Melbourne, playing 85 games as a ruckman and defender and earning one Brownlow Medal vote in 1968. After returning from the Australian cricket team's 1972–73 tour of the West Indies, Walker informed the club that he would not be joining them for the 1973 VFL season, as the season was about to start and he needed to complete a thesis for his university degree.  Cricket career  Upon moving to Melbourne in 1967 Walker joined the Melbourne Cricket Club. Although he earned a reputation as a batsman as a junior, he was given an opportunity to open the bowling attack for Melbourne, which showed his true cricket potential. His strange bowling action, bowling right arm over his right leg, earned Walker the nickname of \\"Tanglefoot\\" which was quickly shortened to \\"Tangles\\". He made his first-class debut for Victoria in February 1969 against Queensland, the final match of Victoria's 1968–1969 Sheffield Shield season. Despite taking five wickets in the match, he did not get a chance to play in the 1969–1970 season due to the depth in Victoria's bowling. He earned a second match in December 1970 and became a regular in the 1971–72 season, playing a total of 135 matches for Victoria. He made his test debut for Australia in the second Test against Pakistan that commenced on 29 December 1972. He took five wickets in the match and retained his place in the team for the next match, the final of the series. In that match, a final innings performance of 6–15 by Walker prevented Pakistan from winning the match. During the series he was selected for Australia's tour of the West Indies that ran from February to April 1973. Walker played a total of 34 Tests, taking 138 wickets as a medium-fast bowler. He played in 17 ODIs between 1974 and 1981, as well as playing in the breakaway World Series Cricket from 1977 to 1979. His final match for Australia was the infamous underarm match between Australia and New Zealand on 1 February 1981. An Achilles tendon injury subsequently forced his retirement from cricket. Post-retirement from cricket After retiring from competitive cricket in 1981 Walker practised architecture for 10 years. He also became a celebrity on television and radio, as well as a successful author and public speaker. = Media career = Once he retired from cricket, Walker first appeared on radio, calling cricket for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) with Drew Morphett and Alan McGilvray for four years from 1981. He was also part of the commercial radio cricket coverage run by 2UE and 3AK. His first television appearances date back to 1982, where he was the cricket expert on Channel 7's World of Sport. After moving to Channel 9 in 1985, he was also part of National Nine News Melbourne with Brian Naylor, reading sports reports on the nightly news. He also hosted the Nine Network's The Sunday Footy Show from 1993–1998 and Nine's Wide World of Sports program until it was cancelled in 1999. He was also a commentator for Channel Nine's cricket matches between 1986 and 1991. In 2005 he appeared on the Nine Network's sports show Any Given Sunday, hosted by James Brayshaw, as well as ABC2's sports program Late Night Legends featuring highlights of the 1974–75 Ashes series in which Walker had a prominent role. Walker's distinctive broad Australian accent was parodied in several albums by The Twelfth Man (Billy Birmingham), including being featured as the central character on the 1994 album Wired World of Sports II. It follows Walker through a day at his job at the Nine Network in which he assaults co-host Ken Sutcliffe in order to increase his chances of regaining a place on the cricket commentary team. He also appeared in television advertisements throughout his career, commencing with an Aerogard commercial in the mid-1970s. = Writing career = Max Walker was also the author of 14 books with total sales exceeding one million copies. His first book, Tangles (written with Neil Phillipson), was an autobiography published in 1976. His subsequent books contained light-hearted anecdotes from his career, with titles such as The Wit of Walker, How to Kiss a Crocodile and How to Puzzle a Python. His final book Caps, Hats and Helmets was released in 2006. =Public speaking= Following the cancellation of Nine's Wide World of Sports in 1999, Walker commenced appearing on the public speaking circuit. He turned it into a successful business and continued speaking until at least 2015. Walker held the designation of Certified Speaking Professional which is the highest accreditation within Professional Speakers Australia. In 2016 he presented a keynote address at the Professional Speakers Australia annual convention. He received the Educator of the Year award from Professional Speakers Australia at that same convention. Honours On 13 June 2011, Walker was named a Member of the Order of Australia for service to cricket at a national and international level as a player and commentator, and to the community through a range of youth and social welfare organisations. Personal life Walker was married twice and had five children, three sons from his first marriage and two daughters with his second wife Kerry. He was an avid collector of fountain pens and featured in one episode of the ABC's Collectors. Walker died from multiple myeloma on 28 September 2016, after being diagnosed in August 2013.

The introduction of CMP project represented efforts by the autonomous Zapatista communities to tell their own stories, in their own languages and from their own perspectives.Chiapas Media Project. Single page flyer. Chicago: Chiapas Media Project. Interference Archive collection.  Work  With CMP, the Zapatista communities have produced videos on agricultural collectives, fair trade coffee, women's collectives, autonomous education, traditional healing, and the history of their struggle for land. With the Community Human Rights Defenders Network, CMP produced a video about the work of this group to educate other communities. Videos produced with Community Human Rights Devenders Network were used as evidence in court proceedings related to human rights abuses, resulting in compensation to indigenous families. In Guerrero, CMP worked with the Organization of Campesino Environmentalists to document and draw attention to the destruction of virgin forests in the region. CMP/Promedios built four media centers in the state of Chiapas, including facilities for video production and satellite internet access. Zapatista videos have been screened at film festivals, college and university campuses, and other locations across the globe. Training was provided out of a CMP Media Center in San Cristobal de las Casas. CMP organized delegations of youth from the United States to meet with human rights, religious, and women's organizations, travelling to other communities to screen current productions and meet with other indigenous groups.

The district comprises 15,595.6 square kilometres and as of 2002 has a population of 60,200. Kapit is accessible by boat (slightly more than 2 hours from Sibu by express boat) light aircraft, and most recently by road (though the road is still unfinished).https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2019/06/03/gawai- revellers-jam-incomplete-road-to-kapit Reaching Kapit by car from Sibu takes about 1 hour 30 minutes or about 1 hour from Song. It is the vibrant commercial and social center for the middle Rajang River catering to the longhouse communities and timber camps. It is an excellent base for exploring nearby longhouses or for arranging trips to the Upper Rejang and Balleh Rivers. EtymologyHistory During the reign of Rajah Charles Brooke, a \\"Fort Kapit\\" was built in Kapit in 1880 to prevent the Iban from migrating up- river and attacking Orang Ulu settlements. With the security provided by the fort, the area surrounding the fort was settled by Hoklo (Hokkien) Chinese in 1880, additional Hakka Chinese immigrants arrived in 1906, and Fuzhou Chinese in 1919. The Hokkiens worked as labourers while the Hakkas worked as farmers before venturing into businesses. Hock Leong Tieng Temple was built by the Chinese in 1889. Tai San Ten Association was formed in 1935 to serve the interests of Hokkiens and Hakkas. In 1924, a peace treaty was signed between the Iban and the Orang Ulu people at Fort Kapit, thus ending the hostilities between the two tribes permanently. In 1925, \\"Fort Kapit\\" was renamed as Fort Sylvia, after the wife of Rajah Vyner Brooke, Rani Sylvia Brooke. The fort had withstood floods in 1887, 1934, 1961 and 1983. On 28 January 1934, Kapit experienced the most severe flood in history with water level as high as . In 1941, at the time of the Japanese occupation, Kapit only had two rows of 37 shophouses. The town was completely destroyed by allied bombing during the war. On 15 February 1962, 51 elected Iban chiefs had a meeting in Kapit to discuss the terms and proposals of the formation of federation of Malaysia. Kapit was upgraded into a division on 2 April 1973. Government Built in 1880, Fort Sylvia once housed the Kapit district office and a magistrate court. After 1973, it housed the Kapit Divisional Office. Geography and climate Kapit is located 140 km upriver from Sibu along the Rajang River. Demographics Immaculate Conception Church was first established in Kapit in 1882.

The album sold well among the Christian metal fans, especially Stryper fans. However, it did not gather any mainstream success. The band played in several festivals in the United States. Notorious among these was a summer rock festival in Puerto Rico, where former frontman of Stryper, Michael Sweet, joined Sin Dizzy on stage in front of 11,000 and performed several Stryper hit songs. Bassist Tim Gaines left the band in 2000 to continue working with his wife's musical career. Kevin Walt immediately replaced Gaines as SinDizzy's bass player.

Brasseur's character is a plastic surgeon who is determined to perform a face transplant on his daughter, who was disfigured in an auto crash. During the film's production, consideration was given to the standards of European censors by setting the right tone, minimizing gore and eliminating the mad scientist character. Although the film passed through the European censors, the film's release in Europe caused controversy nevertheless. Critical reaction ranged from praise to disgust. The film received an American debut in an edited and dubbed form in 1962 under the title of The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. In the United States, Faustus was released as a double feature with The Manster. The film's initial critical reception was not overtly positive, but subsequent theatrical and home video re-releases improved its reputation. Modern critics praise the film for its poetic nature as well as being a notable influence on other filmmakers. Plot At night just outside Paris, a woman drives along a riverbank and dumps a corpse in the river. After the body is recovered, Dr. Génessier identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane Génessier, whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance, for which he was responsible. Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds and other large dogs. Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it's explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word. Christiane (Édith Scob) fails to make a phone call to Jacques Vernon. Scob's face is hidden behind a face-like mask for most of the film. Louise lures a young Swiss girl named Edna Grüber to Génessier's home. Génessier chloroforms Edna and takes her into his secret laboratory. Christiane secretly watches her father and Louise carry Edna to the lab, and then goes to tenderly caress the dogs her father keeps caged, who eagerly accept her love, and are unaffected by her appearance. Dr. Génessier performs heterograft surgery, removing Edna's face. The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, Génessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being rejected and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise. Jacques reports the call to the police, who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, hires a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier. Génessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him. While the doctor talks with the police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, while slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and murders Louise by stabbing her in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an abandoned German Shepherd he had only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring his face in the process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves in her hands. Cast * Pierre Brasseur as Doctor Génessier, physician and father of Christiane. Génessier experiments on his pet dogs and performs heterograft surgeries on women to try and restore the face of his daughter Christiane. Brasseur previously worked with director Georges Franju in the drama, La Tête contre les murs (1958), again in a leading role playing a doctor. * Édith Scob as Christiane Génessier, Doctor Génessier's daughter. Christiane's face was damaged in a car accident caused by her father. For most of the film, her face is covered by a stiff mask that resembles her face before the accident. Like Brasseur, Scob was also cast by Franju in La Tête Contre les Murs, but in a minor role. Scob later worked with Franju on four other films. * Alida Valli as Louise, a woman who is Génessier's assistant, kidnaps young women, assists him in the laboratory and acts as a surrogate mother to Christiane. Louise aids Génessier partly because of his help in restoring her damaged face in events that happened before the film begins. * François Guérin as Jacques Vernon, a student of Génessier and Christiane's fiancé. Jacques is unaware of Doctor Génessier's criminal activity and believes Christiane is dead. After receiving a phone call from Christiane, he helps the police in investigating the crime. * Juliette Mayniel as Edna Grüber, a young woman who becomes a victim of Doctor Génessier's experiments after being befriended by Louise in Paris. Edna is the first woman whose face is successfully transplanted to Christiane. While recovering from the surgery, she attacks Louise and then leaps from a window at Génessier's home and dies. * Alexandre Rignault as Inspector Parot, a police inspector investigating the disappearances of Génessier's victims. Parot ultimately discovers that all of the missing girls have similar features. * Béatrice Altariba as Paulette Mérodon, a young woman who is taken into police custody after being caught shoplifting. Due to a resemblance with the women Génessier has kidnapped, she is informed by Parot that the charges against her will be dropped if she checks into Génessier's clinic. She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have her face transplanted, but is saved by Christiane before Génessier is able to perform surgery on her. Production At the time, modern horror films had not been attempted by French film makers until producer Jules Borkon decided to tap into the horror market. Borkon bought the rights to the Redon novel and offered the directorial role to one of the founders of Cinémathèque Française, Franju, who was directing his first non- documentary feature La Tête contre les murs (1958). Franju had grown up during the French silent-film era when filmmakers such as Georges Méliès and Louis Feuillade were making fantastique-themed films, and he relished the opportunity to contribute to the genre. Franju felt the story was not a horror film; rather, he described his vision of the film as one of \\"anguish... it's a quieter mood than horror... more internal, more penetrating. It's horror in homeopathic doses.\\" To avoid problems with European censors, Borkon cautioned Franju not to include too much blood (which would upset French censors), refrain from showing animals getting tortured (which would upset English censors) and leave out mad-scientist characters (which would upset German censors). All three of these were part of the novel, presenting a challenge to find the right tone for presenting these story elements in the film. First, working with Claude Sautet who was also serving as first assistant director and who laid out the preliminary screenplay, Franju hired the writing team of Boileau-Narcejac (Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) who had written novels adapted as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques (1955) and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). The writers shifted the novel's focus from Doctor Génessier's character to that of his daughter, Christiane; this shift revealed the doctor's character in a more positive and understandable light and helped to avoid the censorship restrictions. For his production staff, Franju enlisted people with whom he had previously worked on earlier projects. Cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan, best remembered for developing the Schüfftan process, was chosen to render the visuals of the film. Schüfftan had worked with Franju on La Tête Contre les Murs (1958). Film historian David Kalat called Shüfftan \\"the ideal choice to illustrate Franju's nightmares\\". French composer Maurice Jarre created the haunting score for the film. Jarre had also previously worked with Franju on his film La Tête Contre les Murs (1958). Modern critics note the film's two imposing musical themes, a jaunty carnival- esque waltz (featured while Louise picks up young women for Doctor Génessier) and a lighter, sadder piece for Christiane. Release The film was released in America as The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus along with The Manster in 1962. In this poster, the distributors play on the artistic nature of the film that modern critics would later praise. Eyes without a Face completed filming in 1959, and was premiered in Paris on March 2, 1960. Although it passed through the European censors, the film caused controversy on its release in Europe. The French news magazine L'Express commented that the audience \\"dropped like flies\\" during the heterografting scene. During the film's showing at the 1960 Edinburgh Film Festival, seven audience members fainted, to which director Franju responded, \\"Now I know why Scotsmen wear skirts.\\" For the American release in 1962, the film was edited, dubbed into English, and re-titled The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. Edits in the Dr. Faustus version removed parts of the heterografting scene as well as scenes showing Doctor Génessier's more human side, such as his loving care for a small child at his clinic. The distributors recognized the artistic merit of the film and played up that element in promotion with an advertisement quoting the London Observers positive statements about the film and noting its showing at the Edinburgh Film Festival. This was in contrast to the presentation of the secondary feature, The Manster (1962), which mainly focused on the carny-show aspect with its \\"two-headed monster\\" and \\"Invasion from outer space by two- headed creature killer\\". Eyes Without a Face had a very limited initial run and there was little commentary from the American mainstream press. Reception On the film's initial release, the French critics' general response was moderate, ranging from mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment, claiming it to be either a repetition of German expressionism or simply a disappointment of the director's leap from documentary filmmaker to a genre film-maker claiming the film to be in a \\"minor genre, quite unworthy of his abilities\\". Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously. In England, Isabel Quigly, film critic for The Spectator, called it \\"the sickest film since I started film criticism\\", while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired. A review in Variety was negative, noting specifically that the \\"stilted acting, asides to explain characters and motivations, and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact\\" and an \\"unclear progression and plodding direction give [the film] an old-fashioned air\\". The English Monthly Film Bulletin was of the opinion that \\"when a director as distinguished as Georges Franju makes a horror film...one cannot but feel tempted to search for symbols, an allegory, layers, or interpretation. Unhappily there is practically nothing in this inept work to offer any encouragement for doing so.\\" The review said there was \\"a strange and poetic opening\\" and Schuftan's \\"haunting camerawork allies itself perfectly to Maurice Jarre's obsessive score\\" while\\" Brasseur and Valli were \\"sadly wasted\\" and that they \\"do what they can with almost non-existent characters\\". Eyes Without a Face received a theatrical re-release in September 1986 in conjunction with retrospectives at the National Film Theatre in London and at the Cinémathèque Française for the film archive's 50th anniversary in France. As Franju was the archive's co-founder, the Cinémathèque Française celebrated by presenting the director's back catalogue. With the renewed interest, the film's critical reputation began to be re-evaluated. French critics' response to the film was significantly more positive than it was on its original release, with former editor-in-chief of Cahiers du cinéma Serge Daney calling the film \\"a marvel\\". The film was re-released in its original and uncut form to American theaters on October 31, 2003. Based on 54 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, Eyes Without a Face received an average 98% fresh rating with an average rating of 8.4/10. The reviewers commented on the film's poetic nature and noted the strong influence of French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader praised the film, referring to it as \\"absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale\\". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice declared the film \\"a masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful, tactile brutality\\". The Encyclopedia of Horror Films agreed with the assertion of Cocteau's influence, stating that \\"Franju invests [the film] with a weird poetry in which the influence of Cocteau is unmistakable\\". David Edelstein, writing for Slate, commented that \\"the storyline is your standard obsessed-mad-doctor saga, one step above a Poverty Row Bela Lugosi feature ... [b]ut it's Lugosi by way of Cocteau and Ionesco\\". In the 2010s, Time Out polled authors, directors, actors and critics who had worked in the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Time Out placed Eyes Without a Face at number 34 on the top 100. Soundtrack In February 2005, the French soundtrack record label Play Time released the soundtrack on compact disc along with other soundtracks performed by Jarre. This also includes soundtracks from other Franju films including La Tête contre les Murs and Thérèse Desqueyroux. Legacy The film has influenced a number of European films since its release. Spanish director Jesús Franco created films throughout his career that were influenced by the film. Franco's first such film was the Spanish/French co-production Gritos en la noche (1962). Franco's version of the story concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon, Dr. Orloff, to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa. Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orloff using his girlfriend, Wanda Bronsky, as an undercover spy. Franco followed the film with several sequels to Gritos en la noche. He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film, Faceless (1988). Faceless has a similar plot involving beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. Flamand's (Helmut Berger) female assistant and kept hostage. The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister, but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead. The Italian film Atom Age Vampire (1961) was also influenced by Eyes Without a Face with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter's face. These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes. The lieutenant's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic, a similar plot motivation to Eyes Without a Face. The British film Corruption (1968), starring Peter Cushing adds a new variation to the theme: a surgeon tries to restore his fiancée's beauty by repeatedly treating her with fluids extracted from the pituitary glands of murdered female victims. Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has stated his film The Skin I Live In (2011), which features a mad scientist who performs skin grafts and surgeries on an unwilling victim, was heavily influenced by Eyes without a Face. American film director John Carpenter has suggested that the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew \\"didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why Debra [Hill] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face.\\"Carpenter, John (2003). A Cut Above the Rest (Halloween: 25th Anniversary Edition DVD Special Features) (DVD Region 2). Anchor Bay, 2003. DVD film reviews have suggested the film influenced director John Woo; critics have compared the graphic detail of the face transplant scene in Woo's action film Face/Off (1997) to the face transplant scene in Eyes Without a Face. Another resemblance is Woo's use of white doves in his films that is similar to the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale. In 2001, on VH1 Storytellers,VH1 Storytellers, Episode 53, April 19, 2001. singer Billy Idol cited the film as giving him the idea for his song \\"Eyes Without a Face.\\" The song, which has the film's original French title (\\"Les Yeux Sans Visage\\") as the recurring background chorus, takes the father-daughter relationship from the film and recasts it as the deteriorated relationship between the narrator and his lover. The song became Idol's first top-10 hit in the U.S. =Home video= Eyes Without a Face was released on VHS on January 9, 2001 by Kino Video and on DVD on October 19, 2004 by the Criterion Collection. The DVD also contains Georges Franju's first documentary Blood of the Beasts (1949), a depiction of a French slaughterhouse. A Region 2 release of Eyes Without a Face was released April 21, 2008 by Second Sight Films. A Region 4 edition of the film was released on July 2, 2007 by Umbrella Entertainment. The disc also included Franju's documentary Blood of the Beasts.

The Secret Service is administered by the Secretary of Internal Affairs, Sir Sultan,Characters Imran Series The official website of the author who offers Imran the position as its head after getting personal help from him in Raat ka Shahzadah (The Prince of Night – #8). Ali Imran Ali ImranCharacter of Ali Imran The official website of the author is a pivotal character in Imran Series. Handsome and bright, the young-man holds MSc, and PhD degrees from Oxford University and has extraordinary sex appeal. He always appears comical and moronic, using these features to camouflage himself as one of the stupidest men. Always shown acting stupid, insane, and funny, he keeps the readers in hysterics at his every action. He never reveals his true side to anyone. He usually dresses eccentrically; for example, a pink coat, a light green shirt, a yellow necktie, white pants, and a purple flat hat with a red rose in it is his typical apparel. Ibne Safi refers to this as Imran's \\"Technicolor Outfit.\\" Imran is son of Amma Bi and Mr. Abdul-ur-Rahman, Director General of Central Intelligence Bureau and as being from Genghis Khan's bloodline, he has Mongol lineage. He resides in an apartment with his two most trusted assistants: Sulaiman, the cook, and Joseph Mugunda, his bodyguard. He is, most of the time, seen driving a two-seater sports car. Imran purposefully keeps multi facets to his personality. As Imran—Ali Imran—he acts as an opportunist who can turn either a police informer or a blackmailer as the situation demands. A perfect cover to his profession. His other most significant personality facet is the Chief of the Secret Services: X-2. Only three other characters know his secret: Sir Sultan, Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; “Black Zero,” or Tahir, who acts as X-2 in Imran’s absence; and Roshni, a long time friend and a trusted partner. The other two personalities Imran assumes now and then are the Prince of Dhump, a warlord of a fictitious state known as Dhump, and Rana Tahavvar Ali Sandooqui, a wealthy landlord and businessman. Imran works as a normal member of the Secret Service and none of the other members had a slightest clue of his being their chief officer. These agents usually laugh him off and sneer at him, but as X-2, they really dread him. Imran's favourite agent is Safder Saeed. Imran has perfected the art of dodging bullets. It is called \\"Sing Art,\\" which he learns from an international Chinese criminal, Sing Hee. Imran calls him Uncle Sing (Chacha Sing) and in return, Sing Hee refers him as nephew. His another old time foe is T3B, Theresia Bumble-Bee of Bohemia. Theresia has a great crush on him but Imran hardly pay heed to her rather jeer at her sentiments. He, like Col. Ahmad Kamal Faridi, has impregnable character vis-à-vis women. Due to his naive appearance and innocent looks, women are smitten with him, but he usually gives them a cold shoulder. Other characters One of Ibn-e- Safi's distinguished writing qualities include formation and development of characters. He has established characters in such a fashion that they appear to be real and materialised. And, Imran Series has a range of diverse, colourful, and sentient characters. X-2, the chief of the secret service, in fact is Ali Imran (sometimes played by Tahir aka Black Zero). The members of the X-2's team are: Juliana Fitzwater, Safdar Saeed, Tanveer Ashraf, Khawar, Chauhan, Nomani, Siddeeque, Zafar ul Mulk, Jameson, and Nimi. Sir Sultan, Secretary of the Ministry of foreign affairs, is Imran or X-2's boss. Roshni, an Anglo-Burmese girl, is Imran's long time friend; she was Imran's working partner for sometime, but later left him. Captain Fayyaz is the Superintendent of the Central Intelligence Bureau. Not very sharp or intelligent, he with the help of Imran is able to solve numerous cases, which resulted in his promotions. Imran resides in a flat with his cook, Sulaiman, Sulaiman's wife, Gul-Rukh and the Central African bodyguard, Joseph Mugunda. Imran's family includes his father Karam Rahman (also mentioned as Abdul Rahman in initial books), Director General of Central Intelligence Bureau, mother Amma Bi, and sister Suraiya. Suraiya marries Dr. Shahid in the books, Adha Teetar and Adha Batair. In series written by Ibn-E-Safi, One of a biggest foe of Imran was Tsung Hi, a chinese criminal who on certain occasions favored Imran by not killing him or harming him and vice versa.He was described as a tall, very thin man with glowing eyes full of energy.Imran considered him one of his worthy adversary and vice versa.Tsung Hi was a master in martial art as well as a very intelligent individual.He knew a very lesser known art of deceiving bullets from a very close range which Imran was able to learn from him in their first encounter in London during his study in Oxford. He joyfully calls Imran Bhatija(son of one's brother) meaning nephew in return to which Imran used to call him chacha meaning uncle. Now-a-days in new books written by Mazhar Kaleem, names of characters are given below, namely: Tahir/Black Zero, Ali Imran MSc and D.Sc. (oxen), Juliana Fitzwater (Julia), Sualeha, Safdar Saeed, Tanveer Ashraf, Captain Shakeel, Siddeeque, Chauhan, Khawar, Nomani, Captain Babar (in some novels), Tiger (Rizwan), Joseph, Juana, Sulaiman, Sir Sultan etc. For a detailed account of characters appearing in Imran Series, please visit more links at the bottom of this page.  Headquarters of the Secret Service Daanish Manzil was the initial headquarters of the Secret Services. It, however, was exposed thus destroyed in one of the adventures (see Sugarbank trilogy) and the Secret Services was forced to shift its headquarters to a new building called \\"Psycho Mansion,\\" which operates under the semblance of a psychiatric clinic. Till Safi's last book \\"Psycho Mansion\\" maintains its status of being the headquarters. The members of the Secret Service, from time to time, also use another building, the mansion of \\"Rana Palace,\\" as a hideout and operations centre. Plagiarism During 1960–1963, while Ibn-e-Safi was suffering from schizophrenia, many amateur writers started posing themselves as Ibn-e-Safi and produced third class copies of his work, distorting the character of not only Ali Imran, but also of Colonel Faridi and Captain Hameed. These acts of vandalism were reported by Ibn-e-Safi himself in the preface of Daidh Matwaalay (One and a Half Amused – #42), the book he returned with after his recovery. Some writers and publishers still continue to write on Safi's characters, much to the annoyance of many fans. Safi used to mention fans' complaints sometimes in the prefaces, and mocked the fake publishers and writers in his own witty style. After the death of Ibn-e-Safi, Mazhar Kaleem writes books in the series, and has introduced many new characters in the series. Mazhar Kaleem also passed away on 26 May 2018. Some fans of Ibn-e-Safi dismiss Kaleem's books, arguing that Kaleem distorted the original 'feel' of the series, and that he deformed the key characteristics of many characters, including Ali Imran. Nevertheless, his books have a significant readership. The writers who continued writing their own versions of Imran Series (specially after the death of Mr. Safi) included Mazhar Kaleem, Safdar Shaheen, Ibn-e-Rahat, Mushtaq Ahmed Qureshi, H Iqbal, Ayne Safi, MA Rahat, MA Sajid, Ibn-e-Kaleem, Azhar Kaleem, MA Peerzada, S Qureshi, N Safi, Nasir Javed, Zaheer Ahmed (Author), Irshad Alaser Jaferi, Syed Ali Hassan Gillani, and Ali Nawazish. Mazhar Kaleem enjoyed enough following. He introduced many new characters in the series. Differences between Mazhar Kaleem And Ibne Safi Some of the differences between Ibn-e- Safi's and Mazhar Kaleem's books are as follows: * Ibn-e-Safi's writing style can mostly be categorised under mystery fiction (with the exception of a few adventures). Mazhar Kaleem, however, does not rely on mystery but on action- oriented situational twists, with the overall plot of the story revealed in the first few chapters. * Ibn-e-Safi's Ali Imran, although highly intelligent, is not a super-human; Kaleem portrays him as a \\"man of all qualities\\" and \\"indestructible\\". * Although Ibn-e-Safi never explicitly stated the name of Imran's country, he used to mention the real names of other countries and cities. Kaleem uses aliases for all country and city names (except Israel). * Ibn-e-Safi brought Ali Imran and Colonel Fareedi together just once in his novels (and that too in Jasoosi Dunya special number). Kaleem has done that many times, openly favouring Ali Imran against Faridi. (Kaleem has not written any story with Faridi as the main protagonist.) * Many main characters created by Ibn-e-Safi are not present in Kaleem's books. Examples include Roshee, Zafar-ul-Mulk, Jameson, Sing Hee, T3B and others. (Ibn-e-Safi threatened to take legal action against those writers and publishers who would use the characters of Zafar-ul-Mulk and Jameson in their own publications.) Some of the main characters introduced by Kaleem are Captain Shakeel, Juana, Tiger, Shagal, Madaam Rikha, Sualeha, Fisal Jaan, Col. Hillgard, and Inspector Arif. * In Ibn-e-Safi's Imran series Sulaiman is later married to a girl named Gul Rukh, but in Mazhar Kaleem's novels, Sulaiman is still a bachelor.

The strip originally started as a parody of an earlier comic called Kieku ja Kaiku, and takes obvious inspiration from it. Kieku ja Kaiku was an educational children's comic strip about two anthropomorphic young roosters. One of them, called Kaiku, would usually do something foolish, and the other, called Kieku, would then look after him, giving an educational message to the young readers. The comic's dialogue was all in poetic verse. Rieku ja Raiku is aimed at a more mature audience. It is drawn in a more cartoony and less realistic style. The characters, Rieku and Raiku, are nondescript adult male birds, whose adventures mainly concern going out to bars to drink booze and try to pick up female birds. The poetic verse of the dialogue has been faithfully preserved, but it doesn't have educational messages any more.

The building was completed in 1832, one year after Augusta became the capital of Maine. Built using Maine granite, the State House was based on the design of the Massachusetts State House (Maine was formerly part of Massachusetts, and became a separate state in 1820). Governor Janet Mills and the Maine Legislature convene at the State House. History Maine State House as originally designed (image from mid-1800s) Maine State House featured on a postcard from the 1930s Maine State House prior to reconstruction Maine capitol dome under reconstruction (August 2014) When Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a state in 1820, a number of cities and towns sought the honor of becoming the state capital. The principal aspirants were Portland, Brunswick, Hallowell, Waterville, Belfast, Wiscasset, and Augusta. The first capital of Maine was Portland, but it moved to Augusta because of its more central location. The Legislature passed and Governor Enoch Lincoln signed the bill establishing Augusta as the capital in 1832. After careful consideration of various sites on both sides of the river, the governor and the Commissions chose a lot for the Maine State House and extending from the old Hallowell road to the Kennebec River. The building was designed by the renowned architect Charles Bulfinch of Boston, and in its original form resembles his Massachusetts State House. About in length, including the central portion with columns and cupola and two wings extending north and south, the building's cornerstone was laid on July 4, 1829, amid impressive Masonic ceremonies. Construction was of granite from Hallowell quarries and took three years to complete. The cost of the building was originally estimated to be $80,000, but when completed, expenditures of the building, furnishings and grounds amounted to $139,000, of which $11,500 was contributed by the city of Augusta. The Maine Legislature held its first session in the new state Capitol on January 4, 1832. The interior of the Capitol was remodeled in 1852 and again in 1860 to provide additional room for state departments. In 1890–1891, a large three-story wing was added to the rear of the building to accommodate the State Library and to provide more office space for departments. Major remodeling of the Capitol during 1909–1910 established the present-day appearance of the building. It was enlarged according to designs by G. Henri Desmond, necessitating the demolition of almost all the old buildings save the front and rear walls. While the noble Bulfinch front was preserved, the length of the building was doubled to by extending the north and south wings. A dome rising to a height of was built to replace the original cupola. A gilt copper statue of Minerva, the draped female figure of Wisdom, by William Clark Noble of Gardiner, surmounted the dome. The House of Representatives occupies the third and fourth floors of the north wing and the Senate chambers occupy similar quarters in the south wing. The governor's office is located in renovated space on the second floor at the rear of the central portion of the Capitol along with the Hall of Flags and the law library. The governor's office overlooks the massive, granite State Office Building located to the west of the State House. A recently renovated tunnel connects the State House and the State Office Building. The tunnel houses several Maine wildlife scenes. A side tunnel leads to a cold war fallout shelter, large enough to house the Maine senate, house and various other officials and aides. Construction of the shelter started on May 5, 1983, under the pretense of renovation; completed September 3, 1985, and it has been fully stocked and staffed ever since. At the south side of the Capitol grounds, the Maine State Library, Maine State Museum and Maine State Archives are housed in a modern building. Throughout the building are portraits of governors and other men and women who have served Maine throughout its history as a province and a state. To the north, across from the State House, is the Executive Mansion, more commonly known as The Blaine House, which Harriet Blaine Beale presented to the state in 1919. The State House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, for its importance in the history of the state, and for its architecture. It is the only known work of Charles Bulfinch for which a complete set of architectural drawings has survived. =2014 dome replacement= The Maine Legislature's Legislative Council has authorized the replacement of the copper sheath of the dome, which is long past its intended 75-year lifespan when it was installed in 1909–1910. The copper was pockmarked with hail damage and corrosion, with some holes in it as large as a dime. The eight-month project commenced in March 2014 and completed in October. The dome appears exactly the same as prior to renovations, with the exception of the color; it will appear brown for approximately 35 years until the copper oxidizes to a green once again. The statue of Minerva was also re-gilded and repaired by EverGreene Architectural Arts. The cost of $1.2 million was paid from a Legislative Council account. The replacement of the copper was completed October 1, with some minor work lasting until November. Legislative leaders placed a time capsule in the dome, containing a book of Maine laws, a legislative handbook, the September 30 issue of the Kennebec Journal, some of the old copper, and personal items from the legislators. 200x200px The Legislative Council debated what to do with the old copper roof once it was removed from the dome. The contract for the project originally called for the State to have salvage rights for of the old copper and the contractor to have rights to the remainder, which has an estimated value of $15,000. It had been suggested that the State may want to keep more of the copper in order to do more with it. Democratic Assistant Senate Majority Leader Anne Haskell has suggested that at least some of the copper could be sold or auctioned to Mainers who might want a memento of the building, such as former state workers or legislators. She also suggested some sort of contest could be held among artists for using the copper, perhaps as part of the State's \\"one percent for art\\" program. Republican Senate Minority Leader Michael Thibodeau stated his support for some sort of artistic use of the copper but expressed concern about how the copper would be stored, storage costs, and security. On September 24, the Council decided to purchase the of old copper from the contractor and will make some into souvenirs and sell about to artists for the making of art and the remainder will be scrapped. It is conservatively expected that the portion sold to artists will bring approximately $12,250 to the State, while the making of souvenirs will cost about $3,600. Legislative leaders believe the State could make more money than estimated.

The two figures on the right are the beginnings of Picasso's African period. Picasso's African Period, which lasted from 1906 to 1909, was the period when Pablo Picasso painted in a style which was strongly influenced by African sculpture, particularly traditional African masks and art of ancient Egypt, in addition to non-African influences; Iberian sculpture, Iberian schematic art, Paul Cézanne and El Greco. This proto-Cubist period following Picasso's Blue Period and Rose Period has also been called the Negro Period,Howells 2003, p. 66. or Black Period.Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University PressDouglas Cooper, The Cubist Epoch, London: Phaidon in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art & the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1970.  Context and period  Fang mask is similar in style to what Picasso encountered in Paris just prior to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. In the early 20th century, African artworks were being brought back to Paris museums in consequence of the expansion of the French empire into Sub-Saharan Africa. The press was abuzz with exaggerated stories of cannibalism and exotic tales about the African kingdom of Dahomey. The mistreatment of Africans in the Belgian Congo was exposed in Joseph Conrad's popular book Heart of Darkness. It was natural in this climate of African interest that Picasso would look towards African artworks as inspiration for some of his work; his interest was sparked by Henri Matisse who showed him a mask from the Dan people of Africa.Matisse may have purchased this piece from Emile Heymenn's shop of non-western artworks in Paris, see PabloPicasso.org. In May or June 1907, Picasso experienced a \\"revelation\\" while viewing African art at the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro.Picasso, Rubin, and Fluegel 1980, p. 87. Picasso's discovery of African art influenced the style of his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (begun in May 1907 and reworked in July of that year), especially in the treatment of the two figures on the right side of the composition. Picasso continued to develop a style derived from African, Egyptian and Iberian art before beginning the analytic cubism phase of his painting in 1910. Other works of Picasso's African Period include the Bust of a Woman (1907, in the National Gallery, Prague); Mother and Child (Summer 1907, Musée Picasso, Paris); Nude with Raised Arms (1907, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid, Spain); and Three Women (Summer 1908, Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg).  Controversy  In historical reflection, a few issues have been pointed out include questioning the origins of this genre of art for Picasso. Primitivism as an aesthetic was often used by Europeans borrowing from non-Western cultures. While it is clear Picasso was inspired heavily by aesthetics from cultures not his own many art historians and critics have argued that this sort of borrowing was a modernist expression. Art historian Kobena Mercer covers Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon in his book on black diasporic art titled Travel and See. He argues Picasso's stylistic change towards an African inspired aesthetic was individualistic and modern while minority artists receive little to no recognition for their work inspired by their own culture. It could also be as problematic that in Demoiselles d'Avignon the women painted wearing African-like masks are meant to be prostitutes from Barcelona's red-light district. Picasso masks these white bodies in order to make their sexualization acceptable to a European audience. Picasso himself though said about painting \\"It's not an aesthetic process; it's a form of magic that interposes itself between us and the hostile universe, a means of seizing power by imposing a form on our terrors as well as on our desires.\\" To him, these masks were a peoples' connection between themselves and the hostile universe he wanted his art to confront. In February of 2006, an exhibition titled \\"Picasso and Africa\\" showcasing Picasso's work from his African period as well as many African sculptures similar to ones he would have been inspired by where shown side by side in Johannesburg, South Africa at the Standard Bank Gallery. A curator involved in the exhibition, Marylin Martin quoted to an article for the Guardian \\"Picasso never copied African art, which is why this show does not match a specific African work with a Picasso\\", the goal of the exhibition was not to accuse Picasso of stealing but to show how he transcended it and created a new aesthetic combining his own and his inspiration. Whether or not Picasso's African period is cultural appropriation or controversial is a fairly new interpretation of his work. Opinions on it differ among art historians and critics. Some like Kobena Mercer argue that he takes away recognition from black diasporic artists while many consider it part of the trajectory of modernism in art and view it as an individualistic approach.

International career His Test debut came against India as a 21-year-old in 1978. He got his place in the side due to several of Australia's best players defecting to World Series Cricket. Later in the year he toured the West Indies and scored a century in the 1st Test as well as four half-centuries as he finished the Test series with the best run aggregate of 474 runs at 47.40. He maintained his place in the Australian cricket team for the majority of the early to mid-1980s. He was dropped after the disastrous Ashes tour of England in 1985. After excellent domestic form Wood was recalled in 1988/89 for the Test series against the West Indies. Wood scored 111 and 42 in the second Test, but was dropped after the third Test. Overall his best innings seemed to be against the West Indies, and the Australian selectors always seemed to recall him when a series against them was close. But after 1988 he never appeared in the Test side again. In first-class cricket, Wood scored 13,353 runs, making 35 centuries and 61 half centuries. As the captain of Western Australia he led the team to victory in three Sheffield Shield finals and another in the limited overs competition.

Rowland is best known for creating the American Girl brand. She is also notable for her efforts to redevelop historic properties in Aurora, New York, where she created a partnership with her alma mater Wells College. She has been married to philanthropist Jerome Frautschi since 1977. Frautschi's family owns Webcrafters printing company.  Early life and early career  Rowland was born in Chicago and grew up in Bannockburn, a suburb north of Chicago. She is the oldest of three sisters and a brother.Bill Glauber, \\"From dollhouse to doghouse\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 23, 2007 Her sister Barbara Whitney Carr is president of the Chicago Horticultural Society. Her father was Edward Thiele, a Chicago advertising executive who eventually became president of the Leo Burnett ad agency. After graduating from Wells College in 1962, Rowland embarked on the first of several careers. From 1962 to 1968, she was a schoolteacher in several states. She was a news reporter and anchor for the ABC station KGO-TV from 1968 to 1971. Rowland left that industry to pursue a career as a textbook writer. For several years she was involved in writing and publishing children's textbooks. She was also the publisher of the Children's Magazine Guide. In the 1970s, Rowland created a comprehensive language arts program, called Beginning to Read, Write, and Listen. It was informally known as the \\"letterbooks\\", and designed to be used for kindergarten and first grade students. Through the years the program has undergone several revisions and updates. In 1978, Rowland created Superkids with the aim of making reading education more effective for young students. Today, the Superkids Reading Program remains a phonics-based program that integrates reading, writing, spelling and grammar, and aligns with Common Core state standards. The reading program was purchased by education publisher Zaner-Bloser in 2015 and continues to be used in thousands of classrooms across the U.S.  Career  In 1986 Rowland founded the Pleasant Company, which manufactured the \\"American Girl\\" dolls, books and accessories. Rowland was inspired to create the American Girl brand because of her longstanding interest in history. A visit to Colonial Williamsburg led her to think that young girls might become interested in history through identifying with dolls based on historic periods. Each doll is designed with a story that places it in a specific historical time period. Books, clothing and other accessories are marketed separately for each doll. The company's growth was rapid as it added dolls, books, clothing for dolls and girls, and numerous other accessories, such as dollhouses and children's furniture. In marketing synergy, her company created stores in major cities, events, and films planned around the dolls and their accessories. For instance, parents may pay to reserve space at stores for American Girl parties for their daughters and friends. Stores have public restaurants where mothers and daughters can have tea or other meals. In 1998 Rowland sold the Pleasant Company (now American Girl) to Mattel for $700 million. Based in Middleton, Wisconsin, American Girl reached $350 million in sales in 2001. As of 2008, its US sales were second only to the Barbie doll. In 2001 Rowland purchased bankrupt retailer MacKenzie-Childs, based in Aurora, NY. After Rowland restructured the company's management team in 2006, MacKenzie-Childs became profitable. In 2008 Rowland sold MacKenzie-Childs to Lee Feldman and Howard Cohen – part owners of Twin Lakes Capital. In 2003 Rowland founded the nonprofit Rowland Reading Foundation to update and distribute The Superkids Reading Program and to support research into early reading instruction. On September 22, 2010 Rowland received an Honorary Doctoral Degree of Humane Letters from Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin. = Philanthropy = Rowland and husband Jerome Frautschi are major philanthropists in Madison, Wisconsin. Frautschi is from the Madison area, where his family has been based for several generations. They have made substantial contributions to Madison; together, they made one of the largest single contributions, a $205 million gift to build the Overture Center for the Arts, a performing arts center and museum. (Frautschi is said to have financed the project wholly with personal funds from the sale of his stock in American Girl.) = Awards and Honors = *Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, 1999 *The Jane Bradley Pettit Award for Distinction in Philanthropy, 2009 *Wisconsin Business Hall of Fame, 2010 *Wisconsin Governor's Award *Association of Educational Publishers’ Hall of Fame Citations External links  * Wells College biography of Pleasant Rowland * Pleasant Company biography for Pleasant Rowland * MacKenzie-Childs * CNN article on the Aurora controversy * Rowland Reading Foundation website Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:Writers from Chicago Category:Businesspeople from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Writers from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Wells College alumni Category:Philanthropists from Illinois Category:Toy inventors Category:American Girl ","title":"Pleasant Rowland"},{"id":"2491650","text":"Bentley, originally called Oxford, is a town in central, Alberta, Canada within Lacombe County.

Established in 1946, OMRF is dedicated to understanding and developing more effective treatments for human disease. Stephen M. Prescott serves as president of OMRF, which employs more than 500 scientific and administrative staff members. OMRF’s scientists, who include a member of the National Academy of Sciences, hold more than 700 U.S. and international patents and have spun off 11 biotech companies. Discoveries at OMRF led to Xigris, the first FDA- approved drug for the treatment of severe sepsis, and Ceprotin, a therapy for people suffering from a rare and life-threatening blood disorder known as protein C deficiency. Research at OMRF also identified the enzyme believed responsible for Alzheimer’s disease and laid the groundwork for OncoVue, a breast cancer risk assessment test. History Beginning from discussions among the alumni of the University of Oklahoma Medical School in 1944, several doctors began to develop the idea of an independent research organization adjacent to - but separate from - the medical school. Led by Dr. Mark R. Everett, a Harvard Medical School grad who rose from professor to become dean of the OU Medical School in 1947, they agreed on August 3, 1946 to incorporate as the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), a private, nonprofit, independent research institution in Oklahoma City. In April 1947 Oklahoma’s Governor, Roy J. Turner became general chair of a statewide fund drive for OMRF that spanned all 77 of Oklahoma’s counties. By May 1949, 7,000 Oklahomans had donated and pledged $2.35 million, and construction of OMRF began. The Foundation officially began operations on July 3, 1949. Sir Alexander Fleming, the British scientist who discovered penicillin, made his first visit to the United States to give the keynote address at the dedication. An estimated 2,500 people attended the ceremonies, where Fleming pronounced the future \\"bright,\\" even though the first building was at the time, in the Nobel laureate’s words, \\"just a big hole in the ground.\\". Dr. Edward C. Reifenstein, Jr., became the Foundation’s first director. OMRF opened the doors of its first building on Dec. 17, 1950. Since that time, OMRF has grown from 5 principal scientists to 50, and its staff has grown from roughly two dozen employees to almost 500. Securing more than $30 million annually in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health and other granting agencies, OMRF is a member of the Association of Independent Research Institutes. Its scientists focus on research in the areas of immunology, cardiovascular biology and diseases of aging. ResearchAlzheimer’s and brain diseases= In 2000, Jordan J.N. Tang and colleagues created an inhibitor that, in vitro, stopped the enzyme thought to cause Alzheimer's disease. The biotechnology company CoMentis has since built on that discovery to create an experimental drug for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. In 2007, Tang uncovered a molecular mechanism that links an Alzheimer’s susceptibility gene (known as E4) to the process of disease onset. In OMRF’s free radical biology and aging research program, Robert A. Floyd leads a team of scientists who focus on the mechanisms that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease). =Cancer and immunobiology= Technology developed in the laboratories of Eldon Jupe and Linda F. Thompson led to the creation of a test for assessing breast cancer risk in women. Marketed as OncoVue, the test is produced by Intergenetics, Inc., and available in clinics the U.S. Paul W. Kincade leads a group of immunologists in the study of the causes of lymphomas, leukemias and myelomas. With a research-grade magnetic resonance imaging facility, OMRF scientists are developing methods of using MRI to speed the process of identifying and treating brain, liver and bladder cancers. In 2006, molecular biologist Gary J. Gorbsky and his lab were the first to reverse the process of cell division, a discovery detailed in the journal Nature that may have implications for the prevention and treatment of cancer and birth defects. =Heart and blood diseases= Led by Rodger P. McEver and Charles T. Esmon OMRF’s cardiovascular biology research program works to pinpoint the origins of cardiovascular disease. Esmon’s research has led to the development of two FDA-approved drugs: Xigris, a treatment for severe sepsis (blood poisoning), and Ceprotin, a therapy for children suffering from life-threatening blood-clotting complications. =Lupus and autoimmune diseases= OMRF’s largest research program is dedicated to the study and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases Autoimmune disease. Led by physician-researchers Judith A. James Robert Scofield and Morris Reichlin this group has identified antibodies that appear in the blood years before the clinical onset of lupus. They also are studying the role a common virus may play in triggering lupus. Their work led the National Institutes of Health to establish the Lupus Family Registry and Repository at OMRF. The LFRR is a resource that scientists worldwide can use in their own lupus research. The collection includes DNA, sera, plasma, and data from systemic lupus patients, first degree relatives, and healthy volunteers. Study participation involves completing paperwork and donating a one-time blood sample. Education programs In 1956, OMRF established its Sir Alexander Fleming Scholar Program, a summer research training program for Oklahoma high school and college students. The 'Teen Leaders in Philanthropy' class was created in 2012 to let up to 40 high school sophomores, juniors and seniors develop hands-on leadership skills and an understanding of what a nonprofit organization does. The program gives participants a chance to learn from a variety of charitable organizations, donors and volunteers during nine sessions throughout the school year. OMRF also provides the training ground for graduate and postdoctoral students each year in the M.D./Ph.D Program at the University of Oklahoma Medical School. Core facilities OMRF maintains numerous core facilities, including: *A 7-tesla MRI, which uses a 10,000-pound magnet to generate a magnetic field that is 140,000 times stronger than the earth’s and allows researchers to study the cells and organs of genetically engineered living mice and rats at microscopic levels without harming the animals; *BIACore to measure affinity and binding kinetics of macromolecular interactions; *DNA Sequencing, with the daily capacity to run 90 sequences; *Flow Cytometry, with three instruments: the FACScan and FACSCalibur cytometers, capable of three and four color fluorescence analyses, and the MoFlo cytometer capable of high throughput cell sorting.; *Imaging, to assist researchers with imaging needs ranging from basic light and electron microscopy to digital image processing and analysis; *In Situ Hybridization, including tissue sectioning, slide mounting, and hybridization histochemistry; *Mouse Genome Manipulation Facility, providing microinjection services of DNA into zygotes for the generation of transgenic mice, and of ES cells into blastocysts for the generation of knockout mice; *Molecular Biology Resource Facility, for protein and peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis; and *Signal Transduction Core, to assist research involving intracellular Ca2+ measurements and protein-protein interactions. In society OMRF is funded through grants and independent contributions. One of the more unusual contributions is a share in the royalties of the musical Oklahoma!. Lynn Riggs wrote one of the play's songs, “Green Grow the Lilacs.” When he died, he willed his 1% royalty to his 4 siblings. When his brother William Edgar Riggs died, OMRF received rights to that one-quarter share. As of the end of 2018, it has generated over $700,000 in earnings.

Lamb earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1958 and taught there from 1956 to 1964. His dissertation was a grammar of the Uto-Aztecan language Mono, under the direction of Mary Haas and Murray B. Emeneau.Lamb, Sydney. A Grammar of Mono. PhD. Dissertation. Berkeley, 1958. In 1964, he began teaching at Yale University before joining the Semionics Associates in Berkeley, California in 1977. Lamb did research in North American Indian languages specifically in those geographically centered on California. His contributions have been wide- ranging, including those to historical linguistics, computational linguistics, and the theory of linguistic structure. His work led to innovative designs of content-addressable memory hardware for microcomputers. Lamb is best known as the father of the relational network theory of language, which is also known as \\"stratificational theory\\". Near the turn of the millennium, he began developing the theory further and exploring its possible relationships to neurological structures and to thinking processes. His early work developed the notion of \\"sememe\\" as a semantic object, analogous to the morpheme or phoneme in linguistics; it was one of the inspirations of Roger Schank's Conceptual dependency theory, a methodology for representing language meaning directly within the Artificial Intelligence movement of the 1960s/1970s.

The Panther Story. Panther Publishing Ltd., 1999, p. 1. They became identified with one particular design of motorcycle which had a large sloping 40-degree single-cylinder engine as a stressed member of the frame. This design spanned the entire history of the company, starting with a 500 cc model and ending with a 645 cc model. The sloping stressed member concept was patented in 1900 by Joah (\\"John\\") Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner. Phelon & Rayner made the first chain-driven motorcycle in 1900. They could not afford to put their first bike into production, so sold the design to Humber for royalties, and that design was produced by Humber till 1907. After Harry Rayner died in a car accident, Joah Phelon went into partnership with Richard Moore. P&M; motorcycles Phelon & Moore was established in 1904, and their motorcycles were branded as P&M.; The 1905 P&M; featured an inclined single cylinder 4-stroke engine as a stressed member in the frame with 2-speed gear and chain drive to the rear wheel,\\"Evolution of the motor cycle\\", Motor Cycle magazine, 1 June 1922, pp. 700–706 it being the 'first completely chain driven motor cycle'.\\"Motor Cycles at the Scottish Show\\", Motor Cycle magazine, 26 January 1922, p123 P&M; motorcycles competed in the first International Six Days Trial (ISDT) in 1913 (now called the International Six Days Enduro).

Dorey, The Technical Publishing Company The four speed gear arrangement used on the V-twins was re-introduced for the single in 1922, and at the same time the engine capacity was increased from 499cc to 555cc.

P&M; were also selected as the suppliers when the RAC added sidecars to their range of vehicles in 1922.Motor Cycle magazine, 30 March 1922, p416 Panther motorcycles Panther motorcycle Panther 100 1951 The first Panther was launched in 1924, but the Phelon & Moore name was not dropped until somewhere around 1929. In 1932 the Panther Model 100, an OHV 600 cc single, was launched and this was produced through to the sixties, ending its run as the 645 cc Panther Model 120 of 1967. This line of Panthers was the most famous of all Phelon & Moore models. These heavyweight big single-cylinder \\"slopers\\" were often described as \\"firing once every lamp-post\\" due to their low rpm. Promoted as \\"The Perfected Motorcycle\\" they were noted for innovation for most of their history. Panthers were often used for hauling sidecars, a role in which the high torque output of a high capacity single-cylinder engine with its large flywheels was well suited, but the popularity of sidecar outfits eventually waned. The combination of the advent of cheap cars and the collapse of the British motorcycle industry brought production to an end. They are simple and fairly robust machines which inspire enormous enthusiasm in their owners. These factors, combined with relatively low cost, have resulted in a fair number of Panthers being still in use. Phelon & Moore also produced a range of lightweight machines, also generally carrying the name Panther or Red Panther, using their own four-stroke single engines and Villiers two-stroke engines. The Red Panther was famous for being the cheapest complete bike available in the thirties, priced at a fraction under £30. In 1934 a 250 cc Red Panther won the Maudes Trophy. The early postwar models (both Lightweight and Heavyweight) were fitted with air/oil damped Dowty \\"Oleomatic\\" telescopic forks During the scooter boom of the late 1950s, P & M imported a scooter (Scooterrot) and moped from French manufacturer Terrot, which were plagued with troubles. This gave P & M the chance to develop their own scooter, the Panther Princess, but this was not a success and helped bring about the demise of P & M as motorcycle manufacturers. In 1962 the receiver was called in, and production staggered on until 1966.

It has 214 seats and members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. 20% of the seats are reserved for the opposition. Elections are held in the last 30 days of each five-year term. To be eligible for office, one must be a voter with a Tunisian mother or father and be at least 23 years old the day candidacy is announced. The last election to the Chamber of Deputies was held in October 2009. Under the original Tunisian constitution, the Chamber of Deputies theoretically possessed great lawmaking powers, and even had the right to censure the government by a two-thirds majority. In practice, the body was dominated by the Democratic Constitutional Rally (formerly the Neo-Destour Party and Socialist Destour Party) from independence until the 2011 Tunisian revolution. The Neo-Destour won every seat in the Chamber at the first elections in 1959. From then on, Tunisia was effectively a one-party state, even though opposition parties nominally remained legal until 1963. Even after opposition parties were legalized again in 1981, they did not manage to enter the Chamber of Deputies until 1994. Even then, in the five elections held before the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, they never accounted for more than 19 percent of the total seats in the chamber. During the last few years of Ben Ali's tenure, the chamber took an increased role in debating national policy. However, all legislation still originated with the president, and there was little meaningful opposition to presidential decisions. After the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the Chamber of Deputies was replaced by the Assembly of the Representatives of the People as Tunisia's legislature.

HistoryConstruction= The airport was built in the 1980s and then developed in the 1980s by the Iraqi Government department State Organisation for Roads and Bridges (SORB) as a gateway to the only port in Iraq. This second phase of development was completed by a joint venture comprising Strabag Bau AG of Cologne, Billfinger & Berger of Manheim both in Germany and Universale of Austria in Spring 1988. It is claimed that the airport was built only as a facility for VIPs and was only used rarely. =Renovation and military use= Renovation of the airport was supposed to proceed with the construction of a new terminal under German contract but the project prematurely ceased with the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War. Actual development proceeded in the airport only after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Some facilities were refurbished under a contract by United States Agency for International Development. The project is broad as it includes building air traffic control towers and other navigational facilities, as well as the construction of transportation and communications facilities. The airport was eventually reopened in June 2004. The event was marked by the traditional sheep sacrifice as an Iraqi Airways Boeing 727 jet landed from Baghdad. It was the beginning of a new domestic service in Iraq between Baghdad and Basrah. However, many of the passengers complained about the lack of basic facilities. Problems included air conditioning and toilets. Reconstruction of the airport is still under way to improve the facilities. Iraqi Airways has already operated routes from this airport, and was its second hub. Between 2003 and 2009 there was a significant Royal Air Force presence at the airport as No. 903 Expeditionary Air Wing was deployed here with a variety of fixed-wing and rotary such as: Fixed-wing * Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.2 * Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules C.4 & C.5 * British Aerospace 125 Rotary * Boeing Chinook HC.2 * Westland Sea King HC.4 * Westland Lynx AH.7/AH.9 * Westland Gazelle AH.1 * Westland Puma HC.1 * Westland Merlin HC.3 The unit was re-deployed to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan during mid 2009. The United States army has also deployed a number of aircraft to Basra irregularly: * Boeing AH-64 Apache The Danish Air Force also deployed some aircraft: * Eurocopter Squirrel Airlines and destinationsGround operations Following the American control and since 2002, SkyLink Arabia has been providing ground operations and fuel supply at the airport. In 2014 Group holding services with its subsidiary Basra ground handling services company with the partnership of Iraq airways took over the ground handling operations at the airport. During 2010 access to the airport was strictly controlled by checkpoints situated at the main Airport entrance. Navigating this was done strictly on the production of a flight reference number for outward travel. The US Government (USG), accommodated at the adjacent US Consulate, required dedicated transfer services from the Consulate to the Airport terminal. A newly established company, Personal Transition Services (PTS), was contracted by several of the USG elements to perform this service. The company started by providing services directly to and from the Airport, but quickly grew into a company that provide full life support services further to the south close to the Iraq/Kuwait border at Safwan. PTS became the first International company to have a desk inside the main Airport terminal, from where the locally employed staff were able to provide both English and Iraqi speaking services.

Her songs are known for their sultry and suggestive lyrics. She tours and records with her band, the Zydeco Playboys.  Biography  Raised in rural Louisiana, Ledet listened to rock music in her youth. Although she was in an environment where zydeco was heard, she took little interest in the music at the time. She first became fascinated with zydeco music when she was 16 years old. She attended a zydeco dance at Richard's, a famous zydeco club in Lawtell, Louisiana, and saw Boozoo Chavis play, which inspired her to start learning to play zydeco. At this dance, she also met Morris Ledet, her husband to be. She learned the accordion watching Morris play. When he heard her, he stepped aside allowing her the spotlight, and became her accompanist on the bass guitar. Morris, then brought Rosie to his producer, Mike Lachney, also known as DJ BAD WEATHER, a veteran zydeco producer. Mike was so impressed, that he quickly set up a recording session. Mike then took Rosie to Floyd Soileau, of Maison de Soul label. Floyd also was impressed and gave Mike a contract to produce five albums on Rosie.

Originally released solely in French, it has since been translated into many other languages. The game includes both pay-to-play accounts offering the full experience and free- to-play accounts offering a more limited amount of content. Its success has led to the marketing of spin-off products, such as books, art, comics and a movie released in 2016. It has also led to the development of two continuations: Dofus Arena, released at the beginning of 2006, which is an alternative \\"tournament\\" version of Dofus; and Wakfu, a continuation of Dofus. The game has attracted over 40 million players worldwide and is especially well known in France. PlotContext= Dofus takes place in the World of Twelve, a heroic-fantasy universe. Players must find six primordial Dofus, dragon eggs conferring great power on their bearer, which are scattered around the world. The game, in the open world, gives way to the free will of the players, who can choose to orient themselves in the Players against Players, Players against Monsters or the economy. =Universe= Dofus is the first Ankama product to take place in the transmedia world of the Krosmoz. From this first success will appear many derivative products, including two other video games, Arena in 2011 then Wakfu the following year, and television (Wakfu, Dofus: Aux trésors de Kerubim) and cinematographic (Dofus, book 1: Julith). The first derivative work is the manfra Dofus, the first volume of which was released in October 200510. It is written by Tot, co-creator of the game, and drawn by Ancestral Z. Gameplay Dofus takes place in \\"The World of Twelve\\", named for the 12 gods that inhabit it. Players control a 2D avatar belonging to one of 18 character classes in a third-person view. Each class has a unique set of spells that other classes can not obtain. As with most other massively multiplayer online role-playing games, players gain levels by obtaining experience. Experience can be gained by defeating monsters and completing quests. With each level, players gain points that can be used to improve their avatar's characteristics and spells. Players can access new spells and equipment by advancing in level. Players receive a special 'aura' when they reach level 100, and gain a different aura at 200, the maximum level. Players may also decide to take up professions and frequently band together to undertake dungeons. Many also become part of guilds, to more easily coordinate with others. Players complete quests to gain experience and other rewards. While the game takes place in real-time, combat in Dofus is conducted more like a turn based strategy game – where each player takes it in turns to make a series of moves and attacks within a time limit. As such, when a player attacks monsters – they are transported to a 'copy map' where the fighting takes place. Once a fight begins, no other players may join that fight. Players use a series of spells (which are unique to that character class) to, amongst other effects, attack, heal, buff or drain one's Action Points (AP) or Movement Points (MP). All actions done in combat (by both players and monsters) consumes an amount of AP and all movement consumes MP. In combat if a character loses all of their health points (HP) they're rendered dead. Characters in Dofus can learn various professions. There is a special type of profession called a specialization which can enhance item stats. Collecting professions involve players going out into the wilderness and collecting natural resources, such as certain wood and flowers. These can be made into breads and the like that restore health. They may also be sold as many of them are needed as quests items. Crafting professions involve the player piecing collected resources together to make a vast array of different items. Players gain experience in each profession by gathering the resources of that profession and/or by crafting items, depending on the type. As a player's collecting profession gains levels, they can collect new types of resources and obtain resources quickly. When a crafting profession levels, the player can create more powerful items and create them with a higher success rate, meaning that crafting will fail less often. The currency used in Dofus is called \\"Kamas\\" (k). There are three cities that contain a marketplace where people can buy and sell goods and equipment for a fee. The kamas from these sales deposit directly into the player's bank account. Accounts are separated into two categories, Free-to-Play and Pay-to-Play. The game includes a zone accessible to Free-to-Play accounts. Free accounts have access to the new player zone of Incarnam and access to the city of Astrub and most of its outlying areas. This makes it possible for a new player to enjoy seemingly full game play, unbounded by time restrictions. Access to the entire world of Dofus—including access to other cities, participating in factional Player vs. Player battles and being able to raise profession levels above 30—requires a monthly fee, with discounts given for longer term subscriptions.

Animated series In 2013 an animated series entitled Dofus aux trésors de Kérubim (English: Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim) based upon the game began airing on France 3. The series is set 200 years before the beginning of the MMORPG and follows the character of Kerubim throughout various points in his life. The premise has Kerubim narrating several of his adventures to his adopted son Joris and their housekeeper Simone. Dofus consists of 52 episodes, each running 13 minutes apiece. The movie Dofus Book I: Julith was released on February 3, 2016. An English dub of the series debuted in the United States on VRV in November 2017. It was removed in late-2019. = Main Characters = * Kerub Crepin - Kerub takes the leading role as head of the house, father figure, shop keeper and storyteller. Most episodes focus on stories of his past, and he often maintains the leading role in present-day episodes as well. Through his many stories, viewers get to know him as a child, a teenager and an adventurer in his prime. These different periods of heroism, conquest and bravado are contrasted by his current wisdom, melancholy and care for Joris. Having left many flaws in his past, he often delivers morals to Joris, but he still displays mischief and other traits that children may identify with. * Joris - Joris, 7 years old, is the second focus of the series, a young boy whom the target audience can relate to with his mischief, disdain for chores and love of stories and (child-scale) adventures. He is always pressing his \\"Papycha\\" for more stories, asking about the various magic items in the shop, all of which were acquired through adventuring. He is very curious and obedient and clearly loves his adoptive father. His pet flea Flifli is often helpful in situations of need, frequently acting like a guard dog. * Simone - Simone is an Osamodas maid that is hired by Kerub in the second episode, although her arrival is based on a misunderstanding. Although she plays a secondary role in most episodes, she becomes a member of the family after a fashion despite being aloof toward most people, with the notable exception of Joris, with whom she sometimes behaves like a nanny. She also befriends Luis quickly, which allows her to set both the house and the household straight. She develops a romantic relationship with a local Ecaflip hairdresser named Julie, but her sexual orientation is never treated as out of the ordinary or used to make a point. Despite working as a maid, she is fearsome in a fight and secretive about her past. * Lou - Lou is the lifelong love interest of Kerub, and also a capable adventurer in adulthood. Featuring in many episodes focused on the past, the Ouginak is sometimes seen as a prize, sometimes as a companion, and sometimes as a disgruntled lover to win back. Her strong temperament often clashes with Kerub's exuberant and carefree attitude, but his love for her is never diminished. She, on the other hand, seems to have left him for good and is never seen in the present day. * Indie Delagrandaventure - The Ouginak Indie Delagrandaventure is Kerub's greatest rival. Similar in many ways, yet perfect opposites in others, they have spent their whole lives competing to determine who was the greatest adventurer. In their youth, they also competed for the love of Lou, but neither of them truly won that competition. Where Kerub relies heavily on luck and persuasion, Indie owes his success entirely to skill and discipline. He sees himself as a gentleman adventurer, refined and respectable, and Kerub as a \\"stray\\" merely playing at being a hero. = Supporting Characters = * Luis - As the living house where current-day events take place, the Shushu Luis is mostly involved in conversation, but he also has control over various parts of the house and can use doors, among other things, to hinder or assist Kerub depending on his mood. One episode is dedicated to showing how Kerub and Lou came into \\"possession\\" of him. * Ecaflip - As Kerub was raised in Ecaflip's temple and became his favorite disciple, the god Ecaflip makes several appearances throughout the series, influencing his luck, watching over him or placing challenges in his way. *Julie - Julie is a local Ecaflip hairdresser. She is revealed to be a lesbian as she falls for Simone the minute she sees her during Episode 1.\\"\\"Kerubim\\"\\". Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim. Episode 1. January 5, 2013. They develop a romantic relationship and are always seen together going on dates. * Crocosec - Crocosec has an uncanny gift for disguise that is nothing short of unbelievable, which made him a valuable asset as part of Kerub's old crew. Unfortunately, he also feels uncontrollable urges to betray his allies at the worst times, but the others seem to accept his handicap rather gracefully. * Kanigroo - Kanigroo is an expert tracker with a zen attitude, who never resorts to violence despite his impressive strength. His extraordinary sense of smell also allows him to detect lies. * Tortue Brutale - This excitable member of Kerub's old crew has a fascination for explosives that needs to be kept in check by his friends, but his expertise on weaponry is equally valuable. He usually handles the more technical part of their operations. * Bash Squale - Although he and Kerub used to be best friends, Bash has never forgiven Kerub for his perceived betrayal (episode 7). As he lives close by, Kerub often tries to be cordial with him, but his efforts seem wasted, to his chagrin.

He was a professor at Stanford University from 1911 until 1932. Among many other posts, Townley served as an instructor of astronomy at the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley he was also the president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1916. Throughout the course of his career he published around 100 academic papers and edited many more, he was recognized for his excellent editorial skills.  Early life and education  Townley was born on April 10, 1867 in Waukesha, Wisconsin to Reverend Robert Townley and his wife Mary Wilkinson. After the equivalent of a high school education in 1885, he gained a job as a clerk in the local town bank. A year and a half later he was admitted to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During his second year at the university he took a course in astronomy. He was also given a room at the Washburn Observatory and worked nights as an assistant. These would serve to shape his interest in astronomy. He studied astronomy under George Comstock. In his second year as a graduate student he was offered a Hearst fellowship at the Lick Observatory, which he accepted, arriving in 1892. In 1893, however, the fellowship funds were re-committed to an eclipse expedition to Chile, so he had to depart. He would graduate with a B.S. degree in 1891 with distinction, and become a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation that same year he visited his brother living in California, which made him interested in Lick Observatory.  Career  He became an instructor of astronomy, first at the University of Michigan, later followed by the University of California. From 1893 until 1898 he worked at the Detroit Observatory, where he studied variable stars and comets. By 1897, he gained his Sc.D. from the University of Michigan with a thesis on the \\"Orbit of Psyche\\". In 1896, he spent a year on- leave to travel through Germany, visiting major observatories in Berlin, Leipzig, and Munich. After his return from his travels he began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, under Armin Otto Leuschner. He was later appointed director of the International Latitude Station at Ukiah, California. While there he developed an interest in geodesy, particularly seismology. Townley was a member of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific during its early years and served as its president in 1916, and also spent time as director and on the publication committee. He also joined the Seismological Society, and served at various times as president, secretary- treasurer, and editor of the society journal. In 1911 he became an assistant professor at Stanford University. By 1918, he became full professor, and would remain in that position until his retirement in 1932, thereafter becoming professor emeritus.  Death and legacy  Toward the end of his life he became an invalid, although he remained mentally alert until he died. He died March 18, 1946 at Stanford, California. During his career he published roughly 100 academic papers, and edited the contributions of many others. He was widely recognized for his editorial skills. The crater Townley on the Moon is named after Townley.  Private life  He married Frances May Wright on January 7, 1895 in Oregon. Together they had three daughters and at the time of retirement lived in Palo Alto, California. His daughter Lucile Townley Clark, married architect, Birge Clark. Birge Clark's father was architect and Stanford University design professor Arthur Bridgman Clark who designed the Townley's residence at 613 Salvatierra (now 661 Cabrillo Avenue; built 1921) in Stanford, California. Another daughter, Isabel Townley Marx married the son of Stanford University mechanical engineering professor Guido Hugo Marx.

Rather than having a separate filter for removing the toxic chemicals, they consisted of a gas-permeable hood worn over the head which was treated with chemicals. The P (or Phenate) Helmet, officially called the Tube Helmet, appeared in July 1915, replacing the simpler Hypo Helmet. It featured two mica eyepieces instead of the single visor of its predecessor, and added an exhale valve fed from a metal tube which the wearer held in his mouth. The exhale valve was needed because a double layer of flannel – one treated and one not – was needed because the solution attacked the fabric. It had flannel layers of cloth-dipped in sodium phenolate and glycerin and protected against chlorine and phosgene, but not against tear gas. Around 9 million were made. The PH Helmet (Phenate Hexamine) replaced it in October 1915, and added hexamethylene tetramine, which greatly improved protection against phosgeneThe Riddle of the Rhine: Chemical Strategy in Peace and War, Victor LeFebure, at Project Gutenberg and added protection against hydrocyanic acid. Around 14 million were made and it remained in service until the end of the war by which time it was relegated to second line use. The PHG Helmet appeared in January 1916 and was similar to the PH Helmet but had a facepiece made of rubber sponge to add protection against tear gas. Around one and a half million were produced in 1916–1917. It was finally superseded by the Small box respirator in 1916, which was much more satisfactory against high concentrations of phosgene or lachrymators.

History Edward Maynard was born in Madison, New York, on April 26, 1813. In 1831 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point but resigned after only a semester due to ill health and became a dentist in 1835. Maynard continued to practice dentistry for the rest of his life, becoming one of the most prominent dentists in the United States. Practicing in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., his clientele included the country's political elite, including Congressmen and Presidents, and it is reported that he was offered but declined the position of Imperial Dentist to Tsar Nicholas I. In 1857 he became professor of theory and practice in Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. Maynard had two wives; his first was Sophia Ellen Doty (born 1826, and to which all of his known children were born) and Nellie Long (born 1845). Maynard's son, George Willoughby Maynard, was born in Washington, D. C. on March 5, 1843, and became a successful artist. His other children included John (born 1855), Ellen (born 1858), Josephine (born 1860), Marie (born 1852), Virginia (born 1854), and Edna (born 1870).1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 US Federal Census In 1845 Maynard patented the first of 23 firearms-related patents he was awarded during his life. In 1888 he held the chair of Dental Theory and Practice at the National university in Washington. He died in Washington on May 4, 1891, and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery. Firearms inventions Maynard invented many dental methods and instruments, but is most famous for his firearms inventions. He achieved lucrative fame for his first patent, an 1845 priming system which cycled a small mercury fulminate charge to the nipple of a percussion cap firearm. His system used a magazine from which a paper roll, not unlike modern cap guns, advanced a charge over the nipple as the gun was cocked; this was intended to accelerate the gun's rate of fire as the shooter could concentrate on loading and firing the gun. The system was quickly adopted by several commercial gun makers, and the United States government decided to test it. In 1845 the Maynard system was installed on 300 converted percussion muskets and trials were considered successful. Maynard turned over the patent rights to his priming system to the United States Federal Government in exchange for a royalty of $1.00 per weapon: a substantial sum at the time (the cost of making an entire 1861 Springfield was $18.00.) In 1855 the Maynard Tape Primer System was installed on all 1855 model .58 caliber military rifles and carbines made at Federal arsenals. The base of an unfired Maynard 52 caliber cartridge showing the hole in the middle of the base However the system was complicated and often malfunctioned in wartime conditions. During the Crimean War British cavalrymen had been equipped with 2,000 Greene carbines, a Maynard system firearm, and the system was found to be unreliable in the field. In 1860 U.S. ordnance officers recommended dropping the Maynard Tape Primer System, and the famous 1861 Springfield rifled muskets did not use it. In 1851, however, Maynard had patented a more successful idea: a simple lever-operated breechloading rifle, which used a metallic cartridge his own invention. When the gun's lever was depressed the barrel rose, opening the breech for loading. Afterwards the lever was raised to close the gun's breech. Once cocked the loaded weapon could be primed by either placing a percussion cap directly on its nipple or by using Maynard's priming system to advance a primer to the nipple. The brass Maynard cartridge did not have an integral percussion cap; a small hole in the middle of its base fired it when the external cap was detonated. The cartridge, which had a wide rim permitting swift extraction, was reloadable up to 100 times. This was of particular advantage to the Confederacy, as the cartridges could be manufactured without the sophisticated equipment that the south generally lacked. Another significant feature was that the use of a metallic cartridge prevented gas escape at the breech, a serious concern for early externally primed breechloaders. Production The Springfield Armory manufactured a sample Maynard carbine in .48 caliber and it was tested in May 1856. The gun, fired at ranges from 100 to 500 yards, was considered the best breechloader tested. Subsequently, the cartridge's powder charge was raised from 30 to 40 grains, loaded behind a 343-grain lubricated bullet. Maynard and his financial backers founded the Maynard Arms Company in 1857, contracting the Massachusetts Arms Company to manufacture the new gun for civilian and military use. The guns, known as Maynards, were offered in .35 and .50 caliber, and could be purchased with interchangeable smoothbore shotgun barrels. A second army test resulted in a military contract for four hundred .50 caliber Maynard carbines, with the original long-range aperture tang sight replaced with a barrel mounted open sight. The Revenue Cutter Service (later the United States Coast Guard) and United States Navy ordered smaller numbers. The Maynard was highly praised in frontier service, but only four U.S. regiments appear to have been armed with the first model Maynard during the American Civil War. Between 1861 and 1863 only the 1st (later 4th) U.S., 9th Pennsylvania, and 1st Wisconsin Cavalry received the gun. This may have been because the Massachusetts Arms Company's factory burned down in January 1861. Rebuilt by 1863 the factory began producing 20,000 of the simpler Second Model Maynard carbines for the U.S. government but deliveries did not begin until June 1864, continuing through May 1865. As a result, few of the second model Maynards saw service, although some reached the 9th and 11th Indiana regiments and the 11th Tennessee Cavalry. Some Southern states had purchased Maynards for their state militias in late 1860 and early 1861. About 3000 Maynards were in Southern hands during the war, mostly in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi units. The First Model Maynard was listed as an official firearm in Confederate ordnance manuals. The Maynard had a good reputation for long range accuracy and Confederate sharpshooters made extensive use of it, especially during the Siege of Charleston. Maynard cartridges were easily manufactured in the Confederacy, in contrast to the complex internally primed rimfire cartridges of captured Spencer and Henry rifles. The Maynard was easily adaptable to these newer cartridges and it was one of the few patent breechloaders to survive the Civil War. It continued in production as a highly regarded centerfire target and hunting rifle until 1890.

Diffusion Piece in J. Hood Wright Park overlooking the George Washington Bridge. The latter is the subject of a New York City official historical sign.NYC Parks, NYC Parks. The artist is an NEA-laureate with creations in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Australia, NYC Parks, and several museums. His art at times led to tangles with the House Un-American Activities Committee, the New York City Department of Buildings, and magazine \\"Art in America\\". He was co-organizer of the Fulcrum Gallery (AKA Fvlcrvm Gallery, AKA Shakespeare's Fvlcrvm) located in the basement of the SoHo Branch of the Guggenheim Museum until both sites closed in 2002 in part due to the economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks on SoHo and TriBeCa. Early life According to his own autobiography, It's the Artists' Life for Me!, he was born with the name Raymond Terry Fugate in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and he never met his father (who was KIA during World War II). At age sixteen, Raymond was formally adopted by his stepfather, Dale Wilcox, becoming Raymond Terry Fugate-Wilcox. He attended military schools and some college. His autobiography also says that he married in 1963 to Valerie Monroe Shakespeare who convinced him to drop Raymond from his name; changing his name to Terry Fugate-Wilcox. Fugate-Wilcox and wife moved to New York City in December 1968. WorkDiffusing metal sculptures= Consistent with the artist's enthusiasm for the Actual Art concept that time and natural process should be able to change art's appearance, the most recognizable Fugate-Wilcox pieces involve same-sized flat rectangular slabs of chemically sensitive metals which are physically bolted together—with the intent that, over time (an estimated year indicated in the piece's title) the slabs would chemically bond together through diffusion or other means into one solid mass. Such pieces include the National Gallery of Australia's 2,500 A.D. (Cu & Zn), and Cu & C (3500 ad), and also Blue steel & brass (2500 ad) New York City's prominent 1974 outdoor sculpture, 3000 A.D. Diffusion Piece is such a work: in theory, the piece's various aluminum and magnesium slabs will join themselves into one continuous alloy block around the year 3000. (The geo-coordinates of the site of the 3000 A.D. Diffusion Piece are: 40.847283,-73.94205.) =Other sculpture= Fugate- Wilcox concrete sculptures typically consist of flat slabs of concrete in the elemental polygonal shapes so often favored by minimalist artists. Fugate- Wilcox peppers the exposed surfaces of the still-wet concrete with metallic powder or other substances likely to oxidize or otherwise chemically change with the passage of time, thus changing the surface colors.[Seeman, Helene.\\"Art at Gateway Center, 2nd Annual Sculpture Exhibit,\\" Newark, Cat, 7/1991, illust.] The artist's Weathering Triangle outdoor sculpture in New York City was meant to feature the changing colors brought about by chemical reactions over time; however, Smithsonian photos Smithsonian (ref# IAS 87870227), Smithsonian. show that in fact the surface was usually just covered-over by unauthorized event posters and graffiti. (The piece was also a long-time \\"litigating triangle\\" as NY Buildings repeatedly fought to challenge in court the Triangle's erection without permits.) Some Fugate-Wilcox flat steel creations have involved changes created by blast effects from explosives. The warping and spalling resulting from contact with detonating explosives is used for artistic effect. Fugate-Wilcox also designs lightning- modified art. Some of the artist's creations use furnace-burnt or otherwise deweaponized handguns obtained from municipal gun buyback programs. Some sculptures have used bundles of vertically installed 2 by 4 lumber which would gradually fan-out slightly from their original rigidly compact vertical formation due to the swelling and warping effects of humidity. According to a 1983 New York Times article, a Fugate-Wilcox warping wood piece called Weathering Wood took advantage of variations in humidity to flex and \\"flower out\\" when dry, and then \\"close back up\\" when the environment became more humid.[Glueck, Grace. \\"Art, A Huge Exhibition at Brooklyn Terminal\\", The New York Times 9/30/1983, illust.] A future sculptural design for which the artist acquired land and started a nonprofit organization to raise funds is his San Andreas Fault Sculpture Project: a proposed monolith of concrete () meant to straddle both sides of the San Andreas Fault so that over time the Earth's own plate-tectonic forces will crack the block into two golden rectangles that will continue to move past each other in opposite directions.[Frankenstein, Alfred.\\"Crack in the World\\", San Francisco Examiner, Jan. 1, 1976, p.27, illust.][Walker, Michael. \\"Tectonics, The Crack-up\\", Los Angeles Times Magazine, Dec. 3, 1995, illust][Smith, Howard & B. Van Der Horst Scenes \\"A Slab in Time\\", Village Voice,6-30-'75, p.16, illust.] The artist's intent would be to use \\"the Earth itself, as a tool to make the movement of massive continents visible on a scale that can be understood in human terms\\".[Savitt, Mark, \\"Terry Fugate-Wilcox\\", Arts Magazine, Dec. 1975, p.10, illust][Bartelme, Margaret. \\"The San Andreas Fault\\", Art Week, Vol. 6-45, Vol. 7-1, 11/27/'75 & 1/3/’76, Illust.] =Paintings= Consistent with the artist's \\"Actual Art\\" philosophy, Fugate-Wilcox's abstract paintings often include in their creation, certain natural processes like weathering, rainfall evidence, or oxidation over time; sometimes the natural processes will (on purpose) cause additional colors to appear upon a once-monochromatic surface. A notable example seen by millions of New York City motorists (during the decade or so it was installed) was the outdoor mural titled Holland Tunnel Wall —a painting larger than the entire facade of the neighboring national parish church Our Lady of Vilnius. located on the multistory parking tower on the northwest corner of Varick and Broome directly in view of vehicles entering the Holland Tunnel. This mural (formerly the site of a megabillboard now gone because the whole building was demolished in November of 2015) at first appeared all white until, over time, it became ever more colorful as layers of water-soluble paint weathered away by rain revealed the artist's pigmented underlayers. The artist's intention was to use paints that were incompatible with each other, so that as the work weathered, different colors would emerge.[Parker, Kevin. \\"Wall Art, Bridge Art\\", Place Magazine, September 1981] The first layer was red epoxy paint; the second layer, yellow latex; the third layer was blue oil- based alkyd; the fourth layer was green-pigmented shellac, and the fifth (final) layer was whitewash of white water-soluble casein paint. (The geo- coordinates of the former site of the Holland Tunnel Wall mural are: 40.724455, -74.006305.) =Performance art= In an art prank which \\"Art in America\\" called \\"the conceptual artwork that ended conceptual art\\",Ripping off the Art Magazines, \\"Ripping Off the Art Magazines\\", Nancy Foote, Art in America, March, 1972 in 1970 Fugate-Wilcox and wife picked a nonexistent address on 57th Street (then the center of the New York art world) and created the fictitious Jean Freeman Gallery.Fine Art Publicity: The Complete Guide for Galleries and Artists, Susan Abbott, Allworth Communications, Inc., 2005, Google Books - citing How to Succeed (By Really Trying), Paul Gardner, ARTnews Like other significant galleries, the (secretly non-existent) Jean Freeman Gallery advertised in \\"Art in America\\"—but the advertising bills, mailed to the fake address, went unpaid.

In a televised appearance with Fugate-Wilcox on the \\"Today\\" show, \\"Art in America\\"'s Brian O'Doherty announced that the magazine would \\"donate\\" the costs of the unpaid advertising bills, and then discussed on-air the non- gallery as a conceptual artwork with Fugate-Wilcox and the show host.[Foote, Nancy. \\"Ripping Off the Art Magazines\\", Art in America, March, 1972, pg 49] In 1971, Terry Fugate-Wilcox donated a \\"surplus letter R\\" from his first name during a fundraiser for the Irish independence cause, thus going from Terry to Tery (still pronounced like \\"Terry\\"). Shortly afterward, \\"Art in America\\"'s Brian O'Doherty changed his name to \\"Patrick Ireland\\" in support of the same cause. Also in 1971, Tery and his wife, Valerie submitted nude passport photos.

Emulation involves newer systems simulating old gaming systems, while ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via ports or compilations. Additionally, the term could apply to a newer game, but with features similar to those of older games, such as a \\"retro RPG\\" which features turn-based combat and an isometric camera perspective.

Similarly, the games are known as retrogames, classic games, or old school games. GOING RETRO: 14 Old School Games You Can Play On Your iPhone Right Now Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the popularity of the Internet and emulation technology. It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras, the idea that older games are more innovative and original, and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay. Retrogaming and retrocomputing have been described as preservation activity and as aspects of the remix culture.  Games  The games and systems can be anything not in the current generation. Retro games can include video games as well as personal computer games for retrocomputing platforms. Arcade games are also popular, and were frequently attributed to individual programmers. The distinction between what is considered retro and modern is heavily debated, but it usually coincides with either the shift from 2D to 3D games (making the fourth gen the last retro generation, and the fifth being the first modern), the turn of the millennium and the increase in online gaming (making the fifth gen the last retro generation, and the sixth being the first modern), or the switch from RCA to HDMI cables for video and sound transfer (making the sixth gen the last retro generation, and the seventh being the first modern). Some games are played on the original hardware; others are played through emulation. Some retro games can still be played online using just the internet browser via DOS emulation. In some cases, entirely new versions of the games are designed, or remade. As well as playing games, a subculture of retrogaming has grown up around the music in retro games.  Retrogaming methods  In the wake of increasing nostalgia and the success of retro-compilations in the fifth, sixth, and seventh generations of consoles, retrogaming has become a motif in modern games, as well. Modern retrogames impose limitations on color palette, resolution, and memory well below the actual limits of the hardware in order to mimic the look of older hardware. These may be based on a general concept of retro, as with Cave Story, or an attempt to imitate a specific piece of hardware, as with La Mulana and its MSX color palette. This concept, known as Deliberate Retro and NosCon, began to gain traction thanks in part to the independent gaming scene, where the short development time was attractive and commercial viability was not a concern. Major publishers have embraced modern retrogaming with releases such as Mega Man 9, an attempt to mimic NES hardware; Retro Game Challenge, a compilation of new games on faux-NES hardware; and Sega's Fantasy Zone II remake, which uses emulated System 16 hardware running on PlayStation 2 to create a 16-bit reimagining of the 8-bit original. = Vintage retrogaming = Vintage retrogaming involves players collecting the original hardware, cartridges, and discs the video games were originally released on. The hardware collected includes arcade systems, old home consoles, and their cartridges and discs. Some of these collectables can be fairly expensive and hard to find, limiting the access to these old games.http://igcritic.com/what-happened-to-classic-video-game- packaging/http://www.racketboy.com/retro/nintendo/snes/the-rarest-and-most- valuable-super-nintendo-snes-games The vast majority, however, sell for much less than their retail price. The popularity of vintage retrogaming has led to the circulation of pirated copies of retro games, which are generally considered to lack the collector value of the original cartridges and discs. = Retrogaming emulation = Retrogaming emulation involves older gaming systems being emulated on new hardware. It bypasses the need to collect old consoles and original games. ROMs, read only memory files, are taken directly from the original cartridge or disc from third parties. They are then typically put online through file sharing sites and played via emulators on modern hardware. They are also often sold as re-releases, typically in compilations containing multiple games running on emulation software. Since emulation is a more accessible way to take part in retrogaming, it helped to popularize and expand on the hobby. = Ported retrogaming = Ported retrogaming involves old games being played on new systems, just as emulation. It differs from emulation because the games are rewritten for the new system and don't use the original ROM files. Ported games are available through official collections, console-based downloads, and plug and play systems. Ported retrogaming is comparatively rare, since emulation is a much easier and more accurate method of running retro games on modern hardware.  Remakes  Modern retrogaming may sometimes be more broadly applied to games that feature retro-style designs and reimaginings with more modern graphics. These enhanced remakes include Pac-Man: Championship Edition, Space Invaders Extreme, Super Mega Worm, 3D Dot Game Heroes. Some are based directly upon the enhanced emulation of original games, as with Nintendo's NES Remix. Screenshot of Paku Paku, a Pac-Man remake that targets the obscure and seldom used 160×100×16 mode of the CGA graphic card. When remakes are created by an individual or a group of enthusiasts without commercial motivation, such games sometimes are also called fangames. These are often motivated by the phenomenon of abandonware, which is the discontinuation of sales and support by the original producers. Examples of fan-made remakes are King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown, King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones, and Freeciv. The nostalgia-based revival of older game styles has also been accompanied by the development of the modern chiptune genre of game music. Chiptunes are characterized by severe limitations of sound imposed by the author's self- restriction to using only the original sound chips from 8-bit or 16-bit games. These compositions are featured in many retro-style modern games and are popular in the demoscene.  Re-releases  With the new possibility of the digital distribution in mid-2000 the commercial distribution of old classical game titles became feasible again as deployment and storage costs dropped significantly: A digital distributor specialized in bringing old games out of abandonware is GOG.com (formerly called Good Old Games) who started 2008 to search for copyright holders of classic games to re-release them legally and DRM-free. Notable online platforms for classic video game re- releases include Nintendo's Virtual Console and Sony's PlayStation Network. Mobile application developers have been purchasing the rights and licensing to re-release vintage arcade games on iOS and Android operating systems. Some publishers are creating spinoffs to their classic games, keeping the core gameplay while adding new features, levels, and styles of play.  Plug-and- play systems  Plug-and-play systems have been released or licensed by companies such as Atari, Sega, and Nintendo. These systems include stand-alone game libraries and plug directly into the user's television.  Retrogaming community  The Art of Video Games premiered at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012.The video game industry has an active audience, including the retrogaming sector. The retrogaming community has both online and physical spaces where retrogames are discussed, collected, and played. = Online retrogaming community = There are several websites and online forums devoted to both retrogaming and video games in general. The content on these online platforms typically includes reviews of older games, interviews with developers, fan-made content, game walkthroughs, and message boards for discussions. Many gameplay videos posted online feature attempts at breaking speedrun or high score records. = Fighting game community = The competitive Fighting game community traces its legacy from old-school arcades. Some fighting games have continued to receive arcade releases after the end of the arcade era. Face-to-face competition of Super Street Fighter II Turbo has been featured in the Evolution Championship Series. = Exhibitions = There are several events that retrogamers can take part in. Exhibits typically include vendors, retrogames available to play, tournaments, costumes, and live music, such as the Vancouver Retro Gaming Expo, run by Phase 3 events. This event has been occurring annually since March 17, 2012. = Retrogaming in museums = Retrogaming is recognized by museums worldwide. For example, the RetroGames arcade museum of Karlsruhe, Germany was founded in 2002RetroGames e.V. (german) and the Computerspielemuseum Berlin was founded in 1997. Some classical art museums bear a video gaming retrospective, as with 2012's Smithsonian American Art Museum exhibition titled The Art of Video Games or as part of the Museum of Modern Art \\"Applied Design\\" exhibition in 2013. Starting in 2015, The Strong National Museum of Play adds games annually to the World Video Game Hall of Fame. In 2016, the first museum dedicated solely to the history of the videogame industry, The National Videogame Museum, was opened in Frisco, Texas.  Legal issues surrounding retrogaming  Though many abandonware titles are available for free download on third-party websites, the duration of copyright on creative works in most countries is far longer than the era of home computing. Emulators are typically created by third parties, and the software they run is often taken directly from the original games and put online for free download. While it is completely legal for anyone to create an emulator for any hardware, unauthorized distribution of the code for a retro game is an infringement of the game's copyright. Some companies have made public statements regarding the issues, such as Nintendo, stating that \\"the introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date in the intellectual property rights of video game developers\\". However, video game developers and publishers typically turn a blind eye to emulation. One reason for this is that at any given time, most of the games illegally distributed for emulation are not presently being sold by the company which owns the game, and so the damages the company would collect in the event of a successful lawsuit would most likely be negligible.

A parfleche is a Native American rawhide container that is embellished by painting, incising, or both. Envelope-shaped parfleches have historically been used to contain items such household tools or foods, such as dried meat or pemmican. They were commonly made in pairs and hung from saddles. Their designs may have once served as maps.Goes In Center, Jhon (Oglala Lakota), \\" Native American and First Nations' GIS\\" for Native Geography 2000 In contemporary usage, they may carry social, spiritual, and symbolic meaning, or be part of dance or parade regalia. The bags are usually decorated with a distinctive style of graphic artwork, often symbolizing landscape features such as rivers and mountains. Historically women were the main creators of parfleches, first painting stretched-out raw hides, then shaping them into their final form. In the 21st century, both women and men make them. Overview The increased mobility among the post-contact Plains Indians horse culture required that essential goods such as preserved foods (including pemmican), clothing, medicines, and ceremonial items to be transported efficiently in lightweight and weatherproof packaging. While the most common form of the parfleche was the folded envelope or flat wallet, they were also constructed as laced flat cases, cylinders, and trunks. The production of parfleche bags declined drastically with mercenaries hired by the US federal government slaughtered to buffalo herds to the brink of extinction. The federal government forced Indigenous peoples to relocate onto government-partitioned reservations. While less visible to the colonists who were collecting them for museums, tribes, particularly the Nez Perce were able to continue hunting and making parfleches throughout the 20th century. The Niisitapi and Lakota people continue to produce parfleches today. Etymology The name \\"parfleche\\" was initially used by French fur traders in the region, and derives from the French language parer meaning \\"to parry\\" or \\"to defend\\", and flèche meaning \\"arrow\\". \\"Parfleche\\" was also used to describe tough rawhide shields, but later used primarily for these decorated rawhide containers. Different Indigenous peoples have their own names for these versatile packages, including ho'sēō'o (Cheyenne), bishkisché (Apsáalooke) and ho'úwoonó3 (Hinono'eino).  Construction  Historically parfleches were almost exclusively made by women. Creation began with “fleshing”, or the removal of the hide from animals such as elk, deer, and most commonly buffalo. Craftswomen employed bone tools fashioned as chisels for fleshing. The hide was stretched by staking it above the ground, and scraped to an even thickness. A glutinous wash (prepared of prickly pear cactus juice or animal glue) was applied for protection before the moist hide was painted. Until the 1890s, natural paints were overwhelmingly used, formed using substances such as charcoal for black, algae for green, and yellow ochre for red. Because artists had a limited amount of time to paint the parfleche design, they had to work with boldness and expertise as revisions were not possible. Once the paint was dry, the craftswomen de-haired the opposite side of the hide using a “stoning” method, and cut the outline of the parfleche using a flint or metal knife. Lastly, the container was folded into its chosen shape and holes were cut or burned to insert ties and laces. = Craftswomen's guilds = Historically, the Native women with the most talent in producing parfleches, the painted designs, and similar items, have held respected positions in their communities. These women historically formed local guilds, choosing elders to oversee the preservation, practice and teaching of these skills to their proteges. The guilds can also be credited with the consistency in parfleche design across multiple nations, as they preserve and pass down the customary designs, symbolism, meanings, and techniques. While parfleches have been stolen, collected, and admired as art pieces, their 19th-century creators (renowned in their own communities during their own times) have remained largely unknown to colonial anthropologists, collectors, and museum curators, and thus their names tend not to be known.

He is one of the earliest tirthankaras who are acknowledged as historical figures. He was the earliest exponent of Karma philosophy in recorded history. The Jain sources place him between the 9th and 8th centuries BC whereas historians point out that he lived in the 8th or 7th century BC. Parshvanatha was born 273 years before Mahavira. He was the spiritual successor of 22nd tirthankara Neminath. He is popularly seen as a propagator and reviver of Jainism. Parshvanatha attained moksha on Mount Sammeta (Madhuban, Jharkhand) in the Ganges basin, an important Jain pilgrimage site. His iconography is notable for the serpent hood over his head, and his worship often includes Dharanendra and Padmavati (Jainism's serpent god and goddess). According to Jain texts, Parshvanatha was born in Banaras (Varanasi), India. Renouncing worldly life, he founded an ascetic community. Texts of the two major Jain sects (Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras) differ on the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira, and this is a foundation of the dispute between the two sects. The Digambaras believe that there was no difference between the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira. According to the Śvētāmbaras, Mahavira expanded Parshvanatha's first four restraints with his ideas on ahimsa (non-violence) and added the fifth monastic vow (celibacy). Parshvanatha did not require celibacy, and allowed monks to wear simple outer garments. Śvētāmbara texts, such as section 2.15 of the Acharanga Sutra, say that Mahavira's parents were followers of Parshvanatha (linking Mahavira to a preexisting theology as a reformer of Jain mendicant tradition). Historicity Parshvanatha is the earliest Jain tirthankara who is generally acknowledged as a historical figure. According to Paul Dundas, Jain texts such as section 31 of Isibhasiyam provide circumstantial evidence that he lived in ancient India. Historians such as Hermann Jacobi have accepted him as a historical figure because his Chaturyama Dharma (Four Vows) are mentioned in Buddhist texts. Despite the accepted historicity, some historical claims (such as the link between him and Mahavira, whether Mahavira renounced in the ascetic tradition of Parshvanatha and other biographical details) have led to different scholarly conclusions. He is claimed in Jain texts to have been tall. Parshvanatha's biography is legendary, with Jain texts saying that he preceded Mahavira by 273 years and that he lived 100 years. Mahavira is dated to in the Jain tradition, and Parshvanatha is dated to . According to Dundas, historians outside the Jain tradition date Mahavira as contemporaneous with the Buddha in the 5th century BC and, based on the 273-year gap, date Parshvanatha to the 8th or 7th century BC. Doubts about Parshvanatha's historicity are supported by the oldest Jain texts, which present Mahavira with sporadic mentions of ancient ascetics and teachers without specific names (such as sections 1.4.1 and 1.6.3 of the Acaranga Sutra). The earliest layer of Jain literature on cosmology and universal history pivots around two jinas: the Adinatha (Rishabhanatha) and Mahavira. Stories of Parshvanatha and Neminatha appear in later Jain texts, with the Kalpa Sūtra the first known text. However, these texts present the tirthankaras with unusual, non-human physical dimensions; the characters lack individuality or depth, and the brief descriptions of three tirthankaras are largely modeled on Mahavira. Their bodies are celestial, like deva. The Kalpa Sūtra is the most ancient known Jain text with the 24 tirthankaras, but it lists 20; three, including Parshvanatha, have brief descriptions compared with Mahavira. Early archaeological finds, such as the statues and reliefs near Mathura, lack iconography such as lions or serpents (possibly because these symbols evolved later).  Jain biography  Parshvanatha was born in Varanasi, a historic city on the Ganges. Parshvanatha was the 23rd of 24 tirthankaras in Jain tradition. =Life before renunciation= He was born on the tenth day of the dark half of the Hindu month of Pausha to King Ashwasena and Queen Vamadevi of Varanasi . Parshvanatha belonged to the Ikshvaku dynasty. Before his birth, Jain texts state that he ruled as the god Indra in the 13th heaven of Jain cosmology. While Parshvanatha was in his mother's womb, gods performed the garbha-kalyana (enlivened the fetus). His mother dreamt sixteen auspicious dreams, an indicator in Jain tradition that a tirthankara was about to be born. According to the Jain texts, the thrones of the Indras shook when he was born and the Indras came down to earth to celebrate his janma-kalyanaka (his auspicious birth). Parshvanatha was born with blue-black skin. A strong, handsome boy, he played with the gods of water, hills and trees. At the age of eight, Parshvanatha began practicing the twelve basic duties of the adult Jain householder. He lived as a prince and soldier in Varanasi . According to the Digambara school, Parshvanatha never married; Śvētāmbara texts say that he married Prabhavati, the daughter of Prasenajit (king of Kusasthala). Heinrich Zimmer translated a Jain text that sixteen-year-old Parshvanatha refused to marry when his father told him to do so; he began meditating instead, because the \\"soul is its only friend\\". =Renunciation= At age 30, on the 11th day of the moon's waxing in the month of Pausha (December–January), Parshvanatha renounced the world to become a monk. He removed his clothes and hair, and began fasting strictly. Parshvanatha meditated for 84 days before he attained omniscience under a dhaataki tree near Benares. His meditation period included asceticism and strict vows. Parshvanatha's practices included careful movement, measured speech, guarded desires, mental restraint and physical activity, essential in Jain tradition to renounce the ego. According to the Jain texts, lions and fawns played around him during his asceticism. On the 14th day of the moon's waning cycle in the month of Chaitra (March–April), Parshvanatha attained omniscience. Heavenly beings built him a samavasarana (preaching hall), so he could share his knowledge with his followers. After preaching for 70 years, Parshvanatha attained moksha at Shikharji on Parasnath hill at the age of 78 on Savana Shukla Saptami according to Lunar Calendar. His death is considered moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death) in Jain tradition and celebrated as Moksha Saptami. This day is celebrated on large scale at Parasnath tonk of the mountain, in northern Jharkhand, part of the Parasnath Range by offering Nirvana Laddu (Sugar balls) and reciting of Nirvana Kanda. Parshvanatha has been called ' (beloved of the people) by Jains. =Previous lives= Parshvanatha and his yaksha, Dharanendra, in the 8th-century Tamil Nadu Kalugumalai Jain Beds Jain mythology contains legends about Parshvanatha's human and animal rebirths and the maturing of his soul towards inner harmony in a manner similar to legends found in other Indian religions. His rebirths include: * Marubhuti – Vishwabhuti, King Aravinda's prime minister, had two sons; the elder one was Kamath and the younger one was Marubhuti (Parshvanatha). Kamath committed adultery with Marubhuti's wife. The king learnt about the adultery, and asked Marubhuti how his brother should be punished; Marubhuti suggested forgiveness. Kamath went into a forest, became an ascetic and acquired demonic powers to take revenge. Marubhuti went to the forest to invite his brother back home, but Kamath killed Marubhuti by crushing him with a stone. Marubhuti was one of Parshvanatha's earlier rebirths. * Vajraghosha (Thunder), an elephant – He was then reborn as an elephant because of the \\"violence of the death and distressing thoughts he harbored at the time of his previous death\\". Vajraghosha lived in the forests of Vindyachal. Kamath was reborn as a serpent. King Aravinda, after the death of his minister's son, renounced his throne and led an ascetic life. When an angry Vajraghosha approached Aravinda, the ascetic saw that the elephant was the reborn Marubhuti. Aravinda asked the elephant to give up \\"sinful acts, remove his demerits from the past, realize that injuring other beings is the greatest sin, and begin practicing the vows\\". The elephant realized his error, became calm, and bowed at Aravinda's feet. When Vajraghosha went to a river one day to drink, the serpent Kamath bit him. He died peacefully this time, however, without distressing thoughts. * Sasiprabha – Vajraghosha was reborn as Sashiprabha (Lord of the Moon) in the twelfth heaven, surrounded by abundant pleasures. Sashiprabha, however, did not let the pleasures distract him and continued his ascetic life. * Agnivega – Sashiprabha died, and was reborn as Prince Agnivega (\\"strength of fire\\"). After he became king, he met a sage who told him about the impermanence of all things and the significance of a spiritual life. Agnivega realized the importance of religious pursuits, and his worldly life lost its charms. He renounced it to lead an ascetic life, joining the sage's monastic community. Agnivega meditated in the Himalayas, reducing his attachment to the outside world. He was bitten by a snake (the reborn Kamath), but the poison did not disturb his inner peace and he calmly accepted his death. Agnivega was reborn as a god with a life of \\"twenty-two oceans of years\\", and the serpent went to the sixth hell. The soul of Marubhuti-Vajraghosa-Sasiprabha-Agnivega was reborn as Parshvanatha. He saved serpents from torture and death during that life; the serpent god Dharanendra and the goddess Padmavati protected him, and are part of Parshvanatha's iconography. =Disciples= 8th-century stone relief of Parshvanatha at Thirakoil According to the Kalpa Sūtra (a Śvētāmbara text), Parshvanatha had 164,000 śrāvakas (male lay followers), 327,000 śrāvikās (female lay followers), 16,000 sādhus (monks) and 38,000 Sadhvis or aryikas (nuns). According to Śvētāmbara tradition, he had eight ganadharas (chief monks): Śubhadatta, Āryaghoṣa, Vasiṣṭha, Brahmacāri, Soma, Śrīdhara, Vīrabhadra and Yaśas. After his death, the Śvētāmbara believe that Śubhadatta became head of the monastic order and was succeeded by Haridatta, Āryasamudra and Keśī. According to Digambara tradition (including the Avasyaka niryukti), Parshvanatha had 10 ganadharas and Svayambhu was their leader. Śvētāmbara texts such as the Samavayanga and Kalpa Sūtras cite Pushpakula as the chief aryika of his female followers, but the Digambara Tiloyapannati text identifies her as Suloka or Sulocana. Parshvanatha's nirgrantha (without bonds) monastic tradition was influential in ancient India, with Mahavira's parents part of it as lay householders who supported the ascetics. Teachings Parshvanatha with Padmavati and Dharnendra in a 16th-century manuscript Texts of the two major Jain sects (Digambara and Śvētāmbara) have different views of Parshvanatha and Mahavira's teachings, which underlie disputes between the sects. Digambaras maintain that no difference exists between the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira. According to the Śvētāmbaras, Mahavira expanded the scope of Parshvanatha's first four restraints with his ideas on ahimsa (non-violence) and added the fifth monastic vow (celibacy) to the practice of asceticism. Parshvanatha did not require celibacy, and allowed monks to wear simple outer garments. Śvētāmbara texts such as section 2.15 of the Acharanga Sutra say that Mahavira's parents were followers of Parshvanatha, linking Mahavira to a preexisting theology as a reformer of Jain mendicant tradition. According to the Śvētāmbara tradition, Parshvanatha and the ascetic community he founded exercised a fourfold restraint; Mahavira stipulated five great vows for his ascetic initiation. This difference and its reason have often been discussed in Śvētāmbara texts. The Uttardhyayana Sutra (a Śvētāmbara text) describes Keśin Dālbhya as a follower of Parshvanatha and Gautama Buddha as a disciple of Mahavira and discusses which doctrine is true: the fourfold restraint or the five great vows. Gautama says that there are outward differences, and these differences are \\"because the moral and intellectual capabilities of the followers of the ford-makers have differed\\". According to Wendy Doniger, Parshvanatha allowed monks to wear clothes; Mahavira recommended nude asceticism, a practice which has been a significant difference between the Digambara and Śvētāmbara traditions. According to the Śvētāmbara texts, Parshvanatha's four restraints were ahimsa, aparigraha (non-possession), asteya (non-stealing) and satya (non-lying). Ancient Buddhist texts (such as the Samaññaphala Sutta) which mention Jain ideas and Mahavira cite the four restraints, rather than the five vows of later Jain texts. This has led scholars such as Hermann Jacobi to say that when Mahavira and the Buddha met, the Buddhists knew only about the four restraints of the Parshvanatha tradition. Further scholarship suggests a more- complex situation, because some of the earliest Jain literature (such as section 1.8.1 of the Acharanga Sutra) connects Mahavira with three restraints: non-violence, non-lying and non-possession. The \\"less than five vows\\" view of Śvētāmbara texts is not accepted by the Digambaras, a tradition whose canonical texts have been lost and who do not accept Śvētāmbara texts as canonical. Digambaras have a sizable literature, however, which explains their disagreement with Śvētāmbara interpretations. Prafulla Modi rejects the theory of differences between Parshvanatha's and Mahavira's teachings. Champat Rai Jain writes that Śvētāmbara texts insist on celibacy for their monks (the fifth vow in Mahavira's teachings), and there must not have been a difference between the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira. Padmanabh Jaini writes that the Digambaras interpret \\"fourfold\\" as referring \\"not to four specific vows\\", but to \\"four modalities\\" (which were adapted by Mahavira into five vows). Western and some Indian scholarship \\"has been essentially Śvētāmbara scholarship\\", and has largely ignored Digambara literature related to the controversy about Parshvanatha's and Mahavira's teachings. Paul Dundas writes that medieval Jain literature, such as that by the 9th-century Silanka, suggests that the practices of \\"not using another's property without their explicit permission\\" and celibacy were interpreted as part of non-possession. In literature Parshvanatha iconography is identified by a sesha hood above his head and a cobra stamped (or carved) beneath his feet. At the center of his chest is a shrivatsa, which identifies Jain statues. * Uvasagharam Stotra is an ode to Parshvanatha which was written by Bhadrabahu. * Jinasena's Mahapurāṇa includes \\"Ādi purāṇa\\" and Uttarapurana. It was completed by Jinasena's 8th-century disciple, Gunabhadra. \\"Ādi purāṇa\\" describes the lives of Rishabhanatha, Bahubali and Bharata. The Kalpa Sūtra contains biographies of the tirthankaras Parshvanatha and Mahavira. * Guru Gobind Singh wrote a biography of Parshvanatha in the 17th-century Paranath Avtar, part of the Dasam Granth. * Sankhesvara Stotram is hymn to Parshvanatha compiled by Mahopadhyaya Yashovijya. Iconography Parshvanatha is a popular tirthankara who is worshiped (bhakti) with Rishabhanatha, Shantinatha, Neminatha and Mahavira. He is believed to have the power to remove obstacles and save devotees. Parshvanatha is usually depicted in a lotus or kayotsarga posture. Statues and paintings show his head shielded by a multi-headed serpent, fanned out like an umbrella. Parshvanatha's snake emblem is carved (or stamped) beneath his legs as an icon identifier. His iconography is usually accompanied by Dharnendra and Padmavati, Jainism's snake god and goddess. Serpent-hood iconography is not unique to Parshvanatha; it is also found above the icons of Suparshvanatha, the seventh of the 24 tirthankaras, but with a small difference. Suparshvanatha's serpent hood has five heads, and a seven (or more)-headed serpent is found in Parshvanatha icons. Statues of both tirthankaras with serpent hoods have been found in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, dating to the 5th to 10th centuries. Archeological sites and medieval Parshvantha iconography found in temples and caves include scenes and yaksha. Digambara and Śvētāmbara iconography differs; Śvētāmbara art shows Parshvanatha with a serpent hood and a Ganesha-like yaksha, and Digambara art depicts him with serpent hood and Dhranendra. According to Umakant Premanand Shah, Hindu gods (such as Ganesha) as yaksha and Indra as serving Parshvanatha, assigned them to a subordinate position.

It is the district headquarters of Pratapgarh district the newest district of Rajasthan. Famous for its Thewa art, the city is surrounded by tribal villages. It is famous for its edible jiralun and hing.  History  Maharana Kumbha ruled Chittorgarh in the 14th century. Due to a dispute with his younger brother Kshemkarn he expelled him from his territory. Kshemkarn's family was a refugee for some time and lived in the Aravali ranges in near south of Rajasthan. In 1514, his son Rajkumar Surajmal became the ruler of Devgarh, and this Raj later came to be known as Pratapgarh Raj. As the environment of Devgarh was not found to be suitable by the royal family, one of the descendants of Raja Surajmal, Rajkumar Pratapsingh started to build a new town near Devgarh in 1698 and named it Pratapgarh.http://116.50.64.10/pjym/AP_history.htm  Geography  Pratapgarh District is a newly constituted district in Rajasthan state. it came into existence on 26 January 2008 as the 33rd district of Rajasthan. Pratapgarh is located at 24.03° N 74.78° E. It has an average elevation of 491 metres (1610 feet). It is said to be the second highest place in Rajasthan after Mount Abu =Topography= The internal part of the city has many narrow streets and some of them are so narrow that it is hard for two bikes to cross each other. In the last decade, the outer parts of the city are developing rapidly. The topography of the area is undulating because of the confluence of three different geological formations- Malwa Plateau, Vindhyachal Hills and Aravali ranges. Nearby cities include Chhoti Sadri 47 km, and Mandsaur 32 km. Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Pratapgarh had a total population of 42,079, of which 21,499 were males and 20,580 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 5,154. The total number of literates in Pratapgarh was 31,687, which constituted 75.3% of the population with male literacy of 80.5% and female literacy of 69.9%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Pratapgarh was 85.8%, of which male literacy rate was 92.2% and female literacy rate was 79.2%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 5,344 and 3,459 respectively. Pratapgarh had 8749 households in 2011.  Culture  The city is a blend of old and new cultures. In nearby villages, the tribal culture still thrives. Every Sunday when the tribes come to the city to buy merchandise in the weekly haat market, the city also looks tribal. After the declaration as a district, new development plans has been executed in the city by state government.  Services and infrastructure  There are three cinema halls. They are Archana, Pratap and Samata. The Pratap theatre was the first cinema hall in the whole Udaipur zone when it was built in 1945. The former Darpan cinema has now been shut off to run some other business. Communication services are being run by Airtel, BSNL(evdo), Idea, Reliance, Tata Indicom, and Vodafone. Due to its strategic location the Airport Authority of India has installed here a VOR station for guiding aircraft their path. It is said that Pratapgarh is midway between Delhi-Mumbai route. Though Pratapgarh is connected to all important towns by road, a railway line is unlikely, since due to the height at which it is located, it would be very costly to build a railway line.  Education  The standard of education in Pratapgarh has risen radically since the late 1980s. The first English-language middle school was opened in 1989. Since then many education institutes have opened up. Educational services are available now for primary (up to 5th class), middle (up to 8th class), secondary (up to 10th class), higher secondary (up to 12th class) and graduation (Bachelor's degree). The city also have a cram school for pre medical and engineering courses.  Ecotourism  Pratapgarh is a popular venue for ecotourism. The Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary encompasses attractive fauna and flora, including flying squirrels, black-naped monarchs, and lesser floricans.

It is traditionally calculated by collecting 100 utterances spoken by a child and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of utterances. A higher MLU is taken to indicate a higher level of language proficiency. Mean length of utterance is a good marker of language impairment. It is the number of words or morphemes in each of their spontaneous utterances. It can be used to benchmark language acquisition and is used to compare language intervention outcomes in children with autism. In testing of children ages 3-9 with diagnoses of autism or autism spectrum disorders and nonverbal IQ scores below 85, results indicated that children with autism persistently scored below the unaffected group without significant improvement in scores concerning mean length of utterance. There may be variability in outcomes due to sampling differences. A study by Bishop and Adams (1990) suggests that MLU at 4.5 is a good predictor of reading ability at age 8. Nonetheless MLU is considered controversial, and should not be used as the only diagnostic measure of language proficiency in children.

In modern times, most sound tests function mostly as a jukebox to listen to the game's music, sound effects, and voice tracks for enjoyment outside of the game itself. They are sometimes used as a place to enter cheat codes. Sound test and cheat codes Some games feature cheat codes related to the sound test. Usually, songs need to be played in a particular order. For instance, in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, it is possible to select levels in this manner. In some games, a cheat code might be necessary to reach the sound test screen (such as in Sonic the Hedgehog 3), or some other specific method is needed to unlock it, such as \\"buying\\" it with earned credit for achievements in-game. In other games, the sound test is unrelated to cheat codes and is often among the last items to be unlocked.

These are usually activated in manufacture and also people discover them in their own time and share them on video sharing sites like YouTube. Games such as Bop It, Brain Warp and the Loopz Shifter have a hidden program on which when entered, the toy starts saying random numbers like \\"1.36\\" and then the toy is expecting you to press one of its buttons to advance to the next stage of the test mode. There are also additional sound test modes which allows you to press a button that will make different sound effects. This website details how to access every test mode on all the Bop It games.

Acquired under the guise of the Breton cause, it became a vehicle for collaborationist ideas. Roparz Hemon ran the station as Director of Programming. Hemon focused on cultural and intellectual themes, rather than explicitly political issues. Contributors were typically associated with the pre-war journal Gwalarn, which had been set up to promote a literary high culture in Breton. Unlike Radio Paris, Radio Rennes Bretagne never broadcast outright Nazi propaganda. However, racist ideas were subtly inserted into programmes which had high cultural content.

It is the seat of the Papineau Regional County Municipality. In 2001 its population was 2247. The municipality is bordered on the north side by the Petite-Nation River and on the south side by Pentecost Bay of the Ottawa River. History The Parish of Sainte-Angélique was formed in 1851, and the parish municipality with the same name was created in 1855. It was named after Angélique-Louise Cornud, wife of Denis-Benjamin Papineau, who donated land for the construction of the church and the rectory. Also in 1855, a post office was established with the name Papineauville. This may be named in honour of one of two persons named Papineau: Joseph Papineau (1752–1841), father of Louis-Joseph Papineau, who in 1801 bought the lordship of the Petite-Nation where the town formed; or Denis-Benjamin Papineau (1789–1854), brother of Louis-Joseph and husband of Angélique-Louise, and considered the founder of this place. In 1896, the Village Municipality of Papineauville separated from Sainte-Angélique. Its first mayor was Henri Bourassa. On November 29, 2000, the Village Municipality of Papineauville and the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Angélique were reunited and merged into the new Municipality of Papineauville. The name Sainte-Angélique now identifies the sector of Papineauville which corresponds to the territory of the former parish municipality.

This format contrasts with the large choirbook, which included all of the voice parts and could be shared by an entire choir. The choirbook still followed the convention to notate the parts separately, but within a double page, likewise part books were arranged that they show the one extract of the composition on the same page. The production of partbooks appears to have been a cost-cutting measure, as large-scale printing was much more expensive. For example, by 1529, King's College, Cambridge had replaced almost all of its choirbooks with partbooks. The reduced cost also allowed each performer to have his own copy, and partbooks were more portable than a choirbook. They were, however, flimsy, and originals do not survive in large numbers. Choral scores completely replaced individual vocal parts during the 19th century. While instruments continue to use parts for ease of page turning, these are rarely bound into \\"books\\" and are no longer so called.

Its name stands for \\"Pentagon/Twin Towers Bombing Investigation\\". The investigation was launched on September 11, 2001, and involved 4,000 special agents and 3,000 professional employees. Identifying the hijackers The FBI was able to identify the 19 hijackers within a matter of days as few suspects made any effort to conceal their names on flight, credit card, and other records. =Identical letters= Three of the hijackers carried copies of an identical handwritten letter (in Arabic) that was found in three separate locations: the first, in a suitcase of hijacker Mohamed Atta that did not make the connection to American Airlines Flight 11 that crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center; the second, in a vehicle parked at Washington Dulles International Airport that belonged to hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi; and the third at the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. According to the testimony before the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Defense on October 3, 2001 given by J. T. Caruso—the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, \\"translations of the letter indicate an alarming willingness to die on the part of the hijackers.\\" =Passports recovered= According to testimony by Susan Ginsberg, a staff member of the National Commission on Terrorist attacks upon the United States, in the January 26, 2004, Public Hearing: :Four of the hijackers' passports have survived in whole or in part. Two were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These are the passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi. One belonged to a hijacker on American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Satam al Suqami. A passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the World Trade Center towers collapsed. A fourth passport was recovered from luggage that did not make it from a Portland flight to Boston on to the connecting flight which was American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Abdul Aziz al Omari. :In addition to these four, some digital copies of the hijackers passports were recovered in post-9/11 operations. Two of the passports that have survived, those of Satam al Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari, were clearly doctored. These passports were manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al Qaeda. WTC site The passport of hijacker Satam al-Suqami was found a few blocks from the World Trade Center. Flight 93 According to the 9/11 Commission, the passports of two of the Flight 93 hijackers were also found intact in the aircraft's debris field. Atta's luggage The doctored passport of hijacker Abdulaziz Alomari was found in Mohamed Atta's left-behind luggage. When examining Mohamed Atta's left-behind luggage, the FBI found important clues about the hijackers and their plans. His luggage contained papers that revealed the identity of all 19 hijackers, and provided information about their plans, motives, and backgrounds. The FBI was able to determine details such as dates of birth, known and/or possible residences, visa statuses, and specific identities of the suspected pilots. None of these documents have been scrutinized by independent legal experts. Linking the hijackers to al Qaeda The investigators were quickly able to link the 19 men to the terrorist organization al Qaeda, by accessing their intelligence agency files. The New York Times reported on September 12 that: \\"Authorities said they had also identified accomplices in several cities who had helped plan and execute Tuesday's attacks. Officials said they knew who these people were and important biographical details about many of them. They prepared biographies of each identified member of the hijack teams, and began tracing the recent movements of the men.\\" FBI agents in Florida investigating the hijackers quickly \\"descended on flight schools, neighborhoods and restaurants in pursuit of leads.\\" At one flight school, \\"students said investigators were there within hours of Tuesday's attacks.\\" The Washington Post later reported that \\"In the hours after Tuesday's bombings, investigators searched their files on [Satam] Al Suqami and [Ahmed] Alghamdi, noted the pair's ties to [Nabil] al- Marabh and launched a hunt for him.\\" On September 27, 2001, the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers, along with information about the possible nationalities and aliases of many. On the day of the attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies also intercepted communications that pointed to Osama bin Laden. It was quickly asserted that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the attacks, and other suspects were ruled out. Although he denied the attacks at first, Osama bin Laden later admitted full and sole responsibility for the attacks in a video tape.

It is located on the Ottawa River, and is within Canada's National Capital Region. Its population was 2,818 as of the 2016 Canadian Census. History In 1807, a group of Scots settled in the southern part of the Blanche River valley, in the township known at the time as Lochaber Gore. They came from Thurso in Scotland, as well as from the Highlands, near Lochaber and other parts of northern Scotland. In 1830, Irish immigrants arrived, followed by French Canadians around 1840. In 1822, a Baptist Church was established, and in 1853, the post office opened, causing a controversy. The Catholic community suggested to name it Fraserville, while the Scottish community favored Cameron, because most were from this clan. The Post Master settled on the name Thurso, since there already was a place called Fraserville in Canada. In 1886, the town was incorporated as a village municipality, which was followed by the establishment of the religious and civil parish the next year. Starting in 1850, Thurso became an important centre of the wood industry. In 1929, the Singer Manufacturing Co. opened a sewing machine plant there. Around the same time construction began on a long railroad for the transportation of lumber from the interior (which closed in 1986). In 1956, the paper mill opened. In 1963, Thurso changed its statutes and became a ville (town/city). =Earthquakes = An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.5 was centered north in Thurso at 8:39 pm, on February 24, 2006. Another earthquake with a magnitude of 4.1 was centered in Thurso at 3;39pm on September 18, 2006.  Demographics  Mother tongue: * English as first language: 2.7% * French as first language: 95.0% * English and French as first language: 1.4% * Other as first language: 0.7%  Economy  Thurso was known for the unpleasant odour emanating from its paper mill, which originates from the burning of chemical residue when the pulp is manufactured and the smell was there well before the retaining basin was built. Fortress Paper employs 335 people in Thurso to produce 250,000 tonnes hardwood kraft market pulp. However, the company had financial difficulties and led to its operations temporarily being shut down in 2006 and again for an eight-week period in 2009. The Lauzon sawmill was another major employer for the community, but its building was destroyed by a fire on March 8, 2007, putting 100 workers temporarily out of work. However, plans for relaunching the production activity started shortly after the event. Thurso's only bar/hotel, Hotel Lafontaine, burned twice in 2009; once in February and again a month later, with the latter fire resulting in complete destruction. In 2010, Hotel Lafontaine reopened just beside its previous location.  Transportation  Thurso's main access roads are currently Route 148 (running west–east) and Route 317 (running south–north). Autoroute 50, approximately 3 km north of Thurso along Route 317 complements Route 148 as Thurso's second connection to Gatineau and Ottawa. Voyageur Colonial Bus Lines provides service to Ottawa and to Montreal. The Quebec Gatineau Railway provides rail freight transport. A seasonal ferry operates between Thurso and Clarence, Ontario.

Its official name was the \\"broadcloth helmet\\" (шлем суконный). Named after Red Army cavalry commander Semyon Budyonny, it was also known as the \\"frunzenka\\" after the Commissar Mikhail Frunze. It is a soft, woolen hat that covers the ears and neck. The cap features a peak and folded earflaps that can be buttoned under the chin. It has been a very important part of the Russian revolution. History The hat was created as part of a new uniform for the Russian army by Viktor Vasnetsov, a famous Russian painter, who was inspired by the Kiev Rus helmet. The original name was bogatyrka (богатырка) – the hat of a bogatyr – and was intended to inspire Russian troops by connecting them with the legendary heroes of Russian folklore. Bogatyrkas were meant to be a part of a new uniform, so they had already been produced during World War I, but hadn't been officially adopted. Another version, quite popular in Russia, is that bogatyrkas were designed for a military parade as a part of a \\"historical\\" stylized uniform (which also included an overcoat with \\"designer\\" cross- pieces, which evoked those worn by the Streltsy in the 16th to 18th centuries, which also were used in the Red Army to a limited extent). Some Russian historians even speculate the parade in question was a supposed victory parade in Berlin. Some view the bogatyrkas as an evolution of the bashlyk conical hoods worn by the Russian military since the mid-19th century. During the Russian civil war, communist troops, who had no obligation to comply with the uniform standards of the Imperial Russian army, used bogatyrkas, as they were abundant and distinctive. Bogatyrkas were commonly decorated with red star pins as a distinguishing mark. Such decorations were often makeshift, but later were standardized, and a bigger star badge of broadcloth was sewn to the front of the hat, typically red but in some cases blue (for cavalry) or black (for artillery). This allowed the communists to use the image of \\"Red bogatyrs fighting the old Russian system, employing the original idea by Vasnetsov. At this time the hat was renamed the Budenovka after Semyon Budyonny, the commander of the First Cavalry Army, as the hat (with the blue star) was particularly popular with cavalry units. It was also called the Frunzenka after Mikhail Frunze, one of Bolshevik army leaders. As authorised in January 1919, the budenovka was intended as a winter headdress. Made of khaki cloth, the hat included flaps capable of being pulled down and fastened under the chin. The distinctive spike was created by a stiffened coil sewn into the crown and covered by khaki cloth. The initial model with the high tip was replaced with a more practical low-tip model in 1927. A summer version briefly existed, made from lighter cloth and lacking flaps. The hat was not part of the Red Army uniform for long, for both political and practical reasons. Although it was relatively easy to produce, it required expensive wool, did not provide good cold-weather protection and could not be worn under a helmet. Another reason was that it belonged to the revolutionary period of Russian history in which artistic and political expression had been under less rigorous control by the state. It was abandoned during the army reforms of the mid-1930s, and phasing-out started in 1935. Budenovkas were still in use during the Winter War of 1939, and the disastrous failure of Soviet equipment and gear led to the introduction of various improved winter uniforms. The Soviet army was to receive the garrison cap (called \\"pilotka\\") and the outdoor ushanka, the latter being based on the Finnish turkislakki army fur caps. In the Red Army, Budenovka were mostly replaced by the start of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, but some of them were still used by Soviet partisans. The budenovka became part of history as Red Army cavalry men wearing budennovkas became an iconic cultural image from the Russian civil war, together with tachankas, the Nagant revolver or Mauser C96, Maxim gun and rebelling sailors with ammo belts slung over their chests. Stylized budyonovkas were popular children's headgear until late Soviet times.

Terminology A parure typically consists of a combination of a matching necklace, earrings, brooch, bracelet and often a diadem or tiara. A variation is the demiparure which consists of as few as two matching pieces, such as earrings and a necklace or brooch. Design Cleverly, the parure was not static but modular and could be remade into more fashionable jewelry in order to stay au courant in the court and fashion-forward for the times. Members of court and higher social ranks vied for the best jewelers to create the most imaginative and elaborate collections that would astound one another and increase their status. Some necklaces could be worn intact or temporarily disassembled into bracelets, pendants, hair ornaments or brooches with smart interchangeable components and locking systems. Cases for storing Parure were also often highly decorative. History The artisans under Louis XIV were credited with some of the first parure inventions in the 18th century. Diamonds, often paired with silver, were popular at that time. The standout example was created for Mademoiselle d’Aubigné’s wedding, which included: earrings, two pendants, loops and clasps for the sleeves, 32 buttons, and a large bowknot. There is a bias to towards paste parures from the period surviving to the present. The low value of the component parts making them less likely to be broken up for reuse. Napoleon was fond of lavishing these gem suites on his beloved first wife, Joséphine, to wear at state functions. Later, he gave similar sets to his second wife, Marie-Louise, including a set made from cut steel. From the mid 19th century, parures made up of hair jewellery or jet pieces were made for mourning wear.

The world premiere performance was held at The Royal Albert Hall on 14 October 1997. History Following up on 1991's Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio, the Standing Stone project was composed out of a long poem McCartney authored to describe the way Celtic man might have wondered about the origins of life and the mystery of existence. McCartney composed the work as a commission from Richard Lyttleton, the then president of EMI Classics, to celebrate EMI's centenary celebrations. Unlike Liverpool Oratorio, the project was not an operatic performance of a story, but an instrumental one, though employing the use of a choir. For the first time in his career, McCartney used a personal computer and software to help compose. The work was recorded by the 80 piece London Symphony Orchestra, a 120-member choir, and conducted by Lawrence Foster at EMI's Abbey Road Studios. Standing Stone was engineered by John Kurlander and mixed and edited at Hog Hill Mill Studios, McCartney's private studio in Sussex, England. It was released on compact disc which included a 48-page booklet. The booklet reprinted in full McCartney's original poem that inspired the project, an essay by Andrew Stewart, and reproductions of two paintings by Paul from 1994 named Standing Stone Story and Standing Stone Story II. A two LP vinyl edition, limited to 2,500 copies, was also released. The cover is one of the many photos taken by Linda McCartney during late 1969/early 1970 that would initially be seen on the inside gatefold cover of Paul's first album McCartney. This project was her husband's last release before Linda died of breast cancer on 17 April 1998, having been diagnosed almost three years earlier. A documentary was made during the sessions, The Making of Standing Stone, and subsequently broadcast on BBC and PBS. The world premiere performance at The Royal Albert Hall was also filmed and broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. The concert and documentary were later released together on DVD. Release Released on 25 September 1997 in the US, and 29 September in the UK, Paul McCartney's Standing Stone topped the classical music charts, and managed a one-week stand at number 194 on the US pop album listings.

Founded in 1947, the Lakers are one of the NBA's most famous and successful franchises. As of summer 2012, the Lakers hold the all-time records for wins (3,125), winning percentage (.620), and NBA Finals appearances (32). They are tied in NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, winning 17 NBA titles and making far more finals appearances than their biggest rival (15 vs 4 in being runner up), effectively making them the most successful to date. Their team have included some of the game's greatest players, including George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Clyde Lovellette, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Gail Goodrich, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James.LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History 1947–1958: Beginnings and Minneapolis dynasty Hall of Famer George Mikan (#99) led the Lakers franchise to their first five NBA championships. He is described by the NBA's official website as the \\"first superstar\\" in league history. The Lakers franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems franchise of the National Basketball League (NBL) for $15,000 from Gems founder/owner C. King Boring,http://www.getdetroitsports.com/didyouknow.php?NewsID=2516http://www.lakersweb.com/history.htmlhttp://www.ixgames.com/los_angeles_lakers/ and business partner Maury Winston. They hired John Kundla as their first head coach. Berger and Chalfen relocated the team to Minneapolis, with home games being played at both the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory. The \\"team\\" that Berger and Chalfen had actually purchased consisted only of equipment; since the team had appeared to be on the verge of folding, all of its players had already been assigned to other NBL teams. The franchise was re-christened the \\"Lakers\\" in reference to Minnesota's nickname, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Berger and Chalfen brought in Max Winter, later to become a founder and owner of the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings, to become the Lakers' new general manager. Winter also took an ownership stake in the team, which he would maintain until he left the Lakers in 1955. As the Gems had recorded by far the worst record in the NBL, the Lakers had the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan, later to become one of the greatest centers of his time. With Mikan, new coach John Kundla and an infusion of former University of Minnesota players to replace those lost prior to the relocation, the Lakers won the NBL championship in their first season. The 1949–50 NBA champion Minneapolis Lakers The next year, the Lakers switched to the 12-team Basketball Association of America (BAA) and proceeded to win the championship in that season. As the BAA is considered the direct lineal ancestor of today's NBA, this 1949 BAA championship is recognized today as an official NBA championship for the Lakers, whereas their 1948 NBL championship is not. This makes the Lakers the most successful expansion team in NBA history, since the NBA does not recognize NBL records and considers the Lakers to be a 1948 expansion team. The next year saw the absorbing of the defunct NBL by the BAA, to form today's NBA, and the Lakers won the championship on the backs of Mikan, Vern Mikkelsen, and future National Football League coach Bud Grant. The Lakers' two-year streak of championships came to an end in 1951, when they lost to the Rochester Royals in the NBA Western Division Finals. Nevertheless, they rebounded from that defeat to capture the title for the next three consecutive years, thus becoming the NBA's first \\"dynasty\\", having won five BAA/NBA championships in six years. In addition to Mikan and Mikkelsen, the Lakers teams of these years also featured future Hall of Famers in Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, and Clyde Lovellette. During this time, the team also participated in the lowest-scoring game in NBA history; on November 22, 1950, the Lakers fell to the Fort Wayne Pistons by a score of 19–18. This contest later proved to be a factor in the league's introduction of the shot clock. Injuries forced Mikan to retire after the 1954 season, and the Lakers missed him dearly. Not only that, but the NBA introduced rule changes (the 24-second shot clock and a limit of six personal fouls per team per quarter) which forced them to play an entirely new style of basketball to which they were unaccustomed. Lovellette led the team in scoring, but the Lakers fared so poorly in the 1955 season that Mikan was persuaded to come out of retirement for the 1956 season. His play was not up to his former standards, however, and halfway through the season, he retired again, this time for good. The 1956 Lakers would go on to make the playoffs, only to lose to the St. Louis Hawks. After Mikan's retirement, attendance at Lakers games dropped off sharply. In 1957, the team was nearly sold to Kansas City interests who planned to relocate it there, before a local group helmed by businessman Bob Short purchased the team and kept it in Minneapolis. The new ownership was unable to cure the team's financial ills, however. The Lakers found their way back the playoffs in 1957, when they lost to the Hawks once more. The following year was disastrous, however, as Mikan became head coach before finding he was not suited to the task. After compiling a 9–30 record, he stepped aside in favor of Kundla, but the Lakers found themselves last in the league that year with a 19–53 record. 1958–1968: The Baylor/West duo – Move to Los Angeles and Celtics rivalry uprightthumbJerry West (#44) led the team to nine NBA Finals appearances in the 1960s and 1970s. Nicknamed \\"Mr. Clutch\\", his silhouette is featured on the NBA's official logo. * Last place, however, meant the first pick in the draft, and the Lakers chose wisely, picking Elgin Baylor, who went on to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 24.9 points per game and 15.0 rebounds per game. In 1959, Baylor and Mikkelsen were able to lead the team past their recent nemesis, the Hawks, and into the Finals, where they fell to the then-emerging Boston Celtics in the first four- game sweep in NBA Finals history. This marked the start of the long rivalry between the two teams. 1960 saw the Lakers start poorly, but they managed to make the playoffs with a meager 25–50 record. They were defeated again, however, by the Hawks. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball moved to Los Angeles and quickly became a huge financial success. Short did not fail to notice this. After considering moves to Chicago and San Francisco, he decided to move the franchise to Los Angeles prior to the 1961 season, making the Lakers the NBA's first West Coast team. The Lakers did not change their name after this second move, despite the general scarcity of natural lakes in southern California. Minneapolis, meanwhile, would remain without an NBA franchise until the debut of the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1989. Besides the relocation to Los Angeles, a second big change to the team was the addition of point guard Jerry West. A third was the hiring of West's college coach Fred Schaus to helm the team, and a fourth was the post-season addition of Francis Dayle \\"Chick\\" Hearn as the Lakers' play-by-play announcer. Hearn would go on to hold that post for the next 41 years. The new Los Angeles Lakers, behind Baylor's 34.8 points per game and 19.8 rebounds per game, improved on the previous year's results before losing once more to the Hawks in the Western Conference Finals. The duo of Baylor and West proved to be lethal and they both finished among the NBA's top 10 scorers for the next four years. Baylor was called to active military duty during the 1961–62 season following the Berlin crisis and was only available on weekends. Nevertheless, Baylor and West went on to average 38.3 and 30.8 points per game respectively during the regular season. The Lakers were able to pull together and make the NBA Finals, only to lose in heartbreaking fashion to a now-dominant Celtics team. Baylor set a record for most points scored in a playoff game with 61, which stood for 25 years and is still an NBA Finals and regulation game record. The Celtics defeated the Lakers twice more in the Finals over the next three years. September 1965 saw another team upheaval when Short sold the team to Canadian-American entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke for $5 million. Also, rookie Gail Goodrich joined the team. Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich was a Laker for nine seasons in the 1960s and 1970s, and played in four NBA Finals. On November 20 of that year, the Lakers played the San Francisco Warriors in Las Vegas. The game was notable because Chick Hearn was not present to announce it. He had gone to Fayetteville, Arkansas to announce a college football game, and inclement weather had prevented his flight from being able to leave in time for him to make it to Las Vegas for the Lakers game. It was only the second game he had missed for the Lakers since starting with the team in 1961. It was also the last game he would miss for the next 36 years. Beginning on November 21, 1965, Hearn announced the next 3,338 consecutive Laker regular season and playoff games. As for the team that season, the Lakers would find themselves in the Finals once again in 1966, promptly losing to the Celtics once again. The Lakers moved to Cooke's brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967 with new coach Bill van Breda Kolff. That year saw the team repeat its now- bitter pattern, losing to the Celtics in the 1968 NBA Finals. 1968–1975: The Baylor/West/Chamberlain trio 1971–72 team that is considered one of the best in NBA history. It had become clear that the Lakers needed to counter the great Celtics center, Bill Russell, and thus Cooke obtained Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers, hoping to supplement the aging and ailing Baylor. The move seemed at first to have worked, as the 1969 Lakers proceeded to compile a better record than the Celtics behind Chamberlain's league leading 21.1 rebounds per game. The two clubs met once again in the NBA Finals, but for the first time the Lakers had the advantage as they were clearly considered the better team entering the series by most observers. However, they once again failed to top their rivals and the Celtics emerged from the series as victorious yet again, winning their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. That 1969 championship series is also notable in that Jerry West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award. 1970 saw Jerry West win the NBA scoring title at 31.2 points per game, and the Lakers returned to the Finals where, for the first time since moving to Los Angeles, they did not have to face the Celtics. This time it was the New York Knicks, a team which included future Lakers coach Phil Jackson. West made a memorable 60-foot shot as the fourth- quarter buzzer sounded in Game 3, forcing that game into overtime and helping West earn the nickname \\"Mr. Clutch\\". However, the Knicks recovered from what might have seemed a crushing blow and took the game in overtime. In Game 5, Knicks center Willis Reed tore a muscle in his leg and it looked as if he would not play again in the series. However, the Knicks found a way to win Game 5 without him. Afterward, the Lakers took Game 6 to force a seventh and final game back in New York. With everyone speculating as to his status for the game, Reed created one of the most memorable moments in NBA history as he came out of the Madison Square Garden tunnel and onto the court to start Game 7. To the roar of the crowd, Reed scored the first two baskets and the Knicks were off and running. Reed left the game for good at halftime, but the inspired Knicks already had 24-point lead at that point, and went on to rout the Lakers. It was Los Angeles' seventh NBA Finals failure in the last nine years. The next year would not be the Lakers' year either. Baylor played in only two games due to injuries, and the Milwaukee Bucks, led by Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), defeated Los Angeles in the Western Conference Finals. That year, however, did see the Laker debut of their future coach, Pat Riley. No one could have foreseen the team's domination the next season, however. Bill Sharman had been installed as the new head coach, and on the afternoon of November 9, 1971, just nine games into the season, the legendary Elgin Baylor retired, finally accepting that his injuries would no longer allow him to play professional basketball. That very evening, the Lakers proceeded to win the first game of what would turn out to be a 33-game winning streak; the streak was snapped with a loss to the Bucks on January 9, 1972. The streak shattered the previous NBA record of 20 consecutive victories, which happened to have been set by the Bucks the year before. To this day, the Lakers' 33-game winning streak remains the longest winning streak in the history of any major North American professional sport. The Lakers set another record in 1972 by winning 69 games; this mark would stand for nearly a quarter of a century. Los Angeles led the league in scoring, rebounds, and assists, and Sharman was named Coach of the Year. Chamberlain led the NBA in field goal percentage and rebounding, and West led the NBA in assists. Not only that, but the Lakers at long last shook the monkey off their back, conquering the Knicks in the 1972 NBA Finals to claim their first NBA title since 1954 and their first since moving to Los Angeles. The Lakers would fall to the Knicks in the Finals in 1973, and Chamberlain, who had set a record for field-goal percentage that year, making 72.7% of his shots, announced his retirement. West followed suit a year after that and the Lakers bottomed out in 1975, finishing 30–52 and failing to make the playoffs for the first time in 17 years. 1975–1979: The Captain – Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Los Angeles acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. He won three MVP awards, one Finals MVP trophy and five championships with Los Angeles. Alcindor, now known as Kareem Abdul- Jabbar, wanted out of Milwaukee, and the Lakers acquired him in a trade. His first year in Los Angeles resulted in his fourth NBA Most Valuable Player Award, after he averaged 27.7 points per game, and led the NBA with 16.9 rebounds per game and 4.12 blocked shots per game. But the Lakers failed to make the playoffs again at 40–42 (meanwhile, Milwaukee went from last to first in their division despite finishing the season with a losing record). The Lakers returned to form in 1976–77, with the NBA's best record at 53–29. After beating the Warriors, they were swept 4–0 in the Western Conference Finals by Bill Walton's eventual NBA champion Portland Trail Blazers. December 9, 1977 saw one of the ugliest moments in professional sports history. Future Laker coach Rudy Tomjanovich, then of the Houston Rockets, ran onto the court in an attempt to break up a fight between the Lakers' Kermit Washington and the Rockets' Kevin Kunnert. Washington, in the corner of his eye, saw that there was an opposing player rushing toward him. Instinctively thinking that he was going to be attacked, Washington turned and landed a devastating blow to Tomjanovich's face, with the unsuspecting Tomjanovich running headlong directly into the punch. Tomjanovich was hit so hard that he has said that his first thought upon waking up was that the arena's scoreboard must have fallen from the ceiling onto him. The punch had cracked Tomjanovich's skull and nearly ended his career. He sat out the rest of the season, needing reconstructive surgery to repair his jaw, eye, and cheek. Some of those who witnessed the event said that the blow was so crushing that until they saw Tomjanovich moving as he lay on the floor, they feared that he might literally have been killed. Washington received a punishment of 60-game suspension and a fine, and the incident remains a dark chapter in Laker history. The shocking scene became the defining moment of not only the Rockets' 1977–78 season (a conference finals team the previous year, they collapsed into last place with a 28–54 record), but also of two players' professional careers. Tomjanovich spent the next five months in rehab, eventually returning to play as an NBA all-star. In 1977–78, the Lakers finished only 4th in their division at 45–37 and were sent home in the playoffs by the eventual champion SuperSonics. The following season saw a 47–35 record and third in the division. They beat the Denver Nuggets in the playoffs and once again fell to the SuperSonics. 1979–1991: Showtime Lakers Point guard Magic Johnson led the \\"Showtime\\" Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s. Before the 1979–80 season, Cooke sold the team to Dr. Jerry Buss, a Santa Monica real estate developer. That year also found the Lakers holding the top overall draft pick in the Western Conference, compensation for Goodrich's departure via free agency three years earlier to the New Orleans Jazz. At the time, the overall top pick in the draft was decided by a coin toss between the two teams with the top picks in each respective conference. The Eastern Conference team was the Chicago Bulls. The Lakers won the coin toss and selected Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, who had just led Michigan State University to the NCAA championship, and was along with Indiana State University forward Larry Bird one of the top prospects in the 1979 draft. Head coach Pat Riley engineered the fast-break offense to the trademark Showtime-era Lakers, earning four championships in the process. Just 14 games into the season, the Lakers' rookie head coach, Jack McKinney suffered a serious head injury in a bicycle accident. Assistant coach Paul Westhead stepped in as the team's new head coach. Officially, Westhead began his head coaching term serving as the \\"interim\\" head coach. But the severity of McKinney's injury meant a long convalescence, and that combined with Westhead's subsequent success in the job ultimately meant that McKinney would not return to the Lakers. Westhead's promotion to the head coaching position also meant there was an assistant's post open, for which the Lakers hired then-TV commentator Pat Riley to fill in. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a fantastic year (earning his sixth and final MVP award) as the Lakers won 60 regular season games. They beat the Suns and SuperSonics in the playoffs and then defeated Julius Erving's 76ers to win the NBA championship, behind an incredible Game 6 performance by the rookie Magic Johnson, who scored 42 points, pulled 15 rebounds, and dished 7 assists, while starting at center for an injured Abdul-Jabbar. That alone won Johnson the first of his three Finals MVP awards. The accomplishment would soon be followed by ugliness for the team, however. In a season that was marred by Johnson missing a large portion of time due to injury and a general state of unrest and dissension in the locker room, the Lakers stunningly fell in the first round of the 1981 NBA Playoffs to the Houston Rockets, who went on to the NBA Finals despite a 40–42 regular season record. The next season also began in rocky fashion, as Coach Westhead attempted to restructure the offense in a way that Magic Johnson opposed. Johnson was so upset that he demanded to be traded. Buss, however, sided with star player over head coach, and he fired Westhead just 11 games into the season. The fan reaction to Johnson for having triggered his head coach's firing was immediate and Johnson found himself roundly booed, even by the Lakers' home crowd in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, under the tutelage of new head coach Pat Riley, the Lakers returned to the finals that year by beating Phoenix and San Antonio in the playoffs. In the 1982 NBA Finals they defeated the 76ers in six games for their second league crown in three years. Furthermore, they found themselves again with the top overall draft pick, thanks to a trade two years earlier with the last-place Cleveland Cavaliers. This marked the first time that a reigning NBA champion also had the first pick in the draft. The Lakers used that pick to select James Worthy. Worthy had a strong rookie campaign, but he broke his leg at the end of the season and could only watch helplessly as the Lakers, also hobbled by injuries in the post-season to Bob McAdoo and Norm Nixon, were swept by the powerful 76ers, led by regular season and Finals MVP Moses Malone, in the 1983 NBA Finals. Byron Scott joined the team the next year, in a trade for the popular Norm Nixon, and the Lakers got off to a roaring start. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set the NBA all-time scoring record against Utah on April 5, 1984, topping Wilt Chamberlain's 31,419. The Lakers returned to the finals to face Larry Bird's Boston Celtics. The 1984 Finals were a brutal slugfest with games 1, 2, 5, and 7 played in the June heat and humidity of Boston Garden. The Celtics won the last match 111–102 to clinch the championship. James Worthy won the Finals MVP trophy after recording his only career triple double in Game 7 against Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals. By the 1984–85 season, the Lakers' so-called \\"Showtime\\" era was in full swing. Showtime was a fast-paced style of basketball, described as a mix of \\"no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams.\\" The team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year, this time by an NBA-record 20 games ahead of second-place Portland. They also set team records for field-goal percentage (.545) and assists (2,575). For the ninth time, they faced the Celtics in the finals. The championship series got off to a disastrous start for the Lakers, losing Game 1 of the Finals by a lopsided score of 148–114, in what is now remembered as the \\"Memorial Day Massacre\\". But the Lakers were resilient and behind 38-year- old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, they were finally able to topple Boston in six games. Abdul-Jabbar proceeded to dismember the Celtics with his deadly skyhook move, and Los Angeles won Game 6 111–100 in Boston Garden, one of the greatest triumphs in franchise history. The Lakers gained their first ever Finals victory over the Celtics, and they were the only visiting team to ever do this in Boston Garden. The Lakers were expected to meet Boston in the finals again the next year, and started the 1985–86 season on a tear, going 24–3. They finished with 62 wins and topped the record they set the year before by winning their fifth-straight division title by 22 games. However, the Houston Rockets had their own plans for the playoffs. Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson overwhelmed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Rockets won the series when Sampson hit a 12-foot back to the basket jumper as time expired in Game 5 at The Forum. Concerned over Abdul-Jabbar's age (he was now 39), Pat Riley re- centered the offense around Magic Johnson. The strategy worked, and the Lakers accumulated 65 wins, the second-most in franchise history up to that point. Johnson also won his first MVP award. Although the Showtime Lakers were famous for their scoring, they were also a great defensive team. Michael Cooper won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1987. After passing the Nuggets, Warriors, and SuperSonics in the playoffs, the Lakers headed to the Finals for the sixth time since 1980. Johnson then notched his last Finals MVP award as the Lakers defeated their arch-rival Celtics in the finals, highlighted by Johnson's running \\"baby hook\\" shot to win Game 4 at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining. This time, the decisive game was at home, giving the Los Angeles fans their first-ever chance to witness in person their team conquer the hated Celtics. The 40-year-old Kareem Abdul-Jabbar still managed to deliver a punch in the Finals as he and Magic Johnson rolled over Boston. The Finals proved easier than expected because Los Angeles was well-rested after an easy trip through the playoffs while their opponent was tired and battered by injuries after a brutal seven-game ECF battle with Detroit. At the victory celebration afterward, Riley boldly guaranteed that the Lakers would repeat as champions the next year, something no team had done since the Celtics in 1969. Abdul-Jabbar also stated that he would return for the 1987–88 season to contribute to Riley's promise of back-to-back titles. With every team in the league now gunning for them, the Lakers still found a way to win, taking their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title, and subsequently meeting Isiah Thomas and the physical Detroit Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals, even after going the distance against the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks in the second round and Conference Finals, respectively. The series went to seven games and the Lakers squeaked out a victory because of an injury to Isiah Thomas as well as James Worthy's Game 7 triple double, which earned him a Finals MVP award and cemented his nickname of \\"Big Game James\\". By the narrowest of margins, the Lakers had delivered on Riley's guarantee. With age quickly catching up to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson had to carry the offense. It worked, and as the latter said afterwards \\"We kept coming back. This was the hardest championship of them all.\\" It did not look to be the beginning of the end, as the 1988–89 Lakers won their division yet again and Magic Johnson collected his second MVP award. The team then swept their first three playoff series (against the Trail Blazers, SuperSonics and Suns respectively) to set up a rematch with the Pistons in the Finals. But the \\"three-peat\\" was not to be, as Johnson and Byron Scott were taken out of commission by hamstring injuries. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once again had to lead the offense, but the Pistons proved more than he could handle. In Game 4, the 42-year-old center made a bank shot at 1:42 seconds for the final two points of his career. As he walked off the floor for the last time, everyone in the Forum, including the Pistons bench, stood up and applauded. The Lakers seemed to adapt well to Kareem's absence. New center Vlade Divac helped the team to a 63-win season in 1989–90 and their ninth consecutive division title, and Johnson took another MVP award. However, the Phoenix Suns had the Lakers' number that year in the second round of the NBA Playoffs, defeating the Lakers in a surprisingly easy five games. Pat Riley stepped down as coach and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy as head coach. Michael Cooper, another great from the Showtime years, also retired. Johnson became the NBA's all-time assist leader, surpassing Oscar Robertson the next season, as Dunleavy's new philosophy incorporated a slow and deliberate style, instead of the fast breaking Showtime style of the Pat Riley era. After a slow start the Lakers finished with a 58–24 record, defeated the strong Portland Trail Blazers 4–2 for the conference championship and returned to the NBA Finals. Unfortunately for the Lakers, though, a new dynasty was just beginning elsewhere, as Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls under second-year coach Phil Jackson won the first of their six championships by ousting the Lakers in a 4–1 series. 1991–1996: Lean years On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson made the shocking announcement that he had been diagnosed with the HIV virus and was thus retiring from the NBA at the age of 32. The 1991–92 Lakers struggled with the news of Magic's retirement and serious injuries to key players. They did manage to win 43 games and qualify for the playoffs for a then-NBA-record 16th consecutive time, thanks in no small way to the offseason recruitment of guard Sedale Threatt. However, playing without the injured James Worthy and Sam Perkins, the Lakers were overmatched by a powerful Portland Trail Blazers team and lost the first round series three games to one. That series featured one of the Lakers' \\"home\\" games being played in Las Vegas due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Dunleavy decided to leave the Lakers prior to the 1992–93 season to take charge of the Milwaukee Bucks' organization. Long-time Laker assistant coach Randy Pfund was promoted to replace him. The 1992–93 Lakers fought off an early injury to guard Byron Scott and posted a respectable 33–29 record over the first 61 games. The Lakers then traded Sam Perkins to the Seattle SuperSonics for Benoit Benjamin and the rights to rookie Doug Christie. The trade upset an already fragile team as they closed the season with a poor 6–14 run, but did manage to qualify for the playoffs. The Lakers surprised the basketball world by winning the first two games of the series against the powerful Phoenix Suns on the road, including a 35-point performance by Sedale Threatt in Game 1. However the Lakers lost the final three games of the series, including an overtime thriller on the road in the fifth and final game, with Phoenix prevailing over the Lakers three games to two. Vlade Divac and draft pick Nick Van Exel led the team in scoring the next year, but it was rough going. After losing veteran players Byron Scott and A. C. Green to free agency and with James Worthy in the final season of his career, the team posted a 33–49 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in 17 years. The Lakers did make a late playoff push when Pfund was fired and Magic Johnson took over as head coach. Unfortunately for Laker fans, Johnson went on to lose the final ten games of the season, which is to date the worst losing streak in franchise history. Realizing that he was not cut out for coaching, Johnson stepped aside and the Lakers appointed Del Harris as their head coach going into the 1994–1995 season. The Lakers were one of the most improved teams in 1994–95, posting a 48–34 record and returning to the playoffs after a one-year absence. The vast improvement was due to several reasons, including the coaching of Harris, the improved play of second year guard Nick Van Exel, the maturing of veteran players Vlade Divac and Elden Campbell, and the offseason signing of Cedric Ceballos and drafting of rookie Eddie Jones. Ceballos went on to record the first 50-point game by a Laker player in over 20 years. The Lakers won their first playoff series in the post-Magic era, beating the talented Seattle SuperSonics three games to one before losing to the Western Conference's number one seed San Antonio Spurs four games to two. Harris was named Coach of the Year and Jerry West won the NBA Executive of the Year Award. The Lakers brought back essentially the same team in 1995–96 and had posted a 24–18 record after 42 games. On January 30, 1996 Magic Johnson returned to the Lakers as a reserve power forward and registered 19 points, 10 assists and 8 rebounds in his first game back against the Golden State Warriors. Johnson played well in the first few weeks of his return and sparked the Lakers to a 29–11 record while he was back in uniform. However, as the season progressed the wheels began to fall off as Johnson's age and time away from the game began to affect his performance. Team captain Cedric Ceballos was suspended by the team, Nick Van Exel was suspended for seven games for shoving a referee, and Johnson even lost his cool, getting ejected from a late-season game for bumping an official. The imploding Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the defending champion Houston Rockets three games to one. Magic Johnson retired again following the season. 1996–2016: The Kobe Bryant era1996–2004: O'Neal and Bryant dynasty= During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent and former Magic Center Shaquille O'Neal. Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.Lazenby, pp. 315–9. \\"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\\", O'Neal later said.Lazenby, p. 353. They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher. During the 1996–97 season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry. O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury. O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games. The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs. O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969. Despite a NBA-record 7-for-7 three- point shooting performance from Horry in game 2, the Lakers lost the next round four games to one to the Utah Jazz. In the following 1997–98 season, the Lakers were the only team without a player over the age of 30 and were joined by Rick Fox from the Boston Celtics. They started off with the best start in franchise history, 11–0. Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games, finishing 61–21, and passing Seattle in the standings. O'Neal – although missing 20 games due to an abdominal injury – was dominant, finishing only second to Michael Jordan in scoring, and leading the league in field-goal percentage (.584). The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first-round of the play-offs. The following round, Seattle took a one- game lead, with the Lakers responding with four straight wins, taking the series. They were swept again by the Jazz in the Conference Finals. During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets to acquire Glen Rice.Lazenby, p. 350. Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets, and the flamboyant Dennis Rodman joined the team, though he was cut after just 23 games. The team also acquired J. R. Reid, and B. J. Armstrong. Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.Lazenby, pp. 354–5. The team finished 31–19 in the shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. Los Angeles defeated Houston 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round with game 4 being the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum. The 1999–2000 season brought upon four huge changes: a new home floor at Staples Center (which they share with the city rival Los Angeles Clippers), newer, more modern jerseys replacing the ones worn by the Lakers since the late 70's, a new coach in Phil Jackson, and a new system: the triangle offense. The new philosophy proved to be potent, as the Lakers started off strong, winning 31 of their first 36 games. They also were able to string together winning streaks of 16, 19, and 11 games, becoming only the third team in NBA history to have three double-digit streaks in one season. Despite topping the league with a 67–15 record in the regular season, the Lakers found themselves struggling in the playoffs, needing all five games to knock off the Sacramento Kings and coming back from 15 points down in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against Portland. The Indiana Pacers, coached by the Lakers' old nemesis, Larry Bird, proved to be slightly less of a problem, however, and in six games, the Lakers claimed their first NBA championship since 1988. Shaquille O'Neal picked up both MVP and Finals MVP awards in 2000. Having also shared the 2000 All-Star Game MVP award, he was only the third player in NBA history to win all three awards in the same season. Kobe Bryant was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team, the youngest player to earn the honor. Bryant had blossomed under Coach Jackson, as had Lakers role players such as Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and Robert Horry. Phil Jackson coached the Lakers to five championships, all with Kobe Bryant, three with Shaquille O'Neal and two with Pau Gasol. The Lakers certainly looked the favorite to repeat the following year, but they had a tougher time of it, accumulating 16 losses by the All-Star break, one more than they had had the entire season before. Nevertheless, they pulled together and were able to edge Sacramento for the division title. Then the team went on a tear, sweeping the first three playoff series. The Lakers-Spurs series in the conference finals was the most lopsided conference finals series in NBA History, with the Lakers winning by an average of 22 points per game. The Lakers lost the first game of the NBA Finals to Philadelphia, but that only proved to be a temporary blip, as they swept the next four games to claim their second consecutive championship. O'Neal collected his second Finals MVP and Derek Fisher set a playoff record with 15 three-pointers in the series against San Antonio. The Lakers concluded the 2001 playoffs with a staggering 15–1 record, the best single season playoff record in NBA history. Would a third consecutive championship be possible? The Lakers certainly thought so, and they started strongly in the 2001–2002 season, winning 16 of their first 17, but an arthritic toe hobbled O'Neal for much of the season and the Lakers lost the division crown to the Sacramento Kings. Thus began a memorable post-season for Robert Horry, who sealed the first series against Portland with a game-winning three-pointer, enabling the Lakers to sweep. The Lakers followed with a 4–1 defeat of San Antonio in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers faced the immensely talented Sacramento Kings, a team many believed was ready to finally make it over the hump and get to the NBA Finals. The series, which will most likely go down as one of the most exciting Conference Finals in NBA history, was neck and neck throughout. The Kings were only seconds away from taking a commanding 3–1 series lead in Game 4 in Los Angeles before a 3-pointer at the buzzer by Robert Horry saved the Lakers, tied the series at 2–2, and enabled the Lakers to push the series to a seventh and deciding game in Sacramento. Game 7 proved to be as dramatic as the previous games in the series, with the Lakers eventually defeating the Kings in overtime and advancing to the NBA Finals. The championship series against the New Jersey Nets was a mere formality, as the Lakers swept all four games in one of the most lopsided NBA Finals ever. By securing their third straight NBA Championship, the Lakers of 2000–2002 earned their place in NBA history. O'Neal won his third consecutive Finals MVP award joining only Michael Jordan as players to have achieved such honors, and Jackson won his ninth championship as a head coach, tying Celtics legend Red Auerbach, while surpassing Pat Riley as the coach with the most playoff victories. Kobe Bryant won two Finals MVP trophies with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010. The Laker juggernaut seemed unstoppable, and a fourth consecutive championship was in their sights. However, they started off poorly, with Shaquille O'Neal missing the first 12 games while recovering from toe surgery, and then taking time to get into game shape. At Christmas, the team was 11–19, but then Kobe Bryant turned in the best sustained performance of his career, setting NBA records for youngest player to reach 10,000 points, most three-pointers in a game (12), most three-pointers in a half (8), and most consecutive three-pointers in a game (9). Additionally, he set a team record for most points in a half (42), scored 40+ points in 9 consecutive games (joining Chamberlain and Jordan), scored 35+ points in 13 consecutive games (trailing only Chamberlain), became the third player to average 40 points in a month, and became the first Laker to record a triple-double in consecutive games since Magic Johnson in 1991. The Lakers finished the season with a 50–32 record, their 27th 50+ victory season since moving to Los Angeles. In the playoffs, the pivotal moment was a familiar one. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Lakers were already missing one of their tri-captains in Rick Fox, who had torn a ligament in his left foot during the Minnesota series. San Antonio led by as many as 25 points in the game before the Lakers' poise and confidence once again emerged down the stretch. Down 18 in the final period, Los Angeles dug deep and rallied, leaving themselves a two-point deficit with a mere 14.7 ticks left on the clock. The game would come down to a familiar hero in a familiar situation. Following the inbounds pass and with 3.6 seconds remaining in the game, Robert Horry let fly the potential game-winning three- pointer – only this time the Lakers saw the ball go in, then inexplicably rim out. A shot that had always fallen in the past would not this time around. Rather than rejoicing in another last-second victory that would have given them a 3–2 series lead and a chance to finish the Spurs off back home in Los Angeles, the Lakers instead faced the dejection of having been so close, but now facing a 3–2 deficit and now being on the brink of elimination. The Spurs did not waste their chance to finish off the Lakers. They swarmed the Lakers in Game 6 and put an end to the Lakers' dreams of a fourth consecutive NBA championship. Determined to reclaim the title in Dr. Buss' 25th year of ownership, the Lakers brought in free agents Karl Malone and Gary Payton, and started the 2003–04 season with a bang, winning 20 of their first 25 games, during which time Malone became the oldest player to record a triple-double. But then Malone went down with a knee injury, and other ailments to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant soon followed, leaving Payton to lead the younger players in an offensive system with which he was not particularly familiar. Additionally the team faced the ongoing distraction of Bryant's sexual assault case and the sniping between O'Neal and Bryant which had ensued after Bryant was charged. Still, the team managed to keep things together long enough for everyone to recover, closing the season in style with 14 victories in 17 games, and a Pacific Division title thanks to Bryant's two buzzer-beating three-pointers against Portland: one to tie the game at the end of regulation, and the second to win it in double-overtime. Without Horry in the playoffs, it was up to Fisher to save the team with a game-winning buzzer-beater. Again the Lakers were down 0–2 to San Antonio (at this time, the defending champions) in the semifinals. Again they were able to tie the series two games a piece at home. Again they were down as Game 5 drew to a close. Fisher's miraculous basket, coming off of an inbounds play that began with just 0.4 seconds left in the game, would achieve acclaim as one of the NBA's most amazing playoff moments. This time, the Lakers returned home for Game 6 indeed relishing the joy of their improbable win, and they took advantage of their chance to finish off the Spurs, taking the game to advance to the Western Conference Finals. After storming through the number one seed Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers were expected to run roughshod over their NBA Finals opponents, the Detroit Pistons. But it wound up being the other way around, with the Pistons winning the series easily in five games, playing a team-oriented game featuring a particularly stingy defense. =2004–2007: Scoring machine: The Kobe era= The following summer after the 2003–04 season, the Lakers imploded. Jackson was burned out, and the Lakers' management was unwilling to raise his salary from $6 million a year to $12 million that he wanted to continue. Also, assistant coach Tex Winter said Jackson announced at the 2004 All-Star break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.Lazenby 2006, p.423 The long-simmering tensions between Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant finally came to a head. When Jackson was not retained as coach (a move many believed to have been orchestrated by Bryant), O'Neal demanded a trade and it was granted; he went to the Miami Heat in return for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grant. Bryant tested the free-agent market, apparently coming very close to signing with the Los Angeles Clippers before deciding to stay with the Lakers. Jackson retired to his ranch in Montana and Rudy Tomjanovich came in as the new head coach. Gary Payton was dealt to Boston and Karl Malone retired after undergoing knee surgery, but not before the possibility of his return was eliminated when he and Bryant had a falling-out. Despite all of the offseason movement, the Lakers did manage a 24–19 start at the beginning of the 2004–05 season, but it was at this time Tomjanovich left the team for health concerns. The Lakers struggled without Tomjanovich, but were still able to manage a 32–29 record and were in position to make the playoffs. However, the Lakers were not able to overcome late season injuries to Bryant and Odom, and went on to lose 19 of their last 21 games, finishing with a record of 34–48. With that record, the Lakers missed the playoffs for the first time in 11 years and this was the fifth time in franchise history to do so. Despite all of this, Bryant continued to set records, including becoming the youngest player to reach 14,000 points, and setting a franchise record with 43 consecutive made free throws. The team also made 100% of their free throws three times, the first time since 1991–92. But all of that amounted to little, as the Lakers ended the season below .500 and missed the playoffs. The 2005–06 season would see the Lakers reunite with Phil Jackson. Jackson's year off, including vacationing in Australia, left him rejuvenated, whereas the Lakers' struggle in 2004–05 caused Jerry Buss to reconsider his willingness to meet Jackson's salary demands. Although many have felt Kobe Bryant desired Jackson's departure in the first place, and though Jackson was subsequently critical of Bryant publicly, Bryant indicated that he welcomed Jackson's return, and the move left fans very optimistic about the Lakers season. Indeed, no public disagreements between the two surfaced throughout their first season reunited, and the player-coach relationship appeared to remain solid. In the off-season, the Lakers' most significant player personnel moves had been acquiring Kwame Brown from Washington in exchange for Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins, and drafting center Andrew Bynum straight from high school. After the previous season's poor showing, most felt that simply making the playoffs would be an accomplishment. The new Laker team seemed somewhat modeled after Jackson's 1990s Chicago Bulls dynasty which had garnered 6 championships. Lamar Odom, a gifted facilitator forward, was also seen by some to be a \\"Scottie Pippen\\" type of player to complement Kobe Bryant's talents. After a shaky start, the team's chemistry appeared to improve dramatically during the latter half of the season. The Lakers managed to put forth more consistent efforts as the regular season drew to a close. The team's late season surge was enough to secure a playoff berth and allay some of their fans' immediate concerns about the team. They played the second seeded Phoenix Suns, and after Bryant hit two clutch shots to win Game 4 at Los Angeles, they appeared to be en route to an upset with a 3–1 series lead, which would set up a \\"Hallway Series\\" in the second round against the Los Angeles Clippers, who had already advanced by ousting the Denver Nuggets. However, Phoenix, led by 2006 MVP Steve Nash, was able to rally. They would win at home 114–97 in Game 5, win at Los Angeles 126–118 in overtime of Game 6 (almost losing in regulation), and blow out in Game 7 121–90 at Phoenix. The Lakers trailed 60–45 at halftime of Game 7. Bryant had 23 points at halftime but would score only one point on three shots in the second half. A number of critics, such as Bill Simmons suggested that Bryant, with his team trailing by so much, should have attempted more shots in the second half; some, such as Charles Barkley even suggested that Bryant refused to shoot to \\"prove a point\\" about the inferior scoring ability of his teammates. Bryant and coach Phil Jackson denied this, with both stating that Kobe was following the halftime gameplan by getting others involved.Next Game Plan May Not Include Kobe – Los Angeles Times During the 2006 off-season, the Lakers drafted UCLA point guard Jordan Farmar. To the surprise of many fans, the Lakers started the season strongly with key victories over teams like the Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, and San Antonio Spurs. However, things started going downhill after a slew of injuries to Lamar Odom, Kwame Brown, and Luke Walton. Kobe Bryant was suspended twice for striking opponents, and some started to question if he was a \\"dirty player.\\" Outraged at these criticisms, Bryant went on a record-setting 4-game streak of scoring at least 50 points. The Lakers managed to grab the seventh seed, but lost to the Phoenix Suns 4–1 in the first round. Following the 2006–07 season the future of Kobe Bryant's career as a Laker fell into doubt, when he demanded to be traded.ESPN – Bryant asks for trade, then backtracks slightly – NBA For a week he tiraded and the situation escalated when a videotape about him was released. The video recorded him saying that the Lakers should have traded Andrew Bynum for Jason Kidd. Bryant insulted Bynum and was critical of general manager Mitch Kupchak. Roster management decided to resign Derek Fisher, a past hero, but the Lakers would enter the season frustrated and with question marks. =2007–2013: Bryant and Gasol era= The Lakers started the 2007–08 season surprisingly well. Fueled by the emergence of Andrew Bynum as a main option at center, the Lakers would even enjoy being the number one team in the Western Conference for three days. Capped by an early season trade for Trevor Ariza, rumors of Bryant wanting to leave Los Angeles were finally beginning to die. However, before the Lakers could savor their new success, Bynum would go down with a knee injury that would take him out for the remainder of the season. Suddenly, the contending Lakers would lose three straight games. The remainder of the season looked bleak for the Lakers, who were struggling to win games. It seemed that injuries, once again, would cripple another Laker season. On February 1, 2008, the Lakers dealt the unpopular Kwame Brown, rookie Javaris Crittenton, veteran Aaron McKie, the draft rights to Marc Gasol, and first round picks in 2008 and 2010 for Spaniard all-star forward Pau Gasol (Marc's older brother) and a second round draft choice in 2010.NBA Playoffs: Gasol – 'One of the greatest trades ever' With the Lakers now having a center and power forward who are both 7 feet tall, analysts have referred to Gasol and Bynum as \\"the twin towers\\", similar to famous NBA duos such as Tim Duncan and David Robinson, Patrick Ewing and Bill Cartwright, and the original named duo of Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson. Even while waiting for Bynum's return, the Lakers were playing very well and got a second taste of being best in the Western Conference. With Kobe Bryant leading the charge with his MVP-caliber season, the month of April was very triumphant for the Lakers, who quickly surged to the top of Western Conference. Aided by Gasol's versatile abilities and Lamar Odom's stellar play as a third option, the Lakers clinched their playoff berth for the 55th time in their 60 years with the league, won the Pacific Division from the Phoenix Suns (their first since Shaq left in 2004), and clinched the number one seed in the Western Conference for the first time since the 1999–2000 season. Bryant was also named the 2007–2008 NBA Most Valuable Player. Entering the post-season, the Lakers would post a 12–3 record entering the Finals. However, problems suddenly arose when the Lakers faced the Boston Celtics in the 2008 NBA Finals. The Celtics, the best-record team during the regular season, convincingly beat the Lakers 4–2 in the best of 7 series. In the 2009 season, the Lakers had only one goal in mind: \\"ring\\", their huddle chant throughout the year. In January, the Lakers would again lose Andrew Bynum to injury. Bynum would return for the last few games of the regular season, and the Lakers ended up with a record of 65–17. In the playoffs, Los Angeles easily beat the Utah Jazz in the first round, but faced a tough Houston Rockets team the next round. Though the Rockets stunned the Staples Center crowd with a Game 1 win, the Lakers took the series in seven, with most games of the series ending as a blowout. The Denver Nuggets kept the next round tight for L.A., until the Lakers blew them out in Game 6, winning the conference championship. In the Finals against the Orlando Magic, several games were close, but the Lakers still won 4–1 and were crowned NBA Champions for the first time in 7 years. Kobe Bryant was named the Finals MVP. Five championship banners were added to the rafters of Staples Center during Phil Jackson's tenure with the Lakers. On July 3, 2009, the Lakers signed Houston Rockets forward Ron Artest to a five-year contract to replace Lakers forward Trevor Ariza who signed with the Rockets. The Lakers once again won the Western Conference and made it to their third straight finals. In the 2010 NBA Finals, the Lakers were rematched with the Boston Celtics. Faced against much of the same roster that they had played with in 2008, the series played out very tightly, with both teams trading wins for the first four games. After the Celtics won a decisive game 5, the series moved back to Los Angeles where the Lakers would win in a rout. Coming down to the fifth game 7 in the rivalry's history, Boston played well in the early goings of the match. However, the Lakers would rally in the fourth quarter to a raging Staples Center crowd. Led by Bryant and Gasol's rebounding, and with clutch shots from Ron Artest and Derek Fisher, the Lakers would win their franchise's sixteenth NBA championship. Bryant was awarded his second consecutive Finals Most Valuable Player Award. In the 2011 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers advanced past the first round by defeating the New Orleans Hornets 4–2. However, the Dallas Mavericks swept the Lakers and ended Phil Jackson's career with a 36-point blowout in Game 4. After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach. On December 8, 2011, the New Orleans Hornets, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets agreed to a trade that would send Chris Paul to Los Angeles. NBA commissioner David Stern nullified the trade. The decision was met with severe backlash by players and sportswriters. The league had acquired the Hornets from former owner George Shinn, and the commissioner's office has final authority over all management decisions. Several of the other owners, also opposed the deal (most notably Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert). At the end of the trade deadline, the Lakers traded long time point guard Derek Fisher to Houston for Jordan Hill. During the 2012 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers nearly blew a 3–1 series lead to the Denver Nuggets, before closing them out in the seventh game. Entering the semifinals, the Lakers would lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–1. Entering the 2012–13 season, the Lakers made key changes in their roster, trading several draft picks to the Phoenix Suns for two time MVP Steve Nash, and trading Andrew Bynum and a first round draft pick in a four team deal that netted them three time defensive player of the year Dwight Howard. After a 1–4 start to the season, Brown was fired as head coach. The Lakers first contacted Jackson to replace Brown; however, talks stalled as Jackson requested time to consider the position. The next day, the team talked with Mike D'Antoni and signed him to a multi-year contract in a unanimous decision by the front office. They felt that D'Antoni's fast-paced style of play made him a \\"great fit\\" for the team, more suitable than Jackson's structured triangle offense. Jerry Buss' preference has always been for the Lakers to have a wide-open offense. D'Antoni was reunited with Nash, who won two MVPs in four season under D'Antoni while with the Suns. Bryant was also familiar with D'Antoni; Bryant as a child knew him when D'Antoni was a star in Italy and Bryant's father was also playing there. Bryant grew close with D'Antoni during their time with the United States national team. D'Antoni's coaching debut with the Lakers was delayed as he recovered from knee replacement surgery he had weeks earlier. Bernie Bickerstaff, who was the Lakers' interim coach after Brown was fired, continued in that role after D'Antoni was hired. He was 4–1 as the interim coach, winning his last two as D'Antoni started leading team practices. D'Antoni predicted that the Lakers, then 3–5 and ranked 20th in scoring with 96.5 points per game, should instead be scoring \\"110–115 points a game\\". He wanted to revive Showtime. On November 20, he coached his first game—nine days after he was hired—in a 95–90 win against the Brooklyn Nets. On February 18, 2013 the Lakers franchise and the sports world were saddened by the death of Dr. Jerry Buss at the age of 80. In their first game after his passing and following a speech of tribute from Kobe Bryant along with a moment of silence observed by the crowd, an emotional and inspired Lakers team defeated their archrival Celtics. Very fitting in that this was the team Dr. Buss most enjoyed seeing his Lakers beat. With 10 championships and 16 finals appearances during his tenure as owner beginning in 1979 until his death, Dr. Buss was the most successful owner in the history of North American sports. Despite all the struggles, including an injury to Kobe in a controversial March loss to Atlanta in which they were not awarded 2 free throws after Kobe's injury, while it was later admitted they should have, the Lakers made the playoffs as the 7th seed at 45–37, only clinching a playoff spot in the last game. Their first round matchup against San Antonio was nowhere to being close as the Spurs won all four games easily. =2013–2016: Bryant's final years= In the 2013–14 season, the Lakers started 10–9 before finishing 27–55 and missing the playoffs for just the seventh time since moving to Los Angeles. The Lakers won the rights to the seventh pick of the 2014 NBA draft with which they selected Julius Randle, a freshman power forward from the University of Kentucky. The Washington Wizards agreed to sell the Lakers the rights to the 46th pick of the draft for cash considerations. The Lakers drafted Jordan Clarkson with the 46th pick of the draft and agreed terms for a two-year deal. The Lakers finished their 2014–15 season with a record of 21–61, missing the playoffs, and earning the worst record in franchise history. The Lakers obtained the second pick of the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA Draft Lottery where they drafted Ohio State University freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. They also drafted Larry Nance, Jr. with the 27th pick and Anthony Brown with the 34th pick of the 2015 NBA draft. Early in the 2015–16 season, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season. In Bryant's final game, he gave the Lakers one more 60-point game in a 101–96 victory over the Utah Jazz. The Lakers were eliminated from playoff contention for the third straight season, the ninth time total since moving to Los Angeles, and a new team record for worst finish at 17–65. It was the first postseason drought for the Lakers to surpass two straight misses in the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons. 2016–2018: Post-Bryant era  On April 24, 2016 the Lakers announced they had fired coach Byron Scott. He was replaced by Warriors assistant and former Lakers forward Luke Walton. Soon thereafter, the Lakers won the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft and selected Brandon Ingram, a 6'9\\" freshman small forward from Duke University. On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations. On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager. In the 2017 NBA draft the Lakers had the second overall pick yet again, and selected Lonzo Ball, a 6'6\\" freshman point guard from UCLA. In a draft-day trade, the Lakers also acquired Brook Lopez and 27th overall selection Kyle Kuzma from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Russell and Timofey Mozgov. The 2017–18 season saw another improvement with a 35–47 record, nine more wins than the previous season.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2018.html In addition, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. were traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and the 25th overall selection in the 2018 NBA draft. That draft pick was used to select center Moritz Wagner from Michigan during the 2018 NBA draft. 2018-present: Back to relevance2018-present: The LeBron James era= On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a 4-year, $154 million contract. The Lakers sustained several injuries during the 2018–19 season, and did not qualify for the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. On April 9, 2019, Magic Johnson stepped down as the president of basketball operations, while the Lakers finished the 2018–19 season with a record of 37–45. On April 12, the Lakers and Luke Walton agreed to part ways after three seasons. On May 13, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as head coach. On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft. =2020: Return to the playoffs and 17th championship= During the 2019–20 season, the Lakers made the playoffs for first time since 2013. Leading up to this however Kobe Bryant passed away on 26th January. The team qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs with a 52–19 record as the first seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2010 and 17th time in franchise history. Again the team would be beset with tribulations with the entire season in doubt due to the coronavirus pandemic with several NBA players testing positive. The season was resumed months later in Orlando in Disneyworld under special circumstances, played in the same arena without fans and few spectators, where the teams would spend months without leave (Over 3 months for the finalists). In the first round they faced the Portland Trail Blazers, after losing Game 1, the Lakers then eliminated the Trail Blazers by winning four straight, it was the Lakers first series win in 8 years. The following round, Houston Rockets took a one-game lead, with the Lakers responding with four straight wins again, taking the series and advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2010. The Lakers then beat the Denver Nuggets 4-1 to move on to their first NBA Finals in exactly a decade. In those Finals the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games to win the franchise's 17th NBA title, tying them with the Celtics for most championships in league history.

Musical style The band's songs are characterized by lush arrangements, eclectic instrumentation, and Carpenter's lyrical themes of love, death, religion, and American mythologies. The music draws heavily from disparate genres including experimental music, modern classical, cabaret, circus music, Appalachian string music, bluegrass music, old-time music, Southern Gospel and funereal music. \\\\- Since 2005, Carpenter has been developing a \\"Weird American Gothic\\" trilogy of concept albums, starting with Dreamland. HistoryEarly years and Ringleaders (2002–2004)= In 2001, Carpenter moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and formed a collaboration with the tenor banjo player Brandon Seabrook, which led to the first incarnation of Beat Circus, originally named Beat Science. Aided by Jim Hobbs (saxophone), Jerome Deupree (drums), Alec K. Redfearn (accordion), Ron Caswell (tuba) and Leigh Calabrese (musical saw), the group was a contemporary free improvisation instrumental ensemble which used circus music as a jumping off point. After a summer-long residency in Cambridge in 2003, Carpenter recorded the band's first album, Ringleaders Revolt, which was released by Innova Records in 2004. \\\\- =Dreamland (2005–2006)= In 2005, Carpenter steered the band in an entirely different direction with the development of Dreamland, a 150-page through-composed score for nine musicians containing songs based around a stage play treatment of a story involving the turn-of-the-century Coney Island theme park which burned in a devastating fire in 1911. Dreamland began a shift away from instrumental music to narrative songs about children, dreams, fatherhood, revenge and redemption. To develop the Dreamland score, Carpenter formed a second incarnation of Beat Circus with Matt McLaren (drums), a long- time collaborator of Cuneiform Records label-mate Redfearn, Kaethe Hostetter from Boston, Curtis Hasselbring (trombone), Briggan Krauss of Sex Mob (saxophone), and original members Redfearn, Caswell and Seabrook. In 2006, Carpenter enlisted the New York City-based producer Martin Bisi to record and mix Dreamland in Brooklyn. Dreamland was released on Cuneiform Records in January 2008 and announced as the first installation in Carpenter's \\"Weird American Gothic\\" trilogy. =Boy from Black Mountain (2007–2009)= In late 2006 near the completion of recording Dreamland, Carpenter's son was diagnosed with autism. After coping with this, Carpenter began writing a song cycle for the second part of the trilogy, entitled Boy From Black Mountain. With the departure of Redfearn and McLaren, who wished to focus on their band The Eyesores, Carpenter formed the third incarnation of Beat Circus in 2007, casting himself as the lead vocalist with Paran Amirinazari(violin) and Jordan Voelker (viola) as background vocalists, and introducing a rockabilly-style rhythm section composed of Paul Dilley (upright bass), Andrew Stern (guitar/banjo) and Gavin McCarthy of Karate (drums). In 2008, Carpenter enlisted the producer Sean Slade to record Boy From Black Mountain in Boston. Later that year, the New York City-based producer and engineer Bryce Goggin was brought on to mix the album. Boy From Black Mountain marked yet another shift in direction, inspired by Carpenter's Southern heritage, Southern Gospel music, bluegrass music and Southern Gothic writers, and was released by Cuneiform Records in September 2009. \\\\- =These Wicked Things (2014–present)= In 2014, Carpenter was commissioned by the Berkeley Repertory Theater to write music for The Barbary Coast, a play based on the true crime book by Herbert Asbury about the rise of San Francisco during the Gold Rush era. Two years after a week-long residency in Berkeley, California, the band recorded a few of the songs from the play and several other new songs and instrumentals for These Wicked Things, the third and final part of Carpenter's Weird American Gothic trilogy. Recorded in Boston and mixed in Tucson with Craig Schumacher, the record bridges a number of disparate genres including experimental music, cowpunk, post-punk, Mexican folk music, mariachi music and \\"spaghetti western\\" and giallo film scores.

Early life Virginia Dell Cassidy was born in Bodcaw, Arkansas. She was the only child of James Eldridge Cassidy (1898–1957), the town iceman (later a grocer), and Edith (née Grisham) Cassidy (1901–1968), a nurse. Her family moved to Hope, Arkansas when she was a toddler. During her high school years, she worked as a waitress at a local restaurant. Following her graduation from high school, Virginia moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, to study to be a nurse like her mother. During her training in Shreveport, she met her first husband, William Jefferson Blythe, Jr., whom she married in a civil ceremony in 1943, just before he shipped out for World War II military duty. Upon completion of her training, she returned to Hope, Arkansas. When her husband was discharged, he picked her up and they moved for four months to Chicago, Illinois. She moved back to her parents' house while she and William were in the process of getting a new home in the Hope area. While William was on his way back to Hope, he was killed in an automobile accident, three months before Bill Clinton's birth. Virginia later spent time in New Orleans, Louisiana training to be a nurse anesthetist. In 1950, Virginia married car salesman Roger Clinton Sr., the father of the second of her two boys, Roger Jr. Clinton was an alcoholic and was physically and mentally abusive to Virginia and her boys. He did not adopt Bill, but Bill took his surname legally in 1962. He told his mother that it would be easier if they all had the same last name. Roger Sr. and Virginia divorced in 1962 but remarried each other a few months later. Last years Following Roger's death from cancer in 1967, Virginia Clinton married hairdresser Jeff Dwire in 1969; he subsequently died of complications of diabetes in 1974. On January 17, 1982, she married Richard Kelley (1915–2007), an executive at a food distribution brokerage firm. Their marriage lasted until her death on January 6, 1994 from complications of breast cancer, at the age of 70, at her home in Hot Springs, Arkansas. She died just under a year after her son became the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. She is buried alongside her first husband William J. Blythe at Rose Hill Cemetery in Hope, Arkansas. Before her death, she was interviewed by Connie Chung and spoke about both of her sons.

Originating as a kind of Breton branle, it was adapted to courtly use in the 16th century and is found frequently in 18th-century French opera and ballet, particularly in pastoral scenes, and latterly also in baroque instrumental suites of dances. In English the passepied has been spelled \\"paspy\\" as well as \\"paspie\\" or \\"paspe\\", phonetic approximations of the French pronunciation. History The earliest historical mention of the passepied was by Noël du Fail in 1548, who said it was common at Breton courts. François Rabelais and Thoinot Arbeau, writing later in the 16th century, identify the dance as a type of branle characteristic of Brittany. At this time it was a fast duple-time dance with three-bar phrases, therefore of the branle simple type . Like many folk-dances it was popular at the court of Louis XIV . The passepied was remodelled by Jean-Baptiste Lully as a pastoral concert dance, first appearing in the 1680s as a faster minuet . It is accounted the fastest of the triple-time dances of the time, usually with a time signature of (also occasionally or ), its phrases starting upon the last beat of the measure. Its phrasing had to divide into four measures to accommodate the four characteristic tiny steps over two measures. It used the steps of the minuet, which Lully had long before similarly adapted, to quite different effect, moving lightly and tracing elaborate patterns upon the floor . After this the passepied appeared in a great many theatrical productions, including those of Jean-Philippe Rameau. It is found as late as 1774 in Christoph Willibald Gluck's Iphegenia in Aulis . Writing in 1739 Johann Mattheson described the passepied as a fast dance, with a character approaching frivolity, for which reason it lacks \\"the eagerness, anger, or heat expressed by the gigue\\". Italians often used it as a finale for instrumental sinfonie . Passepieds occasionally appear in suites such as J.S. Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 1, or dramatic music such as his Overture in the French Style for harpsichord. There are often two Passepieds in minor and major keys to be played in the order I, II, I, or else passepieds occur in contrasting pairs, the first reappearing after the second as a da capo . It also appeared as a movement in Henry Purcell's opera, Dioclesian , and hundreds of other Baroque compositions. Revivals Léo Delibes wrote a passepied as part of his incidental music for the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. More modern examples include: *The fourth and final movement of Claude Debussy's Suite bergamasque for piano *The third movement of Igor Stravinsky's Symphony in C, which consists of a minuet, passepied, and fugue *The second number in act 2 of Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Cinderella *The first of five dances in the third movement, \\"Révérences engrenées, premier pentacle\\", of Henri Pousseur's Jardinet avec automates for piano *The third movement of Christopher Rouse's orchestral ballet Friandises *The fourth movement of the Garden of the Senses Suite in part 2 of Michael Gandolfi's The Garden of Cosmic Speculation NotesReferences  * *. * External links *Google Books – \\"Passepied\\" in Little and Jenne's Dance and the Music of J.S.

The exercise started on August 19, 2005, and consisted of combined land, sea, and air elements simulating an intervention in a state besieged by terrorists or political turmoil. It concluded on August 25, 2005. The force practiced air and naval blockades, an amphibious assault, and occupying a region. Approximately 8,000 Chinese troops took part along with 2,000 Russian troops. China initially wanted to hold the exercise near the Taiwan Strait, Russia wanted to hold the exercise in Northwestern China near central Asia, but instead settlement was made on the Shandong Peninsula. There are a number of reasons for the exercise, including: * China is the largest consumer of Russian military technology. The exercise will showcase the Russian weapons including the Tupolev Tu-22M and Tupolev Tu-95 long range bombers. * The two countries are by far the most influential in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the exercise will help to strengthen military ties. * Both countries have stated that the exercise is not directed at any one country, but many believed to be a show of force against the United States and particularly Taiwan. The United States was not invited to observe the exercise, but did observe using satellite reconnaissance. The stated reason for the exercise is counter-terrorism; however, many analysts agree that the use of such heavy firepower, including long-range bombers, is not necessary. It has been recently argued that the exercise was not – as previously assumed – aimed to intimidate Taiwan but instead considered a post-Kim Jong Il regime collapse scenario.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Sandor is the estranged younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, from the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Clash of Kings (1998), A Storm of Swords (2000), and A Feast for Crows (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with Sansa and Arya Stark. Sandor is portrayed by Scottish actor Rory McCann in the HBO television adaptation.  Character description  Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of Gregor Clegane, and was a retainer to House Lannister. He was regarded as one of the most dangerous and skilled fighters in Westeros. His size (in the novels he is 6'8\\", or 2 m and over 300 lbs, or 140 kg) and strength make him an imposing figure, though he is not quite as large as his brother Gregor. His face was distinguished by gruesome burn scars, which he received as a child when his brother pushed his head into a brazier. Consequently, Clegane feared fire and hated his brother. He was also scornful of knight's vows, as his brother was a knight who nonetheless is a sadist who indulged in rape and murder. Clegane was described as a tormented man driven by anger and hate, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his childhood trauma and aspiring only to kill his brother.  Storylines  Novels = Coat of arms of House Clegane Sandor Clegane is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed mainly through the eyes of Sansa and Arya Stark, with some narrations from other characters such as Ned Stark and Tyrion Lannister. A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings In A Game of Thrones, he acts as bodyguard and servant to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon, who calls him \\"Dog\\" but is somewhat attached to him, as Joffrey lacks a father figure from King Robert. While escorting Sansa home, he reveals to her how his face was scarred and expresses much resentment of his brutish older brother and towards the concept of knighthood in general. Clegane hunts down Arya Stark's friend Mycah, and leads the Lannister attack on Eddard Stark's men in the Tower of the Hand during the purge of the Starks. Sandor is named Joffrey's Kingsguard towards the end of A Game of Thrones, but always refuses to become a Knight. Clegane is often assigned to guard Sansa, and becomes protective over her, calling her \\"little bird.\\" He tries to protect her from Joffrey's abuse in A Clash of Kings, and advises her to do whatever Joffrey tells her to do as the best way of staying alive. He even saves Sansa's life when the king is attacked at the streets of King's Landing by his hungry people. Sandor becomes disillusioned during the Battle of the Blackwater and abandons his duty as Joffrey's guard due to the widespread use of wildfire (a fictional incendiary substance inspired by Greek fire) on Tyrion's orders. He secretly goes to see Sansa and offers to escape King's Landing with her, and gets unpredictable when she refuses. He threatens her, but then calms down after she sings him a song about mercy, before fleeing the capital on his own. A Storm of Swords In A Storm of Swords, the lordless Sandor gets drunk and is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, who sentences him to a trial by combat on charge of murder accused by Arya. Sandor prevails against the Brotherhood leader Beric Dondarrion and is set free. He later kidnaps Arya and hopes to ransom her to her brother Robb Stark at Riverrun in order to earn a place in Robb's service. He takes her to the Twins, where Robb is attending the wedding of his uncle. However, just as they arrive, the Red Wedding happens and the Freys begin slaughtering the Starks. Sandor knocks Arya unconscious to prevent her from running into the castle and fights his way out, killing three Frey knights. They later encounter three of Gregor's men — Polliver, Tickler and a pimply squire from House Sarsfield — at the Crossroad Inn. Sandor is provoked while drunken and kills Polliver in the ensuing fight, but gets seriously injured. He becomes critically ill when his wounds begin to fester, so Arya abandons him under a tree to await his apparent death. A Feast for Crows He is mentioned a few times in A Feast for Crows (2005), because stories are spreading that somebody using the Hound's helmet is committing atrocities. But the Elder Brother mentions to Brienne of Tarth that he found Sandor moribund, and is now \\"at rest\\", so his helmet was doubtless stolen from his graveyard. However, the appearance of a mute gravedigger who matches Sandor physically and the Elder Brother's refusal to confirm if Sandor is dead imply that he may still be alive. As for the Hound's helmet, it is after revealed to Brienne and Podrick that it was Rorge and his criminal band who took it. And when the two of them are captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners and Rorge's band is killed, Lem decides to keep the helmet for him, despite Thoros' opposition. =TV adaptation= Scottish actor Rory McCann has received acclaim for his portrayal of Sandor Clegane in the television adaptation of the series of books. Season 1 Clegane is first introduced in the pilot episode when he accompanies the royal court on Robert Baratheon's visit to Winterfell. On the way back to King's Landing, Joffrey falsely accuses a butcher's boy, Mycah, of having attacked him, and Clegane kills the boy, attracting the hatred of Mycah's friend Arya Stark. During the Tourney of the Hand, Sandor's sadistic elder brother Gregor tries to kill Ser Loras Tyrell after Tyrell has unhorsed him, but Sandor defends Loras from Gregor until Robert orders the men to stop fighting. When Ned Stark accuses Joffrey of being a bastard born of incest and orders his arrest, Clegane assists the Lannister soldiers in the subsequent purge of the Stark household and Sansa Stark's capture, although he later comforts Sansa when Joffrey orders her face slapped and advises how to avoid future pain. With Joffrey's ascension to the throne, Clegane is named to the Kingsguard to replace the ousted Ser Barristan Selmy. Season 2 Sandor Clegane continues to defend Sansa, including by covering her after Joffrey orders her stripped in front of the assembled court and rescuing her from being gang- raped during the King's Landing riots. He participates in the Battle of the Blackwater against Stannis Baratheon's forces but is visibly horrified when Tyrion Lannister uses wildfire to incinerate much of Stannis' fleet; he ultimately deserts after witnessing a man burning alive in the battle. Before he leaves King's Landing, he offers to take Sansa north to Winterfell, which she refuses. It is during this season that Sandor Clegane admits to Sansa that he loves killing, saying \\"Killing is the sweetest thing there is\\". Season 3 Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV series Game of Thrones. In the Riverlands, Clegane is arrested by the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of knights and soldiers sent by Eddard Stark to kill Gregor and restore order to the Riverlands. While being transported to their stronghold, he meets other members of the Brotherhood who are traveling with Arya Stark and tells them her true identity. At the Brotherhood's hideout, their leader Lord Beric Dondarrion accuses Clegane of being a murderer; although Clegane asserts that the murders were committed in order to protect Joffrey, Arya testifies that Clegane had killed Mycah despite the boy's not having harmed Joffrey. Lord Beric sentences Clegane to a trial by combat, which Clegane wins to secure his freedom. Although Clegane slays him, Lord Beric is immediately resurrected by the Red Priest Thoros of Myr. Clegane later captures Arya, intending to ransom her to King Robb Stark at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at The Twins. However, as they arrive at the Twins, the Freys turn on and attack the Starks, and Clegane and Arya barely escape the massacre. Season 4 With the rest of House Stark believed dead and the Riverlands now under the rule of House Frey, Clegane decides to ransom Arya to her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. During their journey, Arya reveals to Clegane that she has not forgiven him for killing Mycah and has vowed to kill him. The duo arrive in the Vale to find that Lysa has ostensibly committed suicide. Returning from the Bloody Gate, they encounter the sworn sword to Arya's mother Catelyn, Brienne of Tarth, who had promised to take the Stark children to safety. When Arya refuses to go with Brienne, Brienne and Clegane engage in single combat that culminates in Brienne's knocking Clegane off a cliff, gravely wounding him. Although Clegane begs Arya to kill him, she leaves him to die. Season 6 It is revealed that Clegane survived; he had been discovered by Ray, a warrior turned septon. Clegane assists Ray and his followers in building a sept, but one day, after a brief journey into nearby woods to chop wood, Clegane returns to the community to find everyone slaughtered by rogue members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Clegane takes up an ax to hunt down those responsible and kills four of them before discovering the remaining three about to be hanged by Lord Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who inform him that the group were acting independently of the Brotherhood. Lord Beric allows Clegane to help hang two of the outlaws, followed by an offer to join the Brotherhood in their journey north to fight the White Walkers. Season 7 During their journey north, the Brotherhood stops at a farm owned by a farmer Clegane had previously robbed. Inside, they find the bodies of the farmer and his daughter. Remorseful, Clegane digs them a grave with Thoros's help. Thoros has Clegane look into the flames of the Brotherhood's campfire, and in them the skeptical Clegane sees the White Walkers and their forces marching towards the Wall. The Brotherhood attempts to cross the Wall via Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, but are intercepted by wildling scouts manning the castle and are locked in the ice cells. Soon afterward, Jon Snow, Davos Seaworth, Jorah Mormont, and Gendry arrive at Eastwatch, intending to capture a wight to present to Cersei (now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms) as evidence the White Walkers exist. Clegane, Beric, and Thoros are released to accompany Jon, Jorah, Gendry, and the wilding Tormund Giantsbane beyond the Wall. The group soon captures a wight but is surrounded by the White Walkers and their army of wights, although not before Gendry flees to Eastwatch to request Daenerys Targaryen's aid. Daenerys arrives with her dragons before the group can be overrun. One dragon is killed and reanimated by the Night King, but Daenerys' group, minus Jon - who stays behind to fight back the White Walkers - is able to flee. Clegane joins Jon, Daenerys, and Davos as they sail to King's Landing. At King's Landing, Clegane meets Brienne of Tarth. Despite their previous brutal fight, they converse on civil terms. Clegane learns that Arya is alive and with her family, prompting a rare smile. During the summit in the Dragon Pit outside King's Landing, Clegane confronts his brother and asks what they did to him then cuts off the answer and tells him he always knew who would come for him. Clegane brings out the trunk containing the wight, revealing to Cersei and Jaime Lannister the threat that lies beyond the wall. In the aftermath, Clegane sails to White Harbor with Daenerys' forces with the intention of travelling to Winterfell to aid Jon and Daenerys against the Night King. Season 8 The Hound joins Daenerys, Jon, and their retinues as they march to Winterfell, where he is reunited with Arya and Sansa. The Hound and Arya make peace with one another before the dreaded Battle of Winterfell against the White Walkers. During the battle, the Hound is triggered by the use of fire to destroy the wights and is close to giving up, but is convinced by Beric to keep fighting, indicating towards Arya who is relentlessly fighting beside them. The Hound then travels to King's Landing to kill his brother along with Arya, who intends to kill Cersei. The two infiltrate the Red Keep amongst a crowd of civilians Cersei is using as human shields, but Daenerys begins burning the city down and the Red Keep begins to crumble. The Hound urges Arya to leave as he goes to find his brother. Arya thanks him, calling him by his true name for the first and only time, and bids him farewell. A fight ensues between the Clegane brothers, and Sandor struggles to even injure his inhuman brother. Gregor is momentarily disarmed after the Hound stabs him through the head, and the Hound tackles him off a stairway into the inferno below, resulting in both of their deaths.

It was released on June 22, 1993 through Earache Records in Europe and Giant Records in North America. Covenant was the band's breakthrough album due to their contract with Giant Records and its widespread exposure on MTV's Headbangers Ball, as well as the music video for 'God of Emptiness' appearing on Beavis and Butt-head. It is frequently described as one of the greatest death metal albums of all time, and a landmark album in the genre, influencing countless future metal bands, including Incantation and Dead Congregation. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Covenant was the best selling death metal album as of 2003, with sales of over 150,000 in the United States alone.Puzak, Chris (November 18, 2003). \\"Cannibal Corpse Is Top-Selling Death Metal Band\\". Blog Critics. Retrieved December 20, 2011. In 2017, Rolling Stone named it the 75th best metal album of all time.  Background  In the late 80s, a number of heavy metal and thrash metal bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth enjoyed significant mainstream success, while \\"Iron Maiden went heavy on synths\\" and \\"Testament actually wrote a song called 'The Ballad'\\". In music journalist Michael Nelson's interpretation, there was a growing feeling that \\"the scene was getting co-opted, going soft, cashing in.\\" By the early to mid 90s, thrash metal had largely given way to death metal as it continued to push the limits of extreme metal, while its mainstream acceptability grew partly due to the collaboration between Earache and Columbia Records. Covenant's release through Earache and Giant Records therefore represented one of the most significant releases of that time period, and 1993 is widely credited as one of death metal's highest peaks. Morbid Angel's success with their previous two albums gained them a one-album record deal (with the option of five more) with Giant Records (a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records) in the Spring of 1992. Later that same year, second guitarist Richard Brunelle was kicked out of the band due to alleged substance abuse, meaning that Covenant was recorded as just a trio.  Musical style, writing, composition  The album's lyrics, written by David Vincent, draw heavily on occult, mythological, and Satanic themes, including Theistic Satanism, Sumerian religion and Nietzschean philosophy. Michael Nelson wrote that part of the success of the album is due to the band's success at reflecting these themes musically, particularly due to Trey Azagthoth's guitarwork. Michael Nelson, writing for Stereogum on the album's 20th anniversary, described Azagthoth's work: \\"His guitars seemed to mimic surreal horrors of nature — whirlpools or wildfires — more than they did any musicians of his era. At the time, the most celebrated guitarist in death metal was Chuck Schuldiner of Death, a dazzlingly proficient hyper-shredder with few technical equals. Azagthoth, on the other hand, delivered queasy, nitrous leads that called to mind the most extreme work of free-jazz/grindcore saxophonist John Zorn.\\" An entry on AllMusic explains that \\"Guitarist Trey Azagthoth plays complicated, heavily detuned riffs, some with a lightning-fast picking style and others in a slower groove. Drummer Pete Sandoval is one of the genre's fastest, and his jackhammer style helps complete Morbid Angel's core sound.\\" The album also serves as a rejection of many mainstream musical conventions, and, Nelson of Stereogrum also describes, \\"is never a catchy record. That’s partly because the album is essentially devoid of anything resembling a traditional 'chorus,' but it’s mostly due to the uppermost layers of sound — the things on which the ear and imagination immediately focus. Covenant squeals and reels wildly; the band’s odd and ever-changing time signatures leave little room for grooves.\\"  Recording, production  Covenant was produced by Morbid Angel and Flemming Rasmussen; engineered by Tom Morris and Flemming Rasmussen at Morrisound Recording in Tampa, Florida. It was mixed by Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. Rasmussen was responsible for producing three of Metallica's most famous albums: Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All. In an interview with Metal Hammer, David Vincent explained that they chose him to mix the album because: > “We wanted a different approach and Fleming proved to be a treat to work > with. Besides, he was there from the beginning. He even came in earlier than > scheduled so he could attend few of our rehearsals prior to us entering the > studio. Ultimately, he turned out to be pretty meticulous, especially on how > the drums should sound. Then we did both the vocals and guitars on our own > and Trey and I flew to Copenhagen to mix the whole thing with him.” The track 'Angel of Disease' was originally written in 1985 for 'Abominations of Desolation', but was re-recorded for 'Covenant'. 'Abominations of Desolation' went unreleased until 1991. The first song written for the album was the opening song 'Rapture', which Vincent claims \\"set the tone\\" for the rest of the album. The closing track 'God of Emptiness' was \\"almost like a vision. I had a dream that awoke me up in the middle of the night and I literally then on the spot wrote that song, humming my ideas into a small tape recorder.\\"  Artwork  The album's cover image shows a page from The Book of Ceremonial Magic by Arthur Edward Waite to the right, and a reproduction of \\"The Pact of Urbain Grandier\\" on the left. It is their first album to feature a photograph as the album cover rather than an illustration. It was designed in collaboration with the band and shot by Martin Nesbitt, an Earache employee, and was designed to reflect the album's philosophy. In an interview with Metal Hammer, Vincent claimed that: > “We wanted something that was solemn and sort of like… (he pauses) Not a > rulebook per se but it had to suggest the idea of a pact, an allegiance if > you will. Overall, we wanted something timeless and about commitment. We > felt that this record being what it was, who we were and its subject matter, > it was like our covenant to ourselves and to ourselves. And as a bonus, if > you look closely enough, you’ll find many little details that are references > to a specific lyric of song from that album included in there.”  Release, promotion, marketing  Their record label Giant Records (and its parent company Warner Bros. Records) devoted promotional resources to the album, commissioning two music videos of the tracks 'Rapture' and 'God of Emptiness'. They were both directed by Tony Kunewalder, and David Vincent explained in an interview that \\"Those were the times when labels were still living the high life and they thought nothing of spending too much money on good videos\\". Further, \\"They were connected to each other, although shot six months apart and we had the same director for both of them named Tony Kunewalder. He was a very artistic guy that wasn’t into metal at all but he was a pleasure to work with. The weirdest part is that soon after the God Of Emptiness shooting, he died in a fire on a set of another video soon afterwards so it means that was one of the last thing he ever did.\\" These music videos received heavy rotation on MTV and Headbangers Ball in particular. The video for 'Rapture' premiered on Headbangers Ball and was followed by a video interview with David Vincent. The music video for 'God of Emptiness' was also featured on the television show Beavis and Butt-head. According to Soundscan, the album went on to sell over 150,000 copies in the United States alone. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the album's original release in 1993, the album was remastered in a 'Full Dynamic Range' edition and re-released on CD and vinyl by Earache Records in November 2013.  Touring  Following the commercial success of the album and the significant coverage by MTV in particular, in early 1994 the band toured with Black Sabbath and Motörhead. The tour featured over 20 dates, began on February 8, 1994 at New Britain, Connecticut and Morbid Angel toured in support with Motörhead through to March 13, 1994 at Sunrise, Florida. David Vincent sees Covenant as a vital record for the band in this respect: \\"We got support from MTV and to tour with Black Sabbath and Motörhead in early '94 in places we had never played before while a new wave of aggressive music was coming out. I think that overall, it helped us reach a whole new audience. Without Covenant, we wouldn’t be where we are now and we’re proud that it has stood the test of time like it did.” In 2013 and 2014 the band headlined North American and European tours to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album's original release. Covenant was performed in its entirety on every date of the tour, followed by a selection of songs from the band's other albums.  Reception, legacy and influence  The album is widely considered to be a milestone in the death metal genre, arriving at (and representing) the genre's peak. The album's sales were almost unprecedented \\"for a band, album, and genre so relentlessly extreme.\\" Following the success of Morbid Angel and particularly Covenant, Columbia Records signed many of Earache Records' other bands including Carcass, Entombed, and Napalm Death, seeking to replicate the album's success. However, \\"none of those albums Soundscanned even a third of what Covenant did — worse still, none of them even outsold the previous respective albums by those bands.\\" As a consequence, Columbia systematically dropped these bands from their rosters, cutting ties with all of them within three years. Morbid Angel's following album on Giant Records sold roughly 70,000 copies, but the band were nonetheless also dropped from the label's roster. Further, the lack of new exciting, boundary-pushing death metal bands led to a relative stagnation in the death metal genre. There was also a growing tension within the community, as the \\"inviting mainstream\\" seemed willing to \\"give some Death Metal a try\\", which was in conflict with the \\"essentially anti-mainstream culture that gave birth to and nourished the genre.\\" The growth and development of Norway's black metal scene can be understood as a direct response to the temporary mainstream, commercial success that death metal enjoyed in these few years, \\"a violent negative reaction to death metal that could be traced directly back to Morbid Angel\\". By late 1995, the genre had entered a period of decline. \\"The movement, however, did not die, and more death metal bands continued to deliver their extreme tunes. The scene simply retreated into the underground.\\" In Michael Nelson's view, it was precisely in this retreat that the genre \\"regained its vitality. Today, the genre comfortably coexists (and regularly cross- pollinates) with black metal.\\" In 2017, Rolling Stone named it the 75th best metal album of all time.

It abuts the Villamay and Mason Hill neighborhoods, just south of Alexandria in the South Alexandria section of Fairfax County, Virginia. Designed by Charles M. Goodman and developed by Robert C. Davenport in the 1940s, it was one of the Washington, D.C. area's first post-World-War-II developments. Its roughly 450 houses brought contemporary construction to northern Virginia. Today, the neighborhood is known primarily for its mid-century modern architecture, which remains very cohesive because of a design review committee that advises on building or modification of existing houses. The Hollin Hills Historic District is a 326 acres (132 ha) residential neighborhood encompassing 468 contributing buildings, five contributing sites, and three contributing structures. History Neighborhood entrance sign on Sherwood Hall Lane Davenport intended the name \\"Hollin Hills\\" as a variation of the 18th-century Hollin Hall Plantation, originally owned by George Mason, one of the founding fathers, known as the \\"Father of the Bill of Rights.\\" General Mason named his lands after an English estate of his mother's family. Some of the Hollin Hall plantation buildings still stand on Sherwood Hall Lane. He hired D.C.-based architect Charles M. Goodman (who also designed the Washington National Airport) and landscape architect Dan Kiley to design the community. They chose to design each home with lots no smaller than one-third of an acre. During construction, many trees were retained to block sight lines, and houses were built at angles to ensure privacy. The popularity of the homes, which feature huge expanses of glass, established Goodman as a nationally acclaimed guru of modern architecture. Davenport named some streets to complement the community name, while others were named after family members: Martha's Road for his mother and Rebecca Drive for his daughter. Elba Road was named after one of his prize bulls. Awards Hollin Hills has won many awards, beginning with the Revere Quality House award from the Southwest Research Institute in 1950 and including two 1982 Test of Time awards from the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects, for houses on Stafford Road. Hollin Hills is on the Fairfax County, Virginia, Inventory of Historic Sites. Hollin Hills was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in late June 2013. The Board of the Civic Association of Hollin Hills (CAHH) sought a National Register of Historic Places national historic district designation for the neighborhood, which was granted in September 2013. Notable residents Over the decades, Hollin Hills has attracted artists, architects, politicians, lawyers, doctors and numerous other individuals typical of the metropolitan DC region.

He co-founded the Ishi Press. He has worked with several Japanese professional players. He has a regular go column in The Daily Yomiuri, Japan's largest English-language newspaper. He lives in Chigasaki, Japan. In 2012 Bozulich was a candidate for Comptroller of New York City for the War Veterans Party.  From university  Bozulich was born in Los Angeles, California. He attended UCLA and in 1966 graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in mathematics. Bozulich had worked his way through college by buying and selling highly technical used books and upon graduation decided to become a book publisher.  Ishi press  He moved to Japan and in 1968 in partnership with Stuart Dowsey founded The Ishi Press, a book and magazine publishing company that primarily published books about the game of go. Ishi Press' first few publications were translations of Japanese books such as Eio Sakata's The Middle Game of Go and Modern Joseki and Fuseki Vol. I and II but Bozulich soon began working with Japanese professional players, as well as principal collaborators James Davies and John Power, to produce original works in English. The first of these, Basic techniques of Go by Nagahara and Haruyama, was published in 1969. In 1973, Bozulich began work on a seven-volume set covering all the fundamentals of the game, The Elementary Go Series, with the publication of In the Beginning by Ishigure and Life and Death by Kosugi and Davies. By 1984, the set was complete, when Ishi Press published Nagahara and Bozulich's Handicap Go. Meanwhile, Bozulich continued to translate and publish Japanese material for the nascent Western go-playing community, selecting volumes such as Kageyama's Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and Kage's Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go, and a series of books about basic opening strategies: The Power of the Star-Point (Takagawa), The Chinese Opening: The Sure Win Strategy (Kato) and The 3–3 Point: Modern Opening Theory (Cho). In 1977, the Japan Go Association ceased publication of Go Review, their English-language magazine. Working closely with Power, Bozulich published a quarterly magazine Go World which continued through 129 issues, ceasing publication in 2013. For many years Go World was the major source in English for comprehensive analysis of top Japanese tournament games.  Kiseido  In 1982 Bozulich founded Kiseido Publishing Company, publishing Invincible: The Games of Shusaku. This biography and game collection by John Power is about Honinbo Shusaku, the most famous Japanese player from the 1800s. Kiseido became more active in the 1990s, when Bozulich produced two more multi-volume sets of instructional material: the five volume Mastering the Basics, and the ten volume Get Strong at Go series. Kiseido continues to publish other books as well, such as The Go Player's Almanac, The World of Chinese Go and An Introduction to Modern Fuseki: Korean Style.  Go World  Richard Bozulich has written or published more than one hundred books and magazine and newspaper articles about the game of go. He is the world's most prolific author of go materials in English. Richard Bozulich is the publisher of Go World magazine. He has a regular Go column in The Daily Yomiuri, Japan's largest English-language newspaper. He lives in Chigasaki, Japan and has worked as a professor of mathematics, physics and chemistry at a local college. His father was from Zadar county, Croatia.

Definitely is the fourth studio album by singer Dusty Springfield, recorded and released in the UK in 1968. Production credits go to both John Franz, and for the first time, Springfield herself. The songs on this album were chosen because Springfield \\"liked them\\", as stated in the liner notes. Like the vast majority of her LPs, the album shows a diverse range of styles ranging from soul (\\"Take Another Little Piece of my Heart\\"), pop (\\"This Girl's in Love With You\\"), folk (\\"Morning (Bom Dia)\\") to lounge (\\"Who (Will Take my Place?)\\"). The two sides of the album reflected very different moods: the first side was packed with fast-paced, louder numbers, while the second side was more mellow, which Springfield suggested would be suitable for listening to at night. In 1968, Springfield entered into a contract with Atlantic Records for the United States, which meant that the singer had a different record label for each side of the Atlantic (previously she had been signed to Philips both in the UK and the USA). Springfield's new contract allowed Philips in the UK to release American recordings and Atlantic in the USA to release British recordings. This was the first LP to be covered by this agreement. Atlantic was, however, reluctant to release any British recordings on their label; thus, the album was never released in the States. Tracks from this album were finally released in the USA in 1999 (the year of Springfield's death) on the Rhino Records compilation Dusty in London. In the UK Dusty...

He discovered dinosaur (Albertosaurus sarcophagus) bones in Alberta's Badlands and coal around Drumheller in 1884. Canada's Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta was named in his honour. Tyrrell was born in Weston, Ontario, the third child of William and Elizabeth Tyrrell. He was a student at Weston Grammar School before graduating from Upper Canada College in 1876 and receiving a law degree from the University of Toronto in 1880. After articling for a law firm in Toronto, his doctor advised him to work outdoors due to his health. He joined the Geological Survey of Canada in 1880, leading or participating in numerous explorations. He led the 1893 and 1894 expeditions into the Northern Barren Lands, down the Dubawnt River, the first visit to the Kivalliq Region Barrenlands by a European since the explorations of Samuel Hearne in the 1770s. His younger brother, James Williams Tyrrell, accompanied Tyrrell on the expedition, which included the first European contact with the Ihalmiut, an Inuit people from the interior of what is today Nunavut. Tyrrell married Mary Edith Carey in 1894 and they had three children, Mary (1896), George (1900), and Thomas (1906). Mary Edith was founder and first president in 1921 of the Women's Association of the Mining Industry of Canada. In 1894, Tyrrell stumbled upon biographical recollections (11 books of field notes, 39 journals, maps and a narrative) of Canadian overland explorer, cartographer and fur trader David Thompson and, in 1916, published them as David Thompson's Narrative. Tyrrell went into the gold-mining business in 1898, a career that would last more than 50 years. He was mine manager of the Kirkland Lake Gold Mine in northern Ontario for many years starting in 1926. Tyrrell retired to northeast Scarborough on the Rouge River, where he established substantial apple orchards and interest in grafting and breeding. The expanded orchards, later managed by his son George, are now the site of the Toronto Zoo. He died in Toronto in 1957 at the age of 98.

The concept of the screenplay by Ted Griffin is that a woman learns that her mother and grandmother may be the inspiration for the 1963 novel The Graduate by Charles Webb. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment grossing $88.9 million against its $70 million budget. Plot In 1997, Sarah Huttinger, an obituary and wedding announcement writer for The New York Times, travels to Pasadena, California, for her sister Annie's wedding, accompanied by her fiancé Jeff Daly. When Sarah tells her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu, that she is unsure about getting married, Katharine lets slip that her late daughter, Sarah's mother Jocelyn, ran off to Cabo San Lucas a week before her own wedding. Sarah visits her mother's best friend, Aunt Mitzy, who confirms that Jocelyn spent time with their prep school classmate Beau Burroughs the week before her wedding to Sarah's father Earl, and that Beau was friends with Charles Webb, the author of the novel The Graduate. Jeff points out Sarah's parents were married just short of nine months before her birth, leading her to wonder if Beau might really be her biological father. Sarah also accuses her grandmother of being the inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, the older character who seduced the young man (in The Graduate), who later ran away with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. After the wedding, Sarah decides to fly to San Francisco, where Beau, now a highly successful and very wealthy Silicon Valley Internet wizard, is giving a speech. She meets him; and he admits to sleeping with her mother and grandmother, but assures Sarah he couldn't be her father because he is sterile after suffering blunt testicular trauma while playing a soccer game in high school. The two go out for drinks, and the following morning Sarah wakes up in Beau's bed in his Half Moon Bay homethe third generation in her family to have sex with Beau. Although guilt-stricken by her behavior, Sarah allows Beau to convince her to be his date at a charity ball, where she meets Beau's son Blake. Beau explains his wife wanted a biological child and was artificially inseminated to become pregnant. Mollified, Sarah kisses Beau and is caught by Jeff, who has returned to California to find her after not hearing from her since she met Beau. An argument ensues and Jeff leaves her. Dejected, Sarah returns to visit Katharine, who flies into a rage when she learns Beau has slept with her granddaughter. The two learn Annie suffered an anxiety attack while flying to her honeymoon and wants to talk to Sarah. Sarah tells her sister about the sexual relationship three generations of Richelieu/Huttinger women have had with Beau. She reassures Annie she truly is in love with her husband, Scott, and in doing so, realizes she's ready to marry Jeff. It is also revealed that Earl was the one who accidentally caused Beau's testicular trauma. This makes Beau somewhat nervous to be around Earl, though Katherine is quite pleased by the revelation. Earl reveals to Sarah he always knew about Jocelyn and Beau's affair. Jocelyn returned to Earl because she loved him and he was someone with whom she could build a life. On the night she returned, Sarah was conceived. This explained the slightly early timing between her parents' wedding and her own birth. Determined to win Jeff back, Sarah returns to New York City and tells her fiancé about her feelings. They reconcile on the condition that if they ever have a daughter, she would not be allowed anywhere near Beau. The film ends with Sarah and Jeff's wedding. Cast In addition, Kathy Bates appears, uncredited, in the role of Aunt Mitsy, while George Hamilton has a brief uncredited non-speaking cameo as himself. Production Screenwriter Ted Griffin was the original director, but problems arose soon after principal photography began on July 21, 2004. The production fell several days behind schedule in the first week, and on August 5, Griffin fired cinematographer Ed Lachman from the project. Griffin was let go by executive producer Steven Soderbergh the following day, and the production shut down in order to allow replacement Rob Reiner to make script, cast, and crew changes before resuming filming on August 18. Original cast members Charlie Hunnam, Lesley Ann Warren, Tony Bill, and Greta Scacchi were replaced by Reiner.Anne Thompson. \\"A Film Studio Fires a Director, Raising Eyebrows in Hollywood\\".

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 19% rating based on reviews from 113 critics, with the consensus: \\"This riff on The Graduate has a solid cast, but is too lightweight to fully register.\\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 35 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \\"I suppose Rumor Has It could be worse, though at the moment I'm at a loss to say just how. Ms. MacLaine and Mr. Costner are seasoned professionals, giving lackluster laugh lines more juice than they deserve, and Jennifer Aniston is as plucky and engaging as ever ... [but her] efforts are wasted in a movie that can't even seem to sustain interest in itself.\\"A. O. Scott. \\"A Romantic Entanglement With a Heart of Celluloid\\" The New York Times, December 23, 2005. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"The plot ... sounds like a gimmick. That's because it is a gimmick. But it's a good gimmick. And Rumor Has It works for good reasons, including sound construction and the presence of Kevin Costner ... a natural actor with enormous appeal ... This is not a great movie, but it's very watchable and has some good laughs. The casting of Aniston is crucial, because she's the heroine of this story, and ... has the presence to pull it off.\\"Roger Ebert. \\"Rumor Has It\\". Chicago Sun-Times, December 23, 2005. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"The movie has that fatal triptych that is becoming Reiner's romantic-comedy signature: drippy sentiment, zany scenes that trivialize the characters and a horror of adventure ... needless to say, Rumor Has It fails as a successor to The Graduate. It fails artistically but also philosophically, in that it rebuts the spirit of the earlier film, while offering nothing attractive in its place.\\"Mick LaSalle. \\"Passion gets a bad rap and Aniston's ditzy act gets old in Rob Reiner's play-it-safe homily 'Rumor Has It'\\". San Francisco Chronicle, December 24, 2005. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded it one out of four stars, calling it a \\"comic turd\\" and adding, \\"The creepy script, by T.M. Griffin, is directed by Rob Reiner in a sleepwalking daze that Costner emulates by rotely repeating his performance in The Upside of Anger and in the process squeezing all the juice.\\"Peter Travers. \\"Rumor Has It...\\". Rolling Stone, January 6, 2006. Brian Lowry of Variety said, \\"As muddled in most respects as its title, Rumor Has It... begins with an intriguing premise ... but it devolves into a bland romance spiced with too little comedy ... There's a germ of an idea here, but Reiner and Griffin race through the plot beats so rapidly that poor Sarah seldom has time to breathe, which also describes the movie ... [Aniston] never settles down enough to offer more than a shrill whine and pained expression.\\"Brian Lowry. \\"Rumor Has It...\\". Variety, December 19, 2005. =Box office= The film opened at number 10 at the U.S. box office, on 2,815 screens on Christmas 2005, and earned $3,473,155 on that first day.

Its founders, led by playwright and director Rachel Crothers, included the actress and playwright Louise Closser Hale and actresses Dorothy Donnelly, Josephine Hull, Minnie Dupree, Elizabeth Tyree and Louise Drew. The organization established workrooms for sewing uniforms and other garments (with total output totaling 1,863,645 articles), set up clothing and food collection centers, sold Liberty Bonds, and opened a canteen on Broadway for servicemen. It also presented benefit performances to raise money, including some held in a temporary \\"Liberty Theater\\" built outside the New York Public Library. In total, the group raised nearly $7,000,000 for the war effort. = The American Theatre Wing of the Allied War Relief = Servicemen enjoying a performance at the New York City Stage Door Canteen in 1942. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Crothers reestablished the Stage Women's War Relief as a branch of the British War Relief Society. The revived organization's members included Mary Antoinette \\"Toni\\" Perry, Helen Hayes, Lynn Fontaine, and Tallulah Bankhead. They began fundraising and organizing clothing donations for European refugees. In 1941, with the entry of the United States into the war, the organization was renamed The American Theatre Wing of the Allied War Relief and shifted its focus to the American war effort.  Stage Door Canteen  Under the leadership of Perry and Crothers, the Wing opened the Stage Door Canteen to entertain American servicemen in New York. The first canteen was in the basement of the 44th Street Theatre, and similar entertainment and dining venues were established in Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Cleveland, Newark, and San Francisco, as well as abroad in London and Paris. In the US canteens, servicewomen were denied entry, although this was not the case in the European locations. Lauren Bacall worked as a hostess in the New York Stage Door Canteen, and later recalled seeing Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontaine washing dishes and serving coffee there. The Andrews Sisters were frequent performers. The Stage Door Canteen made its way into national popular culture with a 1942 weekly radio show and a 1943 movie called Stage Door Canteen. = The American Theatre Wing: post–World War II – present = After World War II, the Wing founded The Community Players to assist war veterans and their families on their return home. Co-chair of the Community Players was Katharine Cornell, who was active in the Stage Door Canteen. With the close of the war, the Wing concentrated on holding seminars about American theater, and on funding numerous scholarship grants. It sponsored the First American Congress of Theatre (FACT) in 1947, but it is best known in contemporary times for having created, in the same year, The American Theatre Wing's Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre, or Tony Awards for short, which it still sponsors and which awards were themselves named for Perry, its co-founder and wartime chair, who had died in 1946. The initial presentation of the Wing's Tony Awards program on radio and television was broadcast only locally in New York City. In 1967, it partnered with the League of American Theatres and Producers, now called The Broadway League, to present them on nationwide network television. From 1965 to 1998,Isabelle Stevenson was the President of the ATW. After retiring, she served as chairwoman of the board of directors until her death in 2003.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1999. The episode features the introduction of Joe Swanson, who would become a main character in the series. Peter Griffin must find a replacement player for an upcoming softball game. Peter eventually convinces Joe to play for the team after learning that he played baseball in college. When Joe shows up the following morning, Peter realizes that Joe is in a wheelchair. Joe turns out to be a great player, and the team wins the game. Peter becomes jealous of Joe and tries to become a hero. In a subplot, Meg Griffin tries to get Joe's son Kevin to notice her. \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\" was directed by Monte Young and written by the writing team of Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman. It featured guest performances from actress Suzie Plakson, figure skater Michelle Kwan, as well as actors Wally Wingert and Carlos Alazraqui. Much of the episode features a cutaway style of humor that is typically used in Family Guy, many of which feature cultural references and include Super Friends, Pez, Teletubbies, and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. The episode received positive praise from television critics, who considered it to be a memorable introduction for the character of Joe Swanson; certain critics praised the fight sequence between Joe and The Grinch, while others criticized the episode's cutaway gags as well as its plot twists, which they regarded as \\"odd\\" and \\"counter- intuitive\\". Plot summary At the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory, safety inspector Peter Griffin is working when his boss Mr. Weed introduces Guillermo, a ringer who will attempt to assist the company in winning the annual softball game. At home, Peter's wife Lois informs him of their new neighbors, the Swanson family, and wishes for him to make friends with them; however, Peter is not interested and leaves with Brian for softball practice. The regular pitcher is absent, so Peter fills in. He injures Guillermo with a wild pitch during practice and must find a new player to replace him or else he will be fired. Meanwhile, Lois goes with her youngest son, Stewie, to meet the new neighbors. She is greeted by Bonnie Swanson and soon after meets her husband, Joe, while Meg falls in love with Joe and Bonnie's son, Kevin. When Peter comes home he is rude to the Swansons. Later that night, Peter thinks about who can replace Guillermo, and Lois, hearing her husband's dilemma, reveals that Bonnie told her that Joe played baseball in college. Hearing this, Peter goes to Joe and apologizes for his earlier behavior towards him, and convinces him to play on his company softball team. However, while Peter and Mr. Weed are waiting for Joe at the ballpark, they're horrified when Joe shows up in a wheelchair, as Peter did not notice that Joe is paraplegic. Despite this, Joe proves to be an excellent ballplayer and leads Peter's company's team to victory. That night, Joe has a celebratory party in his house, where he reveals that he is a police officer who was crippled after fighting The Grinch on the roof of an orphanage (this was later revealed to be a cover-up in the 2012 episode \\"Joe's Revenge\\") and soon becomes very popular with the neighbors, including Peter's family. Joe's popularity makes Peter jealous, so Peter wants to be a hero too. He attempts to stop a bank robbery to compete with Joe's heroism. Peter and Brian are taken hostage in the process, but Joe convinces the robbers to surrender. An applauding crowd hoists Joe away in praise, leaving his wheel chair empty. Stewie tries to unlock the \\"power of the wheelchair,\\" but Lois manages to remove him and puts a pacifier in his mouth, so he quickly falls asleep. After the hostage situation, Peter is disappointed, but his family consoles him by telling him that he is their hero.Callaghan, p. 30Plot synopsis information for \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\", in Family Guy: Volume 1. [DVD]. 2003-04-15. 20th Century Fox. Production Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman wrote \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\". \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\" was written by Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman, the first time writing for the series for both, and directed by Monte Young, also his first Family Guy episode. During the production of the episode, the writers shared one office lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew.MacFarlane, Seth. (2003-04-15). Commentary for \\"Death Has a Shadow\\", in Family Guy: Volume 1. [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. MacFarlane compared the production of the first season to a college project; the only difference was that he was being funded this time. The guest cast for the episode featured actress Suzie Plakson, figure skater Michelle Kwan, as well as actors Wally Wingert and Carlos Alazraqui. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman. \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\" serves as the introduction of police lieutenant and neighbor of the Griffin family Joe Swanson (voiced by Patrick Warburton), as well as his family consisting of his wife Bonnie (Jennifer Tilly) and their son Kevin. During the production of the episode they developed a way to hide the fact that Joe used a wheelchair. This was done by showing the character Joe from the waist up during part of the episode. \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\" is notable as it is the first episode of Family Guy not to feature words in its title pertaining to \\"Death\\" or \\"Murder\\". This convention was originally started due to creator Seth MacFarlane being a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense; however, this convention was dropped after individual episodes became hard to identify and the novelty wore off.Callaghan, p. 32 The story of how Joe was crippled is retconned in the episode \\"Joe's Revenge\\". In the episode, Joe reveals that he was actually paralyzed by a drug dealer, whom he was investigating, after accidentally giving himself away. Cultural references Dr. Seuss' children's story How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was referenced. The Super Friends make an appearance in the episode when Peter references a time when he played strip poker in the Hall of Justice. After Wonder Woman loses and takes off her clothes, Robin simply stares at Peter instead of a naked Wonder Woman. The episode also makes a historical reference when a boy is showing his friend a Pez dispenser that looks like John F. Kennedy's head. The dispenser is then destroyed by a policeman's bullet. The boy says, \\"Oh well, at least I still have my Bobby Kennedy Pez dispenser\\". This is a reference to the assassinations of both John and Robert Kennedy. Reception \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\" received favorable reviews from television critics. In a 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode, rating it a 7.9/10 and calling it \\"a great introduction for Joe\\". He noted that the fight sequence between Joe and the Grinch \\"paved the road for many action sequences to come\\". He also praised the strong emphasis on storyline. He deemed some of the gags \\"classic\\" including the gag featuring the Super Friends. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic wrote a more mixed review, rating the episode a 55 out of 100; Pierson found the plot odd, stating that its twists were counter intuitive, causing them to be less funny and not stand out. He also felt the cutaway jokes were short and average. He commented positively on some of the jokes, and the inclusion of Peter's new neighbors saying they provided a new dynamic to the series.

Egri (June 4, 1888 – February 7, 1967) was the author of The Art of Dramatic Writing, which is widely regarded as one of the best works on the subject of playwriting, though its teachings have since been adapted for the writing of short stories, novels, and screenplays.Tibor Szy.

New York 1963 p 95 He is also the author of the companion textbook, The Art of Creative Writing, which further expounds on similar subjects. Early years Born into a Jewish family,Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Walter Dean Myers: A Literary Companion, McFarland (2015), p. 13 Egri came to the US in 1906 and worked in a New York garment factory as a tailor and presser. He was an active member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union.A tailor turns author. New York Times. April 17, 1927. Playwright Egri wrote his first three-act play at the age of ten, according to his biographical sketch in The Art of Dramatic Writing. In 1927, Rapid Transit, Egri's expressionist play, was translated from Hungarian and produced at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York. Casting about for some adequate means of conveying a sense of the furious pace of this machine age, Egri pictured a world in which all of life is compressed into twenty-four hours. Children grow to maturity in a few minutes; meals are eaten in split seconds; tabloid newspapers are issued at intervals of a second or two, and the loss of half a minute is a serious matter. The New York Times described the play as \\"chaotic at times, but sporadically interesting.\\" Rapid Transit depicts swift moving world. New York Times. April 8, 1927 Egri was also author of other plays, among them the satirical comedy Believe Me or Not (1933), Tornado (1938), This is Love (1945 with Arden Young) and The Cactus Club (1957). His one-act Hungarian plays include Satan is Dead, Spiders, Between Two Gods, There Will be No Performance, and Devils. Teacher of playwriting Egri taught courses in playwriting, first in New York (1860 Broadway and 2 Columbus Circle), and then in Los Angeles. One student who garnered much attention was a 63-year-old grandmother, Esther Kaufman, who attended Egri's classes. Egri encouraged Kaufman to write a play about growing up on the Lower East Side. The result was A Worm in the Horseradish, which had its premiere at the Maidman Playhouse in New York, March 13, 1961, and closed May 28 after mixed reviews.Lewis Funke. A GRANDMOTHER ENTERS THEATRE. At 63, She is About to Have First Play Produced About Life on Lower East Side. New York Times. February 14, 1961 Egri also worked with other playwrights and screenwriters, including Woody Allen, who took Egri's course at 2 Columbus Circle. \\"I still think his The Art of Dramatic Writing is the most stimulating and best book on the subject ever written, and I have them all,\\" Allen told biographer Eric Lax.Woody Allen: a biography By Eric Lax. Da Capo Press; New edition (December 26, 2000) p 74 The Art of Dramatic Writing Originally published by Simon & Schuster in 1942 as How to Write a Play, Egri's treatise was revised and published as The Art of Dramatic Writing in 1946. Egri argues in The Art of Dramatic Writing against Aristotle's view of character being secondary to plot (as stated in Aristotle's Poetics). According to Egri, well defined characters will drive the plot themselves, and so the foundation of character is the essential germination of a well crafted story. Central to Egri's argument is his claim that the best stories follow the logical method of thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or dialectic, to prove what he calls a \\"premise.\\" A premise, as Egri describes it, is a thematic truth. In The Art of Dramatic Writing he offers as an example the premise that \\"stinginess leads to ruin.\\" Having settled on this theme, Egri writes, the playwright can detect in the statement the suggestion of a story's beginning, middle, and end: first, the establishment of an obsessively stingy character; next, the collision of that character's stinginess with inevitable opposition, or antithesis; and finally the character's ruin. Egri also emphasizes what he sees as the ever-present role of change in all forms of life, forcing people to evolve and synthesize new philosophies in the face of one overwhelming obstacle after another.Lajos Egri, The Art of Dramatic Writing, Simon & Schuster, 2004. The Art of Creative Writing In 1965, Egri expanded on his views of character development and motivation in the book, The Art of Creative Writing. His theses in this work can be summarized as follows: # All human beings are fundamentally selfish, their primary drive being to feel, or be perceived as, important. # Human character is fixed and does not change significantly over life. # Creative writing should start from identification of one or more main characters, rather than from actions, events or incidents. # Characters should have an overriding trait (Egri’s word is ‘compulsion’), typically negative, such as greed, snobbery or extravagance, coupled with the determination that that trait should prevail. # The author should clearly understand her characters’ motivations, if necessary by providing histories/biographies which inform the story even if they do not form part of it. # A satisfying structure - used in many of the book's examples - is one in which two characters with opposing flaws are inextricably bound together, leading to a crisis in which the conflict is resolved by some dramatic action. Later life Egri taught creative writing in his West Los Angeles home (at 11635 Mayfield Avenue) until shortly before his death. He died of a heart attack at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital.Lajos Egri, 79 (sic). Writing teacher.

He shot down 29 enemy airplanes and 7 balloons; two other Victories went unconfirmed.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/buckler.php He was one of only four German fighter aces to win Germany's highest decorations for valor for both enlisted man and officer. Early life and service Buckler's father was a roofer, and Buckler followed him into the family trade. At 15 years of age, Buckler had an interest in architecture and worked for Anthony Fokker but left in October, 1912 to join the Infantry Life Regiment 117. After suffering a bad wound on the Western Front in September, 1914, he applied for a transfer to the German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkräfte) the following month while on recuperation leave. He trained in FEA 6 (Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 6), and by the summer of 1915 was flying artillery direction missions over Verdun as an Observer in FA(A) 209 before training as a pilot. In November 1916 he transferred to Jasta 17 as a founding member. Just after he joined Jagdstaffel 17, they re-equipped with the Albatros D.II. Aerial victories and wounds He scored his initial victory on 17 December 1916, making numerous passes at a French Caudron over Bras before shooting it down. On 17 July he scored victory number 11 although he was wounded again and did not score again until 9 August. On 11 August he downed a British RE 8, and was wounded yet again the next day. Victory 14 was on 29 September, possibly because the wound kept him out of action. On 18 November he was commissioned as a Leutnant. He was wounded for the fourth time on 30 November 1917, wounded in both his arms and chest. His subsequent crash then completely broke both arms. He lay under his smashed aircraft for hours before counter-attacking German infantry overran the wreckage and rescued him. On 4 December 1917, while he was recovering from his wounds, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite. The injuries kept him out of action for months and he would not score again until 16 April 1918. After recovering, he rejoined Jasta 17. At this time had two airplanes dedicated for his personal use.'Above The Lines', Franks, Guest & Bailey, 1993 (Grub street) page 87 He dubbed them Mops and Lilly. He flew \\"Mops\\" and \\"Lilly\\" to score 3 more victories before he was severely wounded yet again on 6 May 1918, this time in the left ankle. His next victory came 5 months later on 5 October. He scored twice more in the final days of the war, and had his second unconfirmed triumph on 8 November. Postwar In 1939, Buckler wrote his memoirs, entitled \\"Malaula!

The film follows Tomas Ericsson (Björnstrand), pastor of a small rural Swedish church, as he deals with an existential crisis and his Christianity. The film is the second in a series of thematically related films, following Through a Glass Darkly (1961) and followed by The Silence (1963), which is sometimes considered a trilogy. In it, Bergman reconsidered Through a Glass Darklys argument that God is love, and repeated the prior film's reference to God as a monstrous spider. Bergman formed the story after speaking to a clergyman whose parishioner committed suicide. It was shot in different locations in Sweden in 1962. Vilgot Sjöman's film Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie was made simultaneously with Winter Light and documents its production. The feature received positive reviews for its cinematography and themes. Plot In the final moments of Pastor Tomas Ericsson's noon service, only a handful of people are in attendance, including fisherman Jonas Persson and his pregnant wife Karin, and Tomas's ex-mistress, the atheistic Märta. After the service, Tomas, though coming down with a cold, prepares for his three o'clock service in another town. Before he leaves, however, the Perssons arrive to speak to him. Jonas has become morose after hearing that China is developing an atomic bomb. Tomas speaks to the man briefly, but asks Jonas to return after taking his wife home. No sooner have the Perssons left than substitute teacher Märta enters, and she attempts to comfort the miserable Tomas, and asks if he's read the letter she wrote to him. He has not, and tells her of his failure to help Jonas, and wonders if he will have anything to say, since he is without hope as well. Märta states her love for Tomas, but also her belief that he does not love her. She leaves, and Tomas reads her letter. In the letter, Märta describes Tomas's neglect of her, relating a story of how a rash that disfigured her body repulsed him, and neither his faith nor his prayers did anything to help her. She writes of how her family was warm and loving without religion, and expresses bewilderment at his indifference to Jesus. Tomas finishes the letter, and falls asleep. Awakened by the return of Jonas, Tomas clumsily tries to provide counsel, before finally admitting that he has no faith as well. He says his faith was an egotistical one – God loved humanity, but Tomas most of all. Serving in Lisbon during the Spanish Civil War, Tomas could not reconcile his loving God with the atrocities being committed, so he ignored them. Tomas finally tells Jonas that things make more sense if we deny the existence of God, because then man's cruelty needs no explanation. Jonas leaves, and Tomas faces the crucifix and declares himself finally free. Märta, who has been lurking in the chapel, is overjoyed to hear this, and embraces Tomas, who again does not respond to her affections. They are interrupted by the widow Magdalena, who tells them that Jonas has just committed suicide with a rifle. Tomas drives, alone, to the scene, and stoically helps the police cover Jonas's body with a tarp. Märta arrives on foot, and she and Tomas drive off to her home, where she invites him in to take some medicine for his cold. Waiting in Märta's classroom attached to her house, Tomas finally lashes out at her, telling her first that he rejected her because he was tired of the gossip about them. When that fails to deter her affections, Tomas then tells her that he was tired of her problems, her attempts to care for him, and her constant talking, and that Märta could never measure up to his late wife, the only woman he has ever loved. Though shocked by the attack, Märta agrees to drive with him to the Persson house. Informed of Jonas's suicide, Karin collapses onto the stairs and wonders how she and her children will go on. Tomas makes a perfunctory offer of help, and leaves. Arriving for the three o'clock service at the second church, Tomas and Märta find the building empty except for Algot, the handicapped sexton, and Fredrik, the organist. In the vestry, Algot questions Tomas about the Passion. Algot wonders why so much emphasis was placed on the physical suffering of Jesus, which was brief in comparison to the many betrayals he faced from his disciples, who denied his messages and commands, and finally from God, who did not answer him on the cross. He asks, \\"Wasn't God's silence worse?\\" Tomas, who has been listening silently, answers yes. Meanwhile, Fredrik tells Märta that she should leave the small town and Tomas and live her life, rather than stay and have her dreams crushed like the rest of them, but she chooses to start praying. Fredrik and Algot wonder if they should have a service since no one has shown up. Tomas still chooses to hold it, and the bells are rung. He begins the service reciting the Sanctus: \\"Holy Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty; heaven and earth are full of your glory.\\" Cast * Gunnar Björnstrand – Tomas Ericsson, pastor * Ingrid Thulin – Märta Lundberg, schoolteacher * Gunnel Lindblom – Karin Persson * Max von Sydow – Jonas Persson * Allan Edwall – Algot Frövik, sexton * Kolbjörn Knudsen – Knut Aronsson, warden * Olof Thunberg – Fredrik Blom, organist * Elsa Ebbesen – Magdalena Ledfors, widow Themes Ingmar Bergman identified previous films he had made with similar themes as The Virgin Spring (1960) and Through a Glass Darkly (1961). Winter Light is often considered the second film in a trilogy, following Through a Glass Darkly and completed by The Silence. All three films focus on spiritual issues. Bergman writes, \\"These three films deal with reduction. Through a Glass Darkly – conquered certainty. Winter Light – penetrated certainty. The Silence – God's silence – the negative imprint. Therefore, they constitute a trilogy\\". He later retracted his claim the films form a trilogy. With Through a Glass Darkly ending with a discussion of how God is love, Winter Light further examines if understanding God is as simple as that. Bergman stated he abandoned the idea that love is proof of God because it was unsatisfactory to explain to a character who was suicidal over fear of nuclear war. The character Blom mocks the idea of God as love, attributing the words to Tomas but quoting the end of Through a Glass Darkly exactly. Tomas's loss of his wife, and his loss of his ability to love, is further proof to him that God has become silent. In contrast, the character Algot, presented as enlightened, equates Tomas's spiritual crisis with sayings of Jesus on the cross and God's \\"silence\\". Like Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light describes God as a \\"spider-god\\", with Winter Light explaining the metaphor when Tomas relates the spider-god to suffering, as opposed to his previous ideas of a God of love that provides comfort. The ending may mean Tomas has decided God does not exist, or that Tomas learns he must keep his faith because all Christians, including Jesus, grapple with God's silence. In Bergman's view, Winter Light represents the end of his study on whether God exists, after which human love became his main concern. ProductionDevelopment= Director and screenwriter Ingmar Bergman was inspired to make the film after talking to a clergyman, who related how he had offered spiritual advice to a fisherman who later killed himself. To this, Bergman added the ideas of the clergyman struggling with his faith and a relationship outside marriage. The idea of the character becoming depressed over fear of China and weapons of mass destruction was based on an article Bergman himself had read, and he acknowledged it reflected his own dread. Bergman attempted to structure the screenplay as chamber music, in three acts. It is meant, in part, as criticism of the governance of the Church of Sweden, which Bergman felt was condemning itself by failing to keep what is important. He completed the screenplay on 11 August 1961, at which point Vilgot Sjöman began filming the documentary Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie chronicling the production. With this film, Bergman took the rare step of sharing the screenplay with his father, Church of Sweden minister Erik Bergman, and boasted that his father read it three times. Ingmar may have been trying to communicate to his father that he understood Erik, but the name of the character, Ericsson (son of Erik), may indicate the character represents Ingmar more than Erik. =Casting= Ingmar Bergman personally cast some of the roles himself. Actor Gunnar Björnstrand, who played Tomas, typically acted in more comedic roles, and found it challenging to play a character who was in some ways unlikable. This led him to forget some of his lines, which Bergman said he had never seen Björnstrand do before. However, Björnstrand told Sjöman he personally liked the character because of his relatability. Allan Edwall played Algot, a character with the same form of rheumatism as prop artist K.A. Bergman. As a result, K.A. Bergman supervised Edwall's performance. =Filming= Skattunge kyrka was a filming location. The film was shot between 4 October 1961 and 17 January 1962 in the Filmstaden studios, Skattunge kyrka and Rättvik. The crew was unable to shoot inside the real Skattunge kyrka church, so they built a set for interiors. Although most film sets have no roofs, the crew built a roof over the church set it constructed. K.A. Bergman brought in hymn boards, which were centuries old, from real churches in Forsbacka and Lillkyrka. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist spent one month studying lighting in the church at different times of day and in different conditions, conducting photography tests. Nykvist's lighting was used directly from low perspectives in his shots. To reduce the shadows as much as possible, Nykist had reflectors and screens built to also indirectly light scenes. Although the clothing is ordinary, costume designer Max Goldstein had the actors try out many articles of clothing to determine what looked best, and Ingmar Bergman did not review his sketches. The film employs no score aside from the organ music. Bergman planned to use Sarabande from Suite No. 2 in D minor for Cello, BWV 1008 by Johann Sebastian Bach for the scene where Tomas and Märta leave the scene of Jonas's suicide, tying in with the use of the piece in Through a Glass Darkly, but Bergman eventually abandoned the idea as \\"contrived\\". Bergman judged the speed of filming to be slower than his average film, because of struggles to master the right emotions, though scenes did not require an unusually high number of takes. The scene where Märta first comforts Tomas took 11 takes. Release The film opened in Sweden on 11 February 1963. Vilgot Sjöman's interviews with audience members at the Swedish premiere indicated viewers thought it was a masterpiece, that the performances were realistic, and Bergman's struggles with faith were relevant to everyone. In the United States, Winter Light opened in New York City on 13 May 1963, distributed by Janus Films. On 19 August 2003, The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in Region 1, in a boxset with Through a Glass Darkly, The Silence and Sjöman's documentary Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie. In 2018, Criterion announced a Blu-ray release in Region A for 20 November 2018, along with 38 other Bergman films, in the set Ingmar Bergman's Cinema. Reception Winter Light drew ambivalent responses in the American press. In Variety, it was billed as \\"an extremely moving and fascinating film for the religiously aware, and a somewhat boring one for the religiously indifferent\\". Judith Crist of the New York Herald Tribune wrote that the work \\"casts a gloom-tinged glare upon the human condition with chilling clarity\\", but found the film \\"bleak and cold in its abstract ideas\\". John Simon described it as \\"inferior Bergman\\" in The New Leader, but wrote that it still \\"deserves to be seen\\". In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called it \\"a thoughtful, engrossing, shocking film\\". The National Board of Review named it one of the Top Foreign Films in its 1963 Awards. In 2007, Roger Ebert added Winter Light to his Great Movies list, citing the film's \\"bleak, courageous power\\" and praising its visual style as \\"one of rigorous simplicity\\". In his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars, calling it a \\"Powerful, penetrating drama\\". Bergman cited Winter Light as his favorite among his films. The film has an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 9, 1999. The episode follows Chris as he is ejected from the Youth Scouts, and Peter drives the family to Scout headquarters to get him readmitted. During a rest stop at a Native American casino, Lois gambles away the family car. Peter pretends to be a member of the tribe in an attempt to get it back, and is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage, giving him and Chris an opportunity to bond. \\"The Son Also Draws\\" was written by Ricky Blitt and directed by Neil Affleck, both working on their first Family Guy episode. The episode guest starred actors Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman and actor Patrick Bristow. Much of the episode's humor is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including references to Speed Racer, Happy Days, Nova, One Day at a Time, and The More You Know. Critical reception for the episode was favorable; certain critics believed the episode was not an \\"instant classic\\" in contrast to the other episodes of the season but called it \\"memorable\\" and \\"brilliant\\" nevertheless, while others regarded it as the black sheep of the season. The episode caused controversy in Canada for the episode's final gag, in which Peter states that \\"Canada sucks.\\" Ricky Blitt, the episode's writer, is himself Canadian. Plot Chris hates being in the Youth Scouts and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father Peter. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the troop leader during a Soap Box Derby. Peter insists on driving Chris and the rest of the family (Peter's wife Lois, their daughter Meg and their infant Stewie) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he can turn the TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes. The family stops at a Native American casino as Peter needs to use the bathroom, Lois quickly becomes addicted to gambling and loses the family car. After hearing that Lois has gambled the car away, Peter tries to get it back by claiming to be Native American. The doubtful Indian elders demand that he go on a vision quest to prove his heritage. Chris accompanies Peter into the wilderness, hoping to tell him that he only wants to draw instead of being in the Scouts. Delirious from hunger, Peter begins talking to anthropomorphic trees and sees a vision of his spiritual guide, Fonzie. After hearing Fonzie's advice Peter finally listens to Chris's complaints and realizes his son is a talented artist. Peter and Chris return to the casino and reclaim the car. The episode ends with Lois, Stewie, and Meg counteracting stereotypes about Native Americans, Mexicans, and Swedes, respectively, before Peter comments that \\"Canada sucks.\\" Production Alex Borstein helped in the writing of the episode. \\"The Son Also Draws\\" was written by Ricky Blitt, his first episode in the Family Guy series, and directed by former Simpsons director Neil Affleck, also in his first Family Guy episode. Peter Shin and Roy Allen Smith, who have since supervised other episodes of Family Guy, both acted as supervising directors on this episode. Alex Borstein, the voice of Lois, helped write this episode, making her the first female member in the Family Guy writing staff; show creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned that her input on the character of Lois was particularly helpful. Andrew Gormley and voice actor Mike Henry acted as staff writers for this episode, while Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman and Chris Sheridan worked as the story editors. The subplot of \\"The Son Also Draws\\" that involved Lois losing the car was based on the 1985 comedy film Lost in America. The part where Peter pretends to be an Indian to get the family car back was inspired by real-life instances of people who were \\"1/64th\\" Native American receiving money from wealthy casino tribes. In addition to the regular cast, \\"The Son Also Draws\\" featured the voices of actors Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman and actor Patrick Bristow. Cultural references The television show the family is watching near the beginning of the show is an episode from the 1974 ABC sitcom Happy Days. When the rest of the family is gone on the trip to Manhattan, Brian watches an episode of Nova, which is interrupted by a PBS announcement that they will be showing various episodes of One Day at a Time. Speed and Pops from Speed Racer make an appearance at the Soap Box Derby starting line and again when the Griffins prepare to leave for Manhattan. When Peter has to search for his spiritual guide, it turns out to be Fonzie from Happy Days. The song sung by trees is Cats in the Cradle by Harry Chapin. The end of the episode features a parody of the series of public service announcements The More You Know. Reception Reviews for \\"The Son Also Draws\\" were mixed to favorable. In a 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8/10, stating that while the episode is not an \\"instant classic\\", it is \\"still quite strong\\" and has \\"more than a few clever moments\\". He also notes that the cutaways are \\"kept to a minimum\\", and much of the humor comes from the storyline. He commented that the episode did not have as many laugh- out-loud moments as other episodes, but stated that it had bolder humor than the show would later be known for. In his review of the first volume DVD collection of Family Guy, Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk listed \\"The Son Also Draws\\" as one of the series' \\"most brilliant moments\\", praising the spiritual vision sequence and naming the conversation between Peter and Brian among the best moments of the series, calling the conversation \\"rolling-on-the-floor funny.\\" Robin Pierson of The TV Critic, however, was far more hostile towards the episode, giving it the lowest rating of the season, a 44 out of 100. Pierson believed the episode was \\"very poor\\" and called the storyline \\"lame\\" and \\"unfocussed ,\\" with \\"a bunch of jokes to match.\\" The gag at the end of the episode, in which Peter states that \\"Canada sucks\\", inspired anger from Canadian viewers of the show, which led them to send letters to the show's producers. Ricky Blitt, the writer of the episode and the person responsible for the controversial gag, is Canadian. Home media \\"The Son Also Draws\\" and the complete first and second seasons of the series were released under the title Family Guy Volume One; this standard four-disc DVD box set debuted in Region 1 on April 15, 2003, three months before the premiere of the third season. Distributed by 20th Century Fox Television, it included several DVD extras such as episode commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, and online promo spots. The same episodes, without the special features, were released in Region 2 on November 12, 2001 and in Region 4 on October 20, 2003. References * Callaghan, Steve. \\"The Son Also Draws\\".

He kept goal for Arsenal in the 1927 FA Cup Final where a mistake by him saw Cardiff City win the cup. Playing career Born in Maerdy, Glamorgan, Lewis first played for local clubs, before moving to London and joining Clapton Orient. His move to the big time came in 1924 when he joined First Division Arsenal. He made his debut for the Gunners on 15 November 1924 against Everton; Arsenal won 3–2 and Lewis remained for the next thirteen games. However, after letting in five in a match at home to Huddersfield Town on 14 February 1925, Lewis was dropped. After Herbert Chapman arrived as Arsenal manager in 1925, Lewis shared goalkeeping duties with Jock Robson and Bill Harper, but Lewis gradually became the club's No. 1, particularly after Robson and Harper left in 1926 and 1927 respectively. He won his first cap for Wales in a 3–3 draw against England on 12 February 1927. In all he won three caps, the last of which was a 6–0 defeat by England at Stamford Bridge on 20 November 1929. Lewis was the Arsenal goalkeeper in the 1927 FA Cup Final against Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium; it was the Gunners' first Cup final. In the 74th minute, Cardiff striker Hughie Ferguson hit a tame shot straight at Lewis, who dived down to make what should have been a comfortable save. However, Lewis fumbled the ball as he gathered it, and it slipped between his body and the crook of his elbow; Lewis turned around and tried in vain to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it with his elbow into the back of the net. Cardiff won the match 1–0, the only time a Welsh club has won the FA Cup. Lewis blamed his brand new jersey for the error, saying the wool was too greasy for him to grip the ball properly; since then, according to club legend, no Arsenal goalkeeper has played in a new jersey before it is washed first.http://www.goalkeepersaredifferent.com/keepers/getting-shirty.html Lewis continued to play as Arsenal's regular goalkeeper for the next three seasons. However, when they reached Wembley for their second Cup final in 1930, Lewis was injured and had major surgery on a knee. He never fully recovered from this which effectively finished his football career. Arsenal beat Huddersfield 2–0 to claim their first major trophy. Lewis hardly featured at all the following season, particularly after the signings of Bill Harper (for a second spell) and Gerard Keizer. He was transferred to Gillingham in May 1931. In all he played 169 matches for Arsenal. Lewis played only six times for Gillingham and apparently retired from professional football soon after. He died in 1965, at the age of 62.

She was their largest ship at the time. The ship made her first voyage to the Dutch East Indies in 1651. After several voyages, she sank near Madagascar in 1662. A replica of the Prins Willem was built in 1985, but she was destroyed by fire in 2009. Prins Willem, 1650, De VOCsite. Retrieved 6 August 2015. History The ship Prins Willim was built in 1650 in Middelburg in the Dutch Republic. Curiously, the name on the ship was Prins Willim. Two possible reasons have been advanced: the ship's name is Middle Dutch or the lack of space for the name caused the \\"e\\" to be changed to a shorter \\"i\\". The ship was the flagship of Witte de With in the Battle of the Kentish Knock during the First Anglo-Dutch War. The ship sank near Madagaskar in 1662.  Replicas  In the same period as the building of the original ship also a replica in 1:50 scale was built. This model still survives and is on permanent exhibition in the Dutch national museum Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. In 1978 this model was fully restorated and a replica of the same scale was constructed. A full size replica with the same name was built in 1984–85 at the Dutch shipyard Amels in Makkum for the theme park in Seihi, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. The building cost was 1.4 billion yen. In 2003, Huis Ten Bosch K. K., the operating company of Nagasaki Holland Village declared bankruptcy and the replica was sold to a Dutch company for 130 million yen. In 2004, the replica became part of the theme park Cape Holland in Den Helder, the Netherlands. In 2009, the bowsprit of the Prins Willim replica was being restored. The replica ship after the fire in 2009 On the morning of 30 July 2009, the replica was lost to fire, probably due to an electric malfunction. The owner of the ship, the Libéma company, decided on a restoration. In 2014 the ship was dismantled, as the restoration turned out to be too expensive.

He was a member of the band from December 1976 to August 1977 and was replaced by Andy Summers, who had originally been part of the band as a second guitarist.Sutcliffe, Phil (1993). \\"The Hard Line\\". In Message in a Box: The Complete Recordings (pp.28–29) [Boxed set booklet]. A&M; Records Ltd. Following his departure from the band, Padovani was handed the rhythm guitar spot with Wayne County & the Electric Chairs, who at the time were far better known than the Police. BiographyEarly life and punk years= Henri Padovani grew up between Algeria and Corsica from Santo-Pietro-di-Venaco. While studying Economics at Aix-en- Provence, he began listening to Jimi Hendrix and was inspired to form his own band, Lupus, made up of various school friends. He moved to London in December 1976, where a friend took him to one of Curved Air's last gigs. Though unimpressed by the performance, afterward he ended up talking with American expatriate drummer Stewart Copeland, who showed him some songs he'd been writing and introduced him to the rising punk scene. After a show at the Roxy Club, Padovani decided he wanted to join a punk band and shaved off his waist- length hair and beard. He then auditioned for the band London and was offered the job.Sutcliffe, Phil & Fielder, Hugh (1981). L'Historia Bandido. London and New York: Proteus Books. . However, when he told Copeland of his success, Copeland petitioned him to join his own band, The Police. Copeland was already under the impression that he had convinced singer and bassist Sting to join, but despite heavy use of word-of-mouth and advertisements in musical publications, Padovani was the only guitarist he could find who was interested in punk and had actual playing ability. Copeland later recalled of Henry Padovani: > He couldn't speak much English but he'd picked up some musicians' slang and > he used to say 'Where can I put my homp (amplifier)? or 'where do I put my > rope (lead)?'. He knew a few chords and he was really enthusiastic and when > he'd had his hair cut and stuff he really looked the part. I mean, he could > play guitar better than I could and I could play guitar better than Joe > Strummer... well, in those days. So I reckoned he'd be OK but I didn't > figure Sting would see it that way... With Sting on lead vocals and bass guitar, Padovani on lead guitar and Copeland doubling on rhythm guitar as well as drums, the Police recorded in February 1977 their first single \\"Fall Out\\" b/w \\"Nothing Achieving\\" which the band released on 1 May 1977. However Sting was dissatisfied with Padovani's technical abilities, paving the way for Andy Summers, whom they met after a brief tour as part of Mike Howlett's band Strontium 90. For a brief period between July and August 1977, the Police performed as a four-piece with Padovani and Summers sharing guitar duties. Having insisted from the start that he wanted to be the sole guitarist for the band, Summers was unhappy with the situation. Padovani himself felt that the disparity in technical ability between the two of them made this an awkward lineup. The night after an aborted studio session with former Velvet Underground multi-instrumentalist John Cale in the producer's chair, Copeland called Padovani and asked him to leave the band.Summers, Andy (2006). One Train Later. New York: St. Martin's Press. . Being cast out of the Police did not slow Padovani's musical career. After taking a two-month vacation in Corsica, he returned to London and was immediately handed the rhythm guitar spot with Wayne County & the Electric Chairs, who at the time were far better known than the Police. The Police were actually their support act in 1977. The band's first album with Padovani, Storm the Gates of Heaven, was also his debut as a songwriter. Besides a pair of group compositions, he wrote the music for the song \\"Cry of Angels\\". After one more album, Things Your Mother Never Told You, Wayne County & the Electric Chairs split in two. Padovani remained with bassist Val Haller and drummer J.J. Johnson, and the trio recorded a final single, \\"So Many Ways\\", as simply The Electric Chairs, before management problems forced them to disband completely. During this period, Padovani and Haller took turns on lead vocals. = New directions = The collaboration among Padovani, Haller, and Johnson did not end with the breakup of the Electric Chairs. In 1980, they put together a band called The Mystere Five's, which consisted of the three of them as well as Chris Reeves, who played guitar. Marc \\"Frenchie\\" Gloder, who had no performance role in the band but wrote all the lyrics, designed the sleeves to their records, and owned the record label. All the members except Gloder did lead vocals. The group used a deliberately anonymous image, never crediting individual members. Except for a cover of \\"Shake Some Action\\" by Flamin' Groovies, all their songs were credited as being written and produced by the group as a whole. The Mystere Five's recorded two indie singles that were released in 1980, \\"Shake Some Action\\" b/w \\"No Message\\" and \\"Never Say Thank You\\" b/w \\"Heart Rules the Head\\". Both were successful, receiving good reviews (New Musical Express called the first single \\"A perfect record\\" and later reviewed the second single as being \\"actually better\\"), high placings in the indie charts, and a good deal of radio play. However, by the time the singles were released, the band members had moved to other projects, with Padovani having formed The Flying Padovanis. This new band released the double A-sided single \\"Western Pasta\\" b/w \\"Vas plus haut\\" (1981). The Flying Padovanis recorded an album, They Call Them Crazy (also released under the title Font L'Enfer), before disbanding at the end of 1987. In 1988, Henri took part in the recording of Johnny Thunders & Patti Palladin – Copy Cats along with Wayne County. In 1988, Miles Copeland III, the Police's manager, and elder brother of Stewart Copeland, appointed Padovani as Vice President of IRS Records, a role he performed until 1994. He then managed the Italian musician Zucchero for five years. After a five-year sabbatical, Padovani returned to guitar playing. In 1998 he contributed to a Johnny Thunders tribute album by performing \\"Cosa Nostra\\". He recorded a solo album, À croire que c'était pour la vie, in 2007 with record producer Yves Aouizerate. The album was sung in French, and both Stewart Copeland and Sting played on the track \\"Welcome Home\\", representing the first time that the original members of the Police had recorded together since \\"Fall Out\\". Manu Katché, Steve Hunter, Glen Matlock and Chris Musto (of the Flying Padovanis) also appeared on the album. Padovani also wrote the score for the films La Vie comme elle va (2005) and Ici Najac, à vous la Terre (2006 Cannes Film Festival official selection). In 2006 he published his autobiography Secret Police Man, recounting episodes of his lifestyle in the late 1970s and the early days of The Police. Padovani was a judge for the spring 2011 season of X Factor in France, on the television channel M6. =Band reunions= The Flying Padovanis reformed in 2007 for an album Three for Trouble released in May that year, followed by a tour which included an appearance at the Fuji rock festival in Japan. Padovani often appears live on stage with his friend Rachid Taha. During the 2007 The Police Reunion Tour, Padovani joined the band on stage for the final encore of their show in Paris on 29 September. The Police as a four-piece played \\"Next to You\\" from the band's first album Outlandos d'Amour.

He is married to singer-songwriter Sam Phillips, with whom he has toured and recorded. Gorfain studied music at UCLA and won a scholarship to spend a semester at the Sakuyo Junior College of Music in Japan. He worked as a studio violinist and became fluent in Japanese. Beginning in 1991, he toured and recorded with musicians in Japan, then returned to Los Angeles three years later. In 1995, he was hired to work on the reunion tour of Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. He followed the tour to Japan where his knowledge of Japanese allowed him to act as translator. The Section Quartet Soon after the Led Zeppelin tour, he formed the Section Quartet, which calls itself \\"a rock band with strings\\". Gorfain said the quartet was inspired by his time with Plant and Page and by an ambition to play lead guitar in a rock band. He wrote an arrangement for the song \\"Dazed and Confused\\" by Led Zeppelin and recorded it on the album No Electricity Required (2004). The album includes cover versions of songs by the rock bands Coldplay, Kiss, Iron Maiden, and Queens of the Stone Age. The quartet's members are violinists Eric Gorfain and Daphne Chen, cellist Richard Dodd, and violist Leah Katz. They are classical musicians who also work on soundtracks and pop music albums, such as Stripped (RCA, 2002) by Christina Aguilera.

He graduated with a B.S. and M.A. in Physics and did extensive theoretical and experimental research on the Mössbauer effect. He died in San Diego on February 4, 2010 after a period of illness. Holliday became one of the first 100 employees of Tracor in 1962 and quickly became Director of Analysis and Applied Research in the Electronic Systems Division. In 1965 Holliday left Austin to develop the Tracor facility in San Diego and began his doctorate in applied physics at the University of California, San Diego. In San Diego Holliday began his study in acoustics for which he is known. His study of transient flow in natural gas pipelines led to the publication of a textbook which is still used as a standard reference. In the 1970s Holliday began testing a revolutionary technique for the detection and size measurement of zooplankton in thin layers involving multi-frequency backscattering. The technique developed and after twenty years became the established framework for research in the field. In the early 1980s Holliday built the first prototype of the Tracor Acoustical Profiling System (TAPS) which has been described as decades ahead of its time by the Acoustical Society of America. TAPS is now the standard instrument for acoustical profiling of plankton in the sea. Holliday published hundreds of papers on underwater acoustics and acoustical oceanography and given dozens of talks and symposia in several countries. In 2004 Holliday became only the third recipient of the Acoustical Society of America Silver Medal in Acoustical Oceanography, for \\"contributions to the study of marine life, from plankton to whales\\". Holliday was awarded the Prix d'Excellence by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in recognition of extraordinary contributions, fulfilling the ICES vision of scientific discovery, leadership, and applications that have had major influence on policy for sustained use and conservation of marine ecosystems. The Award was presented at the ICES Annual Science Conference on Monday September 22, 2008. The research vessel R/V Dale Van Holliday is operated by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center of the NOAA Fisheries Service. Holliday died on February 4, 2010 at the age of 69 from complications of heart surgery, which was in turn caused by complications from the scoliosis which he had battled his entire life. The Acoustical Society of America organized a session in his memory during its 162nd Meeting, on October 31, 2011.

Born in San Francisco, his playing career was mostly with the Cincinnati Reds from 1922 to 1927. He also played with the Chicago White Sox (1918) and Detroit Tigers (1920). After that he became a highly regarded National League umpire from 1935 to 1956, officiating in 6 World Series: 1939, 1941, 1947, 1948 (outfield only), 1952 and 1956; he was crew chief for the final two Series. He also umpired in the All-Star game in 1937, 1941, 1950 and 1956, working behind home plate for the second half of the last three games, and he worked in the 3-game series to determine the NL champion in 1946. Pinelli wrote an article for The Second Fireside Book of Baseball, titled \\"Kill the Umpire? Don't Make Me Laugh!\\" in which he told about his rookie year of 1935, when he was told that he should not call a strike on Babe Ruth, who was winding up his career with the Boston Braves. Pinelli did not see it that way. When he was behind the plate and Ruth came to bat, and a close pitch went by at which Ruth did not swing, Pinelli deemed it a strike and so called it. Ruth turned to the umpire and bellowed, \\"There's forty thousand people in this park that know that was a ball, tomato-head!\\" Pinelli did not lose his cool. He replied calmly, \\"Perhaps—but mine is the only opinion that counts.\\" Ruth had no answer for that. His final game as a home plate umpire provided an extraordinary capstone to his career. He was behind the plate for Don Larsen's perfect Game 5 in the 1956 World Series.Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures, 2008 Edition, p.42, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, His final call as a plate ump presumably was \\"Strike 3! You're out!\\" to pinch-hitter Dale Mitchell. Pinelli later recalled that after the game, he returned to the umpires' room and burst into tears. It has often been reported that that was Pinelli's final game as an umpire, but that is incorrect; Pinelli was a field umpire for the final two games of the Series, and then called it a career. In his book The Game of Baseball, Gil Hodges recounted a story of how, while dressing for a game, he and several other Brooklyn Dodgers debated which umpires were most likely and least likely to eject a player from a game. Hodges recalled that Pee Wee Reese expressed the opinion that Pinelli was the umpire least likely to throw a player out. Reese was indeed ejected from that day's game—by Pinelli. Pinelli died at age 89 in Daly City, California. He was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.

Career  Born in Saint-Étienne, Simondon was a student of philosopher of science Georges Canguilhem, philosopher Martial Guéroult, and phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Sorbonne. He defended his doctoral dissertations in 1958 at the University of Paris. His main thesis, L'individuation à la lumière des notions de Forme et d'Information (Individuation in the light of the notions of Form and Information), was published in two parts, the first in 1964 under the title L'individu et sa génèse physico-biologique (Individuation and its physical-biological genesis) at the Presses Universitaires de France, while it is only in 1989 that Aubier published the second part, L'individuation psychique et collective (Psychic and collective individuation). While his main thesis, which laid the foundations of his thinking, was not widely read until it was commented upon by Gilles Deleuze and, more recently, Bruno Latour and Bernard Stiegler, his complementary thesis, Du mode d'existence des objets techniques (On the mode of existence of technical objects) was published by Aubier immediately after being completed (in 1958) and had an instant impact on a wide audience. It was only in 2005 that Jérôme Millon published a complete edition of the main thesis.  Individuation and technology  In L'individuation psychique et collective, Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation, in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation, rather than as a cause. Thus the individual atom is replaced by the never-ending process of individuation. Simondon also conceived of \\"pre- individual fields\\" as the resources making individuation itself possible. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a \\"pre- individual\\" left-over, itself making possible future individuations. Furthermore, psychic individuation always creates both an individual and a collective subject, which individuate themselves together. Simondon criticized Norbert Wiener's theory of cybernetics, arguing that \\"Right from the start, Cybernetics has accepted what all theory of technology must refuse: a classification of technological objects conducted by means of established criteria and following genera and species.\\" Simondon aimed to overcome the shortcomings of cybernetics by developing a \\"general phenomenology\\" of machines.  Influence  Simondon's theory of individuation through transduction in a metastable environment was an important influence on the thought of Gilles Deleuze, whose Différence et répétition (1968), Logique du sens (1969) and L'île déserte (2002) make explicit reference to Simondon's work. Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique (1994), the proceedings of the first conference devoted to Simondon's work, further charts his influence on such thinkers as François Laruelle, Gilles Châtelet, Anne Fagot-Largeau, Yves Deforge, René Thom, and Bernard Stiegler (the latter having placed Simondon's theory of individuation at the very heart of his ongoing and multi-volume philosophical project). Another contributor to Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique, Simondon's friend John Hart, was the instigator of the very first translation—from French into English c.1980—of Simondon's work (this at University of Western Ontario in Canada where Hart had founded both a Department of Computer Science and a Simondon-inspired network: the ATN, or Audio Tactile Network in 1964Mark Hayward and Ghislain Thibault, 'Machinic Milieus: Simondon, John Hart and Mechanology',From Disability History Newsletter, Fall 2013). Currently, Simondon can be seen as a major influence on the work of such scholars as Paolo Virno, Jean-Hugues Barthélémy, Thierry Bardini, Luciana Parisi, Brian Massumi, Adrian Mackenzie, Muriel Combes, Carl Mitcham, Andrew Feenberg, Yuk Hui, Isabelle Stengers, Thomas LaMarre, Bruno Latour and Anne Sauvagnargues.

The group was formed in 1983 as Zlatni Dukati. After a tour of America organized by the Croatian Fraternal Union, the band started to compose more music about Croatia. This came to coincide with the Croatian War of Independence which brought such traditional music back into the spotlight. In 1997 the group changed its name from Zlatni Dukati to Najbolji Hrvatski Tamburaši. The band was signed to Croatia Records. History Zlatni Dukati's first album was titled Ni sokaci nisu što su nekad bili. The album was released by then Jugoton, now Croatia Records. The original band members were: * Zoran Bucković-prim * Stanko Šarić-basprim * Zdravko Šljivac-basprim * Zeljko Miloš (Yinks)-celo * Mario Pleše-kontra * Mato Lukačević-bas * Marijan Majdak-Vocals In the above-mentioned formation, Zlatni Dukati played only one season. Lukačević and Šarić continued to play under the name Zlatni Dukati. They were joined with group of tambura players from Štitar in Slavonia. The leader of this group was Šima Dominković and the other members were: Andrija Miličić, Mato Miličić, Mirko Gašparović, Josip Dominković, Mato Lukačević and Stanko Šarić. They were later joined by Hrvoje Majić. For the next few years, Zlatni Dukati performed exclusively in Slavonia around Županja. In 1985, the group split due to internal problems. In 1986, Lukačević and Stjepan Bogutovac reformed Zlatni Dukati. The band now consisted of: * Petar Nikolić-violin * Hrvoje Majić-basprim * Mirko Gašparović-basprim * Stjepan Bogutovac-basprim * Mato Miličić(Pista)-kontra * Mato Lukačević-bas This group also performed around Županja. During 1986 and 19876, Zlatni Dukati played weekly at the \\"Tavern Kristal\\". At the end of 1986, Šarić rejoined the band and Nikolić left it. During the summer of 1987, Zlatni Dukati started its first Croatian tour with the help of music agency \\"Lira\\" from Cakovec. The band members for the tour were: * Hrvoje Majić-prim * Mirko Gašparović-basprim * Stjepan Bogutovac- basprim * Stanko Šarić-basprim * Mato Miličić (Pista)-kontra * Mato Lukačević- bas In 1988, Zlatni Dukati started working with composer Josip Ivanković and released the album Nek zvone tambure. After disagreements with Ivanković, Bogutovac left the band. The rest of Zlatni Dukatiand Ivanković then released several successful albums. During their tour of the United States, Zlatni Dukati decided to record an album of ith Croatian patriotic songs. The name of that album was Hrvatska Pjesmarica. This release was a great success and contributed to the popularization of tambura music. During and after the war in 1991, Zlatni Dukati continued to record patriotic songs. That album was U meni Hrvatsk which reportedly boosted the morale of Croatian soldiers on the front lines. In 1996, due to disagreements, Ivankovic ended his association with Zlatni Dukati. In 1997, due to litigation with Ivankovic , \\"Zlatni Dukati\\" changed its name to \\"Najbolji Hrvatski Tamburaši\\" .

People celebrate their name days () on the date corresponding to their own given names. Slovak culture has accorded similar importance to a person's name day to his or her birthday. The list of the names assigned to the corresponding date is normally published in the calendar. However, there are only one or two names listed in the calendar, even if more names are assigned to a date. The names in bold are listed in the calendar, the others are not. Children in Slovakia usually have names from this list. The most notable exceptions are the names in minority languages (such as Hungarian names) or a foreign name if the parents have a written proof from the corresponding embassy that the name really exists.

Afghanite is a feldspathoid of the cancrinite group and typically occurs with sodalite group minerals. It forms blue to colorless, typically massive crystals in the trigonal crystal system. The lowering of the symmetry from typical (for cancrinite group) hexagonal one is due to ordering of Si and Al. It has a Mohs hardness of 5.5 to 6 and a specific gravity of 2.55 to 2.65. It has refractive index values of nω=1.523 and nε=1.529. It has one direction of perfect cleavage and exhibits conchoidal fracture. It fluoresces a bright orange. Afghanite It was discovered in 1968 in the Lapis-lazuli Mine, Sar-e-Sang, Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan and takes its name from that country. It has also been described from localities in Germany, Italy, the Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, New York and Newfoundland. It occurs as veinlets in lazurite crystals in the Afghan location and in altered limestone xenoliths within pumice in Pitigliano, Tuscany, Italy.

The origins of the theatre date to 1765. Managed by Samuel Arnold, from 1794 to 1809 the building hosted a variety of entertainments including a circus produced by Philip Astley, a chapel, and the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussaud. From 1816 to 1830, it served as The English Opera House. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by Samuel Beazley. The building was unique in that it has a balcony overhanging the dress circle. It was built by the partnership of Peto & Grissell. The theatre then played opera, adaptations of Charles Dickens novels and James Planché's \\"fairy extravaganzas\\", among other works. From 1871 to 1902, Henry Irving appeared at the theatre in, especially, Shakespeare, usually starring opposite Ellen Terry. In 1904 the theatre was almost completely rebuilt and richly ornamented in Rococo style by Bertie Crewe, but it retained Beazley's façade and grand portico. It played mostly melodrama over the ensuing decades. The building closed in 1939 and was set to be demolished, but it was saved and converted into a Mecca Ballroom in 1951, styled the Lyceum Ballroom, where many well-known bands played. The Lyceum was closed in 1986 but restored to theatrical use in 1996 by Holohan Architects.Earl and Sells (2000), pp. 123–24. Since 1999, the theatre has hosted The Lion King. HistoryEarly years= In 1765, a building was erected on an adjacent site by the architect James Payne for the exhibitions of The Society of Artists, which disbanded three years later when the Royal Academy of Arts succeeded it. The building was then leased out for dances and other entertainments, including musical entertainments by Charles Dibdin. Famed actor David Garrick also performed there. In 1794, the composer Samuel Arnold Sr rebuilt the interior of the building, making it into a proper theatre, but through the opposition of the existing patent theatres, he was not granted a patent. Therefore, he leased it to other entertainments again, including Philip Astley, who brought his circus there when his amphitheatre was burned down at Westminster. It was also used as a chapel, a concert room, and for the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussauds in 1802.Pope, W. Macqueen and Ronald Mayes. \\"The Lyceum Theatre, Wellington Street, London\\", Arthur Lloyd, accessed 16 October 2015 The theatre finally became a licensed house in 1809, and until 1812 it was used for dramatic performances by the Drury Lane Company after the burning of their own theatre, until the erection of the new edifice. It staged one of the earliest tableaux vivants, as part of William Dimond's The Peasant Boy in 1811. In 1816, Samuel Arnold rebuilt the house to a design by Beazley and opened it as The English Opera House, but it was destroyed by fire in 1830. The house was famous for hosting the London première of Mozart's opera Così fan tutte (9 May 1811)Londontown profile of the theatre and as the first theatre in Britain to have its stage lit by gas (6 August 1817). During this period, the \\"Sublime Society of Beef Steaks,\\" which had been founded in 1735 by theatre manager Henry Rich, had its home at the theatre for over 50 years until 1867. The members, who never exceeded twenty-four in number, met every Saturday night to eat beefsteaks and drink port wine. =Present site= Eliza Vestris in The Alcaid In 1834, the present house opened slightly to the west, with a frontage on Wellington Street,Wellington Street was a new thoroughfare constructed between Waterloo Bridge and Bow Street. The former site became an unsuccessful arcade, which was demolished to build the Strand Musick Hall (sic), another unsuccessful venture. In 1868, the auditorium was rebuilt and it reopened as the Gaiety Theatre. under the name Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House. The theatre was again designed by Beazley and cost £40,000. The new house championed English opera rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier in the century.Gordon-Powell, Robin. Ivanhoe, full score, Introduction, vol. I, p. VII, 2008, The Amber Ring Composer John Barnett produced a number of works in the first few years of the theatre, including The Mountain Sylph (1834), credited as the first modern English opera. It was followed by Fair Rosamund in 1837 and Farinelli in 1839 (both at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane), and Blanche of Jersey here in 1840. In 1841–43, composer Michael William Balfe managed the theatre and produced National Opera here, but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful. From 1844 to 1847 the theatre was managed by husband and wife team Robert Keeley and Mary Anne Keeley, during which period the house became associated with adaptations of Charles Dickens's novels and Christmas books. For instance, an adaptation of Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit ran for over 100 performances from 1844–45 here, a long run for the time. The Lyceum was later managed by Madame Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Charles James Mathews from 1847–55, who produced James Planché's \\"[fairy] extravaganzas\\" featuring spectacular stage effects. Their first big success was John Maddison Morton's Box and Cox. Tom Taylor's adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities, with Dickens himself as consultant, played in 1860, shortly after end of its serialisation and volume publication. Charles Fechter, who managed the theatre from 1863–67 also favored spectacular productions. In 1866, Dion Boucicault's The Long Strike (his adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Manchester novels Mary Barton and Lizzie Leigh) was produced here. Ethel Lavenu, the mother and grandmother of actors Tyrone Power, Sr. and Tyrone Power performed in a number pieces at the theatre in the 1860s. W. S. Gilbert produced three plays here. In 1863, his first professional play, Uncle Baby, premièred.Crowther (2011), p. 45 In 1867, he presented his Christmas pantomime, called Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren, and in 1884, he produced the drama Comedy and Tragedy.\\"Lyceum Theatre\\", The Times, 27 December 1867; Howarth, Paul. \\"Comedy and Tragedy\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 14 August 2011, accessed 4 October 2016 In 1889, the world's finest Italian dramatic tenor, Francesco Tamagno, appeared at the Lyceum, singing the leading role in the first London production of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Otello. =Irving years= Sir Henry Irving Beginning in 1871, under manager Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman and his wife Sidney Frances Bateman, Henry Irving appeared at the theatre in, among other things, many Shakespeare works. Irving began with the French melodrama The Bells, an instant hit in which he played the ghost-haunted burgomaster. The piece ran to sell-out crowds for 150 nights, which was an unusually long run at the time. Charles I, in 1872 was another hit, running for 180 nights. In 1874, Irving played Hamlet at the theatre, perhaps his greatest triumph, running for 200 nights. In 1878, after Bateman's death, Irving took over management of the theatre from his widow. The Builder, 28 September 1878 reported that there was a difference between Irving and Mrs. Bateman regarding the personnel of the company at the Lyceum. \\"Mr. Irving is said to have told Mrs. Bateman that he was resolved to have actors to act with him, and not dolls, otherwise he would no longer play at the Lyceum. The result was that Mrs. Bateman threw up the management of the theatre, and Mr. Irving takes her place.\\" Mrs. Bateman became the manager of Sadler's Wells Theatre. Irving continued to star in plays there, especially Shakespeare, until 1902, engaging co-star Ellen Terry for that entire period of 24 years. Bram Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898 as business manager of the theatre, and Irving was Stoker's real-life inspiration for the character Count Dracula in his 1897 novel, Dracula. Stoker hoped that Irving, with his dramatic, sweeping gestures, gentlemanly mannerisms, and speciality in playing villain roles, would play Dracula in the stage adaptation of his novel. However, Irving never agreed to appear in the stage version, although the play was produced at the Lyceum. Ellen Terry as Katherine in Henry VIII Irving and Terry began with Hamlet in 1878. Their 1879 production of The Merchant of Venice ran for an unusual 250 nights, and success followed success in the Shakespeare canon as well as in other major plays.Information from Schoolnet.com Other celebrated productions included Much Ado About Nothing, The Lady of Lyons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1878), Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, The Lyons Mail by Charles Reade (1883), the immensely popular Faust by William Gorman Wills (1885, which even drew applications for reserved seats from foreigners), Macbeth (1888, with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan\\"Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's Macbeth, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 January 2005, accessed 21 August 2016; Hugill, Robert. \\"Mendelssohnian charm: Sir Arthur Sullivan's Macbeth and The Tempest\\", PlanetHugill.com, 15 August 2016), Henry VIII (1892),Review and drawings of Henry VIII, Punch magazine, Vol. 102, 16 January 1892, p. 33 Becket by Alfred Tennyson (1893), King Arthur by J. Comyns Carr, with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan (1895), Cymbeline (1896) and Victorien Sardou and Émile Moreau's play Madame Sans-Gêne (1897). When Irving and Terry toured America, as they did several times beginning in 1883, the theatre played works with many famous actors including Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Sarah Bernhardt, and Eleonora Duse. Martin Harvey, a pupil of Irving's played a season there in 1899. Benoît-Constant Coquelin appeared as Cyrano de Bergerac in the summer of 1898. =Later years= King Arthur at the theatre, 1895 After being bought by Thomas Barrasford, in 1904 the theatre was rebuilt and richly ornamented in rococo style by Bertie Crewe, retaining only the façade and portico of the original building. The theatre presented music hall and variety, in an attempt to compete with the Palace Theatre and the new Stoll built London Coliseum, but this was not a success, and the theatre soon returned to presenting drama. From 1909–38 the Melville Brothers ran a successful series of spectacular melodramas. In 1919, additional minor alterations to the theatre were made by Edward Jones. Between the wars, dramas played at the theatre for ten months each year, followed by Christmas pantomimes, including Queen of Hearts in 1938. The Lyceum was the last London theatre to continue the early practice of concluding pantomimes with a harlequinade, a free standing entertainment of slapstick clowning, juggling and tumbling. The tradition ended with the closure of the theatre in 1939.The Development of Pantomime (It's Behind You!) accessed 17 October 2007 In 1939, the London County Council bought the building, with plans to demolish it to make room for road improvement. The theatre closed that year with a landmark performance of Hamlet directed by Sir John Gielgud (Ellen Terry's great nephew). The road improvement plans collapsed, and after the war, in 1945, it was converted to a huge ballroom and reopened by Matthews and Sons, as the Lyceum Ballroom. The Miss World contest was staged at the venue every year from 1951 to 1968.\\"1951\\" , Miss World pageant, accessed 12 March 2013 Many big bands played here, including the Oscar Rabin Band which performed frequently. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the theatre was used as a pop concert venue and for television broadcasts. The Grateful Dead, The Groundhogs, The Clash, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Led Zeppelin, Queen, The Police, The Ramones, The Who, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, U2, Colosseum, The Smiths, Iron Maiden and Pink Floyd all played here. Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded their Live! album here on 18–19 July 1975. Genesis filmed a performance there in May 1980 for broadcast on the Old Grey Whistle Test. This footage appears on the 2007 CD/DVD re- release of their 1980 album Duke. Side view of the theatre in 2006, with red Lion King displays visible A proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Vaudeville, Garrick, Adelphi and Duchess theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians' Union, and theatre owners under the auspices of the Save London Theatres Campaign led to the abandonment of the scheme.Vaudeville Theatre accessed 28 March 2007 In 1973, the theatre gained protection and was Grade II* listed as Interior despite adaptation and alteration for present ballroom use retains [a] substantial part of Crewe's work. The theatre went dark in 1986, after the National Theatre's promenade performances (in 1985) of Bill Bryden's adaptation of the Mysteries trilogy. Brent Walker leased the theatre during this time but later gave up his lease, and in 1996 it was restored and reconverted into a theatre for large-scale musicals or opera (with a suitably large orchestra pit) by Holohan Architects. A production of Jesus Christ Superstar played from 1996 to 1998. The theatre has been home to the musical theatre version of The Lion King since 1999. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the production, which had grossed over £289 million and been seen by more than eight million people, 250 former cast members gathered onstage, together with designer-director Julie Taymor. Prime Minister David Cameron and actor James Earl Jones, who voiced the role of King Mufasa in the original Disney animated film, attended the performance.Cavendish, Dominic. \\"The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre\\".

P. Lovecraft. Written in December 1919, it was first published in The Vagrant, May 1920. It tells of a traumatic event in the life of Randolph Carter, a student of the occult loosely representing Lovecraft himself. It is the first story in which Carter appears. Its adaptations include the film The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter. Plot \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" is the first person testimony of the titular character, who has been found wandering through swampland in an amnesiac shock. In his statement, Carter attempts to explain the disappearance of his companion, the occultist Harley Warren. Warren has come into the possession of a book, written in an unknown language, the exact contents of which he never revealed to Carter. Carter mentions that Warren has other \\"strange, rare books on forbidden subjects\\", several of which are in Arabic. From his mysterious book, Warren apparently deduces that doors or stairways exist between the surface world, and the underworld, through which demons may travel. He encourages Carter to travel with him to the location of one such portal, an ancient graveyard near Big Cypress Swamp. Upon arriving, Warren locates a particular tomb, and opens it to reveal a staircase that descends into the earth. Taking a lantern, he leaves Carter on the surface, and follows the stairs into the darkness, communicating with his companion by a telephone wire. After several minutes of silence, Warren suddenly begins to make vague, panicked outbursts that culminate in a desperate plea for Carter to flee. Finally, after Warren is silent for several minutes, Carter calls to him down the line, only to hear an alien voice telling him that Warren is dead. Definitive version. CharactersRandolph Carter= Randolph Carter is one of Lovecraft's most commonly recurring characters. An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia places the events of the story after those of The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath and before \\"The Unnamable\\" or \\"The Silver Key\\". =Harley Warren= Harley Warren is a mysterious occultist who apparently perishes while exploring an underground crypt in Big Cypress Swamp. After his disappearance, Randolph Carter tells police that \\"I have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown.\\" Warren, he says, \\"always dominated me, and sometimes I feared him.\\" He mentions a facial expression of Warren's that caused him to shudder. Warren himself suggests that he sees himself as someone with \\"ironclad sensibilities\\". Carter describes Warren as having a \\"vast collection of strange, rare books on forbidden subjects,\\" many of them apparently in Arabic, with one \\"fiend- inspired book...written in characters whose like I never saw elsewhere.\\" In the dream that inspired the story, the Warren character was actually Lovecraft's friend Samuel Loveman. Loveman also figured in the dream that became the prose poem \\"Nyarlathotep\\". Warren is referred to in other Lovecraft stories. In \\"The Silver Key\\", he is alluded to as \\"a man in the south, who was shunned and feared for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from India and Arabia.\\" In \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\", he is revealed to have come from South Carolina, and to have been an expert linguist of the primal Naacal language of the Himalayas. Warren is also mentioned in Brian Lumley's Titus Crow series, as a member of a Bostonian group of psychics. Inspiration Lovecraft based the story on a dream that he transcribed, adding only a preamble to make it more fluid as a narrative, Explanatory Notes by S. T. Joshi. and wrote it in the form of a testimony given to the police. An account of the actual dream Lovecraft had can be found in one of his letters to August Derleth. Connections The story contains an early statement of a common theme of Lovecraft's—the terrible price of knowledge: This theme is most famously stated in \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\": \\"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\\" Adaptations * \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" and Randolph Carter feature prominently in ‘’Lovecraftian: The Shipwright Circle’’ by Steven Philip Jones.

A 1983 full-length feature film, Dougram: Documentary of the Fang of the Sun, summarized the series. Plot The series begins in a desert on the colony planet Deloyer, where the remains of a destroyed robot are resting as a red-haired woman is standing in front of it. The woman hallucinates what appears to be a group of armed soldiers alongside the robot in a non-destroyed state. A man named Rocky appears, leading to the woman running into his embrace where she cries tears of joy. After this, the series flashes back to an earlier time, in order to explain the circumstances leading up to the first episode. Malcontents on the Deloyer colony agitate for the independence of their world from the Earth Federation. In an unexpected coup, the elected Governor declares martial law and sets himself up as absolute dictator. With the approval of the Federation, he rules the planet with an iron fist. In reaction, a ragtag group (including the governor's estranged son) rises in open rebellion, using a powerful prototype Combat Armor: the Dougram. Their goal is the end of the dictatorship and total independence from the Federation's influence. The story follows the actions of the guerilla freedom fighters known as \\"The Deloyer 7.\\" The war is fought across the planet Deloyer as the Federation vigorously pursues the rebels. The series is noted for its realistic use of not just the combat armors and support vehicles, but also military tactics. The series also followed a wide range of characters and political intrigue, with many shady characters switching sides throughout the series. Crinn Cashim is the show's main character. Son of Governor Donan Cashim, he becomes trained in piloting the Soltic Roundfacer by Jacky Zaltsev, a Federation Ace, because of his father's political connections. When his father appears to be overthrown by a coup led by Colonel Von Stein, he pilots a Roundfacer while Federation forces battle Garcia's forces. He is stunned to learn that his father has actually sided with Von Stein in a secret plan, and eventually becomes angry at his father's forces in how they deal with the rebellion following the coup. Following a meeting with Dr. David Samalin, who introduces him to a combat armor he has designed, the Dougram, Cashim and his friends form The Fang of the Sun and join the rebellion against the Federation. Voice actorsCombat Armors The Dougram Combat Armor In S.C. 140 (Dougram time system, meaning Space Century), the Federal military asked for an all-terrain heavy-weapon system to deal with the varied geographic conditions of the colony worlds. Only two companies made it through the extensive requirements testing: Abitate and Soltic. Abitate's F44A \\"Crabgunner\\" was a 12-meter, 4-legged walking tank. Soltic's own H8 \\"Roundfacer\\" was humanoid, with a single pilot located in the head. The simpler Crabgunner became the mainstay of the early Federation forces, but it was the Roundfacer that would revolutionize mechanized warfare. As the rebellion grows in number, the Federation introduces new models of Combat Armors to oppose it, many of them designed to fulfill specific roles (desert fighting, cold weather deployment, etc.). Unlike other anime, these new machines are production models and rarely one-of-a-kind prototypes (the Dougram itself being the most notable exception). Combat Armors used by the Sun Fang rebels are marked with a gold-bordered red triangle. The Federation Occupation Forces use gold chevrons to indicate the division they are assigned to (1st, 2nd, or 3rd). The following list showcases the machines seen in the show. The terms \\"Soltic\\" and \\"Abitate,\\" actually represent the names of the companies that built the combat armors, not the names of the machines themselves. The \\"common names,\\" if any, are given in quotes. =First Generation= *Abitate F44A \\"Crab Gunner\\": Height: 12.2 m. Weight: 34.621 tons. The first Combat Armor, its design nevertheless influences further designs, although its shortcomings become apparent in battles facing other Combat Armors. In terms of weapons it has a linear gun on its top, armed with a 12.7mm machine gun on the cannon's top, a 30mm machine gun on their front, and a 7-tube missile pod on each side of the body. *Abitate F44B \\"Tequila Gunner\\": Height: 12.13 m. Weight: 35.001 tons. First introduced in by Locke, the Tequila Gunner is used in a support role, much of the time battling the Deloyer 7 team from a distance. In terms of weapons it has a linear gun on its top, armed with a 12.7mm machine gun on the cannon's top, a 30mm cannon in their front, and a 7-tube missile launcher on each side with two under the cockpit. Each side also had a balcony for gunmen. Once the Desert Gunner is developed, the Tequila Gunner is phased out. *Abitate F44D \\"Desert Gunner: Height: 15.87 m. Weight: 35.914 tons. These six-legged armors are apt at negotiating treacherous sand banks in desert environments where bipedal mecha like Dougram, having more weight-per-inch ground pressure, are particularly clumsy and less effective. In terms of weapons it has a linear gun on its top, a 30mm machine gun on their front, and a 9-tube missile pod on each side of the body. Their judicious use by the veteran Garcia Company brings Dougram dangerously close to total defeat. =Second Generation= *Nicholiev AG-9 \\"Cabarov: Height: 9.36 m. Weight: 15.692 tons. A support Combat Armor that only appears near the series, and one of the few Combat Armors not designed by Abitate or Soltic. Unlike other models it is capable of 360 degree rotation at the waist. In terms of weapons it has a double linear cannon on the right side of the head, a 6-tube rocket pod on each hip, and three 30mm machine guns in each side of the head. *Soltic H8 \\"Roundfacer\\": Height: 10.02 m. Weight: 20.965 tons. The mainstay of the Federation's Combat Armor forces, the Roundfacer is versatile and easy to produce. Its service runs right up to the final fight against the rebellion. In terms of weapons it has a 25mm chain gun in each wrist, a 9-tube missile pod on the right shoulder, and can wield either a hand linear gun which acts as a giant machine gun or a mag launcher which acts as a giant grenade launcher. The left shoulder is armed with a shield. Roundfacers can be stripped of their armor for a camouflage suit in heavy foliage terrain. For aerial assaults it can be given a giant hang glider. **Soltic H8-RF \\"Korchima Special\\" (24th Battalion Custom): Height: 10.09 m. Weight: 21.004 tons. This is an upgraded version of the Roundfacer, and only four of them are produced, and used by am elite Federation unit known as the Korchima Battalion. It incorporates a Laser on its forearm in-place of the Roundfacer's Linear Gun, and a powerpack for extended service. The Korchima Special is arguably more powerful than the Dougram, although Cashim's piloting skills gives him the upper-hand. Like standard Roundfacers these can be given a giant hang glider for aerial assaults. *\\"Dougram\\": Height: 9.63 m. Weight: 20.120 tons. Exclusively developed by Samlin, the Dougram is based on the Federation's Roundfacer, and is able to use parts from salvaged Roundfacers to keep it running. During the series the Dougram is customized for various missions, such as utilizing a Hang Glider like the Roundfacer, or a set of anti-aircraft guns to combat the Federation Duey helicopters that Cashim faces all-throughout the series. Its primary weapons consist of a linear gun on the right arm, a chaingun in the left arm, and can be given a turbopack for high jumping and has a large linear cannon that can be mounted on the left shoulder. The final version is known as the JAGD Type which replaces a set of smoke launchers on the sides of its head with a rocket pod similar to those mounted on the Roundfacer. *Abitate T-10B \\"Blockhead\\": Height: 11.78 m. Weight: 31.102 tons. Really a prototype than a production model, this version of the Blockhead sports a red paint job and appears in a group of three that surprise the Deloyer 7 team. In terms of weapons it is armed with a mag launcher which acts like a giant grenade launcher or a double barreled anti-armor rifle, a 6-tube missile launcher on the left shoulder, and a double barreled machine gun turret on the head. Future Blockheads appear as the C Type. **Abitate T-10C \\"Blockhead\\": When the B Type proved successful, the Federation mass-produces the C Type, and it becomes one of the main weapons used by the Federation alongside its Roundfacer units. *Soltic H-102 \\"Bushman\\": Height: 9.38 m. Weight: 18.951 tons. A light-weight Combat Armor originally designed for mountainous terrain. In terms of weapon it has a 6-tube bullet pod on each side of their head and a mag launcher which acts as a giant grenade launcher. The left shoulder is armed with a shield. *Soltic H404S \\"Mackerel\\": Height: 8.7 m. Weight: 19.917 tons. The only amphibious Combat Armor shown in the series, and is used in conjunction with the Federation's Naval Fleets and during a massive D-Day type of landing against rebel forces. In terms of weapons it has a pair of 7-tube missile launchers in the abdomen and eight anti-armor guns in each wrist due to the arms being so large they could not operate normal combat armor firearms. It was capable of swimming up to 24 knots while underwater. =Third Generation= *Soltic HT-128 \\"Bigfoot\\": Height: 11.64 m. Weight: 27.043 tons. The largest and most powerful design of the Combat Armors developed by the Federation, it is used in winter conditions high up on the Kalnock mountain range. In terms of weapons they had a double barreled anti-armor rifle, a pair of smoke dispensers on each side of the neck base, and a 6-tube rocket pod on the left side of the head. While able to contribute to rebel losses, they were are unable to defeat the Dougram. *Hasty F4X \\"Ironfoot\\": Height: 8.94 m. Weight: 29.963 tons. Originally a Federation design, the rebellion incorporates a number of them when an entire Federation army group switches sides during the conflict and joins the rebellion. In terms of weapons it had a linear gun on the right arm, a 9-tube missile pod on the left shoulder, and three smoke dispensers on the left side of the torso. It also goes by the nickname \\"Hasty\\". *Abitate F35C \\"Blizzard Gunner\\": Height: 10.368 m. Weight: 29.65 tons. Deployed late in the series, the Blizzard Gunner becomes one of the main weapons used by the Federation in the region of Kalnock. In terms of weapons it has a linear gun on the main body, a 7-tube missile pod at the top, a 30mm cannon on the left side of their front, and three smoke dispensers on each side of the body. Influence Dougram was one of the first successors to the \\"Real Robot\\" genre created by Mobile Suit Gundam. The popular technical designer Kunio Okawara produced the designs for both shows. Dougram featured a similar plot centered around a small team fighting a running battle with a powerful enemy, using an advanced giant robotic prototype combat armor. The show was a surprise success, especially considering the heavy emphasis on military tactics which slowed the pace of the story, and further confirmed that military 'giant robot' science-fiction was here to stay. Takahashi and Sunrise would go on create a follow-up series, Armored Trooper Votoms, which used similar styling and themes but was otherwise unrelated in plot, characters or setting. Merchandising Toymaker Takara was the show's main licensee. They made a very successful plastic model kit series, a large number of diecast toys, and also released several strategy wargames set in the Dougram world. The latter included tiny, unpainted diecast combat armors as playing pieces; additional scale accessories were available separately. The diecast toys were produced in three sizes. The 1:144 scale \\"Collection Series\\" featured a hollow diecast body and leg structure, with plastic detail parts. The \\"Dual Model Series\\" (in two scales, 1:72 and 1:48) featured a zinc-diecast endoskeleton upon which plastic armor pieces were attached. Although the imported toys were physically identical to the Japanese ones, the packages were modified for American shelves. The 1:144 scale boxes had sleeves to be hung from pegs, while the larger toys had English-language stickers glued over the original boxes. Takara also produced a magnetically jointed Dougram and several soft-vinyl toys. Although the vinyls did not have specific scales, they appeared to be between 1:100 and 1:60 scale. Toy manufacturer Seven, a Takara spin-off devoted to low-end toys, produced several plastic and rubber Dougram toys as well. Dougram appeared in the Harobots games alongside crab gunners and roundfacers. Dougram and both enemy combat armors reappeared in Brave Saga with more combat armors appearing in Brave Saga 2 including Desert Gunners, Cabarov, and Blockheads as well as MP-2 Dueys. Release outside Japan Neither the film nor the television series were released in North America. However, plastic model kit manufacturer Revell released many of Takara's Dougram kits as characters in their Robotech Defender series, and Takara sold much of their diecast toy line through American toy stores in the mid-Eighties. The detailed construction of the toys, the lack of any background info on the characters, and the revolutionary slogans printed on the boxes (\\"Fight! Dougram to save independence of the Deloyer!\\" or \\"We never approve your independence from our federation.\\") confused many. In the mid-1980s, American gaming company FASA Corporation used the vehicle designs of the show for its Battletech miniature wargame and role-playing game. The first edition, then named BattleDroids, actually included two Japanese 1/144 model kits from Dougram. FASA was later sued by Playmates Toys and Harmony Gold USA for using designs from Macross (for example, Valkyrie fighters renamed Stinger, Wasp and Phoenix Hawk). The lawsuit was settled, and as a result post-lawsuit Battletech products no longer feature the designs taken from Macross. However, in the years since, the designs from Macross, Dougram, and Crusher Joe have since been re-introduced, Albeit with completely original artwork. The Dougram tabletop battling game also came out in 1984, the same year Battletech (Battledroids) was released in America.

She wrote short- stories and plays and is perhaps best remembered for her involvement with the explosive Angaaray (1932), a collection of groundbreaking and unconventional short stories written by young writers in Urdu like Sajjad Zaheer and Ahmed Ali. Early life She was born on 25 August 1905 in Aligarh. She was the eldest of five children born to Sheikh Abdullah (educationalist) and his wife Begum Wahid Jahan. Her father, Sheikh Abdullah (not to be confused with the Sheikh Abdullah of Kashmir), was a leading pioneer of women's English-based education in India and established the Women's College, Aligarh at the Aligarh Muslim University, where she had her early education. She left Aligarh to join the Isabella Thoburn College in Lucknow in 1921. Three years later she moved to Lady Hardinge Medical College in Delhi where she trained as a gynecologist. From Delhi, she joined the Provincial Medical Services, and was posted to small towns across north India, from Bahraich to Bulandshahar and Meerut. She was an active member of the Communist Party of India and a leading voice in the Progressive Writers' Association. She married fellow revolutionary Mahmuduz Zafar in 1934. Controversy In December 1932, Rashid Jahan published Angaaray, a collection of groundbreaking and unconventional short stories written in Urdu with Sajjad Zaheer, Sahibzada Mahmuduzaffar and Ahmed Ali. This book railed against social inequity, hypocritical 'maulvis' and the exploitation of women in a deeply patriarchal society. The book was publicly condemned at the central standing committee of the All-India Shia Conference at Lucknow as a \\"filthy pamphlet\\" that had \\"wounded the feelings of the entire Muslim community\\". The Urdu press called for a ban. Clerics issued fatwas. Demonstrations were held outside book stores and the publisher had to issue a written apology and surrender unsold copies to the government. Within three months of its publication, the British had banned this \\"immoral\\" book in March 1933. Of the two pieces that Jahan contributed to Angaaray, one was a short story barely three pages long Dilli ki Sair is a little narrative about a burqa-clad woman watching life on a railway platform waiting for her husband to turn up and take her home. The story is a brief but penetrating meditation on life behind the 'veil' and the blindness of male privilege towards the experience of women behind the purdah. The other piece, Parde Ke Peeche, is a conversation between two women from affluent, sharif (respectable) families. Some of her writings have appeared in collections like Aurat aur Dusre Afsane wa Drame (1937) and Woh aur Dusre Afsane wa Drame (Maktaba Jamia, 1977). Death and legacy Rashid Jahan died in Moscow in July 1952 where she had gone for treatment for uterine cancer. She is buried in a cemetery there. Her younger sister Begum Khurshid Mirza (1918 - 1989) was a noted film actress in British India in the 1930s and 1940s, and later was an accomplished TV actress in Pakistan. Begum Khurshid Mirza's memoirs were published in English in 2005.

Caballero was born and died in Querétaro, Mexico. While still a layman he was mayor of his native city. After taking Holy Orders he held several high offices. He gave large sums of money to several churches, and founded and endowed in his native city the church and college of the Jesuits, enlarged the Franciscan church, built the Dominican church and convent, constructed the Chapel of Our Lady of Loretto, to which he gave all his family jewels, founded the convent of Capuchine nuns, and built a hospital or infirmary in St. Francis' convent. He gave dowries to more than two hundred girls, and left large sums of money for daily charities. In the city of Mexico he rebuilt the church of Santa Clara and contributed generously to the construction of the churches of Sts. Philip Neri and Belen. In Guadalajara he finished the church of St. Dominic, and for the missions of the newly discovered California he gave $150,000. Some years before his death he bequeathed his property for charitable purposes. He was remarkable for his humility and piety. He refused two bishoprics which were offered to him at different times, and the title of Adelantado (governor) of California, which the King of Spain sent him, after his generous donation to those missions. Every year he used to make a spiritual retreat, drawing at the same time his last will, and becoming the executor of his pious bequests until he renewed them the following year. The sums he left for charitable purposes were wonderfully preserved and increased for a century and a half, until the general spoliation of the Church of Mexico.

It is the 36th closest known star system to the Sun and has a relatively high proper motion of 1.2 seconds of arc per year. Wolf 1061 does not have any unusual spectroscopic features. The star was first cataloged in 1919 by German astronomer Max Wolf when he published a list of dim stars that had high proper motions. Wolf 1061's name originates from this list. A seven years study found no evidence of photometric transits and confirms the radial velocity signals are not due to stellar activity. The habitable zone estimate for the system lies between approximately 0.1 and 0.2 AU from the star. Planetary system In December 2015, a team of astronomers from the University of New South Wales announced the discovery of three planets orbiting Wolf 1061. The planets were detected by analyzing 10 years of observations of the Wolf 1061 system by the HARPS spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. The team used archive radial velocity measurements of the star's spectrum in the HARPS data and, along with 8 years of photometry from the All Sky Automated Survey, discovered two definite planets with orbital periods of around 4.9 and 17.9 days and a very likely third with a period of 67.3 days. All three planets have masses low enough that they are likely to be rocky planets similar to the inner planets of the Solar System although their actual sizes and densities are currently unknown. However, this information could be determined if the planets happen to transit in front of Wolf 1061 when viewed from Earth. Because all three planets orbit close to the star and have short orbital periods, there is a chance that this will occur. The University of New South Wales team estimated the chances of a transit at around 14% for planet b, 6% for planet c, and 3% for planet d. One of the planets, Wolf 1061 c, is a super-Earth located near the inner edge of the star's habitable zone, which conservatively extends from 0.11 to 0.21 AU, or at most from 0.09 to 0.23 AU. It is one of the closest known potentially habitable planets to Earth after Proxima b, Ross 128 b, and Luyten b. The next planet out, Wolf 1061 d, could be marginally habitable depending on its atmosphere's composition as it orbits just beyond the habitable zone. In March 2017, another team of astronomers re-analyzed the system using the HARPS spectrograph. They found planets b and c to be quite similar to their originally reported parameters, but found that planet d was more massive and in a larger, more eccentric orbit. The team was also able to find updated parameters for the host star. Their results showed that Wolf 1061 c is slightly smaller, yet closer to the inner edge of the habitable zone.

These are generally palindromic sequences (because restriction enzymes usually bind as homodimers), and a particular restriction enzyme may cut the sequence between two nucleotides within its recognition site, or somewhere nearby.  Function  For example, the common restriction enzyme EcoRI recognizes the palindromic sequence GAATTC and cuts between the G and the A on both the top and bottom strands. This leaves an overhang (an end-portion of a DNA strand with no attached complement) known as a sticky end on each end of AATT. The overhang can then be used to ligate in (see DNA ligase) a piece of DNA with a complementary overhang (another EcoRI-cut piece, for example). Some restriction enzymes cut DNA at a restriction site in a manner which leaves no overhang, called a blunt end. Blunt ends are much less likely to be ligated by a DNA ligase because the blunt end doesn't have the overhanging base pair that the enzyme can recognize and match with a complementary pair. Sticky ends of DNA however are more likely to successfully bind with the help of a DNA ligase because of the exposed and unpaired nucleotides. For example, a sticky end trailing with AATTG is more likely to bind with a ligase than a blunt end where both the 5' and 3' DNA strands are paired. In the case of the example the AATTG would have a complementary pair of TTAAC which would reduce the functionality of the DNA ligase enzyme. Applications Restriction sites can be used for multiple applications in molecular biology such as identifying restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs).

History A Van Hool coach operated jointly with Arriva Shires & Essex on Green Line route 757 easyBus ticket office at London Stansted Airport easyGroup first announced its intention to operate no frills express services in 2003, initially in competition with National Express along the London to Birmingham corridor.Still no date for first EasyBus service Bus & Coach Professional 5 December 2003 Operations began in August 2004, with a service between London and Milton Keynes introduced.EasyBus confirm Milton Keynes start date Bus & Coach Professional 5 August 2004 To keep costs down easyBus originally used Hendon Central station in north London as its terminal point, with a journey time of 65 minutes and a single fare of £5. The threat of competition forced National Express to offer its own discounted fares to and from London, culminating in the introduction of a £1 single fare between Milton Keynes and London which Stelios claimed was intended to make his service non-profitable and force its withdrawal. Shortly after this EasyBus launched a second route to Luton Airport in competition with National Express' Jetlink subsidiary. In Spring 2005 EasyBus changed its London terminus from Hendon to a more central location in Baker Street. The Milton Keynes service was withdrawn in February 2006, with services to Luton increased in frequency and the operational contract transferred to Arriva Shires & Essex. The dedicated service to Luton was withdrawn in May 2007, with services combined with the existing Green Line service 757. A new service to London Stansted Airport began operation at the same time. In July 2008 further expansion was announced with the launch of a half-hourly service between Gatwick Airport and Fulham Broadway station. On 28 July 2010 an EasyBus Optare Soroco minibus overturned on the M25 motorway near the junction with the M23 in Surrey. A black car had lost control and had collided with the minibus, while it was carrying four passengers on a service from Gatwick Airport to London. One person became trapped in the vehicle and was cut free by fire crews. Four people were injured in the accident, including three passengers and the driver of the car. One woman was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting with serious leg injuries. The other three were treated for less severe injuries at East Surrey Hospital, Redhill. The clockwise carriageway of the road between junctions 6 and 8 was closed for six hours following the crash, as was the slip road to the M23. On 15 May 2015, EasyBus opened its second continental route in partnership with SARL Chamexpress and its Paris shuttle service from Paris city centre (Louvre) to Charles de Gaulle Airport. In November 2015 EasyBus withdrew the Stansted to Old Street route, and stopped operating the Stansted to Victoria/Baker Street route using its own vehicles. Instead it acts as a re-seller for National Express services. Stelios Haji-Ioannou tried to object to Stansted offering this route to a rival in court, but was rejected.

Flaperons on a Denney Kitfox Model 3, built in 1991. Flaperons (Junkers style) on an ICP Savannah Model S, built in 2010. Work of the flaperon of Boeing 777 A flaperon (a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on an aircraft's wing is a type of control surface that combines the functions of both flaps and ailerons. Some smaller kitplanes have flaperons for reasons of simplicity of manufacture, while some large commercial aircraft may have a flaperon between the flaps and aileron. Operation In addition to controlling the roll or bank of an aircraft, as do conventional ailerons, both flaperons can be lowered together to reduce stall speed, similarly to a set of flaps. On a plane with flaperons, the pilot still has the standard separate controls for ailerons and flaps, but the flap control also varies the flaperon's range of movement. A mechanical device called a \\"mixer\\" is used to combine the pilot's input into the flaperons. While the use of flaperons rather than ailerons and flaps might seem to be a simplification, some complexity remains through the intricacies of the mixer. Some aircraft, such as the Denney Kitfox, suspend the flaperons below the wing (rather in the manner of slotted flaps) to provide undisturbed airflow at high angles of attack or low airspeeds. When the flaperon surface is hinged below the trailing edge of a wing, they are sometimes named \\"Junker Flaperons\\", from the doppelflügel (lit., \\"double wing\\") type of trailing edge surfaces used on a number of Junkers aircraft of the 1930s, such as the Junkers Ju 52 airliner, and Junkers Ju 87 Stuka iconic World War II dive bomber. Research  Current research seeks to coordinate the functions of aircraft flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons) so as to reduce weight, cost, drag, inertia, and thereby achieve improved control response, reduced complexity, and reduced radar visibility for stealth purposes. Beneficiaries of such research might include drones (UAVs) and the latest fighter aircraft. These research approaches include flexible wings and fluidics: =Flexible wings= In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing is a NASA effort. The Adaptive Compliant Wing is a military and commercial effort. This may be seen as a return to the wing warping used and patented by the Wright brothers. =Fluidics= In fluidics, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger, more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows), where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, fluidics promises lower mass, costs (up to 50% less), and very low inertia and response times, as well as simplicity.

Early life Born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and brought up on a farm, Shrimpton was educated at St Bernard's Convent School, Slough. She enrolled at Langham Secretarial College in London when she was 17. A chance meeting with director Cy Endfield led to an unsuccessful meeting with the producer of his film Mysterious Island (1961); Endfield then suggested she attend the Lucie Clayton Charm Academy's model course. In 1960, aged 17, she began modelling, appearing on the covers of popular magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. Career Shrimpton's career rose to prominence through her work with photographer David Bailey. They met in 1960 at a photo shoot that Shrimpton, who was then an unknown model, was working on with photographer Brian Duffy for a Kellogg's corn flakes advertisement. Duffy told Bailey she was too posh for him, but Bailey was undeterred.

Bailey was still married to his first wife Rosemary Bramble when the affair began, but left her after nine months and later divorced her to be with Shrimpton. Shrimpton's other most celebrated romance was with actor Terence Stamp. In 1979, she married photographer Michael Cox at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, when she was four months pregnant with their son Thaddeus, who was born that same year. They own the Abbey Hotel in Penzance, now managed by Thaddeus and his family. In the media Shrimpton is namechecked (as \\"Jeannie Shrimpton\\") in The Smithereens song \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" (1986). The story of Shrimpton's relationship with David Bailey is dramatised in a BBC Four film, We'll Take Manhattan (26 January 2012), with Karen Gillan playing the part of Shrimpton.

A kosovorotka (), commonly known in the West as a Zhivago shirt, Russian peasant shirt or Tolstoy shirt (tolstovka). The name comes from the Russian phrase kosoy vorot (косой ворот), meaning a “skewed collar”. It was worn by all peasants in Russia — men, women, and babies — in different styles for every-day and festive occasions. Description alt=thumb220x220px Ivashka in a Kosovorotka and Baba Yaga from the fairy tale about three Tsar virgins and about Ivaschka, the priest's son. Ivan Bilibin, 1911 A kosovorotka is a traditional Russian shirt, long sleeved and reaching down to the mid-thigh. The shirt is not buttoned all the way down to the hem, but has several buttons at the collar (unfastened when the garment is pulled over the wearer's head), though these are positioned off to one side (regional styles vary between left and right), instead of centrally, as is customary with a typical Western 20th and 21st century man's shirt. The side slit was to prevent cross pendants that peasants wore under their shirts from falling out when they bent down during active physical labor. If left unbuttoned the collar appears skewed, which accounts for the garment's name. The collar and sleeves of kosovorotka were often decorated with a traditional embroidered ornament. The overwhelming majority of Russians were peasants, who often worked bending down towards the ground. Almost all of them wore a Christian cross, which was considered strictly an underclothing sign. The skewed collar of the shirt was designed so to prevent the cross from falling out from under the shirt. This limited annoyance and allowed for the peasant to be more productive.Members of the Mordvin folk ensemble \\"Torama\\" in the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg carries Kosovorotkas The men's garment was worn loose and was not tucked into the trousers, but instead belted either with a conventional belt, a rope, or a rope-like tie. The tails of the garment hung over the trousers. Women's shirts were tucked into the skirt or worn under the sarafan, and the button line of women's shirts tended to be in the middle, rather than off at the side. Children's shirts were often too long for those who wore them, and was the only piece of clothing on little boys and girls in the ancient times.alt= Generally associated with Russian peasants, the kosovorotka was worn by peasants and townsmen of various social categories into the early 20th century, when it was rapidly displaced as an everyday garment by more efficient and less elaborate clothing after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The garment is also known as a tolstovka, or the Tolstoy-shirt, because the writer Leo Tolstoy customarily wore one in his later years. Since the late 20th century kosovorotkas appear mostly as souvenirs and as scenic garments of Russian folk music, song and dance ensembles. The kosovorotka is also seen worn by Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago in David Lean's 1965 film Doctor Zhivago.

It is a collection of eighteen comedic essays on popular culture. The book cover was designed by Paul Sahre. Overview Klosterman presents his essays as if they were tracks on a CD. Between each essay, or track, is an \\"interlude\\"--a short, entertaining blurb linking the essays. The following essays are included in Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: *1. This Is Emo: Klosterman recounts \\"fake love\\" we are conditioned to pursue, and the false, unbalanced nature of When Harry Met Sally.... *2. Billy Sim: Klosterman describes his experience with the reality-mimicking video game The Sims and how The Sims illustrates that \\"even eternally free people are enslaved by the process of living.\\" *3. What Happens When People Stop Being Polite: The impacts of MTV's The Real World and how it led to the development of one-dimensional personalities. *4. Every Dog Must Have His Every Day, Every Drunk Must Have His Drink: An ode to Billy Joel, particularly the universality of his album Glass Houses. *5. Appetite for Replication: Klosterman interviews and spends a few days with the members of a Guns N' Roses tribute band, \\"Paradise City,\\" and outlines the significance of tribute bands. *6. Ten Seconds to Love: An analysis of how American culture is upset with the unrealistic images of success it has created, as stemming from a discussion of the Pamela-Tommy sex tape. *7. George Will vs. Nick Hornby: A rant against soccer (particularly among youth), claiming it supports outcast culture. *8. 33: Klosterman explains how the 1980s rivalry between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics symbolizes all rivalries in life, including politics, religion, and race. *9. Porn: An explanation of how the Internet has proliferated the porn industry, as per the need of the presence of the amateur and celebrity in our lives. *10. The Lady or the Tiger: A brief history of the cereal industry, and how Kelloggs was begun as a religious company, but now is a microcosm for coolness. The \\"cocoa puffs\\" in the title comes from this essay. *11. Being Zack Morris: An analysis of Saved by the Bell and how \\"important things are inevitably cliché.\\" *12. Sulking with Lisa Loeb on the Ice Planet Hoth: Why Star Wars is so overrated, and how it has come to represent basic morality. *13. The Awe-Inspiring Beauty of Tom Cruise's Shattered, Troll-like Face: A discussion of the question \\"What is reality?\\" as answered by movies such as Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Memento, and Waking Life. *14. Toby over Moby: How the Dixie Chicks are the new Van Halen, as they are one of the only pop bands with musical quality, and how Van Halen's teenage boys have been replaced by the Dixie Chicks' teenage girls. Also how music taste is used to gauge coolness, and those who ignorantly say they like all kinds \\"except country\\" only say so to appear cool. *15. This is Zodiac Speaking: A description of three people Klosterman has interviewed who have known or met serial killers, and an exploration of \\"What does it mean to know a serial killer?\\" *16. All I Know Is What I Read in the Papers: Most of the media's bias is accidental, and stories are mainly developed by circumstance and by the interviewee who calls the journalist back first. Also how sports reporters hate sports, and how newspapers are designed for those who cannot read. *17. I, Rock Chump: Klosterman narrates his visit to the 2002 Pop Music Studies Conference by the Experience Music Project, and how it was largely an experience without rock and roll. *18. How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found: A commentary on the Left Behind Series and the lifestyle of Evangelical Christians. The chapter title refers to the book How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found by Doug Richmond and possibly the song How To Disappear Completely by Radiohead.

Pasteurella species are nonmotile and pleomorphic, and often exhibit bipolar staining (\\"safety pin\\" appearance). Most species are catalase- and oxidase-positive.Health Protection Agency (2007). Identification of Pasteurella species and morphologically similar bacteria (.pdf) . National Standard Method BSOP ID 13 Issue 2.1. The genus is named after the French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, who first identified the bacteria now known as Pasteurella multocida as the agent of chicken cholera. Pathogenesis Many Pasteurella species are zoonotic pathogens, and humans can acquire an infection from domestic animal bites. In cattle, sheep, and birds, Pasteurella species can cause a life-threatening pneumonia; in cats and dogs, however, Pasteurella is not a cause of disease, and constitutes part of the normal flora of the nose and mouth. Pasteurella haemolytica is a species that infects mainly cattle and horses: P. multocida is the most frequent causative agent in human Pasteurella infection. Common symptoms of pasteurellosis in humans include swelling, cellulitis, and bloody drainage at the site of the wound. Infection may progress to nearby joints, where it can cause further swelling, arthritis, and abscesses. Pasteurella spp. are generally susceptible to chloramphenicol, the penicillins, tetracycline, and the macrolides. The common occurrence of the bacteria is a reason to be medically proactive and defensive (antibacterial treatments are often necessary) if a bite occurs. =In animals = P. multocida is also known to cause morbidity and mortality in rabbits. The predominant syndrome is upper respiratory disease. P. multocida can be endemic among rabbit colonies and is often transmitted through nasal secretions. P. multocida can survive several days in water or moist areas. Pasturella can be transmitted through the bite of a dog. =Antibiotic sensitivity= P. multocida is highly sensitive to enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, chloramphinicol, and ampicillin.

Most of the Hamlet is governed by West Haverstraw Village, a small portion of Garnerville defaults to Town of Haverstraw. It received its name from the Garner family which operated a textile printing industry called Garner Printworks on Minisceongo Creek near Railroad Avenue beginning in 1838. East of where the Garner printworks operated is the abandoned Calico Hill Cemetery. The community is bisected by U.S. Route 202. The Town of Haverstraw Town Hall is located in the hamlet, along with several small shopping centers and the newly renovated King's Daughters Library. The schools in Garnerville include North Garnerville Elementary School and St. Gregory Barbarigo Parochial School; the village is part of the North Rockland Central School District. Rockland Community College symbolically recognized David J. Rojas of Garnerville as State University of New York (SUNY) “millionth graduate” at the 46th Commencement Ceremony held on June 3, 2007. History Garner Print Works Around 1760, Cornelius Osborn built a grist mill at a waterfall on the Minisceongo Creek; this later became the site of the Calico Works. In 1828, a rolling mill and a nail factory were established a bit upstream on the site of a former grist mill by John I. and George Suffern. From 1850 to 1858, John I. Suffern manufactured coarse wrapping paper at that location.Green, Frank Bertangue. \\"Garnerville\\", The History of Rockland County, A.S. Barnes, 1886, pp. 386-387 Also in 1828, Scotsman John Glass purchased forty-five acres south of the Minisceongo for a calico print works. On June 7, 1831, Glass was loading goods to be shipped to New York City on board the General Jackson, docked at Grassy Point, New York. The steamboat's boiler exploded, killing fourteen people, including Glass. In 1838 the property was purchased by James and Thomas Garner and Charles Wells. The Garner print works prospered, buildings were enlarged and extended. The works employed about 800 people, and a village sprang up around the factory, and called \\"Garnerville\\". In 1853 the Rockland Print Works Company was incorporated for the purpose of \\"Printing and Dyeing Woolen, Cotton, and Linen Goods. During the Civil War, the Rockland Print Works made uniforms for the Union Army. The Garnerville Railroad was a spur that ran from the print works to the New Jersey and New York Railroad at Miner's Creek.Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of New York for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1902', Part 2, Weed, Parsons and Company, 1903, p. 630 In 1840, Resolve Waldron and Charles Benson established a chemical factory for the manufacture of pyroligneous acid, much used in calico printing. The business closed in 1843, but was revived the following year by William Knight at a location near Cedar Pond. The Garnerville Post Office was established in June 1875; John D.

He had major roles in two films directed by Jean Renoir, Grand Illusion (1937) and The Rules of the Game (1939).  Life and career Early life in France= Dalio was born Israel Moshe Blauschild in Paris to Romanian-Jewish immigrant parents.Tablet Magazine: \\"The Brothers Who Co-Wrote ‘Casablanca’ - Writers Julius and Philip Epstein are also forebears of baseball’s Theo Epstein\\" by Adam Chandler August 22, 2013 He trained at the Paris Conservatoire and performed in revues from 1920. Dalio appeared in stage plays from the 1920s and acted in French films in the 1930s. His first big film success was in Julien Duvivier's Pépé le Moko (1937). He followed them with two films for Jean Renoir, La Grande Illusion (1937) and The Rules of the Game (La Règle du jeu, 1939). After divorcing his first wife, Jany Holt, he married the young actress Madeleine Lebeau in 1939. =Wartime exile= In June 1940, Dalio and Lebeau left Paris ahead of the invading German army and reached Lisbon. They are presumed to have received transit visas from Aristides de Sousa Mendes, allowing them to enter Spain and journey on to Portugal. It took them two months to get visas to Chile. However, when their ship, the S.S. Quanza, stopped in Mexico, they were stranded (along with around 200 other passengers) when the Chilean visas they had purchased turned out to be forgeries. Eventually they were able to get temporary Canadian passports and entered the United States. Meanwhile, the advancing German Nazi army in occupied France used posters of his face as a representative of \\"a typical Jew\\". All other members of Dalio's family died in Nazi concentration camps. In Hollywood, although Dalio was never quite able to regain the profile he had in France, he appeared in 19 American films during the Second World War, in stereotypical roles as a Frenchman. Dalio's first film in the United States was the Fred MacMurray comedy One Night in Lisbon (1941) in which he portrayed a hotel concierge. Around the same time, he appeared in the Edward G. Robinson film Unholy Nights and the Gene Tierney film The Shanghai Gesture (also 1941). He remained busy, appearing in Flight Lieutenant (1942) starring Pat O'Brien and Glenn Ford. Dalio next portrayed a Frenchman, Focquet, in the film The Pied Piper (also 1942). In this film, Monty Woolley portrayed an Englishman trying to get out of France with an ever-increasing number of children ahead of the German invasion. Dalio then appeared among the star-studded cast in Tales of Manhattan (both 1942). In the uncredited role of Emil the croupier in Casablanca (also 1942), he appeared in the scene when Captain Renault closes down Rick's Cafe American using the pretext, \\"I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\\", Emil approaches him and hands him his usual bribe money saying, \\"Your winnings sir.\\", while Rick darts Emile a flabbergasted look. His wife Madeleine Lebeau was also in the film, playing Yvonne, Rick's intermittent girlfriend. On 22 June, while Lebeau was filming her scenes with Hans Twardowski as the German officer, Dalio filed for divorce in Los Angeles on the grounds of desertion. Lauren Bacall, Marcel Dalio and Humphrey Bogart in To Have and Have Not (1944) He was cast in some larger roles, for example in the war dramas Tonight We Raid Calais and Paris After Dark (both 1943), in the latter his ex-wife Lebeau also appeared. Dalio played a French policeman in The Song of Bernadette (also 1943). His penultimate wartime role in an American film was in the adaptation of To Have and Have Not (1944) reuniting him with Humphrey Bogart. =Postwar= When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, Dalio returned to France to continue his movie career. His first appearance that year was in Her Final Role (Son dernier rôle, 1946). He appeared in ten more movies in France and one in England through the late 1940s. He played Captain Nikarescu in Black Jack (1950). Dalio appeared in four American movies in the mid-1950s. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes starring Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe and Flight to Tangier (both 1953) starring Joan Fontaine, Lucky Me starring Doris Day and Sabrina (both 1954) starring Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. In Sabrina, the bearded Dalio played one of Hepburn's fellow cooking students in Paris. He then briefly returned to France. Dalio portrayed the Claude Rains character, Captain Renault, in the short-lived television series Casablanca (1955). Dalio had the role of a French sergeant in the war drama Jump into Hell (also 1955) about the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam. Dalio appeared in the musical comedy Ten Thousand Bedrooms starring Dean Martin, with Paul Henreid in the supporting cast. He also appeared as a French priest in a war movie, again about the French involvement in Vietnam, called China Gate which features the acting of Nat King Cole. Finally that year, Dalio played Zizi in The Sun Also Rises (all 1957) his third movie based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, this time starring Tyrone Power and Ava Gardner. Over the next four years, he appeared in Lafayette Escadrille, The Perfect Furlough (both 1958) starring Tony Curtis, The Man Who Understood Women starring Henry Fonda, Pillow Talk (both 1959) starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day, Can-Can (1960) starring Frank Sinatra and The Devil at 4 O'Clock (1961) starring Sinatra and Spencer Tracy. After making more movies in France, Dalio received a major supporting role in the mystery The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), set entirely in England but filmed primarily in Hollywood. Two of Dalio's previous co-stars, Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra, had cameos in the film. This was followed with the part of Father Cluzeot in the John Wayne movie, Donovan's Reef (also 1963). After appearing again with Tony Curtis in Wild and Wonderful (1964), Dalio returned to France. He continued making movies for Hollywood, but he also appeared in many French productions. Later movies featuring Dalio include Lady L (1965) starring Sophia Loren and Paul Newman, How to Steal a Million (1966) starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole and How Sweet It Is! (1968) starring Debbie Reynolds and James Garner. In Mike Nichols' Catch-22 Dalio played the old Italian living in the whorehouse, while he also appeared in The Great White Hope (both 1970) with James Earl Jones. From then on, he did movies almost entirely in France, the best known of them being The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob (1973) and La Bête (1975) directed by Walerian Borowczyk. His last appearance was in a TV movie portraying Lord Exeter in Les Longuelune (1982). = Television = Dalio also appeared in numerous television shows both in the United States (between 1954 and 1963) and in France (1968 to 1981). These include guest appearances in Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Peter Gunn, 77 Sunset Strip, Maverick (in \\"Game of Chance\\" with James Garner and Jack Kelly), Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond and Ben Casey. Dalio married Hollywood based French journalist Madeleine [Alena] Prime in Los Angeles, in 1981. Dalio, who appeared in almost 150 movies, died in Paris on 18 November 1983 at the age of 83. He is buried in Cimetière parisien de Montrouge in Hauts de Seine, France.

It was released in June 1995 as a collectible card game (CCG), but was shifted to a fixed distribution of cards as of 2013. It shares the same background as the Feng Shui role- playing game, also by Laws and Garcia and released the following year. In September 2018 ownership of Shadowfist switched to Vetusta Games. Overview Shadowfist is a multi-player asymmetrical strategic game, the design of which is influenced by games such as Cosmic Encounter, Dune by Avalon Hill, Magic: The Gathering and its direct predecessor, On the Edge. Shadowfist is primarily inspired by Hong Kong action cinema and wuxia films of the late 1980s and 1990s, and by action films in general. In the game, various factions from across time battle for control of the world's Feng Shui sites in a conflict known as the \\"Secret War.\\" Time travel takes place through an alternate dimension known as the Netherworld which opens to various time junctures. The current open junctures are AD 86, 1867, and 2013. The pulp (1942) and future (2072) junctures were closed with the 2013 Combat in Kowloon release. Unlike Feng Shui, Shadowfist's time junctures move forward as time actually progresses, permitting new game releases to reflect the present. The titles of cards and the flavor text in the game are rife with humor and pop culture references, especially the Jammers faction, which contains cards such as \\"Furious George\\" and \\"Entropy is your Friend.\\" Publication History Shadowfist was originally published as a CCG by Daedalus Entertainment until they went out of business in 1996. The license was acquired by Zev Shlasinger in 2000; Shlasinger had primarily established his game company, Z-Man Games, to bring Shadowfist back. Z-Man Games released ten new sets over the next five years, before moving on to other projects. The next year a group of fans formed Shadowfist Games to continue publishing sets. This group worked with Shlasinger to publish the next three sets between 2006 and 2009. Shadowfist remained a CCG, with randomized distribution of cards within decks or packs, from its inception through the last Shadowfist Games set in 2009. No new sets were then published, until 2013. The game is now being published by Inner Kingdom Games, founded by Daniel Griego and Braz King, but currently managed solely by Griego. The card set that would become Combat in Kowloon and Back for Seconds (in January 2013) was originally slated to be a single booster pack release using the long-standing CCG model. It carried the working title \\"Hong Kong 2010\\" from its design and development in 2009 through play-testing in 2010 and art design in early 2011. In 2011, Inner Kingdom Games re- published the award-winning Seven Masters vs. the Underworld expansion. After only moderate success with this release, Inner Kingdom Games switched Shadowfist from the CCG model to the fixed distribution Dynamic Card Game (DCG) model. The DCG model was directly inspired by the Living Card Game (LCG) model used by several other card games, many of which also transitioned from the CCG model. To fund new sets, Inner Kingdom Games conducted a Kickstarter campaign in August 2012 that exceeded the required funding targets. Inner Kingdom Games broke up “Hong Kong 2010” into two separate releases (\\"Combat in Kowloon\\" and \\"Back for Seconds\\"), and published them beginning in January 2013. Following the release of Combat in Kowloon and Back for Seconds, 2013 saw the release of the first expansion block in the DCG model. Dubbed the \\"Rebirth Cycle\\" It included the decks, \\"Reloaded\\", \\"Reinforcements\\", and \\"Revelations\\". Reloaded is composed primarily of reprinted cards deemed necessary for the new environment. Included with these were nine new cards and updates to seven previously printed cards. Reinforcements and Revelations included 50 never before seen cards each. Included in this release was the first Action Pack, a 50 card pack of cards from the expansion that players would want more of for their decks. An acknowledgement that a flat distribution wouldn't fulfill the needs for some cards that would have been more common in the CCG model. A second Kickstarter campaign saw release of the Coming Darkness block in 2014 with three sets, Queens Gambit (the lack of apostrophe was purposeful), Knight's Passage, and Endgame. A second Action Pack was released in the same model as the previous one. 2015 saw a third Kickstarter, this time for a starter Expansion, Year of the Goat with each of the six remaining factions receiving a pre-constructed starter. Basic Story The world of Shadowfist follows the background of the Feng Shui role playing game, where the art of Chinese geomancy, or Feng Shui, is real. Thus, control of this world does not depend on military might or political pull but on control of major Feng Shui sites. These are in-game locations that channel the greatest amount of Chi, the energy of life. Having more personal Chi than your opposition causes \\"everything goes your way\\", statistically speaking. With enough Chi, characters can see and use portals to the Netherworld, an alternate dimension that connects the various junctions in time. These characters are generally aligned with one of several warring factions, and. each game of Shadowfist represents one battle in this ‘secret war’. Each battle contributes to the story, since controlling enough sites in a past juncture would allow a faction to take control of the planet and dramatically alter all subsequent junctures. Of course, those who already control the past and the future are all trying to do the same. Game play Players create a deck of cards (typically 40-80 total) and draw blind from a randomized stack, playing cards when possible and discarding unneeded cards. Card types include: Sites, Characters, Events, Edges and States. Sites are considered locations that stay in play permanently until removed or destroyed. Characters are used to attack and defend locations or other characters or generate effects and stay in play until 'smoked' or 'toasted', Events are played at any time and generate a specific effect and are then discarded. Edges are permanent cards that generate effects. States are played on other card in order to modify them or provide an additional effect. The goal of Shadowfist is to accumulate five Feng Shui sites (or six in a two-player game). These can be played from a player's hand or taken from other players. However, in order to win the game, a player's final Feng Shui site must be taken from another player. Attacking and attacking to win the game are very different events during the game. The former might only draw a response from the defending player while the latter will certainly draw a response from all the other players in the game. Players must meet both the power cost and resource requirements of a card to play it. Power represents a player's assets (money, firepower, chutzpah, etc.) and is primarily generated by players’ sites at the beginning of their turn. Resources represent either a faction's increasing involvement in the conflict or additional access to one of three talents (Tech, Magic, and Chi). Resources are typically provided by players’ characters. Spent power is taken from the player's power pool but resources remain available, even after characters are killed off in game. Shadowfist uses a \\"last in, first out\\" or LIFO system for resolving effects. When an effect is generated by the playing of a card or from the rules text of a card in play, a new scene begins and players can generally respond with new effects. After the final new effect in the scene is generated, they begin to resolve beginning with the newest effect and ending with the oldest. Shadowfist, released in 1995, differs from its CCG contemporaries in that focuses on multi-player gameplay rather than dueling. A key factor in Shadowfist gameplay is that players must team together to stop the player who is poised to win the game. All players can play cards that affect any other player's cards, even if they are not directly involved in attacking or being attacked. One of the most important skills in the game is judging when and how to use resources for defense against other players in lieu of attacking power. One of the other major differences between Shadowfist and other CCGs in multi-player is the fluidity of the game: players are never removed from the game and can often recover quickly from even the most crushing defeat. Factions There have been up to ten factions involved in the secret war: *The Eaters of the Lotus are a cabal of evil eunuch sorcerers from ancient China who have usurped power in the Imperial court using black magic and demons. *The Architects of the Flesh are scientists from the future who figured out how to combine magic and technology into a perverse new form of science called Arcanotechnology, which they use to convert captured demons into creatures known as abominations. The Architects formerly controlled the future, but a civil war split them in half, and then a critical shift in 1934 essentially wiped them out of the timestream. The faction's two halves have now been split across the time-stream: The BuroMil, the military arm led by Johann Bonengel has taken over Nazi Germany from within, while the CDCA, the research division headed by Dr. Curtis Boatman, heads a multinational corporation in 2072. In the game, their home juncture was first radically changed by the critical shift, and then subsequently closed. *The Dragons are a rag-tag collection of mavericks and heroes from across time who've banded together to fight against evil and tyranny in the name of freedom and justice. Their success in the 1930s, in the Pulp juncture (1942—in conjunction with the Purists' major failure) caused the most recent 'critical shift' and made their de facto leader, Zheng Yi Quan, the new master of the modern world. With his disappearance, the Dragon's tenuous hold on the Modern juncture has been weakening. *The Guiding Hand are a secret society composed of monks, revolutionaries, and martial artists led by the Perfect Master Quan Lo who seek to drive all foreign influences out of China in 1866 and extend their vision of a world based on Neo-Confucianism principles across time. *The Ascended are animals who achieved human form long ago and who once controlled the world both in AD 1866 and 2012 from the heart of a vast conspiracy. They still have control of the 1866 juncture, but have lost much of their power and influence in 2012 following the 'critical shift' in 1942. *The Jammers are a loose organization of rebels, malcontents, anarchists, and cyborg monkeys. Originally a rebel group in opposition to the Architects of the Flesh, they believe that the only way to free humanity from tyranny and oppression is through the destruction of every feng shui site in existence. They operate primarily out of the Netherworld. With the release of the Year of the Goat expansion, the portals to the Future juncture have reopened with the Jammers in control. *The Four Monarchs were two brothers and two sisters of incredible magical might who once ruled the modern world in an alternate timeline. Their version of reality was erased by the Ascended, forcing them into exile in the Netherworld. With the defection of their sister, Ming I to the Eaters of the Lotus (in the Coming Darkness cycle), the faction is now referred to as \\"The Monarchs\\". *The Seven Masters are a group of legendary warrior-monks who live in isolation and practice a philosophy of non- intervention, except in the most dire of situations. They appear to be based in the AD 85 juncture. *The Purists began as Lotus infiltrators of the Architects sent to study that faction's Arcanotechnology and, being unbound by Lotus traditions, developed a radical new \\"pure\\" and math-based sorcery known as Paradox Magic. Having recently lost their stronghold in the future, they've quietly re-established themselves in 1942. *The Syndicate is a secretive organization which rules the world in 2072 through control of all the major criminal organizations and corporations. They came into existence after the critical shift in 1942 that erased the Architects' version of reality. In game, this juncture has been closed. Set History * 1995 - Release of the first Shadowfist 'Limited' set. Consisted of randomly packed 60-card starter decks and 13-card booster packs. This set was printed by Upper Deck and boosters have fancy foil packaging. Included the original five factions: Architects, Ascended, Dragons, Hand, and Lotus, and a few cards from the Four Monarchs and Jammers. These cards bear a gold foil Ting Ting (a popular card from the Dragons faction) logo in the upper right hand corner. * Late 1995 - Shadowfist 'Standard' set. Identical to the Limited run, except for certain Unique characters that were said to have \\"died\\" (though some copies of these cards made it into Standard boxes anyway). Cards from this set bear no foil stamp or other set logo. So many Limited and Standard cards were printed that they are relatively easy to find online today. * 1996 - Netherworld. This booster-only set included cards from the first five factions and also fleshed out the Monarchs and Jammers, though they would remain the less well-rounded of the seven. These cards also bear the gold foil Ting Ting logo. Netherworld boxes are practically extinct. * 1996 - Flashpoint. Another booster set, with a focus on the Architects and Dragons (though still including cards for all seven factions). Cards from this set bear a gold foil rifle logo. Flashpoint had a very annoying rarity distribution scheme and was the last expansion printed by Daedalus. Boxes of Flashpoint can still be found online with relative ease. * 2000 - Year of the Dragon. This set marked the beginning of the Z-Man Games era and consisted of a brand new set of 50-card fixed starters, one for each of the original five factions. Many of these were Daedalus reprints but the starters also included quite a few new cards. YotD cards bear a white, non-foil, dragon's-head-in-profile logo. * 2000 - Throne War. Booster-only. It was originally scheduled for an October 1996 release. Focused heavily on the Lotus, who got 1/4 of the cards in the set, bringing them into line with the power level of the other four original factions. Throne War cards bear a white pagoda logo. * 2001 - Netherworld II: Back Through The Portals. This booster expansion focused on the Monarchs, who got 1/3 of the cards in the set. Despite this their power level would remain a bit below the other factions until later. N2 cards have a black-and-white vortex logo. * 2001 - Shaolin Showdown. The cards in this booster expansion focused somewhat on the Ascended and Hand. This set generated some complaints about low power level, but still included quite a few important cards. SS cards have a white crossed-swords logo. * 2002 - Dark Future. This booster expansion introduced the Purists as a new faction and also emphasized the Architects. Boxes of DF are now hard to find because they contain most of the foundation cards for the Purists; without foundations they are, of course, hard to play. Dark Future cards have a three-diamond logo that is white, gray, or black if the card is rare, uncommon, or common, respectively. (This rarity color-coding has continued in every booster expansion since.) This set was reprinted with the release of Critical Shift in July 2007. * 2002 - Boom Chaka Laka. A small (91-card) booster expansion that generated some controversy based on its '70s theme. BCL had a very short print run. Cards from this expansion have a nunchuks logo. * 2002 - 10,000 Bullets. A fixed 50-card starter expansion with one deck for each of the eight factions. 10kB cards have a row-of-bullets logo that is overlaid with the faction symbol of the deck it came from. There is no rarity coding since all the cards are fixed. * 2003 - Red Wedding. Generally held to be the best booster expansion to date for reasons of playability, balance, and art. Naturally, RW sold out quickly; another, smaller run was reprinted in 2006. Red Wedding cards have a knife-through-the-heart logo. * 2004 - Seven Masters vs. the Underworld. This booster expansion introduced the Seven Masters mini-faction, bringing the faction total to nine. 7M cards have a scroll logo. This release won the 2004 Origins award for best Collectible Card Game (2005). By popular demand, this set was re-released in 2011. * 2004 - Two-Fisted Tales of the Secret War. Another 'themed' booster expansion, this time based on pulp fiction; gave fairly equal weight to the first eight factions. Last of the Z-Man Games expansions. 2FT cards have a 'dime' logo. * 2006 - Shurikens & Six-Guns. This booster expansion is the first to be printed by Shadowfist Games. It, too, is themed, based on Westerns, and introduces the Syndicate faction. SSG cards have a US Marshal's badge logo. * 2007 - Critical Shift. The second Shadowfist Games set's storyline focuses on the aftermath of the most recent Critical Shift. Both this set and the previous set were designed to be \\"draft-friendly\\" by including more Feng Shui sites and new foundation characters for most factions. The symbol for the set is a figure with arrows pointing to a parallel figure. * 2009 - Empire of Evil. The final Shadowfist Games booster set. The storyline focuses on a bid for mastery by the new leadership of the Eaters of the Lotus by the way of an infernal marriage. The symbol is a standard with a crowned skull. * 2013 - Combat in Kowloon. This first original release from Inner Kingdom Games (IKG) transitions the game from a CCG to a customizable, non-collectible format (Dynamic Card Game). It features a starter deck of 50 cards for each of four factions, the Ascended, the Dragons, the Eaters of the Lotus and the Guiding Hand. The set symbol is an eight-sided feng shui mirror. * 2013 - Back for Seconds. This second release by IKG features two expansion decks for Combat in Kowloon. It introduces the Monarchs and the Jammers into the DCG format. This set features the same feng shui mirror for its symbol. * 2013 - Reloaded - This third release by IKG is the first true expansion for the DCG format. It adds 50 new cards (including reprints) in a 50 card Shadowpack. This set has a pistol silhouette for its symbol. Rebirth Cycle - The storyline for this block features the departure of The Queen of the Darkness Pagoda from the faction \\"The Four Monarchs\\" and joining the faction, \\"The Eaters of the Lotus\\". * 2013 - Reinforcements - This fourth release by IKG adds 50 all new cards in a 50 card Shadowpack. This set has a black-bordered shield with a red field and a white outline for its symbol. * 2013 - Revelations - The fifth release by IKG adds 50 all new cards in a 50 card Shadowpack. This set has a seven petaled white lotus flower in profile outlined in black for its symbol. * 2013 - Action Pack 1 - This 50 card set consists of reprints from the 2013 releases of cards that would normally fill the 'common' slot in a standard CCG release. The cards in this pack retain the symbol of the set in which they were originally released. Coming Darkness Cycle - The storyline follows a grand scheme by Ming I to supplant Xin Ji Yang on the Dragon Throne by setting a trap for her in the Modern Juncture. * 2014 - Queens Gambit - This release is a set of 50 new cards. Its symbol is a black queen chess piece within a grey circle. * 2014 - Knight's Passage - This release is a set of 50 new cards. Its symbol is a black knight chess piece within a grey circle. * 2014 - Endgame - This release is a set of 50 new cards. Its symbol is a black rook (castle) chess piece within a grey circle. * 2014 - Action Pack 2 - This 50 card set consists of reprints from the Coming Darkness Cycle in the same fashion as the 2013 Action Pack. The cards retain their original set symbol. * 2015 - Year of the Goat - This set consists of 6 faction-specific decks of 55 cards each with a total of 157 new cards. The symbol for this set is a hand- drawn goat face, the color matching the faction color to easily identify which deck it came from. The future Continuing with the Dynamic Card Game (DCG) model, Inner Kingdom Games is settling into a pattern of a Starter set block, followed by two expansion blocks of three decks each. The first expansion after the Year of the Goat expansion is under the working title of \\"A Better Tomorrow\\" and will focus on the newly reopened Future juncture. The Story so Far... Each set has some back-story involved, which often is shown via the card names and their flavor text (the italicized non-rules text on the cards). There is often fiction posted which fleshes out the story. *Limited/Standard: The major plot involved the Ascended's Operation Killdeer which led to the deaths of Adrienne Hart, Jack Donovan, Mad Dog McCroun, Jueding Shelun, and the Thing with 1000 Tongues (a disgusting demon). Collateral damage in the meleé were Sun Chen and Nirmal Yadav. Iala Mané, another combatant was presumed dead. *Netherworld: Following up to the story in Limited, the action takes place around the alliance of the Monarchs, Ascended and Jammers leading to the creation (and otherwise destruction of) the Molten Heart. *Flashpoint: The plotline centered around the Architects of the Flesh creation of the Arcanotower, an organic structure which was seeded in modern-day South America which, when fully grown will create a Critical Shift. *To this point... Starting with the storyline of Critical Shift and following through Empire of Evil, the doomsday prophecy of the Syndicate came true. No one's sure what happened, but the end result is the closing of the portals to the 2063 juncture. This leaves the future(!) of the Architects of the Flesh, Purists and Syndicate up in the air. *Combat in Kowloon/Back for Seconds: The fiction for this set is in review at this time. Reception Andy Butcher reviewed Shadowfist for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"In all,Shadowfist is an impressive achievement. It's not only a superb card game, but it's also a great introduction to a new and imaginative game world.\\" Andy Butcher reviewed the Netherworld expansion set for Shadowfist for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that \\"As with all expansion sets, Netherworld increases the complexity of the game, but otherwise there's precious little to criticise. Shadowfist was one of the best card games to be released last year, and Netherworld just makes it even better.\\" Ken St. Andre comments: \\"A game of Shadowfist is more than card against card. It's guile against guile. And don't we all want to be the mastermind who controls both Time and Fortune?\\" Reviews *Pyramid #17 (Jan./Feb., 1996)http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=4458 References http://netherworld.chimpshack.org/sf_story_op_killdeer.html http://netherworld.chimpshack.org/sf_sets_nw.html#story http://netherworld.chimpshack.org/sf_sets_fp.html#story External links *Home page *The ChimpShack Searchable Card Database Category:Card games introduced in 1995 Category:Collectible card games Category:Multiplayer games Category:Robin Laws games ","title":"Shadowfist"},{"id":"2492395","text":"In telecommunication, Open fiber control is a protocol to ensure that both ends of a fiber optic cable are connected before laser signals are transmitted in order to protect people from eye damage.

Shashanka Ghosh, the creative driver behind the launch of MTV and Channel V in India, marks his debut as a director with this film.http://waisabhihotahai.indiatimes.com/cast.htm Shashanka Ghosh Running in many parallel threads, it is in equal parts a comedy, satire, crime, and a Hindi masala film. The film is popular for its songs \\"Allah ke Bande\\" performed by Kailash Kher and \\"Sajna Aa Bhi Jaa\\" performed by Shibani Kashyap.  Plot  Puneet Sayal (Arshad Warsi) is a copywriter with a dream: to earn enough cash to dump his job and live peacefully in Nainital. Till the said dream materialises however, he's living in Bombay with his girlfriend Agni (Sandhya Mridul). Things go asunder one day when he finds out his brother's been shot dead — a brother he's hardly acknowledged in the past. Agni finds out and, following an argument, throws him out of the house. Puneet goes on a drinking spree that leads him to a park bench where he witnesses someone being shot. He doesn't know it yet, but this is the end of his life as he knows it. He saves the injured man — a gangster called Vishnu (Prashant Narayanan) — and the act lands him squarely in the middle of Bombay's famed gang wars. The war between ganglords Ganpat (Anant Jog) and Gangu (Pratima Kazmi) is a second thread in the film. Ganpat is the dominant kingpin, and Gangu is the perpetual second-in-place who's never given up her dreams of displacing Ganpat as top don.

Les Podervianskyi (, ; born 1952 in Kiev) is a Ukrainian painter, poet, playwright and performer. He is most famous for his absurd, highly satirical, and at times obscene short plays. Their average duration is five to fifteen minutes, with some exceptions. Podervianskyi has a cult following among Kiev intellectuals.  Cultural background  Les Podervianskyi in anarchist suit at an underground art festival in Huliaipole. 24 August 2006. In 1968 he graduated from the Republican Art School in Kiev. In 1976 he graduated from the Kiev Art Institute (specialty: easel and monumental painting, graphics, theatrical painting). Podervianskyi wrote most of his works in the Soviet Union in the mid to late 1980s, a time of stagnation in politics and social life—the of era of \\"zastoy\\" and the time of rapid changes in consciousness. He observed the people in that situation, their reactions and behaviour. And most thoroughly he watched the speech patterns of outsiders and commoners, people from the country. The author places common people in grotesque absurd situations and shows how they would act and speak much the same regardless of what happens. Podervianskyi's works are highly regarded owing to his attention to detail. Many behavioural modes are easily recognizable, and people are able to recognize themselves in the plays. The general absurdity of the situation makes the characters' absurd actions more acceptable, and although certain phrases the author uses are politically incorrect, his humour is generally neutral. Podervianskyi says he draws a lot of his inspiration from the years of his army service. There is also an opinion that his plays are in some way inspired by works of Samuel Beckett. This writer was favorite also for his friend artist Nicholas Zalevsky. Member of the Union of Artists of Ukraine since 1980.  Language  Podervianskyi's works have often been criticized because of his use of vulgar unprintable language. They are written mostly in Surzhyk and include much swearing and obscenities, which make them appear as if they were composed by an uneducated person. Often it seems that the only reason one would read the works is for their comic impact and to hear creative swearing. But this is not the case. The numerous citations from Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Taoism and dzen buddhism philosophers give the idea of several intellectual layers in his works. Although a number of Podervianskyi's expressions have entered Ukrainian slang, he uses crude language to show the flaws and grotesqueness of his characters. Podervianskyi carefully matches up language with his characters. Thus a self-made intellectual spouts scientific-sounding nonsense, while more \\"straightforward\\" characters use simple words to express complex things. Because Podervianskyi's works are known primarily in the form of audio recordings of the author's recitals, his voice adds extra dramatic effect to the text.

A bored and indifferent hero doesn't care about religion, revenge, truth, or politics; all he wants is to get drunk. Eventually he kills everyone, including his father, and he is taken to an asylum by a famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud. = Pavlik Morozov = A longer (one-hour) play set in the Siberian taiga, where a group of members of the Soviet youth Pioneer Movement is led by a Communist official in search of God in order to prove (by not finding God) that God does not exist. Things rapidly change when God's messenger Mykola Ostrovsky (a reference to Soviet writer Nikolai Ostrovsky), is found in the process. The result of rapid change from atheism to paganism is minimal in terms of human behaviour. The name of the play refers to pioneer Pavlik Morozov, a young Soviet communist \\"martyr\\". = Pizdets = (Devoted to artists unions) A group of passive art-men live in a freight car, eat state-supplied noodles every day, and do absolutely nothing except pseudo-intellectual chat. They are completely happy inside because they are guaranteed their supply of noodles. They are too scared to leave the car for fear of losing their daily meal. On the contrary, local passers-by (non- art-men) are extremely intrigued by what is happening inside, and seek whatever ways to get into the community. In the end, car brakes are removed, it rolls and crashes offscene. = Katsapy = Four Russian tourists enjoy the seaside in mid-level resort city (possibly Feodosiya), speaking with heavy Moscovite pronunciation (known as akanye). Four Ukrainian natives are approaching the city by train, speaking in Surzhyk and discussing various things, events and nations with equal enmity. As train arrives to the destination in the last act, the Ukrainians meet Russians and proceed to attack them. As said at , the train described was the suburban one heading from Vladislavovka back to Feodosiya. Katsaps were pictured being in Novyi Svit (everything of that is in Crimea). Katsapy (sing. Katsap) is a Ukrainian pejorative name for ethnic Russians. = Danko = This play is one of the shortest and at the same time one of the most often referred to and cited in unofficial communication and in public critical literature and media discourse. Its plot is a parody of a classical play by a Soviet writer Maksim Gorky, an idyllic myth of totalitarian Communist ideology. In Gorky's play a hero named Danko leads poor people to the light and happiness through hardships and darkness, burns his own heart to show them the way and dies after this self-sacrifice. Les Podervianskyi's Danko is a rather strange and pathetic fellow, he is also leading a mob of people somewhere but he does not know the way and as he is afraid that people would be angry with his poor directions he burns his heart first, then his liver and finally his kidneys. He dies without any sense and is forgotten by the mob at once.

All three incarnations of Black Condor have been members of the Freedom Fighters and each has been featured in Freedom Fighters comic books published by DC Comics. The first Black Condor, Richard Grey Jr., was created by Quality Comics writer Will Eisner and artist Lou Fine. He first appeared in Crack Comics #1 (May 1940), and continued through issue #31 (Oct 1943). He also appeared in Uncle Sam Quarterly #2 (Dec 1941). He moved to the DC universe when DC Comics bought the rights to Quality Comics characters. The first Black Condor was a World War II era super hero along with the rest of the Freedom Fighters. The second Black Condor, Ryan Kendall, gained the power of flight due to genetic manipulation and initially did not believe he was a super hero. He would later join the Freedom Fighters, but was killed at the beginning of the Infinite Crisis storyline. The third Black Condor, John Trujillo, is of Mayan descent and was given his powers by the Mayan Spider Goddess Tocotl. Seeing himself as a protector of the universe, he joins forces with the Freedom Fighters. Fictional character biographyRichard Grey Jr.=Quality Comics Crack Comics #26, art by Gill Fox A Golden Age superhero who possessed the power of flight, the Black Condor was created by writer Will Eisner under the pseudonym Kenneth Lewis, and artist Lou Fine in Crack Comics #1 (cover-dated May 1940).Crack Comics #1 at the Grand Comics Database. Initially alternating with the Clock as the cover-featured character, he became the solo cover feature from issues #20-26 (Jan.-Nov. 1942). Fine drew the first 24 stories, and his feature continued to run through issue #31.Crack Comics (Quality Comics, 1940 Series) at the Grand Comics Database As an infant traveling with his parents on an archaeological expedition thorough Outer Mongolia, Richard Grey Jr. survived after his family was killed by the bandit Gali Kan and his men. Rescued by a condor who raised him as her own, he learned to fly, as the origin story stated, by \\"studying the movement of wings, the body motions, air currents, balance and levitation\\" of his avian siblings. A mountain hermit, Father Pierre, eventually discovered and civilized the feral child, and taught him to speak English. Richard tracked down and killed the Mongolian bandits who had killed his parents and then departed for the United States where he uncovered a plot to kill United States Senator Thomas Wright. He was too late to save Wright from assassination, and so began to use his identity.The Black Condor at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 27, 2015. He adopted the guise of Black Condor to fight crooked politicians, rum-running bootleggers, and racketeers. The strip was popular, and became Crack Comics' featured story starting in issue #3. In American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944, Kurt Mitchell writes: \\"The Asian backdrop was deemphasized by the end of the year in favor of urban settings or ornately rendered lost cities, bandits and jewel thieves giving ground to mad scientists, living statues, and sentient weapons of mass destruction. Scene after scene of the Condor in flight, his lithe figure soaring across backgrounds seen from dizzying perspectives with a grace Joe Shuster's barrel-chested Superman could not hope to match, made the series irresistible\\". According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Black Condor fights femmes fatale, the Eagle Battalion, Yellow Perils, Kite-Men (Japanese agents on flying kites), a Chinese mad scientist, a golem, and killer robots known as the Spinning Deaths\\". DC Comics In the DC Universe, his power was retconned to being caused by exposure to a radioactive meteor (a story which was slightly touched upon in his Quality origin). Here he met Uncle Sam and joined his group, the Freedom Fighters, and later the All-Star Squadron. He was among a group of Golden and Silver Age heroes who helped the JLA repel an Appellaxian invasion in the JLA: Year One miniseries by Mark Waid. He appeared more recently as an ethereal \\"spirit guide\\" in the pages of Ryan Kendall's Black Condor series. =Ryan Kendall= Black Condor #1, cover by Rags Morales.Black Condor #1 at the Grand Comics Database The second Black Condor, Ryan Kendall, derived his powers of flight, telekinesis, and healing from the genetic experiments of his grandfather, Creighton. A member of an organization called the Society of the Golden Wing, Creighton and his allies had been attempting to create a man who could fly. After numerous attempts, Kendall was the only success. Kendall eventually rebelled and escaped from his grandfather, who made frequent attempts to recapture the youth in order to study and reproduce his abilities. A mysterious telekinetic who kept to himself, Ryan Kendall was adamant when he first appeared as the Black Condor that he was not a superhero. However, time proved him wrong, and he fought alongside other superheroes, notably Primal Force and Justice League International (for a brief time). Eventually, he went to Opal City, where he felt very much at home. In his solo adventures, Kendall sought out Hawkman in hopes of gaining insight into the role of a superhero. He helps in his battle against Karen Ramis, the Post-Zero Hour Lion-Mane.Hawkman (vol. 3) #20 In Infinite Crisis #1, Kendall, as part of the Freedom Fighters, was killed by a powerful beam fired by Sinestro in an ambush by the Secret Society of Super Villains. In Nightwing #140, a mystery villain, Creighton Kendall, who gave him his powers, resurfaces in an attempt to resurrect his evil Golden Wing Society, an organization that would dispense \\"justice\\" from the skies. In the Blackest Night crossover event, Ryan was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. =John Trujillo= John Trujillo, the third Black Condor, art by Daniel Acuña Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #3 introduced a third Black Condor named John Trujillo whose home turf is the Arizona desert. John was given the hereditary powers of the Black Condor by Tocotl, a Mayan Spider Goddess. Trujillo sees himself as a protector of the universe. He first appears when he single-handedly rescues Uncle Sam and the other Freedom Fighters, who had been defeated by agents of S.H.A.D.E.. Trujillo is very serious and seems somewhat uncomfortable interacting with other people. In issue #6, he rebuffs romantic overtures by the Phantom Lady, correctly (as she realizes later) assuming she does not really mean it. The full extent of the third Black Condor's powers remains unrevealed. He can fly at extremely high speeds, control the wind, and may possess moderate superhuman strength and speed. Powers and abilities * The first Black Condor has the mutant ability to fly, although no limits are known as to speed, duration or altitude. Sometime after arriving on Earth-X, it became apparent that his mutant powers also included limited telekinesis abilities, most notably mind- over-matter. At times, the Black Condor carries a ray gun, the origin of which is unknown. When used, it fires a black force beam of adjustable power capable of stunning a man or breaking a brick wall. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and an Olympic level athlete * The second Black Condor possessed a talent for telekinesis which he also used to fly, as well as limited empathic abilities and a rapid healing rate. * The third Black Condor has so far only demonstrated the abilities of flight and wind/air-current control, but has been credited by Tocotl as an elemental of the sky and Earth. He also has a moderate level of superhuman strength and speed, and seems quite ruthless. Other versions *In a Bronze Age story, Mister Mxyzptlk shows Superman a gender-reversed Justice League. Amongst its members are the Black Condor, a male equivalent of the Black Canary. Superman #349 (in a story entitled \\"The Turnabout Trap!\\") *In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \\"Earth-10\\". As a result of Mister Mind \\"eating\\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the Pre-Crisis Earth-X, including the Quality characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to the Richard Grey, Jr. Black Condor appears. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-X. * New Super-Man features a character named the Blue Condor (an analog of the Black Condor). * Multiversity: The Mastermen features an African- American Black Condor as one of Uncle Sam's Freedom Fighters. In other mediaTelevision= * The Richard Grey Jr. version of Black Condor appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Cry Freedom Fighters!\\" voiced by Jason C. Miller. He appears as a member of the Freedom Fighters and accompanies them, Batman, and Plastic Man into freeing Qward from the government oppression caused by the Supreme Chairman of Qward. =Film= * The Black Condor was mentioned in Batman and Harley Quinn. =Web series= * The Earth-X John Trujillo version of the Black Condor appears in Freedom Fighters: The Ray, set partly in the Arrowverse, voiced by Jason Mitchell.

He was a fine scholar in early ecclesiastical history and became the accredited defender of the papal supremacy. For this reason his writings have often been very severely judged. His Antiquitas illustrata circa concilia generalia et provincialia (Antwerp, 1678) contains decrees of the popes and various matters of Catholic church history; in it he attacked the errors of Jean Launoy in regard to the primacy of Rome. Schelstrate was only able to issue two volumes of a second edition which he had planned on a large scale (1692 and 1697). He carried on controversies with Arnauld and Louis Maimbourg concerning the authority of the general councils and of the popes; he opposed the declaration of the Gallican clergy in 1682, and wrote a treatise on the origin of the Anglican Church in a controversy with Edward Stillingfleet, Dean of St. Paul's, London. He also published numerous other works. He died at Rome on 6 April 1692.

Considered an early American third party, it was started by John C. Calhoun sometime in May–December 1828. The Nullifier Party was a states' rights, pro-slavery party that supported the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, holding that states could nullify federal laws within their borders. It narrowly missed claiming the unofficial title of being the first ever third party to be created within the United States—that title belongs to the Anti-Masonic Party, which was created in New York in February 1828. The Nullifier Party had several members in both houses of the Congress between 1831 and 1839. Calhoun outlined the principles of the party in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest (1828), a reaction to the \\"Tariff of Abominations\\" passed by Congress and signed into law by President John Quincy Adams. The party supported Calhoun's ally John Floyd of Virginia for President in the 1832 presidential election and the state legislature gave Floyd South Carolina's 11 electoral votes, even though Floyd was not a candidate and had himself unsuccessfully tried to convince Calhoun to run for President. The party's candidate for Vice President was the Massachusetts-based political economist . After President Andrew Jackson left office, Calhoun and most of his followers joined the Democratic Party.

Anastasiya, formerly called Bolshevik Island, остров Болшевик) is a Bulgarian islet in the Black Sea. It is located 1.5 km off the coast near Chernomorets, at 12 metres above sea level, and covers a territory of one hectare. It is the only inhabited island off the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. The island is supplied with electricity and drinking water. It is named after the former St. Anastasia convent located on it. The convent had existed since the Middle Ages and was reconstructed during the 18th-19th century. It has been abandoned since 1923, when the island was transformed into a prison. In 1925, a group of 43 political prisoners (communists and anti-fascists), led by Teohar Bakardzhiev, revolted and escaped from the island, subsequently fleeing to the Soviet Union. In their honor, the island was renamed Bolshevik Island when the communists came into power in 1945. Bulgarian film director Rangel Valchanov based his 1958 film On The Small Island () on this event. A Bulgarian Burgas-based weekly newspaper, Factor, reported in 2006 that the Movement for Rights and Freedoms leader, Ahmed Dogan, visited the island and expressed desire to privatize it. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, however, which claims the island is its property, objected. Today, in addition to the monastery with its church, there is a lighthouse situated on the island, as well as a museum, a restaurant, a small quay, a conference hall and two guesthouses with a total of five rooms available to tourists.

Most of the other parts of the city were either independent towns and villages previously, or they were built later. Many of the characteristic buildings of Miskolc can be found in the city centre, although the most famous ones, like the castle of Diósgyőr or the Cave Bath of Lillafüred are outside of it. Széchenyi street The City Hall The most significant street of the city is the István Széchenyi street, which is a continuation of the Bajcsy-Zsilinszky street leading to Tiszai station. Széchenyi street runs through the Downtown and through most of the city from east to west. The part of the street between the Szinvapark shopping mall and City Hall Square was pedestrianized in the early 1980s, except for the Miskolc trams. This part is colloquially called \\"Main street\\". Most of the houses on both sides are from the late 19th century, built after the Great Flood, which destroyed most of the downtown. Some regard Hungary Széchenyi street as the longest main street in Europe—but this is inaccurate, since Széchenyi street itself is only about 1 km long, and even in Miskolc several streets are many times longer. It is, however, one of nine streets that, as straight continuations of each other, form the longest (about 12 km) street of the city. These are (East to West): Bajcsy-Zsilinszky street – Széchenyi street – Hunyadi street – Tizeshonvéd street – Győri kapu – Andrássy street – General Ernő Kiss street – Árpád street – Hegyalja street. This long street runs nearly the length of the city, including the city centre and historical Diósgyőr, and is crossed by over 100 minor streets, but in common speech only Széchenyi street is called main street. Significant buildings of the street include: * Rákóczi house: a Baroque building that was headquarters to Francis II Rákóczi during the revolution in the early 18th century. Today it houses the Gallery of Miskolc. The Dark Gate, one of the old town gates is next to it. * National Theatre of Miskolc: a neoclassical building constructed in 1857 in place of a previous one that burnt down. The International Opera Festival of Miskolc is organized here annually. The Theatre Museum can be found on Mrs Déry street, which connects Széchenyi street to Heroes Square. The crossing next to Centrum supermarket * Villanyrendőr (\\"traffic signal\\", though literally meaning \\"electric policeman\\") is a name of the crossing where Széchenyi street meets Kazinczy street. It got this name because it was the first place in the city where traffic lights were installed. Since the main street had been pedestrianized, traffic is not as heavy here as it used to be. Near Villanyrendőr and the Szinva stream, parallel to Széchenyi Street is the newest public square of the city, the Szinva Terrace. The shopping quarter of the city is found in the vicinity. City Hall Square and St. Stephen Square The statue of King St. Stephen. In the background: the Avas Lookout Tower, symbol of the city City Hall Square is to the north of Széchenyi street, at its eastern end. The city hall (built in Romantic style) and the neoclassical county hall can be found here, along with a not really pretty Széchenyi statue. St. Stephen Square is opposite to City Hall Square. Elizabeth Square Elizabeth Square (Erzsébet tér) is south from Széchenyi street. South from it is the Avas hill with the gothic Protestant church on it. The church is the oldest building of Miskolc proper (15th century). The carousel from the belfry next to the church can be heard even in City Hall Square. The Elizabeth Bath, the first Kossuth statue of the country and a fountain can be found on this square too. The oldest building of the Ottó Herman Museum is also not very far. It houses the mineral collection of the museum. Deák square The \\"Forester's Palace\\" – the forestry office Deák square is north from Széchenyi street and northwest from Heroes Square. Its famous buildings are the newly renovated building of the forestry office, the Gyula Feledy Gallery, a statue of József Lévay, and a Greek Orthodox church built between 1785 and 1806 with the largest iconostasis of Central Europe and the largest Greek Orthodox church museum of the country. Heroes' Square The Heroes' Square Heroes' Square (Hősök tere) is north from Széchenyi Street and Villanyrendőr. It has a monument dedicated to the heroes of the 1956 revolution (before the end of the Socialist era a monument of the Soviets stood on the square.) The square is bordered by 19th and early 20th century buildings: the Baroque Minorite church and the Ferenc Földes High School from north, the Postal Palace from east, the Synagogue of Miskolc from south (though its entrance is on Kazinczy street leading towards Széchenyi street) and the building of the Gergely Berzeviczy Secondary School from west. The complete refashioning of the square started in the spring of 2006. Mindszent (All Saints) square The square is surrounded by three large buildings: the Mindszent Church, the International Trade Center (the Communist party headquarters before 1990), and the national health insurance company building. The Baroque style church, several centuries ago, was the church of a small village called Mindszent (\\"All Saints\\"), which the city has since absorbed. The Baroque statue, Mary with the jar can be found here too. Búza tér (Wheat square) Búza tér is one of the main traffic hubs of the city. It has the largest bus station of the city; several bus lines have their end station here, both city and country buses. The largest marketplace of Miskolc can be found here too. Népkert Népkert (literally: \\"People's Garden\\") is the largest public park in the Downtown (cca 57 000 m²). Its highlights include the restaurant Népkerti Vigadó, the statue park and the first Queen Elisabeth statue of the country. The city's sport hall and the country library are next to the Népkert. On the other side of the road—which is the western border of Népkert—are two important buildings: the Kós House and main building of the Ottó Herman Museum.

The series aired on Fox Kids from 8 September 1990 to 23 November 1991. Repeats aired on Fox in 1992 and 1996, and on Fox Family from 1998 to 2000. The show, a sequel to the original film, is about mad scientist Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen and his associate Igor Smith turning the tomatoes in the town of San Zucchini into monsters. The evil doctor was battled by young John Finletter, and his friends Tara Boumdeay (secretly a human/tomato hybrid pretending to be a teenage girl) and F.T., a \\"Friendly Tomato\\" pretending to be a dog. Origin The original film Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was released by Four Square Productions in 1978. A parody of the giant menace movies of the 1950s, it became a cult hit and predated the movie-spoofing disaster film Airplane! by two years. The Killer Tomatoes might have remained in that genre had it not been for an unlikely intervention from an equally unlikely source. During the 1986–1987 season of Muppet Babies, there was a segment in the episode \\"The Weirdo Zone\\" upon which Baby Fozzie deals with how he once faced an 'Attack of the Silly Tomatoes'. The segment used clips from the movie and concluded with Baby Fozzie using a giant-sized ketchup bottle to capture the Silly Tomatoes (he told bad jokes and the large tomatoes launched themselves at him, only to be caught inside the bottle when he ducked out of the way). It became one of the higher-rated episodes of the season, so much that New World Pictures (the owner of Marvel Productions, which made Muppet Babies) approached Four Square about making a sequel to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Four Square had never intended to make a sequel but when New World approached them with a two-million dollar budget towards filming a potential sequel, John De Bello, Costa Dillon and Stephen Peace got to work on crafting a script. The resulting film, Return of the Killer Tomatoes, was a surprise success. New World was pleased with the results, and the company decided to duplicate the results of the film with an animated series aimed at a younger audience. Tweaking various characters and ideas from both Attack and Return, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Series was born and debuted as one of the first Saturday morning cartoons on the Fox Children's Network in the fall of 1990. There were many inside jokes to popular television series and movies that played out during the series' run. It often poked fun at itself or its low-budget film origins. Plot The series picks up five years after The Great Tomato War (much as the film Return of the Killer Tomatoes did), where tomatoes are banned. However that has not stopped Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from engaging in his experiments. Gangreen's ultimate goal is to rule the world and he will not let anyone stop him. But his most successful experiment may very well be his undoing. Tara Boumdeay, a tomato turned human, runs away from Gangreen, taking along her 'Brother', the fur-covered F.T., whom she passes off as a dog. They befriend Chad Finletter (nephew of the Great Tomato War veteran, Wilbur Finletter) who, after saving the pair from a tomato attack, gets Tara a job at his uncle Wilbur's Tomatoless Pizza Parlor. She shares their secret with Chad regarding the two of them being tomatoes and Chad vows to help them against whatever Gangreen has planned. That is where everyone stands at the start of the first episode, \\"Give A Little Whistle\\", where the evil Doctor sets his new plans into motion (and would continue through the first season). Season Two would center on Gangreen actually conquering the world in the debut episode. But Gangreen learns on a personal level the importance of the quote \\"Be careful what you wish for\\". He is overthrown by Zoltan and his gang of twice-mutated tomatoes, and is forced to join up with Chad, Tara, Wilbur and the rest of the Killer Tomato Task Force (other vets of the Great Tomato War). Main characters * Chad Finletter (voiced by Christian Guzek) - The main hero of the story. Chad is a bright ten-year-old boy living with his Uncle Wilbur, working as a pizza delivery boy for Wilbur's Pizza Palace. Chad is one of the few people to know the truth about Tara and F.T. really being tomatoes, but as an act of friendship promised to keep their secret. Chad is the real guiding force behind stopping Gangreen, but because he is a kid, nobody takes him seriously. By the end of season one however, Gangreen puts a bounty on Chad to stop his constant interference. During the second season, Chad became a more of a leader by convincing the others to free Gangreen to help their cause. On one occasion Chad show annoyance at the KTTF incompetence saying \\"What I'm going to do with this collection of maroons?\\" Oddly enough, in the movie \\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes,\\" Chad was an adult and Tara was a love interest. * Tara Boumdeay (voiced by Kath Soucie) - One of Dr. Gangreen's failed experiments. She abandoned his evil plans with F.T. and escaped to the Finletter's where she is Chad's best friend and waitress at Wilbur Finletter's Pizza Palace. Tara is a pretty teenage girl who has always liked Chad since he is always brave. She mostly wears a short red shirt, white shorts, and boots. Whenever salt is poured on her, Tara turns into a tomato. When pepper is poured on her, she sneezes and returns to her human form (usually given a tissue and blowing her nose afterward). She is also shown to have telepathic and telekinetic tomato powers. In the movie, she was actually Chad's girlfriend, but while she shows a definite interest in him, in the cartoon they never do more than occasionally hug. * Wilbur Finletter (voiced by Thom Bray) - Great Tomato War veteran, leader of the Killer Tomato Taskforce and owner of Finletter's Pizza Palace. He is Chad's uncle, and is very protective. He is frequently trying new recipes for his tomato-less pizzas, most of the time failing. He is still slightly delusional from the war and believes that the only good tomato is a squashed tomato. Although brave, he is not very smart, as he and every adult believe F.T. is just an ugly dog. During the second season, Wilbur became more of a rebel leader when the killer tomatoes conquered the planet. He even put aside his grudges when breaking Dr. Gangreen out of jail to help the KTTF with their cause. * F.T. (vocal effects provided by S. Scott Bullock) - Short for Fuzzy Tomato, F.T. was another failed experiment as he turned out cute, fuzzy, and completely unable to do anything destructive or evil. Right before Gangreen was going to destroy him, Tara rescued him and both ran off. Because of the tomato-hating world, F.T. masqueraded himself as \\"the world's ugliest dog\\". Chad is the only other person who knows what F.T really is, but promised to keep it a secret. Chad has found this easy so far as everybody besides those who know his secret believes he is a dog, and has not questioned its appearance. In a few episodes FT is referred to as Chad's dog as opposed to Tara's. * Whitley White (voiced by Neil Ross) - The only reporter for San Zucchini news station. Like most of the other adults on the show, Whitley is an idiot. He has a habit of showing up in different parts of town to report on the events of the show or the aftermath (sometimes simultaneously carrying on conversations with himself from both the KRUD studios and 'Live at the Scene'). Whitley also has the distinction of being the last human not to be captured or defeated by the Killer Tomatoes in the second season (probably because his narrative helped keep the plots moving). =Recurring characters= * Tomato Guy (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A character who appeared in every episode of the show. He would shout \\"Tomato\\" only to cause anybody in the area to panic. This was presumably inspired by the character Costa Dillon played in the original Attack of the Killer Tomatoes film, who simply says \\"Tomato\\" in a library and scares all of the patrons so much that they run out of the classroom screaming in fear. As an additional sidenote, Tomato Guy is usually used as a speaking extra in various episodes when he is not shouting \\"Tomato\\" (this feat was also performed by Costa Dillon, who portrayed several roles such as a reporter, police guard, representative of the Screen Actors' Guild and more in \\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\\"). It was later revealed in the Season Two episode \\"Stemming The Tide\\" that he makes fun of tomatoes because as a kid, he was served cold tomato soup at a family get-together (his cousin, who turned off the stove, bore a significant resemblance to a young Putrid T. Gangreen, though it was never made clear if the two of them were actually related). In any case, the soup was alive and pestering Tomato Guy until he captured it by covering his soup bowl with a saucer. He then cooked it on his relatives' stove. In Season One he is seen as a customer at Finletter's Pizza. Tara as a waitress is asking him to please make up his mind for a topping, after all, he could not kill anyone. The man responds \\"OK, do you have tomato?\\", which sends Tara into shock and reminds her of her horrible creation. She is revived by Uncle Wilbur who reassures her that the police have arrested him (presumably for violating the tomato prohibition laws) and that he will not be in the pizza parlor again for some time. His voice and design resembles that of Woody Allen. * The Censor Lady (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) - An old woman (in a similar vein to 'The Church Lady' character played by Dana Carvey on Saturday Night Live) who appears and tries to stop a character if they are doing some violence-related or imitable behavior (such as suggesting that instead of the vampire tomatoes biting people's necks they kiss them in the episode \\"Spatula, Prinze of Dorkness\\" the end result was her being the first kissing victim- turned-vampire. She has also been seen arguing with Chad about his skateboard safety equipment, etc.) It was revealed in the episode 'Streets of Ketchup' she was something similar to Tara because she turned into a prune when squirted with salt water. In 'Camp Casserole', she attempted to silence the singing of '99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall' on a bus by saying \\"This is a kids' show, you can't say beer!\\" After the first season, she only appeared three times; the first time in the second season opener (\\"The Ripening Disaster\\") where she warned the audience about the violence that was overtaking the episode and threatened to end it early. Standing behind a red background, it soon becomes apparent that the red background is indeed Zoltan, who eats the Censor Lady and spits her back out (completely red from head to toe). She is then seen in the beginning of the second episode of season two briefly walking with the other world leaders who are all red from head to toe (apparently suffering the same fate as the Censor Lady). The final appearance was in \\"The Tomatoes Worms Turn\\" where she first made sure those in the African ride were buckled in as well as preventing the audience from hearing what Tomato Worms actually do to tomatoes. * Sam Smith (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) - A member of the Killer Tomato Taskforce. Sam is a master of disguise, but yet his most recognisable outfit is that of the Lone Ranger. Also known as 'Sam The Sham'. * Floyd Bridgework (voiced by Thom Bray) - A member of the Killer Tomato Taskforce. Floyd is an underwater expert, and is never seen without his scuba gear on, even when trying on a disguise or something like skating. He is often confused with his live-action counterpart underwater expert Greg Colburn due to the similarities the two have in design and concept. * Mary Jo Nagamininashy (voiced by Kath Soucie) - A member of the Killer Tomato Taskfroce. Mary Jo is the only female on the team besides Tara. She is a German athlete that is always into exercise, even when battling tomatoes. She is often confused with her live-action counterpart Russian Olympic athlete Gretta Attenbaum due to the similarities the two have in design and concept. * Mayor Leonard Earwax (voiced by Cam Clarke) - The Mayor of San Zucchini. As his last name implies, he may very well be the stupidest character living in the San Diego-inspired city. He is an airhead who somehow lucked into his job. He made two significant appearances in the series, one where he slept through San Zucchini being overthrown (as shown in the first- season episode \\"Invasion of the Tomato Snatchers\\") and an appearance where he decides to name Wilbur Finletter as San Zucchini's first Sheriff since the 1920s (as shown in the episode \\"The Gang That Couldn't Squirt Straight\\"). An election poster could be seen of him as well in the episode \\"Give A Little Whistle\\". =Villains= * Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen (voiced by John Astin) - The main villain of the series. An 'angry' scientist (as opposed to a 'mad' one), Dr. Gangreen created the killer tomatoes with the goal of global domination. Along with his dull-witted assistant, Igor Smith, and army of tomatoes led by his head tomato, Zoltan, he is always trying to destroy San Zucchini and conquer the world. Dr. Gangreen, on occasion would be breaking the fourth wall with antics such as firing 'bullets' from his Tomatocoptor, but then making the comment \\"Dang! If this were prime time (television), I could have used real bullets\\", suggesting that Dr. Gangreen realizes he is part of a children's cartoon show (other characters also realize it at times) and the network censors are clearly not going to permit him to commit violent acts. Although being a genius, he miscalculated two \\"failures\\" that became large obstacles in his plans. Fuzzy Tomato (or F.T. as he is called) and Tara, who abandoned him to live with humans. Viewers learned much about Dr. Gangreen in the first season, from the fact that he was the first man to domesticate the wild turnip and ate an entire lawnmower at the age of six (as revealed in the episode \\"Give A Little Whistle\\") to playing in a high school rock band named \\"Mothra and the Handpuppets\\" (as revealed in the episode \\"Streets of Ketchup\\"). In the episode \\"War of the Weirds\\" it was revealed that Gangreen's skin color and obsession with tomatoes came from his childhood rivalry with Sidney Igotcha, a rivalry that continued when Sidney became a scientist himself and used Killer Kumquats to try to take over San Zucchini. During the second season, Gangreen accomplished his goals of conquering Earth, only to be overthrown by Zoltan and imprisoned when it became apparent that conquering the world had an oddly calming effect on the scientist. He was busted out of jail by the Killer Tomato Taskforce and joined them in attempts to defeat Zoltan and the killer tomatoes once and for all. It was implied in \\"Stemming the Tide\\" that he was the cousin of Tomato Guy, though it was never revealed conclusively one way or the other. He is a homage to John Astin's Mortimer Gangreen in the movies. ** Igor Smith (voiced by Cam Clarke) - Igor Smith is an air-headed young man from Malibu who dreams of becoming a TV reporter. He is not really evil, but more of a man that fell into the wrong crowd. Still, he will do his master's work without question if it means that he will be rewarded for helping conquer the planet by being made a reporter. He takes any chance he gets to usurp Whitley White. During the second season, Igor was imprisoned with his master after being overthrown by Zoltan, only to be busted out by the Killer Tomato Taskforce, joining them in attempting to defeat the killer tomatoes once and for all. =Tomatoes= Besides Tara and F.T., the following characters are tomatoes that were created by Dr. Gangreen: * Zoltan (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - Dr. Gangreen's tomato commander. At first, Zoltan was a failed experiment originating from when Igor accidentally had placed old movies into their programming stage instead of training videos, causing him and his gang of five to be lazy and to imitate old movie characters occasionally (such as legendary actor James Cagney). Perhaps echoing what the future was to hold for Zoltan, he underwent a transformation into a vampire tomato, dubbing himself \\"Spatula, Prince of Dorkness\\" (shown in the episode of the same name) and proceeded to kiss people on the neck to transform humans and tomatoes alike into vampires (a stipulation that the Censor Lady put into place in fear of showing the biting and bloodshed associated with vampires on a Saturday morning cartoon). Fortunately that was undone by Dracula himself, who, after handing Wilbur Finletter a cure for the vampirism, declared that the people of San Zucchini did not have the class to be vampires, nor did he want the bad press associated with the citizens' sole night of terror (despite the fact that Dracula himself had given Dr. Gangreen the vampire serum that changed Zoltan into a vampire early in the episode). During the second season, Zoltan and his gang were given a transformation, becoming larger, smarter, and deadlier. Zoltan and his gang conquered the planet and were each issued a continent to rule (e.g. Zoltan controls North America). Soon after that, Zoltan realized they did not need Gangreen anymore and overthrew him, allowing Zoltan to seize control of leader. The series was ended before a final episode resolving matters could be made, but it is assumed among fans that Zoltan and his tomatoes were eventually defeated in the end by the one thing Gangreen knew could destroy them, the African Tomato Worms. ** Tomacho (voiced by Cam Clarke) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Tomacho rules over South America, and is known as being very calm and chill but also dimwitted. Tomacho speaks like John Travolta and with a surfer accent. In the episode where the gang is temporarily turned into humans, Tomacho becomes a muscular, good-looking young man with long hair, true to his name. ** Beefsteak (voiced by Chuck McCann) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Beefsteak rules over Europe, and is known for his short temper. Beefsteak has bull horns on his head and wears a nose ring, which only helps his image of charging at enemies like a bull. ** Fang (voiced by Susan Silo) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Fang rules over Africa, and is known for his snake-like personality. Fang has serpent eyes, a snake's tongue and large fangs filled with venom. Fang had the biggest problem with his continent due to his soldiers not returning from the \\"Heart of Africa\\". Fang temporary took control of the Gang of Six in the last episode, but returned control over to Zoltan after his defeat by him. ** Ketchuck (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Ketchunk rules over all of Asia and is known for being the biggest and fattest of the gang of six. Besides being large, Ketchunk is constantly drooling and always hungry for food. ** Mummato (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - One of Zoltan's gang of six. Mummato rules over Australia and New Zealand, and is known for his silence (though he does speak on rare occasions; his voice sounds much like Marlon Brando). Mummato is wrapped in bandages like a mummy. * Phantomato (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A deformed tomato that sought refuge in the sewers after the tomatoes seized control of Earth. He hid his face behind a mask just like the Phantom of the Opera, and even had his own pipe organ. He saved Tara from Zoltan and Beefsteak and offered to help her find Gangreen once he was finished playing his organ. When the tomatoes located them and attempted to capture Tara again, he saved her by holding off the tomato soldiers while they escaped. Even though he only appeared in one episode and was one of the few good tomatoes, he received a figure in the toyline and was featured as a boss in the video game. * The Ultimato - The last tomato experiment made by Dr. Gangreen. He was originally made to help the task force by fighting off the tomatoes, but later turned on them when he wanted to seize control for himself. * Link (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A deformed tomato that was believed to be the missing link between normal, dormant tomatoes and the killer variety. First appearing in the episode \\"Tomato From The Black Lagoon\\", it is revealed that Link is not quite like his killer cousins. He aids Chad and Tara against Gangreen and Igor (Gangreen originally sought Link out to use him in a renewed effort to destroy San Zucchini). He is also very wealthy, as his lair is equipped with state-of-the- art technology and the finest foods. He appeared in a second-season episode, aiding Tara and Chad in their efforts to locate the African Tomato Worms. It is established in both this episode and the episode which the Phantomato debuted (\\"The Phantomato of the Opera\\") that the two of them are actually cousins. * Johnny Tomato (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - Inspired by his love of 1950s rockabilly music (and a desire to erase the mistakes he made when he first created Tara), Dr. Gangreen created a tomato that could change into a human named Johnny Tomato. Johnny (who looked almost exactly like a young 1950s-era Elvis Presley) was to be used to lure both The KTTF and Chad, Tara and FT to their doom. Johnny's conflicted emotions between loyalty to Gangreen (posing as Johnny's 'manager', Colonel Sam Green) and budding feelings towards Tara led to Johnny succumbing to the same allergy to salt that plagued Tara. It was then, with Gangreen's plot exposed, that Johnny (in a dormant tomato form) was swept away by Gangreen's army of Killer Tomatoes (all of this was shown in the first-season episode \\"Streets of Ketchup\\"). Though the character never appeared again, it was revealed in the second-season episode \\"The Phantomato of the Opera\\" that Johnny survived, as Wilbur Finletter (dressed in a 1970s-era Elvis jumpsuit) infiltrated an Elvis Presley Impersonator Contest in Memphis, Tennessee, searching for Dr. Gangreen (the whole episode concentrated on that plot point as other cast members searched other locations around the globe in their efforts to locate the angry scientist). Wilbur actually won himself a picture with Johnny Tomato due to his placing last in the competition. * Tomato Minions are all the other mutated tomatoes in the series. They act as soldiers to Professor Gangreen and Zoltan. In the 1st season they came in different colors which was yellow, green and orange but most of them are red of course. In the 2nd season they all were red and wore Roman-style war helmets and patrolled all parts of the world. They all looked the same as well. EpisodesSeason 1: 1990Season 2: 1991=Cancellation Numerous changes from season one to season two factored in the cancellation of the series. The show was now animated in a much different style than viewers were used to (the second season is known for being the first Saturday Morning cartoon series to be computer animated), the single episode plots were done away with in favor of an ongoing storyline (partly due to the series changing story editors between seasons), no more than eight episodes were made for this second season (shown out of sequence in its initial run, no less) and changes to already-established characters contradicted facts and events that viewers witnessed in season one (such as Tara now being able to change into a tomato even if salt was not utilized at times, her being a tomato was now public knowledge, and she could move freely around and talk in her tomato form; none of these were true of Tara in season one). The final change came in the form of taking the comedy-relief provided by Zoltan and the Gang of Five and doing away with that in favor of turning them into serious threats.

The leaders of the plot were three prominent priests from the village of Candolim in the concelho of Bardez, Goa. They belonged to the Pinto clan, hence the name of the rebellion. Principal characters * Fr. José Custódio de Faria, also known as Abbé Faria, was a monk and one of the pioneers of the scientific study of hypnotism. He is dramatized as the character of the 'mad' monk imprisoned at the Château d'If in the famous novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. * Fr. Caetano Vitorino de Faria, the mastermind * Fr. Caetano Francisco do Couto * Fr. José António Gonçalves of Divar * Judge José da Rocha Dantas e Mendonça, Judge of the Goa High Court and of the inquest into the conspiracy. * Ignacio Pinto, head of the Pinto clan and a fervent supporter of Fr. Faria.  Causes  The root of the dissent was that missionaries from Portugal (the Dominicans, Franciscans and Jesuits) were dominating the churches and Government services in Goa towards the end of the 18th century. The conspiracy was inspired by the propaganda of the political agitators that shortly after brought about the French Revolution. José António and Caetano visited Rome and Portugal to plead for their being appointed as Bishops, but were refused. As a result of this refusal, they hatched the conspiracy along with Abbé Faria. They also managed to obtain the sympathy of similarly disaffected Christians in the Army and local clergy. The conspirators also negotiated with Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, so that, when they had thrown Goa into disorder, he would invade and give the finishing touch. The conspiracy was given up by one of the conspirators to the authorities thereby preventing invasion from Mysorian muslim sultanate. The local Christians were being ignored for any prestigious or responsible positions. But it seems it was these Goan priests being bypassed in favour of the South Indian St. Thomas clerics (particularly Bishop Joseph Kariattil) for the appointment to the vacant sees of Cranganore and Mylapore that was last straw on the camel's back. P. Kamat mentions that the protests of the various priests she studied for their non-submission to the Portuguese authority in Goa were by and large manifestations of their immediate personal grievances arising out of racial discrimination and administrative abuses.  Aftermath  The conspiracy being made known to the authorities, they took vigorous steps to pre-empt it. Some of the conspirators fled in disguise to British territory. However, the authorities arrested and punished 47 persons, including 17 priests and seven army officers. The area around the present day GPO (General Post Office) in Panjim is called São Tomé. The present GPO building used to be the old tobacco house, and the building to its right was the Government Mint. The area in front of these buildings was the old Panjim pillory and used to be the site of public executions, and was where fifteen conspirators of the failed revolt were executed. Gonçalves fled to British territory and lived the remainder of his life as an English teacher in Calcutta. Abbé Faria teamed up with the French Revolutionaries and participated along with the \\"juring\\" clerics in the Revolutionaries' brutal persecution of the Catholic Church in France and elsewhere. For decades after, the Conspiracy was used as a stick to defame and denigrate Goan missionaries and priests in British India by their opponents, the Vicars Apostolic of the Propaganda party, Goans being of the Padroado party. The incident was used to represent the Goans to the British government and to the Christians in British India as untrustworthy, rebellious and willing to compromise with their own enemies (Tipu Sultan).

He composed (or contributed to) some forty musical comedies and operettas. Caryll's career encompassed three eras of the musical theatre, and unlike some of his contemporaries, he adapted readily to each new development. After composing a few musical burlesques, his first great successes were made in light musical comedies, epitomised by the George Edwardes productions at London's Gaiety Theatre, such as The Shop Girl, The Circus Girl, The Gay Parisienne, and A Runaway Girl. He continued to write musical comedies throughout the next decade, including such hits as The Messenger Boy, The Toreador, The Girl From Kays, The Earl and the Girl, The Orchid, The Spring Chicken, The Girls of Gottenberg and Our Miss Gibbs. He also wrote some operetta scores, such as The Duchess of Dantzic. After this, he moved to New York City, where his post-war works, incorporating new fox-trot and one-step rhythms, included The Girl Behind the Gun (later a London hit as Kissing Time). At the peak of his career, he had the unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the West End. Life and career Caryll was born in Liège, Belgium, the son of Henry Tilkin, an engineer.Gänzl, Kurt, \\"Caryll, Ivan (1861–1921)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 12 January 2011 He studied at the Liège Conservatoire, where he was a fellow student of Eugène Ysaÿe. He then moved to France to study singing at the Paris Conservatoire, where a classmate was Rose Caron.\\"A Chat with Mr. Ivan Caryll\\", Musical Opinion and Music Trade Review, August 1897, p. 756 He moved to London in 1882. He was married for a time in the 1890s to Gilbert and Sullivan star Geraldine Ulmar. Later, he married Maud Hill. He had a daughter named Primrose Caryll, who became an actress. The dashing, moustachioed Caryll was known as one of the best dressed men in London. He was an extravagant spender and a popular and lavish host, entertaining his theatrical friends in princely style. Caryll's free spending ways caused him trouble occasionally, and he had a few narrow escapes from his creditors.\\"Ivan Caryll\\" at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive's British Musical Theatre pages, 24 December 2003, accessed 11 January 2011 =Early career= The Girl from Paris At first, Caryll earned a poor living by giving music lessons to women in the suburbs. Then he sold some songs to George Edwardes, who eventually hired him as the musical director for the Gaiety and Lyric Theatres. He attempted to raise orchestral standards by banning the deputy system, under which a player who was offered a lucrative engagement could send a substitute to perform in the theatre. Caryll's first theatre piece was Lily of Léoville in 1886. He sent the score to Camille Saint-Saëns, who used his influence to have it staged at the Bouffes Parisiens. Violet Melnotte secured the English rights, and it was presented in London featuring a young Hayden Coffin.Lily of Leoville at the Guide to Musical Theatre, accessed 29 October 2009 This was followed the same year by Monte Cristo Jr., a burlesque for the Gaiety and then by a number of shows produced for the Lyric, culminating with the very successful Little Christopher Columbus (1893). In 1890, he added numbers to the English-language version of La cigale et la fourmi.Traubner, pp. 89–90 Caryll, known as a very expressive conductor, conducted W. S. Gilbert and Alfred Cellier's The Mountebanks at the Lyric in 1892. Cellier died during rehearsals for the piece, and Caryll wrote the overture, the entr'acte, and finished some of the orchestration. His work on the piece received critical praise.Walker, Raymond J. \\"Alfred Cellier (1844-1891): The Mountebanks, comic opera (1892); and Suite Symphonique (1878)\\", Music Web International, 2018 Also in 1892, with George Dance, Caryll adapted an opéra comique called Ma mie Rosette, based on a French piece by Paul Lacôme, starring Jessie Bond and Courtice Pounds at the Globe Theatre.Moss, Simon. Programmes and descriptions of 1892 productions of Ma mie Rosette, Gilbert & Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 27 December 1892, p. 6 Caryll recalled of this production that he had been much criticised for adding numbers to Lacome's original score, although Lacome had specially requested him to do so. Caryll's first big success at the Gaiety was The Shop Girl (1894), which ran for an almost unprecedented 546 performances and heralded a new form of respectable musical comedy in London. The composer conducted the piece himself. Meanwhile, Caryll also had success elsewhere. The Gay Parisienne (1896), written with George Dance, ran for 369 performances at the Duke of York's Theatre, played in New York as The Girl from Paris (281 performances) and toured internationally. At the same time, he continued to compose shows at other theatres, including the comic opera Dandy Dick Whittington (1895), at the Avenue Theatre, with a libretto by George Robert Sims.Adams, William Davenport. A Dictionary of the Drama: a Guide to the Plays, Playwrights, Vol. 1, pp. 374–75, Chatto & Windus, 1904 Cover of Vocal Score The Pink Lady Caryll composed the music for almost all the Gaiety musical comedies over the next decade, in collaboration with Lionel Monckton, and also established himself as the most famous conductor of light music in England. Edwardes apparently liked to have the word 'girl' in the titles of the shows, so The Shop Girl was followed by My Girl, The Circus Girl (with over 500 performances in 1896 and 1897) and A Runaway Girl (1898). The Lucky Star was a less successful three-act comic opera (1899, produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, based on L'Etoile, an opéra-bouffe by Emmanuel Chabrier). It may have been too risqué for the Savoy Theatre audiences. Caryll was said to compose very quickly in intense bouts. His scores were noted for swirling waltzes and semi-operatic finales. He often took trips to Paris and elsewhere in search of new musical plays that he could adapt into English. Caryll's output also included songs, dances and salon pieces for his own light orchestra, for which Edward Elgar composed his shapely Serenade Lyrique in 1899.Profile of Caryll from Musicweb International =20th century London pieces= After the turn of the century, Caryll wrote more successful scores, including The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador (1901) (with well over 600 performances), The Ladies' Paradise (1901) (libretto by George Dance; the first musical comedy to be presented at the Metropolitan Opera in New York),Lamb, Andrew, \\"Caryll, Ivan\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 12 January 2011 ; the piece closed quickly and controversially there, with the cast unpaid.

Despite these successes, Caryll began to grow jealous of Monckton, who often wrote the most popular numbers in the shows. Still, they continued to work together, producing several successes: The Spring Chicken (1905), The New Aladdin (1906), The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), and the even more popular Our Miss Gibbs (1909), which ran for 636 performances. Typical of the plots of these shows, Our Miss Gibbs concerns a shop girl, courted by an earl in disguise. During this period, Caryll also wrote the less successful The Little Cherub (1906). Many of Caryll's musicals were given in Paris, Vienna, and Budapest at a time when the English-language musicals were largely ignored on the continent, and he composed original scores for Paris (S.A.R., or Son altesse royale, 1908) and Vienna (Die Reise nach Cuba, 1901). =Broadway musicals= Caryll relocated to New York City in 1911, composing more than a dozen Broadway musicals,Brief profile of Caryll at the musicals101 website including The Pink Lady (1911, with Hugh Morton), Oh!

The station is currently owned by Trustees of Columbia University in New York and serves the local region. WKCR-FM broadcasts in the HD (hybrid) format.http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=1 History What is now known as WKCR-FM originated in the early part of the twentieth century as the Columbia University Radio Club (CURC). An exact date of origin is not known, but documentation of the CURC as an ongoing organization exists as early as 1908. The club was not a radio station as we know it, but rather an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. The group shared a prestigious association with Major Edwin Armstrong (E '13), the man who invented FM broadcast technology. This association accounts for the marginally accurate phrase, \\"The Original FM,\\" that one will often hear alongside the WKCR call letters. In 1939, Major Armstrong turned his attentions towards commercial broadcasting. This spurred the CURC to shift from a club concerned with radio technology to a de facto radio station that provided broadcasts to the campus. The FCC granted the station its license on October 10, 1941. For the next three decades, the entirely student-run organization operated two stations. The largely popular-music AM station broadcast only on-campus through a carrier current system, while WKCR-FM was heard throughout the New York City area through conventional FM broadcasting as an intellectual radio station (The AM station was allowed to die off in the 1970s). Programming was largely Columbia sports, classroom events, classical music, and broadcasts from the United Nations, including many interviews with representatives of foreign nations. When Sputnik 1 was launched on October 4, 1957 staff members of WKCR recorded its signal during the satellite's first pass over the United States, and became the first North American radio station to rebroadcast this signal. The next morning the FBI took the tape, which has never been returned or paid for. Subsequent to the student uprising of 1968, the format changed in the early 1970s. The station shifted its emphasis from being an illustration of the university to presenting commercially inviable programming to the New York metropolitan area. Jazz became the core of this broadcast approach, which is neatly summarized in the slogan, \\"The Alternative.\\" The descriptions of individual departments contain information about WKCR's concept of alternative programming. Around this time the station changed its policy from being entirely run by Columbia undergraduates as an extracurricular activity to employing graduates and then others unassociated with the university. The rise of jazz on WKCR also led to the accelerated activity of live performance in the station's studios, and eventually to records released\\"WKCR and Oblivion The Oblivion Records Blog from those recordings. Sessions booked by former student DJ David Reitman led to many of the jazz and blues hosts bringing in musicians such as Gunter Hampel,\\"Gunter Hampel > Spirits\\" Kathleen Loves Music Karl Berger, Tyrone Washington, Charles Walker (Blues from the Apple),\\"Recording 'Blues from the Apple'\\" The Oblivion Records Blog and Mississippi Fred McDowell.\\"Prepping 'Live in New York for LP\\" The Oblivion Records Blog In the late 70s, under the direction of Tim Page, the station presented the radio premieres of several leading minimalist compositions, including Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach and Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians. It was the first station in the country to pay attention to this important and eventually popular form of avant-garde music. Page also produced a benefit concert for the station at Carnegie Hall, with appearances by Reich, Glass, John Cale, and David Bowie, among many others. In 1977, the station became the first radio (or television) station to transmit from the antenna at the top of the World Trade Center, having previously broadcast from the old Channel 5 antenna on the DuMont Building, a 42-story structure at 515 Madison Avenue.Fraser, C. Gerald.\\"WKCR Will Be the First Station To Transmit From Trade Center\\", The New York Times, July 30, 1977. Accessed September 27, 2008. WKCR was home to the groundbreaking underground Hip-Hop Show The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito García Show from 1990–1998. The show provided early exposure for what became some of the biggest names in hip- hop, Wu-Tang Clan and Notorious B.I.G. among them. A 2015 documentary, Stretch and Bobbito: Radio That Changed Lives, explored the influence of the radio show on hip hop music. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, the station underwent a difficult period. Broadcasting from its backup transmitter atop Carman Hall, the station finally secured a new antenna at 4 Times Square in 2003. In late December 2015, WKCR announced on its website that effective January 1, it would be ending its online broadcast while it reconsidered its ability to stream online and continued to broadcast on the FM band. On July 1, 2016, the station announced its return to online streaming following technical and logistical improvements.

The town is the headquarters of Pategi Emirate. It is inhabited by the Nupe people who also exhibit a linguistic repertoire of the Yoruba dialect. They are farmers, aquatic sellers/fishers and traders. They are known to be governed by a monarch. Currently, a new Monarch, in the person of Umar Bologi II, was appointed, by the Government of the State, who happened to be a custom officer in before his appointment to the Office as the leader of Etsu Community. Settlement Pategi is a Nupe town along the banks of the Niger River. The township is located within Pategi Local Government Area. The local government is one of the largest Fadama lowlands in the state with River Niger as the primary source of water. The people The Nupe people of Pategi are majorly farmers- harvesting cassava, millet, rice, guinea corn, melon. They also make a lot of local snacks such as \\"efan\\", \\"gbankuru\\", \\"liala\\", Kuli-kuli, \\"dankuwa\\" \\"banbara\\", \\"alewa\\" etc. The people of Pategi also engage in fishing. They are also very industrious. History The settlement of Pategi had existed before the founding of Pategi Emirate but the growth and importance of Pategi grew as a result of the movement of the Edegi ruling house from Gbara and Bida to Pategi, forming a new emirate.https://allafrica.com/stories/201501080267.html The Pategi Kwara =Pategi Emirate= The history of the town is linked with the history of Pategi Emirate. The emirate's formation came as a result of the British conquest of Bida. Bida was originally the home of the Tsoede Nupe dynasty. However, in 1857, Mallan Dendo who was a Fulani itinerant preacher and a follower of Uthman Dan Fodio and his followers dislodged the Nupe rulers who were already split into factions and established a Fulani emirate. However, there were intermittent opposition by some indigenous or Nupe groups to the rule of Dendo descendants in Bida. Among these rebel groups was the Yissazzhi faction, originally led by Jimada a claimant to the Bida throne prior to the Fulani dynasty of 1857 and in 1897, by Idrissu Gana. They had reluctantly supported the Fulani Emir of Bida in battles against other indigenous rebel groups but when the British waged was against the Fulani emirate of Bida, the group laid down their arms and refused to join Bida. After the British conquest, the Yissazhi under Idrissu Gana were allowed to have their own emirate at Pategi. During colonial rule, Pategi was a district within Ilorin province and it is the location of the first successful mission of the Sudan Interior Mission. Regatta Pategi hosts a boat Pategi Regatta Festival on the terrain of the Niger River in Pategi Beach. In a paper by late Prof. Idrees Aliyu A. \\"The Patigi Regatta Festival: its origin, historical significance and tourism prospects\\"; the idea of the Pategi Regatta Festival was conceived in 1950 by the traditional Council of Pategi Emirate under the leadership of Etsu Umaru Bologi and Ahman Pategi, and was inaugurated in 1953. It is a biennial event involving the people of Pategi Emirate and residents living along the banks of the Niger in Kwara, Niger and Kogi states. The main part of the festival consists of canoe races and displays on the Niger at Gbaradogi on the west bank; the second part of the festival takes place in the palace of the Etsu of Pategi and involves a variety of Nupe cultural displays. The festival attracts many tourists from far and wide. ReferencesFurther reading *Ewald, Janet (1975).

Hiroshige is best known for his horizontal-format landscape series The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō and for his vertical-format landscape series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. The subjects of his work were atypical of the ukiyo-e genre, whose typical focus was on beautiful women, popular actors, and other scenes of the urban pleasure districts of Japan's Edo period (1603–1868). The popular series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai was a strong influence on Hiroshige's choice of subject, though Hiroshige's approach was more poetic and ambient than Hokusai's bolder, more formal prints. Subtle use of color was essential in Hiroshige's prints, often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and with extensive use of bokashi (color gradation), both of which were rather labor-intensive techniques. For scholars and collectors, Hiroshige's death marked the beginning of a rapid decline in the ukiyo-e genre, especially in the face of the westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Hiroshige's work came to have a marked influence on western European painting towards the close of the 19th century as a part of the trend in Japonism. Western European artists, such as Manet and Monet, collected and closely studied Hiroshige's compositions. Vincent van Gogh even went so far as to paint copies of two of Hiroshige's prints from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. Early life and apprenticeship Wind Blown Grass Across the Moon – by Hiroshige Hiroshige studied under Toyohiro of the Utagawa school of artists. Returning Sails at Tsukuda, from Eight Views of Edo, early-19th century Hiroshige was born in 1797 in the Yayosu Quay section of the Yaesu area in Edo (modern Tokyo). He was of a samurai background, and is the great-grandson of Tanaka Tokuemon, who held a position of power under the Tsugaru clan in the northern province of Mutsu. Hiroshige's grandfather, Mitsuemon, was an archery instructor who worked under the name Sairyūken. Hiroshige's father, Gen'emon, was adopted into the family of Andō Jūemon, whom he succeeded as fire warden for the Yayosu Quay area. Hiroshige went through several name changes as a youth: Jūemon, Tokubē, and Tetsuzō. He had three sisters, one of whom died when he was three. His mother died in early 1809, and his father followed later in the year, but not before handing his fire warden duties to his twelve-year-old son. He was charged with prevention of fires at Edo Castle, a duty that left him much leisure time. Not long after his parents' deaths, perhaps at around fourteen, Hiroshige—then named Tokutarō— began painting. He sought the tutelage of Toyokuni of the Utagawa school, but Toyokuni had too many pupils to make room for him. A librarian introduced him instead to Toyohiro of the same school. By 1812 Hiroshige was permitted to sign his works, which he did under the art name Hiroshige. He also studied the techniques of the well-established Kanō school, the nanga whose tradition began with the Chinese Southern School, and the realistic Shijō school, and likely the linear perspective techniques of Western art and uki-e. Hiroshige's apprentice work included book illustrations and single-sheet ukiyo-e prints of female beauties and kabuki actors in the Utagawa style, sometimes signing them Ichiyūsai or, from 1832, Ichiryūsai. In 1823, he passed his post as fire warden on to his son, though he still acted as an alternate. He declined an offer to succeed Toyohiro upon the master's death in 1828. Landscapes, flora, and fauna It was not until 1829–1830 that Hiroshige began to produce the landscapes he has come to be known for, such as the Eight Views of Ōmi series. He also created an increasing number of bird and flower prints about this time. About 1831, his Ten Famous Places in the Eastern Capital appeared, and seem to bear the influence of Hokusai, whose popular landscape series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji had recently seen publication. An invitation to join an official procession to Kyoto in 1832 gave Hiroshige the opportunity to travel along the Tōkaidō route that linked the two capitals. He sketched the scenery along the way, and when he returned to Edo he produced the series The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō, which contains some of his best-known prints. Hiroshige built on the series' success by following it with others, such as the Illustrated Places of Naniwa (1834), Famous Places of Kyoto (1835), another Eight Views of Ōmi (1834). As he had never been west of Kyoto, Hiroshige-based his illustrations of Naniwa (modern Osaka) and Ōmi Province on pictures found in books and paintings. Hiroshige11 hakone.jpgPrint 11: Hakone Hiroshige16 kanbara.jpgPrint 16: Kanbara Hiroshige, Travellers surprised by sudden rain.jpgPrint 46: Rain Shower at Shōno Hiroshige's first wife helped finance his trips to sketch travel locations, in one instance selling some of her clothing and ornamental combs. She died in October 1838, and Hiroshige remarried to Oyasu, sixteen years his junior, daughter of a farmer named Kaemon from Tōtōmi Province. Around 1838 Hiroshige produced two series entitled Eight Views of the Edo Environs, each print accompanied by a humorous kyōka poem. The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō saw print between about 1835 and 1842, a joint production with Keisai Eisen, of which Hiroshige's share was forty-six of the seventy prints. Hiroshige produced 118 sheets for the One Hundred Famous Views of EdoForbes & Henley (2014). Full series over the last decade of his life, beginning about 1848.

Gen'emon and his wife died in 1809, when Hiroshige was 12 years old, just a few months after his father had passed the position on to him. Although his duties as a fire-fighter were light, he never shirked these responsibilities, even after he entered training in Utagawa Toyohiro's studio. He eventually turned his firefighter position over to his brother, Tetsuzo, in 1823, who in turn passed on the duty to Hiroshige's son in 1832. Snow, Moon and Flowers\\" =Hiroshige's students= Hiroshige II was a young print artist, Chinpei Suzuki, who married Hiroshige's daughter, Otatsu. He was given the artist name of \\"Shigenobu\\". Hiroshige intended to make Shigenobu his heir in all matters, and Shigenobu adopted the name \\"Hiroshige\\" after his master's death in 1858, and thus today is known as Hiroshige II. However, the marriage to Otatsu was troubled and in 1865 they separated. Otatsu was remarried to another former pupil of Hiroshige, Shigemasa, who appropriated the name of the lineage and today is known as Hiroshige III. Both Hiroshige II and Hiroshige III worked in a distinctive style based on that of Hiroshige, but neither achieved the level of success and recognition accorded to their master. Other students of Hiroshige I include Utagawa Shigemaru, Utagawa Shigekiyo, and Utagawa Hirokage.

In his declining years, Hiroshige still produced thousands of prints to meet the demand for his works, but few were as good as those of his early and middle periods. He never lived in financial comfort, even in old age. In no small part, his prolific output stemmed from the fact that he was poorly paid per series, although he was still capable of remarkable art when the conditions were right — his great One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (名所江戸百景 Meisho Edo Hyakkei) was paid for up- front by a wealthy Buddhist priest in love with the daughter of the publisher, Uoya Eikichi (a former fishmonger). In 1856, Hiroshige \\"retired from the world,\\" becoming a Buddhist monk; this was the year he began his One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. He died aged 62 during the great Edo cholera epidemic of 1858 (whether the epidemic killed him is unknown) and was buried in a Zen Buddhist temple in Asakusa. Just before his death, he left a farewell poem: (The Western Land in this context refers to the strip of land by the Tōkaidō between Kyoto and Edo, but it does double duty as a reference to the paradise of the Amida Buddha). Despite his productivity and popularity, Hiroshige was not wealthy—his commissions were less than those of other in-demand artists, amounting to an income of about twice the wages of a day labourer. His will left instructions for the payment of his debts. Works A rather dark printing of the view sometimes dubbed \\"Man on Horseback Crossing a Bridge.\\" From the series The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō, this is View 28 and Station 27 at Nagakubo-shuku, depicting the Wada Bridge across the Yoda River. Hiroshige produced over 8,000 works. He largely confined himself in his early work to common ukiyo-e themes such as women (美人画 bijin-ga) and actors (役者絵 yakusha-e). Then, after the death of Toyohiro, Hiroshige made a dramatic turnabout, with the 1831 landscape series Famous Views of the Eastern Capital (東都名所 Tōto Meisho) which was critically acclaimed for its composition and colors. This set is generally distinguished from Hiroshige's many print sets depicting Edo by referring to it as Ichiyūsai Gakki, a title derived from the fact that he signed it as Ichiyūsai Hiroshige. With The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō (1833–1834), his success was assured. These designs were drawn from Hiroshige's actual travels of the full distance of . They included details of date, location, and anecdotes of his fellow travelers, and were immensely popular. In fact, this series was so popular that he reissued it in three versions, one of which was made jointly with Kunisada.Christine Guth, Art of Edo Japan: The Artist and the City, 1615–1868 (Harry Abrams, 1996). Hiroshige went on to produce more than 2000 different prints of Edo and post stations Tōkaidō, as well as series such as The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kisokaidō (1834–1842) and his own Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (1852–1858). Of his estimated total of 5000 designs, these landscapes comprised the largest proportion of any genre. He dominated landscape printmaking with his unique brand of intimate, almost small-scale works compared against the older traditions of landscape painting descended from Chinese landscape painters such as Sesshu. The travel prints generally depict travelers along famous routes experiencing the special attractions of various stops along the way. They travel in the rain, in snow, and during all of the seasons. In 1856, working with the publisher Uoya Eikichi, he created a series of luxury edition prints, made with the finest printing techniques including true gradation of color, the addition of mica to lend a unique iridescent effect, embossing, fabric printing, blind printing, and the use of glue printing (wherein ink is mixed with glue for a glittery effect). Hiroshige pioneered the use of the vertical format in landscape printing in his series Famous Views of the Sixty- odd Provinces. One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (issued serially between 1856 and 1859) was immensely popular. The set was published posthumously and some prints had not been completed — he had created over 100 on his own, but two were added by Hiroshige II after his death. Influence Keisai Eisen was influenced by and worked with Hiroshige. Oiwake, from The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō, 1830s Hiroshige was a member of the Utagawa school, along with Kunisada and Kuniyoshi. The Utagawa school comprised dozens of artists, and stood at the forefront of 19th century woodblock prints. Particularly noteworthy for their actor and historical prints, members of the Utagawa school were nonetheless well-versed in all of the popular genres. During Hiroshige’s time, the print industry was booming, and the consumer audience for prints was growing rapidly. Prior to this time, most print series had been issued in small sets, such as ten or twelve designs per series. Increasingly large series were produced to meet demand, and this trend can be seen in Hiroshige’s work, such as The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kisokaidō and One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. In terms of style, Hiroshige is especially noted for using unusual vantage points, seasonal allusions, and striking colors. In particular, he worked extensively within the realm of meisho-e (名所絵) pictures of famous places. During the Edo period, tourism was also booming, leading to increased popular interest in travel. Travel guides abounded, and towns appeared along routes such as the Tōkaidō, a road that connected Edo with Kyoto. In the midst of this burgeoning travel culture, Hiroshige drew upon his own travels, as well as tales of others’ adventures, for inspiration in creating his landscapes. For example, in The Fifty-three Stations on the Tōkaidō (1833), he illustrates anecdotes from Travels on the Eastern Seaboard (東海道中膝栗毛 Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige, 1802–1809) by Jippensha Ikku, a comedy describing the adventures of two bumbling travelers as they make their way along the same road. Hiroshige’s The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō (1833–1834) and One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (1856–1858) greatly influenced French Impressionists such as Monet. Vincent van Gogh copied two of the One Hundred Famous Views of Edo which were among his collection of ukiyo-e prints. Hiroshige's style also influenced the Mir iskusstva, a 20th-century Russian art movement in which Ivan Bilibin and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky were major artists. Dobuzhinsky confessed of Hiroshige's influence \\"I liked to choose a viewpoint of my own so that the composition would be striking, unusual; in that, I had the constant example of Hiroshige before my eyes\\". Cézanne and Whistler were also amongst those under Hiroshige's influence. Hiroshige was regarded by Louise Gonse, director of the influential Gazette des Beaux-Arts and author of the two volume L'Art Japonais in 1883, as the greatest painter of landscapes of the 19th century.

It is located near the River Stour. The closest town is Sudbury, Suffolk, approximately southeast of Borley; Sudbury is also the Post Town used by Royal Mail for Borley. The neighbouring parishes are Foxearth, Belchamp Walter and Bulmer. History The name Borley may be a compound of the Saxon words \\"Bap\\" and \\"Ley\\", that is \\"Boar's Pasture\\". Recent local research suggests that the name Borley may be derived from the Celtic ‘borle’, meaning ‘summer meadows’ which are still a prominent feature of the area. A smaller parish, Borley Parva, was joined with Foxearth in the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, the manor of Borley was held by a freeman called Lewin; by 1086, the Domesday Book records Borley manor in the hands of Adeliza, Countess of Albemarle (half-sister of William the Conqueror); it was subsequently transferred to Edward I. A document from 1308 sets out the 'Extent' of the manor, listing the main occupants and the rental income. Forty-six people are named in the extent: seven as free tenants, seven as molmen, 27 as villeins and five as cotemen – with an estimated population of 230. In 1346, the manor of Borley was transferred to the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury. From the 16th century, Borley was associated with the Waldegraves, one of the leading Essex Catholic families. Sir Edward Waldegrave, a courtier to Queen Mary, purchased the manor of Borley in 1546 and it became his principal residence. He died in the Tower of London in 1561 aged forty-four having fallen out of favour with Queen Elizabeth; his widow, Lady Frances Neville, later erected a monument to him and herself in Borley Church. From early times until local government reforms in 1894, Borley was one of the parishes in the Hinckford Hundred. It then became an area in Belchamp Rural District Council until that, in turn, was abolished in 1974 with the creation of Braintree District Council. Local government Due to its small population, decision-making at parish level is through a Parish Meeting open to all electors rather than an elected council. Borley is in part of England having two tiers of \\"principal\\" local authorities. It is one of 12 parishes making up Stour Valley North Ward, which is represented by a district councillor on Braintree District Council. It is also within the area of Essex County Council, represented by one county councillor as part of the Hedingham County Electoral Division. For elections to the UK Parliament, Borley is in the constituency of Braintree. Natural and built environment Borley consists of three clusters of buildings: one closest to the River Stour, including the village hall; one around the parish church; and a third at Borley Green. In 2012, there were 89 voting residents in a total of around 110, occupying 49 dwellings. Borley is notable for the high proportion of Listed Buildings. There are 15 Grade II listed houses, including Borley Hall (the fragment of a once much larger house), Borley Place (at one time the rectory) and Borley Lodge. The Grade I listed church (dedication unknown) is a small building of stone originally in the Romanesque/Early English style of the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Pevsner notes that a \\"topiary walk to the porch is the most notable feature of the church\\". There is no \\"defined village envelop\\" and therefore for planning purposes, Borley and Borely Green (an area of grassland owned by Braintree District Council) are considered to be \\"countryside\\". Borley is located within Natural England's South Suffok and North Essex Clayland National Character Area, with \\"an ancient landscape of wooded arable countryside with a distinct sense of enclosure\\". Borley in popular culture During the 20th century, Borley became well known for the 'Borley Rectory Affair', involving the supposed haunting of a Victorian rectory (now demolished). Beginning in 1929, psychical researcher Harry Price generated a story that captured the attention of the nation and convinced many of the proof of the permanence of the spirit after death. His supposed activities were reported widely by the press of that time, and Price published several popular books on the subject that brought him considerable fame. After Price's death, the story began to unravel under the scrutiny of experts from the Society for Psychical Research. The Society went through the records with great tenacity, suspecting that Price had exaggerated evidence to sensationalise events and to suggest supernatural causes for mundane phenomena. Any possible evidence of ghosts was irredeemably contaminated by Price's behaviour and the manipulation of the facts in his two books, The Most Haunted House in England and The End of Borley Rectory, produced during and immediately after the Second World War.

He is believed to be a great-grandson of Jan Popel z Lobkowicz. Life He was a precocious child, early delving into serious problems in mathematics and even publishing astronomical tables at the age of ten. After receiving a superficial education at college, where his unusual ability brought rapid advancement, this prodigy turned his attention to the Asiatic languages, especially Chinese. He was received into the Cistercian Order at the monastery of La Espina, in the diocese of Palencia, and after ordination entered upon a varied and brilliant career. His sermons attracted the favorable attention of the Infante Ferdinand, Governor of the Low Countries, while he was attached to the monastery of Dunes in Flanders, and in 1638 he was honored with the degree of Doctor of Theology by the University of Leuven. When he was obliged to leave the Electorate of the Palatinate, Philip IV of Spain made him his envoy to the court of Emperor Ferdinand III. He was in turn Abbot of Melrose, Scotland (Scotland), Abbot-Superior of the Benedictines of Vienna, and Grand-Vicar to the Archbishop of Prague. In 1648, when the Swedes attacked Prague, he armed and led a band of ecclesiastics who did yeoman service in the defence of the city. His bravery on this occasion merited for him a collar of gold from the emperor. Soon after he became Bishop of Satrianum, then Campagna, and at his death was Bishop of Vigevano. Caramuel was in active epistolary relations with the most famous scholars of the time:Ares, J., Lara, J., Lizcano, D. et al. Who Discovered the Binary System and Arithmetic? Did Leibniz Plagiarize Caramuel?, Sci. Eng. Ethics (2018) 24: 173-188. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-017-9890-6 the philosophers René Descartes and Pierre Gassendi; the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher; the Czech Capuchin friar and astronomer Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita, the Bohemian doctor Jan Marek Marci, Pope Alexander VII (Fabio Chigi), who was a great admirer of his work; the Belgian astronomer Godefroy Wendelin, the theologians Franciscus Bonae Spei and Antonino Diana, Giovanni Battista Hodierna, Johannes Hevelius, Valerianus Magnus, Juan Eusebio Nieremberg and many others. Works Hatching table printed by Lobkowitz in 1636 The facade of the Vigevano Cathedral (in Italy) was designed and built by Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz His books are even more numerous than his titles and his varied achievements; for, according to Jean-Noël Paquot, he published no fewer than 262 works on grammar, poetry, oratory, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, physics, politics, canon law, logic, metaphysics, theology and asceticism. He loved to defend novel theories, and in Theologia moralis ad prima atque clarissima principia reducta (Leuven, 1643) tried to solve theological problems by mathematical rules. He was a leading exponent of probabilism and his permissive moral opinions were criticized in Pascal's Provincial Letters and gained for him from Alphonsus Liguori the title of \\"Prince of the Laxists\\". His mathematical work centred on combinatorics and he was one of the early writers on probability, republishing Huygens's work on dice with helpful explanations.The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal, James Franklin, JHU Press, 2015, Caramuel's Mathesis biceps presents some original contributions to the field of mathematics: he proposed a new method of approximation for trisecting an angle and proposed a form of logarithm that prefigure cologarithms, although he was not understood by his contemporaries.Juan Vernet, Dictionary of Scientific Biography [1971], cited in Jens Høyrup, Barocco e scienza secentesca: un legame inesistente?, published in Analecta Romana Instituti Danici, 25 (1997), 141-172. Caramuel was also the first mathematician who made a reasoned study on non-decimal counts, thus making a significant contribution to the development of the binary numeral system. The Cardinal was also responsible for the design of the facade of the Vigevano Cathedral.

With a population (2016) of 48,009, it is the third municipality of the province after Catania and Acireale. History The site of Paternò was settled before 3500 BCE. Its inhabitants were probably the Sicani, although it was located in mainly Sicel territory; its initial name was Inessa. The modern name derives form the Greek Paeter Aitnaion, meaning the \\"Fortress of the Etnaeans\\". The presence of another town, called Hybla Major or Galeatis, is attested north west to the current town. A centre of medium importance in the Greek and Roman eras, it was largely depopulated in the three centuries before 1000 AD; during the subsequent Arab domination of Sicily, it was known as Batarnù. After the Norman conquest in the 1040s, it was renamed Paternionis and began a period of flourishing. It was here that King Frederick III of Sicily created the Camera Reginale (\\"Queen's Chamber\\") as a wedding gift for his wife Eleanor of Anjou, and this was inherited by the subsequent Queens of Sicily. This period of splendour for Paternò lasted until the 15th century, when it became a fief and in consequence slowly lost importance. Historically, the area around Paternò was plagued by malaria, caused by the marshlands of the Plain of Catania. This has since long been remedied, and the urban development of the town enjoyed a large acceleration in the 1960s and 1970s. Geography Paternò borders with the municipalities of Belpasso, Biancavilla, Catenanuova (EN), Centuripe (EN), Ragalna, Ramacca and Santa Maria di Licodia. Its only hamlet (frazione) is the village of Sferro. Within Paterno there is a geologic feature named 'Salinelle', a place where small mud volcanoes emerge from cracks in the ground. This area in which the Salinelle surfaces includes an archeological site currently uncovering evidence of Roman baths previously built on and thought to have used the Salinelle mud. Main sights *The Norman Castle, built in 1072 by order of Roger I of Sicily. *Mother Church (Chiesa Madre di Santa Maria dell'Alto), built in 1342 and largely modified in the early 18th century.

The tran station was originally used mostly for food transportation, and is not out of service. The main passenger station is part of the narrow gauge Ferrovia Circumetnea. The latter also provides a regular bus service to destination on the Catania-Adrano line.

Occurrence Eskolaite mineral occurs naturally as the mineral eskolaite, which is found in chromium-rich tremolite skarns, metaquartzites, and chlorite veins. Eskolaite is also a rare component of chondrite meteorites. The mineral is named after Finnish geologist Pentti Eskola.

The conversion of chromite to chromia proceeds via , which is reduced with sulfur at high temperatures:Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, \\"Chromium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. : + S → + The oxide is also formed by the decomposition of chromium salts such as chromium nitrate, or by the exothermic decomposition of ammonium dichromate. : → + + 4 The reaction has a low ignition temperature of less than 200 °C and is frequently used in “volcano” demonstrations. Applications Because of its considerable stability, chromia is a commonly used pigment. It was originally called viridian. It is used in paints, inks, and glasses.

Early life and career Anatole Dauman was born in Warsaw in 1925 to a Russian Jewish family and later emigrated to France. In 1951, he formed Argos Films with Philippe Lifchitz. It was a niche production company with the aim of making films on art which were inspired by the work of the Italian documentary filmmaker Luciano Emmer. Dauman produced the first films of Pierre Kast, Jean Aurel and Chris Marker. In 1953, they gained an advance from a distributor that enabled them to produce Alexander Astruc's Crimson Curtain, which received a prime a la qualite. After that they produced Alain Resnais' Night and Fog and two films by Chris Marker, Sunday in Peking and Letter from Siberia. In 1959, Argos initiated the production of Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour. They also produced Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad. They also produced Chronique d'un été (Chronicle of a Summer) by Jean Rouch and the sociologist Edgar Morin, a documentary which pioneered cinéma vérité.

It is the administrative headquarter of Patuakhali district and one of the oldest towns and municipalities in the country. Patuakhali municipality was established in 1892. The town covers an area of 27.03 km² with a population of 65,000 according to 2011 census. Title There are different opinions about the origin of the name \\"Patuakhali\\". The general belief is that the name is derived from Bengali name \\"Patuar Khal\\" (Canal of Patua) which flows down the present Patuakhali municipality connecting the Bay of Bengal. It is said that at the beginning of the 17th century the Portuguese pirates used to make regular incursions to this area through this canal. The local people named it \\"Patuar Khal\\" which is now called \\"Patuakhali. Austric origin people are probably the first that settled in this region.  History  Historically, Patuakhali was part of Chandradwip kingdom in the fourteenth century. The present town was then full of jungle and along the river-side a small market used to meet once a week. During British rule in Bengal, the land of Patuakhali town was owned by a landlord family. A civil court with a Judge was set up in 1868 and Patuakhali was established a subdivision of then Barisal District in 1871 by the help of Brajamohan Dutta. On the northern bank of the river, in the village Laukathi, were the tahsil cutcheries of the principal landlords of the subdivision. With the influx of population from the districts of Dhaka, Faridpur and Barisal a good market, a middle English school and a charitable dispensary were gradually established and trading firms opened up business. The high school and the Begum Hospital were probably the most important public institution in the town that time. The high school was established in 1887 and a hostel attached to the school in 1904. The hospital was established in 1872, and was provided with a new building in 1904, the entire cost being borne by the late Nawab Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah Bahadur of Dacca. The hospital is called the Begum Hospital after the Nawab's wife. Rice, firewood, coarse cloth made by the local weavers and hogla mats were the chief items of trade. A hosiery factory was established in 1911-12. Patuakhali was constituted a municipality on 1 April 1892. The Commissioners were at first nominated, but the elective system was introduced in 1900s. The Local Board was established in 1871. The area within the municipal limits was Climate Sports  Cricket and football are the two most popular sports in Patuakhali while local games like Kabaddi, Kho kho, Lathi Khela are also popular. There is a local stadium in the town known as Patuakhali District Stadium. It is used for hosting local sports and national events. Notable players from Patuakhali who have played for the national team include Sohag Gazi.  Education  Patuakhali town is a home to many educational institutions. Patuakhali Government Jubilee High School is the oldest and a renowned school in Bangladesh. It was established in 1876 as Patuakhali Entrance School by the local honorable personalities and officials. In 1884 the then SDO, Mr. Foyz Uddin Hossen allotted a new place and made a one storied brick building with the help of the government and money from the local people. In 1887, the school was moved to new place and renamed as \\"Patuakhali Jubilee High English School\\" as a memorandum of the ceremony of Queen Victoria's ascension to the throne. Then again Patuakhali Collectorate School and College was formed with SDO building as the center. There is a science and technology university for higher education in Patukhali 15 km away from the town. There are notable colleges and schools in the town which includes: Patuakhali Medical College, Patuakhali Government College, Patuakhali Government Women's College, Latif Municipal Seminary, Patuakhali Town High School, Patuakhali Government Girls' High School, Sreerampur Secondary School, Wazedabad Mustafavia Fazil Madrasa etc. Besides these, there are two teacher training colleges, a Government Polytechnic institute and a vocational institute in the town. The educational activities are operated under the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Barisal.  Religion  The majority of Patuakhali's people are Muslims (86.09%), other religious groups include Hindus (13.83%), and very few numbers of other religions, mainly Christians (0.01%) and Buddhists (0.07%).  Transport and communications  The main transport systems used in the town are cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws, buses, mini-buses, bikes and cars. Patuakhali can be reached by road and waterways. There is a bus station at Choumohoni a few kilometers away from the town and a launch terminal located at the other end which maintains communication with Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. There is no railway in this region.

His ancestors with German surnames Wiesner actually came from Austrian which had migrated to Malacky before the unification of the two Kingdoms. During 1908 to 1913 Wiesner studied at the Technical College and the Academy of Arts (taught by B. Ohmann) in Vienna. After the World War I he worked as an independent architect in the city of Brno, until 1939. Wiesner was a very active architect in the city between the World Wars. His work was greatly influenced by Adolf Loos and his pure constructions with their classicized balance and monumentality are amongst the best works to be constructed in Brno at that time. Afterwards Wiesner emigrated to Great Britain where he joins the foreign anti-fascist resistance. After World War II he stayed in England. During 1948-50 he acted as a lecturer in the School of Architecture at the University of Oxford and during 1950-60 at the University of Liverpool. In 1969 he was nominated to the rank of honorary doctor by the University of Jan Evangelista Purkyně (now Masaryk University) in Brno. When he died in 1971 he was buried in Liverpool's Allerton Cemetery.

Located at the intersection of 34th Street and Seventh Avenue, it is served by the 1 and 2 trains at all times, and the 3 train at all times except late nights. Connections are available to the LIRR, NJ Transit and Amtrak at Pennsylvania Station. History 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line was opened on June 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the dominant subway in Manhattan at the time, from Times Square–42nd Street to South Ferry. It was served by a shuttle train to Times Square until the rest of the extension opened a year later on July 1, 1918. This meant that the subway would be expanded down the Lower West Side to neighborhoods such as Greenwich Village and the western portion of the Financial District. As part of this and the northern IRT Lexington Avenue Line extension, the IRT network would be radically changed from an S-shaped line connecting the eastern side of Lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side to an H-shaped network with two parallel lines, the East and West Side Lines, and a shuttle at 42nd Street connecting them. On August 23, 1985, the MTA awarded a $2.24 million contract to rebuild the station and to double the width of the passageway to Penn Station. The project was scheduled to be completed in spring 1987. Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station, along with thirty-two other New York City Subway stations, underwent a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. Unlike other stations that were renovated under the initiative, 34th Street–Penn Station was not completely closed during construction. In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting receive the $125 million contract for the renovations of 57th and 23rd Streets on the IND Sixth Avenue Line; 28th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line. However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts. The contract was put back for a vote in February, where it was ultimately approved. These improvements were substantially completed by May 2019. Station layout Trim line tablets Name on trim line Like 34th Street–Penn Station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line and Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, this station has two side platforms for local service and a center island platform for express service. This is due to the expected increase in ridership and to encourage riders to switch at the next stop northbound, Times Square–42nd Street, as it is set up in the usual island platform manner for cross-platform interchanges. There is no free transfer between this station and the station of the same name on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, despite the fact that both connect to Penn Station. The nearest transfer location is at Times Square–42nd Street with a free transfer to 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal. =Exits= 34th Street entrance 34th Street–Penn Station spans three streets (32nd, 33rd, and 34th Streets) with a set of entrances/exits at all of these streets. For the purposes of this article, entrance and exit are interchangeable. * 34th Street: There are four entrances directly from the intersection of 34th Street and Seventh Avenue. On the local platforms the turnstiles for these exits are at platform level; passengers wishing to use the express platforms must use a passageway beneath the platforms and tracks. These entrances utilize the northern portions of the platforms. There is also a supplementary and handicapped-accessible entrance to the Penn Station complex in general from 34th Street. * 33rd Street: There are three direct entrances from the street at 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue. As a replacement for the southwestern corner's lack of an entrance, there is an underground entrance directly connecting the station with the Long Island Rail Road concourse in the Penn Station complex. The turnstiles for this entrance are located below the track level and utilize the central portions of the platforms. * 32nd Street: The main entrance to the Penn Station complex is located on the western end of 32nd Street. From there, passengers may go through the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road concourses and use the entrance to this station at the end of the latter's concourse. There is also a smaller exit from the station at the southern ends of the platforms that connects with the end of the New Jersey Transit concourse where it meets the Long Island Rail Road underneath the main corridor in the station that connects New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. There is also an entrance on the north side of 32nd Street between Seventh and Sixth Avenues. Ridership 34th Street–Penn Station on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line is continually ranked as one of the busiest stations in the subway system. In 2016, it was the fifth-busiest subway station, with 27,741,367 riders as recorded by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. By comparison, its sister station on the Eighth Avenue Line is ranked sixth-busiest, with 25,183,869 passengers. When the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station was a shuttle stop before the rest of the South Ferry extension opened, ridership was quite low; in its first year of operation, only 78,121 boardings were recorded.

In the Orthodox Church, she is venerated as St. Anastasia the Pharmakolytria, i.e. \\"Deliverer from Potions\\" ().http://www.antiochian.org/node/17101 Concerning Anastasia little is reliably known, save that she died in the persecutions of Diocletian; most stories about her date from several centuries after her death and make her variously a Roman or Sirmian native and a Roman citizen of patrician rank. One legend makes her the daughter of a certain Praetextatus and the pupil of Saint Chrysogonus. Catholic tradition states that her mother was St. Fausta of Sirmium. Anastasia has long been venerated as a healer and exorcist. Her relics lie in the Cathedral of St. Anastasia in Zadar, Croatia. She is one of seven women who, along with the Blessed Virgin Mary, are commemorated by name in the Roman Canon of the Mass. Legend Prior to the liturgical reforms of the twentieth century, this martyr enjoyed the distinction, unique in the Roman liturgy, of having a special commemoration in the second Mass on Christmas Day. This daytime Mass was originally celebrated not in honor of the birth of Christ but rather in commemoration of this martyr, and towards the end of the 5th century, her name was also inserted in the Roman Canon. Nevertheless, she is not a Roman saint, for she suffered martyrdom at Sirmium, and was not venerated at Rome until almost the end of the 5th century. A \\"Passio\\" not earlier than the 6th century, gives a legendary account which makes Anastasia a Roman, without, however, claiming that she suffered martyrdom at Rome. The same legend connects her name with that of St. Chrysogonus, likewise in truth not a Roman martyr, but put to death in Aquileia, though the San Crisogono church in Rome is dedicated to him. A scale model of Sirmium in Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia The legend already mentioned makes Anastasia the daughter of Praetextatus, a Roman vir illustris, and affirms that she had Chrysogonus for a teacher. Early in the persecution of Diocletian, the Emperor summoned Chrysogonus to Aquileia where he suffered martyrdom. Anastasia, having gone from Aquileia to Sirmium to visit the faithful of that place, was beheaded on the island of Palmaria, 25 December, and her body interred in the house of Apollonia, which had been converted into a basilica. The whole account is purely legendary and rests on no historical foundations. All that is certain is that a martyr named Anastasia gave her life for the faith in Sirmium and that her memory was kept in that city. In Rome, a church in ancient times bore the name of a certain Anastasia and is listed under the name titulus Anastasiae in the acts of the 499 Roman synods. At some point in history, this church came to be seen as dedicated to this martyr of the same name. It has the rank of a basilica and is one of the titular churches of Rome assigned to a cardinal-priest.  Basilica  Saint Anastasia was built in the late 3rd century - early 4th century, possibly by a Roman woman named Anastasia. Later the church was entitled to the martyr with the same name, Anastasia of Sirmium. Veneration Great Martyr Anastasia, the Deliverer from Potions (Byzantine icon, 14th-15th century, State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia). =In the West= The Martyrologium Hieronymianumed. De Rossi and Duchesne, Acta Sanctorum, 2 November. records her name on 25 December, not for Sirmium alone, but also for Constantinople, a circumstance based on a separate story. According to Theodorus Lector,Hist. Eccles., II, 65. during the patriarchate of Gennadius (458-471) the body of the martyr was transferred to Constantinople and interred in a church which had hitherto been known as \\"Anastasis\\" (Gr. Anastasis, Resurrection); thenceforth the church took the name of Anastasia. Similarly St. Anastasia was introduced into Rome from Sirmium by means of an already existing church. As this church was already quite famous, it brought the feast day of the saint into especial prominence. There existed in Rome from the 4th century, at the foot of the Palatine Hill and above the Circus Maximus, a church which had been adorned by Pope Damasus (366-384) with a large mosaic. It was known as \\"titulus Anastasiae\\", and is mentioned as such in the Acts of the Roman Council of 499. There is some uncertainty as to the origin of this name; either the church owes its foundation to and was named after a Roman matron Anastasia, as in the case of several other titular churches of Rome (Duchesne), or it was originally an \\"Anastasis\\" church (dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ), such as existed already at Ravenna and Constantinople; from the word \\"Anastasis\\" came eventually the name \\"titulus Anastasiae\\" (Grisar). Whatever way this happened, the church was an especially prominent one from the fourth to the 6th century, being the only titular church in the centre of ancient Egypt and surrounded by the monuments of the city's pagan past. Within its jurisdiction was the Palatine where the imperial court was located. Since the veneration of the Sirmian martyr, Anastasia, received a new impetus in Constantinople during the second half of the 5th century, we may easily infer that the intimate contemporary relations between Old and New Rome brought about an increase in devotion to St. Anastasia at the foot of the Palatine. At all events the insertion of her name into the Roman Canon of the Mass towards the end of the 5th century, show that she then occupied a unique position among the saints publicly venerated at Rome. Thenceforth the church on the Palatine is known as \\"titulus sanctae Anastasiae\\", and the martyr of Sirmium became the titular saint of the old 4th-century basilica. Evidently because of its position as titular church of the district including the imperial dwellings on the Palatine this church long maintained an eminent rank among the churches of Rome; only two churches preceded it in honour: St. John Lateran, the mother- church of Rome, and Santa Maria Maggiore. This ancient sanctuary stands today quite isolated amid the ruins of Rome. The commemoration of St. Anastasia in the second Mass on Christmas Day is the last remnant of the former prominence enjoyed by this saint and her church in the life of Christian Rome. According to tradition, St. Donatus of Zadar brought Anastasia's relics to Zadar from Constantinople, when he was there with the Venetian duke Beato. They had been ordered by Charlemagne to negotiate the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Croatian territories that were under the dominion of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire. =In the East= The Orthodox Church venerates St. Anastasia as a Great Martyr, usually referring to her as \\"Anastasia the Deliverer from Potions\\", \\"Anastasia the Healer\\" or \\"Anastasia of Sirmium\\". She is often given the epithets, \\"Deliverer from Bonds\\" and \\"Deliverer from Potions\\", because her intercessions are credited with the protection of the faithful from poison and other harmful substances. Her feast day is celebrated on December 22 on the Eastern Orthodox Church calendar. According to the Synaxarion, she was the daughter of Praepextatus (a pagan) and Fausta (a Christian) In the 5th century the relics of St Anastasia were transferred to Constantinople, where a church was built and dedicated to her. Later, the relics, including her skull, were transferred to the Monastery of St. Anastasia the Pharmokolitria, Chalkidiki of Greece, near Mount Athos. In 2012, the relics were stolen and have not been recovered.http://www.pravoslavie.ru/79427.html See also * Saint Anastasia of Sirmium, patron saint archive NotesExternal links *Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Anastasia *Patron Saints: Anastasia *Greatmartyr Anastasia the \\"Deliverer from Potions\\" Orthodox Synaxarion and icon of the saint * \\"Saint Anastasia\\" at the Christian Iconography website *\\"Historia de Sancta Anastasia\\" (in Latin), from Jacobus de Voragine, Legenda Aurea. * Translation of the above, by Richard Stracke Category:4th-century Christian saints Category:Nativity of Jesus in worship and liturgy Category:Wonderworkers Category:Illyrian people Category:People from Sremska Mitrovica Category:Late Ancient Christian female saints Category:304 deaths Category:Sirmium ","title":"Anastasia of Sirmium"},{"id":"2492621","text":"recyclables in Stellenbosch Pronunciation of \\"Bergie\\".

Loder (7 April 1946 – 12 August 2005) was an English sound engineer, record producer and founder of Southern Studios, as well as a former member of EXIT and co-founder of the Southern Records distribution company with his wife Sue. He was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass and Crass Records, and was often considered to be the band's \\"ninth member\\". Loder was born near Plymouth and educated at boarding school before studying electrical engineering at London's City University. During his post-graduate work there, he became involved in early experiments in digital encoding of audio for the military. By 1970 he had joined EXIT, alongside Penny Rimbaud, utilising a one-track tape-recorder. This led to Loder eventually founding a record studio in his garage after the disbanding of EXIT in 1974. Loder was recording advertising jingles in 1977 when his path crossed once again with Rimbaud, who had by then co-founded Crass, and invited Loder to become the band's engineer and financial manager, roles Loder happily accepted. When Crass founded their own record label, Loder worked as an engineer on most of the label's releases, and when Loder saw potential in a number of bands turned away by Crass Records, Loder set up Southern Records. Loder engineered and produced for many bands other than Crass, among them the Jesus and Mary Chain (for whom he engineered the recordings of the Psychocandy album), Big Black (Songs About Fucking), PJ Harvey, Babes in Toyland, Fugazi, Ministry and Shellac. In the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern. Its notable output included the music show Snub TV, which after first being syndicated nationwide in the USA, went on to further success on BBC2 and in other countries. Loder was responsible for encouraging and establishing independent alternative ezines, donating the use of Southern's servers and bandwidth, taking part in pioneering online media streaming and simulcasting.

In 2006, it was released for Japanese mobile phones through Namco Bandai Games' mobile game service. Gameplay As in many other vertical scrolling shooters (including Namco's own Xevious), the player controls a ship, facing the top of the screen, that can move freely while the background scrolls down, bringing enemies into view; the player may destroy enemies for points. The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers. Even though the game is the sequel to Bosconian (which used a synthesized, DAC-generated voice saying \\"Blast off!\\" at the beginning of every round), Blast Off had more in common gameplay-wise with Namco's own Dragon Spirit than with Bosconian; this is especially noticeable in the third area of every world, where the player's ship undergoes an increase in size, and must destroy a boss. Despite several gameplay differences, the connection with Bosconian was emphasized in the marketing of the game, with the hexagonal space stations from Bosconian appearing in Namco's press literature, and on the game's title screen, and also making appearances in the game itself - and the game is also worth noting for its usages of various Engrish phrases, such as \\"To push start only 1 player button\\" (on title screen), \\"Go next\\" (at end of world), \\"Congraturations\\" (at end of game) and \\"Entry your name\\" (on high score table). There are a total of six worlds in this game, and each one has three areas (so there are a total of eighteen \\"stages\\" to play through).

Upbringing  Henry (sometimes known as \\"Harry\\") Haydn Jones was born in Ruthin, Wales. He was the son of Joseph David Jones (1827–70), a schoolmaster in the town and a respected Welsh musician and composer. After the early death of his father, Haydn Jones was brought up by uncles at Towyn (now called Tywyn) where he was educated at the Board School & Academy. In 1903 he married Barbara Annie Gwendolen Davies Jones, daughter of Lewis D. Jones, a Welsh-born Chicago ironmonger and quarry owner.  Politics  In 1889 Haydn Jones was elected as one of the first members of Merionethshire County Council, representing the Towyn Urban District. A year later he was the chair of the council. He was eventually elected an Alderman. Jones continued to rise in the political world being elected as the MP for Merioneth at the January 1910 general election. He continued to serve in this role until 1945 general election, when aged 81. He was knighted in 1937.  Business  In 1909 the Bryn Eglwys slate quarry, the Abergynolwyn estate and village and Talyllyn Railway came up for sale. Aware of the distress which would be caused by permanent closure of the quarry Sir Haydn bought the lot himself in 1911 for £5250, and became the sole owner of what became the Abergynolwyn Slate and Slab Company. In 1935 he extended his quarry ownership, leasing the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry in the neighbouring Corris district. The quarrying and slate business did well until the early 1920s when demand fell and the Bryn Eglwys quarry was only kept open by pillaring the easy to obtain slate rather than by digging out new underground chambers. At times there was a three-day week, but the quarry soldiered on until 1941 when Sir Haydn's lease expired. He continued on a yearly lease until 1946 when a roof fall caused by the continued pillaring closed the quarry for good.  Talyllyn Railway  By buying Bryn Eglwys, Haydn Jones had become effectively owner of the Talyllyn Railway built to carry slate from the quarry to Tywyn. After the quarry collapse and closure in 1946, the railway had little reason to continue operating. Haydn Jones declared that the railway would remain open while he remained alive and it continued to run until 1950. After his death his widow reached an arrangement with L. T. C. Rolt and his associates allowing them to lease the railway, which continues operating to this day. One of the Talyllyn locomotives, ex-Corris Railway No.3, was named Sir Haydn after him in 1951. This was more appropriate than was known at the time, as Sir Haydn's strong support of the Corris Railway during his time as lessee of Aberllefenni Quarry was instrumental in the railway continuing to operate throughout World War Two and the locomotive therefore avoiding the wartime scrap drive. It is in his role as owner of the Talyllyn Railway that Sir Haydn Jones became a figure known, albeit not by name, to many small children. One of the early railway preservation people who joined Rolt was the Rev. W.V. Awdry, and in the form of the owner of the Skarloey Railway, Sir Haydn was immortalised in his books as Sir Handel Brown. As in real life, loco No.3 on the Skarloey Railway was named after him as Sir Handel.

History The club opened on 29 May 1874 with the aim to be available to both men and women. It formed under a committee formed of both sexes, under the presidency of James Stansfeld, Member of Parliament for Halifax. It had initially set the limit for members at 600, with some 350 elected two weeks prior to opening. The club came in for criticism because of its progressive view of women's rights, but also saw supporters join its ranks such as Edward Cortenay MP. However, it was not immediately popular and by January 1879, it had to raise the subscription fees in order to make up the shortfall due to the lack of numbers. A year later, it was said to have suffered from more withdrawals than new admissions and this was blamed on the poor quality of the food being served there. However, by the end of the decade, memberships had reached 600 and the club was considering moving to larger premises.

On 28 February 1895, the club became notorious for being the location of the incident that began the first trial of Oscar Wilde, who was a member of the Albermarle. The Marquess of Queensberry burst into the club, demanding to see Wilde. His entry was blocked by the porter, so instead Queensberry left a calling card with the note \\"For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite\\" (sic). This resulted in Wilde's failed libel action and subsequent criminal prosecution. At the turn of the 20th century, the club remained successful with vacancies only usually arising through the deaths of current members. Because of the club's prominent place in the proceedings, and its being named at the trial, it fell into disrepute. Seeking to distance itself, it moved into Ely House at 37 Dover Street in 1909. The site underwent a refit in 1910 to make the premises better suited to the club; it had previously been used as a residence for the Bishop of Ely.

At the time of her death, she was the richest woman in Spain and the world's richest self-made woman. In 1975, she co- founded the Zara retail chain with her then-husband Amancio Ortega Gaona. The company grew to become the world's largest fashion retailer. Early life and education Rosalia Mera was born in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain in 1944.

Ten years after the opening of the first Zara store, Inditex was established as a holding company for the couple's businesses. Inditex now comprises multiple fashion companies, of which Zara is the flagship. The company also owns the retailers Bershka, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Pull & Bear, Stradivarius, Uterque and Zara Home.

It is based upon his comic strip of the same name. The series premiered on November 6, 2005. The show begins with a black family, the Freemans, settling into the fictional, friendly and overall white suburb of Woodcrest. The perspective offered by this mixture of cultures, lifestyles, social classes, stereotypes, viewpoints and racialized identities provides for much of the series' satire, comedy, and conflict. The series ended its run on June 23, 2014 with a total of 55 episodes over the course of the show's four seasons, the last of which was produced without any involvement from McGruder. The series also has aired in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media. On June 12, 2019, it was announced that Sony Pictures Animation would be producing a reboot of the television series set to premiere in 2020 with McGruder's involvement; John Witherspoon was also attached to the project to reprise his role as Robert Freeman before his passing on October 29, 2019. On September 18, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had picked up the reboot with a two-season order. Each season is set to consist of twelve episodes.  Development and production  The Boondocks began as a comic strip on Hitlist.com, one of the first online music websites. The strip later found its way into The Source magazine. Following these runs, McGruder began simultaneously pitching The Boondocks as both a syndicated comic strip and an animated television series. The former goal was met first, and The Boondocks debuted in newspapers in April 1999. In the meantime, the development of the TV series continued. McGruder and film producer/director Reginald Hudlin (President of Entertainment for BET from 2005 to 2008) created a Boondocks pilot for the Fox Network, but found great difficulty in making the series acceptable for network television. Hudlin left the project after the Fox deal fell through, though McGruder and Sony Television were contractually obligated to credit him as an executive producer for the first two seasons. Mike Lazzo, president of Adult Swim and executive producer for Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Space Ghost Coast to Coast, stumbled across the pilot and declared it \\"too networky\\". He then ordered a 15-episode season and told McGruder to \\"just tell stories\\". The series has a loose connection with the continuity of the comic strip, though during the final year of the strip McGruder made a point to try to synchronize them. He introduced Uncle Ruckus into the strip, and the comic-strip version of Riley's hair was braided into cornrows to match the character's hair in the series. During Season 1, McGruder put the strip on a 6-month hiatus beginning in March 2006. He did not return to the strip the following November, and the strip's syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, announced that it had been canceled. The opening theme song used in the series (slightly remixed for Season 2 and 3) is performed by hip-hop artist Asheru. The series was produced in widescreen since the beginning, but the image was cropped to accommodate the 4:3 aspect ratio at the time of their original broadcasts as well as reruns. Adult Swim rarely crops widescreen material. Since the third season, the series has been produced in 16:9 high definition and presented in its original aspect ratio and resolution. In 2014, it was announced that McGruder would not be involved in the show's fourth season. Adult Swim stated, \\"a mutually agreeable production schedule could not be determined.\\" The season premiered on April 21, 2014, ending its run on June 23, 2014. At Annecy 2019, Sony Pictures Animation announced it would be producing a \\"reimagining\\" of the television series. On June 12, 2019, a reboot of the series was officially announced with McGruder and voice actor John Witherspoon confirmed to be returning from the original series, before his death on October 29, 2019. On September 18, 2019, it was announced that the reboot will stream on HBO Max in fall 2020. The service has ordered two seasons, 24 episodes total with a 50-minute special. The complete run of the original 2005 series was also made available on the service.  Setting  The series opens with the Freemans settling into the fictional, peaceful, and mostly white suburb of Woodcrest. Evidence for the real-world location of the fictional Woodcrest is mixed. Proponents of the Chicago's South Side theory cite the real-life suburb of Crestwood, Illinois and the similarity of the two names. The first season features several Chicago landmarks: a skyline shot showing the Willis Tower, Grant Park, buildings of the Michigan Avenue Historic District, and Lake Michigan; as well as elevated rapid transit endemic to the city, resembling the Chicago \\"L\\". More conclusive evidence is presented in \\"The Trial of Robert Kelly\\", in which Riley asks Grandad, \\"Can you take us into the City tomorrow to watch the R. Kelly Trial?\\". Grandad denies his request and tells him to walk, and Riley replies \\"But it's 40 miles!\\" R. Kelly is from Chicago, and his trial was held there, giving more evidence that The Boondocks is in fact set in Illinois. Another reference to Chicago is Martin Luther King Drive, a major street running through South Chicago, mentioned for its violent activity in the 9th episode of season 1, \\"Return of the King\\". Additionally, in \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\", Ed Wuncler III, Gin Rummy and Riley go to Oprah Winfrey's television studio in an attempt to kidnap her. The Oprah Winfrey Show was recorded at Harpo Studios in Near West Side Chicago. Proponents of the Columbia, Maryland theory, cite other evidence, such as McGruder's own childhood there, where his father worked for the National Transportation Safety Board. In the comics, Huey's cellphone number has a 443 area code, which belongs to the Baltimore metropolitan area. In \\"Wingmen\\", the Freemans fly 'home' to Chicago, where they lived before moving to Woodcrest, to attend a funeral. In \\"The Fried Chicken Flu,\\" a reporter on a passing television screen reports on the titular disease's effect on the state of Maryland. In addition, in Season 4's first episode, \\"Pretty Boy Flizzy,\\" a man references an upcoming concert at Woodcrest Post Pavilion, which may be a play on Columbia's notable concert venue Merriweather Post Pavilion.  Characters  * Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – 10-year-old Huey Freeman is the family's moral compass and voice of reason. He is an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years avid reader who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects. He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left-wing social movements and social justice leaders. His brother and grandfather constantly ridicule and underestimate him, thinking he is a fool to have goals and values that aim higher than the expectations of mainstream American culture. It is mentioned that he has been declared a \\"domestic terrorist\\". While he promotes various social causes, he is openly contemptuous of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop as portrayed in mainstream media for glamorizing wasteful extravagance, self-defeating lifestyles, and ignorance. Huey, unlike the other characters, rarely smiles; in the episode \\"Let's Nab Oprah\\" he smiles after his duel with Riley; he also smiles when Riley begins to win basketball games in \\"Ballin'\\". He is a highly skilled kung-fu fighter, and beats Riley with ease in all of their fights. He has only lost to a few opponents. * Riley Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – Riley Freeman is Huey's mischievous, rebellious 8-year-old brother, an enthusiastic follower of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop. Though he is otherwise charming, clever, and artistically gifted, Riley maintains loyalty to those Gangster Rap ideals, even in the face of their self-destructive consequences. In \\"The Fundraiser\\" Huey tries to warn him directly about the foregone conclusions of his poor decisions, but Riley offhandedly rebuffs him. The bulk of the series focuses on Riley's misadventures (most of which are fueled by his love of gangsta rap and a desire to emulate other people he admires) or on his various outlandish schemes, which his grandfather often endorses and aids. Despite his wild nature and attempts to appear tough, Riley occasionally shows a softer, innocent side. While his brother practices martial arts, Riley is skilled in street fighting, as shown in \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Smokin' with Cigarettes\\". * Robert Jebediah \\"Grandad\\" Freeman (voiced by John Witherspoon) – is the grandfather and legal guardian of Huey and Riley. While he loves his two grandsons, he sometimes explodes in tirades of angry frustration over their wisecracking observations, constant schemes, and misadventures, although he has his own moments; for instance, his eagerly misguided dating pursuits unwittingly attract bizarre or dangerous women. According to Season 3's \\"It's a Black President, Huey Freeman\\", \\"Nobody knows exactly how old Robert Freeman is--not even himself.\\" Robert often threatens to discipline his grandsons, mainly Riley with Three Stooges-style corporal punishment and has developed a remarkable degree of speed and dexterity in wielding his belt for this purpose. He was an avid civil rights activist during his salad days.  Episodes  Both the comic strip and the cartoon were influenced by McGruder's love of anime and manga. He cites Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo as sources of inspiration for the series' fight scenes. The opening sequence of Season 1 contains similarities to that of Samurai Champloo. Some of the humor is based on the characters' anime-style movements. In 2006, McGruder explained in an interview, \\"We now have a Japanese anime studio named Madhouse to help us out\\", but at some point, the deal with Madhouse fell through. Instead, MOI Animation, an Emmy Award-winning South Korean studio, handled the animation for season two onwards. As a result, the following seasons of the series have more detailed animation, as well as minor updates for most of the character designs. The episode \\"Pause\\" presents a thinly veiled parody of Tyler Perry, presented as using his religion to hide his cross-dressing. The episode reportedly angered Perry, with the network responding to his complaints by saying that they should have warned him before the episode aired. While the series was originally going to end with the third season, on March 21, 2014, it was revealed via press release from Adult Swim that The Boondocks would return for a fourth and final season.Peep “The Boondocks” Season 3 Trailer It was later revealed that the fourth season would be produced without the involvement of the series creator Aaron McGruder. The reason cited for the split between the creator and the company was a disagreement over the production schedule.  Social critique  Political criticism = The Boondocks gives commentary on American politics from a black perspective. The series accomplishes this by using satire and controversial statements, such as one of the opening lines in the series, \\"Jesus was Black, Ronald Reagan was the devil, and the government is lying about 9/11.\\" The show has also given input on subjects like the American government's response to Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq War, and other controversial political events that took place throughout the 2000s. When asked about the show and the approaches taken that make it so controversial, series creator Aaron McGruder said, \\"I just hope to expand the dialogue and hope the show will challenge people to think about things they wouldn't normally think about, or think about it in a very different way.\\" = Black cultural relevance and critique = The series typically features appearances by well-known entities (singers, rappers, public figures) within Black popular culture as well as parodies of them. Episodes often feature cameos, as in the episode \\"Let's Nab Oprah,\\" which features appearances from Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou, and Bill Cosby. Other appearances and parodies within the show include R. Kelly on trial for sexual misconduct accusations, DMX's disbelief when told about Barack Obama running for president in an interview, and an episode that mimicked Juice. The series also parodies famous news reports including a broadcast in which a freshman in high school was called a \\"nigga\\" by his teacher, who thought the word was acceptable to use. The Boondocks recreates this incident with Riley and his teacher. The series often challenges the ways African Americans behave and think. It has used sardonic humor to teach lessons and get people thinking since it was a comic strip, critiquing the behavior of famous African Americans throughout the early 2000s. McGruder was interviewed by Nightline in early 2006 on the episode \\"Return of the King\\", which sparked much controversy after Martin Luther King Jr. reprimanded a crowd of African Americans for being lazy and unaware of their political climate. In the interview, McGruder said, \\"In the episode, King is critical of our apathy and inactivity... We carry the blame of our own apathy and inactivity... We deserve to take a look at that and be honest about it.\\"  Use of the word \\"nigga\\" The Boondocks is known for its frequent usage of the word nigga, which has been a source of controversy for the show throughout its tenure. McGruder once said about the word, \\"I think it makes the show sincere... the word Nigga is used so commonly now, not only by myself but people I know, that I feel it's fake to write around it and not use it.\\" He also said in a 2005 ABC News article, \\"This isn't the nigga show... I just wish we would expand the dialogue and evolve past the same conversation that we've had over the past 30 years about race in our country.\\"  Reception  The Boondocks received positive reviews for its first three seasons while the fourth season received negative reviews. In January 2006, it was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 37th NAACP Image Awards alongside The Bernie Mac Show, Everybody Hates Chris, Girlfriends, and Half & Half. The show won a Peabody Award in 2006 for the episode \\"Return of the King.\\"66th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2007. The first season garnered positive reviews, having a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 21 reviews. IGN named it the 94th-best animated series, describing it as a sharp satirical look at American society. Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson of the San Francisco Examiner said, \\"Each episode is beautifully crafted, with an eye on lush, shadowy visuals and a pulsing, jazz-like rhythm... the show is almost consistently funny, consistently brilliant, and, best of all, compulsively watchable.\\" Mike Hale of the New York Times has considered The Boondocks among the top television shows of 2010, citing \\"Pause\\" as a \\"painfully funny\\" satire of Tyler Perry being portrayed as a superstar actor and a leader of a homoerotic cult. In 2013, IGN placed The Boondocks as number 17 on their list of Top 25 animated series for adults. = Criticism and controversy = The Boondocks has been a frequent subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, \\"Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, the war on terrorism and the September 11 attacks.\\" Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word \\"nigger\\". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, the Reverend Al Sharpton protested the first-season episode \\"Return of the King,\\" for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word \\"nigga,\\" saying \\"Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures.\\" Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder: \\"We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action,\\" the statement said. The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being \\"an especially daring episode\\". During The Boondocks Season 2, two episodes were removed from broadcast without any official word from the network. Originally slated to air on November 16 and December 17, \\"The Hunger Strike\\" and \\"The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\\" were both heavily critical of BET. An exclusive clip of \\"The Hunger Strike\\" was given to HipHopDX.com in late January 2008, before both episodes were included in full on the Season 2 DVD release that summer. An anonymous source close to the show told HipHopDX.com that they heard BET had been pressuring Sony (the studio behind The Boondocks) to ban the episodes and threatened legal action. Cartoon Network publicly stated that \\"...neither Turner nor Adult Swim were contacted by BET, Ms. Lee or Mr. Hudlin\\". However, BET's parent company, Viacom, did threaten legal action against Sony if said episodes were broadcast to air in the United States.http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=124786 Tyler Perry was reportedly infuriated by his depiction in the Season 3 episode \\"Pause\\", first aired in June 2010, although he has officially given no response. The episode stars Winston Jerome, a parody of Perry, a \\"closeted, cross-dressing cult leader whose love of the Christian faith is a mask for his true sexuality,\\" in what the Los Angeles Times described as \\"one of the sharpest public criticisms of Perry\\". Soon after the episode aired, Perry got in touch with executives at Turner Broadcasting and \\"complained loudly\\" about the episode, threatening to rethink his relationship with the company.

That same year, his elaborate four-part arrangement was published by Oxford University Press, under the title \\"A Merry Christmas: West Country traditional song\\". Warrell's arrangement is notable for using \\"I\\" instead of \\"we\\" in the words; the first line is \\"I wish you a Merry Christmas\\".

The son of Georges Jacob, an outstanding chairmaker who worked in the Louis XVI style and Directoire styles of the earlier phase of Neoclassicism and executed many royal commissions, Jacob-Desmalter, in partnership with his older brother, assumed the family workshop in 1796. Freed from the Parisian guild restrictions of the Ancien Régime, the workshop was now able to produce veneered case-pieces (ébénisterie) in addition to turned and carved seat furniture (menuiserie). When his brother died, Jacob-Desmalter drew his father from retirement and began to develop one of the largest furniture workshops in Napoleonic Paris. Furniture in the Empire style produced by the firm of Jacob-Desmalter et Cie (\\"and Company\\") in rue Meslée, Paris, mainly employed mahogany veneers with gilt-bronze mounts. Seat furniture forms, of mahogany when they were not painted or gilded, derived inspiration from seats and thrones of Antiquity, recognizable in details from bas-reliefs and on Greek vases. Jacob-Desmalter, principal supplier of furniture to the Emperor, also received commissions from Pauline Borghese, Napoleon's sister in Rome, and the Empresses Joséphine and Marie Louise, for whom he supplied numerous pieces for the Château de Malmaison, the Château de Compiègne, the Tuileries Palace, and other imperial residences. Important commissions included a magnificent cradle built for the infant King of Rome, and the most expensive single item, the jewel cabinet for the Empress, delivered in 1809 for the Empress Joséphine's state bedroom in the Tuileries (soon to be used by Marie-Louise). It was designed by the architect Charles Percier and embellished with gilt-bronze plaques: the central one, according to its original description, depicts the \\"Birth of the Queen of the Earth, to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten with their Offerings\\" by the Empire's most eminent bronzier, Pierre-Philippe Thomire, modelled by Antoine-Denis Chaudet.Jewel cabinet, now at the Louvre. Greatly dependent on orders from Napoleon, the firm went bankrupt in 1813, when Imperial debts mounted during the last phase of the Napoleonic Empire. Jacob-Desmalter, however, managed to resurrect the company, and commissions revived after 1815. He continued to run it until his son, Georges-Alphonse, succeeded him in 1825.

Billig was popular among her patients and her exceptional medical work during the Second World War earned her honours and awards, as well as the nickname \\"The Angel of Cable Street\\". After the war, she resumed her medical practice on Cable Street before retiring to Israel, continuing her medical work there until her death. Childhood Billig was born at 41 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields, in the East End of London, and grew up around Brick Lane where Jewish friends had taken them in. Her parents, Barnett and Milly Billig, were refugees from Russia, escaping from anti-Jewish pogroms. The Billig family had six children, four of which became doctors. Her sister was a nurse and a brother Levi was an oriental studies scholar who was shot dead in Jerusalem in 1936. Parents Barnett and Milly encouraged their children to spend their time reading instead of playing in the streets. Her mother stayed home with the children, managing the household, while Barnett worked as a newsagent rolling cigarettes and eventually as a cigar roller. At the age of 11, Billig received a scholarship to attend Myrdle Street Central School in Stepney. She remained at the top of her class which eventually earned her a scholarship to London University. Early medical career 198, Cable Street, Billig's surgery and home Billig won a scholarship to the University of London to read medicine. She trained at the Royal Free Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, and qualified as a doctor in 1925. She worked for two years at the Jewish Maternity Hospital in Underwood Street. In 1927, she set up a small clinic near Cable Street, moving her surgery in 1935 round the corner to a Georgian townhouse at 198, Cable Street, where a blue plaque commemorates her work. Billig was also on call as a police surgeon which meant she often had to leave in the middle of whatever she was doing, even surgery. She used to cycle to her patients, with her black bag; later she drove a Morris Cowley car. Billig was fond of children, encouraging them to bring books for her to read to them and letting some carry her doctor bag - which was considered a great honour by the children. Her daily schedule was based around surgeries in the morning and evening, home visits in the afternoon and the occasional night visit for patients giving birth or falling ill in the middle of the night. The area she was based in was poor and people had trouble affording the consultation and medicine fees. There was not a national health service so it was common for people to delay calling on a doctor until their symptoms were extremely serious. Second World War and awards During the Blitz, Billig was the doctor in charge of the air raid shelters in Wapping. During bombing raids, she tended the sick and injured in the underground shelters. On 13 March 1941, Billig was attending to residents of Orient Wharf in Wapping following a bomb blast. An explosion threw her out of the shelter and broke her ankle. After bandaging it herself, she helped to get the others out of the rubble, and cared for them through the night. For her bravery, Billig was awarded the George Medal. The citation read; \\"Hannah Billig, M.B., B.S., Medical Practitioner, Stepney. During an air raid Dr. Billig, although herself injured, left shelter to attend to casualties in the street. Bombs dropped within twenty yards of her but for four hours she continued to give treatment to the injured. She showed great bravery and attention to duty, regardless of her personal safety and injuries.\\" In January 1943 she was commissioned in the Indian Medical Service and posted to Calcutta. Captain Billig was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1945 New Year Honours for her work in Calcutta in the aftermath of the Bengal famine. Later years and death Billig returned to Cable Street and worked within the new National Health Service until her retirement in 1964. In 1962, she was elected as president of the London Jewish Hospital Medical Society. She moved to Caesarea on the coast of Israel and, after learning the language well enough, she worked in Arab villages and Jewish settlements. Billig continued to work into her 80s until her health began to interfere. She died there on 11 July 1987, aged 85. She never married.

The Conservatives won this election, and Graham sat as a member of the opposition. In early 1915, the Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin was forced from office amid a corruption scandal. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Graham was personally re-elected, defeating Lyons by 163 votes. For the next five years, he served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration. He was defeated in the 1920 election, losing to Conservative Reuben Waugh by 217 votes.

Palace Moravia (Palác Morava in Czech, Morava- Palast in German) is a building in City of Brno, Czech Republic. In 1926, an architectural competition for the model of a hotel was announced. This was supposed to be built on a place of former music-hall building. World-known architects, including Peter Behrens and Jacobus Oud participated in this contest, alongside home-born architects. Eventually, this place was built over by Arnošt Wiesner by a slightly different complex of buildings. He had to face up not only ground plan difficult parcel but also geologically poor sub-soil. During the design, he also cooperated with structural engineer Jaroslav Valenta. In the bottom part of the building, there was a commercial zone, a basement cinema, and a bar. A coffee lounge was situated in the first floor with a large terrace attached to it. Thanks to the genial natural lightning in the top area of the building, Wiesner dedicated this part to residential apartments. A contrast of reinforced concrete and raw brickwork is also very interesting. Later on, Wiesner linked the building of Moravská zemská životní pojišťovna (Moravian Life Insurance Company) to the whole construction.

All versions of the attraction are similar. The attraction is a stage show with audio-animatronic figures. Most of the characters are redneck bears who perform country music. Characters rise up to the stage on platforms, descend from the ceiling, and appear from behind curtains. The audience includes audio-animatronic animal heads mounted on the walls who interact with characters on stage. Due to overwhelming popularity, The Country Bear Jamboree was given a \\"spin-off\\" show which appeared during the 1984 winter season at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It was called The Country Bear Christmas Special. In 1986 it was given a summertime version called The Country Bear Vacation Hoedown. This version was so popular at Disneyland that it became the permanent edition until the attraction's closing in 2001. In 2002, a movie titled The Country Bears was released which was based on the attraction and its characters. History The Country Bear Jamboree was originally intended by Walt Disney to be placed at Disney's Mineral King Ski Resort in California which he was trying to build in the mid 1960s. Disney knew he wanted some sort of show to provide entertainment to the guests at the resort, and he knew he wanted the show to feature some sort of bear band. The project was assigned to imagineer Marc Davis. Davis, together with Al Bertino, came up with many bear groups, including bear marching bands, bear mariachi bands, and Dixieland bears. One day Davis was working on drawings of the characters in his office. Disney walked in and saw the drawings and laughed because he loved the characters. On Disney's way out he turned to Davis and said good-bye, which he was known never to say. That was the last time Davis saw Disney, who died a few days later on December 15, 1966. After his death, plans for the show still carried on. The bears would be featured in the resort's Bear Band Restaurant Show, and it was decided that they would have a country twang. But while plans for the show progressed, plans for the ski resort did not. Instead, the Imagineers working on the project decided to place the show in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in time for its grand opening in 1971. Imagineer X Atencio and musical director George Bruns created songs for the bears to sing. On October 1, 1971, The Country Bear Jamboree opened its doors in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. It received so much positive feedback that Imagineers immediately planned to make a replica of the show to be placed in Disneyland. The addition to the show in Disneyland inspired a brand new land appropriately titled Bear Country. Because of the tremendous popularity of the show in Walt Disney World, excess capacity was added to the Disneyland incarnation in the form of two identical theaters, each housing a copy of the show in its entirety. The Disneyland version of the attraction opened on March 4, 1972. Due to the huge popularity of the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions a third version of the attraction was planned to open at Tokyo Disneyland on April 15, 1983. The Tokyo Version also houses two identical theaters, like the Disneyland version, and uses better more modern audio animatronics which look more realistic than the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland versions. During the 1984 holiday season was the debut of the Country Bear Christmas Special at the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland Resort. In 1986, the Vacation Hoedown debuted at both Disneyland (February) and the Magic Kingdom (May). During the holiday season, the bears still performed their Christmas Show in Florida through 2005. Attendance struggled during the Vacation Hoedown's run in Florida, so for Magic Kingdom's 20th anniversary in 1992, the original show returned to rotate with the Christmas show as it had since 1984. The attraction closed at Disneyland on September 9, 2001, to make room for The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh which opened on April 11, 2003. The Country Bear Christmas Special was the first time an attraction at any Disney theme park became interchangeable during the year. The Country Bear Vacation Hoedown was added a little over 1 1/2 years later. Both the Country Bear Christmas Special and The Country Bear Vacation Hoedown were created, directed, and animated by Dave Feiten and Mike Sprout. The Tokyo Disneyland version of the attraction still features all three versions of the show at different times of the year. On August 21, 2012, the Walt Disney World version of the Country Bear Jamboree closed for a nearly two-month-long refurbishment. All the characters in the show received new skin, fur, and costumes. The songs \\"Pretty Little Devilish Mary\\" and \\"Fractured Folk Song\\" and some of the dialogue were removed, while other songs were shortened. The show is now 4 to 5 minutes shorter than it was before. The shorter version of the show opened on October 17, 2012. CharactersBears= The queue for the Disneyland version included fake doors in appropriate shapes for each of the bear performers. Henry – The Master of Ceremonies of the show, Henry is a welcoming and friendly brown bear. He wears a grey top hat, starched shirt front, and a string tie.

The Five Bear Rugs * Zeke – Considered the leader of The Five Bear Rugs, Zeke plays a banjo and taps on the dishpan with \\"a real ol' country beat\\". He is a grey bear with glasses who wears a tan top hat. He was voiced by Dallas McKennon from October 1971 until July 1975, when Randy Sparks rerecorded his vocals.

Zeke's solo song \\"Pretty Little Devilish Mary\\" was removed from the Florida version of the show in October 2012. * Zeb – Zeb is brown bear with a light brown stomach. He plays the fiddle as well as wears a bandanna around his neck and a derby hat. He is voiced by a member of the Stoneman family. * Ted – Ted is a tall, skinny bear who blows on the cornjug and plays the washboard. His fur is brown, and he wears a vest with a brown hat. * Fred – The biggest of the five bears, Fred ironically plays the smallest instrument: the mouthharp. He is a brown bear and wears blue jeans held up with suspenders as well as a striped red and white tie. * Tennessee – Tennessee Bear plays \\"The Thing\\" (an upright bass with only one string and a tiny bird sitting on it). He is blonde bear (brown in Tokyo Disneyland) and wears a bandanna around his neck. He is voiced by a member of the Stoneman family. Baby Oscar – Oscar appears with The Five Bear Rugs, but plays no instrument. In fact, he never says a word. He is a brown bear and always has his teddy bear to keep him company. In the 1971 album, it is mentioned that Zeb is his father. =Other Animals= Melvin, Buff, and Max (left to right) at the Walt Disney World Country Bear Jamboree Buff – Buff is considered the leader of the mounted animal heads and is also the largest. He is the head portion of an American bison. He is voiced by Disney legend Thurl Ravenscroft. Max – Max is the head portion of a whitetail buck and is voiced by Peter Renaday. Melvin – Melvin, a bull moose head, is of the animal head trio. He often makes good-natured jokes and is voiced by Bill Lee. Sammy – Sammy is Henry's raccoon pal who cuddles around Henry's top hat. He acts like a coonskin cap for Henry. He is voiced by Bill Cole. In the Country Bear Vacation Hoedown, Sammy gets replaced by a skunk named Randy. At Disneyland, Max, Buff, and Melvin currently reside in The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, which replaced the Country Bear Playhouse in 2003 (which had closed two years prior). They hang above the entrance to the \\"Hunny Heaven\\" room, but riders must turn around in order to see them. The set of Max, Buff & Melvin featured there were the Audio-Animatronic figures found in one of the shows.https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/07/five-things-you-might- have-missed-in-critter-country-at-disneyland-park/ At the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland the three trophy heads of Max, Buff and Melvin hung on the right side of the theatre but at Disneyland they hung on the left side. The Tokyo Disneyland and the Former Disneyland versions of the show houses 2 theatres. The Magic Kingdom version only houses 1 theatre. The Show The show is basically a continuous string of short country songs sung by the various bears. As each bear sings their song, a curtain opens to reveal them, except in the case of Wendell, Gomer, and the Sun Bonnet Trio (all of whom rise from the center stage), and Teddi Barra (who descends from the ceiling). The show begins with Max, Buff, and Melvin telling Henry to get on with the show. Henry then asks Gomer to give him a \\"little intro\\", and the jamboree begins. =The Songs= Walt Disney World version: * \\"Pianjo\\" – Gomer and Henry * \\"Bear Band Serenade\\" – The Five Bear Rugs, Gomer, and Henry * \\"If You Can't Bite, Don't Growl\\" – Ernest and the Five Bear Rugs * \\"My Woman Ain't Pretty (But She Don't Swear None)\\" – Liver Lips McGrowl * \\"Mama, Don't Whip Little Buford\\" – Henry and Wendell * \\"Tears Will Be the Chaser For Your Wine\\" – Trixie * \\"How Long Will My Baby Be Gone\\" – Terrence * \\"All the Guys That Turn Me On Turn Me Down\\" – The Sun Bonnet Trio * \\"Heart, We Did All That We Could\\" – Teddi Barra * \\"Blood on the Saddle\\" – Big Al * \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\\" – Henry and Sammy * \\"Ole Slew Foot\\" – Cast (minus Ernest and Trixie, who do not appear onstage, and Big Al, who reprises \\"Blood on the Saddle\\") * \\"Come Again\\" – Henry, Sammy, Max, Buff, and Melvin Tokyo Disneyland version: * \\"Pianjo\\" – Gomer and Henry * \\"Bear Band Serenade\\" – The Five Bear Rugs, Gomer, and Henry (sung in Japanese) * \\"Fractured Folk Song\\" (Kenneth C.

Cheese restaurants were inspired by the Disneyland show to make their own animatronic musical show. * The Simpsons has repeatedly referenced the show, with Homer commenting \\"It's like a freakin' Country Bear Jambaroo around here!\\" * One of Terry Gilliam's animations from the British television series Monty Python's Flying Circus included Big Al (and Mickey Mouse) as one of a menagerie of animals getting shot in a safari and thrown into a cocktail shaker (Season 3, Episode 10: \\"E. Henry Thripshaws Disease\\"). * The television show The Critic has frequently parodied the bears and their show, including a reference where a Big Al lookalike stands in for an audioanimatronic Bill Clinton. From the same show, the character Duke Phillips has his own personal Country Bear Jamboree that sings in praise of him, which he accidentally activates when denouncing the belief that all southerners are country bumpkins. * Fry mentions the show in the Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs, criticizing Leela for not liking it. In the show's episode, \\"The Series Has Landed,\\" the Goofy Gopher Revue is also reminiscent of the attraction. * A Goofy Movie contains an in-house parody of the show known as \\"Lester's Possum Park.\\" * In The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon wisecracks in response to Penny's awe over Wolowitz's mechanical robot arm, \\"At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree\\" http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-4-episode-01-the-robotic- manipulation/ (Season 4 Episode 01 – The Robotic Manipulation). * The 2002 Disney film The Country Bears is loosely based on the attraction and used the same characters. * Tim Allen as Mike Baxter in TV show, Last Man Standing, referenced the Bears saying, \\"he'll be up there with Bear-Jesus and most of the Country Bear Jamboree.\\" * The Hard Luck Bears has a similar version (but with different characters) seen in the UK and has different songs than the Disney version. The instruments for the jamboree was changed to match CEC's different bands. Technical facts There are five stages, numbered, from left to right, 1 & 2 (left wing), 3 (main stage), 4 and 5 (right wing). A cast of 18 audio-animatronic bears appear on the various stages and also rise up through the floor and drop from the ceiling. Stages 1, 2, 4 and 5 are actually turntables with two animatronics each fixed to them. As each scene finishes, the turntable revolves behind curtains and another character will be present on stage when the curtains open again, giving the impression that the performers have \\"moved\\" between stages. Approximately one third of each turntable is always visible to the guests, while the remaining two thirds emerge into a backstage area where maintenance can be carried out on the animatronics; even minor maintenance during shows if necessary, as there is approximately a 50-120 second turn around between scenes. The host bear, Henry, actually appears in the form of three separate figures during the show. The main stage has several backgrounds which descend on rails to provide a backdrop to the animatronics performing on the main stage. These backgrounds change when the main stage curtains are closed. The Five Bear Rugs are visible when there is no backdrop and it is their turn to perform. They are on a rolling platform that rolls forward during their part of the show. The rolling platform remains in Tokyo's version and changes seasonally from the Bandstand used in the Original show to the log used in the Vacation & Christmas show (the latter covering the top of the log in cotton to represent snow). Additional figures rise up from the stage floor and from the ceiling on hydraulic platforms when necessary.

It is located on the coast, between the seaside resorts of Redcar and Saltburn-by-the-Sea, although it is not itself a seaside resort. Marske is in the civil parish of Saltburn, Marske and New Marske and comprises the wards of Longbeck (shared with New Marske) and St Germains.  History  Marske is mentioned in the Domesday Book. St Germain's Church was consecrated by bishop Ægelric between 1042 and 1056. Marske was amerced 20 marks for its part in the pillaging of a Norwegian vessel in 1180. = RFC Marske = RFC/RAF base in Marske The Royal Flying Corps had a landing strip and schools in Marske. 'Captain' W. E. Johns, the author of the Biggles books, was posted to RFC Marske during part of the First World War, from April until August 1918. The Bristol M1C Monoplane, The Red Devil, was first flown from this RFC aerodrome. The RAF later administered an airfield here. After the Second World War the site of the aerodrome became an ICI depot and later a housing estate, The Landings, with roads named on an aeronautical theme: Avro Close, Blackburn Grove, De Havilland Drive – leading onto Vickers Lane–, Beardmore Avenue, Folland Drive, Wellington Close, Brabazon Drive, Halifax Close and Lysander Court.  Politics  Marske is part of Redcar constituency and is represented by Conservative Jacob Young in the House of Commons.  Economy  The Harbour at Marske The majority of the residents of Marske do not work within the village, but work in nearby industry or in Middlesbrough or Redcar. Marske has a range of local shops and a mixture of light industries on the Industrial Estate notably label and barcode specialists Weyfringe. There is also small scale sea fishing using cobles and tractors from the beach.  Landmarks  Marske has two imposing mansion houses. * Marske Hall* was built around 1625 and was formerly the home of the Zetland family. It was gifted to Leonard Cheshire to be run as a home for the disabled in 1964 and continued as such for the following 55 years, until it was sold as a going concern to a private company in 2019. * Cliff House,* which stands on the cliff tops overlooking the beach, was built in the 19th century as a holiday residence for the Pease family, who were prominent in the north-east business community, at the time, and principal shareholders in the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The railway was extended to Redcar in the 1840s and to Marske and Saltburn in the 1860s. Marske has its own post office, medical centre, leisure centre and a library. The village has Methodist, Baptist, Church of England and Roman Catholic churches and five public houses: The Frigate, The Ship Inn,* The Zetland, The Mermaid and The Clarendon. The tower of St Germain's church was allowed to remain close to the cliff edge as a prominent landmark. The tower is used by inshore fishermen to find the harbour since otherwise the coastal cliffs would appear relatively featureless. Most of Marske's listed buildings are to be found on High Street,High Street: , , , , , , , , , , , and Redcar Road,Redcar Road: , , , , , , , , , , but there are a few more on Church Street,Church Street: Cliff Terrace,Cliff Terrace: East Street,East Street: and The Garth.The Garth: = Winkies Castle = Winkies Castle Marske is also home to a museum named Winkies Castle, dating back to the 17th century, which is run by volunteers and open to visitors from Easter Saturday each year until the end of September. This is not really a castle but an old half cruck cottage formerly owned by the late master shoemaker, Jack Anderson. There is a story that the house's name comes from Jack's cat named Winkie. The museum has rotating exhibitions and over 6,000 articles; including a two-headed lamb called \\"Bill and Ben\\". The building was saved from demolition in 1968 by Jack Anderson when he turned it into a community museum and bequeathed it to the Community of Marske (trustees Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council). It is now run and managed by volunteers; it is open three days a week from Easter Saturday until the end of September each year.  Transport  Marske is served by Longbeck and Marske railway stations, which connect to Darlington railway station. The main road through Marske is the A1085 Coast Road and High Street. Marske is served by the Arriva North East 4/4A, 64/64A, 81/81A/781, and X3/X4 bus services.  Education  Marske-by-the-Sea has three primary schools: Errington Primary School, Westgarth Primary School, and St Bede's R.C. Primary School. Marske is served by the following secondary schools: Outwood Academy Bydales located within the village and Rye Hills School, Sacred Heart Secondary Catholic Voluntary Academy located in Redcar, and Huntcliff School located in Saltburn.  Sport  Marske-by-the-Sea has an Martial Art ITF Tae Kwon Do School. Furthermore, the village has two Football teams; Northern League Division 1 football club Champions, Marske United F.C. and Langbaurgh League Division 2 Champions, Marske F.C as well as a cricket club, and badminton club.  Notable people  England and Yorkshire cricketer Paul Jarvis grew up in Marske. His Yorkshire cc jumper can be found on display in Marske cricket club. Charles Dickens visited Marske in around 1844 to see the grave of Captain Cook's father. An early 20th century memorial, 20–30 yards west of St Germain's tower, marks the approximate location. 'Captain' W.E. Johns, the author of the Biggles books, was based at RFC Marske towards the end of the First World War. Marske was home to Charlotte Hughes, the longest- lived person ever documented in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s West Indies cricketer Albert Padmore lived in Marske. Steve Oliver, the writer, director, and radio broadcaster attended Errington Primary School, until his family relocated to Norfolk in 1985. Marske was also home of artist Chris Dooks—past director of arts television programmes, such as The South Bank Show. Middlesbrough Football Club players, Robbie Stockdale & Cameron Park both grew up in Marske. Singer and songwriter Georgina Anderson, who died from cancer in 2013 at the age of 15, also came from Marske and attended Bydales Secondary School. The electronic music group Radio Massacre International was formed in Marske in the early 1980s. Actor-playwright, singer-songwriter Shaun Lawton, born 1941 in New Marske, lived in Marske from 1950 to 1957.

Six-component Brunnian link. In knot theory, a branch of topology, a Brunnian link is a nontrivial link that becomes a set of trivial unlinked circles if any one component is removed. In other words, cutting any loop frees all the other loops (so that no two loops can be directly linked). The name Brunnian is after Hermann Brunn. Brunn's 1892 article Über Verkettung included examples of such links.  Examples  The Borromean rings are the simplest Brunnian link. The best-known and simplest possible Brunnian link is the Borromean rings, a link of three unknots. However for every number three or above, there are an infinite number of links with the Brunnian property containing that number of loops. Here are some relatively simple three-component Brunnian links which are not the same as the Borromean rings: Image:Brunnian-3-not-Borromean.svg12-crossing link. Image:Three-triang-18crossings-Brunnian.svg18-crossing link. Image:Three- interlaced-squares-Brunnian-24crossings.svg24-crossing link. The simplest Brunnian link other than the 6-crossing Borromean rings is presumably the 10-crossing L10a140 link.Bar-Natan, Dror (2010-08-16). \\"All Brunnians, Maybe\\", [Academic Pensieve]. An example of a n-component Brunnian link is given by the \\"Rubberband\\" Brunnian Links, where each component is looped around the next as aba−1b−1, with the last looping around the first, forming a circle.  Classification  Brunnian links were classified up to link-homotopy by John Milnor in , and the invariants he introduced are now called Milnor invariants. An (n + 1)-component Brunnian link can be thought of as an element of the link group – which in this case (but not in general) is the fundamental group of the link complement – of the n-component unlink, since by Brunnianness removing the last link unlinks the others. The link group of the n-component unlink is the free group on n generators, Fn, as the link group of a single link is the knot group of the unknot, which is the integers, and the link group of an unlinked union is the free product of the link groups of the components. Not every element of the link group gives a Brunnian link, as removing any other component must also unlink the remaining n elements. Milnor showed that the group elements that do correspond to Brunnian links are related to the graded Lie algebra of the lower central series of the free group, which can be interpreted as \\"relations\\" in the free Lie algebra. = Massey products = Brunnian links can be understood in algebraic topology via Massey products: a Massey product is an n-fold product which is only defined if all (n − 1)-fold products of its terms vanish. This corresponds to the Brunnian property of all (n − 1)-component sublinks being unlinked, but the overall n-component link being non-trivially linked. Brunnian braids The standard braid is Brunnian: if one removes the black strand, the blue strand is always on top of the red strand, and they are thus not braided around each other; likewise for removing other strands. A Brunnian braid is a braid that becomes trivial upon removal of any one of its strings. Brunnian braids form a subgroup of the braid group. Brunnian braids over the 2-sphere that are not Brunnian over the 2-disk give rise to non-trivial elements in the homotopy groups of the 2-sphere. For example, the \\"standard\\" braid corresponding to the Borromean rings gives rise to the Hopf fibration S3 → S2, and iterations of this (as in everyday braiding) is likewise Brunnian. Real-world examples Many disentanglement puzzles and some mechanical puzzles are variants of Brunnian Links, with the goal being to free a single piece only partially linked to the rest, thus dismantling the structure. Brunnian chains are also used to create wearable and decorative items out of elastic bands using devices such as the Rainbow Loom or Wonder Loom.

In life he was an Ethiopian monk and abbot of Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq of Amba Sel. He was born in Dehana, which may have been the woreda in the Wag Hemra Zone, although G.W.B. Huntingford identifies it with Dahna, a village 15 miles east of the Tekezé River.G.W.B. Huntingford, The Historical Geography of Ethiopia (London: The British Academy, 1989), p. 74 At the age of 30, Iyasus Mo'a travelled to the monastery of Debre Damo during the abbacy of Abba Yohannis where he was made a monk, and was given arduous tasks by the abbot. After seven years, he left Debra Damo and came to live with a hermetic community living around the 8th-century church of Istanafanos at Lake Hayq, and organized this group into a monastery with rules and a school. One of the students of this school was Saint Tekle Haymanot, who stayed at the monastery for 10 years.Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), pp. 158-160. One of the Zagwe kings later made him abbot of this monastery. His biography, the Gadla Iyasus Mo\`a (\\"Acts of Iyasus Mo\`a\\"), records that Yekuno Amlak had fled from the authorities in Amba Sel and hid in the church because of a prophecy (tinbit) that he would become a king. His mother, upon hearing such prediction, brought him to Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq and begged the priests there to hide her son and save him from being killed. Iyasus Mo'a protected and educated the boy, and in return, Emperor Yekuno Amlak built the structure to house his community. Later hagiographies state that Yekuno Amlak was helped by Tekle Haymanot, but the critical researches of Carlo Conti Rossini suggest that the Gadla Iyasus Mo\`a is closer to the correct version of events.Taddesse Tamrat, p.67.

Biography Riccardo Illy was born in Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia. His paternal grandfather, Francesco Illy, was of Hungarian origin. As a young man Illy worked as a skiing instructor at Piancavallo and a sailing instructor at Monfalcone. He married Rossana Bettini, food and wine journalist, at a young age. They have a daughter Daria who is now a Physical Education teacher and personal trainer. Illy started work in the family's coffee making firm illycaffè in 1977, which was founded by his grandfather in 1933. As the company's Business Director, reorganised its internal business structure as well as the structures of the other firms it controlled. He created a marketing department for the company which, up to then, did not have one. He subsequently served as CEO and is presently the Vice President of the company, which has a presence in over 140 countries. Illy is the author of a book entitled Dal Caffe all'Espresso (From Coffeebeans to Espresso) published by Mondadori and translated into English, French and German. Illy has held positions of Vice President of the Association of Industrialists in Trieste and President of the Seminario Permanente Veronelli. Standing as an independent supported by a coalition which preceded Ulivo (the Olive Branch Party) and also by a civic list bearing his name, Illy has been elected twice — in 1993 and again in 1997 — as Mayor of Trieste. As First Citizen and a sincere music lover, he has taken up the position of President of Trieste's Theatre Giuseppe Verdi. Until 2002 he was Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the Transpadane European Railway Line. Illy was honoured with the title of Grande Ufficiale (Order of Merit of the Italian Republic) by the President of the Italian Republic, and the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold title by the President of the Austrian Republic. He was awarded an honoris causa degree in Political Sciences at the University of Trieste after his \\"lectio doctoralis\\" on the topic of enlargement of Europe to the Eastern Countries. In 2001, Illy was elected a Member of the Italian Parliament with the mixed group of independent members. He was part of the IX Parliamentary Commission (Transport, Postal Services and Telecommunications) and Secretary to the Advisory Parliamentary Commission regarding the bringing into force of the administrative reforms. He has strongly believed in and promoted the referendum not confirming the regional electoral law. When the direct election of the President was obtained, he kept his promise to the citizens of Trieste and he ran as a candidate for the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region supported by the Democratic Coalition Party (Intesa Democratica). He was elected President of the Region in the elections held on 8 and 9 June 2003. He was unanimously elected President of the Assembly of European Regions (AER) in December 2004, and his mandate ended in 2008. The AER currently has 250 member Regions from 30 European countries. On 14 April 2008 Illy was defeated in his re-election bid by candidate Renzo Tondo, and his term as President ended on 18 April 2008.

Life and career Aly was born in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg. He is a patrilineal descendant of a Turkish convert to Christianity named Friedrich Christian (Haydar) Aly who was a chamberlain at the Prussian court in the late 1600s. By family tradition, the oldest son gets the middle name 'Haydar'. He sees himself as an ethnic German except for the accident of his name. (See the German version of this article.) After attending the Deutsche Journalistenschule, Aly studied history and political science in Berlin. As a journalist, he worked for the taz, the Berliner Zeitung and the FAZ. Active in the leftist German student movement in the late 60s and early 70s, he has published a polemic retrospective book Unser Kampf 1968: Ein irritierter Blick zurück (Fischer TB, Frankfurt/Main 2009) in which he argues the radical students of the time had more in common with the \\"1933 generation\\" than they realize. He obtained his Habilitation in political science at the Free University of Berlin in 1994 with a dissertation on the Nazi euthanasia of disabled children. His interest in the subject was initially sparked when his infant daughter incurred severe permanent brain damage from a meningitis infection. From 2004 to 2005, he was a visiting professor for interdisciplinary Holocaust research at the Fritz Bauer Institut in Frankfurt am Main, and 2012–3 at the Institute for Contemporary History at the University of Vienna. He has also been a visiting researcher at Yad Vashem. Work Aly researches the history of the Holocaust and the participation of social elites in Nazi destruction policies. In 2005 he gained public attention in Germany for the popular success of his book Hitlers Volksstaat (Hitler's People's State). In it, Aly characterises Nazi Germany as a \\"convenience dictatorship\\" that until late in World War II retained broad public support, in particular by making possible an unprecedented social mobility for the lower classes, by introducing redistributive fiscal policies and by greatly extending the German welfare state. Aly also recounts how all this was paid for in large part by confiscation of Jewish property in Germany and later the plunder of the conquered countries, and especially their Jewish populations. He maintains that the reason for the massive support the Nazi regime enjoyed among the German population was not so much a consequence of their violent anti-Semitism as their enjoying the fruits of the loot acquired by the Nazis in the occupied territories. He also shows how the Wehrmacht was directly involved in this mass plunder of the conquered populations and how in many cases it was the initiator of policies which led to confiscation and eventual extermination. His other point is that the conservative, non-Nazi financial state bureaucracy and the leading banks were crucial in formulating this policy of mass plunder and murder. Also, in his book 'Final Solution': Nazi Population Policy and the Murder of the European Jews, Aly argues that those of lower rank influenced the leadership to the Final Solution. This approach is what is known as the bottom-up approach of the Holocaust. Aly's views have not remained without criticism from the mainstream of historical research. Adam Tooze, in particular, rejected Aly's argumentation in detailed analysis published in the German press. Aly's work was awarded the Heinrich- Mann-Preis in 2002 and the Marion-Samuel-Preis one year later. In a mixed review in The New York Times, historian Steven Zipperstein described Aly's book Europe Against the Jews as \\"densely documented\\" but lacking accuracy on events outside of Germany.

The complex fully opened in September 2005 with two concert halls and many other facilities. Performing arts venues The Ferguson Center for the Arts contains three distinct, separate concert halls: the Diamonstein Concert Hall, the Peebles Theater, and the Studio Theater. =Diamonstein Concert Hall= Diamonstein Concert Hall is the flagship auditorium in the complex. The hall is acoustically engineered so that anyone on stage can be heard from any seat without a microphone. The hall has 1,725 seats. =Peebles Theater= A 453-seat theater in the Ferguson Center for the Arts complex. =The Studio Theater= A 200-seat theater in the Ferguson Center for the Arts complex. =Other facilities= The building also contains rehearsal halls, a dance studio, full scenery, prop and costume shops, arts studios, Ferguson Hall Art Gallery, the Falk Gallery, music practice rooms, and many educational classrooms and other learning areas. The majority of these rooms opened in the Fall of 2005. History Formerly, the Ferguson High School was located at 1 University Place. The name \\"Ferguson\\" is well known in the Newport News area because Homer L. Ferguson was the President of the nearby Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. The high school was named after him. Additionally, Newport News is home to the corporate headquarters of Ferguson Enterprises, a leading plumbing-supply company. Ferguson Enterprises sponsored the construction of the center, and was granted naming rights as a result of their contribution. Construction The Ferguson Center was designed by Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The center was constructed in two phases. The first phase of construction was completed in the summer months of 2004. The first phase completed the 440 seat Music and Theater Hall and a 200-seat Studio Theater. The second phase of construction was completed a year later. This added a 1,700-seat Concert Hall that was acoustically designed for stage performance. Most likely, when \\"The Ferguson Center\\" is mentioned outside of Christopher Newport University, this is what is being referred to. The construction was led by two opening acts. Tony Bennett performed in the Music and Theater hall on September 1, 2004. During the show, Tony Bennett remarked: \\"They don't make theaters like this anymore!\\". Actor and singer Michael Crawford opened the Concert Hall on September 12, 2005. The New York Pops accompanied him that night. 400px Criticism As theater plans and construction progressed, there was criticism within the CNU community, that money being spent on the project could be better spent in different academic ways. The university originally planned that the Ferguson Center would be unavailable for use by the university's music and theater departments, and any other non-administrative function on campus. The idea was to simply have a concert hall on campus. This policy was removed, and the Christopher Newport University’s theater, music and art departments are now housed in the center academic section of the building, This is the section of the building between the Concert Hall, and the Music and Theatre Hall.

It has a population of nearly 2,000, and was historically a center of Islamic studies. It is also known for olive tree farming and olive oil production. The Tripolian Republic was announced in Msallata on 16 November 1918 which was the first republic in the Arab world. Along with the city of Tarhuna, it gave its name to the former Libyan district of Tarhuna wa Msalata. Etymology There has not been any research on the etymology of the name Msallata, but there is some speculation as to its origins. One theory is that the name comes from the plural of the Arabic word for obelisk masalla which is masallat, because the city is the home of 22 tall buildings called qasaba. Others speculate that the name comes from the Arabic word salt (scrubbing), which also has the more specific meaning of 'scrubbing olive from its tree', with the M at the beginning being a variant of the Himyarite definite article am-. Supporters of this argument mention that Msallata is famous for its olive production. However, none of these claims have been scientifically substantiated. History The history of the city dates back to the Roman Ages where it was mentioned as Misfe, a station between Leptis Magna and Tarhunah. At the end of the First World War, the agreement on establishing the Tripolitanian Republic was signed in the city on November 16, 1918. Refugees from Msallata founded Ahisamakh in 1950. People Most residents of Msallata are not originally from the city, but from other cities. People in Mssallata are conservative and observant of Islamic laws, as in most Libyan cities. In a recent official census, Msallata has population of 79,709. Administrative divisions Msallata is divided into the districts of Qasabath, Cendara, Wadnah, Banilathe, Zafran, Algaleel, Elwatah, Akasha, Al-Hadirat, Al-Shafeen, Zawiyat as-Samah, Banimeslem, Gereem, Ghrarat, Mrad, Al-Swadnyah and Al-Zarruq. The city was a part of Al-Mergheb Governorate, but after the uprising in Libya, it became an independent governorate. The telephone code of the city is 053. Economy The economy of the city depends mainly on cultivating olive, wheat, and barley. There are as many as 19 olive mills in the city. In addition, herding sheep and goats is an important economic activity. Furthermore, there is a manufacture of cement. Education and culture The city has a branch of Almergheb University of Arts, a medical technical school, a religious sciences college, and an engineering faculty. In addition, Msalata is home to many Islamic schools, such as Zawiyat Al-Jourani, Mejabra Mosque,Zawiyat Al-Dokaly. It is also a destination for many Libyan and Sub-Saharan students who seek to learn the Quran. During the 2011 civil war Reuters reported clashes in Msallata on 3 August, in which three people were killed.Reuters, 4 August 2011, here By 5 August, AFP was reporting that the town, whose residents had joined the rebellion in its early stages,See message of allegiance to NTC . had come under siege.

Kennedy Fried Chickens typically compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in the inner city neighborhoods of several states along the East Coast. There are also a number in the West Coast, primarily in California. A number of these restaurants, located in other states, are named New York Fried Chicken, essentially designed in the same manner and offering the same general menu as Kennedy and Crown Fried Chicken. It is not an actual franchise; every \\"Kennedy\\" named chicken restaurant is independently owned and operated by different individuals but consist of almost the same menu.  History  Kennedy Fried Chicken was founded on May 16, 1969, with its first restaurant on Nostrand Avenue in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. There is a dispute among the people involved in the business over who is the actual founder. Some claim that it is Abdul Karim while others say Taeb Zia was the early founder. Zia, an Afghan immigrant originally from Kabul, Afghanistan, is known by some as Zia Chicken or \\"Lau Chicken\\" and is regarded as the father of Kennedy Fried Chicken. He immigrated to the United States in 1977 and began working at a fast food restaurant by the name of Kansas Fried Chicken, which was owned by African-Americans at the time. Prior to that he was studying engineering in Baku, Azerbaijan. After spending about three years learning how to run a fast food business, he decided to open his own fried chicken restaurant as he could be as good as others and sell 15-20% cheaper. Kennedy Fried Chicken was named after assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy, \\"because Afghans are fond of the former president.\\" During the 1980s and 1990s many of the same restaurants have opened across New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland and several other states, including West Coast states such as California. There are estimated to be about 1,000. The restaurants Inside a Crown Fried Chicken at 3706 North Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For the most part the restaurants share the same concept, if not the same menus. In addition to fried chicken they may offer fried fish, hot wings, short ribs, shrimp, burgers, pizza, beef patties on coco bread, sandwiches, fries, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, onion rings, sweet potato pies and a variety of flavors of ice cream for dessert.Restaurant Review: A Fast Food King With Many Choices, Southeast Queens Press, undated Some restaurants are in dangerous areas of the most dangerous cities, serving from behind bulletproof glass, especially at night. Those in safer suburbs have added to their menus Middle Eastern dishes such as kebabs with rice, but Kennedy's and Crown's specialties are the deep-fried chicken (described as \\"not too dry or too soggy\\"). Chicken and food are quite often ordered a la carte. Not all dishes are available for takeout and delivery. Menus are usually posted on the walls with photographs. Due to the tendency of these restaurants to appear in inner-city locations, Kennedy, Crown, and New York Fried Chicken are sometimes referred to as \\"ghetto chicken\\".Smith, Andrew. Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love To Eat, pg. 387, , 2011, Greenwood Publishing, Santa Barbara, California. In 2008 one Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant in Harlem, New York changed its name to \\"Obama Fried Chicken\\" in honor of the election of President Barack Obama.see: Obama Fried Chicken or Obama Fried Chicken & Pizza at Flickr.com for details. Legal matters The restaurants are traditionally owned and operated mostly by Afghan-Americans but are not formally connected, although their concept, menus and prices are similar. The multitude of owners has caused problems for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in New York; since the 1990s Kentucky Fried Chicken has tried to enforce trademark rights against some of the Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurants, many of which used the initials \\"KFC\\", and have been known to decorate their restaurants in red and white colors similar to Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. = Trademark controversy = In 2005 Abdul Haye, an Afghan immigrant since 1989 and a resident of Whitestone, Queens in New York City, registered Kennedy Fried Chicken as a trademark. He has been attempting to enforce the trademark against other restaurants with mixed results.

Bantam Books) The Tin Man is a 1998 novel by best-selling American writer Dale Brown. In the novel, Patrick McLanahan, a recurring character in Brown's books, returns from overseas conflict to his hometown, Sacramento, California. There he encounters an old enemy whose evil plot forces McLanahan to take a terrible chance as he employs experimental technology to make himself a human weapon. Using BERP armor, and (chiefly) nonlethal weapons, he attacks Methamphetamine-producing Biker gangs, after his brother (a rookie cop) is severely injured. The chief technology is a high- tech battlesuit that utilizes the newly developed BERP armor. This stands for Ballistic Electro-Reactive Process and was developed by Doctor Jon Masters, another recurring character in the McLanahan series of books. This technology essentially harnesses electricity to instantly harden whatever surface it is applied to, in this case-the fabric of a combat suit. This allows it to stop bullets or other attacks as if the suit were made of steel. The only requirement is that the item being stopped must be moving at high speed. Jet thrusters in the boots also allow the wearer to jump hundreds of feet in a single leap, or to break a high fall. In later novels of the McLanahan series, the men who use this battle armor are called Tin Men. These novels include Warrior Class, Wings of Fire, Air Battle Force, and Plan of Attack. In these later novels, other additions are made to the suit such as a Powered exoskeleton, a magnetic railgun, targeting systems and so on.

The game is followed by Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 (Ricky Ponting International Cricket 2007 in Australia and New Zealand and Yuvraj Singh International Cricket in India). Details This game is the follow-up to Brian Lara Cricket '99 (also known as Shane Warne Cricket '99 in Australia and New Zealand). It contains the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Africa and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. These two competitions are licensed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and contain official player names, faces, kits, badges and sponsors. All other modes are unofficial as the rights for these belong to EA Sports and therefore some players and kits are made up; for example Graham Thorpe becomes \\"G Thrip\\" and Shane Warne becomes \\"S Worde\\". The only correct names in these modes are Brian Lara himself, (shown as \\"B Lara\\"), and Australian Captain Ricky Ponting (similarly shown as R Ponting).Although in the ICC events the names of the players are spelled correctly. The game is also first to include licensed bats such as the Kookaburra Diablo and the GM Purist. The game takes the perspective of the normal cricket TV coverage, other views and displays in the game also try to emulate TV coverage of cricket, for example Hawk-Eye, an electronic system used to track cricket balls as they are bowled is featured in the game.The Hawk-Eye system used in the game Game modes There are a few types of cricket that can be played in the game. Test match, Test series, One Day match, World Cup, ICC Champion's Trophy and practice mode. Along with the types of cricket there are several difficulty settings. Slog mode, village, county and test. With each difficulty bowling and batting decreases in ease. The game also offers the player to construct their own team from cricketers already in the game, and to construct their own \\"Career Players\\" who gain experience with each match. There is also a \\"Classic XI\\" mode, which has famous cricketers of the past such as W.G. Grace, Imran Khan and Jim Laker. =Challenges= There are also a challenge mode in the game, where the player can take on cricketing challenges based on notable cricket matches from the past. The player can either recreate or rewrite history, depending on the team they choose to play as. These include such matches as The birth of The Ashes, the 1933 Bodyline test match, Garfield Sobers' six sixes, and the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup final. There are 10 challenges in total. Reaction and criticism Reaction from the public and critics was very good with ratings averaging around 7.5 out of 10.Reviews of Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 on gamerankings.com Most criticism is of the player designs not resembling the actual people, which is a licensing issue. There is also a problem with the wicket keeper who doesn't wear a helmet like in many other cricket games.Although in the ICC events the players look like they do in real life. Some other shortcomings include no overthrows and running on overthrow, batsman cannot come down the track to hit or defend, the ball is always thrown to the wicketkeeper rather than at the stumps or to the bowler leaving balls driven to midoff easier to run on, and leaving the ball without playing a shot reduces the batsman's confidence. Batting and bowling averages of players do not evolve with play, unless the player has created a career player.

Oracle and IBM DB2 provide a construct explicitly named CLOB, and the majority of other database systems support some form of the concept, often labeled as text, memo or long character fields. CLOBs usually have very high size-limits, of the order of gigabytes. The tradeoff for the capacity is usually limited access methods. In particular, some database systems limit certain SQL clauses and/or functions, such as LIKE or SUBSTRING from being used on CLOBs. Those that permit such operations may perform them very slowly. Alternative methods of accessing the data are often provided, including means of extracting or inserting ranges of data from the CLOB. Database systems vary in their storage patterns for CLOBs. Some systems always store CLOBs as a reference to out-of-table data, while others store small CLOBs in-table, changing their storage patterns when the size of the data grows beyond a threshold. Other systems are configurable in their behavior.

It also features Julie Brown, Blake Clark, Paul Dooley, Kathy Griffin, Florence Henderson, Tom Kenny, Adam Sandler, Scott Herriott, LaWanda Page, Jack Gallagher, and a cameo by Robin Williams as Mime Jerry using the pseudonym \\"Marty Fromage\\". Plot The film is a dark comedy about a birthday-party clown (Goldthwait) in the grip of depression and alcoholism, who is framed for murder. Different communities of clowns, mimes and other performers are depicted as clannish, rivalrous subcultures obsessed with precedence and status. This was Goldthwait's bitter satire of the dysfunctional standup comedy circuit he knew as a performer.

Critical reaction to the movie was mixed: Leonard Maltin gave it his lowest rating, while Betsy Sherman of The Boston Globe called it \\"the Citizen Kane of alcoholic clown movies\\". Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, writing that while some isolated scenes were \\"very funny\\" the plot was scattered and the performances often seemed under-rehearsed. The film has a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews, with the consensus; \\"Shakes the Clown has a handful of memorable moments, but they're scattered in a movie whose best ideas were left undeveloped on their way to the screen.\\" The film was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1991 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Nothing but Trouble. In an interview with Conan O'Brien, Goldthwait revealed that Martin Scorsese had defended the movie from detractors. When a film critic derided the movie in order to make a point about good and bad movies, Scorsese revealed, \\"I like Shakes the Clown. Haven't you heard? It's the Citizen Kane of Alcoholic Clown Movies!\\" ReferencesIn popular culture A sample from this movie was used in the song Interloper by the heavy metal band Slipknot. The song Binky the Doormat by R.E.M., from the album New Adventures in Hi-Fi, is titled after a supporting character of this movie.

In its literal sense it means \\"to consider something good\\". Muslim scholars may use it to express their preference for particular judgements in Islamic law over other possibilities. It is one of the principles of legal thought underlying scholarly interpretation or ijtihad. A number of disputes existed amongst the classical jurists over this principle with the Hanafite jurists adopting this as a secondary source. Contemporary proponents of liberal movements within Islam have used istihsan and the similar idea of istislah (Arabic for \\"to deem proper\\") as ethical principles to favour feminist and reformist interpretations of the Qur'an and Sunnah, thus looking to reform Islamic law. Etymology ' ( ) is an Arabic word derived from the word al-husn () which means good which is the opposite meaning of al-qubh () which means bad. The word ' is used to express \\"decorating or improving or considering something good\\".Mohd Hafiz Jamaludin and Ahmad Hidayat Buang \\"Syariah Courts in Malaysia and the Development of Islamic Jurisprudence: The Study of Istihsan\\" International Journal of Nusantara Islam 1, no. 1 (2014): 2.. It also applies to mean something towards which one is inclined or which one prefers, even if it is not approved by others.Nyazee, Islamic Jurisprudence, 2000, p. 231 Technically it has been defined in several ways by Muslim jurists: * Bazdawi defines it as moving away from the implications of an analogy to an analogy that is stronger than it.al-Bazdawi, Usul al-Bazdawi * Al-Halwani defines it as giving up an analogy for a stronger evidence from the Quran, Sunnah or ijma. * The Maliki jurist, Ibn al-Arabi defines it as sacrificing some of the implications of an evidence by way of exception. * Al-Karkhi defines Istihsan as follows: Istihsan is when one takes a decision on a certain case different from that on which similar cases have been decided on the basis of its precedents, for a reason which is stronger than one found in similar cases and which requires departure from those cases.Saim Kayadibi, Doctrine of Istihsan (Juristic Preference) in Islamic Law, (Konya: Tablet Kitabevi, 2007), 104. Types of Istihsan A number of categorisations have been employed by the jurists: * Istihsan through the text (nass) * Istihsan on the basis of consensus (ijma) * Istihsan on the basis of what is good (maruf) * Istihsan on the basis of necessity (darurah) * Istihsan on the basis of benefit (Maslahah) * Istihsan on the basis of analogy (qiyas khafi) Examples of Istihsan The following comprise classical examples for this principle: * Abu Hanifah stated that the one who eats out of forgetfulness whilst fasting should repeat the fast - however he moves away from this by the evidence of a narration that allows the fast to stand.Abd al-Aziz al-Bukhari, Kash al-Asrar, Vol 4,7 * Analogy requires that the manufacturing contract with advance payment be prohibited on the basis of analogy - however this is made permissible according to ijma. * Analogy requires that pure water be used for ablution so wells in which dirt or carcasses of animals have fallen would be prohibited for use according to strict analogy. Necessity exceptionalises this and permits the use of this water provided formal cleaning methods are applied first. Criticisms Al-Shafi'i viewed the practice of juristic preference as a heretical usurping God's sole right as the legislator of Islamic law.Al- Shafi'i, Kitab al-Umm, vol. 7, pg. 309-320. Cairo Dar al-fikr, 1990. It has been alleged that this criticism revolves more around the linguistic meaning of the term rather than its technical meaning, though modern scholarship regards Shafi'is comments as a direct criticism of the technical meaning.Bernard G. Weiss, The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi, pg. 672. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1992. Malik ibn Anas is noted to have been asked about binding divorce. When he delivered his response, a disciple of his quickly reached for a tablet to make note of this ruling. Upon realizing what his disciple was doing, Malik asked him to stop, remarking that his opinion could change before nightfall.Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.156. Sarakhsi points out that some jurists have criticised Istihsan on the grounds that the analogy is being given up for personal opinion, something prohibited in Islam. He refutes this understanding as incomprehensible, as no jurist would give up an authority for something that lacked evidence.al- Sarakhsi, Kitab al-Usul ReferencesFurther reading * Kamali, Mohammad Hashim.

It is a flat, pectin-based, fruit- flavored snack rolled into a tube, spread on a backing sheet of cellophane to prevent the product from sticking to itself. Fruit Roll-Ups are manufactured by General Mills and distributed under the Betty Crocker brand in the American market and under the Uncle Tobys brand in Australia. Several similar products have been marketed by General Mills and by other companies, notably under the Kellogg's brand in the UK as Fruit Winders.  Advertising  Fruit Corners Fruit Roll-Ups were heavily marketed on television in America throughout the early 1980s. Most spots featured the tag line \\"Fruit Corners Fruit Roll-Ups: Real fruit and fun, rolled up in one.\\" Later spots featured children innovating in the \\"Fruit Roll-Up Fun Factory\\". The overall marketing theme is that parents can feed their children \\"fun\\" processed foods that are based on real fruit. Studies of American mothers have shown that the mothers are surprised at how sweet Fruit Roll-Ups are and how little fruit is present in them. For example, the strawberry flavor contains no strawberries, and the only ingredient derived from fruit is the sugar present in concentrated pear juice.  History  General Mills' research for the product began in 1975. Joray Fruit Rolls are a round, fruit leather product from New York that predates Fruit Roll-Ups. Fruit Roll-Ups have a more rubbery texture than the natural rolls and though were originally round in shape, they are now shaped like a parallelogram. Fruit Roll-Ups have featured variants on the original plain sheets such as punch out shapes on the rolls and temporary tattoos for tongues and formerly on skin. * Berry Lemonade/Cherry Slushie *Crazy Pix Cool Chix Berry Wave *Crazy Pix Wild Ones Blastin' Berry *Electric Blue Raspberry *Flavor Wave *Rainbow *Little Banana *Strawberry Kiwi Kick *Amazing Cherry *Sunberry Burst *Electric Yellow *Screamin' Green *Lemon Lime *Pink Lemonade *SpongeBob SquarePants: Tropical Punch *Franken Berry and Boo Berry (Sold seasonally at Halloween) Betty Crocker sells Fruit Roll-Ups in single-flavor boxes and flavor variety packs.  Ingredients  The main ingredient is sugar, and Fruit Roll-Ups contain five different types of sugar: sugar from pear juice concentrate, corn syrup, dried corn syrup, sugar, and a small amount of dextrose. They also contain small amounts of partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, citric acid, sodium citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, fruit pectin, malic acid, ascorbic acid, natural flavors, and artificial colors. = Lawsuit over health claims = In 2011, the Center for Science in the Public Interest sued General Mills over Fruit Roll-Ups, saying that their packaging and marketing was misleading because it presented the product as a nutritious, healthful, fruit-filled snack, despite having approximately the same nutritional profile as gummy bear candies. The lawsuit was settled out of court with General Mills agreeing not to put pictures of fruits on the labels, unless that fruit was actually present in that flavor of the Fruit Roll-Up, and to either stop claiming that the product is \\"made with real fruit\\", or to include in that potentially misleading statement the percentage of the Fruit Roll-Up that is made from real fruit. These changes took place in 2014.

In a city famous for its urban planning, the Parkway represents one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the United States. The road was constructed to ease heavy industrial congestion in Center City and to restore Philadelphia's natural and artistic beauty, as part of the City Beautiful movement. The vision for a grand parkway came from retail pioneer John Wanamaker. Preliminary proposals for the Parkway had been produced and added to the City Plan by 1906, but the first comprehensive plan for the Parkway was commissioned in 1907 by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art). The Association commissioned architects Horace Trumbauer, Clarence Zantzinger, and Paul Philippe Cret, who created a detailed parkway design that was formally added to the City Plan in 1909. Construction on the Parkway did not begin until 1917, when French landscape architect Jacques Gréber submitted a revised plan to the Commissioners of Fairmount Park. Gréber designed the Parkway in 1917 to emulate the Champs- Élysées in Paris, France. The route was determined by an axis drawn from City Hall Tower to a fixed point on the hill that William Penn called \\"Fairmount\\", now the site of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Outline History of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 1871-1935. The Champs-Élysées terminates at the Arc de Triomphe, and the Parkway's terminating at the Art Museum gives the notion of \\"a slice of Paris in Philadelphia.\\" The Parkway contains flags of countries from around the world. The traffic rotary on the western end of the Parkway, at the foot of the Art Museum's Rocky Steps, is named Eakins Oval after Philadelphia painter Thomas Eakins. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval originally formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events. Because of its central location, the Parkway is the site for many concerts and parades. On July 2, 2005, the steps of the museum played host to the Philadelphia venue of Live 8, where artists such as Dave Matthews Band, Linkin Park and Maroon 5 performed. The Parkway was also the site of Jay-Z's Made in America Festival on September 1-2, 2012 featuring Jay-Z, Pearl Jam, Skrillex and Calvin Harris, among others. On September 26th and 27th, 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia and the Parkway was flooded with over a million visitors both weekend days, a Celebration of Families on Saturday, and a Holy Mass on Sunday. In recent years, there has been concern that the original plan of a wide, multi-sectioned, multi-laned, tree-lined boulevard, while beautiful to travel on, is not very engaging for pedestrian or other public use. Traffic along the Parkway has decreased considerably because of the completion of Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway), linking the Schuylkill Expressway with the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. In response, the roadway has been narrowed somewhat and the sidewalks expanded around Logan Circle. Various plans for the rest of the Parkway, some of which would insert shops and other smaller structures into the long stretches between museums, have been proposed, but none so far have been thought feasible or financially sound. A new museum for the Barnes Foundation collection of Impressionist art on the site between the Free Library and the Rodin Museum opened in Spring 2012.

Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927 (1995); Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997) which requires law enforcement officers to announce their presence and provide residents with an opportunity to open the door prior to a search. The rule is currently codified in the United States Code,18 U.S.C. § 3109 which governs Fourth Amendment searches conducted by the federal government. Most states have similarly codified the rule into their own statutes,See, e.g., Washington Code Annotated 10.31.040 and remain free to interpret or augment the rule and its consequences in any fashion that remains consistent with Fourth Amendment principles.U.S. v. Scroggins, 361 F.3rd 1075 (8th Cir. 2004) A state's knock- and-announce rule will govern searches by state actors pursuant to state- issued warrants, assuming that Federal actors are not extensively involved in the search. The rule English common law has required law enforcement to knock-and-announce since at least Semayne's case (1604). In Miller v. United States (1958), the Supreme Court of the United States recognized that police must give notice before making a forced entry and in Ker v. California (1963) a divided Court found that this limitation had been extended against the states by the United States Constitution. However, in Wilson v. Arkansas (1995) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a knock-and-announce before entry was a factor that must be considered in reviewing the overall constitutionality of a Fourth Amendment search.514 U.S. 927 (1995) After several state attempts to exclude specific categories (e.g. drug crimes) from the knock-and-announce rule, the Supreme Court in Richards v. Wisconsin prohibited the policy, and demanded a return to a case-by-case review scenario.520 U.S. 385 (1997) The Richards Court suggested that the knock and announce rule could be dispensed with only in certain circumstances, for example where police have reasonable suspicion that an exigent circumstance exists. The Court read its earlier Wilson opinion to suggest that such circumstances might include those: *which present a threat of physical violence *where there is \\"reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if advance notice were given\\" *where knocking and announcing would be dangerous or \\"futile\\" The Court expressly stated that whether reasonable suspicion exists depends in no way on whether police must destroy property in order to enter.U.S. v. Ramireèz, 523 U.S. 65 (1998). In a similar manner, where officers reasonably believe that exigent circumstances, such as the destruction of evidence or danger to officers will exist, a no-knock warrant may be issued.Memorandum Opinion for the Chief Counsel, Drug Enforcement Administration, from Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Authority of Federal Judges and Magistrates to Issue \\"No-Knock\\" Warrants, 26 Op. O.L.C. 44 (June 12, 2002).See, e.g., U.S. v. Segura-Baltazar 448 F.3rd 1281, (11th Cir. 2006) However, despite police awareness that such future exigencies will exist, they are generally not required to seek such a warrant;See, e.g., U.S. v. Musa, 401 F.3d 1208 (10th Cir. 2005) in this case, police must have an objectively reasonable belief, at the time of executing the warrant, that such circumstances do in fact exist.U.S. v. Maden, 64 F.3rd 1505 (10th Cir. 1995) The Supreme Court has given some guidance as to how long officers must wait after knocking and announcing their presence before entry may be made. In U.S. v. Banks,540 U.S. 31 (2003) the Supreme Court found 15 to 20 seconds to be a reasonable time where officers received no response after knocking and where officers feared the home occupant may be destroying the drug evidence targeted by the search warrant. As with most other things in the Fourth Amendment arena, the Court left reasonableness of the time period to be determined based on the totality of the circumstances;U.S. v. Jenkins, 175 F.3d 1208, 1213 (10th Cir. 1999) (stating the Supreme Court has not established a clear cut standard to determine the amount of time officers must wait). and thus inferior Federal courts have found even shorter time periods to be reasonable.See, e.g., U.S. v. Cline, 349 F.3d 1276 (10th Cir. 2003) Some different factors have been propounded by lower courts to guide the analysis of a reasonable wait period.U.S. v. Chavez-Miranda, 306 F.3rd 973 (9th Cir. 2002) A few examples are: *the size, design, and layout of the premises *the time of day the search is being executed *the nature of the suspected offense (in particular, does it involve evidence easily destroyed? Is the suspect dangerous?) *the evidence demonstrating guilt. Federal courts also recognize that consent may vitiate part or all of the rule. For example, where officers knock, but before announcement are invited in, they no longer need to announce.U.S. v. Hatfield, 365 F.3d 332 (4th Cir. 2004) Effects of the rule In Hudson v. Michigan (2006), the divided Supreme Court ruled that a violation of the knock-and-announce rule does not require the suppression of evidence using the exclusionary rule. That is primarily because the goals served by a knock-and-announce policy tend to be lesser than other requirements, such as the warrant requirement, of a valid Fourth Amendment search, but the latter is to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy in a person's body, papers, and effects (among other things), the knock-and- announce rule is designed only to provide a brief moment of privacy for an individual to compose himself before a valid search occurs, to prevent an individual from mistakenly believing that police are common intruders and thus endangering them and to prevent property damage from a forcible entry.U.S. v. Banks, 282 F.3d 699 (9th Cir. 2002) Because police with probable cause and a valid warrant are already entitled to an entry and search, violation of the simple knock-and-announce rule has not been deemed grave enough in the federal courts or in most states to justify suppression of the evidence. Most states have composed their own statutes, which require a knock and announcement before making a warranted entry. Because the states are free to offer more liberty to criminal defendants than the US Constitution, the states remain free to impose the exclusionary rule for a violation of the knock-and-announce rule. The Supreme Court opinion in Hudson is necessarily binding only on searches conducted by the federal government.  In popular culture  In July 2020, the podcast Criminal released an episode called \\"Knock and Announce\\" about the 2015 police raid on Julian Betton's apartment in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England and Cheshire, and at club level for Runcorn RFC, and Birkenhead Wanderers, as a fullback, i.e. number 15. and representative level rugby league (RL) for Cheshire, and at club level for Runcorn RFC, who he rejoined in January 1896, and who had switched to professional rugby league in 1895. International honours Sam Houghton was born in Runcorn, Cheshire, England, and he also died in Runcorn, Cheshire, England. International honours Sam Houghton won first selected to play for England (RU), while representing Runcorn at club level, for the encounter against Ireland in the 1892 Home Nations Championship. Despite England winning 7–0, Houghton was replaced for the next match of the tournament by Thomas Coop, who himself was uncapped before the match. It would take almost four years for Houghton to win his second cap, when he was chosen for the 1896 Home Nations Championship. This was a key match for England, as it was the first international after the formation of the Northern League, and the selectors were now unable to call upon a large number of former players who had now turned professional. Houghton by this time had switched clubs from Runcorn to Birkenhead Wanderers, and on 4 January 1896 he was called upon to face Wales in the opening game of the Championship, the match was a one-sided affair after the talented Welsh three-quarters, Owen Badger, broke his collar bone within the first fifteen minutes and was forced to leave the pitch. England went on to win 25–0. Despite being called back into the England team, and then being selected for the second match of the 1896 Championship against Ireland, Houghton switched codes before the 1 February fixture, joining his old club Runcorn. Runcorn who were previously a union team had turned professional in 1895, and by signing back to the club, Houghton was now considered a professional footballer, and could therefore never represent a rugby union team at club, county, or country level. Note ESPN states Samuel Houghton's date of birth as 16 August 1870, whereas FreeBMD quotes the birth as being registered during first ¼ 1870.

It was founded in 1974 by John Loder, and came to be the recording studio of choice for Crass and their record label Crass Records.Rimbaud, Penny. Obituary: John Loder, The Guardian. 2005. Southern Studios Ltd. continues to grow its label and provide label management and distribution services throughout Europe. Background In the 1980s, Southern Studios Ltd. (SSL) evolved into its own record label and distribution company, trading under the name of Southern Records. With the growth of business, the need to expand into other areas of the music business became apparent, thus Southern Record Distributors Ltd.

During the massive growth of the independent music industry in the mid-1990s, Loder decided to establish Southern Records Inc.

The show featured Francesa and Russo talking about sports and taking phone calls from listeners. From 2002 the show was simulcast on television on the YES Network. On the radio, the show was simulcast beginning 2007 on WQYK in Tampa, Florida and from 2004 until 2007 on WROW in Albany, New York.http://blog.timesunion.com/business/mike-and-the-mad-dog-lose-wrow- spot/2499/ History Before Mike and the Mad Dog = Before Francesa and Russo were paired, Russo was an overnight/weekend and fill-in host. He caught the attention of Don Imus, who was impressed with his vibrant personality and brought Russo onto the Imus in the Morning show as its sports reporter. Meanwhile, Francesa was a midday and weekend host at WFAN, and was known to be knowledgeable but somewhat dry on-air. Like Russo, Francesa got the attention of Imus when he made an on-the-air bet with Francesa that Seton Hall University's basketball team would not make the Final Four in the NCAA tournament. Imus promised Francesa a new Porsche if Seton Hall made the Final Four, which they did. Though Imus found a way around the bet, the dialogue between the two is considered to be among the classic moments in the history of Imus in the Morning.Jim Reed (1999), Everything Imus: all you ever wanted to know about Don Imus, Birch Lane Press, pp. 65–66, ().Jack Craig (1990-03-30), CBS' Francesa is plainly a success basketball, football expert defies network standards for appearance, accent, The Boston Globe. =Paired together= In August 1989, WFAN (which was owned at the time by Emmis Communications) was looking for hosts to replace the controversial Pete Franklin in the afternoon drive time period. Mark Mason, then the program director, floated the idea of teaming Francesa with Russo. At first, the station management thought the idea was crazy because they were no-names at that time. However, because of Francesa and Russo's popularity on the weekends and on Imus in the Morning individually, the station management decided to pair the two together. The show was dubbed Mike and the Mad Dog and debuted on September 5, 1989.Tim Sullivan (2013), Imus, Mike and the Mad Dog, & Doris from Rego Park: The Groundbreaking History of WFAN, Triumph Books, Chapter 3, pp. 46 (). However, the decision to pair them on an afternoon show was a surprise to the two men, and a risk. Things were rocky at first. According to Francesa, :“We had a tough beginning. It was a shotgun marriage. We didn’t get along very well, and we were kind of thrown together. Although, I think the thing that changed everything was how quickly the ratings were off the charts. By spring, nine months into the show, we were No. 1 — and No. 1 in a big way — and we realized that no matter what we did, we weren’t going to get away from each other.” While Francesa's brand of sports commentating was considered hard-hitting and serious, Russo's was considered lighter, unconventional, and more entertaining. Regarding the prior perception, Russo said, :\\"I’ve always said it: Mike is a lot funnier, and a lot wittier, than people thought. And Chris was a lot more knowledgeable and sharp, sports-wise, than people thought. So I think that combination, at times, got a little overrated—that Mike was the encyclopedic one, and Dog was the goofy one. Which I think that was the perception for a long time. After a while, they realized, hey, Mike’s funny! And Dog knows what he’s talking about! Once that was established, I think the show was sharp.\\" The show became a staple of the New York sports scene. Francesa says, \\"We always brought that intensity, that bravado, that fierce individual personality to our show, and that's what I thought made it so good.\\" George Vecsey of The New York Times once described Russo's voice as \\"a bizarre mixture of Jerry Lewis, Archie Bunker and Daffy Duck.\\" His voice has also been described as \\"Donald Duck on steroids.\\" Both Francesa and Russo credited Imus for making the pairing possible. Russo said, \\"Imus was very, very, very, very important to the development of FAN... He solved a lot of problems for the company.\\" Francesa said, \\"Without Imus, there's no Mike and the Mad Dog, there's no FAN, and I'm telling you, there's no format... Dog and I came through the toughest school there is: the Imus school of radio.\\" =Broadcast times= Originally it was broadcast weekdays from 3:00 to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Because of its popularity, WFAN extended its starting time twice, first to 2:00 p.m., and then to 1:00 p.m. At the end of its run, the program aired from 1:00 to 6:30 p.m. on WFAN, WQYK in Florida,http://www.sternfannetwork.com/xen/index.php?threads/official-mike- the-mad-dog-thread-heard-on-wfan-wrow-wqyk-yes-network.294514/ and the YES Network. =Mike and the Mad Dog in the morning= In the wake of Imus' firing in April 2007, Mike and the Mad Dog was also broadcast in the mornings from 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. for two weeks between April 16 and April 27, and again on May 21 and May 22, 2007. The afternoon portion of the show ran from 2:00 through 6:30 p.m. The morning portion of the show was nationally syndicated and news-oriented. While in the morning drive slot, they inherited some of the staff from Imus in the Morning, including news anchor Charles McCord, sports anchor Chris Carlin and engineer Lou Rufino. The syndicated broadcast was available to the handful of former Imus in the Morning affiliates who had not had a chance to pick a new morning show. Francesa and Russo hosted the morning drive program several more times, either together or taking turns solo, until Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton took over the timeslot with their show on September 4, 2007. =End of the run= On June 22, 2008, sports columnist Neil Best of Newsday reported that Francesa and Russo were considering ending their radio show. The reports stated that the relationship between the radio duo had soured during Spring 2008, and was the likely cause of the split. Although Russo's contract with WFAN ran until October 2009, Francesa's contract situation was unclear at that time. Newsday contacted Francesa on vacation, where he stated \\"no comment\\". On June 23, Russo, doing the show alone, denied the rumors. He said that he and Francesa had been \\"fighting like cats and dogs\\" until early May, but that their relationship had since improved. \\"Nineteen, 20 years, you're going to have your issues occasionally\\", he said. \\"You gotta get through those issues.\\" Some fans have suggested that the rumors were created as a contract negotiation ploy or a publicity stunt. On June 27, 2008, Francesa acknowledged the show was at a \\"crossroad\\", and could not guarantee the show would last through the summer. Francesa also stated he and Russo had not spoken since reports of their possible breakup came out. On July 11, 2008, Francesa and Russo reunited for their first show together since news of their possible breakup came out. They did their show from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for the DHL All-Star Fan Fest. They would do three more shows together around All-Star weekend. Both Francesa and Russo were coy about their future beyond the summer. Reunited and it Needed an Enema – Mike and the Mad Dog Return On August 5, 2008, they would do their final show together at the New York Giants' training facility in Albany, New York.http://www.giantsfootballblog.com/2008/08/05/mike-and-the-mad-dog-at- giants-camp/ On August 14, 2008, Russo reached a mutual agreement with WFAN to let him out of the remainder of his contract. Russo insisted it was solely a personal decision and said, \\"This has nothing to do with Mike and I hating each other... This is about doing something different. I'm 48 years old and there are not going to be too many more opportunities to break away. It's time to try something else, but it was a tough decision to make.\\" On August 15, 2008, Russo phoned Francesa on the show to say goodbye. A highly emotional Russo began to break down on air as he talked about his partnership with Francesa. =Separate ways= At the same time, while Russo left WFAN, Francesa signed a five-year deal to stay at WFAN and continue to host the afternoon drive-time show called Mike'd Up: Francesa on the FAN. On August 19, 2008, Russo signed a five-year contract worth about $3 million per year with Sirius XM to host an afternoon show called Mad Dog Unleashed and headline a new sports talk channel called Mad Dog Radio on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. Russo said there was nothing WFAN could have done to keep him after Sirius XM provided him an opportunity to not only do a show, but have his own channel, which he could not pass up. =Reflections= In an interview with Best on November 19, 2008, Francesa insisted that there was no smoking gun, no juicy, untold key regarding the breakup with Russo. However, Francesa believed a contributing factor was a fallout from Imus' firing in April 2007 because Russo wanted to pursue the morning slot alone, but the WFAN management was hesitant to break up the pairing. Francesa sensed that Russo was disappointed. Francesa said, \\"In retrospect, I think it set us off on a bad path that last year. I don't mean that caused Dog to leave. He left because he had an opportunity ... But we had a very rocky last year. I think what might have caused some of that was his feeling, stronger than I knew at the time, that he wanted to go to mornings more than I did.\\" In reflection, Francesa said, \\"We had 20 years of something that was great. We're linked forever. That's just life. So the idea that people want to paint Mike vs. Mad Dog, who's the good guy, who's the bad guy? You know what? There is no bad guy.\\" In another interview with Jerry Barmash on June 29, 2012, regarding Russo leaving the show, Francesa said, \\"I didn’t begrudge him leaving for one second. I never had an issue with that. It just wasn’t handled properly, which I think he now understands it and would readily admit.\\" Francesa said he and WFAN operations manager Mark Chernoff got word through back channels of Russo's plan three months before it was made public. But Russo kept quiet until the end. Russo declined to be interviewed. In an interview with Bob Raissman on June 30, 2012, Russo said that the decision to part ways with Francesa was the biggest one of his life, which was made by himself. He still asked, \\"You think I did the right thing?\\" Russo said, \\"It's almost like in the last four years, it's almost like I’ve forgotten I was at FAN for so long. This (Sirius/XM's Mad Dog Radio) is a different kind of element, a different kind of show. It's all- consuming. It's so different than what I was used to\\", Russo said. \\"You forget what you accomplished in that 20-year period. It's almost like I forget I was at FAN for 20 years.\\" In the same interview with Raissman, Russo did not rule out a reunion with Francesa. Russo said, \\"You never want to say never. You know how the radio business is. So, you never say never, but I haven’t thought about it in my crystal ball, let's put it that way... But I’ll tell you right now, if Mike and I did shows together we would have no trouble picking right up where we left off.\\" In the Rolling Stone interview on July 13, 2017, Francesa said, \\"We were two individuals who, in our core, always thought we could be enormously successful without the other one... People feel very personal about the radio people they listen to. You become a part of their life... I've had guys come up to me on the street and say, 'I didn't have a dad, you raised me.'\\" Francesa came back from his 2017 retirement after 4 months to begin hosting afternoon drive on WFAN, which he did until December 2019. The un-retirement was criticized by Russo, reflecting after Francesa's second retirement announcement that he never should have returned, calling his decision \\"unhealthy\\" and revealing that the two had not spoke outside of aired reunions for almost a decade. In response to the criticism, Francesa mocked Russo's career, saying that “Dog spent a lot of time opining on my career in the last 10 years; I’ve never once given an opinion about his — not once. It’s something he spends a lot of time doing”. The two former hosts have not had an official reunion since the 2016 Radio City event, and have not appeared in media together since March 2018 for a brief MLB Network appearance, which Russo said was the last time they spoke at all. =On-air reunions= On the eve of Russo's 50th birthday, Francesa made a surprise appearance on Mad Dog Unleashed on October 15, 2009. The following day, Francesa and Russo teamed up for a one-hour reunion show on Mike'd Up: Francesa on the FAN at 1 p.m. and then again on Mad Dog Unleashed from 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. at Yankee Stadium before the first game of the 2009 American League Championship Series, where both were broadcasting their separate shows in adjacent booths. Russo said that although he loved working at Sirius, he missed talking sports with Francesa. On January 31, 2012, Francesa and Russo met on the air at the Radio Row at Super Bowl XLVI. Russo was standing near the WFAN table at around 1:40 p.m. when Francesa invited him to come on. Francesa then went on Russo's show at 6:30 p.m. On June 29, 2012, Francesa had Russo on the air for a segment to finish off a celebratory week in honor of the 25th anniversary of WFAN. On December 3, 2015, Francesa and Russo had their radio shows simulcast on both WFAN and SiriusXM Satellite Radio for a commercial-free 40 minutes. During the simulcast, they announced that Mike and the Mad Dog would reunite for a one- time-only fundraising show at Radio City Music Hall on March 30, 2016. The proceeds would go to the Garden of Dreams Foundation, which benefits programs and charities that help children facing various obstacles, including physical and financial. On January 12, 2016, Francesa announced that the March 30 reunion show would be simulcast on MSG+ TV, WFAN and SiriusXM. On March 30, 2016 – Francesa and Russo hosted the reunion show at Radio City Music Hall. Among the highlights: * Guests: Tom Coughlin, Joe Torre, Mark Messier, Bobby Valentine and Jeff Van Gundy in the show appearance order. * Francesa and Russo mentioned that the two went two and a half months on-air together without ever otherwise talking to each other due to when Russo wanted to go to Indiana to do a show onsite for a Knicks-Pacers series during the 2000 NBA Playoffs, but Francesa did not. Their first flight got canceled, and instead of waiting for another one that would have had a layover in DC, Francesa declined to go. The standoff ended when Francesa's wife Roe invited Russo to Francesa's wedding. * When answering an audience member's question of whether Francesa and Russo would ever regularly do a radio show together again, Francesa said, \\"Never say never.\\" On June 24, 2016, Francesa and Russo had their radio shows simulcast on both WFAN and SiriusXM Satellite Radio for half an hour (beginning at 4 p.m. ET) to promote their candidacy for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame. On February 2, 2017, Francesa and Russo met on the air at the Radio Row at Super Bowl LI for 45 commercial-free minutes from Russo’s SiriusXM set. On July 6, 2017, Francesa and Russo attended the SiriusXM Town Hall meeting moderated by actor Chazz Palminteri, a week before a 30 for 30 documentary on Francesa and Russo went on the air. Regarding the possibility of reunions, Francesa says, \\"“first, someone has to make an offer, which no one has yet. But if something comes up, I’ll always listen.” And Russo says, \\"I think we both know we could easily do shows together. I think it would be sporadic — maybe one day a week, maybe something around big events.\\" On November 15, 2017, Russo joined Francesa on Francesa's farewell- to-WFAN tour with an event in his honor dubbed “A Night to Remember” at the Tilles Center on the campus of LIU Post broadcast on WFAN. On December 14, 2017, Russo joined Francesa on Francesa's penultimate show at Paley Center in New York on WFAN to say farewell to Francesa. On March 28, 2018, Francesa joined Russo on Russo's show High Heat on MLB Network for an hour. =Ratings and salaries= Mike and the Mad Dog was No. 1 in the market among men between 25 and 54, which notched a 6.9 share in 2007, up from a 6.2 in 2006. According to New York magazine, Francesa made $1.4 million and Russo made $1.3 million in 2005. Show format and discussions The show started with its theme song and then with Russo's intro. The show involved Francesa and Russo talking and arguing with each other or with callers about sports, and occasionally non- sports topics. They were also known for their hard-hitting questions in interviews with their guests. Francesa was the more cerebral of the pair and Russo would defer to him in most arguments. Russo was known to make bold statements when hosting the show solo but would back down when Francesa was co-hosting. Nevertheless, Russo also exhibited a vast knowledge of sports. One of the show's marketing pitches stated: \\"Some shows report sports scores. We settle them.\\" The pair sometimes left their Astoria, Queens studios to do remote broadcasts from the Super Bowl, pre-season football camps, U.S. Open Tennis Championship (typically Russo hosted these show solo because Francesa is not a tennis fan; see below), the Yankees and Mets' spring training sites, and playoff games for various New York teams. The Mike and the Mad Dog show primarily concentrated on baseball and football. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Francesa said: :\\"As far as changes in the city, baseball has now become year-round. We cover baseball every single day of the year...just look at the back pages in November, December, they have screaming baseball headlines. Baseball has become so dominant in what we do.\\"Michael O'Keeffe (2004-11-14), Mike and the Mad Dog still rapping after all these years, New York Daily News. Basketball and golf were covered to a much lesser extent, but they did receive mention due to the show's strong relationship with Jim Nantz, an acclaimed golf and college basketball broadcaster, plus a few noted college coaches and NBA coaches, reporters, and broadcasters. It is well noted that Russo is a big fan of tennis; and tennis did get some play on their show (much to Francesa's chagrin) generally leading into and then during the four majors. Francesa is an admirer of horse racing, and the program devoted time to racing talk during the Triple Crown season, the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York, and the Breeders' Cup. International sporting events such as the Tour de France got little mention except when there was a scheduled interview or major story. Both Russo and Francesa have admitted to not being experts in hockey, but playoff games involving the local teams were discussed and noted NHL guests sometimes appeared. Boxing was not talked about much, as both hosts consider the sport not to be what it once was. Although Freddy Adu and a few other soccer celebrities did interviews on the show, the FIFA World Cup and the sport itself received little to no attention on the program; the local MLS team, the New York Red Bulls, were rarely mentioned at all. (Russo said in his first book that he played soccer as a teenager, but was not a big fan of the game.) Incidents and controversies While the Mike and the Mad Dog program has been a success, the duo has had their share of problems. Things did not go well at first. Neither of them was happy about the arrangement, and each felt that he deserved his own show. Arguments between the two have spilled onto the air and there were backstage debates about such matters as whose name would come first and which of them would get the power seat—the one facing the control room. Each had an entourage of advisers and friends who pushed him to ask for more. Sometimes Don Imus needled them on his program or walked by them in the hall and said, \\"You are so much better than [the other guy].\\" However, Imus did play peacemaker during several of the more public fights. Regarding the relationship between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, \\"It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce.\\" Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. However, Russo said in an interview, \\"I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and would not want to break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him.\\" However, their relationship got strained again in March 2008. It was reported that Francesa and Russo were considering ending their radio show. Russo admitted that from the end of March through the beginning of May, \\"Mike and I were having a lot of issues. If you're a listener, I don't have to tell you . . . We were fighting like cats and dogs. The tolerance level of each other, Mike to me, me to Mike, was low.\\" But Russo insisted their relationship had improved. Francesa agreed that this was among the worst of their \\"four or five\\" fights over the years. =1991 NCAA Tournament= In 1991, while Francesa was still at CBS Sports hosting the 1991 NCAA Tournament—Russo was very critical of CBS's coverage. The discussion began to gain momentum and soon snowballed over a number of days. CBS was unhappy that Francesa's show was being used as a platform for criticisms of their television coverage, prompting a call from Francesa asking Russo to not discuss the topic. Russo refused and an on-the-air argument followed. Francesa would eventually leave CBS Sports and concentrate on his radio career full- time. =Phil Mushnick accusations= The day after the September 11 attacks, sportswriter Phil Mushnick claimed that the duo had stated, on-air, that all Jewish Americans should take a loyalty oath to the United States. Francesa denied ever making such comments, prompting further criticism from Mushnick. In April 2017, Deadspin reported that a recording of the show from September 12, 2001, had been located in the 9/11 archives of the Paley Center for Media. Deadspin writers listened to the episode, and noted that while Francesa and Russo had argued with an American citizen caller about his loyalty to Israel taking precedence over his loyalty to the United States, the broadcast was not \\"the Jew-bashing trainwreck that New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick described.\\" =Hockey= On the flip side, the duo have always defended each other in the face of adversity. Francesa and Russo have garnered a reputation for not being knowledgeable when it comes to hockey, though Russo later claimed in his first book that he has watched some regular-season NHL games that many hockey writers would be hard-pressed to. Also, long-time NHL television analysts John Davidson and Pierre McGuire had both been semi- regular guests on the show, and Ed Olczyk had made several appearances since joining NBC. In May 1992, Russo went to a New York Rangers game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. When Russo arrived at the game, Rangers fans chided him and he eventually left the game. The next day, Francesa went on the air and blasted the Rangers fans for their behavior. They also allegedly had an on-air spat with long-time hockey writer and broadcaster Stan Fischler, who never did another interview on their show. In 2006, Jaromir Jagr jokingly made fun of their hockey knowledge, to which the duo said that he had sold them on watching more. =\\"ONE TIME!!\\"= The Monday after Russo's favorite baseball team, the San Francisco Giants, were eliminated from the 2003 postseason by the Florida Marlins he went into his most famous tirade.Mad Dog's tirade on SF Giants playoff elimination in 2003 (click link for audio). which YES often replayed in promos. Russo got progressively more and more worked up as his rant continued, to the point where his voice was straining and cracking at the end. His wish eventually came true when the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Since then, San Francisco has won the World Series twice more, in 2012 and 2014. =Doggie going solo: ____ and the Mad Dog= In the summer of 1992, while Francesa was on vacation at the Breakers, in Palm Beach, Florida, Russo jokingly started the show by saying, \\"Welcome to....and the Mad Dog\\", leaving silence where the \\"Mike\\" should have been. Francesa was furious, calling several station bigwigs and demanding an apology. On another occasion, Francesa returned from a vacation a day early, hoping to rejoin Russo on the air; Russo, savoring the solo airtime, accused Francesa of trying to horn in on his time. There was a great deal of shouting, and during a closed-door cool-down meeting with WFAN executives they nearly started throwing punches. =Flight cancellation during 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals= On May 30, 2000, after the New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers on Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, Francesa and Russo intended to board a plane to Indianapolis to host Mike and the Mad Dog there. However, the flight got cancelled and the next flight did not have first class seats available. Since Francesa only rode planes with first class seats, he walked away from the airport and went to the studio. This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or even look at each other, during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something out because he refused to work with Russo again when he returned. Without Francesa's knowledge, Francesa's wife Roe sent a wedding invitation to Russo. Francesa said, \\"that was what thawed out the relationship. She saved the relationship... There would have been no Mike and the Mad Dog after 2000 if that had not happened. It’s a true story.\\" =\\"Enter Sandman\\"= When New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera would enter a game, his entrance song was \\"Enter Sandman\\" by Metallica. Rivera's onetime New York Mets counterpart, Billy Wagner, also used \\"Enter Sandman\\" as his entrance music. After Wagner entered one of his first games as a Met – at Shea Stadium against the Washington Nationals on April 5, 2006 – and used \\"Enter Sandman\\" as his entrance music, Francesa, an avid Yankees fan, expressed his anger and discontent, and strongly suggested that Wagner change the song. His argument was that the song belonged to Rivera and Yankee Stadium, and that Wagner was \\"stealing\\" the song and should be forbidden from using it and needed to get some originality. However, Rivera was not bothered by it. After seeing plenty of backlash, Francesa and Russo later tried to downplay it as a \\"tongue in cheek\\" thing that was never serious. However, Phil Mushnick of the New York Post blasted the two for having \\"made complete fools of themselves\\" and for trying to \\"rewrite unforgettable history to have their audience think that they were just kidding around.\\" =Cory Lidle= On October 9, 2006, after the sudden exit of the Yankees from the divisional series, Francesa and Russo took many grievances with so called Yankee dissenters, feeling most strongly about alleged comments made by Yankee starter Cory Lidle. Lidle was lambasted on air about comments that were seemingly directed towards Yankees manager Joe Torre. Lidle called into the station, and a 13-minute heated discussion ensued where Francesa and Russo challenged Lidle's credibility over these unofficial statements made to the media. On October 11, 2006, Lidle and his flight instructor crashed a small plane into a 50-story condominium tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Francesa and Russo quickly went on the defensive, as they were emotionally disturbed and upset by the death of Lidle, whom they had scolded on air two days prior. They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that they were afraid of what their callers would say. In fact, many of the other hosts during their shows received quite a number of phone calls lambasting Francesa and Russo. After the crash, Francesa said, > \\"If I knew he had two days to live, I would've told him to enjoy himself. > ... But you can't do interviews that way. No one in the world thinks that > way. ... And then to think my last words to him were that I don't think > about him very much. You just weigh it very differently now.\\" In a separate interview, Francesa said, > \\"You're not going to make me feel guilty. There have been times when we've > been rude, I'd be crazy not to admit that. ... But this was an interview we > never thought twice about.\\" Russo said to New York Daily News media columnist Bob Raissman, > \\"Do I wish right this second I had a better relationship with Cory Lidle? > Yeah, I absolutely do, (but) you got to do what you got to do. I don't know > what to tell you. You can make the argument that I look like a heel. ... > I've been ripping him for five or six months. Does that make me a bad guy? > I'll let others evaluate that.\\" =Stance on the Imus–Rutgers controversy= Francesa and Russo opened their show on April 10, 2007, by weighing in on the controversy involving Don Imus and the disparaging comments he made the previous Wednesday about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The program began with an airing of statements delivered by team coach C. Vivian Stringer and team captain Essence Carson at a news conference held two hours prior. Mike followed with a monologue, in which he flatly denied rumors of a gag order in effect at WFAN, and confirmed that the decision to air portions of the Rutgers news conference at the top of the show had been made in consultation with program director Mark Chernoff. Francesa went on to clarify that while he had spoken with Imus a few days after the incident in question, his discussions with Imus had no bearing on how he reported the matter on Mike and the Mad Dog. Picking up from Francesa's opening monologue, Russo criticized Imus for failing to submit a public apology within 48 hours of making the offending comments, and found fault with his strategy on both Al Sharpton's radio show and The Today Show of citing his personal accomplishments in raising money for charitable causes like sickle-cell anemia, children's cancer and the plight of wounded veterans of the Iraq War. In Russo's estimation, this stance was \\"defensive.\\" Russo suggested that Imus should have focused on atoning for his comments, rather than on burnishing his record of charitable activism. Both Francesa and Russo were in agreement that Imus, in Francesa's words, \\"went too far\\" in his characterization of the Rutgers women's basketball team. They also agreed with a caller that the statements made by Imus were both \\"racist and sexist.\\" In their opening comments, they pointed out that Imus had made countless remarks during his nearly thirty-five years on the radio that could be perceived as offensive; Russo cited the specific example of Bernard McGuirk's running parody of then-New York Catholic Archbishop Cardinal Edward Egan (and prior to this, Egan's predecessor Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor), speculating that many Catholic listeners may have found this gag offensive. Despite these criticisms, however, both Francesa and Russo balked at the idea that Imus should be fired as host of his nationally syndicated radio program Imus in the Morning. They disagreed, too, that the then proposed two-week suspension was merely, as one journalist had characterized it, \\"a slap on the wrist.\\" On April 12, 2007, Francesa announced in the afternoon that Don Imus had been dismissed by CBS Radio, the parent company of WFAN. This dismissal came on the heels of the permanent cancellation of Imus's telecast on MSNBC the previous day. Both Francesa and Russo criticized both MSNBC and CBS Radio for dismissing Imus in the middle of the annual WFAN radiothon, which supports three prominent children's charities (the Tomorrows Children's Fund, the CJ Foundation for S.I.D.S. and the Imus Ranch). Since Imus was scheduled to host the radiothon the following morning, the immediate dismissal created a serious scheduling complication. Initially, Francesa reported that both he and Russo would host the radiothon in lieu of Imus; however, this plan was soon amended to allow Imus' wife Deidre Imus, and Charles McCord to host instead. For the next two weeks, Francesa and Russo filled in the morning slot. When the morning portion of Mike and the Mad Dog debuted on April 16, Francesa opened the show by saying, \\"We would hope someone would come to their senses and Don would come back in a couple of weeks...We're not saying that's going to happen. We would hope something like that would happen.\\" Later on both Francesa and Russo blasted Tim Russert (No. 1 on the list anointed by Russo), Mike Wallace, Christopher Dodd (\\"The biggest phony\\" by Russo), Keith Olbermann, Harold Ford, Jr., etc. for not supporting Imus. Notable momentsMarconi Award= Francesa and Russo won the 2000 Marconi Award for Major Market Personality of the Year. The announcement was made on September 23 at the 2000 National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Radio Awards Dinner and Show in San Francisco, California. They were the first sports-talk hosts ever to win the award. =Fifteenth anniversary= On December 15, 2004, Francesa and Russo celebrated their fifteenth anniversary on the air from 2 to 7 p.m. This anniversary special was preceded by a special preshow from 1 to 2 p.m. featuring highlights of the past 15 years of Mike and the Mad Dog.Raymond A. Edel (2004-12-10), Dolenz brings a Monkee to WCBS, The Bergen Record. =Twenty-five-hour broadcast= Between June 30, 2005 and July 1, 2005, Francesa and Russo broadcast live for 25 straight hours for the first time ever to raise money for various charities. It started after the completion of the New York Mets game (approximately 5 p.m.) and continued through the next day at 6:30 p.m. The show was broadcast from the Summer Garden at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Notable guests included Tiki Barber and Mark Messier. Through WFAN's one or two radiothons per year, they have also helped raise money for World Hunger Year and the CJ Foundation For SIDS, among other charities. =Live play-by-play= On May 25, 2006, Francesa and Russo broadcast a Major League Baseball game at Shea Stadium between the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets on radio for local charities. Russo did the play-by-play and Francesa did the color analysis except that they reversed the roles during the third and seventh innings. WFAN and the Mets claimed to raise over $40,000 from the event. During the game, when the two were shown on the scoreboard, they were loudly booed by the audience in Shea Stadium, primarily because neither of the two were actually Mets fans.Neil Best (2006-05-26), Mikey and Mad Dog, that wasn't a bad job, Newsday Before Russo and Francesa entered the booth to be broadcasters for the day, Russo mentioned that he was unsure how to correctly score a swinging strike three or a pitch taken called strike three. Russo and Francesa aired on the radio waves, whereas Gary Cohen and Keith Hernandez were the television play- by-play broadcasters. Prior to this event, Francesa and Russo had broadcast several college basketball games for charities. =National Radio Hall of Fame Nominees= June 2016 – WFAN's legendary dynamic duo was nominated for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame. =30 For 30 documentary= A 30 for 30 documentary on Mike & the Mad Dog, originally planned to air in February 2017, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2017. The show was directed by Daniel H. Forer and debuted on the air on ESPN as a one- hour documentary on July 13, 2017. During an interview with The Washington Post, Forer's point in making Mike and the Mad Dog was to show just how big of an impact Francesa and Russo made on a genre that once was foreign to radio listeners but now is a fact of life. According to Forer, :\\"That was one of the things that I wanted to bring out in the show: To share the story of the start of the first all-sports radio station and give a sense of what the show was like for those who had heard of the show but not heard it... It’s like a little-known rock band from England making waves with a top hit over there and you want to hear them over here. The documentary will give [viewers] a chance to see what the fuss was about.\\" Another quote from Forer, :\\"The combustibility, authenticity and passion allowed them to mix up on the show, but they had respect for each other... They are like two great boxers in the ring. They reached such high levels together, highs they couldn’t come close to when they fought other opponents.\\" YES simulcast On March 19, 2002, the newly signed-on YES Network began simulcasting the show. Their program opened with a sports report from Chris Shearn, who also served as producer for the simulcast, and usually played music to block the advertising that is sold on WFAN (YES often returned from commercial before WFAN does). When Francesa and Russo were out of the studio, these outside shows are also recorded live by YES. Beginning in 2007, some of the outside shows have aired in high definition as YES launched a full-time HD channel. During WFAN's 20/20 Sports Flash reports, a selection of sports news was on the screen. Notably, the lead story on-screen (but not always in the actual report), is usually the Yankees or Nets game that will be airing on YES or WWOR-TV later that evening. YES then broadcast the traffic report during rush-hour, but did not have a graphic to illustrate the report. Since the broadcast on YES was a simulcast, there have been times when the show was delayed or pre-empted on WFAN, usually due to New York Mets baseball. Francesa and Russo never did a show specifically for YES, so the network usually showed reruns of its original programming like Yankees Classics, Yankeeography or CenterStage in its place. When both Francesa and Russo had the day off, YES does not broadcast the show, although other WFAN hosts, usually led by Joe Benigno, replaced Francesa and Russo as the hosts of the Mike and the Mad Dog show, complete with theme music. This was apparently because Francesa and Russo were paid additional salary by YES for the show, while other WFAN hosts are not. YES did simulcast with the substitute hosts in its first couple of years. In 2006, the contract with YES was renewed despite the Cory Lidle controversy and some negative things that Russo said about the Yankee organization in the summer of 2006 (including a heated on-air discussion with Yankees general manager Brian Cashman). Francesa and Russo maintained that YES did not censor them on-air. Both they and YES officials have commented that the simulcast likely would have been canceled quickly if YES forced them to not criticize Yankees or Nets management. MSG Network also expressed interest in moving the show from YES. Radio affiliates outside of New York City On July 16, 2007, WQYK in Tampa, Florida began carrying Mike and the Mad Dog, and broadcast the show from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. WQYK also broadcasts select New York Yankees games which do not conflict with home Tampa Bay Rays games. Tampa was the permanent residence of George Steinbrenner, and is the spring training home of the Yankees, and the location of the Class-A Tampa Yankees of the Florida State League. WQYK, like WFAN, is owned by CBS Radio. Between 2004 and 2007, WROW in Albany, New York simulcasted the show. WROW aired the show from 2:00 until 6:00 p.m. Whenever it was either delayed or pre-empted, the station aired a montage of interviews, known as The Best of Mike and the Mad Dog, or alternate news-talk programming such as Dennis Prager. In November 2007, WROW stopped broadcasting the program and replaced the show with Mark Williams. Theme song Each program began with a theme song jingle produced by JAM Creative Productions. The jingle package has been used for nearly the entire run of the show (originally, the theme from the Blues Brothers was used) and it is the only WFAN show not to use the station's standard jingle package. Lyrics below:Recording of theme song Mike and the Mad Dog...Sports Radio 66, W-F-A-N They're talkin' sports, goin' at it as hard as they can, It's Mike and the Mad Dog on the FAN Nothing can get by 'em, turn it on and try 'em, Mike and the Mad Dog, W-F-A-Nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KFKU-rIvHw There was an awkward moment when Jon Bon Jovi was being interviewed for an unrelated topic. At the end of the interview Jon Bon Jovi half-jokingly remarked that they needed a new theme song and that he would write and record them a new one.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920 as a member of the Liberal Party. Born in Neche, North Dakota, Dumas came to Manitoba in 1897. He worked as a construction contractor. In 1898, he married Mary Nisbett. Dumas was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1915 provincial election, defeating a Conservative and an independent Liberal candidate in the constituency of St. Boniface. The Liberal Party won this election, and Dumas served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration for the next five years. He ran for re-election in the 1920 campaign, but finished third against Conservative-Independent candidate Joseph Bernier. In 1935, Dumas moved to California. He died in Saugus, California.

Founded in 1955 as a preparatory school called Justo Sierra Institute (Instituto Justo Sierra), it was initially sponsored by Lions International until 1956, when it renamed as Northwestern Institute of Technology (Instituto Tecnológico del Noroeste). In 1962, Governor Luis Encinas Johnson approved a state law that restructured the institution and gave it its current name. History The institution was the result of the efforts of the community of Cajeme, led by the president of the local chapter of Lions International, Moisés Vásquez Gudiño. After several restructurations, it became a public university in 1964 when it began to offer a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering. By 1976 the program in Business Administration was added and it stopped offering secondary-level education. In 1979 under the administration of Dr. Óscar Russo Vogel, the institution started expansion programs that continued in the 1980s to serve a growing-demand. The main campus (located in Ciudad Obregón) consisted of only five buildings and the Navojoa campus served its students in a leased building. In 1981 the campus added its administration building to its infrastructure. In 1982 main campus added classrooms and the Náinari campus added the unit for Veterinary and Zoology studies.

Essentially it is a Low Mass with organ music playing throughout: part of the so-called alternatim practice. History The French Organ Mass is a classic example of the so-called alternatim practice, a term which indicates a type of liturgy when alternate sections of liturgical items (such as a Mass or a Magnificat) were performed by different forces.Higginbottom, Grove. In organ alternatim practice—and so, in the French Organ Mass—the organist plays when texts would otherwise have been sung.Silbiger 2004, 97. The tradition stemmed from the antiphonal psalmody of the early Western church. In France, organ playing was regulated by printed \\"ceremonials\\", which specified precisely when the organist should play. The surviving ceremonials are all similar in outline, but differ widely in details. A typical organ Mass comprised versets for the ordinary of the Mass except for the Credo (which was to be sung in its entirety).Silbiger 2004, 98. One of the most important extant ceremonials was written in 1662 and regulated the diocese of Paris. According to this ceremonial, the organ begins the Kyrie and alternates with the choir through ninefold repetitions (and so ends the Kyrie as well). After the priest intones the first line of the Gloria, the organ again begins the alternation with the choir. After the final verse of the Gloria (which began at \\"in gloria Dei Patris\\") the organist would accompany the Offertory: this time there is no alternation and the music does not replace the chant as earlier (while there are texts for the Offertory, they are not for the choir). After the Offertory comes the Sanctus, followed by the Elevation, a high point in the liturgy. The Sanctus begins with an organ verse and proceeds in any of the following three ways: * the Benedictus is substituted with an organ verset, and then a second organ solo accompanies the Elevation * the Benedictus is sung, and then the organist accompanies the Elevation * a single organ verset covers both the Benedictus (instead of the singing) and the following Elevation This is followed by the Agnus Dei, which consists of three parts. The organ begins this part of the liturgy and alternates with the choir. At the Holy Communion the music either accompanies the distribution of the elements or at the antiphon played just before that. At the end of the Mass the priest sang the last words, \\"ite missa est\\", and the organist performed the response, \\"Deo gratias.\\" A Psalm verse follows, and sometimes after it there is a \\"sortie\\", a procession.Silbiger 2004, 99. Altogether, an average Mass would comprise about 20 versets. Church contracts that survive from that time show that the organist played not only at every Mass, but also during various other offices and ceremonies. An organist may have been required to play at as many as 400 services a year, which means that much—if not all—of the music was improvised, and the surviving masses can be regarded as models for such improvisations. Musically, the majority of the organ Masses were modelled after the Missa cunctipotens genitor (Mass IV in the modern collection), which contained chant melodies. However, composers differed on how they treated these melodies in their works. The 1662 ceremonial specified that the original melodies had to be clearly audible in certain versets, and in cases when Missa cunctipotens was used, organists generally complied.Silbiger 2004, 101. Composers The following is a list of composers of French organ masses, arranged chronologically by date of publication of their masses. * Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (1632–1714) ** a mass in Second livre d'orgue (1667) * Nicolas Lebègue (1631–1702) ** a mass in Second livre d'orgue (1678) * Nicolas Gigault (c. 1627–1707) ** three masses in Livre de musique pour l'orgue (1685) * André Raison (1640s–1719) ** five masses in Premier livre d'orgue (1688) * François Couperin (1668–1733) ** Messe à l'usage ordinaire des paroisses (1689–90) ** Messe propre pour les couvents de religieux et religieuses (1689–90) * Nicolas de Grigny (1672–1703) ** La Messe in Premier livre d'orgue (1699) * Gaspard Corrette (1670–c. 1733) ** Messe du 8e Ton pour l'Orgue à l'Usage des Dames Religieuses (1703) * Michel Corrette (1707–1795) ** masses of the Troisième livre d'orgue (1756) * Monsieur Le Clerc (fl. 1765-1783) ** 4 masses in the Journal de pièces d'orgue formant huit Magnificat et quatre messes (1780) * Josse-François-Joseph Benaut (1743–1794) ** at least 10 masses in numerous Livres des pièces d'orgue Additionally, an anonymous manuscript (Paris Conservatoire Rés.746, formerly 24827) created around 1680 contains an organ mass by an unknown composer. The manuscript was attributed by Amédée Gastoué to a member of the Geoffroy family, probably Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy, however, according to later research, there is no evidence for such attribution.Apel 1972, 746.

During his term as Minister of Finance, the new Malaysian currency, Malaysian Ringgit was introduced. Early life The only son of Malaysian statesman and MCA founder Tan Cheng Lock, Tan Siew Sin was born on 21 May 1916 in Malacca. He was of Baba heritage and did not speak Mandarin. He was educated at Malacca High School in Malaccahttp://www.tourism-melaka.com/tuntansiewsin.pdf and then at Raffles College in Singapore. Before then, he was also sent by his father to a Girls School, that is Suydaim Girls School which is now the Methodist High School. In 1935, he felt ill and was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. He fully recovered after an operation in Switzerland for treatment. Three years later, he moved on to his higher education in the field of law in England. He never completed his legal studies. Fearing an outbreak of war in Europe, in July 1939 Tun Tan Cheng Lock ordered him and his two sisters to leave London and return to Malacca. On Sept 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, an event that marked the start of World War II. For this reason, He studied only one year of law. He returned from London to take over the family's plantation business in 1939.http://www.malaysia- chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&id;=490931:kuan-yew-my- father-siew-sins-daughter-speaks-up&Itemid;=2#axzz49NPpuwHu Political career Tan Siew Sin was elected a Member of Parliament for Malacca in 1955. He joined the Malaysian cabinet first as minister of trade and industry, and later became the finance minister in 1959. He then took over as president of the MCA in November 1961, and held on to both positions until 1974. Tan was appointed the Deputy Chairman of the Alliance in 1964. He led his party to victory in the 1964 General Election, winning 27 of the 33 parliamentary seats contested. Tan however came under criticism for not pushing for the recognition of Mandarin as an official language and the establishment of a Mandarin language university. In March 1968, Tan proposed setting up the Tunku Abdul Rahman College for Chinese youths who would otherwise be denied an opportunity to tertiary education. The college was formally set up on February 24, 1969. Under Tan's stewardship, the MCA also set up Koperasi Serbaguna Malaysia (KSM), an initiative of MCA Youth based on the cooperative principle. In the 1969 general election, MCA lost more than half its seats to the new, mainly Chinese Malaysian, opposition parties Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan). Tan considered taking the party out of the Alliance but decided against it. In order to regain Chinese support, Tan attempted to broaden the appeal of the party previously seen as a party of the taukeh (tou jia, rich men), and invited professionals to join the party. Other initiatives included the Chinese Unity Movement and the Perak Task Force to help built support in New Villages in Perak. In 1973, Tan Siew Sin requested a position as Deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet reshuffle following the death of Tun Dr. Ismail, but this was refused by Tun Abdul Razak, which angered Tan. Tan retired from politics on 8 April 1974 after undergoing lung surgery. After his resignation he became a financial advisor to the government on economic issues. Business career After his retirement from politics, Tan was nominated chairman of Sime Darby by Tun Hussein Onn. He was also the chairman of United Malacca Rubber Estates, and sat on the boards of a number of companies, including Unitac, Siemens, Pacific Bank, Highlands & Lowlands, and Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance. Death Tan Siew Sin died on 17 March 1988 in Kuala Lumpur, and was buried in the family burial ground in Malacca. His widow, Catherine Lim Cheng Neo, whom he married on February 8, 1947 was an active campaigner for family planning. They had three daughters. In Kuala Lumpur, there is a street, Jalan Tun Tan Siew Sin (formerly Jalan Silang) which was renamed after him in 2003.

Basil and others call him a Libyan from Pentapolis, but this seems to rest on the fact that Pentapolis was a place where the teachings of Sabellius thrived, according to Dionysius of Alexandria, c. 260.Monarchians, New Advent, Catholic Encyclopedia What is known of Sabellius is drawn mostly from the polemical writings of his opponents. History The Catholic Encyclopedia writes: > It is true that it is easy to suppose Tertullian and Hippolytus to have > misrepresented the opinions of their opponents, but it cannot be proved that > Cleomenes was not a follower of the heretical Noetus, and that Sabellius did > not issue from his school; further, it is not obvious that Tertullian would > attack Callistus under a nickname. Sabellius' opposition to the emerging idea of the Trinity led to his excommunication as a heretic by Pope Callixtus I (Callistus) in AD 220. Wace and Bunsen have both suggested that Calixtus' action was motivated more by a desire for unity rather than by conviction. * Wace, H., A Dictionary of Christian Biography: And Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D.

Originally published by Longmans, 1852. Partly reproduced online at Google Book Search Theology Sabellius taught that God was single and indivisible, with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit being three modes or manifestations of one divine Person. A Sabellian modalist would say that the One God successively revealed Himself to man throughout time as the Father in Creation; the Son in Redemption; and the Spirit in Sanctification and Regeneration. (Because of this focus on God's revelation of himself to man, Modalism is often confused with economic Trinitarianism). Modalism This understanding has been called Sabellianism and modalistic monarchianism.Jaroslav Pelikan, The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition (100-600), The University of Chicago Press, 1975, pp.179-181 The suggestion of development and change within the Godhead was seen as contradicting the concept of impassibility. It also stood in contrast to the position of distinct persons existing within a single godhead by representing Father, Son and Spirit as different “modes” (hence the term \\"modalism\\"), “aspects” or “faces”, \\"masks\\" (persona in Latin)pgs 51-55Vladimir Lossky The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () that God presented successively to the world. More importantly it stood against the Trinitarian teaching that \\"God was one God in Father\\" rather than One in the Father's essence only.pgs 51-55 Vladimir Lossky The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () It has been noted also that the Greek term \\"homoousios\\", which Athanasius of Alexandria favored, was actually a term that was reported to be put forth and favored also by Sabellius, and was a term that many followers of Athanasius took issue with and were uneasy about. Their objection to the term \\"homoousios\\" was that it was considered to be \\"un-Scriptural, suspicious, and of a Sabellian tendency.\\"Select Treatises of St. Athanasius - In Controversy With the Arians - Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911, footnote, page 124 This was because Sabellius also considered the Father and the Son to be \\"one substance.\\" By that Sabellius meant that the Father and Son were \\"one essential Person\\", though operating as different manifestations, roles, faces, or modes. Athanasius, however, used the term differently than Sabellius, affirming oneness of the Divine Essence while maintaining the distinctions between the Divine Persons. The term \\"homoousios\\" was accepted, however, at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D., using the Athanasian formula and doctrine, of the Father and Son being distinct persons, though co-eternal, co-equal, and con-substantial. The objections to using the term were addressed by clarifying that it was not being used in the Sabellian sense of oneness of Person, but rather to denote oneness of Essence while affirming the distinctions of the Persons or \\"hypostases\\". Persona According to Epiphanius of Salamis, Sabellius used the sun's characteristics as an analogy of God's nature. Just as the sun has \\"three powers\\" (warmth, light, and circular form), so God has three aspects: the warming power answers to the Holy Spirit; the illuminating power, to the Son; and the form or figure, to the Father.Von Mosheim, J.

Originally published by Trow & Smith Book Manufacturing Co, 1868. Partly reproduced online at Google Book Search Sabellius used the term \\"prosopa\\" which is Greek for \\"faces\\" to describe how the person of God has three faces, this idea is found in 2 Corinthians 4:6 \\"...God’s glory displayed in the face (prosopon - singular form of prosopa) of Christ. God in essence Von Mosheim thus described Sabellius' views: But while Sabellius maintained that there was but one divine person, he still believed the distinction of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, described in the Scriptures, to be a real distinction, and not a mere appellative or nominal one. That is, he believed the one divine person whom he recognized, to have three distinct forms, which are really different, and which should not be confounded.Von Mosheim, J. L., op cit, p218 Non-Trinitarian The Teachings of Sabellius were most vigorously opposed by Tertullian in North Africa and Hippolytus in Rome, who both proposed a hierarchical trinity of subordinate persons.Mattison M. M., Jesus and the Trinity, Auburn University, Alabama Retrieved Oct 7, 2007. Tertullian is reported to have given Sabellius' doctrine the name Patripassianism, meaning ‘the father suffered’, since Sabellius made no true distinction of persons between the Father and the Son. The term is from the Latin words pater for \\"father\\", and passus from the verb \\"to suffer\\", because it implied that the Father suffered on the cross. Tertullian coined the term in his work Adversus Praxeas, ChapterI: \\"By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father.\\" This charge he applied to Sabellius as well.. This is a distortion of Sabellius' teaching according to Clissold, who quotes scholars who have appealed to Epiphanius' writings.Clissold, A., The Creeds of Athanasius, Sabellius and Swedenborg, Adamant Media Corporation, 2001 (originally published by Longmans Green and Co, 1873) Partly reproduced online at The Creeds of Athanasius, Sabellius and Swedenborg: Examined and Compared With Each Other Epiphanius (died 403) says that in his time Sabellians were still numerous in Mesopotamia and Rome - a fact confirmed by an inscription discovered at Rome in 1742, evidently erected by Sabellian Christians.Northcote, J. S., Epitaphs of the Catacombs\\", 1878, p. 102. Cited by Christian Classics Ethereal Library Modern movements Although there are some doctrinal characteristics shared by a modern group called Oneness Pentecostals with those of Sabellius, the former do not teach the exact doctrine of Dispensational Modalism as purportedly taught by Sabellius. Some consider this, however, an unfounded assertion, as we have no writings of Sabellius to definitively prove for one way or another. So it cannot be certain whether Sabellius taught a dispensational Modalism or taught what is known today as the Oneness Pentecostal theology since all we have of his teaching comes through the writing of his enemies. All of his original works were destroyed. For example, the doctrines that were purportedly believed by the Templars have recently been shown to be falsifications. The following excerpts demonstrate some of the known doctrinal characteristics of ancient Sabellians which may compare with the doctrines in the modern Oneness movement. Both movements hold that the Biblical God is one Person, not Three. And that Father, Son, and Spirit are different aspects or manifestations of that one Person, and not three distinct persons. Sabellianism was doctrine adhered to by a sect of the Montanists. The Montanists are the same sect that Tertullian himself was a member of when he wrote (the anti-Sabellian) Against Praxeas. Apparently then, there were both Trinitarian and modalist participants in the Monatism which was later condemned. Cyprian wrote of Sabellians \\"How, when God the Father is not known-nay, is even blasphemed-can they who among the heretics are said to be baptized in the name of Christ only, be judged to have obtained the remission of sins?\\"Cyprian, c. 250, W, 5.383,484 In 225AD Hippolytus spoke of them saying \\"Some of them assent to the heresy of the Noetians, affirming the Father Himself is the Son.\\" Victorinus had this to say of them \\"Some had doubts about the baptism of those who appeared to recognize the same Father with the Son with us, yet who received the new prophets.\\" It is reported that some Sabellians experienced glossolalia (speaking in tongues) and baptized in the \\"shorter formula\\" because of their denial of the Trinity.J.H. Blunt, p.332,Heik, p 150, kelsey, pp. 40,41 Sabellians were referred to by the following Church fathers: Dionysius (c.200-265 AD) wrote \\"Those baptized in the name of three persons...though baptized by heretics..shall not be rebaptized. But those converted from other heresies shall be perfected by the baptism of the Holy Church.\\" St. Dionysius, Letters and Treatises, p.54 \\"Sabellius...blasphemes in saying that the Son Himself is the Father and vice versa.\\" Dionysius of Rome, c.264,W, 6.365 \\"Jesus commands them to baptize into the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-not into a unipersonal God.\\" Tertullian, C. 213,W,3.623 Sabellianism teaching of Modalism and singular name baptism was also accompanied by glossolalia and prophecy among the above-mentioned sect of Montanists. In 225 AD Tertullian speaks of \\"those who would deserve the excellent gifts of the spirit-and who...by means of the Holy Spirit would obtain the gift of language, wisdom, and knowledge.\\" However, none of these practices were the source of controversy concerning the Sabellians - - it was simply their Christology which proved most offensive. In any case, unlike many others deemed as heretics, the Sabellians were never excommunicated from the Church at large. One hundred years later, the Deacon Arius would compare Bishop Alexander to Sabellius, in effect accusing Alexander and Athanasius of reviving an old heresy, that at the very least had Sabellian leanings.

From the late 1880s until after World War II, the company was Canada's largest operator of Atlantic and Pacific steamships. Many immigrants travelled on CP ships from Europe to Canada. The sinking of the steamship just before World War I was the largest maritime disaster in Canadian history. The company provided Canadian Merchant Navy vessels in World Wars I and II. Twelve vessels were lost due to enemy action in World War II including the largest ship sunk by a German U-boat, . The company moved to a model of container shipping from passenger, freight and mail service in the 1960s due to competitive pressure from the airline industry. The company was a part of the Canadian Pacific Ltd. conglomerate. It was spun out as a separate company in 2001. In 2005, it was purchased by TUI AG and is now part of the company's Hapag-Lloyd division. The Atlantic and Pacific passenger liners of Canadian Pacific were always British-flagged and largely British-manned and were not part of the Canadian Merchant Marine, ownership being with the British- registered Canadian Pacific Steamships Ltd. subsidiary. MV CP Ambassador HistoryEarly era (1881–1915)= Advertising booklet, c. 1930. In the early 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) negotiated with the Government of the United Kingdom to establish a trans-Pacific steamship routes between Vancouver, British Columbia and the Far East. The trans-Pacific services of Canadian Pacific were begun by Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, the Canadian- American builder of the railroad network in 1887. In that year, Sir William chartered three vessels from Cunard Line; , , and —as a beginning of the CP fleet. The agency for chartering and managing the ships was secured by Adamson, Bell and Company for the first three years. When the new shipping line had shown to be profitable, Canadian Pacific decided not to renew the contract with Adamson, Bell and Company and to run the line itself. In 1891, CPR adopted a new name — the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company (CPSC). The CPSC became one of the many shipping companies operating in and out of Liverpool. The company expanded as people emigrating from Europe to North America provided a larger number of passengers and the company also started holiday cruises. As with other shipping companies, CPSC had larger ships built to cope with the demand. In the late 19th century, CPR initiated an ocean- going service between the port of Vancouver and Hong Kong, with calls at Japan and China, and later at Manila, Philippine Islands and Honolulu, Hawaii. This service provided a link for CPR's transcontinental railroad passenger and freight services. Passengers could travel from England to Eastern Canada, travel across the railway to Vancouver, and on to Asian destinations. During 1887, temporary steamship service was initiated on a Vancouver-Yokohama-Hong Kong route. From 1887 through 1941, the Canadian Pacific Railway provided steamship service between Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and Hong Kong with calls at Japan and China, and later at Manila, Philippine Islands and Honolulu, Hawaii. Three ships were built at Barrow-in-Furness in England, and the three sailed together towards Vancouver in 1890, with initial voyages projected for January 15, February 15, and March 15 of the new year. An scale model of the ship was put on display in Canadian Pacific's New York offices. In an effort to lure American-Chinese passengers to sail with CPR from North America to Shanghai and Hong Kong, prominent members of the Chinese community in New York were invited to examine the scale model and its amenities. In 1915, CP changed the name of its shipping business to Canadian Pacific Steamships Ocean Services Ltd. In 1891, CPR and the British government reached agreement on a contract for subsidised mail service between Britain and Hong Kong via Canada. The route began to be serviced by three specially designed Empress liners—, and . Each of these \\"Empress\\" steamships sailed regularly in the period from 1891 through 1912. In that year, Empress of China struck a reef near Tokyo, and she was subsequently towed to Yokohama where she was scrapped. Empress of India would continue in service through 1914. RMS Empress of Japan sailed regularly from 1891 through 1922. These three ships and the others which comprised the \\"Empress fleet\\" carried mail, passengers, and freight speedily across the Pacific for over half a century.Postal History Society of Canada: trans-Pacific mail service and the \\"Empress fleet\\" In 1903, the company took over the ships and services of the Beaver Line and began operating ships on the Atlantic between Halifax, Nova Scotia and the United Kingdom. In 1906, two vessels were built in Scotland: and RMS Empress of Ireland. These two vessels had a full capacity of 1,530 passengers. There were accommodations for 310 first class, 470 second class passengers, 500 third class and 250 steerage passengers. The CP transported many immigrants from Europe to Canada, primarily from Great Britain and Scandinavia. CP acquired the successful Allan Line, and expanded to become a major international cargo carrier and operators of luxury passenger liners such as and . Sinking of Empress of Ireland RMS Empress of Ireland In 1914, Empress of Ireland sank after a collision with the Norwegian collier in the Saint Lawrence River. In just 14 minutes after the collision, this incident claimed 1,012 lives making it the deadliest maritime disaster in Canadian history.The Golden Age of Liners. BBC Four. Timeshift, Series 9, Episode 2. Empress of Ireland was heading down the channel near Pointe-au-Père, Quebec in heavy fog. At 02:00 Storstad crashed in the side of the CP liner. Storstad, though damaged, did not sink. Empress of Ireland took severe damage to her starboard side and began to list and take on water. Some passengers managed to get into lifeboats quickly. The ship began to list too far, and additional life rafts were not able to be launched. The ship rolled to its side ten minutes after the collision. Four minutes later the ship had sunk. Only 465 survivors were rescued. A board of inquiry found Storstad responsible for the sinking. =World War I (1914–1918)= aground in Canada before the war. Canadian Pacific was an important contributor to the Merchant Navy (United Kingdom) in World War I. Like other shipping companies, Canadian Pacific provided ships to carry troops in both World Wars. CP lost 18 ships in the war. In World War I, some ships were refitted as armed merchantmen or auxiliary minelayers. These were operated by the British Royal Navy, not CP Ships. For example, RMS Princess Irene and RMS Princess Margaret were requisitioned at the point of completion by the British Royal Navy for war service. They were manned by naval personnel, not CP. Neither ship was delivered to CP – Princess Irene exploded in 1915 and Princess Margaret was purchased by the Admiralty after the war. =Inter-war period (1919–1938)= CP purchased eleven new steamships to replace its losses during the war. New ships included , , (), () and . The company continued to carry passengers, freight and mail across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The company also built a fleet of \\"Beaver Ships\\", Cargo liners, for fast freight service in the 1920s which were some of the most advanced steam freighters of their time , Beaverdale, Beaverburn, Beaverhill and Beaverbrae.\\"SS Beaverford\\", Clydebuilt Canada’’ Royal visit to Canada In 1939, the CP Ship Empress of Australia transported King George VI and his royal consort, Queen Elizabeth from London, England to Quebec City for the 1939 royal tour of Canada. This was the first ever visit by the monarch to a dominion. The king chose to visit Canada using a Canadian luxury liner rather than an established English royal yacht. Empress of Australia was considered to be a royal yacht after her use by the king. =World War II (1939–1945)= at Montreal in 1933 In World War II, the CP fleet carried over a million tons of cargo and a million troops and civilians during World War II. One CP ship, the freighter SS Beaverford, made the most notable military action in the company's history in 1940 as part of Convoy HX 84 when she engaged the German for five hours before sinking with all hands, a sacrifice that allowed most of convoy HX 84 to escape. The company lost twelve vessels due to enemy action which is a larger loss than any Western company. Empress of Britain was the largest ship lost to enemy action during the Battle of the Atlantic. Losses also included all of its fleet of \\"Beaver ship\\" cargo liners. Company ships participated in both the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Pacific. Despite their extensive and dangerous war service, the CP mariners, part of the Merchant Navy, were denied veterans' benefits by the Canadian Government until 1988. =Post-war period (1945–2005)= Side elevation plans of Empress of Britain From 1956 to 1961, the company acquired its last three steam passenger ships , and . Competition from airlines forced CP to retire these ships in the 1970s. The company looked towards bulk carrier and tanker fleets as replacements for its steamships. In 1971, the company changed its name to CP Ships Ltd. Container ships added as Intermodal freight transport became popular. Intermodal transportation integrated well with CP's rail assets. In 1972, CP Ships regular transatlantic passenger service from the Port of Liverpool finished with the sale of Empress of Canada. In 1984, CP Ships entered a joint venture with Compagnie Maritime Belge called Canada Maritime to secure North Atlantic container traffic for its rail facilities at the Port of Montreal. This \\"new\\" company prospered and the fortunes of CP Ships revived in the early 1990s. In 1993 Canadian Pacific bought out its partner and merged it with CP Ships. The next decade saw the company grow through acquisition. In April 1995 CP Ships purchased the Cast Group out of a bankruptcy proceeding, and subsequently bought Lykes Lines in July 1997 also out of bankruptcy, Contship Containerlines in October 1997 at a profitable level, Australia-New Zealand Direct Line in December 1998 also being profitable, Ivaran Lines in May 1998 (unprofitable), TMM Lines (unprofitable, 50% in January 1999, rest 50% in January 2000), in August 2000 Christensen Canadian African Lines (CCAL) at small profitability and Italia Line in August 2002 at breakeven business results. By 2001 it was the seventh largest carrier in the world, and dominated the North Atlantic. When it was spun off into a separate company it represented 8% of Canadian Pacific's revenues and was a source for a large portion of CPR's rail traffic — much originating from CP Ships' Montreal Gateway Terminals. Sale  On August 21, 2005, German conglomerate TUI AG offered to acquire CP Ships Limited for €1.7 billion (US$2.0 billion) in cash, and merge it with TUI's Hapag-Lloyd division. On October 19, 2005, CP Ships and TUI AG jointly announced that 89.1% of CP Ships shareholders had accepted Ship Acquisition Inc.'s August 30 offer for US$21.50 per share on October 25, 2005. In 2011, the company name Canadian Pacific Steamships was abandoned. In 2012, the clothing company, Eyecon Enterprises Inc. (of Ontario, Canada) applied for, and was granted the Canadian Pacific Steamships trademark name along with the \\"three square\\" checkered flag graphic logo. In 2013, Canadian Pacific Steamships Limited was incorporated in Ontario, Canada and based out of Newmarket, Ontario. Their rights were abandoned in 2014 leaving trademark to CP Steamships available for use.https://trademark.trademarkia.com/canadian-pacific- steamships-85970011.html CP Ships archives were held by CP Limited until 2012 when it was donated to the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology.https://ingeniumcanada.org/channel/articles/uncovering-family- history-aboard-a-canadian-pacific-steamship Fleet eventsCivilian= There are several notable civilian events in the CP fleet. * In 1912 struck a reef near Tokyo and was towed to Yokohama and scrapped.

History  The White Guard first appeared in serial form in the Soviet-era literary journal Rossiya in 1925, but the magazine was closed down before the serial was completed. It was not reprinted in Russia until 1966. = The Days of the Turbins = After the first two parts of The White Guard were published in Rossiya, Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play The Days of the Turbins. This was produced at the Moscow Art Theatre, to great acclaim: :\\"The Day of the Turbins... became a theater legend... The production ran from 1926 to 1941, it had 987 performances... Stalin... saw it no fewer than 20 times\\".Dobrenko, Evgeny: Introduction to Bulgakov, Mikhail 2008. White Guard. transl. Marian Schwartz, Yale University Press, p. xix. In fact, the play completely overshadowed the book, which was in any event virtually unobtainable in any form. Since Bulgakov was refused permission to publish his most important works, he pleaded with Stalin to be allowed to leave the country. Stalin personally arranged for a job for him at the Moscow Arts Theatre.  Novel  His widow had The White Guard published in large part in the literary journal Moskva in 1966, at the end of the Khrushchev era. This was the basis for the English translation by Michael Glenny, first published in 1971. This lacks the dream flashback sections. In 2008 Yale University Press published a translation by Marian Schwartz of the complete novel, an edition which won an award. Set in Ukraine, beginning in late 1918, the novel concerns the fate of the Turbin family as the various armies of the Ukrainian War of Independence the Whites, the Reds, the Imperial German Army, and Ukrainian nationalists fight over the city of Kyiv. Historical figures such as Pyotr Wrangel, Symon Petliura and Pavlo Skoropadsky appear as the Turbin family is caught up in the turbulent effects of the October Revolution. The novel's characters belong to the sphere of Ukrainian and Russian intellectuals and officers. In the army of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi they participate in the defense of Kyiv from the forces of Ukrainian Nationalists (led by Petliura) in December 1918. The character Mikhail Shpolyansky is modelled on Viktor Shklovsky. = Editions in English = * The White Guard, translated by Michael Glenny. **London: Collins and Harvill Press, 1971. . **New York: McGraw-Hill, 1971.

Emprise has 34 locations across the state of Kansas, including branches in Wichita, Andover, Augusta, Chanute, Clearwater, Council Grove, Derby, El Dorado, Eureka, Goddard, Hays, Haysville, Hillsboro, Humboldt, Iola, Lawrence, McPherson, Moran, Park City, Potwin and Valley Center. History The history of Emprise Bank began in 1910 with the formation of Stockyards National Bank in Wichita, Kansas. In 1965, W.A. Michaelis, Jr. purchased Sierra Petroleum Co. Inc., which owned Stockyards National Bank. In the early 1970s, Stockyards Bank was renamed United American Bank & Trust Company to reflect the bank’s expansion into other parts of the city. Sierra later became Emprise Financial Corporation. Over the next 25 years, the Michaelis family acquired banks in communities across the state including Council Grove, Eureka, Hays, Hillsboro, Iola, Moran, Toronto, and Potwin. During this period, the Michaelis Family also acquired the National Bank of Wichita and Wichita State Bank. In 1989, the banks located in Wichita were merged and the combined institution was named Emprise Bank. The Michaelis family’s banks throughout the state were aligned geographically and merged to form four community bank charters. These banks were renamed Emprise Bank. In the early 1990s, Emprise expanded into Lawrence and added branch locations in the Wichita area. Emprise Bank then acquired Wichita Federal Savings & Loan in the mid 1990s, which increased the bank’s market share and doubled its asset size. In 2002, Emprise opened a location in El Dorado, and in 2003 locations were acquired in Humboldt and Chanute. Over the next two years, the community banks were all merged under one Emprise Bank charter. Then, in November 2006, Emprise Bank merged with Prairie State Bank, adding eleven additional branches to the Emprise network and increasing the number of employees to nearly 500. Through the merger, Emprise Bank reached $1 billion in total assets. The Art of Emprise The Art of Emprise is a collection of art owned by the bank. The collection showcases pieces from Kansas artists and now includes works from more than 530 artists. Many of these pieces come from students and faculty at colleges and universities across the state. In 1980, the Kansas Watercolor Society asked the Emprise Bank to sponsor its annual show; the bank agreed, and began making patron purchases on behalf of the banks. They have continued this sponsorship since, and expanded the Art of Emprise collection well beyond watercolors. Originally, the focus was simply finding unique pieces of art, but that focus changed to include artists with a Kansas connection. The art is available to be viewed at Emprise Bank locations, as well as some other locations. Works of the collection have been displayed at the Andover Library (Andover, Kan.), Beach Museum (Manhattan, Kan.), Coutts Art Museum (El Dorado, Kan.), Lawrence Arts Center, Ulrich Museum, and the Wichita Art Museum. The collection has also been shared with the U.S. Art in Embassies Program, having works displayed in Belize and Uzbekistan. Controversy The bank received media attention in September 2017 after having an Iraqi-American family arrested. Sattar Ali, a doctoral student who had lived in the United States since 1993, tried to deposit a check for $151,000 at Emprise. This sum had been obtained from the sale of their old home in Michigan. With insufficient verification documents, Ali was handcuffed and had his belongings confiscated after the bank called the police. 4 police cars arrived to arrest Ali at around 11.30am. Police also arrested Ali's wife and 15-year-old daughter, who had been waiting for him in the car outside. Police also called the school of Ali's 11-year-old son to have him detained there while the rest of his family was in custody. Wichita police were able to confirm that the check was legitimate, 48 minutes after the arrest, and released the family around 3.00pm. “We were devastated. Terrified. Crying the whole time,” Ali said. “We had no idea what the arrest was for.” Emprise claimed that the police were called as the bank had trouble verifying the check. Emprise Bank released a statement regarding this incident indicating that they saw nothing wrong with the bank branch's action: > \\".. We are aware of a situation at the 21st and Woodlawn branch yesterday > and can confirm that our team acted in accordance with our policies and > procedures. If faced with the same circumstances today, we would expect our > team to take the same actions.\\" Ali said in an interview that this had been an example of racial profiling, and questioned why his family had also been arrested: “Let’s assume I made a mistake and gave them a bad check,” Ali said. “Why would they arrest my wife and daughter?” Ali stated that he had plans to take legal action against the bank for the incident. The bank subsequently issued an apology: \\"Bank Chairman Matthew Michealis says the bank is sorry for the incident that occurred on Sept. 6 when a teller called 911 after saying Sattar Ali was trying to deposit a fraudulent $150,000 check. In his statement, Michaelis says the bank will \\"conduct a complete review of the incident\\" with all parties involved. He says Emprise Bank staff will now participate in sensitivity training. \\"At Emprise, we believe that what we do and say is a reflection of who we are. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind,\\" said Michaelis in the statement.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Locations * Leadership Category:Banks based in Kansas Category:Banks established in 1910 ","title":"Emprise Bank"},{"id":"2493181","text":"In cryptography, the Full Domain Hash (FDH) is an RSA-based signature scheme that follows the hash-and-sign paradigm. It is provably secure (i.e., is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen-message attacks) in the random oracle model. FDH involves hashing a message using a function whose image size equals the size of the RSA modulus, and then raising the result to the secret RSA exponent. Exact security of full domain hash In the random oracle model, if RSA is (t', \\\\epsilon')-secure, then the full domain hash RSA signature scheme is (t, \\\\epsilon)-secure where, :\\\\begin{align} t &= t' - (q_\\\\text{hash} + q_\\\\text{sig} + 1) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(k^3\\\\right)  \\\\epsilon &= \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{q_\\\\text{sig}}\\\\right)^{q_\\\\text{sig} + 1} \\\\cdot q_\\\\text{sig} \\\\cdot \\\\epsilon' \\\\end{align}.

Marsilius; 10 July 1658 – 1 November 1730) was an Italian scholar and eminent natural scientist, who also served as an emissary and soldier.  Biography  Transylvania (today Romania) published in Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus, vol. 2 (1726) Born in Bologna, he was a member of an ancient patrician family and was educated in accordance with his noble social rank. He supplemented his reading by studying mathematics, anatomy, and natural history helped by the best Bolognese tutors and enhanced by his personal observations. After a course of scientific studies in his native city he travelled throughout Asia Minor collecting data on the Ottoman Empire's military organisation, as well as on its natural history. On his return he entered the service of the Emperor Leopold (1682) and fought with distinction against the Turks, by whom he was wounded and captured in an action on the River Rába; sold to a pasha who met him after the Battle of Vienna, his release was secured in 1684. He returned to the Imperial Army deploying his skills as a talented military engineer. Marsigli contributed to the successful siege of Buda in 1686 and in the following years in the military operations of the liberation war against the Turks. After the Treaty of Karlowitz he was commissioned to lead the Habsburg border demarcation commission. Marsigli mapped the 850 km-long Habsburg- Ottoman border in the former Kingdom of Hungary (today including Croatia, Serbia, Romania). During the twenty years he spent in Hungary he collected scientific information, specimens, antiques, took measurements and observations for his work on the Danube. He was assisted by Dr Johann Christoph Müller who prepared manuscripts for printing and commissioned the engravers in his home town of Nuremberg. The sample of the work, Prodromus, was published in 1700 and the large work was expected by 1704. His scholarship was well received in England, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1691. Drawing of a grey heron, after Raimondo Manzini, published in Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus, vol. 5. During the War of the Spanish Succession Marsigli was second-in-command under the Count d'Arco at the Imperial fortress of Breisach on the Rhine, which was surrendered in 1703. Count d'Arco was beheaded because he was found guilty of capitulating before necessary, while Marsigli was stripped of his titles and honours by the Holy Roman Emperor, and his chivalric sword was broken over him. His appeals to the Emperor were in vain, but public opinion, however, acquitted him later of the charge of neglect or ignorance. After he had left the Habsburg Army he made journeys to Switzerland and then France, spending a considerable time at Marseilles undertaking studies about the nature of the sea. He drew plans, made astronomical observations, measured the speed and size of rivers, studied the products, the mines, the birds, fishes, and fossils of every land he visited, and also collected specimens of every kind, instruments, models, antiquities, etc. Finally he returned to Bologna and presented his entire collection to the Senate of Bologna University in 1712. There he founded his \\"Institute of Sciences and Arts\\", which was formally opened in 1715. Six professors were put in charge of the different divisions of the Institute. Later he established a printing-house furnished with the best type sets for Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. This was put in charge of the Dominicans under the patronage of St. Thomas Aquinas. His major work on the Danube was published, after twenty years of delay, in 1726 in Amsterdam and The Hague. The maps of the work were published as an atlas in 1744. His treatise of oceans, published in 1725, renders Marsigli to be considered the founding father of modern oceanography.Sartori, Renzo. “Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, Founding Father of Oceanography.” In Four Centuries of the Word Geology. Ulisse Aldrovandi 1603 in Bologna, edited by Gian Battista Vai and William Cavazza. Bologna, Italy: Minerva Edizioni, 2003. In 1727 he added to his other collections East India material which he collected in England and Holland. A formal procession of the Institute he founded was established to take place every twenty-five years on the Feast of the Annunciation. In 1715 he was named a Foreign Associate of the Paris Academy of Sciences; he was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of London,royalsocietypublishing.org and of Montpellier.  Works  A list of his works, over twenty in number, is given in Niceron's Mémoirs. His principal works are the following: Osservazioni interne al Bosforo Tracio (Rome, 1681); Histoire physique de la mer, translated by Leclerc (Amsterdam, 1725); Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus, richly illustrated work in six volumes containing much valuable historic and scientific information on the river Danubius, (6 vols., The Hague, 1726); and L'Etat militaire de l'empire ottoman (Amsterdam, 1732).

Tsiyonut ruchanit) is a strain of the concept of Zionism that values creating a Jewish state with its own secular Jewish culture and history, including language and historical roots, rather than other Zionist ideas such as political Zionism. The man considered to have founded the concept of cultural Zionism is Asher Ginsberg, better known as Ahad Ha'am. With his secular vision of a Jewish \\"spiritual center\\" in Israel, he confronted Theodor Herzl. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ha'am strived for \\"a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews\\".Ahad Ha'am, The Jewish State and Jewish Problem, trans. from the Hebrew by Leon Simon c 1912, Jewish Publication Society of America, Essential Texts of Zionism History Originally, Ahad Ha'am saw problems in Judaism and sought out ways to revitalize the religious community and the religion itself to regenerate interest in Judaism's adherents, especially its youth. He saw nationalism as a way to reconnect Jews to Judaism, putting forth ideas of creating settlements in Eretz Yisrael (Palestine) filled with well-versed Hebrew-speakers and a core adherence to Judaism. He saw the land of Israel and the Hebrew language as integral parts of the Jewish national heritage, and not necessarily of religious significance. He viewed Theodor Herzl, an Austrian-Jewish journalist who was a proponent of political Zionism, as naive to suggest creating a Jewish state in any other area of the world. Neither did Ahad Ha'am trust other countries to help realize the Zionist goal of creating a Jewish state in Palestine, nor anywhere else for that matter. Ahad HaAm emphasized \\"Jewish self-reliance\\" over any other precept, as well as careful planning in infrastructure and construction of a Jewish footing in the Holy Land. Ahad Ha'am recognized that the effort to achieve independence in the land of Israel would bring Jews into conflict with the native Arab population, as well as with the Ottomans and European colonial powers then eying the country. Instead, he proposed that the emphasis of the Zionist movement shift to efforts to revive the Hebrew language and create a new culture, free from negative diaspora influences, that would unite Jews and serve as a common denominator between diverse Jewish communities. The main goal of Ahad Ha'am's cultural Zionism was the establishment of a new spiritual center for the Jewish nation, which did not necessarily require the establishment of a Jewish state, but did require the establishment of a Jewish majority in its national home.N. Finkelstein, 2002, 'Image and reality of the Israel-Palestine conflict', 2nd ed., p. 7-12 The idea took hold in adherents to the school of political Zionism and became a main focus of the World Zionist Organization following its sixth congress in 1903. Following Herzl's death, Ahad Ha'am became the main leader of the WZO along with Chaim Weizmann, who energized the Zionist movement with ideas for a regeneration of the Hebrew language, establishment of Jewish settlements in Palestine, and resurrecting nationalism with Jews in the Jewish Diaspora. The most prominent follower of this idea was Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a linguist intent on reviving Hebrew as a spoken language among Jews (see History of the Hebrew language). Most European Jews in the 19th century spoke Yiddish, a language based on mediaeval German, but as of the 1880s, Ben Yehuda and his supporters began promoting the use and teaching of a modernised form of biblical Hebrew, which had not been a living language for nearly 2,000 years. Despite Herzl's efforts to have German proclaimed the official language of the Zionist movement, the use of Hebrew was adopted as official policy by Zionist organisations in Palestine, and served as an important unifying force among the Jewish settlers, many of whom also took new Hebrew names. Other cultural Zionists attempted to create new Jewish art forms, including graphic arts. (Boris Schatz, a Bulgarian artist, founded the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem in 1906.) Others, such as dancer and artist Baruch Agadati, fostered popular festivals such as the Adloyada carnival on Purim.

Aluminium tribromide is the most common form of aluminium bromide. It is a colorless, sublimable hygroscopic solid; hence old samples tend to be hydrated, mostly as aluminium tribromide hexahydrate (AlBr3·6H2O). Structure The dimeric form of aluminium tribromide (Al2Br6) predominates in the solid state, in solutions in noncoordinating solvents (e.g. CS2), in the melt, and in the gas phase. Only at high temperatures do these dimers break up into monomers: : Al2Br6 → 2 AlBr3 ΔH°diss = 59 kJ/mol The species aluminium monobromide forms from the reaction of HBr with Al metal at high temperature. It disproportionates near room temperature: :6/n \\"[AlBr]n\\" → Al2Br6 \\\\+ 4 Al This reaction is reversed at temperatures higher than 1000 °C. Aluminium monobromide has been crystallographically characterized in the form the tetrameric adduct Al4Br4(NEt3)4 (Et = C2H5). This species is electronically related to cyclobutane. Theory suggest that the diatomic aluminium monobromide condenses to a dimer and then a tetrahedral cluster Al4Br4, akin to the analogous boron compound. Al2Br6 consists of two AlBr4 tetrahedra that share a common edge. The molecular symmetry is D2h. The monomer AlBr3, observed only in the vapor, can be described as trigonal planar, D3h point group. The atomic hybridization of aluminium is often described as sp2. The Br-Al-Br bond angles are 120 °. Synthesis Experiment showing synthesis of aluminum bromide from the elements. By far the most common form of aluminium bromide is Al2Br6. This species exists as hygroscopic colorless solid at standard conditions. Typical impure samples are yellowish or even red-brown due to the presence of iron-containing impurities. It is prepared by the reaction of HBr with Al: :2 Al + 6 HBr → Al2Br6 \\\\+ 3 H2 Alternatively, the direct bromination occurs also: :2 Al + 3 Br2 → Al2Br6 Reactions A demonstration of the reaction of the exothermic reaction of the strong Lewis acid (Al2Br6) and strong Lewis base (H2O). Al2Br6 dissociates readily to give the strong Lewis acid, AlBr3. Regarding the tendency of Al2Br6 to dimerize, it is common for heavier main group halides to exist as aggregates larger than implied by their empirical formulae. Lighter main group halides such as boron tribromide do not show this tendency, in part due to the smaller size of the central atom. Consistent with its Lewis acidic character, water hydrolizes Al2Br6 with evolution of HBr and formation of Al-OH-Br species. Similarly, it also reacts quickly with alcohols and carboxylic acids, although less vigorously than with water. With simple Lewis bases (L), Al2Br6 forms adducts, such as AlBr3L. Aluminium tribromide reacts with carbon tetrachloride at 100 °C to form carbon tetrabromide: : 4 AlBr3 \\\\+ 3 CCl4 → 4 AlCl3 \\\\+ 3 CBr4 and with phosgene yields carbonyl bromide and aluminium chlorobromide: : AlBr3 \\\\+ COCl2 → COBr2 \\\\+ AlCl2Br Al2Br6 is used as a catalyst for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction. Related Lewis acid- promoted reactions include as epoxide ring openings and decomplexation of dienes from iron carbonyls. It is a stronger Lewis acid than the more common Al2Cl6. Safety Aluminium tribromide is a highly reactive material.

It was filmed and first screened in 1996 and released along with select prints of the film Thinner. It was released as promo a year later internationally on LaserDisc, VHS and Video CD. Jackson plays five roles. The film tells the story of an eccentric man with supernatural powers being forced out of a small town by its mayor. The film includes a series of dance routines performed by Jackson and his \\"family\\" of ghouls. The songs are taken from Jackson's albums HIStory (1995) and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997). Plot The Mayor of Normal Valley leads a mob to the mansion of the Maestro, who has been entertaining local children with magic tricks and ghost stories. The children assure the parents the Maestro has done nothing wrong, but the Mayor intends to banish him as a \\"freak\\". The Maestro challenges the Mayor to a \\"scaring contest\\": the first to become scared must leave. He performs magic tricks and dance routines with a ghostly horde, and finally possesses the Mayor, forcing him to dance. After the performance ends, the Maestro agrees to leave and crumbles to dust, but returns as an enormous demon. Terrified, the Mayor leaps through the window. The families agree that they had fun and allow the Maestro to stay. Production The project began production in 1993 under the title Is it Scary? with director Mick Garris, planned for release in conjunction with the family comedy film Addams Family Values. Following contract disputes, the Addams Family connection was dropped. Stan Winston, who was previously in charge of makeup and visual effects, took over as director when Garris left to make the Shining miniseries. According to Garris, Ghosts was \\"the most expensive music video ever made\\" at around $15 million dollars, all paid for by Jackson.

At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by Pharrell Williams' \\"Happy\\".  Reception  According to AV Club writer Nathan Rabin, Ghosts is a \\"staggeringly blunt\\" allegory for Jackson's life and pop culture status. Rabin attributed its failure to Jackson's place in the public imagination at the time, in light of Jackson's recent divorce from Lisa Marie Presley and the 1993 child molestation allegations against him. Deluxe collector box set In December 1997, towards the end of promotion for Michael Jackson's remix album Blood on the Dance Floor, a Deluxe Collector Box Set of Ghosts was released only in Europe. The box set included a VHS release of Jackson's Ghosts mini-movie on home video and his Blood on the Dance Floor album on CD, as well as a CD maxi single named the Limited Edition Minimax CD. \\"On the Line\\" was the first track on this single. =\\"On the Line\\"= \\"On the Line\\" is a song co-written and produced by Babyface.

In addition to working for multiple independent promotions, Mayo appeared with WWE in early 2005 on SmackDown! as part of a vignette featuring Luther Reigns. She regularly appears with the Orlando-based promotion TNA Wrestling, working variously as a ring girl and merchandise model beginning in June 2005.

At No Surrender, Val turned heel by giving Lethal a low blow, allowing Dutt to get the victory. In the following weeks, Val's actions were explained by transitioning her character into a gold digger, claiming that Dutt's father was the richest man in India. In 2009, Dutt was released thus ending the storyline. She returned to her previous role as a ring girl on the April 2, 2009 edition of Impact!.

Plot A serial killer named Karl Hochman (Ted Marcoux) is known as \\"The Address Book Killer\\" due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into a computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl collides into a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve into a cemetery as he laughs. In the emergency room he is put into an MRI machine. A surge from an electrical storm manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the electrical grid and computer networks. Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill everyone listed on the page. Her boss, Frank Mallory (Richard McKenzie), becomes the first victim when his microwave oven explodes. Another friend, Elliot Kastner (Jack Laufer), gets burned to death when a hand dryer turns into a flamethrower. Terry hires a babysitter, Carol Maibaum (Shevonne Durkin), to look after her son Josh (Wil Horneff). However, Carol becomes the third victim; she is electrocuted by an exploding dishwasher in the kitchen. The police do not believe the theory that Karl is on a killing spree after his death, but Josh realizes the order of the killings is related to a list of contacts from Terry's address book. Terry, along with computer hacker Bram Walker (Chris Mulkey), unplugs everything in her house. The police then receive anonymous reports of an armed robbery, a hostage situation, domestic violence, and a murder in progress, all at Terry's house. The police open fire on the home after mistaking an exploding generator for gunfire. When they realize their mistake, they cease fire. Terry's mother goes into shock during the siege and is transported to the hospital for recovery. Aided by Bram and Terry, Josh manages to defeat Karl by introducing a computer virus that traps him in a physics laboratory. They activate an atom smasher located in the lab, which draws Karl in and destroys him. As the film ends, Bram tells Terry to turn off a heart rate monitor in an ambulance, causing the screen to fade to black.

Later on, David Hesse joined as a guitarist, and Ben Shillabeer as a drummer. The band's first album, Patiently Waiting, was released in 2001. After the release of the album, the band decided to change its name upon finding a popular band under the same name overseas, and so they came up with the new name Social Code. =Signing to Interscope Records and major label releases (2003-2008)= The band then landed a record deal with Interscope at the end of 2003, where they released their major label debut, A Year at the Movies In May 2004.

In 2007 the St. Albert foursome took on the task of creating a new record on their own. Social Code's previous experience working with high-profile producers, such as Howard Benson (The All-American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance) in Los Angeles gave the band the experience and confidence to go it alone. They gutted the basement of Jacobs' house, built a studio and spent the next year working on their second album called Social-Code that was released in May 2007, in Canada. The album was successful in Canada, and spawned the successful singles \\"Bomb Hands\\", \\"The Shortest Line\\", \\"Everyday (Late November)\\" and \\"He Said, She Said\\".

The services provided by Telesur include telephone, internet and wireless CDMA, GSM, UMTS, HSPA+ and LTE. Telesur is currently running a 900/1800 Mhz GSM, a 2100 MHz HSDPA, and a 450Mhz CDMA EVDO network. Telesur manages and operates the .sr country code top-level domain. History Telesur was founded on May 1, 1945, under the name ’s Lands Telegraaf Telefoondienst (“National Telegraph Telephone Service”), LTT, and was formed from the merger of the ’s Lands Radiodienst (“National Radio Service”), (established in 1925) and the ’s Lands Telefoonwezen, (“National Telephone Entity”), (founded in 1907). Twenty-eight years later, the company's name was changed to ’s Lands Telegraaf Telefoonbedrijf (National Telegraph and Telephone Company). In 1981 the name was officially changed to Telesur. Twenty-six years later, Telesur lost its monopoly position by the introduction of the Telecommunications Services Law in Suriname. In 2008, Telesur expanded its operations to the Netherlands. TeleG Logo TeleG TeleG is the mobile telecommunication service of the Telecommunications Company Suriname, Telesur. It was released in 2002 to provide in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology. 3G Launch TeleG 3G logo In October 2011, TeleG launched their 3G network. However, in 2012 some of its users faced a bad internet connection or were not able to make or receive a phone call. Later that year they Re- launched their 3G network and a better service was acquired. The service was only available in the capital, Paramaribo, and several parts of Nickerie (district), Commewijne (district), Wanica (district), Para (district) and Marowijne (district). 4G Launch TeleG 4G logo On November 15, 2013 TeleG released their 4G network. Telesur was already working on the transition from 3G to 4G. The investment had cost a total of 10 million U$. The 4G coverage would only be available for 56 locations in Paramaribo and Commewijne that year. In the beginning of 2014 Telesur expanded their 4G coverage. At the end of 2014 Telesur reached their set goal; to have total coverage of 4G in all parts of Suriname. The average user of TeleG would experience a download speed of 10MBPS. Next to Telesur, the European-Based network Digicel, has launched their 4G network. The launch took place in July 2014. Internet To deliver internet services Telesur used to do that under the trademark name Tele.i. The \\"i\\" in Tele.i. stands for Internet, therefore Tele.i. means Telesur internet. Currently Telesur no longer delivers internet services under that name, but just under the Telesur internet trademark name. The internet services that are provided by Telesur are broadband internet, dedicated internet, streaming, web hosting, internet calling, domainname registration.

Red vestments are prescribed for Palm Sunday in the Code of Rubrics, 126. A Latin Mass is a Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in Ecclesiastical Latin.  Tridentine Mass in Latin  The term \\"Latin Mass\\" is frequently used to denote the Tridentine Mass, that is, the Roman Rite liturgy of the Mass celebrated in Latin and in accordance with the successive editions of the Roman Missal published between 1570 and 1962. In most countries, the Tridentine Mass was celebrated only in Latin. However, there are exceptions. In early seventeenth century China, Jesuit missionaries secured permission from Pope Paul V to celebrate the Catholic Mass in Chinese, part of an effort to adapt their work to Chinese cultural norms and conditions. In Dalmatia and parts of Istria, the liturgy was celebrated in Church Slavonic, and authorization for use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935. There, \\"Tridentine Mass\\" was not synonymous with \\"Latin Mass\\". A further distancing between the concepts of \\"Tridentine Mass\\" and \\"Latin Mass\\" was brought about by the 1964 Instruction on implementing the Constitution on Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, which laid down that \\"normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular\\". Episcopal conferences were to decide, with the consent of the Holy See, what other parts, if any, of the Mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular. Permissions were thus granted from 1967 onwards to celebrate most of the Tridentine Mass in vernacular languages, including the Canon.  Roman Rite Mass in Latin  Neither the Second Vatican Council nor the subsequent revision of the Roman Missal abolished Latin as the liturgical language of the Roman Rite: the official text of the Roman Missal, on which translations into vernacular languages are to be based, continues to be in Latin, and Latin can still be used in the celebration.. The term \\"Latin Mass\\" is sometimes applied to such celebrations, which in some places are part of the normal Sunday schedule.  Other forms of Mass in Latin  Historically speaking, \\"Latin Mass\\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre- Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.. Latin liturgical rites other than the Roman Rite have used Latin, and in some cases continue to do so. These include the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite. Some priests and communities continue to use non-Roman-Rite liturgies that have been generally abandoned, such as the Carmelite Rite and the Dominican Rite, celebrating them in Latin. Celebration in Latin of such rites is sometimes referred to as \\"Latin Mass\\"..  Other uses  A Traditionalist Catholic periodical in the United States is entitled The Latin Mass, the Journal of Catholic Culture and Tradition. Various editions of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer have been translated into Latin: for example, for use in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (Liber Precum Publicarum of Walther Haddon, 1560). The Church of the Advent of Christ the King, an Anglo-Catholic parish in San Francisco, regularly celebrates Mass according to the 1979 Prayer Book of its province, the Episcopal Church, in Latin.

Hussein served as the longstanding Minister of National Defense of The Republic of Sudan. Hussein also served for a period as the Minister of Interior Affairs. During his term as Minister of Interior Affairs, he opened the Rabat University. In later years, he was accused of supporting the Janjaweed and committing war crimes, allegations he and the government both strongly deny. Hussein was arrested in early April 2019 following a coup on 11 April which overthrew al-Bashir.Sudan's Omar al-Bashir forced out in coup, CNN, Eliza Mackintosh and James Griffiths, 11 April 2019 Early life Hussein was born in 1949 Dongola, part of Northern State, although other sources have placed his birth in or around Dankla in Karma city in Khartoum North. In 1964 he began his secondary education in Khartoum. It was here that he became an Islamist and also where he met and became close friends with Omar al-Bashir. Military career He joined the Sudanese Air Force in the 1960s, and became a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhoods military cell from the 1970s onwards. Hussein graduated from the prestigious Cranfield University in the United Kingdom with a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1982. He played a major role in the 1989 Sudanese coup d'état, and afterwards became Secretary-General of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation; the ruling authority of Sudan between 1989 and 1993. PoliticsInterior Minister= Following the dissolution of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation he was appointed Minister of Interior Affairs by President Bashir, a position through which he dominated Sudan's internal security services. Whilst Interior Minister he was alleged to have worked directly with al-Qaeda during Osama bin Ladens time in Sudan from 1992 to 1996, and was alleged to have even provided al-Qaeda with sophisticated communications equipment. Despite being a strong Islamist, Hussein remained a loyal Bashir supporter following Bashir's rift with Hassan al-Turabi; the leader of the National Islamic Front, and quite possibly the most influential Sudanese Islamist, who had supported Bashir in his 1989 coup attempt. Hussein has recognised the major role Turabi played in the formation of the ideology that led the 1989 coup attempt, and spoke in 2002 about how although disliked the rift with Turabi due to the intellectual and political debt they owed him, Turabi's imprisonment was in fact necessary to protect the state that Turabi had advocated for. In 2003 President Bashir appointed Hussein as his special representative for Darfur. He held this position until 2004. He lost his job as Interior Minister in 2005 after the National Assembly demanded his resignation following a scandal caused by the collapse of a police hospital he owned. =Minister of Defence= He became the Minister of National Defense in 2005, although has faced problems in this position, such as in May 2008 when he faced calls for his resignation due to security failures resulting in the 2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum. He has also faced problems as Defence Minister from senior army officers demanding greater independence for the Sudanese Armed Forces from the National Congress Party. He has also been unsympathetic to rapprochement with the West, and even consoled the family of one of the killers of the US Diplomat John Granville following the death of the young militant in Somalia. War crimes allegations On 2 December 2011, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of the investigating the situation in Darfur, Luis Moreno Ocampo, requested a Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court to issue an arrest warrant against Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein for war crimes and crimes against humanity.ICC Prosecutor Presents New Case in Darfur . ICC press release. 2 December 2011. Retrieved 2 December 2011. On March 1, 2012, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Hussein, charging with 20 counts of crimes against humanity and 21 counts of war crimes. As one of Bashir's closest allies, Hussein is accused of recruiting, arming and funding police forces and the Janjaweed militia in Darfur and also reported to be leading a campaign against rebels in the south. 2019 arrest On 11 April 2019, al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup and Hussein was soon afterwards arrested. On 27 May 2020, Sudan’s public prosecution service announced that Hussein had tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently placed in quarantine.

He also worked at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and taught English in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. During his time in Nicaragua, his political philosophy was shaped by reading A Theory of Justice by liberal philosopher John Rawls. Romanoff obtained a Master's degree in public policy from John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Prior to earning a J.D. degree from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, Romanoff worked for Democratic Congressman David Skaggs. Career From 1993 to 1997, Romanoff worked as a senior associate at the consulting firm of Greenberg Baron Simon & Miller. Romanoff served as a senior policy advisor to Governor Roy Romer from 1997 to 1999. Romanoff has taught government at the University of Colorado Denver (1999), the Community College of Denver (1996–2005), Metropolitan State College of Denver (1996-2005), and Red Rocks Community College (1996–2005). Romanoff has been a senior advisor with International Development Enterprises since 2010.Michael Booth, Romanoff to fight world poverty as senior adviser to Lakewood nonprofit, October 6, 2010, The Denver Post =Colorado House of Representatives= Romanoff was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 2000 to 2008, winning reelection three times. He became Speaker of the House in 2005, and at the time was the youngest speaker in Colorado House history. Before becoming speaker he was the House Minority Leader, representing House District 6. Many considered Romanoff a possible Democratic candidate for governor of Colorado in 2006, but he announced in late 2005 that he would not run. He left the Colorado House after 2008 due to term limits. In 2010, members of the Colorado Latino Forum criticized Romanoff in a Denver Post op-ed for his support of legislation affecting immigrants, including one law that “denied basic government services to individuals who couldn’t immediately prove they were legal residents.” =2010 U.S. Senate election= In early 2009, U.S. Senator Ken Salazar was nominated and confirmed as United States Secretary of the Interior. Romanoff was on a short list of possible candidates for appointment to Salazar's seat, but Governor Bill Ritter chose Denver schools' superintendent Michael Bennet. Romanoff opted to challenge Bennet for the Senate seat in the Democratic primary. The Washington Post' reported, \\"Many Democrats here and in Washington think Romanoff decided to challenge Bennet purely out of pique, resentful that Gov. Bill Ritter (D) did not appoint him to the Senate seat left vacant when Obama named former senator Ken Salazar interior secretary.\\" Romanoff made campaign finance and ethics a key issue of his campaign, declining to take Political Action Committee (PAC) money for his Senate campaign. He had taken PAC money as a member of the Colorado legislature. A preference poll taken March 16 at precinct caucuses showed Romanoff with 51 percent support, Bennet with 42 percent, and the remaining uncommitted. Delegates at each stage of the Democratic caucus-assembly process are not pledged to a candidate but are selected based on candidate preference. Romanoff defeated Bennet in the Democratic State Assembly, with 60.4% of the vote to Bennet's 39.6%, thereby earning the first spot on the August primary ballot. On September 16, 2009, Romanoff officially announced his campaign to challenge Bennet for the 2010 Democratic Senate nomination. Bill Clinton endorsed him on June 29, 2010. President Barack Obama endorsed Bennet shortly after Romanoff announced his candidacy. On August 10, 2010, Romanoff was defeated by Bennet in the Democratic primary. Job offer from the Obama administration On September 27, 2009, Michael Riley of the Denver Post reported that Romanoff had been offered a position in the Obama administration in exchange for not running for U.S. Senate against Michael Bennet.Riley, Michael. D.C. job alleged as attempt to deter Romanoff, Denver Post, September 27, 2009. According to Riley, Obama's deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina called Romanoff to offer him various positions in the administration, including a position at the United States Agency for International Development. Romanoff turned down the offer.Littwin, Mike. Littwin: Romanoff won't answer why he won't answer, Denver Post, May 30, 2010. On June 2, 2010, Romanoff issued a statement confirming that Messina had contacted him on September 11, 2009, and told him that Obama was going to support Bennet in the Democratic Party primary. Romanoff told Messina that he would run anyway; Messina \\"suggested three positions that might be available to me were I not pursuing the Senate race. He added that he could not guarantee my appointment to any of these positions.\\" White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton told The Washington Post, \\"Mr. Romanoff was recommended to the White House from Democrats in Colorado for a position in the administration. There were some initial conversations with him, but no job was ever offered.\\" Messina sent Romanoff job descriptions for three positions: an administrator for the Latin America and Caribbean Bureau within USAID, the chief of the Office of Democracy and Governance within USAID, and the director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.Elliott, Philip. Senate candidate says White House discussed 3 jobs, The Washington Post, June 3, 2010. On June 10, 2010, KDVR reported that Bennet said he had known about the White House's offer to Romanoff. = 2014 U.S. House election= Romanoff ran for the United States House of Representatives from Colorado's 6th congressional district in 2014. He lost to incumbent Republican Mike Coffman, 42.99% to 51.90%. Romanoff had relocated to Aurora, Colorado, in the 6th district, in 2013 to establish residency for his 2014 campaign. The district became significantly more hospitable to Democratic candidates after 2011, when it was redrawn to include nearly as many Democratic and unaffiliated voters as Republican voters. In May 2014 Howard Dean endorsed Romanoff and spoke at one of his campaign fundraising events. Despite committing to reject contributions from political action committees and special interest groups, the Colorado Observer reported in August 2013 that Romanoff had received a plurality of his second-quarter fundraising from the legal industry. On October 8, 2014, the Aurora Sentinel endorsed Romanoff. On October 10, Politico reported that national Democrats were canceling more than a $1 million in campaign ads in support of Romanoff, \\"a sign of waning confidence in his prospects.\\" = 2020 U.S. Senate election= On February 7, 2019, Romanoff announced his candidacy to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Cory Gardner in the 2020 election. He won the statewide caucuses with 86% of the vote and was defeated by former Governor John Hickenlooper in the Democratic primary. =Political positions= A political progressive, Romanoff has advocated for a Green New Deal and Medicare For All. Romanoff has stated his support for the Affordable Care Act. He has declined to give his position on the Keystone Pipeline until a delayed State Department review is complete.

It developed in the Latin language in the city of Rome and, while distinct Latin liturgical rites such as the Ambrosian Rite remain, the Roman Rite has over time been adopted almost everywhere in the Western Church. In medieval times there were very many local variants, even if they did not all amount to distinct rites, but uniformity grew as a result of the invention of printing and in obedience to the decrees of the 1545–1563 Council of Trent (see Quo primum). Several Latin liturgical rites that survived into the 20th century were abandoned voluntarily in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. The Roman Rite is now the most widespread liturgical rite not only in the Latin Church but in Christianity as a whole. The Roman Rite has been adapted over the centuries and the history of its Eucharistic liturgy can be divided into three stages: the Pre-Tridentine Mass, Tridentine Mass and Mass of Paul VI. It is now normally celebrated in the form promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 and revised by Pope John Paul II in 2002, but use of the 1962 Roman Missal remains authorized as an extraordinary form under the conditions indicated in the 2007 papal document Summorum Pontificum. Comparison with Eastern rites The Roman Rite is noted for its sobriety of expression.\\"Bishop succinctly characterizes the 'genius of the Roman rite' as being 'marked by simplicity, practicality, a great sobriety and self-control, gravity and dignity'\\" (James Norman, Handbook to the Christian Liturgy - Regional Rites V). In its Tridentine form, it was noted also for its formality: the Tridentine Missal minutely prescribed every movement, to the extent of laying down that the priest should put his right arm into the right sleeve of the alb before putting his left arm into the left sleeve (Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, I, 3). Concentration on the exact moment of change of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ has led, in the Roman Rite, to the consecrated Host and the chalice being shown to the people immediately after the Words of Institution. If, as was once most common, the priest offers Mass while facing ad apsidem (towards the apse), ad orientem (towards the east) if the apse is at the east end of the church, he shows them to the people, who are behind him, by elevating them above his head. As each is shown, a bell (once called \\"the sacring bell\\") is rung and, if incense is used, the host and chalice are incensed (General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 100). Sometimes the external bells of the church are rung as well. Other characteristics that distinguish the Roman Rite from the rites of the Eastern Catholic Churches are genuflections and keeping both hands joined together. Antiquity of the Roman Mass In his 1912 book on the Roman Mass, Adrian Fortescue wrote: \\"Essentially the Missal of Pius V is the Gregorian Sacramentary; that again is formed from the Gelasian book, which depends on the Leonine collection. We find the prayers of our Canon in the treatise de Sacramentis and allusions to it in the 4th century. So our Mass goes back, without essential change, to the age when it first developed out of the oldest liturgy of all. It is still redolent of that liturgy, of the days when Caesar ruled the world and thought he could stamp out the faith of Christ, when our fathers met together before dawn and sang a hymn to Christ as to a God. The final result of our inquiry is that, in spite of unsolved problems, in spite of later changes, there is not in Christendom another rite so venerable as ours.\\" In a footnote he added: \\"The prejudice that imagines that everything Eastern must be old is a mistake. Eastern rites have been modified later too; some of them quite late. No Eastern Rite now used is as archaic as the Roman Mass.\\"Fr. Adrian Fortescue, The Mass: A Study of the Roman Liturgy, s.l., 1912, p. 213 In the same book, Fortescue acknowledged that the Roman Rite underwent profound changes in the course of its development. His ideas are summarized in the article on the \\"Liturgy of the Mass\\" that he wrote for the Catholic Encyclopedia (published between 1907 and 1914) in which he pointed out that the earliest form of the Roman Mass, as witnessed in Justin Martyr's 2nd-century account, is of Eastern type, while the Leonine and Gelasian Sacramentaries, of about the 6th century, \\"show us what is practically our present Roman Mass\\". In the interval, there was what Fortescue called \\"a radical change\\". He quoted the theory of A. Baumstark that the Hanc Igitur, Quam oblationem, Supra quæ and Supplices, and the list of saints in the Nobis quoque were added to the Roman Canon of the Mass under \\"a mixed influence of Antioch and Alexandria\\", and that \\"St. Leo I began to make these changes; Gregory I finished the process and finally recast the Canon in the form it still has.\\"New Advent website. Fortescue himself concluded: : We have then as the conclusion of this paragraph that at Rome the Eucharistic prayer was fundamentally changed and recast at some uncertain period between the fourth and the sixth and seventh centuries. During the same time the prayers of the faithful before the Offertory disappeared, the kiss of peace was transferred to after the Consecration, and the Epiklesis was omitted or mutilated into our \\"Supplices\\" prayer. Of the various theories suggested to account for this it seems reasonable to say with Rauschen: \\"Although the question is by no means decided, nevertheless there is so much in favour of Drews's theory that for the present it must be considered the right one. We must then admit that between the years 400 and 500 a great transformation was made in the Roman Canon\\" (Euch. u. Busssakr., 86). In the same article Fortescue went on to speak of the many alterations that the Roman Rite of Mass underwent from the 7th century on (see Pre-Tridentine Mass), in particular through the infusion of Gallican elements, noticeable chiefly in the variations for the course of the year. This infusion Fortescue called the \\"last change since Gregory the Great\\" (who died in 604). The Eucharistic Prayer normally used in the Byzantine Rite is attributed to Saint John Chrysostom, who died in 404, exactly two centuries before Pope Gregory the Great. The East Syrian Eucharistic Prayer of Addai and Mari, which is still in use, is certainly much older. Liturgy and traditionsRoman Missal= 2002 edition of the Missale Romanum The Roman Missal () is the liturgical book that contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the Mass in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Before the high Middle Ages, several books were used at Mass: a Sacramentary with the prayers, one or more books for the Scriptural readings, and one or more books for the antiphons and other chants. Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves. Such a book was referred to as a Missale Plenum (). In response to reforms called for in the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V promulgated, in the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum of 14 July 1570, an edition of the Roman Missal that was to be in obligatory use throughout the Latin Church except where there was a traditional liturgical rite that could be proved to be of at least two centuries’ antiquity. The version of the Mass in the 1570s edition became known as the Tridentine Mass. Various relatively minor revision were made in the centuries following, culminating in the 1962 edition promulgated by Pope John XXIII. Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council that same year, whose participating bishops ultimately called for renewal and reform of the liturgy. The 1969 edition of the Roman Missal was promulgated by Pope Paul VI, issued in response to the council, introduced several major revisions, including simplifying the rituals and permitting translations into local vernacular languages. The version of the Mass in this missal, known colloquially as the Mass of Paul VI, is currently in use throughout the world. =Arrangement of churches= The Roman Rite no longer has the pulpitum, or rood screen, a dividing wall characteristic of certain medieval cathedrals in northern Europe, or the iconostasis or curtain that heavily influences the ritual of some other rites. In large churches of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance the area near the main altar, reserved for the clergy, was separated from the nave (the area for the laity) by means of a rood screen extending from the floor to the beam that supported the great cross (the rood) of the church and sometimes topped by a loft or singing gallery. However, by about 1800 the Roman Rite had quite abandoned rood screens, although some fine examples survive. =Chant= Gregorian chant is the traditional chant of the Roman Rite. Being entirely monophonic, it does not have the dense harmonies of present-day chanting in the Russian and Georgian churches. Except in such pieces as the graduals and alleluias, it does not have melismata as lengthy as those of Coptic Christianity. However, the music of the Roman Rite became very elaborate and lengthy when Western Europe adopted polyphony. While the choir sang one part of the Mass the priest said that part quietly to himself and continued with other parts, or he was directed by the rubrics to sit and wait for the conclusion of the choir's singing. Therefore it became normal in the Tridentine Mass for the priest to say Mass, not sing it, in contrast to the practice in all Eastern rites. Only on special occasions and in the principal Mass in monasteries and cathedrals was the Mass sung.

The film was produced by Walter R. Cichy, Bill Osco, and Howard Ziehm. It was co-directed by Ziehm and Michael Benveniste, who also wrote the screenplay. The cast includes Jason Williams, Suzanne Fields, and William Dennis Hunt. The film was distributed by Mammoth Films. The film's storyline is purposely reminiscent of the first Universal Pictures Flash Gordon multi- chapter movie serial, Flash Gordon (1936), but written and directed with a purposely campy flavor. The planet Porno (in the serial: Mongo) and major characters are suggestive innuendos: the hero Flesh Gordon (Flash Gordon); his love interest Dale Ardor (Dale Arden); the evil Emperor Wang the Perverted (Ming the Merciless); scientist Dr. Flexi Jerkoff (Dr. Alexi Zarkov); seductive Amora, Queen of Magic (Ming's daughter Aura); and effeminate Prince Precious (Prince Barin). The film features production values comparable to the original serial, as well as stop-motion animation of creatures, and frequent use of gratuitous nudity and brief sex scenes. Plot Distinguished Professor Gordon (John Hoyt) explains that Earth is being tormented by periodic \\"sex rays\\", which send people into a sexual frenzy. When one of the rays hits the Ford Trimotor passenger aircraft carrying Flesh Gordon (Jason Williams) and Dale Ardor (Suzanne Fields), the pilots abandon the controls and everyone aboard has manic sex. When they finish, Flesh and Dale escape the imminent plane crash by parachute. They land near the workshop of Flexi Jerkoff (Joseph Hudgins), who has a plan to stop the sex rays at their source. They travel to the planet Porno in Jerkoff's phallic rocket ship, and are briefly hit by a sex ray, resulting in a frantic three-way orgy. They crash land after being shot down by the minions of Emperor Wang (William Dennis Hunt) and are attacked by several one-eyed \\"Penisauruses\\" before being taken prisoner by Wang's soldiers. They are brought before Wang, who is presiding over an orgy of more than a dozen men and women. Jerkoff is sent to work in Wang's laboratory, while Wang announces his intention to marry Dale. Flesh is sentenced to death, but is saved when Queen Amora (Nora Wieternik) instead takes him to be her sex slave. Wang shoots down Amora's ship, and Flesh is the only survivor. He is reunited with Jerkoff, and they resume their efforts to defeat Wang, now using Amora's Power Pasties. Wang and Dale's wedding is interrupted when Dale is kidnapped by Amazonian lesbians, whose leader, Chief Nellie (Candy Samples), attempts to initiate Dale into their cult. Flesh and Jerkoff save her, unexpectedly aided by Prince Precious (Mycle Brandy) of the Forest Kingdom. With help from their new ally, Jerkoff builds a weapon to destroy the sex ray. They confront Wang and trick his \\"rapist robots\\" into turning on him, but Wang escapes, seeking the aid of the towering idol of the Great God Porno. Porno comes to life and captures Dale as they flee, blandly commenting on his actions. Jerkoff shoots the living idol, freeing Dale and causing the god to fall on Wang and the sex ray. Flesh, Dale, and Jerkoff are celebrated as heroes and return to Earth.

Osco intended to hold out for a major distributor to pay a $1 million advance to secure the American release rights. The film was first assigned a MPAA rating of X, but was then re-edited, finally receiving a reclassified rating of R. The film's original running time was 78 minutes, but the later, unrated \\"collector's edition\\" video release runs 90 minutes. Flesh Gordon employed special effects artists who would later gain Hollywood fame, including Mike Minor, Greg Jein and Rick Baker. Established effects artists Jim Danforth (listed backward in the film credits as Mij Htrofnad) and Dave Allen also worked on the film. The film's low-budget special effects were achieved using old-fashioned techniques: For example, the model of Wang's palace was created using everyday objects, such as drinking glasses, and was designed to resemble Griffith Observatory so actual footage shot at the base of the observatory could be easily integrated into the film. Los Angeles-area Star Trek fan and writer Bjo Trimble was a makeup artist on Flesh Gordon; she described these experiences in her book On the Good Ship Enterprise: My 15 Years with Star Trek. Other Los Angeles-area science fiction fans worked, at times, in various capacities on the film, including science fiction and fantasy artist George Barr who designed and illustrated the film's one-sheet movie poster, and Cornelius Cole III, who animated the film's opening title credits sequence. Longtime fan and science fiction and fantasy writer Tom Reamy served in the film's art department as the production's property master. He tracked down many of the screen-used props in the film, including authentic, full-sized Ford Trimotor wicker passenger seats (matching the film's Tri-Motor aircraft miniature) used in an early scene in the film. The towering creature was not originally intended to speak, but it proved so expressive that dialogue was dubbed over to match its mouth movements. Addressed as the Great God Porno in this dialogue, the special effects crew named him \\"Nesuahyrrah\\", a tribute to stop- motion animation master Ray Harryhausen, spelling his name backwards.Pettigrew, Neil, The Stop Motion Filmography, McFarland & Company, 1999, p. 251. According to Ziehm's DVD audio commentary, the film was originally shot using scenes of straight and gay hardcore pornography. These were cut after Ziehm found himself in legal trouble: Producing pornography in Los Angeles was legally viewed as pandering at that time. The X-rated footage was surrendered to L.A. vice police. Although some explicit shots can be briefly seen during Wang's throne room orgy scenes, the \\"collector's edition\\" video, labelled \\"the original, uncensored version\\", is no more explicit than any of the earlier video releases. Also according to Ziehm's DVD audio commentary, Universal Studios was planning to sue Graffiti Productions over the first part of Flesh Gordon being too similar to the first chapter of Universal's 1936 Flash Gordon serial film that it bordered on plagiarism. To avoid a lawsuit, Ziehm added an opening text scroll that stated that Flesh Gordon was a burlesque style parody of the Depression Era superheroes of America's past; he also added \\"Not to be confused with the original Flash Gordon\\" to all advertising materials. Critical reception Vivian Sobchack commented that Flesh Gordon is \\"a skin flick hilariously molded around the Flash Gordon serials, and fully and lovingly aware of genre conventions from special effects to dialogue\\". The film was nominated for the 1975 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (the only indie production nominated that year), but lost to Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives Flesh Gordon a \\"fresh\\" rating of 67%. Legacy A sequel, Flesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders, followed in 1990.

The theory argues that the legal form is the parallel of the commodity form under capitalist society. All law is concerned with the process of the exchanging of commodities between subjects who act as the \\"guardians\\" of commodities and are created by law in order to enable the commodity production form of society to function. The theory can be explained as based on two premises, logical and historical. The logical premise \\"Every legal relation\\" proclaims Pashukanis, \\"is a relation between subjects\\". Pashukanis' conceptual account of law begins with the idea of a responsible agent - what he calls \\"the legal subject\\". Property, says Pashukanis, is the basis of the legal form, but only capitalist property that can be disposed of in the market. The subject in law is the expression of the freedom of property, that is, the freedom of alienate property. Thus the key to understanding law is the contradiction between commodities and subjects. Commodities according to Karl Marx relate to each other as values, that is exchange takes place on the basis of equivalent amounts of labour-time embodied in commodities passing between buyers and sellers, indicating that there are social relations among things and material relations among people. Contract is both logically the central legal premise on which all other aspects of law are based, and also the highest form of expression of the commodity owning subject. This is because it is the relations of contract that are crucial for commodity production society since the contract is the necessary legal expression of commodity owners' ability to use their commodities in the market. For Pashukanis, all other forms of legal relations in capitalism flow from this. The historical premise The commodity form of exchange historically precedes the legal system which emerges from it. But it is not merely that the commodity form produces the legal form; it is that the commodity form exists prior to the legal form and that only with the full development of the commodity form is there the possibility of a fully developed abstract legal form at all. Fetishism Commodity form theory is related to Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. Marx argued that the commodity was a fetishized form because the formal equality that the commodity form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as the commodity form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as the commodity form, exists independently of the will of the individual. The illusion is produced that the law – as the universal political equivalent – has a life of its own.

It was written in three writing systems: Egyptian hieroglyphs, demotic, and Greek, on several ancient Egyptian memorial stones, or steles. The inscription is a record of a great assembly of priests held at Canopus, Egypt, on 7 Appellaios (Mac.) = 17 Tybi (Eg.) year 9 of Ptolemy III = Thursday 7 March 238 BCE (proleptic Julian calendar). Their decree honoured Pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes; Queen Berenice, his wife; and Princess Berenice.Robinson Ellis, A Commentary on Catullus, Adamant Media Corporation 2005, , p. 295 Copies of the Decree In 1866, Karl Richard Lepsius discovered at Tanis the first copy of this Decree (this copy was originally known as the 'Şân Stele'). Another copy was found in 1881 by Gaston Maspero at Kom el-Hisn in the western Nile Delta. Later on, some other fragmentary copies were found. In March 2004, while excavating at Bubastis, the German-Egyptian 'Tell Basta Project' archaeologists discovered yet another well preserved copy of the Decree. Importance for the decipherment of hieroglyphs This is the second earliest of the series of trilingual inscriptions of the \\"Rosetta Stone Series\\", also known as Ptolemaic Decrees. There are four such Decrees, the earliest is the Decree of Alexandria from 243 BCE, the third being the Decree of Memphis, for Ptolemy IV in 218 BCE, and the fourth, final decree, being the Memphis Decree Rosetta Stone, inscribed for Ptolemy V, in 196 BCE. Having a greater number of different hieroglyphs than the Rosetta Stone, the Canopus Stone has proved crucial in deciphering them. Contents of the inscription The inscription touches on subjects such as military campaigns, famine relief, Egyptian religion and governmental organization in Ptolemaic Egypt. It mentions the king's donations to the temples, his support for the Apis and Mnevis cults, which enjoyed huge success in the Macedonian – Egyptian world, and the return of divine statues which had been carried off by Cambyses. It extols the king's success in quelling insurgencies of native Egyptians, operations referred to as 'keeping the peace.' It reminds the reader that during a year of low inundation, the government had remitted taxes and imported grain from abroad. It inaugurates the most accurate solar calendar known to the ancient world, with 365¼ days per year. It declares the deceased princess Berenike a goddess and creates a cult for her, with women, men, ceremonies, and special 'bread-cakes'. Lastly it orders the decree to be incised in stone or bronze in both hieroglyphs and Greek, and to be publicly displayed in the temples.The Canopus Decree The Decree of Canopus attested the existence of the ancient city of Heracleion, which is now submerged, and has only recently been excavated. The Decree informed us, in its Greek version, that a synod of priests was held in the city of Heracleion during the reign of King Ptolemy I.PDF file Research by Franck Goddio Calendar reform The traditional Egyptian calendar had 365 days: twelve months of thirty days each and an additional five epagomenal days. According to the reform, the five-day \\"Opening of the Year\\" ceremonies would include an additional sixth day every fourth year.Canopic reform The reason given was that the rise of Sothis advances to another day in every 4 years, so that attaching the beginning of the year to the heliacal rising of the star Sirius would keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons. This Ptolemaic calendar reform failed, but was finally officially implemented in Egypt by Augustus in 26 or 25 BCE, now called the Alexandrian calendar,Marshall Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book, Diane 1989, , p.47 with a sixth epagomenal day occurring for the first time on 29 August 22 BCE.Egyptian Civil Calendar Julius Caesar had earlier implemented a day year in Rome in 45 BCE as part of the Julian calendar.

Many flatbreads are unleavened, although some are leavened, such as pizza and pita bread. Flatbreads range from below one millimeter to a few centimeters thick so that they can be easily eaten without being sliced. They can be baked in an oven, fried in hot oil, grilled over hot coals, cooked on a hot pan, tava, comal, or metal griddle, and eaten fresh or packaged and frozen for later use. History In 2018, charred bread crumbs were found at a Natufian site called Shubayqa 1 in Jordan (in Harrat ash Shaam, the Black Desert) dating to 12,400 BC, some 4,000 years before the start of agriculture in the region.

Early years Lampe (1914) Early films (c. 1890-1910) merely relied on classical and popular repertory, mixed usually with improvisation by whatever accompanist was playing (usually a pianist). Around 1910, folios of photoplay music began being published by companies such as Sam Fox Music and Academic Music. These were only a minute or so long and could not sustain an entire feature, but were used to fill in scenes where music was not popularly written (such as \\"misteriosos\\" for scenes of mystery, etc.). One example of such a piece is Mysterioso Pizzicato, which appeared in a 1914 photoplay music collection compiled by J. Bodewalt Lampe and whose main motif has endured as a cliche for stealth and villainy in a wide selection of music and films thereafter.Fuld, James J. (2000) The Book Of World-Famous Music, 5th ed. Dover Publications. p. 385 A version of this theme is contrasted with a hero's theme ().Braun, Wilbur (1989). Foiled Again: Two Musical Melodramas, p.4. Samuel French. . Composers noted for their photoplay music include John Stepan Zamecnik and Gaston Borch. Types of scores When it comes to producing a film score for a silent film, there were three types: improvised, compiled, and original. =Improvisational= Improvised scores were solely played on organ or piano. The musical conductor played whatever he felt necessary to set the mood for the scene. =Compiled= According to Richard Koszarski's book \\"An Evening's Entertainment\\", a survey was sent out in the mid-1920s to 10,000 out of about 15,000 theaters in America. Of those that responded to the survey, approximately 50% used theater organs, 25% used piano only, and 25% used orchestras (two or more players). For those using orchestras, improvisation was difficult and a compiled score was preferred. The studio would hire a company to produce a cue sheet; generally three to four pages of listings of photoplay music, classical or popular standards from their library. This concept of a \\"compilation score\\" was invented around 1910. The Edison Film Company was among the first to use this method of scoring film. The cue sheet would list the title and author of a song, when to play it, roughly how long to play it for, and the publisher of the piece. Quite often, further notes were given of sound effects, tempo, and so on, so that every important factor of the film could be supervised. The musical director of a theater then went through the theater's music collection (generally listed by tempo) and picked out the appropriate cue. If he did not have that particular cue, he could replace it with another suitable piece, or order it through the company that created the cue sheet. A typical theater's music library could consist of a couple thousand to tens of thousands of pieces, depending on the budget of the theater. A typical cue sheet. This example is Ernst Luz's compilation for London After Midnight (1927), as published by Cameo Thematic Music, Inc. In 1923, the Cameo Thematic Music Co. was established by M.J. Mintz, and by the end of the decade, was responsible for about 90% of cue sheets. Ernst Luz and James C. Bradford were the most prolific compilers for Cameo. Other music companies, such as Belwin Inc., also printed cue sheets. Belwin's cue sheets were generally compiled by Max Winkler. Some conductors compiled their own scores rather than use cue sheets; some followed the cue sheet, but used their own choices of music; many followed the cue sheet with what little time they had to produce an opera's worth of music. Much of the time, musicians came in and sight-read their parts, with little to no time to rehearse. =Original= Original scores were the minority. Scores published were generally the premiere score that was played in the New York theaters. These were often compiled scores with some original material, such as Joseph Carl Breil's score for The Birth of a Nation, the William Axt/David Mendoza scores for the 1925 film Ben Hur or the 1926 film The Big Parade. Even fewer were all-original scores, the most notable being Gottfried Huppertz's scores for Fritz Lang's Nibelungen films and Metropolis, and composer Mortimer Wilson's for Douglas Fairbanks's The Thief of Baghdad. With the little time available between the completion of the picture and when it was to be released, all-original scores were uneconomical and had themes that were generally written in advance. Later years The last days of photoplay music were of the era of 1927-1930, when sound films became popular. Silent films already made were generally released with orchestral soundtracks compiled of photoplay music and sound effects. Some photoplay music was used as incidental music in early sound films as well. Most theaters, however, threw out entire libraries of music. Publishers junked overstock or used it as scrap paper. In recent years, photoplay music has been revitalized through home videos and live performances of silent films. Many videos of silent films have premiere or cue sheet scores recorded for posterity.

The Magic Toyshop (1967) is a British novel by Angela Carter. It follows the development of the heroine, Melanie, as she becomes aware of herself, her environment, and her own sexuality. Plot summary The novel starts with Melanie stealing her mother's wedding dress and venturing out in the night into her family's property. However, on her way home, she realises she forgot the door key and is forced to climb up a tree to get back into her room, destroying the dress in the process. The next morning, Melanie learns of the unexpected deaths of her parents in a plane crash over the Grand Canyon, and she and her two siblings – Victoria and Jonathon – are moved to South London, to the care of her tyrannical uncle Philip, a bullish and eccentric maker of life-sized puppets and fantastical old fashioned toys. There, she meets her mute aunt Margaret, who is mistreated by and terrified of her husband and only converses through notes. She also meets Margaret's younger brothers Francie, a fiddler, and the rakish Finn. At first, Uncle Philip ignores Melanie and her siblings as they are introduced to his bizarre puppet shows and she is made to work selling toys in the toyshop. Meanwhile, Finn and Melanie grow closer until he takes her to a park which is the ruins of the National Exhibition of 1852. There, after seeing a worn, fallen statue of Queen Victoria and walking across a chess board (only on the white squares), Finn kisses Melanie. She feels intruded on by the gesture, imagining it to be romantic only as an observer from far away. The kiss begins Melanie's conflicted feelings of attraction toward Finn. At another puppet show, Finn fails to control his puppet and is thrown to the floor by Uncle Philip, who despises him. Satisfied that Finn shall never be adept at working the puppets, Uncle Philip devises a new plan, drafting Melanie to perform with the puppets. Philip assigns Finn to teach Melanie how to act on stage for the future show. During this time, Melanie notices a difference in Finn's behaviour. Whereas before he had been subtly rebellious, he now seems depleted of all resistance and resigned to Philip's control. Finn also becomes even more physically dirty than before. However, Finn's opposition to Philip returns when he refuses to make love to Melanie, as he considers this to be part of Philip's machinations. Soon the day of the puppet show arrives. Melanie appears on stage in a white dress. Philip has arranged for Melanie to play Leda as she is raped by the god Jove in the guise of a monstrous swan. However, the play is not successful, as Melanie struggles to beat off the swan. As she scrambles to escape the swan puppet, Finn calls for the end of the show. In a rage, Philip slaps Melanie and accuses her of ruining his show. Shortly after the show, Uncle Philip goes on a business trip, taking Jonathon with him and leaving the rest of the family alone at the house. Finn decides to destroy Philip's puppet swan and buries it in the park next to the fallen Queen Victoria. He returns home and crawls into bed with Melanie. She comforts him and arrives at the realisation that they will someday marry and have children, leading a poor, constrained life together. Finn reaches a sort of epiphany about his life and decides to wash and not tolerate Uncle Philip's hegemony any more, something exemplified when Finn sits in Uncle Philip's seat at the dinner table. After a somewhat drunken evening, Melanie learns that Margaret and Francie have been having an incestuous relationship. Suddenly Uncle Philip returns, discovering the infidelity of his wife and the rebellion of his household. In a tremendous rage, he sets the house on fire. Margaret finally speaks as she urges Finn and Melanie to escape. They do so just in time, running outside the house and turning to watch the floors of the house collapse in fire. They realise now that their old world is destroyed and, for better or worse, all they have left is each other. Film adaptation The novel was filmed in 1987. It was produced by Steve Morrison and directed by David Wheatley.

The topmast is highlighted in red. The masts of traditional sailing ships were not single spars, but were constructed of separate sections or masts, each with its own rigging. The topmast is one of these. The topmast is semi-permanently attached to the upper front of the lower mast, at the top. Its shrouds run to the edges of the top, rather than to the sides of the hull, though long shrouds leading well aft to the hull, more in the manner of backstays, are sometimes seen. In accordance with the standard square rig sail plan, the topmast carries the topsail. In the late 19th century, however, topsails became so big that merchant ships began to divide them into two separate sails for easier handling; since these were still on the topmast they were known as upper and lower topsails to preserve the consistency of the naming scheme. The majority of large square- riggers today carry separate upper and lower topsails. The main topmast carries the upper end of the main-topmast-staysail; a mizzen-topmast may carry the equivalent. The fore-topmast will carry a staysail, but depending on where the lower end of the stay is attached it may be called a fore-topmast-staysail or an inner jib. When steel masts were introduced, with their lengths no longer limited by the height of a tree, ships were often constructed with single spars serving as both lower mast and topmast. In every other respect, however, the \\"topmast\\" lived on, with separate shrouds to the lower mast and a top between the two. The section of mast immediately above the top was often painted white as the lower masthead used to be, with the section of the steel mast representing the topmast continuing on above in its usual colour. Topgallant masts and royal masts were similarly combined, though, being shorter, they were often one spar even in the days of wood. A common arrangement on tall ships now in use is a steel spar as lower and topmast, surmounted by a wooden mast as topgallant and royal.

Genetic analyses indicated low differentiation between northern and southern populations in Florida. A population on the Bahamas showed moderate to high differentiation compared with Florida populations. The Bahama nuthatch was and still is considered a subspecies (S. p. insularis) by several authorities including the IOC, but the IUCN and BirdLife International have reclassified it as its own separate species. The bird, like other nuthatches, possesses a sharp black nail-like beak, which it uses to pound open seeds. It is a frequent visitor to feeding stations and is highly fond of sunflower seeds and suet cakes. Bold and inquisitive, this bird is readily approachable by humans. The bird is frequently observed using a small chip of bark held in its beak as a tool to dig for insects. Despite the other species' common name, the brown- headed nuthatch is about the same size as the pygmy nuthatch and the two species are the world's smallest nuthatches. In the brown-headed nuthatch, the total length is , wingspan is and body mass is . This species sports a brown cap with narrow black eyeline and buff white cheeks, chin, and belly. Its wings are bluish-gray in color. A small white spot is found at the nape of the neck. The bird's call is a sharp whee-hyah sounding very similar to a \\"rubber duck\\" toy and particularly is loud for a bird its size. They also make softer \\"pit pit pit\\" calls while in flight as well as other squeaking noises. If heard or seen well, this species is virtually unmistakable in the wild, since it overlaps only with the very differently marked and larger red-breasted and white-breasted nuthatches.

Retrieved 2016-07-02. The advent of online shopping has resulted in the rapid development of many rewards programs that offer incentives for shopping. These programs may be points-based (redeemable for products or vouchers), cashback, airline frequent flyer-miles-based, hotel points, donations to charity, or even carbon offsets. These programs are often presented to the consumer as coalitions of large numbers of retailers, but are probably better described as competitive loyalty programs, to differentiate them from their precursors the original single retailer non-competitive loyalty program. The marketing model Rewards portals have grown very rapidly in most major markets, especially in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. While they have roots in traditional off-line non-competitive loyalty programs, such portals often add considerably greater value to the customer than their traditional off-line equivalent, which accounts for their dramatic growth and high levels of customer acceptance. Cash back and reward-based websites operate using a marketing model known as affiliate marketing, which is a performance-based marketing tool. Affiliate marketing networks make it possible to track in detail where users come from (which website is referring the customers), what users buy (down to the product) and when. Rewards-based websites track and reconcile this information with their own user database, and pass on a proportion or even all of the commission received to the customer. From the customer's perspective they are getting something back, usually at no extra cost and often with an additional discount or bonus. From the retailer's perspective, the role and costs of marketing are passed on almost entirely to the affiliate. While hundreds of thousands of websites can easily use affiliate programs to advertise products and retailers (from sports blogs, fanzines through to almost any niche website), cash back and rewards-based programs are much fewer in number, because of the need to track, store, and retrieve individual customer information with a high degree of precision. Typology A particular typology is the incentive program. Online shopping programs tend to be consumer-oriented points-based or cash back programs. Traditional programs focus their proposition on extrinsic motivation and rewards: cash back or a choice of attractive rewards. A variant, though not unique to online shopping programs, is the intrinsic reward. Cause related websites, much like affinity credit card schemes, give their users the opportunity to donate the cash or points to a charity, school, or club. Others still give their users a range of options. With consumer concern about climate change growing, a number of green rewards shopping portals have appeared. Instead of cash back or points these websites offer carbon credits (also known as carbon offsets) or green gadgets to encourage consumers to shop with particular retailers or make changes to their lifestyle. Criticisms Points-based web sites may have different currencies, which makes it difficult to compare the customer benefit. Most reward websites retain a proportion of the commission, and only industry insiders are aware of the nuances of the business model used and therefore the customer benefit. From the consumer's perspective it may not always be clear whether the benefit going to the supported cause is the most effective way of raising funds. For example, in some countries like the UK, a significant tax benefit can be provided to the charity by donating in cash. While the majority of green reward websites also offer some useful information and advice on greener living, few of them seem to encourage more sustainable consumption.

George Howell ran as a Socialist in the city of Calgary but was unsuccessful.Saturday News, March 20, 1909 Despite the two candidates being up against candidates belonging to the popular Liberal government led by Alexander Rutherford, the SPC made a breakthrough by electing its leader, Charles M. O'Brien, to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the electoral district of Rocky Mountain, which was heavily dominated by radical coalminers. O'Brien won a tight race due to high voter turnout in the mining camps. Defeat and decline The party was not very well organized or funded but did run six candidates in the 1913 Alberta general election, electing none of them. Sitting MLA Charles O'Brien was defeated by Conservative candidate Robert Campbell. O'Brien doubled his vote from the previous election, but the collapse of the Liberal vote in the constituency allowed the Conservative to win. The other candidates barely made a showing. The party also ran candidates in 1917 but made little impact. Many of them went on to join the Dominion Labour Party (founded in 1919) and the Canadian Labour Party (founded in 1921). Some became members of the Communist parties being established around 1920. Charles O'Brien helped found the Communist Party of the USA.

It is considered by some to be the most famous barbecue restaurant in the United States. History The restaurant can trace its descent from Henry Perry, the \\"father of Kansas City barbecue\\", who in 1908 began serving smoked meats to workers in the Garment District in Downtown Kansas City from an alley stand. Perry moved to the 18th Street and Vine neighborhood where he sold barbecue for 25 cents a slab from a trolley barn at 19th and Highland. Charlie Bryant worked within the restaurant and was soon joined by his brother Arthur Bryant. In 1940 when Perry died, Charlie took over the restaurant. Arthur in turn was to take it over in 1946. Interior of the location at 18th and Brooklyn The restaurant was located for many years at 18th and Euclid Streets in the inner city neighborhood of 18th and Vine. Bryant moved the business to its present location, 1727 Brooklyn, in 1958. In the 1950s and through the early 1970s, it was visited by fans and players visiting Municipal Stadium, home to the Kansas City Athletics (1955–1967), Kansas City Chiefs (1963–1971) and Kansas City Royals (1969–1972). The stadium was located five blocks south of the restaurant before being razed in 1976. The restaurant has never strayed far from its unpretentious decor with formica tables, fluorescent lighting, and jugs of sauce placed in the windows. While Arthur Bryant's is known for the full range of barbecue dishes, its acknowledged specialty is burnt ends, the flavorful end pieces of smoked beef brisket; burnt end sandwiches are served open-faced at the restaurant. Its sauce (which is characterized by tastes of vinegar and paprika rather than sweetness) is sold on the Internet and by mail, and at various locations including Kansas City International Airport. The restaurant gained fame over the next several decades, and notable diners included President Harry S. Truman. However, it became the subject of international attention when, in 1974, writer Calvin Trillin wrote in Playboy that Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City was \\"...possibly the single best restaurant in the world.\\" Since then, it has been frequented by a number of famous visitors, including Tom Watson (the 8 time major golf champion is a native of Kansas City and currently lives in Stilwell, Kansas), Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, Bryant Gumbel, Jimmy Carter, Jack Nicholson, James Spader, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and in 2008 by Republican presidential nominee John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin, as well as barbecue aficionados. Arthur Bryant died in 1982, and the restaurant is now owned by Katherine Bryant, Samuel Bryant, etc who expanded the restaurant to the Kansas Speedway and Ameristar Casino. The location at Ameristar Casino closed in January 2014, after the restaurant was unable to work out a new lease deal with the casino.

It appeared in the early 19th century mainly under the influence of the Ural handicraft of flower painting on metal. Subsequent development of the Zhostovo painting handicraft was stylistically related to porcelain and enamel painting techniques, used by factories near Moscow, flower motifs on printed cotton, produced by the Ivanovo factories, and Lukutin miniature (see Fedoskino miniature).  History  History of Zhostovo and its handicraft dates back to early 19's century, when in some of Moscows's suburbs and villages of former Troitsk oblast were appeared some workshops for manufacturing painted lacquered products made of papier-mache. Traditions of its painting are in Tagil painting which was appeared in the earlier 18 century. In 1922 «Novoseltsevo work artel» was founded in Novoseltsevo for produce lacquered metal trays; in 1924 «Zhostovo work artel» and «Spetskustar» were founded there; «Lakirovshik» and «Svoy trud» were founded at the same time in 1925 and then all of them were united in 1925 to «Metallopodnos». 1920—1930 were hard for Zhostovo. Common trends of Soviet art of hard standing to modern and realism led to change traditional way of art and applying to Zhostovo patterns of ornaments and conceptual art which were made by professional artists without considering folk art. But lead artist understood the danger of foreignness additions to folk art and managed to resist and lead new ideas to it. Earlier Zhostovo painting was just as a houseware, but now it's independent type of decoration and the craft which was only merchant's hobby was raised to unique unit of Russian folk art. Today, it is called the Zhostovo Factory of Decorative Painting (Жостовская фабрика декоративной росписи).  Production process  Zhostovo painting is a handicraft of painting on metal trays, preliminary coated with a few layers of priming (putty) and oil varnish (usually, black). Painting is done in a few consecutive energetic and firm strokes with a soft brush and oil paints, richly diluted with linseed oil. The most widely used motif of the Zhostovo painting is a bunch of mixed garden and wild flowers, which is simple and laconic in its essence. The edges of a tray are painted with a light golden ornament called уборка (uborka). A finished tray is then covered with three layers of light lacquer and polished to brilliance.

He won the Archibald Prize, Australia's premier award for portrait artists on eight separate occasions; a record held since 1952. Dargie was an official Australian war artist during World War II and painted multiple portraits of Queen Elizabeth II as well as the official portraits of two Prime Ministers of Australia and two Governors-General of Australia. His portrait of Sir Robert Menzies was the front cover of the April 1960 edition of Time Magazine. Dargie painted in a conservative style and is now largely forgotten despite his substantial artistic achievements.  Biography  William Dargie was born in Footscray, Victoria, the first son of Andrew Dargie and Adelaide (née Sargent). His younger brother Horrie Dargie was a noted Australian musician and harmonicist. Portrait of Lt-General the Hon. Edmund Herring for which Dargie won the 1945 Archibald Prize When he was young he met important Australian artists such as Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts. During World War II he served with the Australian Army in the Middle East, New Guinea, India and Burma rising to the rank of Captain. He was digging a trench in Tobruk, Libya, when he was informed that he had won the Archibald Prize in 1942. More than 500 of his paintings, drawings and sketches are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.William Dargie at the Australian War Memorial In December 1954 he was commissioned by Melbourne industrialist James P. Beveridge to paint Australia's official portrait of Queen Elizabeth, who posed for him at Buckingham Palace. This was the first of two portraits he created. The second, a replica of the first, was painted as 'insurance' in case the first was lost in transit to Australia. The original hangs in Australia's Parliament House, while the replica is displayed in the National Museum of Australia. The 'wattle painting', as it became known, was well received by the Australian public and became one of the most recognisable and treasured examples of 20th-century Australian portraiture. Shortly after its completion, colour prints were made available and the work took on the status of official portrait.William Dargie's wattle painting of Queen Elizabeth II, National Museum of Australia For many postwar immigrants this portrait was their first encounter with an artwork by an Australian artist as it was reproduced on Australian naturalisation papers from the mid-1950s. Under the terms of the 1954 Australian Citizenship Convention, a print of the work was generally present in local town halls where many naturalisation ceremonies took place. Dargie painted the Duke of Edinburgh in 1956, as well as official portraits of two Australian Prime Ministers: Sir Arthur Fadden and Sir John McEwen. Other famous Australians who sat for him included such names as Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Dame Enid Lyons and Margaret Court. Other commissions included General John Baker, Chief of the Australian Defence Force. He held positions on several gallery boards, serving on the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board for twenty years. Between 1946 and 1953 he was head of the Victorian Art School at the National Gallery of Victoria. While he is best known for his portraits, he also painted other works, such as smaller interior views, landscapes and still lifes. William Dargie died in Melbourne on 26 July 2003, aged 91, two months after the death of his wife Kathleen (née Howlitt). He was a freemason.Famous &/or Notable Australian Freemasons  Archibald Prize  Dargie won the Archibald Prize more times than any other artist.

He appeared between 2003 and 2005. Storylines Immediately, Ali had a clash of personalities with Liz Burton's son Justin as the pair did not get on. Things got worse for Ali as Justin spiraled towards drug addiction, smoking marijuana, since the pair shared a bedroom. At school, Justin started hanging out with a boy called Steven Mackintosh who sold him the marijuana. Ali was bullied by both Justin and Macki, but as an intelligent and sensitive child, Ali's natural response to this was to ignore the bullying. Ali then made friends with new girl Nicole Owen. Back at home Ali tried to tell both Liz and Richard how he couldn't live with Justin. Little action was taken and it got out of control when Justin pushed Ali's sister, Darlene, through a window. This led to Darlene having a scar and Justin being sent to a boot camp. When Justin returned, Ali could not forgive him, despite Justin trying to tell Ali that he had changed for the better. Eventually, Ali began to believe Justin as the pair began to get along better. Ali started to develop feelings for Nicole, but he never managed to tell how he felt about her as she had fallen for Justin. Despite Nicole fancying his step brother Ali's relationship with Justin became stronger. Ali and Justin's friendship had not gone unnoticed by Macki, who had become angry that Justin didn't want to hang out with him and his gang or buy drugs off him anymore. Macki started to bully Justin and Ali. Ali suffered racial abuse and was called names like Monkey boy. Despite confiding with his sister Darlene, the pair still could not shake off Macki's bullying as it got from bad to worse. In the end it got so bad that both Ali and Justin would not even step outside their house and Justin bought a hunting knife for protection. The knife was found by Ali's dad, Richard who put it in a safe place. Ali then reached breaking point as could not confide in his parents or teachers and decided to take matters in his own hands and it was Ali's unrequited crush on Nicole that eventually proved his undoing. After Nicole rebuked him for being a coward, Ali took the knife, that Richard had confiscated from Justin, from its hiding place and sought out Macki alone. Ali went looking for Macki and challenged him to a fight, Macki led Ali to a deserted area and whilst Ali's back was turned and picked up a brick. Meanwhile, Justin and Darlene found the knife had gone missing and went looking for Ali. The two split up and Justin saw Ali, just as Macki was about to swing the brick. Justin quickly yelled at Ali to watch out and as Macki was about to hit him with a brick, Ali managed to turn around just in time and as an act of self-defence Ali stabbed and killed Macki. Justin then ran up to Ali and told him to give him the knife and run home whilst he would deal with the knife. Scared by his actions, Ali ran in fear as he ran straight out into the street and was hit by a car. Darlene reached Ali just in time to see the accident happen and rode with him in the ambulance. Later in hospital both Ali and Macki died, and Justin hid the knife in the hospital toilets. Days later, Justin was arrested for Macki's murder. However, he was found not guilty.

A subplot has Rob (Michael Landes), the gay son of Leo (Seymour Cassel), trying to convince his father he is straight, with the help of Allison \\"acting\\" as his girlfriend. After Allison and Frankie leave, Rob comes out of the closet to his father, who in fact had known and accepted that Rob was gay for many years.

Rotten Tomatoes gave it a cumulative rating of 50%. Jennifer Aniston's performance was praised by critics. Jeffrey M. Anderson said, \\"Aniston is the breeze in this movie. I was amazed that she of all people was the only one who seemed natural. She seemed to be having a good time, and she seemed in the moment\\". Barbara Shulgasser found her \\"terribly funny\\". Carlo Cavagna added that \\"Jennifer Aniston, who plays Allison, Frankie's best friend, is the most watchable person in this movie. Although she doesn't deviate from the well-established Jennifer Aniston persona, she at least appears to be having fun—teasing Frankie and experimenting with funny accents.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Mick Lasalle's review for the San Francisco Chronicle Category:1990s romantic comedy films Category:1998 LGBT-related films Category:1996 films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Gay-related films Category:Insomnia in film Category:1996 comedy films ","title":"Dream for an Insomniac"},{"id":"2493577","text":"Haggai was a town in Saint Francois County, Missouri, United States, located between Doe Run and Iron Mountain.

The seminary offers a three-year Master of Divinity degree program for students seeking ordination. A two-year Master of Theological Studies degree is offered for students who desire a theological education without seeking the ordained ministry. The school is accredited by TRACS and ATS.  Relationship to the Church  The school is not governed by any particular denomination, thereby allowing it to serve a variety of churches with ministerial training. Throughout its history Mid- America has prepared students for ordained ministry in the following confessionally Reformed and Presbyterian churches: *Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA) *Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) *Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) *Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) *United Reformed Churches in North America (URCNA) Mid-America's commitment to theological education is based on confessional allegiance rather than denominational affiliation. Most faculty and board members were formerly associated with the Christian Reformed Church but are now affiliated with the United Reformed Churches. Additionally, about a third of the faculty are associated with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. All members of the faculty and of the Board of Trustees are committed to the Holy Scriptures as the infallible and inerrant Word of God, and in conformity with the Word are committed to the ecumenical creeds of Christendom (the Apostles' Creed, Athanasian Creed, and Nicene Creed) and the Reformed Confessions (the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Canons of Dort, and the Westminster Confession of Faith) as faithfully setting forth the system of truth taught in Scripture.  History  25th Anniversary logo of Mid-America Reformed Seminary The seminary was founded on April 21, 1981, when a group of Christian Reformed ministers and laymen met at the Hilton Hotel at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. At this meeting, it was decided to establish a seminary society and board of trustees, to purchase the Harmony Youth Home in Orange City, Iowa, to serve as the seminary's campus, and to name the seminary Mid- America Reformed Seminary. The seminary was intended as an alternative to Calvin Theological Seminary, the denominational seminary of the Christian Reformed Church in North America, which the founders of Mid-America believed was straying from its confessional Reformed identity. In 1995 the seminary moved its campus to Dyer, Indiana, where it currently resides. On April 8, 2006, Mid-America held a celebration of its 25th anniversary in the West Commons at Dordt College, and held other 25th anniversary celebrations throughout the United States and Canada in 2006. The school boasts faculty members Cornel Venema, J Mark Beach, Alan Strange, Marcus Mininger, Andrew Compton, and Mark Vander Hart.

The band was formed in the spring of 2002 by Scott Blonde (guitar, vocals) and Lisa Light (vocals, bass) who are the two core members. Light and Blonde met in 2002 via Blonde's manager, whom Light was dating at the time. Shortly afterward Light left her boyfriend, and she began dating Blonde and joined his band Applesaucer. They were forced out of the band, reportedly for making out during practice. Afterward they formed their own band naming themselves The Lovemakers after the Japanese sexploitation film The Weird Lovemakers. They joined with Jason Proctor on keyboards to form the initial lineup. The Lovemakers released a self-titled record in 2003. A second record, Times of Romance, was released on August 23, 2005 on Interscope Records new imprint Cherrytree. A single, \\"Prepare for the Fight\\", was put out in advance of the album's release date. The album also features Josh Freese on drums. In 2006, Proctor departed to return to his day job as a computer programmer full-time. In 2007, The Lovemakers signed to Fuzz, a fledgling San Francisco record label, who released their third album Misery Loves Company on July 24, 2007. The album is an enhanced EP featuring 5 songs and 5 corresponding high-quality music videos. A single, \\"Whine & Dine\\", was put out in advance of the release date. For Misery Loves Company and the subsequent touring the band featured Brandon Arnovick on keyboards and Kenneth Hard on drums. At some point Arnovick and Hard departed, and Hard was replaced by Michael Urbano on drums. Urbano recorded drums on all except for one track on Let's Be Friends, but did not play live with the band after that time. On their tour in support of the album, the band featured Cary LaScala on drums and Gareth Lloyd on synthesizer for live performances. In 2008, The Lovemakers began a production deal with independent music company Talking House Productions (San Francisco) and recorded their fourth album. Talking House Records released the album Let's Be Friends in September 2009 under The Lovemakers' own mark, and the band followed the release with a supporting tour. The label released an advance single called \\"See What I Wanna See\\" on August 11, 2009, which was featured by iTunes on its \\"WHAT'S HOT\\" list and its \\"NEW AND NOTEWORTHY\\" list. Their second single off Let's Be Friends, \\"Love is Dead\\", was featured as a Single of Week on iTunes during the week of September 9, 2009. In December 2009, The Lovemakers announced they would play their last show on New Year's Eve in Oakland at Ghost Town Gallery. This site is near the location of their first performance 7 years earlier. The band was scheduled to perform a one-time-only reunion show on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at The Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco.

He was a six-time United States congressman from Virginia's 9th congressional district from 1907 to 1923 and served as the presidential secretary to President Calvin Coolidge. As a philanthropist, Slemp set up the \\"Slemp Foundation\\", which provides gifts and scholarships to schools and colleges in Southwestern Virginia. Early and family life Slemp was born on September 4, 1870, at Turkey Cove, Virginia, in Lee County to Colonel Campbell Slemp, who later became a United States Representative from the 9th district of Virginia (1903 to 1907). His mother was Nancy (Nannie) Britain Cawood of Harlan County, Kentucky. His father was an officer in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Bascom Slemp had one brother who survived infancy, William Moses Slemp (1873–1912) and three sisters: Emma M. Slemp (1865–1889), Susan Jane Slemp Newman (1869-1935), and Laura Alpha Drucilla Slemp Habourn (1877–1900). Slemp attended the Methodist-run \\"Seminary\\" in Turkey Cove, and had a private tutor (William Davidson of King College), and also at age 9 became a page in the Virginia House of Delegates after his father's election to the Virginia General Assembly in 1879.http://www.swvamusueum.org/cbslemp.htm In 1887, the 16-year-old Slemp entered the Corp of Cadets at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. In 1891, he graduated with the highest grade point average in the school's history — a record that stands today. He also received the Jackson Medal for Most Distinguished Student four years in a row. Bascom Slemp then studied law for a year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1901. He briefly married Roberta Trousdale Barton (1891–1911) in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 26, 1911, but their daughter was stillborn the following year.North Carolina death certificate dated October 15, 1912 at Mission Hospital, Asheville, North Carolina.

She bore daughters Roberta Sue and Grace Council in 1919 and 1924, respectivelyBascom Slemp was listed among the lawyer boarders at a Bethesda, Maryland boardinghouse in the 1920 U.S. Federal Census. Early career Slemp served as Commandant of Cadets at the Marion Military Institute for one year, after which he was hired as the second principal of the Stonega Academy in Big Stone Gap (1893–1895).Sharon B. Ewing, Big Stone Gap, p. 67, available athttps://books.google.com/books?id=uGS1UNoQ7rIC&pg; Slemp then taught at VMI as professor of mathematics for several years. In 1901, after being admitted to the Virginia bar, he resigned his position at the institute to set up a law practice in Big Stone Gap. Slemp became president of the Slemp Coal Company and of the Hamilton Realty Company, among other business interests.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia, available online Political career Slemp being sworn in as presidential secretary, 1923 His father Campbell Slemp served in the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1907, controlling patronage in the state as well as representing Virginia's 9th congressional district until his unexpected death in October 1907. In 1905, Bascom Slemp became chairman of Virginia's Republican State Committee, where he served until 1918, at which point he was elected to the Republican National Committee. Bascom Slemp won the special election to fill his father's vacancy, and also won reelection six times, serving from 1907 until March 3, 1923, after he declined to be a candidate for re-election. As the leading Republican in the Old Dominion, he faced a difficult battle for re-election in 1910, after Democrats persuaded Henry C. Stuart to run against him, and used the slogan \\"Redeem the District.\\" Theodore Roosevelt gave a speech for Slemp, who won by a margin of about 200 votes. Although Stuart initially refused to concede defeat, his contest failed, in part because all 265 precincts had a Democratic registrar, two Democratic clerks and at least two Democratic judges.Guy B. Hathorn, Congressional Campaign in the Fighting Ninth: The Contest between C. Bascom Slemp and Henry C. Stuart, 66 Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 66 (1958) pp.337-344 According to Brent Tarter, The Grandees of Government: the origins and persistence of undemocratic politics in Virginia (University of Virginia Press 2013), Democrat Ebbie Combs of Russell County arranged to have state auditors from Richmond audit the poll tax lists of eligible voters shortly after the deadline, precluding late payment of poll taxes in the district's 15 counties, all then controlled by Republican clerks. On September 4, 1923, six months after Slemp completed his last term as Congressman, President Calvin Coolidge appointed him to serve as his secretary, a post similar to the later White House Chief of Staff. Slemp served until March 4, 1925. He resigned early in Coolidge's second term after friction between himself and the President was unable to be resolved and was succeeded by Everett Sanders. Return to rural life After leaving the Coolidge administration, Slemp returned to his law practice in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover appointed Slemp as United States Commissioner General to the International Colonial and Overseas Exposition in Paris, and at its conclusion in 1931, France awarded Slemp the French Legion of Honor Medal. By the 1930 Census, Slemp lived in Big Stone Gap with his sister S. Janie and her husband John W. Newman and several servants.1930 U.S. Federal Census for Big Stone Gap district 19, Wise County Virginia family 45, house number 820; 1940 census missing or mis-indexed With Janie's help, Slemp established the Southwest Virginia Museum, and after his death, the Commonwealth accepted many pieces bequeathed to it.

Background and recording Following up on 1997's Standing Stone, the concept behind Working Classical was to place pre-existing (and in some cases, very well known) McCartney songs into an orchestral context. Specially for this project, McCartney also unveiled some new pieces, namely \\"Haymakers\\", \\"Midwife\\", \\"Spiral\\" and \\"Tuesday\\". A different performance of \\"A Leaf\\" was originally released on 21 April 1995 on a CD single, and is presented here in a new recording. Performing the new arrangements are the London Symphony Orchestra and the Loma Mar Quartet, with special orchestrations arranged by noted musicians Richard Rodney Bennett, Jonathan Tunick and Andy Stein.Working Classical album notes Album title The title of this project is a pun on the phrase \\"working class\\", in the sense that McCartney, despite his elevated stature, still cherishes his Liverpool roots and is proud of them. Mirroring this ideology is his pride in his rock and roll songs and willingness to transfer them into the \\"elevated\\" classical music genre. Release and reception Paul McCartney's Working Classical was another success in that genre, even though this time it failed to dent the regular US album charts, and was better received critically than his previous effort, Standing Stone.

It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on May 15, 2005.Blind Ambition tv.com. Retrieved on 2007-10-28. In the episode, Peter swallows an excessive number of nickels, causing him to become blind. He later becomes a hero after unwittingly saving Horace the bartender from a fire at his bar, The Drunken Clam, and then regains his sight. Meanwhile, Quagmire is forced to refrain from perverse sexual behavior or risk being driven out of the neighborhood following his arrest for spying on Lois in a ladies' lavatory. Plot At the bowling alley, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game and becomes an overnight celebrity. Lois arrives to pick Peter up from the bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from the ceiling of the ladies' toilet. Quagmire is arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return to the conversation and tells the women that \\"Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!\\" Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by three cheerleaders playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that an attractive blonde lady in a fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking \\"What the hell is CPR?\\"). This upsets Peter, who is disappointed to notice that he is the one amongst his friends who hasn't been successful. In the hope of becoming famous, Peter attempts to set a world record for eating the largest number of nickels, but develops nickel poisoning and loses his vision. Attempting to drown his sorrows, Peter visits his local bar, The Drunken Clam, with his guide dog, unaware that the bar is on fire (caused by God trying to impress a woman). Discovering the bartender Horace trapped under debris, Peter saves his life and is proclaimed a hero by local newsman Tom Tucker. When told that he saved Horace from a burning building, Peter replies with disbelief, \\"That freakin' place was on fire?!\\" For his inadvertent bravery, Peter is awarded a medal by the mayor and receives an eye transplant, the replacement eyes coming from a homeless man dragged to death when Peter accidentally tied his guide dog's leash around the man's neck, thinking he was a parking meter. The end of this episode is an unconnected parody of the closing scene from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Production Steve Callaghan wrote the episode. During Family Guy's third season, the show was cancelled by its network. In preparation in case the show was revived and began broadcasting again, five short scripts were written in 2001 for future episodes. Blind Ambition was developed from one of those scripts. A number of scenes in the episode were removed before broadcast and one, the reappearance of Ernie the Giant Chicken, had originally been set to broadcast in \\"The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire\\". The scene was moved to this episode because \\"The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire\\" already contained a lengthy fight sequence and overran its time allowance. Several of the removed scenes focused on gags showing Peter and his friends attempting to rehabilitate Quagmire, one of which saw Brian Griffin transporting a fork-lift truck load of porn magazines away from Quagmire's house. Since the episode aired, a selection of action figures have been created of Peter acting as Gary, The No Trash Cougar. Show producer David Goodman received many telephone calls complaining about the scene where Peter attempts to seduce his son Chris, mistakenly believing him to be his wife, Lois. The scene was believed by some viewers to be encouraging child molestation. The show also received at least one letter of complaint regarding the scene where Quagmire watches Lois going to the toilet; screenwriter Chris Sheridan comments on the DVD commentary that the number of complaints about this scene exceeded one. It is prohibited on Fox to use the term 'Jesus Christ' without actually referring to the person himself, and so in the scene in which God vaporises a person and exclaims \\"Jesus Christ\\", it was necessary for Jesus to physically appear before the two run away in order for the scene to be suitable for television airing. In addition to the regular cast, actor Gary Cole, actress Gina Gershon, actor Judd Hirsch, voice actress Rachael MacFarlane and actress Lisa Wilhoit guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, actor John G. Brennan, writer Danny Smith, and actress Jennifer Tilly made minor appearances. Cultural references *Stewie discovers the Keebler Elves after crashing into the tree, who plan to kill their competition: Snap, Crackle and Pop, with the help of Judd Hirsch's nuclear weapon, which Peter views while peeking through a ball return at the bowling alley. Later on in the bar, Crackle and Pop are seen discussing an attack by the Keebler Elves which apparently resulted in Snap's death. *Beforehand, a ship crashes through Quahog buildings, a reference to Speed 2: Cruise Control. *In one cutaway scene, W. Frederick Gerhardt's Cycleplane crashing is parodied. *Peter discusses Scrubs with Horace in the bar, a show for which both Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan have written. *In another cutaway scene, Peter recalls living at Superman's Fortress of Solitude with Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman and Aquaman, and being annoyed that they have run out of Mr. PiBB and Cheez-Its. *The entire scene in which Peter receives his award from Mayor West is a reenactment of the ending of the original 1977 Star Wars film, A New Hope; Lucasfilm permitted the reproduction of the characters, music and sounds. *The airplane that defeats Ernie the Giant Chicken in the fight is a mirror reference to the climatic scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. *Stewie being launched into a tree is a reference to The Brady Bunch. Reception PopMatters' Kevin Wong gave the episode a positive review, feeling it was better than the two previous episodes of the season. He commented on the fight scene between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken as \\"a cartoon action sequence to end all cartoon action sequences: vehicles explode and limbs flail as Peter and the chicken beat each other senseless.\\" \\"Blind Ambition\\" was criticized by Mike Drucker of IGN, who found that \\"the long fight with the chicken in Blind Ambition was funny once before, but borderline tiring here\\". However, Drucker also noted that the Star Wars ending was \\"one of my favorite jokes in the series\\".

It is a re- recording of an early B-side by the band (from the \\"Remember Me\\" single). The B-side \\"Zítra Bude Krásný Den\\" is a version of the song translated into Czech. Both versions of the song feature lead vocals by Kateřina Winterová of Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Whilst the original plan had been to teach original vocalist, Hamilton, the Czech lyrics it was thought to be easier to recruit someone else. The song deals with the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by two Czechoslovak agents during World War II. To celebrate the entry of Czech Republic into the European Union it was decided to put out this release as a limited edition of 1,942 copies (the year the operation took place). The two bands also played special shows at Prague's club Roxy and London's Cargo club, and BSP gained a sponsorship deal with Budvar beer. \\"Fakir\\" is not a traditional Czech song - it is rather unknown to Czech listeners. It was written and performed in the 1940s by the Czech hitmakers of the swing era - R.A. Dvorsky and his Melody Boys. The song was recommended to BSP by Jan P.

At numbers 1 and 2 at the time were David Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" and Duran Duran's \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\", respectively. However, it was their next hit, \\"Just Got Lucky\\", that broke the band internationally. This single sold over 250,000 copies, made the UK Top 10, and cracked the U.S. Top 40, reaching number 36 during November 1983 and has been featured in a number of films including Just My Luck and The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

Slater rose to prominence in the 1970s as a businessman and financier, who was the founding Chairman of Slater Walker, an investment bank and conglomerate which collapsed in the secondary banking crisis of 1973–75. CareerEarly career= Born in 1929 in Heswall – at that time in Cheshire – Slater qualified as a chartered accountant aged 24, and joined the Dohm Group. Quickly promoted, he became a general manager, reorganising all the company's small industrial holdings into one company within the group. After leaving Dohm, he was appointed secretary and chief accountant of Park Royal Vehicles, a wholly owned subsidiary of ACV Group. He was then made commercial director of its subsidiary AEC. After Leyland Motors took over ACV, Slater was later promoted to deputy sales director under Donald Stokes. =Initial investments= Whilst working for AEC as a director, Slater fell ill and during his recovery became interested in investing, and developed a system for picking stocks which would much later form the basis of his book The Zulu Principle (1992). He then approached his friend Nigel Lawson, at that time the City Editor of The Sunday Telegraph, and was hired to write an investment column under the pseudonym 'Capitalist'. Over the following two years, Capitalist's ghost portfolio appreciated by 68.9%, against the London Stock Market's average of 3.6%. =Slater Walker= In 1964, Slater acquired control of H Lotery & Co Ltd, a £1.5m public company; he and his business partner Peter Walker – a Conservative MP – renamed it Slater Walker Securities. The company performed what became known as corporate raids on public, mainly industrial, companies, in which Slater would sell off under- performing assets to improve efficiency. This saw the company growing into a group capitalized at over £200 million, through which Slater became a friend and business associate of James Goldsmith. Slater Walker then changed strategy, from a corporate-conglomerate into what eventually was recognised as an unauthorised and unlicensed international investment bank, through gradual disposal of its industrial interests. This has led to Slater being revered in some circles as a \\"merger lord\\", but criticised in others as an \\"asset stripper\\". During the secondary banking crisis in 1975, Slater Walker faced financial difficulties and received support from the Bank of England. Slater resigned as chairman in October 1975, because the government of Singapore began to try to extradite him from the UK for alleged offences by the company in Singapore referring to the alleged misuse of more than £4 million of company funds in share deals. The Singapore government's attempt to extradite Slater (in which it was represented by Derry Irvine, assisted by Tony Blair and Cherie Booth) was dismissed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court in 1977. In separate proceedings, following the takeover of the company by the Bank of England, a prosecution was brought against Slater by the Department of Trade alleging 15 counts of offences under the Companies Act. Slater was found guilty of the Companies Act offences and fined £15 per count. However, the court accepted that the offences were purely technical, that Slater had not acted dishonestly and that there was no question of him having made any personal gain through committing them. Finding himself, after the collapse of Slater Walker, technically but not legally bankrupt, Slater invested his residual funds and repaid all of his personal creditors within a few years, with interest. In 1976, Slater had formed a 50:50 venture with Tiny Rowland's Lonrho Group, to buy-up undervalued blocks of flats in London. At its peak, the company owned and managed over 1,500 flats. This business model led Slater to form Salar Properties, which through time share leasing of salmon fishing rights on seven of Scotland's rivers, including the Lower Redgorton beat on the River Tay, by the 1980s had become the largest Scottish fishing venture. Slater then acted as mentor to business partner Ian Watson, through which Watson founded Centennial Minerals in 1982. It owned a major share in the Montana Tunnels gold mine, and was sold to Pegasus Gold at a substantial profit three years later. The pair formed Galahad Gold in 2002, successfully timing the commodities boom to make annualised 66% profits from gold exploration before winding the company down in 2007 and starting a new joint-venture, Agrifirma, this time investing in Brazilian agricultural farmland.Financial Times – Agrifirma scraps hedge fund- style fees, 9 March 2009 By 2009, Slater was chairman of BioProjects International PLC, deputy chairman and finance director of Galahad Gold, and investment director of Agrifirma. Author Slater's autobiography sets out his early plans and visions regarding company acquisitions, and describes the processes he employed to bring them about. Once companies came under his control his strategy was to maximise the return on those of their assets that he judged disposable—be they property, plant or workforce. These tactics proved to be highly successful and profitable in the short-term, such that \\"Slater Walker\\" became a byword for a particularly forceful and financially rewarding form of capitalism. The acquisition and disposal of company assets in this manner became known as \\"asset stripping\\", a phrase term that carries with it connotations of hardship and distress associated with the human costs of unemployment. Some years later, Slater acknowledged the drawbacks that were inherent in the practices he adopted, towards the end of an interview with Hunter Davies in The Independent published on 15 December 1992. Slater was also the author of a book on investment, The Zulu Principle, which focuses on simple techniques for identifying small dynamic growth companies whose shares are at a low price compared to their future prospects. With Hemmington Scott, he devised a monthly company statistical guide, Company REFS, also available as a daily online service, to make the identification of such shares easier for the private investor. Slater authored several other investment books, and had a side career as a children's author, writing the A. Mazing Monsters series. Media  He was featured in the second episode of The Mayfair Set, a series of documentaries by Adam Curtis. Personal life Slater married his wife Helen in 1965. They lived in Surrey and had four children and ten grandchildren. Slater's hobby was chess. Amongst other sponsorships he donated $125,000 to make possible the 1972 World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in Reykjavík, Iceland, doubling the total prize fund. Slater died on 18 November 2015 at the age of 86. Bibliography *A.

courtyard Palazzo Strozzi is a palace in Florence, Italy. History The construction of the palace was begun in 1489 by Benedetto da Maiano, for Filippo Strozzi the Elder, a rival of the Medici who had returned to the city in November 1466 and desired the most magnificent palace to assert his family's continued prominence and, perhaps more important,Goldthwaite 1968. a political statement of his own status.Heather Gregory, \\"The Return of the Native: Filippo Strozzi and Medicean Politics\\" Renaissance Quarterly 38.1 (Spring 1985), pp. 1–21. A great number of other buildings were acquired during the 1470s and demolished to provide enough space for the new construction. Giuliano da Sangallo provided a wood model of the design.Richard Goldthwaite, \\"The building of the Strozzi palace: the construction industry in Renaissance Florence\\" Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History 10 (1973) pp99-135. Filippo Strozzi died in 1491, long before the construction's completion in 1538. Duke Cosimo I de' Medici confiscated it in the same year, not returning it to the Strozzi family until thirty years later. The palace faces the historical Via de' Tornabuoni. Description Palazzo Strozzi is an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Unlike the Medici Palace, which was sited on a corner lot, and thus has only two sides, this building, surrounded on all four sides by streets, is a free-standing structure. This introduced a problem new in Renaissance architecture, which, given the newly felt desire for internal symmetry of planning symmetry: how to integrate the cross-axis. The ground plan of Palazzo Strozzi is rigorously symmetrical on its two axes, with clearly differentiated scales of its principal rooms.Amanda Lillie, Florentine Villas in the Fifteenth Century: An Architectural and Social History (Cambridge University Press) 2005:239 and fig. 195. The square The palazzo has mullioned paired windows (bifore); the radiating voussoirs of the arches increase in length as they rise to the keystone, a detail that was much copied for arched windows set in rustication in the Renaissance revival. Its dominating cornice is typical of the Florentine palaces of the time. The palace was left incomplete by Simone del Pollaiolo (il Cronaca), who was in charge of the construction of the palace until 1504. Also by Cronaca is the cortile or central courtyard surrounded by an arcade, inspired by Michelozzo. The famous wrought-iron lanterns that decorate the corners of the palace exterior, are by an iron-worker named Caparra. The palazzo remained the seat of the Strozzi family until 1937. Great changes were made to the building when the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni occupied Palazzo Strozzi. The palazzo, granted by the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni to the Italian State in 1999, is now home to the Institute of Humanist Studies and to the Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi. The Gabinetto G.P. Viesseux and the Renaissance Studies Institute have both also occupied the building since 1940. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the now-annual antique show, founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959, fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events, such as \\"Cézanne in Florence. Two Collectors and the 1910 Exhibition of Impressionism\\". Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux, with the library and reading room.

It is a Title I school. It is located at 33 Ferndale Avenue in Heartland Village, Staten Island. Heartland Village is part of New Springville, Staten Island. The school was named after P.O. Rocco Laurie.  History  The school opened in 1975 and has served approximately 2000 students annually. It is named after NYPD Police Officer Rocco Laurie who was killed in line-of-duty in Manhattan, along with his partner Greg Foster. Both Laurie and Foster served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. Stanley Katzman was the school's first principal. After his retirement, Peter Maccelarri, a Vietnam War veteran, would administer the school for more than 10 years. There are 4 assistant principals (one from each floor), and the Principal's Office is on the first floor. After more than 20 years, the school was structured in a way where as each floor is divided by the foreign language the student chooses via a formal letter (typically, students are grouped in classes by the foreign language elective they choose). The school effectively began its ARISTA Junior High School honor services in 2003. Around the same time at the beginning of ARISTA, the famed Bulldog Statue would be built under the administration of Peter Maccelarri. Now, effective of 2018, the first-floor services all grades, the second services the 6th grade, the third services students of 7th grade, and the fourth floor services the 8th grade. Each floor has its own set of AP's, Deans and guidance counselors.IS 72 Rocco Laurie in Staten Island, NY  Education.com It originally started with equal separation, as in the grades were divided somewhat equally, among each of the floors. The school would then honor Police Officer Rafael Ramos, as he had worked in the school as security before his shift to being an active police officer. He, and his partner Wenjian Liu were killed on December 20, 2014, in Brooklyn through fatal blows through the head and upper body from a shooter. He will be always remembered. As of 2018, Jessica Jackson, former principal and teacher of P.S. 69 over Merrymount Street, now holds administration of the school, changing it from the times of Maccelarri's administration.  ARISTA Information  ARISTA, a program developed and administrated by Spanish teacher K. Majersky and associate M. Breslauer, is intended to honor those who are hard-working and academically prosperous through access to more trips than the common 8th grade student and through an initiation ceremony held normally in May or Early June.

Other presumed birth years are 1900, 1901, 1903, 1905, and 1907 – May 30, 1956) was a virtuoso American jazz musician and entertainer who became an internationally celebrated talent. She was known as \\"Little Louis\\" and \\"Queen of the Trumpet,\\" a nickname given to her by W.C. Handy. Biography Snow was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Her mother, Etta, was a Howard University- educated music teacher and her father, John, was a minister who was the leader of the Pickaninny Troubadours, a group mainly consisting of child performers. Raised on the road in a show-business family, where starting from the age of 5, she began performing with her father's group. By the time she was 15, she learned to play cello, bass, banjo, violin, mandolin, harp, accordion, clarinet, trumpet, and saxophone. She also sang and danced. Valaida Snow appeared in a Swedish advertisement when she toured Scandinavia. Her solo career began when she joined a popular revue called \\"Holiday in Dixieland,\\" after exiting an abusive marriage. She then held a residency at a Harlem cabaret, which helped lead her to be cast along Josephine Baker in the musical \\"In Bamville,\\" a follow-up to the enduring hit musical \\"Shuffle Along.\\" While the musical was itself not a hit, Baker and Snow both received positive reviews. After focusing on the trumpet, Snow quickly became so famous at the instrument that she was nicknamed \\"Little Louis\\" after Louis Armstrong, who called her the world's second best jazz trumpet player, besides himself. W. C. Handy, who is known as the Father of the Blues, gave her the nickname \\"Queen of the Trumpet.\\" Contemporary critics Krin Gabbard and Will Friedwald have commented on her approach to playing like Armstrong. Gabbard said she developed a \\"distinctly Armstrongian style\\" and Friedwald said she \\"mimicked\\" Armstrong. In a 1928 performance in Chicago at the Sunset Café, Snow played the trumpet, sang. Then seven pairs of shoes were placed in a row at the front of the stage, and she danced in each pair for one chorus. The dances and shoes to match were: soft-shoe, adagio shoes, tap shoes, Dutch clogs, Chinese straw sandals, Turkish slippers, and the last pair, Russian boots. \\"When Louis Armstrong saw the show one night, he continued clapping after others had stopped and remarked, 'Boy I never saw anything that great'.\\" Despite her talent, she had fewer opportunities to hold residencies as a bandleader at clubs in New York or Chicago, like many of her male peers. Instead, she predominantly toured, playing concerts throughout the US, Europe, and China. In 1926, she toured London and Paris with Lew Leslie's \\"Blackbirds\\" revue and then from 1926 to 1929, she toured with Jack Carter's Serenaders in Shanghai, Singapore, Calcutta, and Jakarta. Her most successful period was in the 1930s when she became the toast of London and Paris. Around this time she recorded her hit song \\"High Hat, Trumpet, and Rhythm\\". She performed in the Ethel Waters show Rhapsody in Black, in New York. In the mid-1930s she made films with her husband, Ananias Berry, of the Berry Brothers dancing troupe. After playing the Apollo Theater in New York City, she revisited Europe and the Far East for more shows and films. She was imprisoned in a Copenhagen jail during WWII when Nazi soldiers took over Denmark where she was touring. According to a jazz radio show that aired 10/28/2017, she said she was arrested in Europe, apparently going to jail for theft and illegal drugs. While later touring through Denmark in 1941, she said she was arrested by Nazis and probably kept at Vestre Fængsel, a Danish prison in Copenhagen that was run by the Nazis, before being released on a prisoner exchange in May 1942. It was rumored that her friendship with a Belgian police official helped her to board a ship carrying foreign diplomats. According to jazz historian Scott Yanow, \\"she never emotionally recovered from the experience\\". She married Earl Edwards. In the 1950s, she was unable to regain her former success. Valaida Snow died of a brain hemorrhage on May 30, 1956, in New York City, backstage during a performance at the Palace Theater.  Legacy  Many recordings of Snow performances still exist, including audio recordings and audiovisual recordings of her on stage or in films. According to musicology professor Dr. Tammy Kernodle, \\"The unfortunate thing about her legacy is that she wasn't recorded as much as many of her peers, but she was a greatly respected musician on the vaudeville circuit, and even amongst male jazz musicians themselves.\\" This quote was from a phone interview by Giovanni Russonello, who on February 22, 2020, published her belated obituary in The New York Times, as part of the Overlooked No More series. There are no commercial recordings of Snow as trumpeter made in the United States, all were recorded in Europe. Before her obituary was published, The New York Times wrote about her only once in a paragraph-long review about a 1949 Song Recital at New York's Town Hall. Dr. Kernodle also said that Snow's legacy is important as she helped \\"shift the context of jazz away from the early Dixieland style\\" and \\"she [was] important in terms of helping us gain an understanding of the spread of jazz to Europe, particularly after World War I.\\" On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Valaida Snow among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Her biography \\"High Hat, Trumpet and Rhythm: The Life and Music of Valaida Snow\\" was written by Mark Miller in 2007.

Biography Kuhn was born in New York City in 1877. Growing up near the Red Hook, Brooklyn docks in a working-class family, he was exposed to a range of rough, colorful waterfront experiences in his youth and, though he loved to draw, nothing in his background suggested a future career in art. Kuhn's first jobs were as a proprietor of a bicycle repair shop and as a professional bike racer. At fifteen, though, Walter Kuhn sold his first drawings to a magazine and began to sign his name “Walt.” In 1893, deciding that he would benefit from some formal training, he enrolled in art classes at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.Biographical information for this entry is taken from Philip Rhys Adams. In 1899, Kuhn set out for California with sixty dollars in his pocket. Upon his arrival in San Francisco, he became an illustrator for WASP Magazine. It was at this time that he decided, if wanted to grow and eventually make a living as an artist, he should expose himself to the Old Masters and the modern artists of Europe. In 1901, at the age of twenty-four, Kuhn left for Paris. There he studied briefly art at the Académie Colarossi before leaving to the Royal Academy in Munich. Once in the capital of Bavaria, he studied under Heinrich von Zügel, a member of the Barbizon School. He went on sketching trips in the Netherlands and toured the museums of Venice. During his two-year stay abroad, Kuhn also saw for the first time the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists.Adams, pp. 14-15. In 1903, he returned to New York and was employed as an illustrator for local journals. In 1905, he held his first exhibition at the Salmagundi Club, establishing himself as both a cartoonist and a serious painter. In this same year, he completed his first illustrations for Life magazine. In 1909-10, his strip \\"Whisk\\" ran for almost two years in the New York World. He counted a number of cartoonists and illustrators among his friends, including Gus Mager and Pop Hart.Suiter, Tad. \\"The Cartoonist as Artist, part 4. The Leisurely Historian website. He also created a text comic himself: Whisk (1909-1911). https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kuhn_walt.htm When the New York School of Art moved to Fort Lee, New Jersey in the summer of 1908, Kuhn joined the faculty. However, he disliked his experience with the school, and at the end of the school year, he returned to New York. There, he married Vera Spier. Soon after, a daughter, Brenda Kuhn, was born. An important friendship was formed at this time with artist Arthur Bowen Davies, who would also play a significant role in American art history.Adams, p. 30. The relationship between Kuhn and Davies is chronicled in Bennard B. Perlman, The Lives, Loves, and Art of Arthur B. Davies (Albany: State University Press of New York, 1998). In 1909, Kuhn had his first solo exhibition in New York. In the following years, he took part in founding the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, the organization ultimately responsible for the Armory Show. Kuhn acted as the executive secretary and was delegated as one of the men to find European artists to participate. He, Davies, and artist Walter Pach made a whirlwind tour of Europe in 1912 to find the best and most audacious examples of new art to introduce to New York audiences. The Armory Show of 1913, which displayed both European and American modernist art, resulted in both an historic controversy and a long-range triumph. Smart and sensational publicity, combined with strategic word-of-mouth, resulted in attendance figures of over 200,000 and over $44,000 in sales, far exceeding anyone's expectations for the venture.McShea, Megan, A Finding Aid to the Walt Kuhn Family Papers and Armory Show Records, 1859-1978 (bulk 1900-1949). Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. After its New York venue, the Armory Show toured, receiving widespread attention, in Chicago and Boston. \\"Kuhn had a talent for promotion,\\" art critic Robert Hughes has noted.Robert Hughes, American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America (New York: Knopf, 1997), p. 354. This unprecedented exhibition had demonstrated that Americans might be receptive to modern art and that there was a large potential market for it; Kuhn played a major role in a transformative cultural event.Kuhn's essay \\"The History of the Armory Show\\" is reprinted in Arts Magazine (Summer 1984), pp. 138-141. The definitive account of the Armory Show remains art historian Milton Brown's study of the show's inception, organization, and reception. Following the Armory Show, Kuhn acted as an art advisor to the lawyer and collector John Quinn and assisted in the formation of his unique collection of modern art, unfortunately dissolved and sold at the time of Quinn's death in 1924.The relationship between Kuhn and Quinn, one of the great connoisseurs of his time, is chronicled extensively in B.L. Reid, The Man from New York: John Quinn and His Friends (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968). He also exhibited with the Whitney Studio Club and became a much-appreciated artist at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Kuhn's work in the 1910s often showed the influence of the modern European painters whose art he had helped to promote. The Polo Ground (1914), for instance, contains strong echoes of Raoul Dufy.Adams, p. 65. Other critics noted an affinity for André Derain and the German Expressionists. By the end of the decade, though, Kuhn's paintings had become more traditionally representational again, though he never worked in the manner of an academic realist; his portraits and still lifes are composed of broad painterly effects, strong colors, and thick textures. In brushstroke and intensity, a Kuhn face or still life is unmistakably Kuhn's. In 1925, Kuhn almost died from a duodenal ulcer. Following an arduous recovery, he became an instructor at the Art Students League of New York. He also completed a commission for the Union Pacific Railroad, the club car \\"The Little Nugget\\" LA-701, currently under restoration at the Travel Town Museum in Los Angeles, California. In 1933, the aging artist organized his first retrospective. During these years, he began to question his earlier allegiance to European Modernism. On a 1931 trip to Europe with Marie and W. Averell Harriman, his staunchest supporters, he declined to join the Harrimans on their visits to the studios of Picasso, Georges Braque, and Fernand Léger.Adams, p. 133. Yet neither did he want to align himself with the anti-Modernist camp of Regionalists like Thomas Hart Benton and politically-minded social realists. In the art politics of the day, Kuhn was caught between two extremes. By the 1940s, Kuhn’s behavior began to take on unsound characteristics. He became increasingly irascible and distant from old friends. When the Ringling Brothers Circus was in town, he attended night after night. (During a hard- pressed period in the 1920s, Kuhn had worked as a designer and director for revues and circus acts.) He also became frustrated by the lack of attention his own work was receiving and was particularly strident about the Museum of Modern Art's support of abstraction and neglect of American art in the postwar period.Kuhn is quoted on this subject in Time, November 22, 1948, p. 52. In 1948, he was institutionalized, and on July 13, 1949, he died suddenly from a perforated ulcer. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Work Walt Kuhn is best remembered today for his key role in planning the Armory Show. Ironically, a man who was in the forefront of the modern movement and was seen as an advocate of adventurous new art in 1913 came to be labelled, because of his on-going commitment to representation, a conservative artist by future generations of art historians.A critical but not unsympathetic account of Kuhn's art and its changes over the years can be found in Milton Brown, pp. 141-144. Brown writes: \\"Kuhn's Expressionism is conservative, but it has emotional depth.\\" Nevertheless, he holds a place in American art history as a skilled cartoonist, draughtsman, printmaker, sculptor and painter. Although he destroyed many of his early paintings, his works that remain today are powerful and are a part of most major American art collections. His portraits of circus and vaudeville entertainers are some of the most memorable, confidently painted works of twentieth-century American art. They are reminiscent of commedia dell'arte actor portraits done by the French masters centuries earlier. The Tragic Comedians (1916) in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and The White Clown (1929) in the collection of the National Gallery of Art are intense, arresting images and are among his most respected paintings.

The list gives the lengths of their respective episcopates, the corresponding consular dates, and the names of the reigning emperors. In many cases there are other details. \\"The collection of tracts of which this forms a part was edited (apparently by one Furius Dionysius Philocalus) in 354\\" (CE). It now survives only in a copy. The Liberian Catalogue is clearly the work of a compiler using earlier texts. It has been suggested that it is largely dependent on a work of Bishop Hippolytus of Portus (died 235), and is his lost Chronica. The character of the entries changes after Pontian. There are a number of \\"strange errors\\" (Edmundson 1913, lecture VIII) in the Liberian Catalogue, some of which may be the product merely of copyist errors (CE). The texts in the Chronography do display damage in transmission. Anomalies in the Liberian Catalogue George Edmundson pointed out a number of anomalies. \\"The deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul are stated to have taken place in A.D. 55 Clement succeeds Linus in A.D. 67, and Anencletus, the real successor of Linus, is duplicated and follows Clement, first at Cletus, then as Anacletus. Clement’s death is recorded as having occurred sixteen years before he became bishop according to the generally received date.\\" Nor were the errors confined to the first-century episcopates. The Hippolytean source is not even accurate about Pope Pius himself, who in the words of the Muratorian fragment lived \\"very recently in our own times\\". Hegesippus and Irenaeus, both of whom stayed some time in Rome soon after the death of Pius, both give the order of succession as Pius, Anicetus, Soter, Eleutherus. The Liberian Catalogue makes Pius the successor of Anicetus instead of the predecessor. \\"Depositio martyrum\\" and the \\"Depositio episcoporum\\" Two other lists are associated, in the sense that they occur in the same manuscript (the Chronographus anni 354). These are the Depositio martyrum and Depositio episcoporum. While these names could be generic, for lists of martyrs and bishops, scholarly usage without qualification tends to mean these lists.

History Founded in 1936, siblings Marino, Mario and Bruno started a small business in the basement of their home in Bologna, Italy, after learning the art of shoemaking from their grandfather. The trio began to accept contract work until the first Magli Shoe Factory (Calzaturificio Magli) was established later that same year. Shortly after World War Two in 1947, the company built their first manufacturing facility. In 1969, the company moved to a larger, more modern factory in Bologna. From the 1980s onwards, the Magli company opened over forty retail stores located throughout America, Australia, China and Europe. Acquisitions In 2001, the Luxembourg-based investment fund Opera, half-owned by Bulgari, acquired a controlling interest in Bruno Magli. In 2007 Opera sold the brand to UK private equity fund Fortelus Capital, and in 2014, the Swiss fund Da Vinci Invest acquired the brand. In January 2015, Marquee Brands announced its acquisition of the Bruno Magli brand and related intellectual property assets from Bruno Magli S.p.A.

After the Nationalists fled to Formosa (Taiwan) in 1949, Judd redoubled his support.Bruce Frohnen. ed. American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) pp. 459–60 Education and early career Judd was born in Rising City, Nebraska, the son of Mary Elizabeth (Greenslit) and Horace Hunter Judd. After training with the ROTC for the United States Army near the end of World War I, he earned his M.D. degree at the University of Nebraska in 1923. Next, he became the Traveling Secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement. From 1925 through 1931, Judd was a medical missionary in China, sent to assist Edward Bliss. He worked first in small clinic a backwater town, then became head of a large hospital in a sizable city. From 1931 to 1934 he worked at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Then, in 1934 he returned to China as a missionary physician until 1938, when he returned to Minnesota. Political career and US foreign policy positions Upon his return the United States, he did not urge Americans to be isolationists. Instead, Judd encouraged support of China against Japanese aggression. Elected to the U.S. Congress from Minnesota in 1942, where he became a powerful voice in support of China. He served for 20 years from 1943 until 1963 in the 78th, 79th, 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 86th, and 87th congresses. Judd voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Judd was known for his eloquent oratory and expertise in U.S. foreign policy. He spoke at civic and political gatherings around the nation. He was a good friend of Senator Harry S Truman, and together they spent two weeks in 1943 making speeches in support of the United Nations, doubling up in hotel rooms at night. In Congress, Judd supported liberal international program such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. He called for removal of ethnic and racial restrictions in the immigration laws. He was an outspoken anti- communist and critic of U.S. rapprochement with China at the expense of the Republic of China on Taiwan. In the early 1950s, Judd helped organize the Committee of One Million, a citizens' group dedicated to keeping the People's Republic of China out of the United Nations. Edwards, 1990 Judd was a strong advocate of the foreign aid program, a position which brought him into sharp contrast with colleague Otto Passman, a Democrat from Monroe, Louisiana who chaired the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, which maintains jurisdiction over such programs. Passman explained his longstanding criticism of the program: \\"First, we cannot spend ourselves rich. Second, we cannot make ourselves secure by giving ourselves away. Third, we cannot buy friends. We were once told that foreign aid would stop communism. Now we are told it is our duty to buy our way of life for countries all over the world. But we cannot in fact improve their living standards by as much as 1 percent even if we should give away everything we own.\\"Billy Hathorn, \\"Otto Passman, Jerry Huckaby, and Frank Spooner: The Louisiana Fifth Congressional District Campaign of 1976\\", Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. LIV, No. 3 (Summer 2013), p. 335 Judd gave the keynote address at the 1960 Republican National Convention, which met in Chicago to nominate the Nixon-Lodge ticket. In 1962, Judd was defeated for reelection by liberal Democrat Donald M. Fraser. The District had been redrawn after the 1960 census, making it heavily Democratic.After Judd's defeat the District has been represented exclusively by Democrats: Donald M. Fraser (from 1963 to 1979), Martin Olav Sabo (from 1979 to 2007), and Keith Ellison (since 2007). Judd's defeat worked to increase Passman's power on the foreign aid subcommittee. He was the last person to attempt to run for president on a major party ticket to have been born in the 19th century, though he did not make it past the primaries. In 1964, Judd's name was placed in nomination at the Republican National Convention for President and he received a smattering of votes. According to biographer Yanli Gao: :Judd was both a Wilsonian moralist and a Jacksonian protectionist, whose efforts were driven by a general Christian understanding of human beings, as well as a missionary complex. As he appealed simultaneously to American national interests and a popular Christian moral conscience, the Judd experience demonstrated that determined courageous advocacy by missionaries did in fact help to shape an American foreign policy needing to be awakened from its isolationist slumbers.\\"Yanli Gao and Robert Osburn Jr. \\"Walter Judd and the Sino-Japanese War: Christian Missionary cum Foreign Policy Activist.\\" Journal of Church and State 58.4 (2016): 615-632. Presidential Medal of Freedom In 1981, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the nation's highest civilian award). Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he was actively involved in the Council Against Communist Aggression in Washington D.C.

Biography Wang Hui followed in the footprints of his great grandfathers, grandfather, father and uncles and learned painting at a very early age. He was later taught by two contemporary masters, Zhang Ke and Wang Shimin, who taught him to work in the tradition of copying famous Chinese paintings. This is most likely the reason why critics claim that his work is conservative and reflects the Yuan and Song traditions. One critic claimed that \\"his landscape paintings reflect his nostalgic attachment to classical Chinese aesthetics.\\" Along with the other Wangs, Wang Hui helped to perpetuate the tradition of copying the ancient masters rather than creating original work.

Vintage bottle shown. Bitter lemon is a bitter lemon flavoured soft drink. Its signature taste is a result of inherently bitter lemon pith being reinforced by the bitter alkaloid quinine. The principal difference between tonic water and bitter lemon is the lemon juice, pith, and peel. The juice adds sour, offset by additional sweetener, and the oily peel fragrance. Bitter lemon is drunk both by itself and as a mixer, and is sold across the world. The generic bitter lemon drink dates back to 1834. Schweppes introduced its brand of bitter lemon in 1957.
