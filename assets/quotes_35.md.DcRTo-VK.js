For this recording, they were joined by D√≥nal Lunny and Kevin Burke. It was produced by Lunny and recorded at Rockfield Studios in the autumn of 1976, and released in December 1976 by Mulligan Music Ltd. Recording Irvine opens the album with his arrangement of \\"Plains of Kildare\\": an instrumental intro in time (jig) leads into the song, which is in time for the first six verses until an elegant transition switches to an instrumental middle eight played in the Bulgarian rachenitsa rhythm of time (2‚Äì2‚Äì3) which aptly suggests the gallop of racing horses, then back in , as the horses slow down for the final verse prior to the finale, again in .Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine/Paul Brady LP, Mulligan LUN 008, 1976. Irvine adapted the lyrics based on earlier versions from Eddie Butcher and A.L. Lloyd, while also using additional sources supplied by Frank Harte.Sleeve notes from Live From Patrick Street, Green Linnet GLCD 1194, 1999. \\"Lough Erne Shore\\" is an Ulster love song that Brady learnt from Paddy Tunney, son of Brigid Tunney. On this recording, Irvine provides an ingenious accompaniment on hurdy-gurdy that implies the instrument's drones are capable of playing chords. Years later, Irvine explained: \\"I recorded three different drones on the hurdy-gurdy and we cross faded them on the mix to fit the chords. It's very subtle and you may not hear it but I thought it gave it a great feeling.\\"\\"Lough Erne Shore\\", from the album Andy Irvine/Paul Brady, 1976. Retrieved on 25 August 2013 \\"Fred Finn's Reel/Sailing into Walpole's Marsh\\" are two reels learnt from Deirdre Shannon (fiddle), Brian Bailey (flute) and Trevor Stewart (uilleann pipes), a trio from Northern Ireland. \\"Bonny Woodhall\\" is Irvine's interpretation of \\"Bonny Woodha (H476 in Sam Henry's Songs of the People), which he also set to new music. \\"Arthur McBride and the Sergeant\\" is Brady's version of the anti- recruiting song collected by P.W. Joyce 1840. \\"The Jolly Soldier\\", sung by Brady, is a modern variant of the old ballad of \\"Earl Brand\\", where a father and seven brothers are slain by the lover they are pursuing. In this version, the old man relents and gives the lover both his daughter and all of his money. It is followed by \\"The Blarney Pilgrim\\", a three-part jig out of the Cork/Kerry tradition, learnt from Paul Davis. \\"Autumn Gold\\" is a self-penned ballad by Irvine and the final song of a quartet written during his sojourn in Eastern Europe during 1968‚Äì69, after spending several months in Ljubljana. \\"Mary and the Soldier\\", sung by Brady, is the story of the soldier heading for the wars and leaving the girl behind. In this version of the song, also collected by Sam Henry under the title of \\"The Gallant Soldier\\" (H782 in Songs of the People), he is so impressed by her loyalty that he marries her before he goes away. \\"Streets of Derry\\", sung by Irvine, is yet another song from Sam Henry's collection (H705, \\"The Dreary Gallows\\"). It tells the story of a young gentleman who fell in love with a rich lady but her parents did not consent to their marriage and had him condemned to be hanged. But she defied her parents, obtained a pardon from the Queen and married him in the end. \\"Martinmas Time\\" is the story of \\"a troop of soldiers\\" extracting a solemn promise from a maid that she will come to their quarters and she, being true to her word, does so. But by cutting her hair and dressing as a man, she succeeds in cheating them while keeping her part of the bargain: she leaves a sign to show that she has been there and gallops home a maiden. It is sung by Irvine. The album closes with \\"The Little Stack of Wheat\\", a hornpipe Brady learnt from its recording by Michael Coleman under the title \\"The Stack of Barley\\".

The film is based on a story by Milford W. Howard, who both produced and starred in the feature. The film was distributed by Film Booking Offices of America, commonly referred to as FBO. The film is presumed lost. Synopsis Cast *Milford W. Howard ‚Äì Roger Chapman and Tom Sullivan *Derelys Perdue ‚Äì Margery Chapman *Cecil Holland ‚Äì Dr. Earl Godfrey *William Kenton ‚Äì Dr. Paul Burroughs *R.D. MacLean ‚Äì Governor of Alabama *Mrs. Milo Adams ‚Äì Shepherd woman *Rosa Melville ‚Äì Mrs. Jack Armstead *Fred Kelsey ‚Äì Mart Stoneman *George Reed ‚Äì Simon Background Milford W. Howard, who wrote and produced the film, was a United States Representative from Alabama from 1894 to 1898, before moving to California in 1918. While still in Alabama, Howard wrote If Christ Came to Congress (1894), an expos√© of corruption, published again in 1964, and The American Plutocracy (1895), a novel about \\"two classes of people...the excessively rich and the abject poor\\". According to the Cedar Rapids Tribune (April 6, 1923), the screenplay was due to be published as a novel following the picture's release. Howard returned to Alabama in 1923, and after the death of his first wife, he remarried and traveled to Europe where he interviewed Benito Mussolini of Italy. The interview altered his political philosophy, causing him to endorse fascism. Howard's last book published was Fascism: A Challenge to Democracy, in 1928. The Bishop of the Ozarks was the only film produced by the Cosmopolitan Film Company, not to be confused with Cosmopolitan Films or Cosmopolitan Productions. Copyright documents on file at the Library of Congress show the film was registered by the R-C (Robertson- Cole) Pictures Corporation, which has been suggested was the holding company of Cosmopolitan. Cecil Holland, who portrayed Dr. Godfrey, went on to become one of the earliest makeup-men in Hollywood. Holland's work in makeup can be seen in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), and The Wizard of Oz (1939). Holland would later head up the makeup department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and also authored the book, The Art of Make-up for Stage and Screen. Reviews and reception A review in Moving Picture World at the time said of the film, \\"mysticism has been resorted to in several instances. There is a spiritual seance, a persistent strain of mental telepathy and a definite instance in which the occult powers of evil are demonstrated\\". The Exhibitors Herald opined that the film was \\"an odd mixture of prison reform, second sight and crook reformation\\", and noted that Milford's acting was \\"stilted and unreal and at no time does it get over very forcibly\\". A review of the film in the 1923 Exhibitor's Trade Review said the feature was \\"an extremely entertaining picture...in spite of the fact that films which suggest a religious atmosphere are seldom viewed with favor by the average citizen in search of amusement...in the present instance there is no propaganda developed regarding any particular belief, no attempt at preaching, merely a thoroughly human story, shot through with trenchant dramatic punches and, if there is a moral to be traced, it is simply that it pays in the long run to do the right thing and keep your nerve intact\\".

Education, Research, and Other Professional Activities Singh obtained her BS and MS degrees (5 year integrated MSc.) in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India, in 1986 and 1988, respectively. She was at the top of her physics class at both the bachelor and masters level (five year integrated course) at IIT Kharagpur. She obtained her M.A. and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California Santa Barbara in 1993 conducting research in condensed matter theory. After her Ph.D., she was a postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign before moving to the University of Pittsburgh in 1995. = Areas of research = After moving to the University of Pittsburgh, Singh gradually transitioned to physics education research and has been conducting cutting-edge research to improve the learning of physics at all levels. She has pioneered research to improve learning of advanced physics and has conducted seminal research on improving student understanding of quantum mechanics. She has also been a leading researcher focusing on research on assessment of learning in the context of physics and in improving student learning in physics courses at all levels. She has played a key role in research on the role of intuition and expertise in physics problem solving, which can be translated to improving students‚Äô problem solving, reasoning and meta-cognitive skills. Her research includes both theoretical and empirical research to make students good problem solvers and independent learners. Singh‚Äôs research elucidates cognitive issues in learning physics, identifies sources of student difficulties in learning physics at both the introductory and advanced levels, and can be translated into the design and assessment of research-validated novel pedagogies that may significantly reduce these difficulties. =Other areas of research= In the past, Singh has conducted the following types of research in theoretical physics: * The effect of quenched disorder on the nonlinear optical properties of conducting polymers. * The electronic and conformational properties of conducting polymers in solution including the electronic energy gap, the density of states, the localization properties of the electronic states, the persistence and conjugation lengths, the optical absorption, and the distribution of bond angles and lengths using analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. * The role of fluctuations in self organizing critical systems using a singular diffusion approach. * The equilibrium thermodynamic properties of Diblock copolymers using the Landau-Ginzburg theory. * The range of validity of the asymptotic forms of correlation functions and susceptibilities in one dimensional Hubbard model and the cross-over as a function of temperature, between the half-filled and non-half-filled behavior at low doping, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. * Ion transport and selectivity of ions in the transmembrane ion channels using Molecular Dynamics simulations. * The phase behavior and thermodynamic properties of the polymer mixtures including the self-consistent determination of the chain conformation. * Pattern formation in thin polymeric films, adsorption of polymers at patterned surfaces, and formation of ion-channels in lipid membranes using self-consistent field theory. Singh‚Äôs Master‚Äôs project at IIT Kharagpur, India, involved preparing co-precipitated samples of superconducting YBCO and characterizing them using resistance measurements and scanning electron microscope measurements. =Other professional activities= Upon request from another alumnus from IIT, Singh recorded 130 half-hour lectures for the Topper Learning Channel. The physics lectures for 11th grade and 12th grade physics in India that she recorded focus on the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum, which is equivalent to college introductory calculus-based physics curriculum in the US. These lectures provide an extremely low cost alternative to expensive tutoring that many Indian parents cannot afford. These video lectures incorporate research in physics education and help students with the difficulties they commonly have in learning various topics in physics and they also include research-based learning tools to engage students in the learning process. The videos start with a teaser which includes a real world application of physics. The teasers in the video lectures involve a concrete application of physics relevant for the topic of the lecture (e.g., in one teaser, Singh would be biking fast and the bike would be stable but when she would slow down, the bike would wobble and she would ask students why the bike was less stable when she slowed down and then invite them to join her in the interactive video lecture which would help them learn about it). The rest of the video lecture takes advantage of physics demonstrations and visualization tools to help students learn. All videos end with the line ‚ÄúAnd remember, it‚Äôs your universe‚Ä¶know the rules!‚Äù Singh held the chair-line of the American Physical Society Forum on Education from 2009-2013 and was the Chair of the Editorial board of Physical Review Special Topics Physics Education Research (PR-STPER) from 2010-2013. She chaired the second conference on graduate education in physics in 2013 and was the co-organizer of the first conference on graduate education in physics in 2008. She has co-organized two physics education research conferences in 2006 and 2007 and was the co-chair of the 2010 Gordon Conference on Physics Research and Education. She co-chaired the first conference which brought together physicists, chemists and engineers from various engineering departments to discuss the future of materials science and engineering education in 2008. She is passionate about increasing the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in physics at all levels and has conducted several workshops on related issues. Personal life Chandralekha Singh is married to Jeremy Levy who is also a physicist and a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh. They were classmates in the Ph.D. program at the University of California Santa Barbara. They have two sons, Akash Levy and Ishan Levy who are undergraduates at Princeton University.

Graves designed many golf courses, including golf courses in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, British Columbia and Malaysia.  Early life and education  Robert Muir Graves was born on September 24, 1930 in Trenton, Michigan, United States. He was the son of Orin Nelson Graves (1901‚Äì1980) and Margaret J. Muir (1902‚Äì1987). He had two siblings, a brother and a sister. Graves studied at Michigan State University and graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a degree in landscape architecture. Serving in the United States Navy during the Korean War, and 22 years in the Naval Reserves, he achieved the rank of Commander. In 1952, while living in Berkeley, California, he married Maryalice \\"Mimi\\" Rowland (born 1933). Graves was a multi-faceted man whose interests included flying (both for business and pleasure), music, and a wide range of sports including golf, skiing and horseback riding.  Architecture  Graves began his career in 1955 as a landscape architect before transitioning into golf course architecture. His first project as a golf course architect was redesign of the Carmel Valley Country Club in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California and Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, California. He designed over 75 golf courses around the world, but his best- known work is located in the western United States. In 1972, he designed the Big Meadow course at Black Butte Ranch in Oregon. His Sea Ranch Golf Links was opened in the early 1970s, and recognized as a \\"natural\\" and \\"minimalist\\" piece of golf course architecture. Graves also designed Port Ludlow Golf Course and Canterwood Country Club in Washington state. One of his masterpieces, completed in 1978, was the Championship 18 Course at Buffalo Hill Golf Club in Kalispell, Montana. Graves became the President of the American Society of Golf Course Architects in 1974 and served until 1975. In 2002, Graves and his good friend Geoffrey Cornish published a book called Classic Golf Hole Design: Using the Greatest Holes as Inspiration for Modern Courses.

This was followed by a complete buyout in 2006 and merger of both Stevenson Leisure Wales and SMPR, the new organisation was named Stevenson Management and PR UK, later changed to Stevenson management after concerns the initialism SMPR was identical to the original initialism of the former name, Strategic Management and Public Relations. The organisation now continues to operate a number of small business across England. In 2012 the organisation entered a dramatic financial decline and was forced to withdraw shares in a number of its majority interests, including the newly founded SunTEc sustainable energy in which Stevenson Management UK had invested a considerable sum. In January 2015 the organisation announced they had received and accepted an offer of ¬£3.1 million from Ravenscroft Leisure Holdings involving a complete takeover of the company.

As stewards of cultural property, museums collect and preserve not only objects but the research and documentation connected to those objects, in order to more effectively care for them. Documenting cultural heritage is a collaborative effort. Essentially, registrars, collection managers, conservators, and curators all contribute to the task of recording and preserving information regarding collections. There are two main types of documentation museums are responsible for: records generated in the registration process‚Äîaccessions, loans, inventories, etc. and information regarding research on objects and their historical significance. Properly maintaining both types of documentation is vital to preserving cultural heritage.Reibel, D. (2008). Documentation. In Registration Methods for the Small Museum, 4th ed. Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press. Historical paper files History Computer databases have become essential to the documentation of cultural property Practices for recording information about museum collections began developing in the late eighteenth century. Early collection control systems evolved from library prototypes, borrowing the idea of a sequential numbering system and accession ledgers to connect objects and the information about those objects. In the mid 1900s, formal registration training programs began appearing, and standards for documenting cultural collections were established. It was not until the late 1990s when computers became commonplace that any other major breakthroughs occurred in the documentation and object tracking methods of museums.Buck, Rebecca A. (2010). History of Registration. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 2-11). Washington, DC: AAM Press. Types of documentation A comprehensive object file contains many different types of documentation, following the object through its life cycle. Some of the various events or facets of an object's life that require documentation are listed below:Longstreth-Brown, Kittu & R.A. Buck. (2010). Types of Files. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 150-154). Washington, DC: AAM Press. =Accessions= Acquiring objects, whether temporarily for loan or consideration or permanently for the collection, requires a great deal of documentation. Once an institution accepts responsibility for the care of an object, certain legal obligations are imposed: the item must be properly stored, maintained, conserved, and made available for the benefit of the public.Malaro, Marie C. (2012). The Acquisition of Objects--Accessioning. A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections, (pp. 57-113). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press. Documenting activities pertaining to the stewardship of cultural property can be helpful in recording and assessing the fulfillment of these obligations. Before an object even arrives at an institution, the first piece of documentation produced is an Initial Custody Agreement. This document contains contact information for the owner/source of the object; intention for the outcome of this transaction‚Äîgift, loan, purchase, or bequest; responsibilities for insurance, packing, and shipping; and a description of the object.Buck, Rebecca A. (2010). Initial Custody and Documentation. In R.A. Buck and J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 38-43). Washington, DC: AAM Press. If the object is to be formally accessioned into the permanent collection, a Transfer of Title is also required upon the object's arrival. The documentation required for a transfer of title could be a Deed of Gift or a sale slip. As part of the standard accessioning process, condition reports are also created, numbers are assigned and marked, and photographs can be taken. These initial documents are the beginning of the object's file. If supplementary documentation, such as Donor and Provenance Questionnaires and research files pertaining to the object's history or context/art historical significance are available, they can be included in the file as well. Documentation of the provenance of a work of art has long been a valuable component of art historical research. In addition to providing insight into the history of art collecting, it can serve as a way to authenticate an object and determine conservation priorities.Daly, Karen D. (2010). Provenance Research in Museum Collections. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 62-77). Washington, DC: AAM Press. =Inventories= The creation and maintenance of a reliable, accurate, and up-to-date inventory is critical to any collecting institution. Institutions document their collections in order to preserve them and make them accessible to the public. Inventories support the responsible stewardship and preservation of cultural property by identifying objects that require conservation, identifying objects that may require improved storage conditions in order to prevent or mitigate deterioration, documenting the location and movement history of an object for security purposes, documenting the collection in the event of a catastrophic loss, enabling and inviting research on the collection, identifying poorly or undocumented objects so that they may be better researched and documented, identifying missing objects so that appropriate action may commence, and facilitating day-to-day management of the collection.McCormick, Maureen. (2010). Inventory. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 300-306). Washington, DC: AAM Press. Because inventories can require a sizable commitment of time and planning from staff, a complete, comprehensive inventory is usually conducted anywhere between every five to ten years. In between complete inventories, partial inventories and spot checks are conducted. =Loans and exhibitions= Other events in an object's life that require standard documentation procedures are loans‚Äîboth outgoing and incoming‚Äîand exhibitions. Before an object is approved for either loan or exhibition, a condition report is usually recorded to determine whether the object is fit for travel and display. Condition reports provide valuable information about an object's state of preservation at a particular moment in time. They can be conducted by both collections managers/registrars and conservators, and can be crucial in benchmarking the types and/or rate of deterioration and documenting an object's condition history in order to prepare for its care in the future. Condition reports document any obvious blemishes, instabilities, old repairs, and pre-existing conditions.Demeroukas, Marie. (2010). Condition Reporting. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp.223-232). Washington, DC: AAM Press. Some of the tools needed to conduct examinations and thoroughly document an object's condition are soft lead pencils, examination forms, a camera, a cloth tape measure, clean white cotton or nitrile gloves, padded muslin rolls and blocks, a flashlight, ultraviolet light, and magnification. When considering outgoing loans, institutions can also request a General Facility Report form to verify that the borrowing museum meets the lending institution's minimum standards of climate control and security. Once a loan is approved, a loan agreement is drafted, which is a binding legal document detailing the minimum requirements of care while the object is in the borrower's possession, packing and transportation arrangements, insurance requirements, guidelines for reproduction and credit, and any other special provisions agreed upon by both institutions. Additional documentation that can accompany travelling objects could also include specific packing instructions with diagrams and an itemized shipping receipt or bill of lading. Copies of all of these documents are stored in the exhibition files, as well as the object's permanent file. An exhibition file could also contain checklists, gallery layouts and lists of object locations, conservation records, computer reports, installation photographs, gallery climate and pest-monitoring records, purchase requisitions, and correspondence relating to the exhibition. =Conservation treatment= Before and after photographs of a conservation treatment, Bronze Hui sculpture Documenting conservation treatments is a crucial part of managing collections. There is documentation required pre-treatment, e.g., proposals and examination results; documentation required post-treatment--reports ; and photographs, which visually document the process before, during, and after treatment. In order to determine the conservation priorities and ideal state of an object, the conservator first consults historical/cultural research and conducts and documents a physical examination of the object. Physical examinations can be useful in understanding materials composition and causes of deterioration, and when properly documented, can provide a reference for future conservators. Proposals also document the justifications for the proposed course of action and treatment goals, using both physical and contextual rationale. Before any treatment begins, the object is thoroughly photographed to document the \\"before\\" state. Once the initial stages of the treatment and cleaning have commenced, more photographs are taken to document the \\"actual state\\" of the object, free of compensations and old varnishes. During treatment, conservators also document the materials they used, reactions that occurred, information on reversibility, etc. Much of this information can also be summarized in a laboratory master report, which records information that may not be included in final reports, such as reasoning for methods, factors that determine choice of treatment and changes in methodology, material safety data sheets, etc.Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010). Documentation and Treatment. In Conservation Treatment Methodology, (pp. 379-417). CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. Final reports can contain this information as well but in less technical detail. A final report consists of \\"after\\" photographs, a summary of the work completed compared to the goals of treatment, and the conservator's contact information in case future conservators working on the object have questions about the previous work completed. Any documentation of conservation treatments is also stored in the object's permanent file for ease of accessibility and retrievability. =Curatorial and art historical information= Documentation describing the art historical context and significance of an object is important to maintain for research purposes. Typically curators develop this research and catalog their notes in the object file. They often publish their results as well, in order to advance the field and bring new understanding or interpretations to various art historical subjects. Many collections professionals benefit from the creation and maintenance of well-organized art historical documentation and research files. Conservators use this documentation in determining an ideal state for their treatment goals based on artistic intent and historical value. Collections managers use contextual documentation to determine the best storage and handling methods for objects depending on historical use. And other curators and researchers use this information to develop exhibitions and to learn about aesthetic and cultural motives, as well as technical qualities of objects. =Risk management= Identifying the risks that an institution faces and documenting the policies and measures in place to mitigate those risks is an important aspect of collections stewardship. Having a comprehensive, written Emergency response plan and Integrated pest management program, improves the museum's ability to minimize overall risk to the collections. Institutions also transfer the assumption of potential risks through the use of Insurance. Museums document and track the amount of insurance coverage they carry on each collection and/or object, as well as any specific provisions or exclusions. Any associated documentation needed for insurance claims, such as valuations and appraisals can also be kept in the object file. Another facet of managing an institution's risks, involves diligently documenting and tracking the copyright status of each object in the collection. In order to avoid copyright infringement and costly legal problems, museum professionals develop standard processes for recording and updating copyright statuses of objects. =Deaccessions= When an institution decides to deaccession a cultural artifact, documentation discussing the process of consideration for this decision is required. The institution documents the value of the object, the reasons why it is no longer appropriate for the collection; namely: out of context, deteriorated beyond usefulness, duplicate of another object, etc., and how disposal of the artwork will be executed‚Äîprivate sale, auction, donation to another museum, etc.Morris, Martha & Antonia Moser. (2010). Deaccessioning. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore, Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (p. 100-108). Washington, DC: AAM Press. Written collecting and deaccession policies and procedures that clearly outline the collection priorities and acceptable rationale for deaccessions are also documented for the museum's records. This protects the museum from potential backlash when objects are removed from the collection.Malaro, Marie. (2012) The Disposal of Objects--Documentation Needed to Support Proposed Deaccessions. A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections, (pp. 248-272). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press. Documenting contemporary art Documenting contemporary art requires a non-traditional approach. As artists increasingly use more ephemeral materials, installations, and digital content to meet their creative needs, the approach to defining the parameters of these new works and how to document them has necessarily evolved. \\"Traditionally, the documentation of artwork has focused on materiality and issues of authenticity. Materials are undeniably important to the way we understand art. A working knowledge of and familiarity with various media will allow a registrar to forecast storage needs, foster collections care, and recommend exhibition guidelines...but the conceptual core remains the essence of the work. The new challenge is how to effectively document a conceptual work.\\"Schlemmer, Mark B. (2010). Documenting Contemporary Art. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 78-84). Washington, DC: AAM Press. New strategies for capturing the conceptual core of contemporary artworks include recording perceptions of the work itself, documenting artist questionnaires and interviews to gain insight into intent and philosophy, and recording videos of installation and de-installation processes. Cataloging standards Adhering to cataloging standards while creating and maintaining documentation is necessary for uniformity and accessibility. \\"Standards not only promote the recording of information consistently but are also fundamental to retrieving it efficiently. They promote data sharing, improve content management, and reduce redundant efforts. In time, the accumulation of consistently documented records across multiple repositories will increase access to content by maximizing research results. Ultimately, uniform documentation will promote the development of a body of cultural heritage information that will greatly enhance research and teaching in the arts and humanities.\\"Baca, M. et al. (2006). Cataloging Cultural Objects: A Guide to Describing Cultural Works and Their Images. Chicago, IL: American Library Association. Standards can dictate processes like numbering and measuring, as well as data entry methods like choosing which categories of information to include (metadata sets), which words to use (thesauri and authority lists), and how to format data content. =Numbering and marking= Numbering and marking an object (usually with the object's accession number) is part of the initial cataloging process, which also includes standard procedures for measuring, photographing, and examining the condition of objects. Marking an object with its accession number (or temporary number if the object will not become part of the permanent collection) is how the object is identified and linked to its documentation. In order to track museum collections, to differentiate between permanent, loan, and subsidiary collections, and to provide access to the documentation of objects in the collection, systematic numbering schemes are used and each unique number is marked or tagged on the objects and prominently noted on all documentation associated with the objects. There are many ways to mark objects with their numbers. Depending on the type of object and desired permanence of the mark, some of the preferred methods include: archival quality paper tags with pencil, barrier coat with ink or paint, adhered labels, labels sewn with cotton tape, Reemay, or Tyvek, pencil directly on object (recommended for paper and photographs mostly), and Bar codes/RFID technology. =Categories and authority lists= Another way of controlling collections information to promote accessibility is utilizing standard formats of required data elements and preferred terminology when describing and documenting works of art, architecture, and cultural artifacts, as well as their images.Harpring, Patricia. (2009) Cataloging Cultural Objects. Retrieved April 18, 2015. http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies.pdf There are numerous guides available for determining which descriptive information is necessary to an object file and how to format that information for ease of accessibility‚ÄîCategories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), etc. There are also a number of authority lists and thesauri available to documentation professionals, which can be very helpful in choosing preferred terminology in describing cultural objects. The Getty Research Institute has created comprehensive vocabularies, including The Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), The Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA), and The Union List of Artist Names (ULAN). Other valuable tools for professionals documenting cultural property are CAMEO and the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works' Lexicon Project, which are collaborative efforts designed to define and standardize terms used in the description of objects and materials used to conserve objects. Documentation management systems In order to effectively manage all the documentation required to care for collections, organized systems are necessary. In the early days of museum registration simple paper ledgers were used to track objects, and documentation was stored in file cabinets. Since computers became more commonplace however, practices have evolved and very technologically advanced systems now exist to manage all aspects of collection management in one place.Quigley, Suzanne & P. Sully. (2010). Computerized Systems. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 161-183). Washington, DC: AAM Press. =CMS= Implementation of a Collections Management System (CMS) is now customary in museums of all specialties and sizes. A CMS is a database that can track object locations, prepare exhibition lists, create forms (insurance, shipping, loan, etc.), and organize conservation, publication, exhibition, provenance and curatorial information in files on the computer. All the data and documentation that was previously stored in paper object files is now entered or scanned into the CMS. (Paper copies can still be kept for archival purposes.) A flexible and robust CMS is capable of safely and securely storing information about collections objects, while simultaneously enhancing the capacity to share and disseminate cultural information to vast audiences via the internet. =DAMS= Another system that is fundamental to controlling and preserving collections documentation is a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS). A DAMS is digital archive that can hold resources (images, audio, and text) as well as the metadata used to describe them. These systems make organization, identification, and retrieval of images and other files more efficient. DAMS are also easily integrated with CMSs, so that as information on the CMS is cataloged and updated, it automatically synchronizes with the DAMS. Preservation Creating good, well-organized records is a successful start, but preserving that documentation for the benefit of future generations is also paramount. Some methods of initiating long-term preservation of both digital and paper files are delineated below. Institutional Archive =Archives= Many institutions maintain archives of their important documents. Documentation pertaining to the institution itself, as well as collections documentation is stored in the institutional archive or the library. Sometimes paper copies of collections files are stored offsite for extra safety and security (and for space considerations). An archive of collections information can have its own collecting policy and arrangement, unrelated to the way documents are organized in the current collections files. It is up to the Archivist to decide how to preserve and organize this collection of documents. Storage requirements for the various types of files in an archive (paper records, photographic material, electronic media, magnetic tape, etc.) are critical to the long-term preservation of the materials. =Backup= Information in museum documentation is often duplicated in multiple locations, in order to protect against loss of data. Backups are performed on a regular schedule and stored in separate systems or locations. Data can be duplicated and stored automatically on the system server or copied to external media, such as magnetic tape, optical disks, external hard drives, etc. \\"For long-term backup, 'live storage' is the most reliable method. The data are continuously rewritten in multiple electronic or physical locations, ensuring that information is not degrading from the effects of time or the failure of one single piece of hardware.\\"Quigley, Suzanne & P. Sully. (2010). Computerized Systems. In R.A. Buck & J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition, (pp. 161-183). Washington, DC: AAM Press. =Data transfer= Another strategy for ensuring the long-term stability of digital files is to periodically migrate data from one form of media to another‚Äîusually from an outdated medium to a more current format. This process applies to both file formats and storage media. Simply transferring data from one medium to another, such as from a CD to DVD, without changing the format of the file, is also a form of preservation called Refreshing. Documentation of any file conversions or media transfers is stored in the records as well for historical reference.

Holmberg has written profusely on distance education in Swedish, German and English. He has been awarded honorary doctorates by Deakin University in Australia and the Open University in the United Kingdom. He is a member of the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund, an academy of sciences founded in 1792, is a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa, Sweden, as well as of the Order of the White Rose of Finland.  Education and career  Holmberg studied English, German, Romance Languages and Education at the University of Lund and later went on to earn his doctorate in 1956. Holmberg worked in the field of distance education at in Sweden for over 19 years. He held the position of Education Director from 1956 to 1965. In 1966 he was appointed was appointed Director General of Hermods Foundation up till his resignation in 1975. In 1976, Holmberg became Professor of Distance Education Methodology and Director of the Institute for Distance Education Research at the FernUniversit√§t in Hagen, Germany. During his tenure there Holmberg published several books and made contributions to scholarly journals and papers. Among his works is Theory and Practice of Distance Education, a second and revised edition of which was published by Routledge in 1990. In 1995 he became Planning President of the new Private FernFachhochschule Darmstadt (Distance Polytechnic, now ) in Darmstadt. After his retirement from the FernUniversit√§t, Holmberg continued contributing both to research and debate on distance education as an active practitioner in the field. In July 2003, Holmberg joined a project concerned with online teaching and learning initiated by Ulrich Bernath and Eugene Rubin. As a member of their team he contributed to the development of the Virtual Seminar for Professional Development in Distance Education, which was successfully conducted in 1997 and 1998 with participants from all over the world. This course became the recommended first core course in the online Master of Distance Education (MDE) program, which is jointly offered by the University of Maryland University College and the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg.  Research  Guided Didactic ConversationSewart, D., Keegan, and B. Holmberg (Eds.), Distance education: International perspectives (pp. 114-122). London: Croom Helm Holmberg is primarily known for his theory of personal communication between instructors and learners in distance education. He views distance education as the conversation-like interaction between the student on the one hand and the tutor/counselor of the supporting organization administering the study on the other. The central concepts of his theory are motivation; empathy; non-contiguous communication; learner autonomy and interpersonal communication. In Holmberg's way of describing how distance educators should communicate with students in order to ensure real learning. He uses the analogy of conversation to describe didactic conversation and derived seven postulates.Holmberg (1995). Theory and practice of distance education. New York, NY: Routhledge. Guided didactic communication includes: Simulated conversation (one-way, the presentation of materials) and Real conversation (two-way between tutor and student). Examples of simulated conversation include self-checking exercises, review questions w/ model answers, and inserted questions. In essence, Holmberg believes that by fostering empathy between learning and tutor parties through appropriate one- way and two-way interactions, learners will be motivated and encouraged to engage in their studies. He also holds a general assumption that \\"real learning is primarily an individual activity and is attained only through an internalizing process.\\" This assumption is one in which theory on distance education can be based. Thus, the goal of his theory is to support individualized learning.  Books and other publications  In his Distance Education in Essence publication as a researcher Holmberg, looked carefully into the character and applications of distance education, and presents a revised version of his much discussed overarching theory. Particular attention is paid to the innovatory character of distance education and the role of technology in today's practice. *Holmberg, B. (1960). On the methods of teaching by correspondence.

Biography His father was a Lutheran minister. He went to the public schools of his village, then attended the gymnasium in Gemersk√° H√¥rka.Brief biography @ Osobnosti. In 1836, he was enrolled at the evangelical seminary in Levoƒça. It was there that he first came in contact with the idea of Slovak independence, a cause which he enthusiastically embraced, earning himself the nickname \\"Slavomil\\". Due to political unrest, the Hungarian government closed the seminary in 1841, so he moved to Ke≈æmarok, where he studied law and began to paint as a hobby. J√°n Francisci with the Slovak Volunteers (1850) In 1843, he decided that he wanted to be an artist and entered the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. His teacher there was the German history painter, Christian Ruben who, at that time, was also the Academy's Director. His father died in 1844, cutting off his financial support, so he sought and obtained the patronage of a nobleman from Orava named Micha≈Ç Kub√≠n. In addition to painting, he studied lithography and made some illustrations for the botanical dictionary of Jan Svatopluk Presl. =Slovak nationalism= Shortly after, he joined the Slovak nationalist movement led by ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, organizing rallies and patriotic meetings during the Slovak Uprising. During that time, through their mutual interest in painting, he met and married the daughter of a local landowner. Woman with Bonnet In 1854, he and his family moved to Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, where he spent eleven years as a drawing teacher at the Lutheran girls' school, dabbled in photography and decorated curtains for amateur theater groups. In 1860, he resumed his patriotic activities and, the following year, participated in the constitutional convention at Martin. In 1863, he was one of the founding members of the Matica slovensk√°. Deeply in debt, he left Slovakia in 1865 and took his family to Bielsko-Bia≈Ça in Galicia. In 1876, he travelled to Italy, in search of his son ƒΩubor, who had deserted from the Austro-Hungarian Army. His cause of death was given as pneumonia. In 1955, an art gallery bearing his name was opened in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° and, three years later, a statue of him was dedicated in Bratislava. It was sculpted by Fra≈ào ≈†tefunko, who specialized in figures from the Slovak Uprising.Painting by Peter Michal Boh√∫≈à References Further reading * Vaclav Karel Vendl, Peter Boh√∫≈à, slovensk√Ω mal√≠≈ô, self-published, Pardubice, 1922. * Peter M.

The operation provides rail transportation services to mining companies operating in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Qu√©bec, Canada. Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines opened the Bloom Lake Mine, just west of Labrador City, Newfoundland. The Bloom Lake Railway was commissioned to transport iron ore from the mine to a connection with the Wabush Lake Railway. The Bloom Lake Railway was constructed between 2006-2010. All of the railway, except the first , are located in Labrador. The Wabush Lake Railway began acting as a middle man, taking the Bloom Lake Railway trains, and transporting them to Wabush Junction for the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway to transport to the Chemin de fer Arnaud. The Arnaud then takes the trains to the Consolidated Thompson's dock at Pointe-Noire, Quebec. Consolidated Thompson was purchased by Cliffs Natural Resources. In 2011, Genesee & Wyoming began control of all of these operations on behalf of Cliffs under the name Western Labrador Rail Services. These operations form an isolated railroad network, as it does not interchange with any other rail lines on the North American network. On April 11, 2016, Qu√©bec Iron Ore, Inc.

It was a mission from St Andrew's Church, Bordesley. It was enlarged between 1899 and 1900. The altarpiece is by S Meteyard dating from 1916 and the statue of St Oswald was carved by George Latham. Bidlake also provided a vicarage in Dora Road in the Arts and Crafts style. Part of the parish was taken in 1924 to form a new parish for St Gregory the Great's Church, Small Heath. On closure the church was converted into a preparatory school. The parish merged into St. Aidan's Church, Small Heath and was renamed as All Saints Organ The two manual pipe organ by William Hill of 1846 was moved here from St Peter's Church, Handsworth. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

It may perhaps have been a gift to a Sicilian king from the western Greeks, as they migrated from the Greek mainland to the fringes of their new empire. Description The Sant'Angelo Muxaro Patera is a shallow gold bowl decorated with six identical striding bulls in relief. The long-horned bulls have angular bodies with prominent ribs and large cloven hooves. The bowl would originally have had a precious stone inserted in the centre that has long since disappeared. To one side of the central medallion can be seen a dotted crescent moon. The decoration of the bowl mixes Ancient Greek and Phoenician characteristics. References Further reading *L.

Gibbons is a practitioner and theorist in the field of Instructional Design and Technology. He has proposed an architectural theory of instructional designGibbons, A. S. & Rogers, P. C. (2009). The architecture of instructional theory. In C. M. Reigeluth & A. Carr-Chellman (Eds.), Instructional-design theories and models, Volume III. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.Gibbons, A. S. (2014). An architectural approach to instructional design. New York: Routledge. influenced by the structural principles of artifact modularization drawn from a number of design disciplines, as exemplified by the work of Baldwin and Clark.Baldwin and Clark (2000), Design Rules: The Power of Modularity. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Gibbons' work departs from prior work in learning design, which has historically been based on identification of design processes. Architectural design concentrates on the abstract inner architecture of the entity being designed. This architectural approach purports to make possible more nuanced and innovative designs. An architectural approach is considered by Gibbons to be essential in the design of adaptive learning experiences, including both those delivered by automated systems and those delivered by live teachers or a combination of live and automated means. In another departure from the standard approach, rather than beginning with the assumption of a formal design process, the architectural approach assumes that the sequencing of design decisions should be controlled by recognition of the beginning constraints given with the design problem and then by the successive placement of additional constraints through design decision making.Gross, M., Ervin, M. Anderson, J., and Fleisher, A. (1987). Designing with constraints. In Y. E. Kalay (Ed.), Computability of design. New York: John Wiley & Sons. Gibbons' philosophy of design emphasizes functional rather than physical characteristics of the entity under design. This architectural theory of design identifies at least seven functional areas of designed learning artifacts, including but not limited to: provision of content, execution of strategy, formation of messages, creation of representations, provision of user controls, data management, and execution of media logic. Design oscillates between functional area design and whole-design integration. The seven functional areas are termed \\"layers\\", a term borrowed from Stewart Brand in his description of the functional areas of a building's design.Brand, S. (1994). How buildings learn: What happens after they're built. New York: Viking Press. Layers define functional modules whose design can be approached semi-independently in the same manner as the functional modules of computers or other complex systems. Modular design assumes the involvement of specialists such as artists, writers, and design psychologists early, in the creative phases of design. The revision and expansion of designs becomes less disruptive because foundational interests and decisions are separated from the less foundational, the ornamental, and the derivative ones. Education In 1969 Gibbons earned a B.A. in English with a Chemistry minor from Brigham Young University. In 1974 he completed a doctorate in Instructional Psychology at Brigham Young University.Andrew S. Gibbons. (n.d.). Retrieved from During that time, he worked on the research team of M. David Merrill, assisting in the conception of Component Display Theory.Merrill, M. D. (1983). Component Display Theory. In C. M. Reigeluth (Ed). Instructional-design theories and models: An overview of their current status, pp.279-333. Hillsdael, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Component Display Theory provided the basis later for Merrill's Instructional Transaction Theory.Merrill, M. D. (1996). Instructional Transactional Theory: An Instructional Design Model based on Knowledge Objects. Educational Technology. 36 (3): 30‚Äì37. Academic career Gibbons accumulated eighteen years of practical design experience as a project director and consultant for two start-up instructional design consultancies: Courseware Incorporated, and WICAT Systems (World Institute for Computer-Aided Instruction). The idea of computer-based instruction did not exist in the thinking of the business and educational leaders in 1974, though research was conducted in high-tech laboratories as early as the 1950s,Atkinson, R. & Wilson, H. (1969). Computer-Assisted Instruction: A Book of Readings. New York: Academic Press. but cost and technology factors prohibited widespread dissemination. The opportunity for creating large-scale new-technology-based designs for a variety of training clients provided Gibbons many insights into the issues of creating instructional experiences efficiently that were also effective. In 1993 Gibbons transitioned to a teaching and research position at the Department of Instructional Technology of Utah State University, associating himself once more with M. David Merrill's ID2 research team. From 1993 to 2003 the conceptual basis for an architecture-oriented design theory grew, resulting in the publication of a book that began to show architectural themes that would evolve into the architectural design theory.Gibbons, A. S. & Fairweather, P. G. (1998). Computer-based instruction: Design and development. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Educational Technology Publications. In 2003, Gibbons became the department chair at Brigham Young University for the Department of Instructional Psychology and Technology in the David O. McKay School of Education.Biographical page for Professor Andrew S. Gibbons http://education.byu.edu/directory/view/andrew-gibbons During this time, the architectural design theory took its published form in a series of articles and a book.Gibbons, A. S. & Rogers, P. C. (2009). The Architecture of Instructional Theory. In C. M. Reigeluth & A. Carr-Chellman (Eds.), Instructional-design theories and models, Volume III.

New York: Routledge. Professor Emeritus status was awarded in 2016. Gibbons continues to remain active in researching and writing on architectural design theory. Research and books Gibbons' architectural design theory unifies what otherwise would appear to be separate threads of his work on design theory. The question had to be addressed early whether \\"theory\\" was an appropriate term to use referring to a system of design thinking. Gibbons supported his position that it was, citing the description of a uniquely design-related type of theory by Herbert Simon in Sciences of the Artificial.Simon, H. A. (199). Sciences of the Artificial, 3rd Edition. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Gibbons addressed the issue in a paper titled Explore, Explain, DesignGibbons, A. S. & Bunderson, C. V. (2005). Explore, explain, design. In K. Kempf-Leonard (Ed.), Encyclopedia of social measurement. New York: Elsevier. with co-author C. Victor Bunderson. In this view, explanation, which is the goal of science, is carried out in search of theories about how things work, leading ideally toward a hypothesized, unifying theory of everything; in contrast, research on design processes and principles is carried out in search of theories of how things can be made to work. Vincenti,Vincenti, W. G. (1990). What Engineers Know and How They Know It. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Klir,Klir, G. (1969). An Approach to General Systems Theory. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. EdelsonEdelson, D. (2002). Design research: What we learn when we engage in design. Journal of the learning sciences, 11(1), 105-121. and others describe research in engineering (design) that can lead to design theory that is distinct from scientific theory in several ways. Overall, Gibbons' published work represents the gradual emergence of the architectural theory and then multiple attempts to demonstrate the viability of the theory by fleshing out details. His theory of model-centered instruction,Gibbons, A. S., Model-Centered Instruction. Journal of Structural Learning and Intelligent Systems. 14: 511-540, 2001. for example, separates two major concerns of instructional designers: content and strategy. The term content in this context refers to abstracted subject-matter and not media resources. Model- centered instruction proposes that the most appropriate form of content is a dynamic interactive model and that experiencing and exploring the model should be augmented by support of different types. This counters the common intuition that verbal and visual expressions of content are sufficient. Model-centering forces the designer to separate decisions about subject-matter from decisions about its expression (messaging and representation) and from the means of leading learners into interactions with it (strategic interaction). It also begs the question of the means (expression controls) by which the learner might carry out the interactions. Gibbons and his colleagues explored design considerations for simulations in the light of model-centering.Gibbons, A. S., Fairweather, P. G., Anderson, T. A., & Merrill, M. D. (1997). Simulation and computer-based instruction: A future view. In C. R. Dills and A. J. Romiszowski (Eds.) Instructional development paradigms. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Instructional Technology Publications. As the architectural theory emerged, this led to a description of how designers might use it as a tool to guide the production of simulation designs without relying on a process design model.Gibbons, A. S., McConkie, M., Seo, K. K., & Wiley, D. (2009), Theory for the design of instructional simulations and microworlds. In C. M. Reigeluth and A. Carr-Chellman (Eds.), Instructional-design theories and models, Volume III. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. In the early 1990s, the interests of large-scale training distributors turned toward standard approaches for producing and distributing technology-involved instruction on a massive scale. A standard plan for product modularization was considered by them to be a solution. The question was, which dimensions to standardize. The U.S. Department of Defense funded the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, and a large number of commercial interests subscribed to the [IMS Global Learning Consortium]. Each major project created a unique product packaging standard, with its own centralized data collection and learner management functions. Both standards are widely used. Both modularization plans focus on software element interoperability rather than on design element interoperability. Both prescribe how products with disparate internal architectures can be placed into standardized software containers for distribution, in the same way that any standard DVD can be played on a standard DVD player. This was a production and distribution issue. Gibbons' responded to the modularization problem from the designer's point of view, taking into consideration the inner architecture of instructional experiences. He speculated that modularization based on the internal architecture of the artifact's instructional functions could lead to the creation of a pool of executive engine routines (applications) centered on the functions, rather than on the packaging of media products. Gibbons expects that future standards will evolve toward this new focus on artifact functionality, as the demand for more innovative and learner-responsive experiences increases, a view expressed in The Nature and Origin of Instructional Objects.Gibbons, A. S. (2000). The nature and origin of instructional objects. In D. Wiley (Ed.), The instructional use of learning objects. Bloomington, IN: Association for Educational Communications and Technology. (See also The interplay of learning objects and design architectures)Gibbons, A. S. (2006). The interplay of learning objects and design architectures. Educational Technology. 46(1), 18-21. In a different line of work, Gibbons and Langton conducted a two-year project to validate one of the claims of the architectural theory: the claim that for every functional design layer there are numerous theories from the literature of related design fields capable of informing design within that layer specifically. The control layer was selected for study, the layer within which the designer determines the kinds of expressive controls the learner will be given. An extensive literature review revealed a number of such theories that could improve the design of an interactive instructional control system.Gibbons, A. S. & Langton, M. B. (2016). The application of layer theory to design: The control layer. Journal of computing in higher education, 28(2), 97-135. This has encouraged further studies of additional layers. As the architectural theory emerged, Gibbons proposed that, in addition to bodies of theory, there exist a pools of design language terms related to different layers and that the expertise of a designer can be expressed in terms of the designer's familiarity with the languages of the different layers. Moreover, from these languages individual designers and group designers draw their preferred stock of design constructs. A study of design languages of dancers and their expression through notation was described by Waters and Gibbons,Waters, S. H. & Gibbons, A. S. (2004). Design languages, notation systems, and instructional technology: A case study.

S. (2003). What and How Do Designers Design: A Theory of Design Structure. Tech Trends, 47(5), 22-27. Rather than being static, it was shown that pools grow and contract as terms fall into and out of use through innovation and that, though terms may be shared among design team members, the ultimate range of an individual designer is set by the individual's knowledge of terms in the pools or the ability to invent new terms.Gibbons, A. S. & Brewer, E. K. (2005). Elementary principles of design languages and notation systems for instructional design. In J. M. Spector, C. Ohrazda, A. van Schaack & D.

Driscoll (Eds.), Handbook of research on educational communications and technology, 3rd ed.. New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 633-645. This led to a proposal that designer training should expose novice designers to the existence of these terminologies and their usefulness in generating innovative designs within teams. On the question of the comparison of theories, Gibbons and a team of collaborators studied a group of published instructional theories, seeking a basis for comparing them critically and in greater detail. This study revealed that theories had to be read in terms of the theorist's unwritten but implied conceptual categories, since theorists were found to use different terms when clearly referring to the same phenomena.Bostwick, J.

It replaced the Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Silver, Union of South Africa Queen's Medal for Bravery, Silver and Woltemade Decoration for Bravery, Silver, all of which ranked on par with each other and the award of which had been discontinued in 1952, 1961 and 1988 respectively.South African Medal Website - Republic of South Africa: 1967-2002 (Accessed 1 May 2015)South African Medal Website - Post-nominal Letters (Accessed 28 April 2015) Institution The Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Silver, post-nominal letters WDS, was instituted by Warrant of 16 September 1988, published in Government Gazette no. 11519 dated 30 September 1988. It is the lesser of two classes of South Africa's highest civilian decoration for bravery and it replaced the Woltemade Decoration for Bravery, Silver. The cross was named in memory of Wolraad Woltemade, an elderly servant of the Dutch East India Company, who gave his life while rescuing shipwrecked sailors in Table Bay on 1 June 1773. The ship De Jonge Thomas broke anchor in a gale force Northwestern and was driven ashore in the Salt River Mouth. Woltemade rode his horse into the sea seven times and brought surviving sailors ashore each time, but on the eighth excursion Woltemade and his exhausted horse were overladen by panic-stricken sailors and drowned. Award criteria The Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Silver could be awarded to South African citizens who have distinguished themselves by exceptional bravery, by placing their own lives in great danger whilst trying to save the life of another person, or by saving or protecting property belonging to the state, within or beyond the borders of the Republic of South Africa. The cross could also be awarded to non-citizens who have distinguished themselves in this manner, by placing their own lives in great danger whilst trying to save the life of a South Africa citizen, or by saving or protecting property belonging to the state, within or beyond the borders of the Republic of South Africa. Order of wear The position of the Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Silver in the official national order of precedence was revised three times after 1990 to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first with the integration process of 1994, again when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non-statutory para-military forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again with the institution of new sets of awards in 2002 and 2003, but it remained unchanged on all three occasions.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, * Preceded by the National Intelligence Service Cross for Valour, Gold (CV). * Succeeded by the King's/Queen's Police Medal for Gallantry or Distinguished Service (KPM/QPM).Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 Description The Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Silver is a breast decoration and consists of the cross, a silver rosette and, for evening dress, a miniature cross identical to the obverse design of the breast badge. The rosette would be worn on the left lapel of a jacket or as a brooch by ladies. When worn on uniform, the rosette would be attached to the ribbon bar. ;Obverse The Cross is struck in silver and is 38 millimetres in diameter. It is in the form of a cross potent facetted newy, with a centre roundel bearing, in relief, a representation of Wolraad Woltemade on his horse saving a man from the sea. ;Reverse The reverse of the full-size decoration has the embellished South African Coat of Arms and the engraved serial number of the cross. The reverse of the miniature decoration is smooth and impressed with a silver hallmark. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark blue with 4 millimetres wide orange edges. Since the same ribbon is used for the Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Gold, the silver rosette would be worn on the ribbon bar when ribbons alone are worn. ;Bar A bar, struck in silver and decorated with laurel leaves, could be awarded to denote a subsequent award. Recipients Altogether 39 decorations were awarded. The first recipient, in 1988, was Erasmus Hattingh. Discontinuation The Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Silver was discontinued in 2002 and was replaced by the Mendi Decoration for Bravery, Silver (OMBS) during the following year.

Career =Amateur career= Van Meirhaeghe at the 2014 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad U23. As a junior, Van Meirhaeghe won the 2010 Junior Tour of Flanders. After a year riding for the Soenens‚ÄìConstrukt Glas team, he rode for the Lotto-Belisol Under-23 team from 2012 to 2014. In February 2014, he finished on the podium of the under-23 edition of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, having been in a breakaway with the eventual race winner, Dimitri Claeys. In May 2014, he finished in the top ten of the Paris‚ÄìArras Tour, his best stage-race result to that point. During this time he rode principally as a domestique for other riders, rarely having a chance to race for himself. In August 2014, Van Meirhaeghe became the under-23 Belgian national road race champion, winning the race in a solo breakaway despite a gear-shift problem. Shortly after this victory, it was announced that Van Meirhaeghe was among six neo-professionals to sign for the Professional Continental cycling team for the 2015 season. =Professional career= His first race for the team came at the 2015 Tour of Qatar. He subsequently raced in the 2015 Tour of Oman. He joined the breakaway on the first stage in an attempt to gain the young rider's jersey but failed. He then entered the breakaway on every subsequent stage of the race and was awarded the combativity jersey at the end of the race. On the final stage of the race, Van Meirhaeghe was part of the breakaway group that stayed away to the end of the race. He was tired following his efforts earlier in the race and did not even need to enter the breakaway in order to win the combativity classification, but he was ultimately able to stay with the leading riders. In the final part of the stage, he was beaten by his companions Matthias Br√§ndle and Iljo Keisse; he took third place on the stage, which was the biggest result of his career to that point.

Local historians and the Swedish Social Democratic Party consider it the first political predecessor of the Swedish labour movement in the province of Bohusl√§n. Its purpose was to bring about universal suffrage in Sweden: At the time, suffrage in the country was restricted to men and based on personal wealth, therefore excluding most of the urban and rural working class from the electoral process. The Uddevalla Suffrage Association was one of many groups throughout Sweden that helped bring democratic thought into the common discourse and make way for the political breakthrough of the labour movement. History =Growth= Ture Malmgren, first chairman of the Association, ca. 1880s‚Äì1900. The foundation of the organization was preceded by an August 1890 election in Gothenburg of a three-person committee intended to foster the creation of regional and local suffrage associations. One of those elected was Ture Malmgren, the owner and editor of the daily newspaper Bohusl√§ningen. On 12 October 1890, the Uddevalla Suffrage Association was formed after a public meeting at the Lancaster School (Lancasterskolan) that was attended by 250 people, described as \\"mainly men from the manually labouring class\\". The Association's stated goal was \\"to gather supporters of the lowering or abolition of the political suffrage limit, and of the equalization of the municipal voting rights\\". Malmgren was elected as the Association's first chairman. Other board members were the foreman E. Fredborg as vice chairman, the store manager O. E. Gutke as secretary, the journalist Oskar Malmrot as vice secretary, and the teacher P. Larsson as treasurer. At a formal constituent meeting on 2 November, the membership was reported to exceed 200. Malmgren came to dominate the movement. In speeches, he railed against the graded scale of suffrage, which gave societal and political influence only to the wealthy. In July 1891, the Association organized its first large rally on Skansberget in central Uddevalla. Between 500 and 600 people attended, and speeches by Malmgren were accompanied by music and singing by the choir of the People's Associations (Folkf√∂reningarna). The same year, the Association joined western Sweden's Suffrage League (V√§stra Sveriges R√∂str√§ttsf√∂rbund). In 1893, several prominent members of the Association were elected as delegates to the first People's Riksdag (Folkriksdagen), a national meeting of liberal and socialist supporters of increased voting rights. Three delegates were chosen from Uddevalla: Malmgren, with 2,038 votes; the store owner Albert Andersson, with 1,434 votes; and the locomotive fireman G. A. Dahlqvist, with 615 votes. The debates at the People's Riksdag are said to have been intense, and Malmgren's newspaper stoked the flames. On 18 June 1893, the Association and other pro- democratic forces organized a large rally in central Uddevalla. By this point, Malmgren had resigned as chairman. His successor was Andersson. =Decline= In the late 1890s, the activities of the Uddevalla Suffrage Association declined as the divide between working-class reformists and more liberally- inclined bourgeoisie became larger. Several working-class activists became prominent in the Association, among them Adolf Bremer and M. A. Ljunggren, as the liberals withdrew. In 1898, the first formal Social Democratic Party branch (Uddevalla arbetarkommun) formed from the merger of several trade union branches, and the Association declined even further. With the decline and the increasing importance of working-class members, it also became more radical. Eventually, the group changed its name to the Uddevalla Suffrage and Discussion Association (Uddevalla R√∂str√§tts- och diskussionsf√∂rening), with the purpose of debating social issues. A prominent member of the Uddevalla branch of the Social Democratic Party, Johannes Hermansson, was assigned to write a new set of statutes for the Association's charter. This didn't happen, possibly because of the demands of the liberal faction. Instead, the Association was dissolved on 12 January 1902, after twelve years of existence. Most of its monetary assets were granted to the Social Democratic Party, which was seen as the ideologically closest movement to the Association. However, 100 crowns were given to the city's theatre association, because the Uddevalla Suffrage Association was one of many local movements that owned shares in the theatre.

Such systems potentially offer an alternative means of disposing of waste heat from plants that burn fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy.  History  Thomas Johann Seebeck (1780-1831) discovered the thermoelectric effect in 1821. The symmetrical Peltier effect (Jean Charles Athanse Peltier, 1785-1845) uses an electric current to produce temperature differences. In the middle part of the twentieth century the thermo-electric generator was often used in place of galvanic batteries.  Copper/ammonia  In 2014 researchers demonstrated a prototype system that uses copper electrodes and ammonia as the electrolyte. The device converted some 29 percent of the battery's chemical energy into electricity. The ammonia electrolyte is only used as an anolyte (electrolyte surrounding an anode) that reacts with the copper electrode as waste heat warms the ammonia, generating electricity. When the reaction uses up the ammonia or depletes the copper ions in the electrolyte near the cathode the reaction stops. Waste heat then is used to distill the ammonia from the used anolyte. The ammonia is then added to the cathode chamber. The battery's polarity reverses and the anode becomes the cathode and vice versa. The system's power density was some maximum power density of 60+-3 1 W m‚àí2(based on a single electrode), with a maximum energy density of 453 W h m‚àí3 (normalized to the electrolyte volume), substantially higher than that of other liquid-centered thermal-electrics. Power density increased with the number of batteries in the system. Volatilization of ammonia from the spent anolyte by heating (simulating distillation), and re-addition of this ammonia to the spent catholyte chamber with subsequent operation of this chamber as the anode (to regenerate copper on the other electrode), produced a maximum power density of 60 ¬± 3 W m‚àí2, with an average discharge energy efficiency of 29% (electrical energy captured versus chemical energy in the starting solutions). An acid added to the catholyte increased power 126 ¬± 5 W m‚àí2.  Telluride  Telluride based batteries convert 15 to 20 percent of heat to energy.

It was the second Catholic church to be built in Taunton after the Reformation, replacing the much smaller St George's Chapel. The main church building is designated by Historic England as a listed building, while the rectory is listed. The Catholic community in Taunton grew throughout the 19th century and within 40 years of the completion of St George's Chapel, it was considered too small. The Church of St George was built on land donated by the town's Franciscan Convent, with funding raised by the rector, Rev John Mitchell. It was opened in 1860, although building work continued over the following decades, and a rectory and school were both added to the site. The church was not consecrated until 1912. St George's was built during the Gothic Revival, and bears resemblance to the Somerset towers. It currently serves as one of two Catholic churches in Taunton, along with the Church of St Teresa's. History After the Reformation in the 16th century, Catholicism all but died in Taunton; an 1824 publication, The Protestant's Companion, noted that prior to the 19th century, \\"there were no Papists in Taunton\\". This was a slight exaggeration; in 1787 a Mission Rector was sent to Taunton, and four years later, when Catholic chapels were legalised, he registered a chapel in a house on Canon Street. A permanent church, St George's Chapel, was built around thirty years later, by which time it was estimated that there were around 120 Catholics in the town. The chapel could seat 200 people, and by the 1850s the Catholic population of Taunton had swelled to an extent that the chapel was no longer big enough for them. The nearby Franciscan Convent purchased a plot of land adjacent to their own in 1858, which they donated for the purpose of building a new church, rectory and school. The rector of Taunton at the time, Rev John Mitchell, had grand plans including \\"a spire to rival that of Salisbury.\\" In May 1858, an advertisement appeared in the Taunton Courier for a fund-raising bazaar and lottery for \\"building the tower and spire\\", though the lottery was banned by the police. The first stone was laid on 19 August 1858, by the Right Rev William Clifford, the Bishop of Clifton, and building commenced to a design by Benjamin Bucknall. The church was opened just under two years later on 24 April 1860, with William Vaughan, Bishop of Plymouth, leading the Mass, while Francis Amherst, Bishop of Northampton, and James Brown, Bishop of Shrewsbury gave sermons throughout the day. The rectory was completed shortly after the church, while the school was opened in 1870; lessons had previously been given in a room at the back of St George's Chapel. Work continued on the tower, and further funds were collected in 1875; the following year, one of the builders, George Toller, died after falling around from the scaffolding. The church was consecrated on 23 April 1912 by the Bishop of Clifton, who was assisted by 24 priests for the ceremony. A stained glass window was added to the west side of the church in June 1928, as a memorial to Canon James O'Shaughnessy who had served as rector of St George's from 1911 until his death in 1927. A few years later, a parish hall was built in the rectory garden. A second Catholic church was opened in Taunton in 1959; dedicated to Saint Teresa of Lisieux, it is located in the Priorswood area to the north of the town. The Taunton Catholic Church website estimated that there were around 5,000 Catholics in Taunton in 2010. The current rector of St George's is Monsignor Canon Bernard Massey, V.G., who is supported by Father David Savoury and a permanent deacon. Architecture The church is built of red Monkton stone, with Bath stone ashlar dressings in an early 14th-century Gothic fashion. Nikolaus Pevsner described it as being a \\"competent imitation\\" of a Somerset tower, although he notes that the detailing is more flowing than the typical Perpendicular Gothic style of the Somerset towers. The original design by Bucknall featured an tall tower, topped by a spire which ascended a further , but the spire was never built. The main entrance to the church is a set of large doors on the tower, facing out onto Billet Street. The cost of the building was estimated at ¬£6,000. The church features a clerestoried nave typical of Gothic churches, and the windows are predominantly of the Decorated Gothic style. The chancel is flanked by two side chapels, which are at the ends of aisles. The church is designated by Historic England as a Grade II* listed building, and forms a group with the rectory, which is Grade II listed. The rectory is attached to the south-west end of the church, and is of a \\"late medieval or Tudor style\\". It is a two-storey building of white brick with ashlar dressings. There is a two-storey porch with diagonal buttresses and a large entrance arch. The roof is steep, with patterned slate tiles.

Eugen Haile (February 21, 1873 ‚Äì August 14, 1933) was a German-American composer, singer, and accompanist, primarily known for his songs.\\"Haile, Eugen.\\" Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians. 8th ed.

K. \\"Happy Ending proves beginning of career: Eugen Haile, composer, at last gains the recognition for which he has been striving for many long years.\\" New York [?] [unreadable]. 8/10/1916. During his childhood Haile liked the zither, and also played the flute, which he learned from \\"an old town musician ... The boy preferred to play by ear and in the open; or to improvise an obbligato to the deep bass of an old shoemaker friend whose singing of chorals he enjoyed.\\" He loved \\"emotional spontenaity\\" and folksong, and had a \\"preference for simple sentiments simply and sincerely expressed\\". In 1887, at age 14, he went to study at the Stuttgart Conservatory, where he learned violin, piano, and composition. Haile spent seven years there, until 1894. =Career and marriage= During the next few years, Haile composed songs that he said were popular with audiences, but not with the musical authorities. Also, while in Stuttgart, Haile began work on an opera called Harald der Geiger. The librettist was a friend, who entered the priesthood and moved to America before the text was finished. Haile eventually followed him in 1903, settling in Scranton, Pennsylvania for a few years. While there, Haile conducted male singing societies, sent for his fiancee, Elise,\\"German folksong recital.\\" Musical America (New York), 12/16/1911. and got married. His wife was a contralto, who was also from Germany, and had worked in Stuttgart.\\"Eugen Haile, pianist-composer.\\" The Musical Courier (New York). 12/27/1911. Elise Haile, wife of composer Eugen Haile, from an article in The Musical Courier, 1912 Around 1905, Haile began work on a second opera, called Viola d'Amore. Its libretto was written by Baron Hans von Wolzogen (a \\"litterateur and musical critic,\\" and a friend of Wagner). In the first decade of the 20th century, the Hailes moved to New York City, living (at least at one time) on West 145th St.Haile, Eugen or Elise. Blank envelope with return address, c.1905-c.1930. From New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Eugen Haile Papers. They became active in the musical life of the city. In November, 1907, the singer Theodore Van Yorx gave a recital of Haile's songs at Mendelssohn Hall in New York City, accompanied by the composer at the piano. The program consisted of readings by Van Yorx from Haile's autobiography, interspersed with songs.\\"Van Yorx sings Haile's songs.\\" Musical America (New York), Nov. 23, 1907. Van Yorx frequently performed Haile's songs. The reviewer of the November 1907 concert said, \\"Van Yorx has sung these songs in over a dozen cities in the country\\".\\"[?] to sing Haile's songs: Theodore Van Yorx to introduce young composer's work.\\" Musical America (New York). Nov. 7, 1907. Singer Ludwig Hess also performed Haile's songs in the original German, in several recitals, singing \\"Teufelslied,\\" \\"Der fahrende Musikant,\\" and \\"Es vegnet\\". Haile was a baritone and frequent accompanist. Together with his wife, he also presented several concerts of his own songs in New York City. In 1911, Haile was getting nearer to completing his opera Viola d'Amore. Some time in early to mid 1911, Mrs. Haile went back to visit Germany. The opera received private hearings in \\"German musical circles;\\" and Max Schillings, the Music Director of the Royal Opera House at Stuttgart, promised to produce it when it was finished.Moderwell, H. K. \\"Giving music in the theater position of rightful dignity: Way open, contends Eugen Haile, for American composer to enlarge his audience a hundred times over in providing poetical plays with serious musical background - his own experience with a play of this nature - a field of broad possibilities.\\" Musical America(New York), Aug. 19, 1916. Many of Haile's songs were published in Germany shortly thereafter by Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag (see list of compositions, below). The Hailes spent mid to late 1911 at \\"Blythewood, Barrytown,\\" New York. Haile and his wife gave two recitals of his songs together on December 8 and 10, 1911, at Rumford Hall, New York City. Haile and his wife gave two more New York City recitals of his songs together on January 9 and January 29, 1912, also at Rumford Hall. Haile played all accompaniments.\\"The Haile's recital: A song composer and his wife in a programme of his own compositions.\\" New York Times. Jan. 30, 1912. In the January 9th recital, Haile seems to have introduced a new, more declamatory and more modern compositional style. A reviewer said, \\"The translation of the sentiment of the poems into tonal utterances is his aim ... To the lover of melody, these songs offer little\\".\\"Recital of Haile songs.\\" The Musical Courier. 1/17/1912. (See \\"Compositional style and compositions\\" section for longer quote.) In the recital on January 29, they performed his latest more conservatively styled songs; the audience's favorite was \\"K√∂nig Elf\\". A reviewer from Musical America said that it \\"has great emotional power, especially the final picture of tragedy.\\" Another song, \\"Verrat\\", was described as having a \\"quaint melody\\".\\"Eugen Haile's compositions: second concert of original works advances interesting songs.\\" Musical America (New York). 2/3/1912. =Illness and later career= Some time in 1912 or early 1913, Haile became almost entirely paralyzed, and was forced to stop all composing. On May 2, 1913, singer Ludwig Hess gave a benefit concert for Haile, because he was \\"grevously ill.\\" Hess sang a group of six songs by Haile, and various works by other composers. Other performers included Sara Gurowitsch (cello), C√©cile Behrens (piano), and the Hess Soloists Ensemble.\\"A benefit for Eugen Haile: concert of chamber music given by Ludwig Hess in Aeolian Hall.\\" New York Times. 4/3/1913. A Eugen Haile Society was formed in New York in 1914 to organize further performances of his music, to work for the publication of Haile's recent compositions, and to raise funds to support him and his family. In 1915, a columnist wrote that Haile was paralyzed, and could not compose or teach, but could talk. He gave an interview to Amelia von Ende of Musical America. During their discussion, he said that contemporary music was too intellectual.Von Ende, Amelia. \\"Calls music back to its simple purity of past: Tonal art must retrace its steps, maintains Eugen Haile, to pass the dangerous climax now reached in its development - would restore unselfish creative joy to composer.\\" Musical America (New York). 1/9/1915. In 1916, while still unable to walk, Haile composed a musical setting to a play. He \\"dictated\\" the orchestral score in six months. The play was written by J. and L. du Rocher MacPherson, and directed by Arthur Hopkins. Entitled The Happy Ending, it was produced in New York City, at the Schubert Theatre.\\"The Happy Ending.\\" IBDB: Internet Broadway Database. Retrieved 4/5/2014 from: http://www.ibdb.com/show.php?id=4200 The show premiered on August 21, 1916. In the score, Haile combined spoken words with pitch inflections, in the manner of Sprechstimme. Happy Ending ran for about a month. An interviewer said: \\"This score might have been one of mere incidental music, but the composer saw in the imaginative and poetic quality of the text ... the music drama of his dreams\\". Haile composed it in his more declamatory, modern style, making free use of leitmotifs. The actors in the play presented Haile with a testimonial, inscribed on parchment, expressing their admiration for his work.\\"Actors honor Haile.\\" [Unknown newspaper] (New York), [Late 1916]. [Clipping in the Eugen Haile Papers collection at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts] There does not seem to be any evidence that Haile ever finished his opera Viola d'Amore. On May 8, 1917, another benefit concert was given for Haile. There were three singers and accompanists performing, some from the Metropolitan Opera: Marie Mattfeld and Mattfeld, Margarete Ober and Arthur Arndt, and Carl Braun and Richard Epstein. Many of Haile's songs were performed, including \\"Fitzebutze\\" (sung by Ms. Mattfeld), \\"Verlungene Weise\\" (sung by Braun), \\"Eidechs\\" (a comical song, also sung by Braun), and \\"Herbst.\\" The concert also featured some works for cello and piano, played by Leo Schultz and Epstein. Epstein also played some solo piano works.\\"Opera stars sing at Haile testimonial.\\" Musical America (New York). 5/17/1917. After the benefit, the National Society of Music published an article about Haile in their bulletin, that said, \\"Whatever may be Eugen Haile's ultimate place in music, one thing is certain: that he will always be recognized as one of the truly inspired melodists, a lineal descendent of the great lyricists, Schubert, Schumann, Franz and Brahms\\". Also shortly after the benefit, Haile gave another interview. The interviewer states that Haile was still bedridden, but could compose. The author describes Haile as a representative of the tradition of German lieder. In 1924, H. W. Gray Co. published a children's book by Haile, entitled A Riddle Book with Melodies.Haile, Eugen. A riddle book with melodies. New York: H. W. Gray Co., 1924. Retrieved from WorldCat on April, 2014, from: http://www.worldcat.org Haile lived to see an opera of his produced, Harold's Dream, performed in Woodstock, New York on June 30, 1933. It was performed on June 30, 1933, in the Romantic-style garden of the estate of and Mrs. Antonio Knauth of Kingston, New York.\\"The Dream prelude to a new opera.\\" Musical America (New York), July, 1933. The opera's plot is a fantasy, and was called \\"the Prelude to the romantic opera Harald\\", possibly indicating that it was related to his first, unfinished opera, Harald der Geiger. The libretto was by Otto Lauxman. The cast included Winifred Haile, dramatic soprano, an orchestra, and a chorus. The Music Director was J. Peter Knauth; the Choral director was Harry Elmendorf; the Concertmaster was Gerald Kunz; Otto Riccobono and Agnes Schleicher were the Choreographers and Dance Directors; the scenery was by Konrad Cramer; and Louis Staketee and Robert Briggs were the Lighting Directors. Haile died in Woodstock, New York.\\"Eugene Haile: composer of several operas and incidental music.\\" New York Times, 8/15/1933. Compositional style and compositions =Compositional style= A reviewer of the November 1907 concert of Haile's works described his compositional style thus: \\"That Haile has real poetic genius and a facility in writing tender, dainty and delightful little songs, full of melody and feeling, there is no doubt.\\" In 1912, Haile seems to have begun to present works in a more modern style. A reviewer from the Musical Courier said of Haile's January 9, 1912 concert: > [The songs on the program] disclosed a talent on the part of the composer of > a serious character, well developed and well defined, with a preponderance > of the solemn and grave, although in certain of the songs there is much > delicacy and considerable sentiment. Haile evidently is a student of basic > principles. He never descends to the commonplace or writes merely for the > sake of effect. The translation of the sentiment of the poems into tonal > utterance is his aim, and his music not only substantiates this deduction, > but his interpretations are also corroborative of it. To the unmusical, to > the lover of melody, these songs offer little, but to him who possesses > sufficient perspicacity to observe substratum things, there is a wealth of > beauty and art in these songs which can hardly fail of satisfaction or > enjoyment. Haile's 1916 musical setting of the play The Happy Ending followed this more contemporary strain in his writing, combining spoken words with pitch inflections, in the manner of Sprechstimme. A reviewer described Haile's setting of The Happy Ending, saying: > Mr Haile has taken hold of the text of The Happy Ending and worked with it > quite as seriously as though it were the libretto for an opera. He has by no > means limited himself to \\"incidental music\\" - to entr'actes, intermezzi, > songs and the like. Finding that much of the action and dialog was of a > poetic nature which demanded music, he composed a score which is intimately > interwoven with the play. He has used leitmotifs freely, and has developed > them in transformation and combination according to the demands of the play. > He regards his score as a form of music-drama with spoken text\\". Another interviewer said that The Happy Ending as \\"not a success as a play; but the music, a wonderfully limpid undercurrent of sound that accompanied the words, a continuous surge of beautiful, inspired melody, brought tears to the eyes of critics, and the audience turned to the box where the invalid composer lay and shouted its satisfaction, repeating the demonstration on the street when he was being carried to his cab\\". Haile did not leave the conservative style totally behind, however. A reviewer from The New York Times said, in an article about Haile's January 29, 1912 recital: > Mr Haile's songs are marked by simplicity and directness, without > affectation of \\"modern\\" feeling, where such an impulse did not come from the > composer. He is evidently much influenced by the element of German folksong, > and several of his compositions are happy in a deliberate and intentional > embodiment of that spirit ... Haile also has a fondness for songs with > descriptive or characteristic accompaniments [including the songs > \\"Teufelslied,\\" \\"Werkeluhr\\", and ... the ballad \\"K√∂nig Elf, [which is] \\"... a > rather elaborate attempt at the kind exemplified by Loewe's ballads ... > Haile's talent is modest and unpretentious, but it has individuality and a > personal note that are valuable and none too common qualities in music made > in the present day\\". Another reviewer of Haile's January 29 recital confirmed the conservatism of this program's songs. The selections were \\"free from affectation and the modern tendency to launch forth into dissonances and individual mannerisms ... At times there is an indication of the influence of the great composers, especially Chopin and Wagner\\".\\"Haile song recital.\\" Musical America (New York). 2/7/12. In an interview in 1915, Haile said that contemporary music was too intellectual. He described his own philosophy of music by quoting the idealistic French author Romain Rolland and holistic music educator Francois Dalcroze (sic, √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze?), sharing their philosophies, adapted to his own field of music. In this interview, Haile also compared his musical gift to the poetic talent of Verlaine (who wrote mostly in small formsVerlaine, Paul; Hall, G., tr. Poems of Paul Verlaine. Chicago: Stone & Kimball, 1895.), saying, \\"In his very limitation, he proves himself a master\\". =Compositions= Haile is best known for the approximately 200 songs that he wrote to German texts, about 65 of which were published, mostly in Germany, (copies are available in the Eugen Haile Papers collection at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts), and some also published in America. His other vocal works include several duets and works for male quartet (also in collection), three operas, Harald der Geiger (unfinished), Viola d'Amore (unfinished), and Harold's Dream (premiered June 30, 1933), and a musical setting for a play called The Happy Ending, produced in New York City in 1916. Haile also wrote two cantatas, one called Christabend, for mixed chorus, soprano and baritone soli, and piano, published privately in Ulm, c.1900,Haile, Eugen. Christabend: v. Doepkeme√øer f√ºr Gesang mit Klavierbegleitung.

It is part of the Ashridge Estate, owned by the National Trust, and the local planning authority is Dacorum Borough Council.Information board on the site It is listed in the Geological Conservation Review. The lowest layer is gravel dating to the beginning of the Pleistocene 2.6 million years ago. At this time the North Sea covered much of south-east England and the site was in an inter-tidal area, but since then the Chiltern Hills have risen 170 metres. Above this gravel layer is sand, and then another layer of gravel laid down some 20,000 years ago. This was the height of the last ice age, when the site was cold tundra like western Siberia today. According to Natural England the site is \\"controversial\\" as the new excavation shows gravel of possible marine origin rather than glacial till as previously believed. The size of the site is unclear. In April 2012 the Planning Inspectorate gave consent for the erection of fencing round the site to allow re-excavation of the site while protecting it against badger damage and protecting the public against accidentally falling into the deep pit. The size was given as 360 square metres (0.036 hectares). The excavation and erection of the fence were carried out shortly afterwards. However, the Natural England (NE) citation gives the area as 0.3 hectares and the NE map shows a larger area of 1.2 hectares. There is access to the site from Bullbeggars Lane. The surrounding area is wooded and covered in deep pits called locally 'dells. These are the remains of working to extract the gravel during World War One to make sandbags of use at the front.

It is in the Schlosspark surrounding the Schloss Gaibach on the H√ºgel des Sonnenbergs just off Staatsstra√üe 2271. History The column commemorates the Bavarian Constitution of 1818, in which Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria voluntarily limited his powers and shared them with elected representatives. It was built by count Franz Erwein von Sch√∂nborn-Wiesentheid, who had to give up all rights as prince due to German mediatisation in 1803 but still advocated the idea of a \\"magna charta Bavariae\\". He commissioned his friend Leo von Klenze as the column's architect, though his designs had to reworked several times. It has a triple pedestal and an observation deck at the top - its overall form is neoclassical and reminiscent of Trajan's Column in Rome. The foundation stone was laid on 26 May 1821, in the presence of Crown Prince Ludwig and several dignitaries from W√ºrzburg. After a service in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Gaibach, the party set off up the mountain. The ceremony is shown in an 1823 oil painting by Peter von Hess. Its dedication inscription reads \\"This monument [is dedicated to] the Constitution of Bavaria, her creator Max Joseph, her preserver Ludwig\\" It was inaugurated on 22 August 1828, with Ludwig (now king) one of the guests of honour. Several commemorative coins were struck to mark the event and the anniversary of the inauguration was marked annually until 1831, when Ludwig stopped his reform program from fear of the July Revolution in France. In 1832 supporters of German unification tried to have a meeting at the column on the anniversary of its inauguration in sympathy with the Hambach Festival and tried to put black- red-gold flags on it, but their ringleaders were arrested. The commemorations of the anniversary only resumed on the 150th anniversary of the constitution in 1968. Bibliography *Herbert Meyer: Die Konstitutionss√§ule und ihre Geschichte.

It is an uncommon species, endemic and restricted to a few areas in the south-west of Western Australia. It is similar to the other species of Calectasia and has only been recognised as a separate species since a review of the genus in 2001. Description Calectasia palustris is an undershrub with stilt roots 40-110 mm long but without a rhizome. It grows to a height of about 70 cm with many short side branches. Each leaf blade is 7-23 x 0.4-0.7 mm tapering to a short, sharp point on the end. The base of the petals (strictly tepals) form a tube 9.9-10.1 mm long, while the outer parts spread outwards to form a blue, papery star-like pattern fading to red with age. In the centre of the star are six yellow stamens forming a tube which does not turn orange-red with age. The thin style extends beyond the stamens. It is similar to the more common and widespread C. grandiflora except that it has stilt roots and no rhizome. It is also similar to C. obtusa except that there is a sharp point on the leaf tips, also possessed by most other members of the genus. Flowers appear from July to October. Taxonomy and naming Calectasia palustris is one of eleven species in the genus Calectasia. It was described as a new species in 2001 by K.W. Dixon and R.L. Barrett from a specimen collected south-west of Badgingarra. The specific epithet (palustris) is derived from the Latin palustria, \\"swampy\\", referring to the unusual habitat preference for this species.Archibald William Smith Distribution and habitat This species of tinsel lily is uncommon and found in only two, separate areas of the south-west of Western Australia 70 kilometres apart between Cervantes and Coorow. These are in the Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in seasonally inundated swamp and in grey sand. Conservation status Calectasia palustris is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian government department of parks and wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

Anthony dollar is a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when production was suspended due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Intended as a replacement for the larger Eisenhower dollar, the new smaller one-dollar coin went through testing of several shapes and compositions, but all were opposed by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round planchet with an eleven- sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar. The original design for the smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse, but organizations and individuals in Congress called for the coin to depict a real woman. Several proposals were submitted, and social reformer Susan B. Anthony was selected as the design subject. The reverse design of the Eisenhower dollar was retained, an engraving of the Apollo 11 mission insignia showing an eagle landing on the Moon. Both sides of the coin, as well as the rejected Liberty design, were created by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint. One and a half billion coins were struck in anticipation of considerable public demand, but the Anthony dollar was poorly received, in part because of confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter. Despite its poor reception, the coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems, depleting the surplus by the late 1990s. In 1997, Congress passed a law authorizing the mintage of a new gold-colored one-dollar coin depicting Sacagawea, but production could not begin quickly enough to meet demand. As a stopgap measure, until the new Sacagawea dollar coin could be issued, the Anthony dollar was struck again in 1999 after an eighteen-year hiatus; the series was retired the following year. Special coins for sale to collectors were struck in proof finish through the run of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.  Background  In the early 1960s, as the price of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were depleted of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics and the public who believed that the issuance of the coins was a waste of resources and influenced by special interests, and that they would be quickly removed from circulation. A total of 316,076 1964-D Peace dollars were struck before production was ordered suspended. The coins were melted soon afterwards. and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years. On May 12, 1969, the Joint Commission on the Coinage, a panel of 24 individuals organized by the 1965 Coinage Act, recommended resumption of dollar coin production following a study conducted by a Congressional task force. On October 1 and 3, 1969, a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives discussed the proposed legislation to authorize the coin, in a copper-nickel clad composition, with the same diameter of the former silver dollars. A provision was added requiring the coin to depict former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died earlier that year, on the obverse and a design \\"emblematic of the symbolic eagle of Apollo 11 landing on the moon\\" on the reverse. President Richard Nixon signed the bill into law on December 31, 1970. Both the obverse and reverse designs were created by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint. As with previous dollar coins, the new Eisenhower dollar proved unpopular with the public, and very few of the coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute conducted a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, and the size of the dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: > A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the > capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. > Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong > interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their > machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost- saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.  Design history  = Liberty design = The Mint began preparation for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and the coin had near unanimous support from the Mint and the vending machine industry, an influential lobby in the area of coin design and creation. In 1977, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of Liberty would be a suitable subject for the coin. Chief Engraver Gasparro was tasked with creating a design for the proposed coin. His obverse design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse depicted a soaring eagle. The bust was pictured along with a pole, atop which sat a Phrygian cap, a symbol used to represent freedom. Gasparro's Liberty design was based on a similar obverse that he created for a 1969 American Numismatic Association convention medal. The reverse, depicting an eagle flying above a mountain against the rising sun, was originally created by Gasparro in 1967 for a proposed commemorative half dollar. Describing the reverse design, Gasparro stated that it was meant to symbolize \\"a new day being born\\". The design was reviewed by the Commission of Fine Arts, and in an April 29, 1976, letter, Commission member J. Carter Brown praised the design: > I believe this would be a superb design for United States Coinage, rooted as > it is in a great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, > following Augustin Dupr√©'s Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga > and Yorktown (1777‚Äì1781). A bill to reduce the diameter of the dollar from to and the weight from 22.68 grams to 8.5 grams was introduced to the House of Representatives on May 1, 1978. The bill was introduced to the Senate on May 3, and the proposed weight was reduced from 8.5 grams to 8.1 grams. The Mint conducted experiments involving eight-, ten-, eleven- and thirteen-sided coins, but it was decided that the dollar would be round, as costly modifications would be required to update vending machinery to accept other shapes. Instead, the bill prescribed an eleven-sided inner border, which was intended to aid identification by sight and by feel for the visually handicapped. = Selection of Susan B. Anthony = Treasury officials officially recommended Gasparro's design, which they referred to as a \\"modernized version of the classic Liberty design\\". On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's William Proxmire introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty. On May 15, Representatives Mary Rose Oakar and Patricia Schroeder introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives. Anthony was also recommended by members of the National Organization for Women, the Congresswomen's Caucus, the National Women's Political Caucus and the League of Women Voters. In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to Walter E. Fauntroy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: > The League believes that the time has come, and is indeed long past, for the > likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of > U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness should be that of an > actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. > Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human dignity in this > nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored > through this measure. In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support. Gasparro began work on his Susan B. Anthony design in June 1978, before the legislation was authorized by Congress. He enlisted the help of a friend in conducting research on Anthony, which he felt was necessary before creating the design. He referenced approximately six different images while creating the portrait of Anthony, but it was based largely on just two. Gasparro created several different designs before receiving final approval. One of his portraits, depicting Anthony at age 28, was shown to Anthony's great-niece, Susan B. Anthony III, who rejected it on the grounds that it unnecessarily \\"prettified\\" her great-aunt, and she criticized another design depicting Anthony at age 84, which she believed made her appear too old. Gasparro made several alterations with the intent to depict her at age 50, at the peak of her influence as a social reformer, but no photographs of Anthony during that period are known to exist. He eventually received approval after modification, later stating his belief that he had accurately portrayed Anthony. Initially, Gasparro expected that Congress would retain his soaring eagle reverse design to accompany the Susan B. Anthony obverse. However, a late amendment introduced by Utah Senator Jake Garn altered the legislation to maintain the Apollo 11 design in use on the Eisenhower dollar reverse. The bill was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 10, 1978, and production of Eisenhower dollars ceased during that year. After he signed the bill into law, Carter issued a statement, saying in part that he was confident that \\"this act‚Äîand the new dollar‚Äîwill substantially improve our coinage system as well as cutting Government coin production costs.\\" He went on to declare his approval of the decision to depict Anthony on the coins: > I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will‚Äîfor the first time > in history‚Äîbear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. > Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The 'Anthony > dollar' will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their > unalienable right to vote. It will be a constant reminder of the continuing > struggle for the equality of all Americans. = Design criticism = Numismatists criticized the pairing of Susan B. Anthony's portrait with a design based on the Apollo 11 insignia. Gasparro regarded the Anthony design as the most important of his career. Remarking on the public perception of the coin, Gasparro related that \\"it's become part of a social movement. This new dollar's more than a coin; it's an issue.\\" The decision to use a portrait of Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty was met with criticism by most numismatists, who believed that the Liberty design had far greater artistic merit. Art critic and numismatist Cornelius Vermeule was highly critical of the obverse design replacement, as well as the decision to continue use of the Apollo 11 design. Vermeule noted that although Eisenhower's administration established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Anthony had no connection to the Moon landing or the U.S. space program. Commenting on the obverse and reverse pairing, he stated his belief that it was \\"a hasty marriage and a bad one\\". Although he believed that Gasparro's Anthony design was well executed, sculptor Robert Weinman criticized the decision to depict Anthony. Concerned about the possibility of other groups seeking representation on the coinage in response to its passage, Weinman characterized the Susan B. Anthony dollar legislation as a \\"billboard or campaign button approach to a national coin\\".  Reception  The similarity in size and material composition between the new Susan B. Anthony dollar (left) and the Washington quarter (right) caused immediate confusion in transactions. The first Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on December 13, 1978. First strikes at the Denver and San Francisco Mints followed on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively. Mint officials feared that the coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered the creation of a stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979. The dollars all bore a mint mark denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' for the San Francisco Mint. The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' mint mark since the Jefferson nickel issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin. In 1980, the 'P' mint mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia. The Treasury Department, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, undertook a $655,000 marketing campaign to educate bank employees and members of the public about the new coin, and the vending industry engaged in a $100 million effort to retrofit machines to accept the coins. Despite the marketing attempts, the coin received an overwhelmingly negative reception from the public. Less than two millimeters in diameter larger than the quarter and struck in the same copper-nickel composition, the Susan B. Anthony dollar was widely confused for that denomination in transactions. Mint Director Hackel noted the difference in weight and design between the two coins and expressed her belief that the dollar would eventually find favor with the public, suggesting that the coin would become \\"customary to the American people in time\\". In the months following its release, complaints mounted and public transportation and many establishments throughout the country began refusing to accept them in payment. On July 13, 1979, California Representative Jerry Lewis introduced a bill to the House of Representatives with the intent to increase the size of the coin to aid identification. Discussing the bill, which was never passed, Lewis remarked that the Anthony dollar had come to be known derisively as the \\"Carter quarter\\", due to its size and association with the President. In total, 757,813,744 dollar coins dated 1979 were struck for circulation at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints. Demand remained low through 1980, and the circulation strikes for that year totaled 89,660,708. Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage marked the end of production. At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a surplus of 520,000,000 coins in 1981. Melting the coins was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents, and the 98 cents earned from seignorage was applied to the national debt. Had the coins been melted, their seignorage would have been added to the debt. Accordingly, the coins were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed. The coin's design did have repercussions north of the border; when Canada introduced its new one-dollar coin in 1987, its dimensions were made similar so that vending machine specifications could be common between the two nations. When the Baltimore, Maryland Metro Subway opened in 1984, it used the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin as tokens with which to buy tickets. It became the largest single user of Susan B. Anthony dollar coins in its history.  1999 reissue  After passage of the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997, the Mint struck pattern coins, depicting Martha Washington and dated 1759, to test a more distinctive, gold-colored coin. Despite their unpopularity in transactions, Anthony dollars began to see heavy use in over 9,000 stamp- dispensing machines situated in United States Postal Service buildings across the country beginning in the early 1990s. Additionally, the coins finally began to be used regularly with many mass-transit systems and vending-machine operations. Various propositions were discussed in Congress since the last dollars were produced in 1981, but no action was taken to issue a new coin until the Treasury's stores of Anthony dollars became depleted by the mid 1990s. In February 1996, the vaults totaled approximately 229,500,000 coins, but that number was reduced to approximately 133,000,000 by the end of 1997. Faced with the necessity of striking more Susan B. Anthony dollars to fill the demand, the Treasury supported legislation authorizing a new dollar coin that would not be confused with the quarter. Legislation authorizing a dollar coin in a gold-colored composition and with a plain edge was introduced to the House and Senate in 1997, where it eventually received approval with a provision calling for it to depict Native American guide Sacagawea. On December 1, 1997, President Bill Clinton signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act into law. The Act, which authorized the creation of the 50 State Quarters program, included a section entitled \\"United States $1 Coin Act of 1997\\". That section officially authorized what became the Sacagawea dollar. Following passage of the act, a series of test strikes depicting Martha Washington were carried out to test various gold-colored alloys. Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design as a stop-gap measure until production began on the gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stockpiles, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 Anthony dollars dated 1999 were struck for circulation at the Philadelphia and Denver mints. Proof strikes were carried out at the Philadelphia mint; no 1999 dollars were struck at the San Francisco mint. The Anthony design was officially retired in 2000, when the new Sacagawea dollar entered production.  Collecting  As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain available in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known variety of the 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue. All dates of the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as standalone proof strikes, rather than as part of a larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.

In the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, he took 8 for 83 in the first innings against Pakistan Automobiles Corporation, and 6 for 122 and 8 for 93 against House Building Finance Corporation. Later in the season, in the PACO Cup, he took 8 for 87 against Habib Bank. He finished the season with 72 wickets at an average of 24.59.Wisden 1986, p. 1123. In 1986-87 he took 64 wickets at an average of 18.23.Wisden 1988, p. 1109. Now playing for Pakistan International Airlines, he took his best figures of 8 for 28 (and 13 for 106 in the match) against Water and Power Development Authority. He continued to play for Pakistan International Airlines until 1994-95.

She was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of Japanese-American ancestry. She served as president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1995‚Äì1996.AAS Board of Directors and Officers Rawski has written extensively on history of the Qing dynasty, and is considered a seminal figure of the school called the New Qing History.MSG Interview: Evelyn Rawski Education and career She graduated from President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu, then took her bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1961, graduating with high honors in Economics and Phi Beta Kappa. Inspired by sinologist Knight Biggerstaff at Cornell, Rawski decided to pursue historical studies in graduate school, and earned a Ph.D. in History and Far Eastern languages at Harvard University in 1968 under Yang Lien-sheng. She is fluent in English, French, Chinese, Japanese, and Manchu languages. Contributions to the New Qing History Rawski's research has centered on the social and cultural history of the Qing dynasty, often in ways that revise earlier views of political history. Education and Popular Literacy in Ch'ing China (1979) targeted the standard view that the nonphonetic nature of the Chinese writing system led to low literacy rates and held back economic growth. Paul A. Cohen judged that Rawski \\"turns this entire set of assumptions on its head....\\" Arguing that traditional village schools were accessible, texts cheap, and teachers low salaried, and defining functional literacy as the ability to read everyday texts rather a mastery of the classics, she concluded that male literacy rates in late imperial China were in fact among the highest in the pre-modern world, probably amounting to almost one literate person per family. Cohen commented that her analysis was \\"not unassailable\\" but that her \\"overall thesis\\" \\"puts the problem of literacy and popular education... in a wholly new light, and future research in this area will have to take up where she has left off.\\" , p. 173‚Äì175 In the early 1990s, Rawski joined a group of scholars who began study of the Manchu language and found new views opened by the materials they now could read. She presented these views in her 1996 presidential address to the Association of Asian Studies, Reenvisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History, which challenged the view long held by historians of China that the Manchu had been assimilated, or \\"sinicized\\" by the people they conquered. Her argument met with strong negative reaction from Ping-ti Ho in 1996 but is now widely held.Pamela Crossley, Beyond the culture: my comments on New Qing history The New Qing History school started to appear at this time. Of her monograph, The Last Emperors, Jane Kate Leonard, writing in China Review International wrote \\"is a remarkable work of historical synthesis and descriptive analysis of the intimate social world of the Qing dynasty‚Äôs ruling elite\\". Leonard continues: :Her purpose is to capture the aims and intentions of the Qing emperors from the Manchu imperial perspective, which she extrapolates from the material culture of the Qing court, the social hierarchy of the inner power structure, and the state rituals and the personal religious practices of the court. Her thesis argues that the unique material culture, social hierarchy, and rituals of kingship demonstrate that the Qing monarchs were multi-ethnic in their approach to kingship and practical governance. She further argues that their success was due not to \\"sinicization\\" but to their multiethnic perspective, which enabled them to craft regionally specific approaches to their diverse constituencies of Mongols, northeastern peoples, Tibetans, and Han Chinese.

He was born in Berlin, in a family of French Huguenots. As the king's favourite cook, he was responsible for the culinary side of royal banquets, including Thursday Dinners to which Stanislaus Augustus invited Warsaw's leading intellectuals. He followed the king to Saint Petersburg after the latter's abdication in 1795, but returned to Warsaw after his death in 1798. His cooking style combined Polish, French and other west European influences. As a mentor to aspirant Polish chefs and author of recipes which circulated in handwritten copies, he was instrumental in the development of modern Polish cuisine that was more moderate and cosmopolitan than old Polish cookery.  Life  Paul Tremo was born on 1 April 1733 or 1734 in Berlin as the middle son of Elie Tremeau and his wife, Louise Dinant. Elie's father, of the same name, was a Huguenot from the French province of Poitou, who at the turn of the 18th century fled religious persecution in France following the Edict of Fontainebleau and settled in Berlin, encouraged by the Edict of Potsdam. Both Paul Tremo's father and grandfather worked in cotton processing, but two of Elie Junior's sons ‚Äì the eldest Jacques (1729‚Äì1788) and Paul ‚Äì chose to pursue their careers as cooks. Their family name is variously noted in Berlin church records as Tremeau, Treinau or Tremon, but Jacques and Paul Polonized its spelling to Tremo upon their migration to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1762, Paul Tremo landed a job as a court chef to Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, a Polish aristocrat and titular grand pantler of Lithuania. Two years later, in 1764, Poniatowski was elected and crowned king of Poland, taking the regnal name Stanislaus Augustus. Paul Tremo and his brother, Jacques, were employed at the royal court in Warsaw, with their jobs titles variously listed in court payrolls as or (master chef). Of all chefs working at the court, it was Paul Tremo who enjoyed the status of the king's favourite cook, accompanying him in all his travels. This status can be inferred from his salary compared with those of his colleagues; in 1795, he received a payment of 902.15 florins, while two other royal master chefs earned 560 and 144 florins, respectively. Tremo lived in apartments at the Royal Castle of Warsaw and in the Royal Baths Park. Additionally, in 1789, as a token of royal favour, Tremo was given a manor house in the Warsaw suburb of Grzyb√≥w (now the part of Warsaw in the vicinity of Grzybowski Square). While Jacques Tremo was married with at least one daughter and two sons, both of whom served in Polish military formations, Paul Tremo remained single and childless. At home, he employed a female cook who prepared simple meals for him, as he never consumed the dishes he concocted at work. Following Stanislaus Augustus's abdication brought about by the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Tremo accompanied the former king to his exile in Grodno and then in Saint Petersburg. After Poniatowski's death in 1798, Tremo declined a job offer from Emperor Paul I of Russia on the pretext of travelling to a spa for health reasons and returned to Warsaw. He died in 1810 in his Grzyb√≥w manor and was buried at an unknown location in the cemetery of the Evangelical Reformed (Calvinist) Church in Warsaw.  Work  A dining table, set with turn-of-the-19th-century silverware, in the Yellow Room of the Royal Castle of Warsaw, where Thursday Dinners were held during the reign of Stanislaus Augustus Tremo gained Poniatowski's trust as the cook able to satisfy both his palate and his dietary requirements. The teetotal king suffered from gastric ailments from an early age. He usually started his day with a cup of hot chocolate or bouillon. His favourite dish was roast or stewed mutton, which he washed down with spring water. Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach. Tomatoes, for example, were considered detrimental to the monarch's health and were never used in Tremo's recipes. In the royal kitchen, Tremo oversaw all stages of meal preparation, from procuring ingredients to composing menus, directing the work of cooks and kitchen boys, to personally seasoning the dishes before serving. To broaden his culinary knowledge, he studied classic cookbooks, such as the ancient Roman Apicius, and also set out on international learning trips, which familiarized him with contemporary German, French and English cooking practices. He introduced novel French flavours and cooking techniques to Polish cuisine, making it lighter and more moderate in the use of fat, sugar, vinegar, salt and expensive exotic spices. His repertoire combined old Polish dishes with French specialities. The former included clear borscht (beetroot soup) served over (ear-shaped stuffed dumplings), Polish tripe soup, roast capon, and pike in the Polish style; the latter, , roast duck, and . At royal banquets, such as the Thursday Dinners to which Stanislaus Augustus invited Warsaw's leading intellectuals, he served the king's favourite mutton, cold cuts, , as well as game bird dishes, such as larded hazel grouse, wood grouse with red cabbage or black grouse with braised beetroots. In Warsaw, Tremo enjoyed the reputation of being one of the finest chefs in Europe. However, some of his contemporaries complained that his meats were too tough, his sauces too heavy, and his idea of west European culinary trends not always up- to-date. British traveller Elizabeth Craven could not conceal her amusement when, at a banquet given by the Polish king, she was served meat and fish doused generously with melted butter, supposedly in the English style. German- Polish traveller Georg Forster was surprised when a peasant boy whom he had given Tremo's almond cake, did not enjoy the treat. Tremo wrote at least two books in Polish, which he failed to publish during his lifetime. His ' (Kitchen Botany), about the culinary uses of various vegetables, fruits and herbs, has not survived. The other was a cookbook with about 86 recipes, which was widely circulated in manuscript copies, at least two of which have been preserved. One of them, which bears a long, Baroque title translating as The exact study of the methods of cooking and preparing dishes of meat, fish, vegetables, flour, as well as seasoning of various sauces, making punch essence, etc., contains the author's humorous motto, \\"not everyone thinks, but everyone eats.\\" Both copies were published in 1991 in two independent editions. He also influenced the development of modern Polish cuisine by helping raise the next generation of Polish chefs, many of whom worked with him as apprentices. Tremo's and his brother's signatures can be found on a master craftsman's diploma issued in Warsaw in 1783. One of Tremo's apprentices was Jan Szyttler, who went on to become a prolific food writer, best known for his ' (Hunter's Cuisine); published in 1845, it is the first Polish cookbook devoted solely to game dishes.  Publications  Tremo's cookbook has been published posthumously in two independent editions, based on two surviving manuscript copies, in the following volumes: * *  Notes   References   Sources    * * Category:1730s births Category:1810 deaths Category:Cookbook writers Category:French chefs Category:German chefs Category:Polish chefs Category:Polish food writers ","title":"Paul Tremo"},{"id":"45510027","text":"After Sundown may refer to: * After Sundown (1911 film), an Australian film * After Sundown (2006 film), an American film ","title":"After Sundown"},{"id":"45510040","text":"The Church of St. John the Evangelist (commonly called St. John's Church) is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church in the City of Orange Township, Essex County, New Jersey, within the Archdiocese of Newark. It is noted for its Gothic Revival style church (building), a prominent local landmark located at 94 Ridge Street. History =Property= The land on which the present church sits was purchased in 1865 for the sum of $10,000. It is located on the highest hill west of Manhattan and east of First Watchung Mountain. =Construction= The church was designed by Jeremiah O'Rourke in the Gothic Revival style. O‚ÄôRourke was a Newark architect who specialized in church architecture. Nearby examples of his work are the chapel at Seton Hall University (1863) and the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Newark, New Jersey (begun in 1898). The parish school, Columbus Hall, also designed by O'Rourke, was erected in 1894 across the street from the church. O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs design for St John‚Äôs Church is a Victorian adaptation of German Gothic architectonics. Like many other 19th century houses of worship in the Orange Valley, the church‚Äôs exterior is faced with locally quarried brownstone. Philanthropist and real estate speculator Llewellyn S. Haskell donated the stone for St. John‚Äôs from his quarry in West Orange. Under the direction of the pastor, Rev. Edward M. Hickey, work began on June 24, 1866. The cornerstone was blessed by James Roosevelt Bayley (first Bishop of Newark) on September 23 of that year, and the church was dedicated by Bishop Bernard John McQuaid of Newark on October 10, 1869. With its huge proportions and position on the highest hill between Manhattan and First Watchung Mountain, the building‚Äîwhich replaced a modest frame church that had been constructed nearby in 1851‚Äîdominated the area. The tower and spire were completed by 1881, and included architectural features copied from the tower of the Senlis Cathedral in France. The completion of the church and provision of its internal furnishings were achieved largely due to the efforts of Rev. Hugh P. Fleming, LL.D, M.A, who was rector of the parish from 1874 to 1908. An 1872 fire caused $7,000 damage and called attention to the extent of the debt owed by the church, which had grown to $300,000. In March 1874, when the church was to be closed to pay off the debt, Bishop Michael Corrigan of Newark ordered collections in every Catholic church in New Jersey to prevent the sale of the property (and the possible bankruptcy of the diocese). The installation of 12 electric chandeliers in 1923 is said to have been personally supervised by Thomas Edison, whose laboratories (now known as Thomas Edison National Historical Park) were located a few blocks away. Architectural features The church, which could originally accommodate 1200 people, occupies the southeast corner of the intersection of White and Ridge Streets, Orange. The building is long and wide, and the nave is long. =Stained glass= St. Joan of Arc, Zettler Studios, Munich ca 1931 The original windows, created by August Doremus in 1868, were removed in 1931. A few windows in the entry area are all that remains of these fine works of art. In 1923, von Gerichten Art Glass of Munich installed windows above the main altar, including a large triple window ( high and wide) over the sanctuary and directly behind of the main altar depicting the crucifixion with an ornamental Gothic background setting. On each side of the center window are single windows with blank panels and gothic canopies, each including a representation of three roses. The windows were installed at a cost of $5,000. Between 1930 and 1931, Zettler Studios of Munich installed windows along the aisles of the nave . =Altar= Reredos, St. Johns RC Church, Orange NJ. Goyers Brothers, Louvain, Belgium, 1892 The centerpiece of the interior is the carved oak paneling and reredos of the high altar, created by the Goyers Brothers of Louvain, Belgium, in 1892. The four rear panels which flank the altar contain angel figures in high relief. Each angel carries a scroll with a phrase from the hymn \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo.\\" The carved work is continued on the reredos, with the Last Supper, other sacred scenes, and figures of angels and saints carried upward to a great height. Wooden panels lining each side of the sanctuary feature high-relief statues of the twelve apostles. The reredos and sanctuary area cost $25,000. The sanctuary parquet floor, installed in 1892, depicts inlaid vines and leaves and other magnificent floral patterns. =Art works= Lateral bay paintings by Lamprecht of Munich and reredos During the 1880s, Lamprecht of Munich installed painted scenes from the life of Christ above the arches of the bays. The series of paintings continues into the sanctuary; they are in the style of the Overbeck school of art. Fourteen images of the stations of the cross, carved from wood by Italian craftsmen, were installed in 1871. =Spire= Although ground was broken in 1866, it was not until 1881 that the elaborate spire (with features copied from Senlis Cathedral, France) with protruding gargoyles and statues of the four evangelists, was added. The spire features a richly crocheted area near the top. The original height of the spire was . On August 1, 1922 a gilded cross, which measured was installed at the top of the spire. A moving picture was made of the unusual event and was shown on screens throughout the country. In 1881 a chime of 11 bells was installed in the tower. Three of the bells were cast in Italy and displayed at the Exposition Universelle (1878), where they had been awarded the gold medal of excellence. The remaining eight were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland. The bells were solemnly blessed on November 27, 1881 by Bishop Winand Wigger of Newark. The pitch of the heaviest bell is C in the middle octave. In about 1955 the bells were fitted with an electric striking mechanism, controlled by a small keyboard located in the gallery. The keyboard range is C to D, and includes two semi-tones, F-sharp and B-flat. In 1915 E. Howard & Co. of Boston installed a tower clock of four illuminated dials, made of bronze, each in diameter. The clock cost $5,000, and was the gift of A&P; grocery chain founder and former Orange mayor George Huntington Hartford ‚Äì who, in 1869, had been the first person to be baptized in St. John‚Äôs. For many decades, the clock was connected to the chime of bells so that the Westminster Quarters rang every 15 minutes and the Angelus rang at 6:00 A.M., noon, and 6:00 P.M. Hook & Hastings Organ Built by E&G.G; Hook & Hastings, 1879 St. John's church features a historic pipe organ, located in the gallery. The instrument, built in 1879, is Opus 950 of E. and G.G. Hook & Hastings, a Boston organ building firm which was one of the premier organ building firms in the United States. The $7,000 contract was signed on June 9, 1879, and the organ was played for the first time on December 11, 1879. It contains 2,412 pipes in 38 ranks, with pipes ranging in length from to . The longest pipes, those of the Great Open Diapason 16', are visible in the facade, and the large wooden pipes of the pedal Open Diapason 16' form the side facades. At the 1979 centennial of the organ, the Organ Historical Society cited the instrument as having \\"particular historical\\" merit. This citation has only been granted to about 400 instruments since 1975. Further details about the organ are published in the database of Pipe Organs, operated by the Organ Historical Society. =Hartman-Beaty Restoration= By 1970, after nearly 100 years of almost daily use, the instrument had deteriorated and become difficult to tune or play. The Hartman-Beaty Organ Company of Englewood, New Jersey, was awarded the contract to clean and renovate all of the pipework as well as the chests and wind systems. The first and most essential part of the restoration project was to re-leather the wind reservoirs, and then restore the Great, Choir, Swell, and Pedal divisions. No re-voicing was done. With the renovation completed in 1972, the instrument was featured at a recital on June 27, 1973, during the 18th Annual Convention of the Organ Historical Society. Various events held in the church On several occasions, world-famous Metropolitan Opera stars Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar were guest soloists at the church.

Her BioArt works have aroused strong responses and have been a basis for discussions of the body, art, and ethics. Early life Chrissy Conant was born in Hawaii and grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. She currently lives and works in New York City. Education Conant has a Bachelor of Arts from Boston University and a Master of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts. Artworks Conant says that her work reflects her personal struggles and that she finds the painstaking processes of creating them cathartic. Her artworks include the following: =Chrissy Caviar= Conant researched the harvesting of fish eggs for caviar, and the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). She then went through extensive physical treatments to create a 'product' from herself, which she carefully prepared and presented under the brand name Chrissy Caviar. She documented the entire process on video. Conant injected herself for six weeks with fertility drugs so that she would produce multiple eggs, followed by a final hormone injection to make the eggs mature at the same time. An endocrinologist and embryologist harvested her eggs in a forty-five-minute hospital procedure. Conant carefully placed each of her thirteen eggs in a flask filled with human tubal fluid, a saline solution used to preserve and transport human ova for IVF. Each flask was set in a jar of clear silicone gel, sealed, and labelled with a photograph of the artist reclining and the information that the jar contains \\"one egg\\" \\"Caucasian\\" with \\"human tubal fluid\\" which must be refrigerated properly. Conant even applied for and received a trademark for Chrissy Caviar¬Æ, registered as both a \\"food product\\" and as \\"DNA\\". An installation of the Chrissy Caviar project, including the video and a deli case containing the bottled eggs, debuted at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in May 2002. Conant refused to agree to a chef's \\"tasting\\" of her eggs, but has said that she would sell the deli case and its contents. Chrissy Caviar has been shown at a number of exhibitions, including Molecules that Matter at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in 2008, where Conant gave a guest lecture entitled \\"An Artist Hijacks the Biochemistry of Life\\". The exhibit has been considered thought-provoking BioArt, \\"encouraging viewers to think about bigger issues surrounding the ethical limits of art and the use of reproductive technologies\\". Conant has said that she hoped the work would provoke strong reactions, and wanted to spur discussion of women's conflicts about child- bearing, particularly as they get older. Chrissy Caviar has been criticized for its commodification of the body and used as a basis of discussions for both art and ethics. =Chrissy Skin Rug= For Chrissy Skin Rug, Conant was covered with Vaseline and a mold-making silicone to make a life-sized, flesh- colored silicone rubber cast of her body. From this, she created a \\"human skin\\" rug, spread on a wood floor, with a lifelike head and hair attached. It was displayed at Morgan Lehman Gallery in a show entitled Sexy Time: a Group Effort in 2008. The piece was intended to spur consideration of sexism, gender, and commonalities between people and animals. It demonstrates how \\"women are dehumanized when treated as one-dimensional sex objects\\", and has been described as \\"disconcerting\\" and uncomfortably voyeuristic. =Teddy Chrissy= Teddy Chrissy takes a teddy bear and transforms it into self- protective armor. Conant deconstructed a teddy bear, replacing the fur with stainless steel pins and stuffing the bear with steel wool. =Chrissy Homeland Security Blanket= Conant created the Chrissy Homeland Security Blanket in March 2003. Described as a \\"three-part sculptural project\\", she incorporated the U.S. Department of Homeland Security terms for levels of threat, \\"severe,\\" \\"high,\\" \\"elevated,\\" \\"guarded,\\" and \\"low\\" to make colorful chokers, blankets, and wall hangings. She also applied for the trademark \\"Chrissy Homeland Security¬Æ Blanket\\". Conant's use of the trademark \\"Homeland Security Blanket\\" was later contested by Shirley Ivins. According to trademark records, although Ivins did file for the trademark, her registration was cancelled because she did not file an acceptable declaration. The Chrissy Homeland Security Blanket has been included in exhibitions such as Pillow Pageant and Uncomfortable Conversations. It has been described as an \\"unsettling\\" indicator of the inner battle between security and anxiety, and the marketing of fear. =Every Kept Book I Have Read= Every Kept Book I Have Read is a text-based sculpture, incorporating vinyl, cement, goat leather, paper, board, and gold. It is intended to suggest connections between books, consumerism, memory, and holding on to the past.

History Abrahams was born in Sheerness, Kent, and was educated in Colchester, England, then went to work for Hyams & Co., clothing retailers of London, and became a commercial traveller for the company. In 1850 he emigrated to South Australia, where he went into business as an importer, taking Thompson (previously with Acraman & Co.) as a partner; dissolving the partnership around 1862. In 1864 he accepted positions as secretary to the Imperial Permanent Building Society for a short time, and to the Equitable Fire Insurance Company, which he held until 1891. In 1880 he, with Catherine Helen Spence, William Kay and a few others, founded the Executor, Trustee, and Agency Company in South Australia, using Dutch companies in South Africa as a model, and was elected its manager, a post he held until September 1891, when forced to resign by failing eyesight. He was a prominent philanthropist: he was treasurer of the Assyrian Fund and the Indian Relief Fund. He was on the board of the Home for Incurables, and secretary of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He was one of the oldest members of the Jewish Synagogue in Adelaide, and at various times served as secretary and treasurer, though not as actively involved in later years. He was a founding member of the South Australian Society of Arts, its first treasurer, and its secretary 1866‚Äì1885. He was elected to the gazetted position on the Board of Governors of the Public Library in 1884 and served as chairman 1888‚Äì1889. He played a prominent part in the management of the Art Gallery and Zoological Gardens. He was a Justice of the Peace and a prominent Freemason. Personal He lived for twenty years at the York Hotel, Rundle Street. In January 1892, feeling the effects of a hot summer, he made a rare trip outside South Australia to Hobart, Tasmania, and died in Melbourne on the return voyage. He was buried in the Jewish section of the West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide. He was courtly and courteous, punctual to the point of punctiliousness, polite, precise and utterly dependable. He was a great lover of art, with a deep knowledge of the Old Masters, of which he owned a small but valuable collection. He never married. Recognition He was in 1881, in recognition of his service to art, presented with a portrait of himself, painted by J. A. Upton, which is held by the Art Gallery.

She has a multimedia practice, including painting, photography, film, and video, with an investigation of language as her primary paradigm. On works in media of film and video, she collaborates with her husband Igor Kopystiansky. Her independent works and their joint works are shown internationally and held in museum and private collections around the world. Biography Kopystiansky was born 11 November 1950 in Voronezh, Russia, and from late Seventies till late Eighties was part of a second- generation of \\"Soviet non-conformist artists\\" w. In 1979, Svetlana Kopystiansky turned to the avant-garde tradition. Her Correct Figures/Incorrect Figures (1979) commented on the work of Malevich, while White Album (1979) was based on the concept of the ‚Äúfound object‚Äù introduced by Marcel Duchamp. The works on paper Plays mimicked Samuel Beckett's deadpan humor and meditations on life's banality and contained a reference to Alexander Rodchenko‚Äôs ideas. Kopystiansky started working on her two conceptually and formally related series- Landscapes and Seascapes- in 1980. Both series merge text with image: a closer look at either a landscape or seascape reveals a pattern of handwritten text filling the canvas, with excerpts borrowed from classic authors, such as Leo Tolstoy, Beckett and Paul Eluard. In 1988, she and her husband and collaborator Igor Kopystiansky left the Soviet Union and moved to New York City, which has been their home base since then. In 1990 in New York Svetlana started a new series of large scale sculptures and installation works constructed from editions of books as found objects or readymades. In this group of works real books were placed in wooden boxes in a way that they become visual objects with pages open towards the viewer. For these works were used editions of novels in English. In 1990, Svetlana and Igor Kopystiansky received a DAAD artists-in-residency grant that brought them to Berlin, Germany, and resulted in their first solo museum exhibition with a catalogue, \\"In the Tradition,\\" curated by Ren√© Block for the Berlinische Galerie, Museum of Modern Art, in the Martin Gropius-Bau, Berlin in 1991. In the 1990s, her individual and joint practice expanded and the work was shown in major international presentations, including the 1992 Sydney Biennial, the 1994 Sao Paulo Biennial, 1997's Skulpture Projekt, M√ºnster. and documenta 11 in 2002, and collected by museums including the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum and Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C.; Henry Art Gallery in Seattle; Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, New Jersey; Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne Center Pompidou, Paris; Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Saint-Etienne M√©tropole, France; Tate Modern, London; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; Museo Nacional Reina Sofia; Folkwang Museum in Essen; Ludwig Forum for International Art, Aachen; Berlinische Galerie; Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main; MUMOK Vienna, Austria; Centre for Contemporary Art Luigi Pecci, Prato, Italy; Frac Corsica, France; MOCAK, Museum of Contemporary Art Krakow, Poland; Muzeum Sztuki Lodz, Poland. Increasingly the Kopystianskys make video. Their 1996-7 video Incidents, filmed on streets of Chelsea Manhattan was first shown by curator Harald Szeemann in the Lyon Biennale in 1997, meditates on the potential beauty and pathos of discarded objects, as they are balletically blown around by wind along a city street. Later collaborations, such as 2005's Yellow Sound harks back to Svetlana's citations, within her 1980s paintings, of modernist masters. Yellow Sound takes its title from a Wassily Kandinsky theater production, and its silent structure and running time from John Cage's famous composition 4'33\\" (1952), in which a piano player sits at the keyboard, lift the lid and stay motionless and silent for the next four minutes and thirty-three seconds. A 2006 film installation, Pink & White-A Play in Two Time Directions, features eight projections showing black-and-white found footage, emphasizing their interest in early cinema, and the surrealist graphic intensity of photographer Man Ray. Lisson Gallery in London represented them from 2001 to 2011.  Honors and awards  In 2000, Kopystiansky was awarded the K√§the-Kollwitz-Preis by the Akademie der K√ºnste, Berlin, Germany, and in 2008 she received a Residences Internationales aux Recollets in Paris, France.

He served three tours of duty in Afghanistan during Operation Herrick: in 2009, 2011 and 2013. =Victoria Cross action= The actions for which Leakey was awarded the Victoria Cross occurred on 22 August 2013 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. A routine joint patrol composed of British paratroopers, US Marines and Afghan soldiers had targeted a village to search for illegal weapons. Having been flown into the area in Chinook helicopters, the patrol was attacked by machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades soon after dismounting. Leakey's helicopter had landed on a hill near the village and he, with three other paratroopers and an Afghan soldier, were to provide fire support for the main segment of the patrol. From their vantage point, his section could see the attack and heard over their radio that someone had been injured. Leakey ran up the hill to assess the seriousness of the attack and came to the conclusion that urgent action was needed. Though he was only a lance corporal, he took control of the situation and led his section down to the group under attack. Having reached the group under attack, he gave first aid to the wounded US Marine Corps captain and began to evacuate him from the battlefield. While under fire, he returned to the machine guns that his section had left at the top of the hill. He moved one to a better position to fire at the attacking Taliban even though he was under constant, accurate fire (bullets were ricocheting off the weapon he was carrying). His actions inspired other soldiers to join in the fight back. While he was manning the machine gun, he was also shouting updates of the situation into his radio. Having realised that more than one machine gun would be needed to effectively fight back the insurgents, he allowed his gun to be taken over by another soldier. He then ran once more through heavy fire to retrieve a second machine gun, position it in a suitable site, and then manned it to fire at the Taliban. The skirmish lasted approximately 45 minutes during which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. It was only when air support arrived that fighting ceased. When it did, he handed the second machine gun over to another soldier. He then returned to the injured American officer and oversaw his medical evacuation.

Concerned with understanding and improving human performance, he is known for developing a framework for preparing learning objectives, and criterion referenced instruction (CRI), as well as addressing areas of goal orientation, student evaluation, student motivation, classroom environment, educational change, performance technology, and instructional design.  Personal life / biography  Robert Frank Mager was born in the summer of 1923 shortly before The Great Depression. As any other little boy, Mager had aspirations of becoming a fireman, policeman, detective, cowboy and even a rocketship pilot. Mager was picked-on in school. This was as a result of him being skipped from fourth grade to sixth grade. This made him one of the smallest in his class. To add insult to injury, in his time, being left-handed was considered a heinous act and often resulted in a sharp rap on the knuckles. Subsequently, Mager switched to writing with his right-hand. Music also formed part of Mager‚Äôs explorations as he jumped from one instrument to the other. At one time he played the violin, then the clarinet and even the saxophone. Eventually he found ‚Äòhis love‚Äô the banjo, and has even been part of a banjo band. Mager's ‚Äòtrue love‚Äô his wife, is a professional classical musician. He died in May 2020 at the age of 96.In Memoriam: Robert F. Mager, 1923-2020 =Drafted into the Army= In his book, Life in the Pinball Machine: Careening from There to Here, Mager makes an analogy of his life to a pinball. He likened his life as the ball and the different experiences in his lives as the pins of machine that would bump and jostle him eventually to his current research in the Instructional Design field. One such experience occurred in 1943 when Mager was drafted into the military. One of his initial responsibilities was that of a company clerk which involved him interacting with new recruits. Mager was able to observe discrepancies with performances due to lack of information. =Today= Mager is credited with revolutionizing the performance improvement industry with his groundbreaking work, the Criterion Referenced Instruction (CRI) framework. =Other interests= Over the years, Mager had also been an accomplished unicyclist, banjo player, ventriloquist, crime novelist, and tap dancer.  Education and academic career  After serving in World War II, Mager completed his undergraduate studies in Psychology with minors in Philosophy and Speech at Ohio University (1948), then taught broadcasting techniques and business speech at Tyler Commercial College while studying Electronics there, and studied Radio Broadcasting at the CBS School (NYU campus, 1948). He completed graduate studies (A.B and M.A. degrees) in Psychology at Ohio University in 1950, and taught psychology there the following year, before moving on to completing his PhD in Experimental Psychology at State University of Iowa in 1954. He also taught psychology at Sacramento State College in 1958-59. He served as research scientist for the Human Resources Research Office.  Research  =Instructional sequencing= In the early 1960s Mager created a small experiment to determine what instructional sequence would be logical and meaningful for adult learners and compared this to the usual instructor-led sequence of instruction. The findings he reported in On the sequencing of instructional content, suggested that instruction led by the learner takes on a different sequence from that led by an instructor, it allowed them to take their own knowledge into account and resulted in a more motivated learner. Further experiments and research on this subject by Mager and his colleagues led to the concept of learner-control as a method which when introduced to technology-assisted instruction was found to improve learning performance. This has been a key concept in self-paced multimedia courses and has influenced distance and online learning. =Learning objectives= In 1962 Preparing objectives for programmed instruction Mager pioneered a new approach to instructional design which involved establishing objectives for instruction. This made such an impact that in later editions as Preparing Instructional Objectives it became, it could be said, the manual for preparing instruction because of its clearly outlined steps on how to define objectives. It so revolutionized instructional methods in schools that a bill was passed in California that required teachers to describe what they wanted their students to achieve (i.e., behavioral outcomes) by writing these as objectives (the Stull Act, 1972). =Goal analysis= Mager found that establishing objectives could easily be misused, and went further to formulate five steps that would clearly guide the process of defining solid and measurable outcomes. This resulted in the publication Goal analysis in 1972, which became a cornerstone of the CRI method and ensuing workshops. =Criterion Referenced Instruction (CRI)= Mager along with Peter Pipe is well known for developing the Criterion Referenced Instruction (CRI) a framework for Instructional Design. The origins of Instructional Design dated back as early as World War II with the need for creating training programs. Mager had firsthand experience with these training regimes. However, he found that they were not meeting the goals that they were set out to meet. From this phenomenon, Mager went about seeking ways to improve training delivery. These experiences led Mager to publish his work in a book later titled, Preparing Instructional Objectives: A Critical Tool in the Development of Effective Instruction. In his publications, Mager usually starts out with a fable. In this book the fable is about a sea-horse which went out seeking a fortune. Unfortunately, the sea horse got side-tracked by the different sea creatures he met along the way and eventually ended up being swallowed by a shark. The moral of the fable :if you're not sure where you're going, you're liable to end up some place else. Consequently, in his book, Mager speaks of the importance of knowing precisely what is needed to be achieved before embarking on any instructional design process. The CRI framework is based upon using objectives (instructional objectives) to drive instruction. Effective Instructional objectives should have three components: # Performance - Identifies specifically what the learner should be able to do after the instruction # Condition - Identifies the conditions under which the performance is to occur - upon what (\\"the mission field\\"), with/without what support (\\"given ...\\") # Criterion - Describes how well the learner must perform in order to be acceptable The CRI is divided into four stages. # The Goal/task Analysis - The specific competencies that are needed are identified. # Performance Objectives - The criterion, this provides clear cut outcomes as well as states how they would be evaluated. # Criterion Referenced Testing - The actual evaluation that will be used to test whether or not the performance objectives were carried out to the required standard.Criterion-referenced test # Learning modules - Involves the development of the actual modules that would be used in the training/instruction. This instructional framework is designed in such a way that students are expected to gain mastery in the specific modules by evaluating themselves using assessment tools built into the program. Mager was influenced by the works of Robert M. Gagn√© and Malcolm Knowles.

The song was released in May 1967 following the success of the band's previous single, \\"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\\". Although the follow-up did not have the same success, \\"Get Me to the World on Time\\" still charted at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single also fared slightly better in the UK, where it reached number 42. History =Recording= The song was recorded at American Recording Company with multiple sound effects, and recording techniques which were highly complex. Similar to \\"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\\", the composition begins in low-range tones until the sudden shift. Singer James Lowe explained that the opening to the track is actually \\"[producer] Dave Hassinger groaning through a mike, into the tremolo of a Fender amp. It creates pulse-like overtones that sound like strings\\". Vocals by Lowe were initially soft until climbing to higher notes alongside the instrumentals. The instrumentals featured a Bo Diddley-styled riff (added by the band) played in the percussion, and given a psychedelic effect with a fuzz-distorted guitar. The band added in the rhythm while recording it in studio, one of the few times the group's input was accepted. They had sought to expand the track by including more electronic instrumentals and effects, but it was not allowed. The ending of the song, deemed the \\"spaceship\\", by playing the high E note on guitar until it reached the last fret, and an oscillator matched the peak. = Songwriting = Tucker and Jones wrote the song specifically for the Electric Prunes, deliberately including highly sexual (for the time) lyrics (\\"one kiss from you and my whole body starts to actin' strange, you shake up all my hormones, you put me through a change\\" etc.). The title refers to the song \\"Get Me to the Church on Time\\" from the 1956 musical My Fair Lady. =Release and performances= The track was released in May 1967, a month after its inclusion on their debut album release, and reached Top 40 success in the United States. It was the band's last single to chart in the Top 40. Despite the band's difficulty in mimicking the studio recorded version at live performances, the song was a favorite among their fans. To compensate for the lack of sound effects, the band normally expanded the composition beyond its regular track length.

He was leader of his band, Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho and was signed to DEL Records. Life Ariel Camacho was born to Benito Camacho and Reynalda Barza on July 8, 1992 in Guamuchil, Sinaloa. He started singing at the age of 12 in Angostura, Sinaloa. When he was in middle school, he met C√©sar Iv√°n S√°nchez, who played guitar and did back up vocals. Camacho later sought to expand his group and found a tuba player, Omar Burgos. His first concert was held in Tijuana, in which he played for more than 40,000 people. He quickly became known for his expressive way of playing the requinto (12 string guitar). He became known as \\"La Tuyia\\" due to a childhood nickname given to him by his grandfather because his guitar was much bigger than him. He decided to form a band in the start of 2013. His band \\"Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho\\" consisted of \\"El Tigre\\", Cesar S√°nchez (rhythm guitar and backing vocals) and Omar Burgos, \\"El Cenizo\\" (tuba). Camacho was the lead singer and played lead guitar (Requinto) in the band. His band quickly became known due to their unusual combination of standard guitar, requinto, and tuba. Among their most successful songs were \\"Hablemos\\", \\"Te Metiste\\", \\"El Karma\\" and \\"Rey de Corazones\\". He was later nicknamed \\"El Rey de Coraz√≥nes\\" after releasing \\"Rey de Corazones\\" a song that quickly made his group known through social media. Camacho was praised for maintaining a classical element in his regional music by paying attention to the songwriters who had come before him such as Miguel y Miguel (Camacho's favorite artists). He was also a frequent collaborator with other corrido singers, including Grupo Fernandez, Marca Registrada, Los Traviesos De La Sierra and Regulo Caro. Death On February 25, 2015, Camacho and three other people were in a car accident on the road from Angostura, Sinaloa. Camacho was returning from a performance at a music festival, Carnaval de Mocorito. Camacho and two others died and one person was injured. They were riding in a 1994 Honda Accord when Camacho lost control. The accident reportedly occurred at two in the morning on highway Angostura- La Reforma. Camacho died on impact. It is unclear whether he was driving intoxicated although it was reported he was driving at excessive speed. He had posted a video on his Facebook page a day before his death, inviting his fans and \\"all the beautiful ladies out there\\" to attend his next concert in March 2015. He died at the age of 22. Legacy Following his death, his group's song \\"El Karma\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in March and the album hit the TOP FIVE of the Latin albums chart. Shortly after his death, his band \\"Los Plebes del Rancho\\" changed their name as a tribute to Camacho into \\"Los Plebes Del Rancho de Ariel Camacho.\\" They continue to make albums in honor of Camacho, like \\"Recuerden Mi Estilo\\", alongside Camacho's father, Benito Camacho. Many have paid tribute to Camacho through the use of songs such as Virlan Garcia with \\"Hasta el Cielo\\", Los Traviezoz de la Zierra with \\"Mis Ultimos Momentos\\" and \\"Un Mentado Ariel.\\" An album in tribute to Camacho was also released in 2017 called \\"Ariel Camacho Para Siempre\\" that features artists such as Gerardo Ortiz, Regulo Caro, and Revolver Cannabis. Each year on the 25th of February in memory of Camacho, his band, family members, fans, and other artists come together at his grave to commemorate him.

His father had been a disciple of the Ben Ish Chai in Baghdad before immigrating to Palestine in 1924. In 1931, the year Shalom was born, his father was appointed rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem. Shalom began studying at Porat Yosef Yeshiva at the age of 13, and developed a reputation for \\"diligence and ingenuity\\". He married Yael, the daughter of Rabbi Mansour Ben Shimon, a Safed kabbalist who also taught at Porat Yosef. The couple has eight children. Notwithstanding his youth, Cohen began delivering shiurim at Porat Yosef after his wedding, and has taught students for decades. He was named rosh yeshiva of the Old City branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in 1966. Though his father and father-in-law were kabbalists, he himself is not. Political activity Cohen entered the political arena for the first time in 1984, when he agreed to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's request to support the founding of the Shas party and serve on the new Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah rabbinic council. In April 2014, six months after Yosef's death, Cohen succeeded him as nasi (president) of the council. Cohen is an outspoken critic of Modern Orthodox and secular Jews in Israel.

He also served as deputy prime minister and justice minister in the caretaker government of Georgi Bliznashki between August 6 and November 7, 2014. In early 2017 he founded the Yes, Bulgaria! political party whose priorities include institutional reforms and fight against corruption.  Education  Ivanov has a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree from the University of Sofia (St. Kliment Ohridski). He has specialized in US National Security Law and Judicial Appointments Procedures at the American University's Washington College of Law through the Fulbright/Hubert Humphrey Fellowship Program.  Career  Between 1996 and 2002, he worked as a coordinator of legal and justice reform projects under the Initiative for Rule of Law at the American Bar Association. Between 2002 and 2006, he worked as an independent consultant for various international institutions and private clients on projects related to the evaluation of legislations and promoting the rule of law. Between 2006 and 2014, Ivanov was Program Director at the Bulgarian Institute for Legal Initiatives, where he led projects related to the judicial reform, the prevention of corruption and promoting the rule of law. He was registered as a lawyer in 2002, but because of unpaid bar association fees he lost his license to practice law In December 2016, Ivanov announced his intention to create a new political party called \\"Yes, Bulgaria!\\" (–î–∞, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è!) under the slogan \\"Let's get political!\\". In a bid to promote the new political entity, he initiated a series of meetings entitled \\"Is there a Bulgarian dream? Talks about Bulgaria\\".  Official Functions  Hristo Ivanov was appointed Deputy Prime Minister for justice, internal affairs and security, as well as Justice Minister in the transitional government of Georgi Bliznashki. After the transitional cabinet's term expired, Ivanov was appointed as Justice Minister in the Second Borisov Cabinet on November 8, 2014. He resigned on December 9, 2015 after disagreements with Boyko Borisov over Ivanov's proposed justice reform plan. Ivanov was primarily worried about the excessive powers of Bulgaria's prosecution.  Commitment to the Rule of Law  Following his resignation from Borisov's government, Ivanov remained committed to the rule of law and continued to argue for reform in Bulgaria's Prosecution. His opinion was shared by the Venice Commission whose President emphasized that ‚ÄúThe Soviet model of [Bulgaria's] prosecution must be decisively turned down. It turns it into a source of corruption and blackmail and creates opportunities for its use for political aims.‚Äù In 2017, Ivanov repeatedly argued that Bulgaria's Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov should resign \\"without any doubt.\\" Indeed, Tsatsarov was nominated for sanctions under the Magnitsky Act which allows the US Government to sanction foreign government officials who violate human rights to hide corruption. Ivanov has expressed discontent that all recent reports by the Turkish Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department refer to cigarette smuggling by the Bulgarian company Bulgartabac, but the Bulgarian prosecution refuses to investigate. Hristo Ivanov is a vocal critic of the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification to which Bulgaria is subjected by the European Commission. Under this mechanism, the Commission is supposed to verify progress in key areas such as judicial independence and the fight against corruption. Ivanov argues, however, that this mechanism has been \\"politically killed\\": He contends that Jean-Claude Juncker and Frans Timmermans make unprincipled comments that this mechanism would be terminated for Bulgaria despite the fact that there is no real judicial reform and the government establishes \\"authoritarian practices.\\"  Personal life  Hristo Ivanov is married and has two sons. He maintains an active Facebook page.

The statue was found in South Italian Baiae and received her name on account of the connection to Magna Graecia. It is made of Parian marble and has a height of 1.8 m. The statue initially belonged to the collection of Lord Hope and was later acquired by Michael Embeirikos, who gave it to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens in 1924. The statue was restored by the sculptor Antonio Canova, since it initially lacked head, neck and right arm. Aphrodite is depicted largely naked, with only a himation slung over her buttocks and held in place over her genitals with her left hand. The rest of the garment falls to the ground behind and beside her. The wide stream of cloth also fulfills the function of a statue support. The two feet are close together on a plinth, with the left leg made to serve as the supporting leg and the right lef as the loose one. With her right hand, the goddess attempts to cover her left breast. The head is twisted to the left. Thus the statue belongs to the Venus pudica type, which derives from a statue of the famous sculptor Praxiteles, the Aphrodite of Cnidus. The statue is a Roman copy of a Greek original.

Biography  Albert Arnz was the son of Maria Catharina Carolina and Heinrich Arnz (1785‚Äì1854), a well-known bookseller and printer (he owned Arnz & Comp.). He studied painting from 1854 to 1860 at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, there two of his teachers were Andreas and Oswald Achenbach. The latter married Arnz's sister Julie (born 1827), and with him he traveled to Italy a number of times. Another brother in law, the husband of his sister Marie Anna Fernandine (born 1829), was the D√ºsseldorfer painter Albert Flamm. Yet another brother in law, husband of Arnz's oldest sister Marie (born 1825), was the historical painter Joseph Fay. Arnz's brother August (born 1813) was the manager of the Arnz & Comp. location in Leiden until his death in 1846; his brother Carl (born 1821) was likewise a location manager for the company, while his brother Otto (born 1823) became a landscape painter like Albert, but oriented more toward realism. Finally, Friedrich (born 1826) married Antonetta Josepha, the sister of D√ºsseldorfer portrait and genre painter Philipp Schmitz (1824‚Äì1887), in 1851. Combined driver Benno von Achenbach and naval engineer Oswald Flamm were nephews of Arnz. Arnz was a member of the art society Malkasten and participated in their tableaux vivants beginning in 1875. He lived at Schadowstra√üe 52, the location where in 1900 the Jugendstil-styled Ibach-Haus was built.  Selected works Blick auf die Burg Regenstein im Harz Heimkehrende Langhornrinder in der Campagna Romana, 1879 Arnz painted landscapes of Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. His paintings show his membership of the D√ºsseldorfer Schule, and many show a kinship with his teacher Oswald Achenbach, especially in their effective treatment of light and color. * Blick auf die Burg Regenstein im Harz * Schweizer Landschaft * Waldlandschaft mit Schafherde * Ruinen des alten Rom, 1869 * Das Kolosseum * Strand bei Neapel, 1871 * Heimkehrende Langhornrinder in der Campagna Romana (Abendstimmung), 1879 * Der Venustempel von Baiae am Golf von Neapel, 1897 * Engelsbr√ºcke in Rom mit Engelsburg und Petersdom, 1902  Literatur  * Hermann Alexander M√ºller: Biographisches K√ºnstler-Lexikon.

These sites offer evidence of human habitation dating to not long after the retreat of the glaciers following the Wisconsin glaciation, with extensive stone tool workshops working with red chert found in abundance in the area. Stone tools made from sources in this region have been found at archaeological sites across New England. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description Munsungan (or Munsungun) Lake and Chase Lake are located in far northern Piscataquis County, Maine, draining via Munsungan Stream and the Aroostook River into the Saint John River. The two lakes are connected to each other by a relatively short waterway called The Thoroughfare. In the area on either side of the lakes there are a series of rock outcrops containing a variety of chert that early human occupants found useful for the manufacture of stone tools. Although the lakes probably had a higher level then than they do now, a series of well- drained terraces on either side of The Thoroughfare were apparently favorable for the habitation. Archaeological investigation of the larger region have identified more than 100 sites of interest. The Thoroughfare region includes seven areas where evidence habitation dating from the Ceramic period to the Paleoindian have been identified. One of the major sites in the district, the Fluted Point Site (survey number 154.14) covers more than , representing a large habitation and workshop area, while another, the Windy Point Site (survey number 154.16) is a much smaller workshop site. Both of these were excavated in the early 1980s. Munsungan Lake Native populations of togue and land-locked Atlantic salmon use the cold-water habitat of this deep lake. These large fish prey on rainbow smelt and squaretail spawning in tributaries Atkins Brook, Bluffer Brook, Cedar Brook, Chase Brook, Currier Brook, Munsungan Brook, Norway Brook, and Reed Brook.

Her life was dedicated to the care of ill people and she even spent a long period to that end in Israel and Palestine before returning to her native Poland where she became a close collaborator of Honorat Kozminski. Her initiatives to aid the poor and those in need included tending to elder women in her apartments or in going to hospitals and in the streets to help those that needed her charitable assistance. Her beatification cause started on 25 August 1993 and she later became titled as Venerable on 19 December 2011; she was beatified in Poland on 9 June 2013. Life Ma≈Çgorzata Szewczyk was born circa 1828 in Shepetivka - now modern Ukraine - to Jan and Marianna; her mother was her father's second wife and had a daughter with his deceased former wife. In her childhood she lost her parents - her father in 1835 and her mother in 1837 - and her older half-sister oversaw her care and upbringing as a result. Her half-sister taught her basic arithmetic and had married at this point but still took good care of her. Sometime from 1837 to 1840 she made her First Communion and received her Confirmation. Her call to the religious life was constant and so in 1848 she entered the Third Order of Saint Francis of Assisi. Due to the political situation in her occupied Poland she was not able to join a religious order on a formal level. To strengthen her faith and love for God in 1870 she undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; this moved her to a profound degree and her experience prompted her to dedicate her life to help the poor and the ill as well as the old. Her trip to the Middle East was via boat to Haifa and then first to Jerusalem; she spent time living in Nazareth and left there in 1872 for Poland though making a brief detour as a pilgrim to Loreto. This desire to become a religious was one that she spoke of to her confessor Honorat Kozminski who approved of her decision and encouraged her to begin her work. The two first met in the autumn of 1873 in Warsaw where she visited and it was he who oversaw her Franciscan development while she lived and worked at an orphanage from 1873 to 1878; Kozminski received her Franciscan vows on 8 April 1881 after she had made her initial vows on 24 August 1878. The first step she made was to invite two poor and sick elder women to live in her apartment in 1880 and she was taking care of them in secret because charitable or church activities were forbidden according to the decrees of the Russian Emperor who at the time ruled over Poland. It was not too long before a few more women moved in with her and joined her in her work and so she rented another apartment in 1884 in Warsaw. Later to accommodate the growing number and better serve those in need she decided to purchase a new house with a garden. On 18 April 1881 - following the advice of Kozminski - she founded a new religious congregation whose aim was to help the poor and those who were most in need. The order became the Seraphic Sisters and she assumed the religious name of \\"≈Åucja\\" who became the Superior General from the order's establishment until ill health on 27 April 1904 prompted her resignation. The last months of her life were spent in Nieszawa. Her constant work ethic and extensive service to others took a toll on her health and towards the end of her life she developed a series of difficult health problems. Her death came on the morning of 5 June 1905 at her convent (she had received the Anointing of the Sick) and she had suffered from poor sight prior to her death. Ecclesial authorities granted special permission on 16 November 1931 for her remains to be moved to Oswiecim and interred in her order's corresponding church but were relocated on two other occasions on 18 January 1951 and 22 February 2013. Her order now operates in places such as Belarus and France and in 2005 had 679 religious in 76 houses. The order received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius X on 12 February 1909 and full pontifical approval from Pope Pius XII on 3 March 1953 while the order was at some stage aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Beatification The beatification celebration in 2013. The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 25 August 1993 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled her as a Servant of God; the diocesan process opened in the Krak√≥w archdiocese and Cardinal Franciszek Macharski oversaw it from 9 November 1993 until its closure on 15 June 1996. The C.C.S. later validated this process in Rome on 6 December 1996 while later receiving the Positio dossier in 2008. Theological advisors approved the cause's continuation on 5 October 2010 as did the C.C.S. on 6 December 2011 which allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to confirm her heroic virtue and name her as Venerable on 19 December 2011. The miracle that led to her beatification was the 1975 nun's cure from a severe case of pneumonia; this was investigated on a diocesan level and it received C.C.S. validation on 22 January 1999 before medical experts approved it on 23 February 2012. The theologians approved this miracle on 7 July 2012 as did the C.C.S. on 10 December 2012; Benedict XVI approved the miracle on 20 December 2012 and confirmed that she would be beatified. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Pope Francis on 9 June 2013. The current postulator for this cause is Father Micha≈Ç Jagosz.

SuAnne was featured in Ian Frazier's book On the Rez. Her basketball career was successful and dramatic: Big Crow made the last-second winning basket in the state Class A championship game. She was the best girl's player in South Dakota and scored an average of 39 points per game. Her 67 points in a single game was a state record. SuAnne died while traveling to accept a Miss Basketball Award during her senior year of high school. The SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club was created in 1992 and was the first Boys and Girls Club built in Indian Country. The center was named for SuAnne, who had wished for a \\"Happy Town\\" for children in her community. The Spirit of Su Award is given every year to an outstanding senior player who exemplifies the life of SuAnne Big Crow. The player is judged on outstanding athletic ability, leadership, character, sportsmanship and grade point average.

Folk Singer John McCutcheon was inspired by a story of SuAnne's courage to record the song \\"SuAnne Big Crow\\" on his 2007 album \\"This Fire.\\" The song tells the true story of the night that Big Crow's high school basketball team played in Lead, South Dakota in front of a gym full of fans screaming mockery of the Native American team, the Lady Thorpes. Big Crow startled them into silence by performing the Shawl Dance with her warm-up jacket and singing in Lakota in the middle of the court. Big Crow's teammate, Doni De Cory, states that in later years, the Lady Thorpes and the Lead women's basketball team got to know one another better: Big Crow had brought them together.

The book relates his experiences in prison after his arrest in 2003 by Russian authorities. Within his narrative he presents his critiques and concerns of modern Russian politics and civil society. Book Khodorkovsky, a businessman who at the time was the richest man in Russia and a harsh critic of the government of Vladimir Putin, was arrested on charges of fraud on October 25, 2003. He was put on trial in 2005 and then held in various Russian penal colonies for the next eight years. My Fellow Prisoners is an account of his life in prison. It focuses less on Khodorkovsky himself than on some of the people he met during his time in custody, including prison guards and fellow inmates. His objective is to paint a picture of life in a contemporary Russian prison in a variety of aspects and from a range of perspectives. The book consists of brief chapters, described in one review as ‚Äúsketches,‚Äù mostly three to five pages long. Some of the chapters of Khodorkovsky's book amount to brief portraits of his fellow inmates. Among them are Sergei, a railroad worker arrested for drug dealing; Kolya, a prisoner who, after being beaten by a guard ‚Äúopened himself up‚Äù in an act of ‚Äúfull-on hara-kiri,‚Äù causing his innards to spill out; Alexander, ‚Äúa real-life Nazi‚Äù who ‚Äúdoesn't believe in the Holocaust‚Äù; Alexei, imprisoned at age nineteen as a pedophile for having a relationship with a girl younger than himself; Artyom, a prisoner whom Khodorkovsky and other prisoners saved from a suicide attempt; Arkady, an orderly who ‚Äúworks as a 'tongue-loosener'‚Äù who tries to extract information about any crimes or accomplices the new arrival might have kept quiet about during his investigation.‚Äù Among the chapter titles are ‚ÄúThe Rat,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Father,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Addict,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Thief.‚Äù Khodorkovsky discusses the ‚Äúcaste of untouchables‚Äù in prison, including gays, rapists, and child abusers. He also examines the role and character of police, lawyers, and judges, saying that in the course of their work ‚Äúthey lie virtually all the time, and as a rule tell the truth only to gain someone's trust ‚Äì which then enables them to lie more successfully afterwards.‚Äù He describes the prison guards as ‚Äúembedding a criminal ideology‚Äù among prisoners, thereby ‚Äúeffectively training up the future foot-soldiers of the criminal world.‚Äù He also writes that although the investigator is supposed to act independently, he is, in fact, ‚Äújust a cog in the law-enforcement hierarchy ‚Äì a small-time bureaucrat who often doesn't even have a say in some of the key aspects of his work.‚Äù He states: ‚ÄúThe people who feel most uninhibited in prison are the police investigators.‚Äù Although his book consists largely of narrative and description, occasionally Khodorkovsky shares his reflections on such question as ‚Äúwhat is conscience? How do we define what is 'good', and what do we feel ashamed of for the rest of our lives? When does conscience overcome fear, and when does fear overrule conscience?‚Äù As an illustration of conscience overcoming fear, he writes about a fellow prisoner, Lyosha, who was bribed to tell lies against Khodorkovsky in court but who told the truth anyway. In the book, Khodorkovsky offers the observation that ‚Äúwhat takes place in prison‚Äù can sometimes seem ‚Äúlike a version of ordinary life beyond the prison gates, just taken to a grotesque extreme.‚Äù In addition, he states that he considers it likely ‚Äúthat over the next few years‚Äù Russians will find themselves ‚Äúliving in a bureaucratic-police state, with absolute power in the hands of a corrupt bureaucracy.‚Äù Reception John Lloyd, a reviewer for Financial Times, wrote that ‚Äúthe sketches in this new book are vivid, humane and poignant....Khodorkovsky‚Äôs testimony is that here is a corrupt system with little or no effort to do more than coop up the hopeless, the drug-addicted, the vicious ‚Äì and the occasional visionary. His vision is that Russia 'will ultimately take the road of European civilization'.... Khodorkovsky‚Äôs vision will take time ‚Äì and may be realised in harsher ways than he hopes.‚Äù John O'Malley in the Washington Post called Khodorkovsky's book an \\"illuminating and brave\\", noting that the stories accurately depict the state of Russian civil society caused by the years of political apathy and authoritarian rule. Roger Boyes of The Times gave a similar praise for My Fellow Prisoners describing the book as an accurate diagnosis of Russia's political struggles as evidenced by its symptoms, naming Khodorkovsky's \\"real crime\\" as failure to pledge feudal loyalty.

There were 87 vehicles involved in the pile-up in both directions of the divided highway, killing eight people and injuring a further 45. The crash, which was the most infamous in a slew of fatal crashes on the highway between Windsor and Chatham during the 1990s, led to significant improvements to that section. Background The section of Highway 401 between Windsor and London was constructed in stages in the 1950s and 1960s. It was an asphalt-paved highway carrying two lanes of traffic in each direction. Although parts of the highway had been constructed with several deliberate curves to reduce driver inattention, a stretch west of Tilbury was built following straight concession lines to minimize damage to the surrounding agricultural areas. The two carriageways were separated by a grass median, which was particularly narrow between Windsor and Tilbury as that section was the first built in 1955. That section of the highway also had soft gravel shoulders as per the original design. The straight road and flat, agricultural landscape were said to cause highway hypnosis and driver fatigue. The narrow grass median proved little obstacle in stopping vehicles from travelling into the opposing traffic carriageway, leading to several head-on collisions. The soft shoulders were also a factor in some accidents, where drivers who veered into the shoulder immediately over-corrected which often led to spin-outs and rollovers. Between Windsor and London, the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) had dubbed a 40-mile stretch as \\"Carnage Alley\\"; four were killed in 1997 and three died in 1998. In 1999 from March to September, 15 people had been killed and over 60 injured in 10 accidents between Windsor and Chatham-Kent, with the upcoming September 3 pile-up raising the death toll to 22 by the end of the year. Days before the crash in 1999, Ontario Minister of Transportation, David Turnbull, had travelled the portion of highway and called it \\"pleasant to drive\\". Pile-up on September 3 The 87-vehicle pile up on September 3, 1999 On the morning of Friday, September 3, 1999, a malfunction at the Windsor Airport Observation Station failed to detect foggy conditions, and no fog warnings were issued. The malfunction was not discovered until later. Around 8:00 am near the Manning Road overpass, a tractor-trailer entered a very dense fog patch and slowed suddenly, causing a following tractor-trailer to jack-knife. Reports indicated that the fog reduced visibility to less than . The initial crash set off a chain reaction of five further separate collisions, as other drivers unable to see the obstruction continued into the dense fog and colliding with crashed vehicles for several minutes. 87 vehicles were involved, many burnt and destroyed. Many people were injured in their vehicles or struck as they attempted to flee the pile-up. Seven people died at the scene and one more died later in hospital; 45 people were injured. The September 3 pile-up would occur 16 kilometers west of the stretch that the CAA had labelled as \\"Carnage Alley\\". There were collisions in both directions at that segment of Highway 401, although no vehicles crossed the highway's median. Sgt. B.G. Mailloux of the Ontario Provincial Police described the pile-up as \\"a massive fireball\\". Emergency services reported charred bodies inside vehicles, while several of the vehicles were unrecognizable and had to be traced by their registration numbers. In an area dubbed the \\"hot zone\\" or \\"fiery center\\", several vehicles were fused together. Traffic was temporarily rerouted on Highway 2 to the north and Highway 3 to the south, while Highway 401 had to be repaved before reopening to traffic. Safety improvements Immediately following the crash, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) installed paved shoulders with rumble strips and funded additional police to patrol the highway, a move criticized as being insufficient. The Canadian Automobile Association's (CAA) manager of public and government affairs, Nick Ferris, noted that while the September 3 crash was about 16 kilometers west of the \\"Carnage Alley\\" notorious stretch, he stated that \\"The conditions are similar. It just widened the kill zone\\". The CAA hired traffic experts to study the section, whose findings called for the replacement of the grass median with an additional traffic lane per direction (for three lanes in each direction) separated by a concrete median barrier. While the six-laning upgrade was part of the MTO's long-term plan for the entire highway and had been implemented for the London-Woodstock and Guelph-Milton sections in the early 1990s, at the time of the pile-up there was not sufficient funding nor traffic volumes for the Windsor-London section. A coroner's inquest into the crash led to 25 recommendations for safety improvements to the highway. These included increasing traffic enforcement and reintroducing photo radar, as well as a review of safety standards for highway construction based on current data. Public outrage from the crash led Turnbull to announce a plan for safer roads, including improvements to the stretch of highway west of London. In 2004, a $322 million plan of road improvements began east of Windsor, which included fully paved shoulders and a concrete median barrier, both with rumble strips, and reflective markers in curved sections. Construction on the improvements in Carnage Alley was completed between Windsor and Tilbury in 2010. In 2009 the MTO conducted an environmental assessment to widen the stretch of Highway 401 between Tilbury and London to six lanes, but as of 2016 no significant highway improvements had been made, due to its rural nature and long distance as well as lack of traffic. However, the narrow grass median remained prone to crossover collisions, especially in bad weather. In the Toronto Sun, Chatham-Kent Conservative MPP Rick Nicholls questioned if \\"it occurred to the MTO that a lot of drivers might be avoiding Carnage Alley precisely because it is so dangerous?\\" On August 29, 2017, a mother and daughter were killed in another cross-over collision on the unmodified stretch of the highway near Dutton, which drew renewed public outrage. Shortly afterwards the government announced plans to install a high-tension cable barrier in the grass median from Tilbury to Ridgetown. Advocates viewed the government's response as inadequate, and delivered a petition signed by 3,000 residents to Queen's Park demanding construction of a concrete barrier from Tilbury to London. In early 2018 the MTO committed to installing a concrete barrier on the stretch from Tilbury to London, with plans to install high-tension cables in the grass median as a short-term solution.

He played college football at Washington State University, and was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft. Early years and high school Cooper was born in Tacoma, Washington, in 1991 to Louis Cooper, Jr. and his wife, Dawn Cooper. His father works for the Port of Tacoma, and was a former NAIA football All-American at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. His mother is a social worker, and he has a sister, Keysha. Cooper was an athletic child, working out and playing sports at the local YMCA. Zachary Smalls, a friend of his father's and a former standout Washington State University football receiver in the 1980s, ran a speed and agility training camp for athletes 12 years old and up. Impressed with Cooper's speed, Smalls admitted the boy to his training camp even though Cooper was only 10 years old. Cooper's parents, both of whom have master's degrees, realized early on that their son had a moderate learning disability. His reading comprehension was minimal, and he learned best through kinesthetic learning (doing, experiencing, moving, or touching). Although Xavier was excited by sports, he was disinterested in school, so the Coopers allowed him to play sports only if he continued to go to school and study. Initially, he enjoyed AAU basketball and soccer, and was an excellent player due to his size and speed. He did not begin playing football until the ninth grade. Cooper's secondary education was at Woodrow Wilson High School in Tacoma. He played both basketball and football in high school, but excelled in football. Cooper began taking three special education classes in his freshman year. Nicknamed \\"X\\", Cooper was initially embarrassed by having to enroll in these courses, even though he had teammates sitting next to him in class. Although he overcame the embarrassment, he was taunted by his classmates. Despite his parents' encouragement, Cooper often skipped classes and his grades were poor. College football scouts, impressed with his athleticism, declined to recruit him, concluding that his academic struggles made him a high risk to drop out of college or fail to graduate. Cooper also did poorly on his ACT and SAT college admission exams. Cooper resolved to attend a junior college, until Mike Levenseller, a neighbor and former football coaching assistant at Washington State University (WSU), suggested \\"gray-shirting\\"‚Äîa process whereby Cooper would enroll at a Washington community college, taking classes that would enable him to enroll at WSU without passing entrance exams. Cooper subsequently enrolled at Tacoma Community College, which delayed his entry at WSU from September 2010 to January 2011. Cooper was angry that he had to sit out his 2010 season, but became reconciled to it. College career Cooper received a football scholarship from Washington State. He was redshirted at Washington State, attending classes, practicing with the football team, and dressing for play but not competing in games. He was strongly mentored by Heather Erwin, an academic advisor at WSU who worked extensively with Cooper to ensure that he went to classes, studied hard, discussed assignments with professors, asked for extra credit, and engaged in study habits that met his particular kinesthetic learning needs. By May 2015, Cooper was just eight credit hours short of a degree in criminal justice. (Cooper has said he intends to finish his college degree after his NFL rookie season, and then obtain a master's degree so that he can become a principal after his career ends.) As a redshirt freshman during the 2011 season, Cooper so impressed coaches with his dedication to practice that he was named an All-Pac-12 Conference honorable mention. During his sophomore year (2012 season), he started the last nine of the 12 games, and played (but did not start) in two more. During Cooper's junior year, he started all 13 games, helping make WSU the 10th-best defense in the nation. He made 13.5 tackles (3.5 of them against Idaho), and led Washington State in tackles-for-a-loss. Cooper was dominating during the 2014 season. He started all 12 games, made 37 tackles (9.5 of them for loss, best on the team), and had five sacks (second best on the team). During WSU's near-upset of the Oregon Ducks on September 20, 2014, Cooper had 1.5 sacks. Although Cooper had one more year of college eligibility left, he entered the 2015 NFL Draft. He totalled 121 career tackles, 31.5 of them for loss (the eighth highest number of tackles for a loss in WSU football history) and 13 career sacks. He forced three fumbles in three years, recovering two of them and returning one for a touchdown. Professional career Cooper attended the 2015 NFL Combine, where he helped his stock for the draft; by running the 40-yard dash in 4.86 seconds‚Äîthe fastest for a defensive lineman at the event. =Cleveland Browns= The Cleveland Browns drafted Cooper in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft.

He was beatified on 14 September 2013 after a healing was recognized as a miracle attributed to him. Cardinal Angelo Amato ‚Äì on the behalf of Pope Francis ‚Äì presided over the beatification. Another miracle under investigation was approved in 2016 and a date for canonization was approved in a gathering of cardinals on 15 March 2016; he was canonized as a saint on 16 October 2016. Life Brochero c. 1866. The urn containing Brochero's remains. Brochero was born on 16 March 1840 in Argentina as the fourth of ten children to Ignacio Brochero and Petrona Davila; he had two sisters and the others were brothers. Two sisters became nuns. He was baptized on 17 March along with the registration of his birth. He commenced his studies to become a priest at the College Seminary of Our Lady of Loreto on 5 March 1856 at the age of sixteen and during his studies he met the future president Miguel √Ångel Ju√°rez Celman. Brochero later received the tonsure on 16 July 1862. He was later received into the subdiaconate on 26 May 1866 and then into the diaconate on 21 September 1866. He had joined the Dominican Third Order on 26 August 1866. He was ordained to the priesthood in the diocese of C√≥rdoba on 4 November 1866 at the age of 26 under Bishop Jos√© Vicente Ram√≠rez de Arellano and celebrated his first Mass the following 10 December. Brochero was later appointed as a prefect of studies of the seminary and was awarded the title of Master of Philosophy on 12 November 1869. Brochero founded a home in 1875 for people known as the Houses of Exercises (inaugurated in 1877) and later established a school for girls in 1880. He requested and obtained from the authorities courier posts, post offices and telegraphic posts and also planned the rail network that would go through the Valley of Traslasierra joining Villa Dolores and Soto. He devoted all of his energy to those who required his help and no sick person was left devoid of the sacraments, as there was no force that could stop him helping them, and he had even said \\"woe if the devil is going to rob a soul from me\\". He was known to travel long distances in Argentina on the back of a mule dressed in a sombrero and a poncho to serve the needs of the Christian faith throughout his huge parish. He cared for the sick during the cholera epidemic of 1867 and contracted leprosy during his travels; it was believed that it came from drinking yerba mate with some of the patients with the affliction. He became well known to his parishioners and made efforts to improve all aspects of their involvement in church life. He became blind and deaf towards the end of his life. Throughout his travels to meet parishioners he would bring with him the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, his Mass kit and a prayer book. He was appointed to successive positions such as Canon of the Cathedral of C√≥rdoba on 24 April 1898. He left for that post on 30 May but was later appointed as a pastor in Villa del Transito on 25 August 1902, arriving there on the following 3 October. He resigned from his position as pastor on 5 February 1908 and returned the following 30 March back home to live with his sisters. Brochero died on 26 January 1914, his last words being: \\"Now I have everything ready for the journey\\". A Catholic newspaper later wrote of him: \\"It is known that Father Brochero contracted the sickness that took him to his tomb, because he visited at length and embraced an abandoned leper of the area\\". =Legacy= In Port-au-Prince in Haiti a rehabilitation clinic for the handicapped was opened in honor of Brochero, dubbed \\"Kay Gabriel\\" (Gabriel's House). Sainthood =Diocesan process and beatification= Bronchero c. 1910 Jos√© Gabriel Brochero riding his mule c. 1870‚Äì1880. The cause of beatification commenced on 17 March 1967 under Pope Paul VI in Argentina which gave him the title Servant of God; the actual process started in 1968 which saw the gathering of both documents and witness testimonies that pertained to his life and virtues. The Positio was submitted to Rome in 1997 in order for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to further evaluate the cause to determine whether or not it should proceed. Pope John Paul II recognized that the late priest lived a life of heroic virtue and named him to be Venerable on 19 April 2004. Pope Benedict XVI approved a miracle attributed to his intercession on 20 December 2012 which would allow for his beatification to take place. The miracle involved Nicolas Flores who was in a vegetative state after a severe car crash at the age of thirteen and was cured through the intercession of Brochero. Cardinal Angelo Amato ‚Äì on behalf of Pope Francis ‚Äì presided over the beatification in Argentina on 14 September 2013 and announced his feast would be celebrated on an annual basis on 16 March. Monument. Pope Francis ‚Äì in his Angelus address on 15 September to mark the occasion ‚Äì praised Brochero for his open heart to all and stated that \\"he knew the love of Jesus. He let his heart be touched by the mercy of God\\" which he extended to all people. The pope also said that Brochero was a man who \\"dedicated himself entirely to his flock\\" in order to evangelize to them and that the needs of the people came first as his sole focus. =Second miracle= Pilgrims present at the 2013 beatification for Brochero. It was suggested that Pope Francis could preside over the canonization in Cordoba in July 2016 during a possible apostolic visit to Argentina, though it would be celebrated in Rome if the visit did not go ahead. Since the pontiff's visit was rescheduled, the canonization would not take place in Argentina as was expected but would take place in Rome when it would be approved. The diocesan process for the second miracle ‚Äì the healing of a girl ‚Äì commenced on 16 July 2014 and concluded its business on 25 March 2015; the process received the formal decree of ratification on 28 March 2015. The miracle proceeded to the Medical Board in Rome on 10 September 2015 and was approved and theologians also approved the miracle on 3 November 2015. The congregation met to discuss the cause on 12 January 2016 and received its full approval. Pope Francis approved the second miracle attributed to Brochero on 21 January 2016 and confirmed the date of the late priest's canonization at a gathering of cardinals to be held on 15 March 2016; Brochero was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 October 2016 in Saint Peter's Square.

They left Bytown \\"walking out through the stumps of the Richmond Road, stopping for a mid-day meal at William Bell's tavern, spending the night at Billy Bradley's log tavern at Hazeldean, and proceeding to Stittsville the next day and then up the third line of Huntley\\". The Gourlays settled in the Huntley and March townships. John was ordained as a Presbyterian Minister and served as the first Presbyterian minister in Ashton. In 1851 he became the first settled minister of the Merivale Presbyterian Church and served the congregation there until 1868. It was written of him \\"Rev. Gourlay appears to have been both erudite and energetic. He is described as a diligent student of theology and a Hebrew and Greek scholar of note\\". In addition to Merivale (then known as Hopper‚Äôs Settlement), he later served congregations in Bell‚Äôs Corners, Goulbourn, and Aylmer, QC. In the early 1850s he was also a Superintendent of Schools in March Township. While in Aylmer, he served as chaplain of the Masonic Lodge. In Bell's Corners Gourlay acquired Lot 10, Concession 2, Ottawa Front. On 18 January 1862, Reverend Gourlay sold six acres in the west part of the lot to the Municipality of Nepean. On the same day, the municipality then sold the original road allowance between Lots 10 and 11, totalling 11 acres, to Reverend Gourlay. Seven years later the Reverend sold all his land to Robert Moodie on 24 March 1869. Moodie then sold part of an acre to Canada C.R.

History The Avard Sub was built by the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway (SLSF) also known as the Frisco. It was built in the late 1890s into the turn of the century. In the Frisco days it was separated by two subdivisions. From Tulsa to Perry, Oklahoma, was known as the Perry Sub, where it crossed the interlocking with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF). It paralleled the ATSF for about six miles and then the Frisco turned to the west. Then from Perry to Avard was known as Avard Sub. The ATSF had trackage rights on the subdivision because of ATSF's intermodal business from Los Angeles, CA, to Memphis, TN. In the early 1980s, nearly 100 years later, the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) merged and bought all of the Frisco. The ATSF still had trackage rights but the two subdivisions (Perry & Avard Subs) were combined into one to form all 177 miles of the Avard Sub. Then in 1995, the BN and the ATSF were merged to form the BNSF Railway. =1995 to present= After the merger the Avard Sub and all of its 100 years of existence, was track warrant control (TWC). There were no signals except at interlockings and between Black Bear (ATSF interlocking at Perry, OK), and just outside Perry. There was only about 20 to 30 trains a day operating on the Avard Sub, mostly intermodal traffic. Then in 2012, BNSF signed an agreement with Asian markets to have containers back in Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etc.), in 24 days. This meant more intermodal traffic. With the growing demands of crude oil and other general freight trains, BNSF was short on locomotives and train crews. It was crucial to upgrade the Avard Sub. CTC (centralized traffic control) and longer sidings were needed. In 2014 the Avard Sub was upgraded with CTC, PTC (positive train control), longer sidings, and a maximum speed of 70 mph for all qualified intermodal trains. In February 2018, BNSF announced their intention to add a new siding to the Avard Sub near Hopeton, OK. Trains There are several types of trains that run today on the Avard Sub. * Intermodal Trains (S, Q, & Z trains) * Freight (Manifest) Trains (H & M trains) * Unit Trains (Grain, corn syrup, and rock trains) Intermodals are good to run 70 mph, however there are a lot of permanent speed restrictions across the Avard.

E. Minchin, was a zoo administrator and artist in South Australia. History Minchin was the eighth son of Mary Anne (Wright) and the (Anglican) Rev. William Minchin, rector of Dunkerrin and owner of Greenhills or Greenhill, County Cork. The family sold up and left for various countries: Richard and his brother Henry Paul Minchin (1826‚Äì1909) left for South Australia on the Stag in 1850, with letters of introduction to Sheriff Charles Burton Newenham and pastoralist C. H. Bagot.E. J. Minchin, 'Minchin, Richard Ernest (1831‚Äì1893)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1974, accessed online 26 February 2015 Henry, who had studied law, was appointed Stipendiary Magistrate and Protector of Aborigines at Mount Remarkable (he later left for the tea plantations of India). Richard worked on one of Bagot's stations near Kapunda for a time, then around 1854 moved to Victoria, where he served as Clerk of Court at Bacchus Marsh. There he married Ellen Rebecca Ocock; they had their first child in Geelong in 1856. They returned to Adelaide, where he landed a clerical job with the Civil Service. A few years later he had risen to the position of draftsman with the Land Titles Office. Minchin became involved in the South Australian Acclimatization Society, founded by Chief Justice S. J. Way in 1878, and was appointed foundation secretary and treasurer. Members included Joseph Fisher, William Magarey, and Henry Scott of Mount Lofty, who had an extensive songbird collection, Together they fought to have a section of the Botanic Garden set aside as a zoological garden, which succeeded in August 1882, after having collected some 1500 signatures on a petition. Land near the Albert Bridge was allocated for a zoo, and Minchin was appointed its first director. The zoo was officially opened in May 1883 and Thomas Elder was appointed president of the Zoological Society of South Australia. He funded the purchase of an elephant, \\"Miss Siam\\", and the large rotunda. A lions were donated by Sir James Fergusson and J. H. Angas. They acquired a variety of other exotic animals and a pair of Tasmanian tigers. Minchin was sent to South East Asia on a purchasing expedition, and returned with a fine collection, and in 1889 was sent to Europe on a similar quest. On his return he settled into the newly established director's residence. He undertook one more trip, to Hong Kong, and there contracted a disease which left him an invalid, eventually forced to retire to Mount Barker, where he died ten days later. His son Alfred Corker Minchin succeeded him as director, serving for over forty years. Other activities Minchin was a skilled artist, and employed as a drawing master by Prince Alfred College, and also gave lessons in painting. He was a longtime member of the South Australian Society of Arts, and served as its secretary 1887‚Äì1892. Family Minchin was twice married: Ellen Rebecca Ocock (died 6 July 1882), daughter of a Victorian lawyer. They had three sons and six daughters, two of whom survived to adulthood: *Ernest William Minchin (1856 ‚Äì 24 May 1894) married Helen Victoria Kildahl on 20 May 1879 *Alfred Corker Minchin (24 September 1857 ‚Äì 20 September 1934) married Florence Euphemia Scammell on 9 October 1888.

The painting depicts a man on the American frontier, riding a large, brown, wild horse. The horse is obviously not trained because it is jumping and generally looking rowdy. In the background are many other men with horses, apparently on a cattle drive. Mountains are also visible in the distance, which perhaps leads the viewer to assume that this is the Goodnight-Loving Trail and the mountains are a string of the famous Sierra Nevada range. Throughout the painting, the color yellow is dominant to show the arid nature of the land. Remington's intention was to highlight such themes as self-reliance and mastery over nature. This painting measures 69 by 102 cm and currently resides at the American Museum of Western Art in Denver, Colorado. Man The man in the front middle of the painting is assumed to be a cowhand. He is wearing the traditional garb of a cowhand, including chaps, cowboy boots, and a canvas shirt. He is not wearing a hat, most likely due to the rowdiness of the horse, and the high probability that the hat fell off. He is sitting on a saddle and gives the impression of a very experienced rider; he clutches the reins with one hand and skillfully counterbalances by placing his other hand in the air. His fellow cowhands appear to be watching him with some concentration, though they are very distant and hard to see. Horse The horse appears to be a brown bay with a black mane and tail. It is jumping into the air, trying to buck off his unwelcome passenger. The horse's front legs are in the air and the muscles in his back legs are bulging. The horse has a white stripe on its face and appears to be full of life and strong. It is obviously a wild horse, trying to break free of captivity, while its rider is trying to calm and eventually tame it.

Trump, Tamales and the American Family (2020) Margaret's first non-fiction book. The book proposes that it's time to smash our culture of fear and follow the example of our World War II Greatest Generation, who built economies, exporting peace and prosperity throughout the world. Donnelly also suggests that we should invest in our American family--a family tree with roots and branches that stretch from the top of North America to the bottom of South America. It's time to join each other in a metaphorical kitchen, sharing resources and labor to produce a sacred meal, tamales, together, just as extended families of the Americas have been doing for ten thousand years. Bolivar's Heart (2015), her most recent novel, investigates Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's last wish while sharing a hidden world of human trafficking and indigenous oppression. Bolivar's heart, allegedly separated from his body during an autopsy, has been the focus of many folk tales. While most of these stories have never been welldocumented, they inspire millions in Venezuela, Colombia, Per√∫, Bolivia, and Ecuador all of whom look to Bol√≠var as their ‚Äúfather and protector.‚Äù This historical novel seeks to find the truth of what really happened to Bol√≠var's heart as it follows Isabel Condorcanqui, who attempts to kill herself as soon as a unit of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement surrounds the house where she's being held by Mexican smugglers. Isabel ends up in the psychiatric ward of a Dallas hospital after making manic accusations against authorities far removed from the scene, both chronologically and geographically. Peruvian officials, she says, had kidnapped her. Gloria Garc√≠a, a licensed attorney in Texas, and her boss, David Levin, must sort through her story to find out who Isabel really is as they try to save her from being deported back to Per√∫ As a passionate advocate of global education, author Margaret Donnelly taps into the Quechua version of what happened to Bol√≠var's heart in this thrilling story that weaves history with humanitarian, economic, and political issues of today. The Path of Lord Jaguar (2011). A sacred altar dedicated to Lord Jaguar in Chichen Itza protects the people of the Americas. According to the ancients, Lord Jaguar protects the path of life, or kuxan sum, so that the hemisphere will survive cataclysms that will soon befall the earth. Only a few are aware that the path gives instructions to those who will listen. In a dream, Pablo Balam is told that he must strengthen the path. To complete this task, he must build nine gardens that represent the nine Maya Underworlds in the fabulously wealthy estate for which he works. He's helped by Kemi. Not only do they share an intense physical connection, they also share a spiritual relationship grounded on their ancient religions. He's a Maya prayer man. She's a Nigerian priestess. Together, they must build the ninth garden before 2012 to repair the road that leads to the salvation of millions of people. Their quest, however, pushes them into a confrontation with evil that must be conquered at all cost. The Song of the Goldencocks (2006). After the end of World War II, high-ranking Nazi officials escaped Europe with the help of Argentina's Juan Domingo Peron in order to avoid the Nuremberg trials. While carting loot they stole from Holocaust victims, the officials spread their ruthless military tactics among Latin American paramilitary units, resulting in hundreds of thousands of kidnappings and deaths over the years. Forty-four years later, Ivan Trushenko, a young and na√Øve Venezuelan with a consuming passion for Cuban Communism, uncovers a long- hidden history when he mistakenly becomes involved with suspected Nazi war criminals. Accused of providing a false identity to a war criminal, Trushenko is interrogated under the harshest of circumstances and, after hours of torture, finally reveals a dark secret. When Matt Sheridan, a United States operative introduces Trushenko‚Äôs case to Alex Barclay, a popular army general known as the Goldencock, he is intrigued. Soon Barclay discovers an unexpected alliance between both left and right extremists who are hell-bent on achieving one goal‚Äîto monopolize Venezuela's oil-rich economy. Now the Goldencocks, true fighters who have already earned the respect of their community, are in a race against time in order to capture these criminals before they can overthrow the country. The Spirits of Venezuela (2005), signals the end of an age of taboos imposed in Venezuela by the Spanish Conquest and it opens the door to a new view of how Venezuelans interact with the practical wisdom of their ancestors. The author's account invites the reader to understand this hidden tradition from a broader and deeper perspective by sharing the real life experiences of hundreds of Venezuelans.

The channel is based in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt and funded by the Russian government. Similar to other RT channels, the neutrality and objectivity of RT France's information is regularly questioned. RT revealed in late 2015 its willingness to develop its TV network among the French-speaking audience in countries such as France, Belgium and Switzerland.http://www.lemonde.fr/actualite- medias/article/2015/10/06/la-chaine-russia-today-bientot-en- france_4783375_3236.html# The channel was launched on December 18, 2017, broadcasting in France, Belgium, Canada and the Mediterranean. Xenia Fedorova currently holds the position of President and News Director. The newsroom has 70 journalists and a technical staff of around 50. The channel, like other RT channels, cycles around 30 minutes of news and 30 minutes of other features, 24/7, and is able to provide rolling coverage on breaking news events when warranted.  Assessments and responses  The political science researcher Maxime Audinet discussed the neutrality of RT France by stating: \\"Today it's not easy at all to find \\"fake news\\", or at least gross attempts at misinformation on the sites of RT, for example. They certainly have a conspiratorial past, but it definitely seems more interesting to observe the nature of their editorial line, which is highly selective and consistent with the Moscow-based view of the world.\\" In 2017, current French president Emmanuel Macron accused RT France of spreading \\"propaganda\\" during his 2017 presidential campaign and banned RT reporters from his campaign headquarters. He described the channel as a tool for \\"influence-peddling.\\" On June 28, 2018, RT France was found in breach by the CSA for \\"failures of honesty, the rigor of the information and the diversity of the viewpoints\\" in a subject on the Syria. In a topic broadcast on April 13, \\"disputing the reality of chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian city of Douma\\", the CSA observed that the channel \\"had not faithfully translated comments of Syrian witnesses\\". The CSA imposed no sanctions on RT, but the regulator has the authority to fine a broadcaster or suspend its licence. However, RT acknowledged that these actual words were spoken by the witness, but in a longer version of the interview that was not broadcast on air. RT France then apologized for the technical error, claiming \\"not to have invented a piece of evidence by means of a deliberately fraudulent translation as many media believe\\" with evidence as full testimony. Its president Xenia Fedorova claimed that \\"RT France covers all subjects, including the Syrian conflict, in a totally balanced manner, by giving all sides a chance to comment.\\" As a result, RT France appealed a week later to the Conseil d'√âtat to overturn the decision of the CSA. On July 18, 2018, the Syndicat national des journalistes (SNJ) wrote a blog stating that RT France journalists were denied access on numerous occasions to cover major events, such as presidential elections. The main reason was that \\"RT is regularly blamed at the highest level as a tool for propaganda and misinformation.\\" On October 17, 2018, during an interview with a Puremedia journalist, French government spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux, re-stated the state's refusal to open its press room to RT France and Sputnik, saying: \\"They are not news organizations. They are propaganda funded by a foreign state.\\" In November 2018, RT France was accredited to allow access to some Elys√©e press conferences. But in February 2019, LREM refused to allow the channel to cover its European campaigns, on the basis that RT and Sputnik, \\"are not news organizations but propaganda in the service of the Kremlin. They should not be considered to be media, since they do not verify or cross-check information\\". Despite constant claims and attacks due to propaganda and misinformation, RT France continues to be seen by viewers as an objective and neutral 24-hour news outlet. Some has even preferred it over BFMTV and CNews. During the yellow vests movement, RT France chose to provide a different style of reporting than the aforesaid channels, focusing heavily on on-the-ground reporting, including many unedited interviews with protestors, and eschewing so-called \\"talking heads\\". RT's coverage on YouTube gathered around 23 million views, twice that of Le Monde, L‚ÄôObs, France 24, Le Figaro and LeHuffPost combined. At least 14 journalists, one-fifth of the channel's entire team of journalists, suffered injuries in some way while covering the movement. It is later noted that they have praised RT France for giving them a platform to express their opinions, while at the same time, criticizing other mainstream channels due to too much in-studio analysis and \\"censorship\\" of the reporting style.

An American and British co-production, it is based on the 2013 video game of the same name, with some elements of its sequel by Crystal Dynamics, and is a reboot of the Tomb Raider film series. The film stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, who embarks on a perilous journey to her father's last-known destination, hoping to solve the mystery of his disappearance. Dominic West, Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas appear in supporting roles. Principal photography lasted from January to June 2017, and took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire, England, and in Cape Town, South Africa. The first Tomb Raider film not to be distributed by Paramount Pictures, it was released in the United Kingdom on March 14, 2018, and in the United States on March 16, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures, in RealD 3D, IMAX 3D, IMAX, and 4DX. The film grossed $274 million worldwide, the same as the 2001 film of the same name and more than its 2003 sequel. Tomb Raider received mixed reviews from critics, with some describing the plot as paint \\"by-the-numbers\\", and others praising the action sequences, tone, grittiness and realistic take on the franchise. Vikander's performance and the characterization of Croft drew a polarized response; some described her as a \\"capable, powerful, and unobjectified heroine\\", while others called her bland, and a \\"punching bag and onlooker.\\" A sequel is scheduled to be released on March 19, 2021.  Plot  Following the disappearance of her father, Lord Richard Croft, Lara Croft makes a living as a bike courier. When she is arrested after a bike accident involving a police car, Richard's business partner Ana Miller posts her bail. Lara has never claimed her inheritance for many years as she believes her father to still be alive, but Miller warns Lara that if she does not claim it, her father's country estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb. There she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into Himiko, the mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy all of his research, but she ignores his warnings so that she can investigate further. Lara travels to Hong Kong where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship Endurance, to sail into the Devil's Sea and the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She awakens only to encounter Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity, which seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Vogel takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and revealing that he intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu Ren to his slave force; eventually, the two of them try to escape, and Lara is the only one successful. After surviving rapids and narrowly avoiding going over a waterfall with the wreck of a wartime airplane, Lara is forced to kill a Trinity guard after nightfall. She follows a mysterious figure through the jungle, and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off the next morning to steal Vogel's satellite phone. Lara makes contact with Lu Ren, and he, along with the other slaves, stage a distraction that allows Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and take the phone. In the ensuing chaos, Lu Ren commandeers an assault rifle, provides cover for the escapees and guns down several Trinity soldiers, while Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb and is captured by Vogel, who persuades Lara to open the tomb, something she has prepared for since she was a child. At that point, the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away, thus enabling the party to enter that which has not been seen for at least two thousand years. The party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's sarcophagus. When a Trinity soldier attempts to remove her corpse, he is infected by a highly infectious pathogen that reduces those infected to an aggressive zombie-like state. Lara realizes that Himiko was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, who chose to entomb herself so that she could not infect others. Vogel concludes that he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for detaching a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, although Vogel escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Vogel as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts and kills Vogel by infecting him with the finger. She escapes the tomb as it collapses, regrouping with Lu Ren and the slaves; they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai. Lara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's front company, Patna, is actually a subsidiary of Croft Holdings. She proceeds to investigate Trinity further and begins to suspect that Ana is one of their agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance; this was to have Lara sign over control of Croft Holdings' business operations to her when Richard stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity's ruthlessness firsthand, she prepares for her next adventure. In a mid-credits scene, Lara returns to Alan's pawn shop to buy back her pendant and decides to take two identical pistols.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Tomb Raider reboots the franchise with a more grounded approach and a star who's clearly more than up to the task‚Äîneither of which are well served by an uninspired origin story.\\" At the time of its release, it was the best- reviewed movie based on a video game on the site. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by the 2001 film; PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 70% positive score. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, \\"The Lara Croft reboot Tomb Raider isn‚Äôt half bad for an hour. Then there‚Äôs another hour. That hour is quite bad. It‚Äôs no fun watching your action heroine get shoved, punched and kicked to the sidelines of her own movie, while the menfolk take over and take turns overacting before expiring.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the story but praising Vikander, and writing, \\"When all the one-dimensional supporting characters and familiar action moves fall by the wayside, the one thing left standing is Vikander...The film strains credulity even for a vid-game fantasy by letting the leading lady recover awfully quickly from bad injuries, but other than that Vikander commands attention and is the element here that makes Tomb Raider sort of watchable.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it 2 out of 5, and wrote: \\"Throughout Vikander maintains a kind of serene evenness of manner. Blandness is Lara‚Äôs theme.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the film, saying that \\"The exciting surprise of the new Tomb Raider, directed by the Norwegian genre specialist Roar Uthaug, is that it doesn‚Äôt tamp down Vikander‚Äôs inner flame, or the three-dimensionality of her talent; it doesn‚Äôt fold and insert her into an overly gymnastic and CGI-happy thrill ride. The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that‚Äôs been expertly tailored to its star‚Äôs understated directness.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and said, \\"this is a beautifully crafted and unpretentious piece of action cinema, with a number of sequences that are as gorgeous as they are thrilling, and a female hero who's as elegant as she is deadly: an ass-kicking Audrey Hepburn.\\" IndieWire's Anne Thompson wrote that Tomb Raider \\"was a well-mounted, intelligently wrought adventure, more grounded in the real world than its fantasy predecessors\\" and that \\"it establishes the action bonafides of both Vikander and director Roar Uthaug\\". =Accolades= At the 2018 Teen Choice Awards, the film received nominations for \\"Choice Action Movie\\" and for Alicia Vikander as \\"Choice Action Movie Actress,\\" but lost both to Avengers: Infinity War and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War, respectively.  Future  In 2015, Adrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman films, stated that he hoped to oversee a shared universe of Square Enix films with Just Cause, Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, and Thief, but admitted that he does not have the rights to Tomb Raider. Prior to the release of the first film, Alicia Vikander expressed interest in returning as Lara Croft for a second film, stating that \\"If there's an audience out there for it, then I would love to\\". In April 2019, Amy Jump was hired to write a script for a possible sequel, with Vikander attached. In September 2019, Ben Wheatley, Jump's husband, signed on to direct the sequel, with a planned March 19, 2021 release date, with Warner Bros. Pictures dropping out of the project. That same month, it was confirmed that Wheatley's long-time cinematographer Laurie Rose will also work on the film. It was announced that filming will start in early 2020 in England. According to Geek Vibes Nation, principal photography was scheduled to start in April with filming taking place across a number of countries including England, South Africa, Finland and China and looking to deliver a faithful adaptation of the games' story. The movie will allegedly be embracing more of the supernatural elements and tones that gamers have connected with. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was delayed until summer of 2020, with filming taking place in England and South Africa.

It was released on YouTube and Vimeo on February 23, 2015. It is based on the franchise of the same name. Plot The Machine Empire defeats the Power Rangers in battle, destroying the Megazord. It is revealed that Earth's governments then negotiate a truce with the Machine Empire and the Power Rangers are disbanded. Years later, Rocky, the second Red Ranger has defected to the Machine Empire, critical of Zordon's use of Power Rangers as child soldiers, and now sports a prosthetic leg. He interrogates a restrained Kimberly, the former Pink Ranger, about the location of Tommy Oliver, the former Green Ranger. He details the fates of the other Rangers in flashback. Jason, Rocky's predecessor as Red Ranger, was gunned down eight hours after marrying Kimberly, when Bulk and Skull seemingly revealed their location to a police force; Zack, the former Black Ranger, was an insatiable action junkie who became a Machine Empire enforcer (seen taking down the North Korean Kim and his goons personally) before being caught; Billy Cranston, the former Blue Ranger, became an openly-gay trillionaire who ended up buying Lockheed Martin and was found dead of an apparent suicide. Kimberly rejects Rocky's claim that Tommy is hunting down the Rangers. She tells Rocky that she hasn't seen him since the funeral of Trini, the former Yellow Ranger who died at the treaty negotiations. Rocky acknowledges that he already knew that; she is really being held as bait. Tommy arrives and kills the guards, entering into single combat against Rocky in a sword duel. When Rocky gains the upper hand, Kimberly shoots and kills him. Tommy demands to know who she is, as the real Kimberly died in his arms during the final battle years earlier. The fake Kimberly's fa√ßade crumbles to reveal Rita Repulsa, who killed all the others: she injected Jason with poison during the shootout and assassinated Billy and Zack with shots to the back of the head. Rita attempts to lure Tommy into her plan of world domination (noting that she created him) but he denies her, attacking her as the film ends. Several of the plot points make references to real-life incidents in the original Power Rangers actors' lives: David Yost, who played Billy, came out as gay after the series ended, while Thuy Trang, who played Trini, died in an automobile accident in 2001.

Two versions of the film were released; the version hosted on Vimeo included brief nudity not present in the YouTube version. =Critical reception= Members of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers praised it, such as Austin St. John, Amy Jo Johnson and Steve Cardenas. Jason David Frank, the original Green Ranger, criticized the short film, thinking it was too violent and the fact the Power Rangers franchise is still being produced for children. However, he appreciated it on an \\"inner geek level\\". =Removal by Saban and restoration= On February 24, 2015, Vimeo chose Power/Rangers as a \\"Staff Pick\\".

It is commonly known as fragrant screw-pine. Names In addition to screw-pine, other common English names for the tree include kewda, fragrant screwpine, umbrella tree and screw tree.\\"Kewda\\". FlowersOfIndia.net. Retrieved 25 July 2016. In India, the tree goes by a variety of names, many deriving from the Sanskrit kƒìtakƒ´ (). In Tamil, it is called kaithai (‡Æï‡Øà‡Æ§‡Øà) and thazhai (‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Øà) and both are mentioned in Sangam literature. In Arabic speaking countries, the tree is referred to as al-kƒÅdi ().J.R.I. Wood, A Handbook of the Yemen Flora, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew 1997, p. 315 In Japan, the tree is called adan () and grows on Okinawa. Pandanus odorifer grows widely at the St. Martin Island of Bangladesh, although much have been destroyed by mass tourism initiative. Description It is a small branched, palm-like dioecious tree with a flexuous trunk supported by brace roots. The tree can grow to a height of 4 meters. Leaves grow in clusters at the branch tips, with rosettes of sword- shaped, stiff (leather-like) and spiny bluish-green, fragrant leaves. Leaves are glaucous, 40‚Äì70 cm. long. In summer, the tree bears very fragrant flowers, used as perfume. In Yemen, they are predominantly found alongside flowing streams in the western escarpment foothills; Most common in high rainfall areas.Abdul Wali A. al-Khulaidi, Flora of Yemen, Sustainable Environmental Management Program (YEM/97/100), Republic of Yemen, June 2000, pp. 13, 149. The fragrant male flowers are wrapped in leaves and sold on roadsides and in markets. Only male plants seem to occur in Yemen. Some suggest that it was introduced into Yemen from India where its flowers are used chiefly to make perfume. Propagation The tree is propagated vegetatively, by the offshoots of young plants that grow around the base of the trunk, but may also be increased by seed. If by the former method, the offsets should be cut off and set in sand, at a temperature of 65¬∞ or 70¬∞. The cuttings root slowly and the plants for a time make very slow growth. The general cultural treatment is that of palms. Trees require an abundance of water in summer.L.H. Bailey, Manual of Gardening (2nd edition), New York 1910, Chapter VIII: The Growing of the Ornamental Plants ‚Äì Instructions of Particular Kinds, s.v. Pandanus. Other uses An aromatic oil (kevda oil) and fragrant distillate (otto) called keorra-ka-arak are extracted from the male flowers. They are almost exclusively used in the form of a watery distillate called kewra water. Flowers have a sweet, perfumed odor that has a pleasant quality similar to rose flowers, although kewra is considered more fruity. The distillate (kewra water, pandanus flower water) is quite diluted- it can be used by the teaspoon, often even by the tablespoon.

The train began operations in 2014 and transports tourists from Seoul to train terminals closest to the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Overview The first train opened on May 4, 2014, and travels on the Gyeongui Line, in South Korea's northwest, running from Seoul Station to Dorasan Station. The train crosses the Imjingang Railroad Bridge on the Imjin River and arrives in Paju, Gyeonggi close to the DMZ. The North Korean city of Kaesong, where the defunct Kaesong industrial park is located, is away. At the Imjingang Station passengers must debark for an identification check and head count because Dorasan is the only train station located within the civilian-restricted area. The DMZ train ended a four-year break of passenger service to Dorasan Station, started in April 2002 under the Sunshine Policy, and suspended by the Ministry of National Defense in 2010 after a person attempted crossing the DMZ into North Korea. The station is from Pyongyang and from Seoul and a sign there reads, \\"This is not the last station from the South, but the first station toward the North\\". Some tourist activities at the final stop are bus and walking tours to the Dorasan Peace Park, the Third Tunnel, and the Dora Observatory. The second route opened on August 1, 2014, and travels on the Gyeongwon Line northeast from Seoul Station to Baengmagoji Station, in Cheorwon County, Gangwon-do. It is the last station currently open on that line, followed by the now closed Woljeong-ri Station in the DMZ, where visitors may tour, and Wonsan Station, now located in North Korea, where trains used to arrive from Seoul in the early 20th century, but stopped after Korea's division. Some other off-train tour visits are White Horse Hill and Cheorwon Peace Observatory. DMZ Train interior Imjingang Railroad Bridge The train has three themed cars: \\"Peace Car\\" with a rusty steam train motif symbolizing the separation of the Korean peninsula, \\"Harmony Car\\", with paintings of red and blue figurines holding hands, and \\"Love Car\\" with paintings of adults and children from across the globe, also, holding hands. Inside the cars, ceilings are covered with pinwheels, and walls display photographs of the DMZ, with themes of war, trains, and ecology. Reception Soon after the opening of the first route to Dorasan Station, on June 11, 2014, Song In-geol of The Hankyoreh reported ridership of around 10,000 for the first month, and the trip's significance, \\"...for South Koreans who moved here from the North, it is the road home, as well as memory lane; for young people and families, it is a way to experience the separation of the peninsula; for visitors from overseas, it is a journey motivated by curiosity\\". In July 2017, BBC News journalist Steve Evans called it \\"one of the most bizarre train journeys in the world\\", and said, \\"It is a political journey, it is designed to make the point that the train goes and can go no further\\".

Pastoral care is entrusted to the Priests of the Sacred Heart. Like other Finnish Catholic parishes, which are all part of the Diocese of Helsinki, the area served by the parish is broad, stretching from the western extent of Uusimaa to Riihim√§ki to Hanko. The parish area includes the diocesan retreat center, Stella Maris; the diocesan broadcaster, Redemptoris Mater; and the Carmelite convent in Espoo. The vast majority of parishioners reside in Greater Helsinki, including many foreigners; regular services are held in Swedish, English, Vietnamese, Polish, Spanish, and German as well as Finnish. St. Mary's was established in 1954, the second Catholic congregation in the western Helsinki area to be established since the Protestant Reformation. Bishop Willem Cobben consecrated the parish church on December 6, 1954, whose facilities include a church hall and rectory. A parochial school was opened the same year.  Parish church  The church was designed by architect Kaj Salenius in the Modern style. The sanctuary is flanked by paintings of the patroness, the Virgin Mary, in depictions of the Woman of the Apocalypse and of the Assumption of Mary. These, along with the baptismal font, window paintings, and statue of Mary were created by the Dutch artist Lou Manche. The statue is a Madonna in the form of a Seat of Wisdom and carved from stone. The current altar, set in the middle of the chancel, contains relics of Saint Bridget of Sweden and of her daughter Saint Catherine of Sweden. The old altar, set against the wall, contains relics of Saint Pius X, Saint Christopher, and Saint Maria Goretti. The altar wall, contributed in 1985, is a natural stone mosaic by German artist Claus Kilian of the Crucifixion of Jesus, surrounded by the Four Evangelists. In the rear of the church is a mechanical two-manual organ with seventeen registers by Swedish artist Richard Jacoby in 1965. The bell tower has three bells which are rung on Sundays before Mass and on special occasions.

It is very prickly, with a large number of spherical, yellow flower heads. Description Melaleuca pungens grows to about high and wide. The leaves are nearly linear, long and about wide, lack a stalk, spread in all directions and have a small, sharp point on the end making the plant exceptionally prickly. New growth is silky. The bright yellow flowers appear in September and October, are numerous and in rounded or elongated heads about wide. The leaves and flower stalks are covered with fine, soft hairs. The fruit are fused together in clusters, wide. Corrigin Nature Reserve Taxonomy Melaleuca pungens was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (pungens) is from the Latin pungens meaning \\"sharp\\", \\"acrid\\", \\"piercing\\" or \\"biting\\". Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pungens occurs in the south western corner of Western Australia in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy soils, gravel, laterite and granite on hillsides and flats. Cultivation Melaleuca pungens adapts well to temperate areas with well-drained, acidic to neutral soils. It is frost hardy and can be grown readily from cuttings.

I would go to the theater a lot and listen to all that great music from different shows.\\" The first four of his Mercury titles had respectable chart runs in Billboard,. but the most recent of them, Ol√© was the first not to make the magazine's list of (what was now) the top 150 albums of the week. since his 1956 Columbia debut. In the liner notes for the 2012 release of Broadway, James Ritz describes how \\"John swings unabashedly and unrelentingly thanks to Allyn Ferguson, who outdid himself with a set of wild and uninhibited arrangements.\\" Mathis has fond memories of the arranger/conductor: \\"Great stuff... lots of interesting rhythm patterns from Allyn. He was a taskmaster. He was very, very smart and he always put that into his music. He was very esoteric as far as his jazz was concerned. I just sort of tagged along. I enjoyed the challenge and vocally I think it worked. I was quite enamored at the time with Lena Horne and I think a lot of it reflects that.\\" AllMusic reviewer Al Campbell explains, \\"At the time, Mercury felt the album was too upbeat and not the type of romantic material Mathis had been so successful with during his previous tenure with Columbia.\\" Track listing # \\"Ain't It de Truth\\" from Jamaica (Harold Arlen, E.Y.

The film follows Leon, a waiter at a table d'hote restaurant who is in love with Rosa, a French cashier at the same restaurant. Leon goes on vacation and poses as a foreign noble, attracts the interest of Violet Hope's mother as a suitable candidate to marry her daughter. While at the beach, Leon is knocked over by a breaking wave and Violet rescues him, earning Leon's gratitude. Rosa arrives after tracking Leon down and forces him to confess and return to the restaurant. Violet's mother then allows her daughter to marry the man of her choice. No cast or staff credits are known for the production. The film was released on October 4, 1910, and was met with praise by the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 8, 1910. It states: \\"Leon is a waiter in a cheap table d'hote restaurant and makes desperate love to the fat French cashier, Rosa. Off on his vacation, Leon decides to pose as a foreign nobleman. At a seaside hotel where he stops, he becomes all the rage. One of the guests at the same hotel is a beautiful young heiress, a Violet Hope, whose designing mother at once conceives the idea of marrying her off to the supposed count. The plan does not meet with Violet's approval, she is already in love with a native born. One day while bathing in the surf, Violet, who is an expert swimmer, comes to the assistance of the bogus count, who has been knocked over by a breaker, and delivers him safely into the hands of the lifeguard. The count at once lays his life and fortune at Violet's feet, greatly to that young lady's disgust and her mother's delight. In the meantime Rosa becomes acquainted with the doings of her absent lover and traces him to the beach. Finding him in the water, and beyond her reach, Rosa also dons a bathing suit and after a chase through the waves, captures Leon and forces him to confess that he has been sailing under false colors. He was led back to the restaurant by the triumphant Rosa, while Violet obtains her mother's consent to wed the man of her choice.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.  Release and reception  The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 4, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with theaters showing the film in South Dakota, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Washington, Kansas, Maryland, and New Hampshire. The film review by Walton of The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World bear an unusual expression about laying siege to an heiress that is used in both summaries. Bowers says both reviews were probably adapted from a \\"canned\\" review supplied by Thanhouser. Though it is uncertain if the review by The Moving Picture World which was issued on October 15 was picked up and reused by The Moving Picture News for the November 5 edition. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer offered praise for the production in its summary, \\"The Thanhouser players get considerable humor out of this comedy which is quite cleverly constructed and well acted. Leon is a waiter in a table d'hote restaurant. He bids his fat sweetheart, the restaurant cashier, good-bye and goes on his vacation, stopping at a seaside resort where he poses as a foreign count, captivates the ladies, and finds a rich mamma who wants to marry him to her daughter. The engagement gets into the papers, his fat sweetheart in town reads the news and takes the next train to the seaside hotel, where she makes short work of Leon, leading him off by the ear, to the great delight of the rich girl and her American lover. Amusing by-play is worked in, and the film pleases.\\" An advertisement for the Jewel Theatre in Winfield Daily Free Press claimed it to be better than Home Made Mince Pie.

His most successful work was his Pictorial Outline of Japanese History series of triptychs in the late 1880s. He was jailed and fined in 1889 for caricaturing the Meiji Emperor. Life and career Ichikawa Hachiƒìmon (1874), from the series '''' Few details of Gink≈ç's birth and early life are known; his birth name was Adachi Heishichi.

Gink≈ç may have begun designing ukiyo-e woodblock prints as early as 1870, though these purported prints of the Boshin War have not survived. Gink≈ç's earliest surviving prints date to 1873‚Äîa number of yakusha-e prints of actors in the style of Toyohara Kunichika. He published his early work under the art name Sh≈çsetsusai Gink≈ç. He found success with a series of actor prints titled Complete Issue of Top Battle Stories in 1874. Later that year he began using the art name Adachi Gink≈ç. Gink≈ç produced in a variety of genres, including bijin-ga portraits of beauties, landscapes, book illustrations, and satirical works. A large number of his works dealt with contemporary events such as the Satsuma Rebellion and the First Sino-Japanese War. His most popular work was the series of triptychs Pictorial Outline of Japanese History, published from 1185 to 1889.

The design is attributed to Agnolo di Ventura.Artistic Guide to Siena and Its Environs, Societa Editrice Fiorentina, Florence (1908), page 28. The portal has three rounded arches, with a larger central travertine marble arch. The flanking guardhouses have crenellated roofs. The external central arch is surmounted by a round marble relief of the Roman Catholic IHS Christogram in a Sun. The interior wall has an icon of the Madonna.

Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 8, 1910. It states: \\"John Warren, a prosperous young clerk, is run down by a taxi cab while crossing a city street. The chauffeur, Allen, afraid of the consequences of his carelessness, makes his escape when he sees a crowd gathering around his victim. He abandons his machine on a lonely country road, and catching a westbound train, succeeds in making good his escape. Six years later finds John, now a cripple, living in a mining town with his devoted wife. Here John, incapacitated from other work, lives out a miserable existence as the timekeeper at the mine. Here, also, Allen comes, applying for work as a miner. They do not recognize each other. John, poor and ill, is visited by another misfortune. His beloved wife, who has clung to him through all the years of his adversity, sickens and dies. His one joy in life is taken from him. John refuses to be comforted by Allen, who feels deep sympathy for the poor cripple. While reciting his sad history to Allen, John learns for the first time that Allen is the man who, by crippling him, wrecked his life. At last the vengeance he has sought all these years is within his reach. He raises his gun to end Allen's existence, when a vision of his wife appears, breathing the message, 'Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord.' John rushes from the house to the grave of his loved one, and there, after forgiving Allen, dies at peace with mankind.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. In one scene, the appearance of the wife was described as being facilitated by \\"trick printing\\", and was possibly created by a double exposure. Bowers notes that the sister was listed as the wife in the official synopsis, but it is unlikely that such a distinction in cast roles was ever made in the inter-titles due to the confusion. Bowers stated that names were used in to keep track of who was who, but patrons were unaware of the characters' names. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 7, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, Maryland, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Minnesota. The film received negative reviews in trade publications and it was deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases. The film's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character's misery. In response to the illogical plot, The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, \\"Why the cripple should go West as soon as he is able to hobble isn't clear; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces haziness of reasoning.\\" The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen, who originally fled, would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John. The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd. The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively, \\"Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence; but it has no other reason. It is not entertaining. It is not instructive. It cannot amuse. The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor. It is such a departure from the usual Thanhouser that it seems as though the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company's censor.\\" Advertisers for the film listed it in a variety of ways from a strong drama to having real mining activities. The film is presumed lost.

It is located on Via Cassia in Siena, region of Tuscany, Italy. The gate exits near the Basilica of San Clemente and leads south out of town to Via Enea Silvio Piccolomini. Porta Romana History The gate was built in 1327-1328 by Agnolo di VenturaArtistic Guide to Siena and Its Environs, Societa Editrice Fiorentina, Florence (1908), page 28. and Agostino di Giovanni, and has a crenellated roofline with machicolation in front gate. The gate is complex, with two separate portals, separated by a small inner court, with the inner gatehouse taller than the outer one. The large arches are faced with travertine marble. The courtyard is surrounded by arrowslits. It was likely that the gate doors could be opened sequentially. The outer portal has a round bas-relief with the Roman Catholic IHS Christogram inside a sun symbol (San Bernardino Christogram). In 1417, Taddeo di Bartolo was commissioned to paint the Madonna icon on the inner portal, dedicated to the protection of the city. The painting was further retouched by Sassetta and later Sano di Pietro who completed it in 1466. The painting depicted a Glory of Angels in lower arches, and a Coronation of the Virgin in the central arch. Due to the state of decay, the remaining fresco was transferred in 1978 to the Basilica of San Francesco, Siena. Bibliography *Toscana.

A performance of it lasts about 11 minutes. History Ventanas was Revueltas's third orchestral work, composed immediately after the first versions of Cuauhn√°huac and Esquinas, and concurrently with the second, large-orchestral version of Cuauhn√°huac and the Duo para Pato y Canario. It was completed in December 1931 and premiered on 4 November 1932 by the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Mexico under the composer's direction (; ). Although not so indicated in the published score, Revueltas dedicated Ventanas to √Ångela Acevedo, whom he married in the year of its premiere . Instrumentation Ventanas is scored for an orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, E clarinet, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, and strings. Programmatic content Mexican windows (ventanas) In one programme note, Revueltas gave a rather conventional programmatic description: \\"Ventanas is sharply romantic music. Who does not remember a window by the light of the moon, or without it?\\" . In another, better-known one, however, he demurred: Analysis Like Planos, Ventanas is exceptional among Revueltas's single-movement works in that it does not fall into a three- part structural pattern but rather is formally free and through-composed . Ventanas, characteristic of Revueltas's style, employs pedal tones and ostinatos as bases for musical constructions which usually are accumulations of rhythms and instrumental textures. Broadly melodic sections contrast with others in which small motives are developed rhythmically. These fragmentary motives recall folk music, often as melodies in parallel thirds. The harmonic texture is mostly open rather than dense, despite chromatic melodic movement, and there are frequent hints of bitonality. Fifths and octaves anchor the strongly etched melodic contours and active harmonic rhythms. In the scoring, Revueltas displays a fondness for the low brass, especially the tuba, which also has a prominent role in many of Revueltas's other works, such as Sensemay√°, Homenaje a Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, El renacuajo paseador, Troka, and Alcanc√≠as. Rhythmic complexity is also a feature, with constantly changing rhythms and meters (; ). The music \\"never stands still (except when the composer intends so, always to maximum effect; these episodes are felt both as moments of melodic statement and rhythmic repose)\\" . Reception As an instance of Revueltas's harsher, more abstract, and modernist style Ventanas, as also Esquinas were poorly received by audiences, in contrast to his more lyrical and tonal examples, such as Colorines and Janitzio, were warmly praised . On 8 September 1944, Aaron Copland wrote, in a letter to Arthur Berger from Tepoztl√°n, Mexico: A 1999 review of Esa-Pekka Salonen's recording rates Ventanas somewhat higher, as a \\"minor masterpiece\\", in fact, describing it as cinematic and rhapsodic with primitive, ritualistic episodes recalling Sensemay√°, but also with \\"delightful interludes in the Mexican folk style, a blues-tinged oboe theme, impassioned violins, and a drunken, orgiastic coda that builds to an appropriately festive climax\\" . The work has been interpreted as an example of Revueltas's representation of Mexican society, in which different cultural, ethnic, and social-class differences do not coexist peacefully, much less are brought into a harmonious or even dialectical synthesis. Although the music \\"sometimes clearly celebrates the plurality and vitality of Mexican society, the audible violence of the music, more openly in some pieces than in others, acknowledges clear conflicts among cultures and between premodern and modern social structures with their associated class configurations\\" .

Margaret Graham is in the back row, first on the left. Margaret Graham (5 June 1889 ‚Äì 25 January 1966) was an Australian kindergarten teacher and radio presenter known for voicing the radio program Kindergarten of the Air.  Early years and education  Born to Scottish parents Maggie MacKeddie and John Graham in Ballarat, Victoria, Margaret was the fourth of six children. The family moved to Western Australia and settled in Leederville in 1893. Margaret attended the Kindergarten Training College in West Perth, graduating in 1916.  Kindergarten of the Air  In 1942 the kindergartens in Perth and Fremantle were forced to close under threat of Japanese air raids. Members of the Kindergarten Union of Western Australia, led by Catherine King, proposed a daily radio program aimed at kindergarten children to Conrad Charlton, State manager of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The program was accepted and named Kindergarten of the Air on 19 February 1942, and a series of trials were held to find a presenter. Graham was chosen after two other kindergarten teachers had auditioned. Her first program was broadcast live on 23 February 1942, with a pianist and two children in the studio. The program began at 9.30am and ran for 20 minutes. It was unscripted and included participation from the children present in the live audience. Each session could include songs, a story, exercise routines, health instruction and hints for making toys. Piano accompaniment was provided by Jean McKinlay.  Influence  The Western Australian Kindergarten of the Air became the model for the rest of the country, with other states following its format and style for their own programs. In 1943 the ABC centralised the program in Sydney, but the time difference between the states meant that Graham's program retained its individuality and popularity.  Later life and death  The popularity of the program gave Graham the chance to speak in other forums about children's education and behaviour. She spoke on Catherine King's program, the ABC Women's Session, and on the Children's Book Week 'Storytime' program in 1949. In 1956, she was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). Graham continued as the sole voice of the Kindergarten of the Air until her health forced her to retire in 1960. She died in 1966, after suffering a stroke, and was cremated in Mount Lawley, Western Australia.

Larson has written for several animated series, including Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Gravity Falls, Littlest Pet Shop, and most notably My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Depending on which series he is working on, he is credited as either Mitch Larson, M.A. Larson (in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and DC Super Hero Girls), and Mitchell Larson (rarely). Larson had become interested in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic from previously working with Lauren Faust, the series' original showrunner, on Foster's Home; he was surprised by her characterization of the main characters and started writing for the show. Larson became a popular figure within the latter show's adult and teenage fanbase of \\"bronies\\" and has become a frequent guest at various conventions. He also wrote lyrics of a few songs on both Friendship is Magic and Littlest Pet Shop, and acted as story editor during the fifth season of Friendship is Magic. In November 2014, Larson's first novel, Pennyroyal Academy, was published under his M.A. Larson moniker. Currently is the Head Writer of Lauren Faust's ongoing show DC Super Hero Girls. Pennyroyal Academy Larson wrote Pennyroyal Academy which was published in November 2014 by Putnam. Larson was influenced by what he called \\"princess fatigue\\" in the popular culture during his time writing for Cartoon Network shows. Brainstorming from this, he considered a children's work where many different princesses would be together in one place, dealing with having to live together. He originally called it Princess Boot Camp, where the princess characters would undergo rigorous training in a parody of a military-like boot camp approach. As he began developing the book, he had read The Uses of Enchantment by Bruno Bettelheim, which analyzed works like Grimm's Fairy Tales using Freudian psychology and concluded that the darker elements of these stories enable children to help develop their emotions. Inspired by this analysis, Larson revamped his work over a six-year period to target a slightly older audience with scarier elements and with less humor. The resulting book became Pennyroyal Academy, which centers on school for budding princesses and knights that train to fight approaching armies led by evil witches. Larson noted that his experience with the characters of Friendship Is Magic resonated in his approach with Pennyroyal Academy. Pennyroyal Academy was well received by critics; the New York Timess Julie Klam called the work a \\"breathtakingly exciting novel\\", and despite the comparison to Harry Potter, felt the work stood on its own. Prior to publication, the work was picked up by Reese Witherspoon's production company, Pacific Standard, for a film adaption. Witherspoon, in her decision to pick up the work, stated that \\"there is a princess story that reflects the values young women truly want to embody ‚Ä¶ These princesses are strong, independent and fierce, and the knights are their match. In telling their story, Larson has created a magical universe that everyone will love to get lost in.\\" Larson has since written two sequels, The Shadow Cadets of Pennyroyal Academy (2016) and The Warrior Princess of Pennyroyal Academy (2017).

The Vulcan is fitted with a magnesium torque tube which has a carbon fibre propeller shaft, a limited-slip differential and an Xtrac 6-speed sequential transmission. The car has a dry kerb weight of . It uses Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, which are fitted on 19 inch APP-TECH wheels that feature centerlock design. Stopping power is aided courtesy of carbon-ceramic brakes, which measure at the front, at the rear, and are produced by Brembo.Specification, Braking System ‚ÄùDiscover the Vulcan‚Äù, Aston Martin, 2015 Engine power delivery is selectable using a selector knob in the car, with the first option setting the power to , the second option setting the power to , and the third and final option allowing the engine to deliver the full of power output. The Vulcan generates GT3-car levels of downforce via its prominent front splitter, rear diffuser and adjustable rear wing. Aston Martin states that the car will produce at and at its Vmax speed. The car has a race-derived pushrod suspension with anti-dive geometry and is complemented by Multimatic‚Äôs Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars, front and rear driver-adjustable anti-lock braking, and variable traction control. Like the Ferrari FXX, 599XX, FXX-K, and the McLaren P1 GTR, the Vulcan must be approved to drive on track day events by the factory. However, unlike those cars, customers can keep the car on their own.  Vulcan AMR Pro package  The AMR Pro package for the Vulcan was unveiled at the 2017 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The package contains extra aerodynamic pieces to enhance the performance of the car, with the presence of an enhanced dual-element rear wing with a Gurney flap, large dive planes, side wheel arch louvres, and turning vanes designed to improve steering response. These improvements allow the car's downforce performance to increase by 27%. Balance has been improved as well, with a 47/53 weight distribution, due to the majority of the pressure going towards the centre of the car. The car still has the same 7.0-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine as the standard Vulcan, with the power output being unchanged. The 6-speed transmission is also retained unchanged, but shorter final driver ratio is used in order to improve acceleration. All existing cars can be fitted with the AMR Pro package by the Aston Martin's Q division at the owner's request.  Road-legal conversion  An Aston Martin Vulcan was made road-legal by British engineering company RML Group through a series of modifications. This car remains the only Vulcan to be made legal for the road. Several changes had to be performed in order to meet road regulations. The group took 18 months to modify the entire car. The ride height of the car is raised for ground clearance. The rear LED \\"blades\\" are covered with a plastic light housing for radius management. Two front integrated headlights have been added, under the inspiration of the modern Aston Martin design. The styling of the lights mimic the factory lights of the Vulcan. As for the front splitter, the car's fences, placed on the side of the aerodynamic piece for more downforce, have been removed, and the length of the carbon fibre splitter has also been shortened. The 7.0-litre naturally-aspirated V12 is remapped for emissions, and the cooling system is replaced with a different unit for better temperature control although it retains its original power output rating. The car's gear ratios are altered, and the clutch was changed to make the launch easier than the regular Vulcan. Spring rates and damper rates have been changed, and ride height lifting has been added to allow for easier driving on the road. The steering lock became less limited to allow the car to steer more and give a smaller turning radius. The Vulcan's side mirrors have been replaced in favour of the DB11's mirrors, since the regular Vulcan's mirror glass does not meet road regulations, and it does not include mirror-integrated indicators. All windows have been replaced with specific units that meet road regulations, and a windscreen wiper and washer jets have been added. The rear bumper has been modified to allow for a Euro-spec registration plate to be installed, along with plate lights, and a reflector. The rear wing plates' ends contain an amber light strip for direction indicators, and the fuel cap has been modified. As for the interior, the seats (which originally had head support) have been changed to allow for visibility, and the steering wheel has been drastically modified. The doors are central locking, and the car contains an immobiliser key. According to RML, owners of this car can ask the group to revert the car to racing spec whenever the owner desires.

Born in South Australia, he began his career at The Adelaide Advertiser in 1874 as a general reporter. He began reporting on new mines in South Australia, then travelled to others in New South Wales and Western Australia. When the Kalgoorlie mines began to predominate he moved from Coolgardie and bought the weekly newspaper Kalgoorlie Western Argus, later launching the daily Kalgoorlie Miner. In 1900 he married 21-year-old Effie Fenn and they had eight children.  Career  Hocking had a reputation as a good boss in Kalgoorlie, which no doubt contributed to his election as a councillor and later mayor of the Municipality of Kalgoorlie. He was involved in the Kalgoorlie Racing Club and Chamber of Commerce, and president of the Fresh Air League which sent goldfields children to the coast for holidays. The company he formed in 1896, Hocking & Co. Pty. Ltd., still publishes The Miner, as it is locally known, to this day. Along with The West Australian, it is the only other daily print newspaper in Western Australia. Following his death in 1935, the running of the newspaper was taken over by his four sons, which continued until 1970.

In his role as a custodian of legends, Nangan was responsible for the preservation of the sounds and performances of ceremonial dance and songlines. As an artist, he created hundreds of pencil and watercolour drawings, as well as incised pearl shells and boab nuts, that convey powerful connections to his Country.  Country, family and working life  Joe Nangan was possibly born on 25 February 1900 at Kanen (Fishermens Bend) in Western Australia. His Country extended east of Broome: from his Walmatjarri father (later known as Dicky Djulba), he held rights to an area called Paliara, near Christmas Creek station, and from his Nyikina mother (later known as Anne Binmaring), to an area called Jirkalli (or Jirrkaliy) on Dampier Downs station. Nangan initially worked as a Stockman on pastoral stations before learning the trade of station butcher. In 1916, he was droving elsewhere when members of his family were killed in the Mowla Bluff Massacre. Nangan worked as a butcher at the Catholic mission at the Beagle Bay Community between 1920 and 1940 when he became known as Butcher Joe. On 26 January 1937, he married Therese Bende and they had a daughter, Mary. Widowed in 1963, Nangan married Josephine Balgalai on 17 June 1967.  Ceremonial responsibilities  Ethnomusicologist, Alison Moyle, has studied the nulu or nurlu form of the Kimberley people. The nulu is a dancing or corroboree song. It is primarily vocal and is accompanied with boomerang clapsticks. These songs are said to \\"found\\" in dreams and are communicated to those who \\"find\\" them by spirits. Nangan's Nulu ganany (series of songs) includes references to his mother's death and the spirits near her grave. As early as the 1920s, the spirit of Nangan's aunt endowed him with the marinji- rinji nulu and Mayata, the pelican being. She showed him the pelican headdress depicted in Nangan's drawings. He wore the headdress in the Mayata nulu (dance of the pelican), which he performed in the Broome area from the 1920s until 1985. Nangan's custodial responsibilities were broad. In addition to the territories he inherited from his mother and father, Nangan assumed responsibility for ensuring that law was also maintained in neighbouring territories as the populations dwindled through disease and massacre. This is evident in the breath of mythic content in Nangan's legacy. Many of the stories depicted are connected to the Jirkalli area on Dampier Downs station, but many others belong to or affect the Jukun, Yawuru and Karajarri people nearby. Works of art It is estimated that Nangan made several thousand artworks in his life. These include incised pearl shells and boab nuts, as well as hundreds of pencil and watercolour drawings. Nangan's style was figurative, making use of his knowledge of anatomy, tonal modelling, perspective and shadows to depict figures in motion through space. Nangan's use of figuration for traditional subject matter, though, is unusual. Whilst secular themes are frequently realistically rendered, Aboriginal artists often choose to use more traditional styles for such content. Nangan's drawings depict flora, fauna, spirit beings, mythological or historic events, but it is important to note that he rarely drew secular themes, almost exclusively depicting characters and narratives from the Dreaming. Nangan's depictions of traditional law and stories of his people are important records of Aboriginal life and legends. He recorded a vast amount of cultural knowledge, which he considered to be vital to an Aboriginal person's sense of identity, and was acutely aware of its rapid loss and the impact of this on individual wellbeing. He was also concerned that the loss would compromise the continuity of harmony between the natural and supernatural worlds. Nangan was most prolific in the 1970s and 1980s, fulfilling commissions from Western Australian art dealer Mary Macha for three exhibitions held in between 1981 and 1983. His work is included in major Australian collections including the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra), the National Museum of Australia (Canberra), the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Canberra), the Art Gallery of Western Australia (Perth), the Berndt Museum of Anthropology (Perth) and Edith Cowan University (Perth) . = Incised pearl shells = Nangan was familiar with the Riji - the pearl shell and cloth ceremonial insignia traditionally worn by Aboriginal men from his Country. Riji influenced the incised pearl shells he created during the 1950s and 1960s, such as Pearl shell with a variety of Australian flora, fauna and figures including a winged female spirit. = Pencil and watercolour drawings = Nangan's determination to preserve and pass on his knowledge through his drawings resulted in approximately 600 being produced over three decades. The first of these were possibly produced through contact with anthropologist Helmut Petri who obtained some of Nangan's drawings in the mid-1950s and believed they were his first naturalistic works on paper. Nangan mostly used a soft lead pencil to outline and shade the characters and landforms depicted, reserving bright colour and washes to highlight important features such as body decoration, weaponry and vegetation. The characters are human or animal, although both can possess powers of transmutation. Rocks, trees and other natural features are also coloured as they, too, are central to the events depicted. Nangan was known to have produced many iterations of the same drawing. In some margins, he would draw a tiny insect or animal which was a mnemonic device for him to recall the key themes in the work. However, when Nangan's works were prepared for sale, the pages of the sketchbooks were often separated and the margins cut off, severing a vital link between a drawing and any transcribed explanation. Examples of Nangan's pencil and watercolour drawings are: * Nyinerri - The Law Leader (National Gallery of Australia) * Sketchbook of drawings of the Nyikina people (National Museum of Australia) * Parrbul (The sea woman) (The Art Gallery of Western Australia)  Publications  Although unable to read or write English, Nangan's stories are published in two books. Joe Nangan‚Äôs Dreaming (1976) is co-authored by Nangan and Hugh Edwards, as is the story of Bera, the Sun Maidens which was included in a volume of short stories called Daughters of the Sun (1994).  Order of Australia  Nangan was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in June 1987 for service to the arts and to Aboriginal heritage. Death Butcher Joe Nangan died on 21 January 1989 in Broome where he was buried.

History =Ancient history= Map showing the sites and extent of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Harappa was the center of one of the core regions of the Indus Valley Civilization, located in central Punjab. The Harappan architecture and Harrapan Civilization was one of the most developed in the old Bronze Age. Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada.Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency ... ‚Äì Google BooksGazetteer of the Bombay Presidency ..., Volume 1, Part 1-page-11 Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 5000 years old.Punjab History ‚Äì history of Punjab The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilization. The arrival of the Indo-Aryans led to the flourishing of the Vedic civilization along the length of the Indus River. This civilization shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artifacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, Hindu Shahi, Gurjara-Pratihara and old Rajputana.\\"The Gurjara-Pratihara empire, comprising the territories stretching between Bihar, the Panjab and Kathiawar, was the last great pre-Muslim empire of north India.\\" (Ronald Stuart McGregor: A History of Indian Literature.

Punjab was part of the Vedic Civilization Due to its location, the Punjab region came under constant attack and influence from the west and witnessed centuries of foreign invasions by the Greeks, Kushans, Scythians, Turks, Arabs, and Afghans. The city of Taxila, claimed to have been founded by Taksh the son of Bharat who was the brother of Ram. It was reputed to house the oldest university in the world, Takshashila University. One of the teachers was the great Vedic thinker and politician Chanakya. Taxila was a great centre of learning and intellectual discussion during the Maurya Empire. It is a UN World Heritage site, valued for its archaeological and religious history. =Central Asian, Greek, and Persian Empires= Safavid-era painting of Mahmud and Ayaz. The Sultan is to the right, shaking the hand of the shaykh with Ayaz standing behind him. The northwestern part of the South Asia, including Punjab, was repeatedly invaded or conquered by various foreign empires, such as those of Tamerlane, Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan. Having conquered Drangiana, Arachosia, Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days, Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully informed of the magnificence of the country and its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued. Alexander then marched through Ghazni, blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day Mong) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of Multan, who were very skillful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day Sialkot) was razed to the ground. Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and took his army to Persia and Susa. =Arrival of Islam= Bulleh Shah (1680‚Äì1757), a Muslim Sufi poet The Punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths, mainly Hinduism and Buddhism until the Arab Umayyad army brought Islam to the region led by Muhammad bin Qasim who conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab in 712, by defeating Raja Dahir. The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad. It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty, whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams, the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph. Islam was introduced into Northern Punjab during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century and the region subsequently became part of various Turco-Persian and Turco-Mongol Muslim empires. The Ghaznavids had earlier conquered and converted many Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Afghanistan. The province of Punjab was made part of the Ghaznavid Empire with Lahore as its second capital. The region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab region. The famous Sufi mystic Hazrat Ali Hujwiri arrived from Ghazni and settled in Lahore during the reign of Ghaznavids in 11th century. Over the next millennium Islam flourished in Punjab as it became part of different Muslim empires including the Ghurids, Delhi Sultanate and Mughals. In cooperation with local Punjabi tribes and others, a millennium long Islamic dominance was achieved across South Asia and with its peak during the Mughal Empire. Indian historian Rajmohan Gandhi says that conversions to Islam in Punjab were justified by multiple factors, like the missionary activities of the Sufis, the fact that tribes like Jats or Gujjars weren't absorbed into the Hindu caste system or that Dalits tried to precisely escape it.Rajmohan Gandhi, Punjab: A History from Aurangzeb to Mountbatten, Rupa, 2015, chapter 1 =Mughal Empire= The Mughals controlled the region from 1524 until around 1739 and implemented building projects which remain iconic landmarks of the Punjab such as the Shalimar Gardens and the Badshahi Mosque, both situated in Lahore. Muslim soldiers, traders, architects, theologians and Sufis came from the rest of the Muslim world to the empire. The last Muslim ruler to control the Punjab was the Afghan conqueror Ahmad Shah Durrani who made the Punjab a part of his Durrani Empire lasting until 1762. =Independence= In 1947 the Punjab province of British India was divided along religious lines into West Punjab and East Punjab. Western Punjab was assimilated into the new country of Pakistan, while East Punjab became a part of modern-day India. This led to massive rioting as both sides committed atrocities against fleeing refugees. Punjab (Pakistan), which once formed a major region of British Punjab, was home to a large minority population of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.The Punjab in 1920s ‚Äì A Case study of Muslims, Zarina Salamat, Royal Book Company, Karachi, 1997. table 45, pp. 136. Migration between India and Pakistan was continuous before independence. By the 1900s Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim and supported the Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After independence, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while Muslim refugees from India settled in the Western Punjab and across Pakistan.Dube, I. &. S. (2009). From ancient to modern: Religion, power, and community in India hardcover. Oxford University Press. =Recent history= At the Wagah border ceremony Since the 1950s, Punjab industrialized rapidly. New factories were established in Lahore, Multan, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Wah. In the 1960s, the new city of Islamabad was founded north of Rawalpindi. Agriculture continues to be the largest sector of Punjab's economy. The province is the breadbasket of the country as well as home to the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, the Punjabis. Unlike neighbouring India, there was no large-scale redistribution of agricultural land. As a result, most rural areas are dominated by a small set of feudalistic land-owning families. In the 1950s there was tension between the eastern and western halves of Pakistan. In order to address the situation, a new formula resulted in the abolition of the province status for Punjab in 1955. It was merged into a single province West Pakistan. In 1972, after East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh, Punjab again became a province. Punjab witnessed major battles between the armies of India and Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971. Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as Kahuta. It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation. Trade and people-to-people contacts through the Wagah border are now starting to become common. Indian Sikh pilgrims visit holy sites such as Nankana Sahib. Starting in the 1980s, large numbers of Punjabis migrated to the Middle East, Britain, Spain, Canada and the United States for economic opportunities, forming the large Punjabi diaspora. Business and cultural ties between the United States and Punjab are growing. Also, there are many Punjabi Muslims in India living a quiet and happy life in a minority population, most of them are in the city of Malerkotla.

His prints covered a wide variety of genres; amongst his best known are his Yokohama-e pictures of foreigners in Yokohama in the 1860s, a period when he was a best-selling artist. He was a member of the Tokugawa shogunate's delegation to the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris. Life and career Sadahide was born Hashimoto Kenjir≈ç () in 1807 in Fusa Province (modern Chiba Prefecture) in Shim≈çsa. He joined Utagawa school master Kunisada's studio in the 1820s and become one of the master's most prominent students. As a member of the school, he took on Utagawa as a surname, and also used the surname Gountei as an art name, and also used his birth surname as an art name late in his career. Sadahide's earliest known works are the illustrations for a book ' (', 1824), the first of many books he was to illustrate throughout his career. Most of his early works were bijin-ga portraits of beauties. In the 1830s and 1840s he broadened his output to landscapes and musha-e warrior prints. In the 1850s Sadahide began to become known for his prints of exotic locales. In he produced the five-volume Kaigai Shinwa (, New Overseas Stories) about the First Opium War in China, and in 1855 he produced the four-volume ' (, Northern Japan Illustrated), which depicted the Ainu people in Ezo, the name at the time for the northernmost parts of Japan. This interest expanded to maps: he produces prints of maps of Edo, Yokohama, Japan, and the world‚Äîthis last quite accurate and likely modeled after a Dutch example. His largest map was a nine-sheet panorama of Yokohama with a breadth of two metres. In the 1859 to 1862 Sadahide produced a large number of Yokohama-e prints of foreigners and the goods they brought to Japan after the country ended its self-imposed isolation in 1854. Among these prints was the series ', (', Foreigners Viewing Famous Places in Edo). While there is scant evidence of the reception of these works, the number of extant copies suggests they were popular, and they appear to depict foreigners in a positive light. Several prints depict pleasant interactions between foreigner and Japanese figures, such as dining together or playing badminton. This in contrast to the philosophy of ' (\\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\\") that had gained currency since the Convention of Kanagawa of 1854. Sadahide also produced guidebooks to Yokohama, include one of five volumes in 1862‚Äì66 called ' (, Things seen and heard at the Yokohama open port). He details the eating habits and technology of Yokohama's foreign residents, and suggests the Japanese would do well to learn from the West with such statements as: \\"We are by nature emotional and want a quick profit, but nowadays the Japanese merchants in Yokohama are trying hard to follow the Western model of remaining calm.\\" While these works emphasize contrasts between the Japanese and foreigners, they also dispel myths: Sadahide notes that not all foreigners are tall or have long noses, despite the stereotypes. Yokohama yokuran no shinkei (Panoramic view of Yokohama)1871 The artist continued to make prints after moving to Nagasaki. There Sadahide made a panorama that was long and produced books on the history and geography of Western lands. He joined ten other artists as part of a delegation the Tokugawa shogunate sent to the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris, where ten of his Edo views were exhibited. The following year, it was reported he ranked the best-selling ukiyo-e artist. Sadahide died in 1878 or 1879, shortly after producing a print of Yokohama the size of a tatami mat in 1871 entitled \\"Yokohama yokuran no shinkei\\". The first exhibition dedicated to Sadahide's work was held in 1997, subtitled The ukiyo-e artist who flies in the sky ( ').

Work At its root, Mann‚Äôs multidisciplinary artwork explores the possibility for one to rebel in contemporary society. Mann often utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to making art which has included performance, photography, event coordination, drawing, video, rioting, publishing, and sculpture. Many of her installations encourage public engagement and participatory performance among her audiences. To make the video \\"Can't Afford the Freeway\\" (2007-2010), Mann recorded interviews with Captain Dylan Alexander Mack, an Iraq war veteran. These interviews would become the audio for a video where Mann recorded herself in several acrobatic and at times combative movements with her car.http://dailyserving.com/2010/05/cant-afford-the-freeway/ In 2011, \\"Ass on the Street\\", a video in which the artist feels her way along a South Central fence in a black dress and donkey head she can't see out of was played on LA Metro Busses as part of Out the Window, a project initiative by the LA art production organization Freewaves. in 2013 the artist created 3 large sculptures for an exhibition at Side Street Projects in Pasadena. Mann was inspired by listening technology used between World War I and World War II. Listening as a political act has been a consistent theme in Mann's work, and the following year she staged several conversations with civic and federal workers at Grand Park Los Angeles as part of a series of programing curated by Machine Project.

In mathematics Alexander's theorem states that every knot or link can be represented as a closed braid; that is, a braid in which the corresponding ends of the strings are connected in pairs. The theorem is named after James Waddell Alexander II, who published a proof in 1923. Braids were first considered as a tool of knot theory by Alexander. His theorem gives a positive answer to the question Is it always possible to transform a given knot into a closed braid? A good construction example is found in Colin Adams's book. However, the correspondence between knots and braids is clearly not one-to-one: a knot may have many braid representations. For example, conjugate braids yield equivalent knots. This leads to a second fundamental question: Which closed braids represent the same knot type? This question is addressed in Markov's theorem, which gives ‚Äòmoves‚Äô relating any two closed braids that represent the same knot.

It resulted in a US/ARVN victory. Background C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc District in Long An Province was a VC stronghold in the Mekong Delta. The operation plan called for the deployment of five Companies of the 3rd and 4th Battalions, 47th Infantry Regiment into the operations area by assault craft and sweep south towards the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry blocking positions near the town of Ap Bac in Tien Giang Province. Company C, 3/47th Infantry would act as reserve. Operation On the morning of 19 June 3 Companies of the 4/47th Infantry were landed 4 km southeast of C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc, 2 Companies of the 3/47th Infantry were landed 1.6 km south of C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc while the ARVN 2/46th Infantry was landed near Ap Bac. At 10:00 U.S. intelligence learned that a battalion size VC force was located east of the ARVN blocking position. Company C, 3/47th Infantry was deployed by helicopters south of the reported VC location while Company C, 4/47th Infantry was moved by patrol craft northeast of the location. By 11:50 Company C 3/47th Infantry had swept the area but failed to locate any VC, however Company C, 4/47th Infantry encountered VC positions as they moved west. At the same time Company A, 4/47th Infantry moving south towards Company C, 4/47th Infantry walked into an L-shaped ambush from well-entrenched VC; exposed on open rice paddies the Company sustained heavy casualties. Artillery and air support could not be used initially due to confusion over the location of the 4/47th Platoons, but from 12:00 helicopter gunship and artillery fire began to supplement the fire from small arms and nearby patrol craft. Company B, 4/47th Infantry was moved behind Company A while Company C, 3/47th Infantry was deployed north and then began to assault towards the east joining up with Companies A and B approaching from the northwest. Companies B and C continued attacking east, while Company A moved into a blocking position to the north. By 20:00 darkness and enemy fire stopped the assault with Companies B and C, 3/47th Infantry, still some 600 meters west of the ambush site. With nightfall the casualties of Company A, 4/47th Infantry were able to be evacuated, while most of the VC were able to escape through gaps in the U.S. positions. On 20 June 4/47th Infantry searched south of the ambush area locating a VC force north of the Rach Gion Ong stream at Ap Nam and assisted by a Company from the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry, wiped out a VC Platoon. Aftermath The operation concluded on 21 June, U.S. casualties were 46 killed and 15 sailors wounded, while claiming VC losses of 255 killed. Due to its location east of a town called Ap Bac, the 19 June ambush is sometimes referred to as Second Ap Bac after the disastrous Battle of Ap Bac on 2 January 1963, however that battle took place approximately 40 km further west.

It is dedicated to Chitravelayudhar (CittiravƒìlƒÅyutar, literally \\"One with elegant spear\\") who was once the guardian deity of Mattakkalappu Desam (Batti - Ampara districts nowadays) and this temple enjoyed the honor of Desathukkovil (Tƒìcattukk≈çvil, royal temple) of the Batticaloa region. Archaeological and historical evidences suggest that Cholan, Kotte and Kandyan kings maintained strong relations with this temple in the past. Etymology Kovil is the Tamil equivalent of shrine or temple. All Hindu temples in Tamil Speaking region are generally known as Thirukkovils adding the prefix 'Thiru' which means great or sacred. The inhabitants of Eastern Sri Lanka praise that it is unusual to apply the sacred term \\"Thirukkovil\\" to not only a specific temple but to its whereabout too. \\"Mattakkalappu Purva charithiram\\", the 18th century CE Tamil chronicle of Eastern Sri Lanka, narrates that Nagarmunai Subramanya Kovil was the first temple initially constructed in agamic tradition at Batticaloa region and it was subsequently known as \\"Thirukkovil\\" (prominent temple). The old name Nagarmunai is interpreted as it was one of the ancient settlements of Naga tribe of ancient Sri Lanka. Another name indicating Thirukkovil, Ka·πá·π≠apƒÅ·πáantu·πüai, is also mentioned in Purva Charithiram manuscript. Legends Kalinga King Bhuvaneka Gajabahu and his wife Cholan princess Thambathi Nallaal visited Batticaloa region during their way to Katirkamam. Prasannajith, the kinglet of Batticaloa welcomed the royal couple and requested them to repair the chief temple of his country, Nagarmunai Subrahmanya Swami Kovil. Bhuvaneka Gajabahu sought the assistance of his father in law Thirucholan and constructed Nagarmunai Kovil with the chola immigrants sent by the same. He consecrated the temple and renamed Thiukkovil' since it was the first temple erected in agamic tradition in Batticaloa region. Prasannajith gifted his southern territory to Bhuvaneka Gajabahu as a reward for this marvelous construction. Gajabahu and his queen Thambathi Nallaal established a new kingdom known as 'Unnaasagiri' there. After a few years, their son Megavarnan, whose royal title was Manuneya Gajabahu reconstructed the temple in stone. There were many ladies and Devadasis providing their services in Thirukkovil. Thangammai was one among them and she was the aalaathipendu (lady doing aarti) of Thirukkovil. During her later life, She couldn't be at the temple on time for the service and temple administrators terminated her service as she was 80 years old then. She couldn't bear that pain of leaving lord Citravelyudhan and cried and yelled all the night in the temple. Next day morning no one could find Thangammai in the temple premises but miraculously there was an eight year old girl getting ready for aarti. Devotees and administrators surprised when she revealed herself she was none other than Thangammai. History Though the origin of the Thirukkovil temple is uncertain, it is assumed that the temple was initially a small thatched hut worshipped by Vedda and Naga tribes of this region. It was later expanded and built according to agamic tradition during the Chola rule in Sri Lanka (993-1070 CE). The deity here was venerated as the guardian deity of the Batticaloa region, ruled by Vannimai chieftains, feudatory under the Kandyan Kings. The stone inscriptions such as Thambiluvil Inscription confirm that once this deity was revered by the kings such as Vijayabahu VII of Kotte and Rajasinha II of Kandy. This temple has been substantially mentioned as Thirukkovil Pagoda in the Dutch maps of Ceylon starting from 16th century CE . The temple was looted and destructed by Portuguese in 1620s and it could only resurrect after two centuries. However, the rituals and its state importance through Batticaloa region were continued in its grievous period also. Thomas Christie, an Inspector of Hospitals of British Ceylon describes the antiquity of Sanctum, the sculptures and chariot belonged to Thirukkovil during his journey to Tangalle from Trincomalee in 1802. Thesaththukkovil Inscriptions and Sandstone pillars preserved at Thirukkovil temple. Thirukkovil is usually referred as thesaththukkovil as well as thiruppadaikkovil. Thiruppadai Kovil (‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æü‡Øà‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç Tiruppa·π≠aik k≈çvil Literally \\"Holy Temple of Soldiers' Camp or weapons\\") is the term referred to seven popular temples in Batticaloa region - Kokkadichcholai, Sithandy, Thirukkovil, Mandur, Kovil Porativu, Verugal and Ukanthai. They are believed to be revered by the Chieftains ruled the country. Some historians consider the term \\"pa·π≠ai\\" in Thiruppataik kovil refers to weapon of Murugan - Vel, and ignores Kokkadichcholai from Thiruppataik Kovil list as it is a Sivan temple. Old Batticaloa District was divided into 8 \\"pattu\\"s (Administrative divisions) - Akkaraipattu, Karaivakupattu, Eruvilpattu, Manmunaippattu, Sammanthuraipattu, Porativupattu, Eravurpattu, Kiriwittipattu along with three other adjacent pattus - Koralaipattu, Panamaipattu and Nadukadupattu.Jacob Burnand (1794) \\"Memorial Compiled By Late Chief Jacob Burnand for his scuccessor Johannas Philippus Wambeek\\" p.284 Ritual rights in Thirukkovil Annual Festivals were shared with whole inhabitants of 7 main pattus and Panamaipattu of Batticaloa region. According to Temple records, it can be confirmed that this custom was continued till 1950s. The structure of Sanctum is identified with Pandyan architecture. Inscriptions and Segments of broken sandstone pillars can be observed in the courtyard around the temple. Two main inscriptions are preserved in a small room south to temple entrance. One of them - Thambiluvil Inscription found in Thambiluvil Sri Kannaki amman temple tells about the donation of \\"Vovil\\" (probably an irrigation water source) by King Vijayabahu VII of Kotte kingdom (1507-1521) while the purpose of another inscription is unclear which is also donated by same King. Annual Festival Sanctum of Thirukkovil Temple believed to manifest Pandyan Architecture. Annual Festival of Thirukkovil is called as \\"Aadi Amavasai theertham\\" (\\"‡ÆÜ‡Æü‡Æø ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æö‡Øà‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Øç\\"\\"ƒÄ·π≠i amƒÅvƒÅcait tƒ´rttam\\" simply \\"tƒ´rttam\\") which is a mega festival of South-East Sri Lanka. It is celebrated for 18 days and finished on Aadi Amavasya, the new moon day comes on Aadi month (July‚ÄìAugust) of Tamil Hindu Calendar. Necrolatry carried out in the shore of Thirukkovil sea on an Adi Amavasai is considered to give peace to the spirits of ancestors. A Dutch merchant Johann Herman Von Bree states about the Annual Festival of Thirukkovil where the assembly of \\"Dessave\\" (Chieftain) and the thousand of people of Batticaloa happened in July month of 1603 CE.Donald Ferguson,(1998) \\"The Earliest Dutch Visits to Ceylon\\", pp.112,113 Deterioration of Administration Even after the colonial period, Temple was administrated by a conservative method based on clan system - ‡Æ™‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æø (\\"Pa·πá·π≠u parava·πái\\"). The ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øç (Va·πá·πáakkar, the Batticaloan equivalent post for head of trustee), belongs to Vellalar caste of Thambiluvil village played a main role in the administration while \\"‡Æµ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç\\" (Va·πâ·πâiya·πâƒÅr - former kinglet of Batticaloa region) of Karavakupattu, belongs to Pa·πáikka·πâƒÅ matriclan of Mukkuvar caste supervised the rituals and other main activities of temple. Va·πá·πáakkar is expected to be from Kantan kuty, one of the prominent matriclans of Thambiluvil village. Karavaku Vanniyanar is identified in the name of \\"Kovil Vanniyanar\\" during his temple activities. A post named \\"‡Æµ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ§‡Æø\\" ( Va·π≠·π≠ƒÅrap piratiniti, Regional representatives) was given to each villages and \\"Pattus\\" of Batticaloa, from Panama to Kallady. Nur Yalman, a Turkish anthropologist observed \\"Kudukkai Kuruthal\\", a ritual based on Caste and Clan system, which was observed in another Thiruppadaikkovil Kokkadichcholai.Nur Yalman (1967) \\"Under the Bo Tree\\", pp.326,327 After the independence of the country, the reliability of Pa·πá·π≠u parava·πái was questioned in the mid 20th Century and had to face many court cases. Since the old settlement around the temple was started to be distinguished as two villages separately - Thirukkovil and Thambiluvil, where the latter had the post of Vannakkar, the inhabitants of Thirukkovil raised their voice for the right to rule their own temple.Dennis B.McGilvray, (2008) Crucible of Conflict And the old Mattakkalappu Desam divided de facto two new districts in 1961 - one remained in the same name while latter got the name \\"Amparai\\". As the capital of newly formed Batticaloa District, Mamangam, another ancient temple situated near Puliyantivu, which also celebrated its annual festival on Adi Amavasai, subsequently began to replace Thirukkovil in northern Batticaloa. As the results of these facts, Va·π≠·π≠ƒÅrap piratinitis north to Kalmunai ignore their responsibilities on temple. At last, Thirukkovil lost its primitive state significance permanently. However,the Vannakkar-based Pa·πá·π≠u parava·πái system still continues compromised along with the modern administration system of President, Secretary and Treasurer in which Kovil Vanniyanar post was integrated into President post. Hence, Thirukkovil Temple could maintain its position as \\"Tecathuk Kovil\\" with the homage of the Tamil inhabitants of Southern Batticaloa - known as Ampara District today. They still praise the guardian deity at Thirukkovil and celebrate his Mega fiesta \\"tƒ´rttam\\" Festival annually with full of devotion and harmony.

Aristolochia macrophylla belongs to the plant family Aristolochiaceae and is found primarily along the Cumberland Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains in the eastern portion of the United States, as well as Ontario, Canada. This species of plant has received considerable attention in the past few decades for the discovery of a potent compound called aristolochic acid, which has been the focus of debate due its harmful side effects. Aside from its decorative qualities, owing to its large leaves and dense growth, it is cultivated in gardens because it is a larval host for the pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor. Description Flower of Aristolochia macrophylla This vine is a flowering plant that can grow up to at a relatively fast rate. In the early stages of its development, the vines of Aristolochia macrophylla are very stiff and rigid, but as the plant develops, the vines become much more flexible and stable. This is because the plant is composed of sclerenchymatous cortical tissue, which has an outer cylinder, or layer, as well as an inner cylinder. Years of research showed that it is the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder that gives the stems of this plant its mechanical stability. This species flowers between the months of June and August in the U.S. with its seeds ripening in September and October. The large heart-shaped leaves can range between . These dark green leaves can overlap and cover an arbor or trellis. Plants can also be used to provide extensive covers for pillars, sun porches, fences, walls as well as other things. =Flowers and fruit= Aristolochia macrophylla - MHNT The reason why Aristolochia macrophylla is often referred to as \\"Dutchman‚Äôs pipe\\" is because of the yellowish-green flowers they produce. Each flower also sprouts from the calyx mouth to further produce 3 brownish-purple lobes. It is this complex of the flowers and lobes that gives the species a close resemblance to Dutch smoking pipes. The flowers may be hidden by the thick vegetation of the pipevine. The flowers start to open up in May and June in the U.S. and the fragrant flowers attract small flies and gnats. Once an insect has arrived to the flower, the insect is trapped inside a tube, which forces the insect to carry out pollination. Once pollination has been completed and time has passed since pollination, a fruit resembling a cucumber, between 6‚Äì10 cm in height, and 3 cm in diameter is produced. The fruit then ripens, usually around September in the U.S., turns brown and splits into six fragments to disperse its small, triangular seeds. Distribution Aristolochia macrophylla has a relatively wide distribution. It is found from Maine to Alabama, and reaches all the way to Georgia, Tennessee and Kansas. The plant species generally ranges from the Eastern region of the United States up to Michigan, with the exception of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and reaches the southeast up until Florida where the presence of this species comes to an abrupt halt. It is also common in Mississippi and Alabama all the way up north to Maine and Ontario, Canada. Aristolochia macrophylla is considered to be a threatened species in Maryland. Although the species is not endangered yet, the pipevine could be well on its way to endangerment if measures are not taken to protect this species from the negative consequences of deforestation and other aspects of human disturbance. Habitat and ecology Blue Ridge Mountains Aristolochia macrophylla is native to the southeast of the United States, however it is also found in the northeast, as well as Ontario, Canada. This plant species resides largely in the Cumberland and Blue Ridge Mountains of southeastern United States. They are native to wooded slopes, gaps, as well as ravines which are mainly in the Cumberland and Blue Ridge Mountains from West Virginia, to Kentucky, Tennessee and northern Georgia. Pipevine eventually spread to other parts of the eastern coast of the United States. Aristolochia macrophylla is naturally found in light sandy soil, medium loamy soil and heavy clay soils, with a preference for drained soils. This species is also primarily found in alkaline soils with high pH. Essentially, Aristolochia macrophylla has a strong preference for moist soils, while being very intolerant to dry soils. Toxicity Aristolochia macrophylla contains the natural substance aristolochic acid, which is found in all plants of the family Aristolochiaceae. Aristolochic acid is a very dangerous compound in that this acid is a potent mutagen and carcinogen that can cause urological cancers as well as permanent kidney failure. Consumption of aristolochic acid can also induce uterine bleeding. Because of this, the FDA has warned consumers to avoid products that contain, or possibly contain, aristolochic acid. Even though aristolochic acid has been found to expedite and arouse the activity of white blood cells, speed the healing of wounds, and possibly be used in concurrence with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, this compound is highly carcinogenic and is very deleterious to renal health. A concoction produced from the root of the plant has been used to treat swelling of the extremities. However, because of the harmful effects associated with the consumption of plants from the family Aristolochiaceae, the roots of pipevine are no longer exploited for their medical benefits.\\"Herb Danger - Aristolochic Acid Warning.‚Äù MedicineNet. Web. 2014-05-05. Even though the plant has been known to have some anticancer and antiseptic properties, the aristolochic acid contained within the plant still remains controversial. Therefore, doctors and scientists have urged the public to not consume any products that contain this potent mutagen, as scientists have seen a surge in the rate of cancer, particularly in the urinary tract, as well as kidney failure, in individuals who have consumed this species, or plants from the same family. Individuals have also consumed concoctions from roots of the plants, as well as the roots themselves, to treat swelling of the lower extremities in the past. However these concoctions are not produced or consumed anymore due to the dangerous health effects associated with consuming these plants.

Rev. 311 (2014) http://harvardlawreview.org/2014/11/daimler-ag-v-bauman/ Background In 2001 Argentina was in a severe economic depression. NML Capital, a 'vulture fund' that specializes in distressed sovereign debt, purchased Argentine public bonds at extreme discounts off a panicking market.NML Capital, Ltd. v. Banco Central de la Republica Arg., 652 F.3d 172 (2d Cir. 2011) (vacating attachment of central bank reserves). Argentina then defaulted on $103 billion of debt.EM Ltd. v. Republic of Arg., 473 F.3d 463 (2d Cir. 2007) (affirming vacatur). After announcing that it would not pay its debts Argentina offered its creditors a choice: accept new bonds worth 70% less, or receive nothing. The vast majority of bondholders accepted the new bonds. NML Capital did not. Instead, NML Capital brought a collection action against Argentina in Manhattan federal district court. Finding that Argentina did have to pay its debt, District Judge Thomas Griesa ordered Argentina to pay plaintiff $2.4 billion and, pari passu, to stop favoring other creditors over NML Capital.NML Capital, 652 F.3d at 177 fn.6. Argentina responded by pulling its assets out of the United States. Seeking to satisfy the judgment order, NML Capital undertook a worldwide search for Argentina's assets, at one point convincing Ghana to seize the Argentine Navy's and forcing Argentina's president to charter private airplanes to avoid having her state aircraft confiscated. As part of its search for attachable assets NML Capital served subpoenas on Bank of America and Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina. Argentina moved to quash, claiming that as a sovereign the locations of its assets were immune from discovery. Judge Griesa disagreed, ordering discovery on all assets \\"reasonably calculated to lead to attachable property.\\" On Argentina's appeal the Second Circuit affirmed the discovery order. Still refusing to comply, Argentina then petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States, and the petition was granted. Arguments were held on April 21, 2014, with Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler appearing as an friend supporting Argentina and Theodore Olson appearing for the hedge funds. Opinion The Supreme Court affirmed, with Justice Scalia writing for the seven member majority. Scalia first traces the history of foreign sovereign immunity in the United States, from initially undisturbed Executive discretion, to the \\"muddling\\" noncommercial acts distinction the State Department adopted in 1952, to Congress's creation of the \\"comprehensive \\" Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. Scalia then turns to the statute's text finding the FSIA does not expressly address post judgment discovery. Argentina claimed that there is \\"meaning from this silence \\", and since discovery is not expressly permitted it is, then, prohibited. Scalia disagrees. Emphasizing that FSIA is the comprehensive framework for sovereign immunity, Scalia finds that any claimed immunity must stand or fall on the Act's text alone.Cf. Scalia's opinion for the Court in , where Argentina was denied immunity for an earlier default because \\"[f]ortunately... the FSIA was not written on a clean slate\\". Noting that the \\"riddle \\" of Congress's motive was not \\"ours to solve \\", Scalia found that since Congress did not mention foreign sovereign immunity from post judgment discovery in the Act, there can be no such immunity. Dissent Justice Ginsburg dissented. Noting that FISA and international law only allow the attachment of commercial property, Ginsburg objected to the discovery order's \\"unlimited inquiry \\". Because NML Capital had offered no proof that foreign noncommercial assets were subject to attachment, Ginsburg questioned what authorization a US court could have to act as a \\"clearinghouse for information \\" about Argentina's noncommercial property. Reaction One month later Argentina, again, defaulted on its debt. Argentina then unsuccessfully attempted to sue the United States at the Hague for \\"judicial malevolence\\". The United Nations General Assembly condemned debt collection on sovereign debt. After Argentina continued to refuse to follow court orders, Judge Griesa held it in contempt. Creditors worldwide are imitating NML Capital, with Argentina losing lawsuits to creditors in Germany and England.BGH, XI ZR 47/14 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-24/argentina-likely-to-lose- german-appeals-case-over-bond-payments On November 22, 2015 Argentina elected Mauricio Macri as its new president.

A number of plant species are found, the major ones being Cyperus papyrus (Matende/Matete) and Typha domingensis (Mabilimbili). The livelihood of the communities living around the wetland depends on various services provided by the wetland. The main social economic activities of the communities around the Mara Wetland are fishing and papyrus harvesting. https://www.academia.edu/5451536/Spatial_Variation_of_Denitrification_in_Mara_Wetland_Tanzania A fisherman holding Kambale/Mumi fish (Clarias sp.) which was taken from the Mara Wetland. Fishing at the Mara Wetland is normally for household food and sale Over 80% of the population in communities adjacent to the wetland make their daily living from fishing activities. Although papyrus harvesting is among the major social economic activities of the community around the Mara Wetland only 5% of the papyrus is harvested per year. Papyrus is normally used in making of different household commodities such as mats, baskets, placards, ceiling board, vegetable containers, lamp shades, pads and arm chairs. The threats Mara wetland is continuously degraded despite many efforts that have been done to rescue its biodiversity. Land use change over the past years was the major problem in the Mara river basin.

These dynamics are associated with changes in land use in the catchments area: decreasing vegetation covers are causing a faster run-off of rainwater.MARA DRYLAND BECOMES WETLAND A social ecological and multi scale perspective on the adaptability of the livelihood system around the Tanzania Mara wetlands\\",Ewald Bogers,2007 http://www.ethesis.net/dryland/MARAWETLAND.pdfhttp://idl.iscram.org/files/mutie/2005/802_Mutie_etal2005.pdf Near the river mouth in Tanzania, the rapidly fluctuating water levels in Lake Victoria of the previous century have further added to discharge difficulties of the Mara River. Consequently, floods have become more common and large parts of the Tanzanian Mara wetlands have become more permanent instead of temporary wetlands. These dynamics have caused a subsequent land cover change from dryland (that accasionally flooded) to wetland forests, to a wetland vegetation with varied water related plants as mentioned above where eventually the Cyperus papyrus has becomes one of the most dominant species. These rapid changes have had major effects on the ecology and the livelihoods depending on it. Every stage has different effects on each livelihood activity but generally stated cattle farmers have seen their pastures decreased rapidly, fishermen have first seen open water bodies increased but later decreased again, and new livelihood activities as making mats from the paparyusses have taken a major flight.MARA DRYLAND BECOMES WETLAND A social ecological and multi scale perspective on the adaptability of the livelihood system around the Tanzania Mara wetlands\\",Ewald Bogers,2007 http://www.ethesis.net/dryland/MARAWETLAND.pdf References Category:Geography of Mara Region Category:Nile Category:Lake Victoria ","title":"Mara Wetland"},{"id":"45513332","text":"Barclay George \\"Buddy\\" Reid (born 4 November 1940) is a former cricketer who played first-class cricket for Ceylon in the 1960s.

Life Bugg's father was a wool-comber at Mildenhall, Suffolk, who died when his son was about fifteen, leaving him the business and some property. While still a young man he joined the Society of Friends. About 1675 Bugg was persuaded to go to a meeting which was interrupted by soldiers, and, with other Quakers, was arrested and fined; in default of payment his goods were distrained. Rumours circulated among the Suffolk Friends that Bugg had given information of the meeting and had received money for his treason. He held the preacher, Samuel Cater, who had urged him to attend the meeting, liable for the fine; Cater referred the matter to twelve arbitrators, who found that he was not liable. In 1677 Bugg attended the yearly Quaker meeting in London, and complained to William Penn that the Friends in the country refused him justice. Dissatisfied with the result of a second arbitration during 1679‚Äì80, Bugg continued to agitate for the repayment of his fines, and a Quaker named George Smith attempted to settle the matter by offering to pay half: Bugg took money, and refused to return it as agreed, leading to a quarrel. The result was that he left the Quakers in 1680, and began to write against them. Anne Docwra, a Quaker minister and Bugg's aunt, entered into controversy with him. For some years he continued to write against Quakers, on his own account receiving money from the Church of England. Docwra attacked his character, and Bugg had friends attest a certificate to it. Bugg was further attacked from the Quaker side by Thomas Ellwood, Thomas Lower, and Richard Richardson. In 1713 he was imprisoned, for unknown cause, at Ely, and then for the rest of his life appears to have resided at Mildenhall.

He made significant contributions to the design and retrofit of concrete structures, and developed the first displacement- based method of seismic design. Early life and education Born in Wellington in 1943, Priestley was educated at Wellington Technical College from 1956 to 1959. When aged 16 he began studying civil engineering at the University of Canterbury, completing a Bachelor of Engineering with first- class honours and, in 1966, a PhD. His thesis was titled Moment redistribution in prestressed concrete continuous beams. Professional and academic career From 1967 to 1975 Priestley was the head of the structures laboratory at the Ministry of Works and Development central laboratories in Lower Hutt, where he led structural studies of bridges and buildings. In 1976 he returned to the University of Canterbury where he was a senior lecturer and then reader in the Department of Civil Engineering. Over the next 10 years he conducted research into the seismic behaviour of masonry structures in collaboration with Tom Paulay, and reinforced concrete columns in collaboration with Bob Park. He was also the consulting proof engineer for many major rail bridges and industrial buildings in New Zealand. He served as president of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering from 1985 to 1986. Priestley was then professor of structural engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) from 1987 until 2000. During this time his research focused on the seismic design of concrete bridges. In the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake he was a member of various California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) committees and commissions reviewing the design of damaged bridges, and was also a member or chair of a number of Caltrans committees investigating the seismic strengthening of existing structures. He became professor emeritus of structural engineering at UCSD in 2001. He co- founded the European School for Advanced Studies in Reduction of Seismic Risk (ROSE School) in Pavia, Italy, with Gian Michele Calvi, and served as its co- director from 2002 to 2008, and emeritus co-director from 2009. Following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Priestley was an expert witness before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes, and chaired a panel that investigated the collapse of the CTV Building and PGC Building, and damage to the Hotel Grand Chancellor and Forsyth Barr Building. Priestley died in Christchurch of cancer on 23 December 2014. Legacy Priestley was author or co-author of over 450 scientific papers and 250 research reports, and was the primary advisor for more than 25 doctoral students. His three books are regarded as canonical texts in their particular areas: His research at UCSD with Frieder Seible following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake into structural deficiencies in reinforced concrete columns supported bridges in California led to the development of an economical retrofit solution involving the installation of a metal jacket to reduce the risk of column failure in seismic events. The method has been widely adopted, particularly on the west coast of the United States. A team led by Priestley developed PRESSS (precast seismic structural system), a design methodology for earthquake-resistant buildings in which the building is designed as a collection of rocking blocks able to move independently of each other during a seismic event but are pulled back into their original position by unbonded post-tensioning cables within the precast concrete structure. Priestley eschewed force-based design methods for earthquake-resistant buildings and developed the first method for displacement-based design, an approach that has been described as revolutionary. Traditional force-based methods could not adequately describe the expected damage, or performance, of a building subjected to seismic forces, whereas Priestley's displacement-based approach allows engineers to dictate the behaviour of a building in an earthquake. Honours and awards Priestley was conferred honorary doctorates by ETH Zurich and the National University of Cuyo, Argentina. He was a Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ), the American Concrete Institute (ACI), and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering. In 1999 he was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He won over 30 national and international awards for his research and technical papers, including the Fulton Gold Medal from IPENZ in 1973, the Raymond C. Reese Award from the ACI in 1984 and 1989, and the Freyssinet Medal from the fib in 2010. In the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours, Priestley was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to structural engineering.

Supernaut Twinn's family emigrated to Australia in 1969, where (while attending Rossmoyne Senior High School, Perth) he formed the glam/punk band Supernaut, with fellow Brit- immigrant students Chris and Joe Burnham. Influenced by T. Rex, David Bowie, The New York Dolls and Iggy Pop, they quickly gained popularity and notoriety for their wild stage antics, clothes and controversial lyrics. When asked his impressions of Australia during a Wings tour Paul McCartney mentioned Supernaut and the media immediately took note.Michael Smith (August 14, 2007), The Power of Countdown, Drum Media Magazine, p. 38 The group's first single \\"I Like It Both Ways\\" was banned by radio and soared to the no. 1 chart position, thanks to TV performances on Countdown and Bandstand, forcing radio to reverse its position. Other hits followed, a gold album and a second, critically acclaimed but commercially poor, LP that more closely resembled the band's original style. Twenty Flight Rockers In 1980 Twinn had already decided to relocate back to London, where he formed Twenty Flight Rockers with ex- Generation X drummer Mark Laff, joined by guitarist Ian McKeanThe International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002, page 325The Great Scots Musicography: The Complete Guide to Scotland's Music Makers, page 227 and Jeff Vine on bass. Drawing influences from Eddie Cochran, Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent and Johnny Kidd, the new band adopted a black biker leather clad look and a focus on pure roll 'n' roll blended with a punk rock attitude. The group toured clubs in London, and were subsequently invited to play the BBC's Janice Long show. In 1985, Twenty Flight Rockers released the single \\"Tower Block Rock\\" (ranked #31 for Best Single on Rockerilla Magazine) with ABC Records, and in 1986 the single \\"Johnny 7\\" with WEA Records. Subsequently, Bernie Rhodes (the former manager of The Clash) was hired to manage them. He decided for the band to sign with Epic Records, and he had McKean replaced by The Rockats guitarist Danny B. Harvey. Twenty Flight Rockers recorded a series of sessions (compiled by Twinn and Harvey) as well as an entire studio album entitled Ride.Schwann CD., Volume 4, page 25Schwann Spectrum, Volume 1, Issues 2‚Äì3, page 148Spectrum, Volume 3, Issue 1, page 191 \\"Black Leather Jacket\\" was released as a single promo, with the album due to follow in mid 1988. However, Epic was bought out by Sony, who then dropped the band from the label. Disappointed by political mismanagement from record companies, Twenty Flight Rockers broke up. After the demise of Twenty Flight Rockers, Bernard Rhodes suggested that Gary record with ex-Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock and guitarist Steve New under the moniker Rhode-Twinn. In 1990, a single, \\"Bike Boy\\", was released on Rhodes' own Sacred record label. Twinn and Matlock stayed in touch and began writing and recording with The Damned drummer Rat Scabies and Generation X guitarist Bob \\"Derwood\\" Andrews in 1996. Andrews named the band Dead Horse and a US tour was arranged. However, almost immediately Glen rejoined the Sex Pistols, and the group was disbanded. The Honeydippers Twinn reunited with guitarist Danny B. Harvey, forming a rockabilly duo named The Honeydippers (with Clem Burke joining on drums and John Carlucci on stand up bass).Blue Suede News, Volumes 46‚Äì53, page 21Big City Blues Magazine, Volume 3, Issue 4, page 32 The duo recorded some sessions (Honeydipper Stomp) as well as standard studio album called Big E Boogie. The LPs were then followed by the 1997 Christmas album 12 Days of Christmas. Their song, \\"Rock, Santa, Rock\\", was featured in the 2001 film I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. Speedtwinn In 1998, Twinn teamed with Derwood and formed an alternative country band, Speedtwinn, along with Mario Barmosca and Dale S. Daniel. With a range of influences from T. Rex to Johnny Cash, Speedtwinn played a blend of American roots and British rock and roll. Gary Twinn and Bob \\"Derwood\\" Andrews wrote and recorded the self-produced album California. The International Swingers The band Supernaut reformed in 2007 for a successful Australian Countdown tour. When approached in 2011 to repeat this, Twinn instead opted to invite his close pals Clem Burke, James Stevenson and Glen Matlock to form a band with the sole intention of playing Australian dates. Naming themselves The International Swingers the group played a Los Angeles warm up show in November 2011 and flew directly to Australia for shows in Melbourne, Geelong, Sydney and Adelaide. During rehearsals and the Australian tour they got along well and The International Swingers continued. In 2012 ‚Äì 2014 the band performed tours in California and in 2013 a sold out show in London. Initially they played a set of the greatest hits of all the bands they've been in, but soon they began writing new songs for The International Swingers, like \\"FBI\\" (included in the soundtrack of the film Homefront), Via PledgeMusic, the band raised the money to record their first full-length self- titled album, The International Swingers (originally under the working title Whatever Works Now). The album was recorded at Studio 606 in LA which is owned by the Foo Fighters. It was then mixed by Peter Walsh who has worked with Simple Minds, Pulp and most recently Scott Walker.

According to the acting governor of Panjshir, Abdul Rahman Kabiri, these avalanches were the worst Afghanistan had seen in three decades. Cause  The avalanches were caused by heavy snowstorms in the area. Heavy snowfall is a common cause of avalanches. Snow builds up as snowfall continues and it eventually reaches a point at which the weight of the snowfall overcomes the cohesion of the snow, resulting in an avalanche. Rising temperatures may have also had an effect, due to the fact that temperature rise can affect the cohesion of snow.

It was split off from Victoria Falls National Park in 1979 and is in size. The park is bisected by a road to Kazungula, dividing it into a riverine side and a Chamabonda Vlei side. Most of the park is within the ecoregion of Zambezian and Mopane woodlands, while a small portion in the south is within the Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands.Zambezi National Park, Victoria Falls River Lodge Fauna The Zambezi National Park plays host to a wide variety of larger mammals including African elephant, lion, Cape buffalo and leopard. In addition to these charismatic members of the \\"big 5\\" there are herds of sable antelope, common eland, common zebra, Southern giraffe, greater kudu, waterbuck and impala. In addition, many species of smaller wildlife can be seen here. Over 400 species of birds have been recorded within the Zambezi National Park. Pel's fishing owl, African skimmer, collared palm thrush, lanner falcon, goliath heron, African finfoot, rock pratincole and long-toed lapwing are considered to be among the speciality birds of the park. Aside from birds and land animals, there are 75 species of fish located in the park, including the famous tiger fish. The small (but very scenic) Zambezi National Park is a great destination for a day trip from Victoria Falls since it is located next to it. There are also several lodges overlooking the Zambezi River inside the park offering a real bush experience. Elephant and buffalo are regularly seen, as well as giraffe and zebra.There is a good variety of antelope including water buck, impala and sable. Access The easiest way to access the Zambezi National Park is via the Zambezi River Game Drive, which is extensive network of roads along the banks of the Zambezi and is accessed through the main gate. There is a 25 kilometre Chamabondo Game Drive that can take the visitor into the wilder the southern part of the Park, and which starts 5 kilometres south of Victoria Falls town; just off the main Victoria Falls to Bulawayo road.

It was first applied clinically in humans in 1987 after extensive animal studies. A polar body is a small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally does not have the ability to be fertilized. After sampling of a polar body, subsequent analysis can be used to predict viability and pregnancy chance of the oocyte, as well as the future health of a person resulting from such a pregnancy. The latter use makes it a form of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities.\\"Delivery of a chromosomally normal child from an oocyte with reciprocal aneuploid polar bodies\\". Scott Jr, Richard T., Nathan R. Treff, John Stevens, Eric J. Forman, Kathleen H. Hong, Mandy G. Katz-Jaffe, William B. Schoolcraft. Journal of Assisted Reproductive Genetics Vol. 29 pp. 533-537. 2012. Techniques The first polar body is removed from the unfertilised oocyte, and the second PB from the zygote, shortly after fertilization. The biopsy and analysis of the first and second polar bodies can be completed before fertilization, which is the moment from which the zygote is generally considered an embryo and may become protected by law. By screening the first polar body for chromosomal anomalies, non-viable eggs can be reliably identified, though eggs with normal first polar bodies can still be affected by errors. This method was initially performed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), then by hybridizing a sample into lymphocytes to observe it in metaphase, and more recently by microarrays, which are fully automated and make it easier to distinguish between chromosome vs. chromatid abnormalities.\\"Is the polar body approach best for pre-implantation genetic screening?\\" Delhanty, Joy. Placenta Vol. 32, pp. 268-270. 2011. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies. It is generally agreed that it is best to analyse both polar bodies in order to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis. This can be achieved by sequential biopsy, necessary if monogenic diseases are diagnosed, to be able to differentiate the first from the second polar body, or simultaneous biopsy if FISH is to be performed. In theory, molecular analysis of polar bodies may include epigenetic profiling in the near future. Target diseases =Aneuploidy= Several studies have suggested that polar body screening for aneuploidy may not be optimal. When the majority of errors occur in chromatids rather than entire chromosomes (a condition correlated with the age of the mother), screening only the first polar body will fail to detect a large percentage of defective eggs. As mentioned earlier, chromosomal abnormality in the first polar body can result in a healthy embryo, meaning that eggs may in fact be wasted as a result of the screening. Polar body testing will also be unable to detect post-zygotic errors in an oocyte. Because euploid polar bodies contain the same chromosomes as the oocyte, they can be used as a source of genetic material that is easily accessed without destroying the egg. This presents a research advantage by minimizing damage to the oocytes under investigation. Usage Polar body biopsy is used mainly by two PGD groups in the USA and by groups in countries where cleavage-stage embryo selection is banned.

(1819-1908) was a journalist, editor, newspaper proprietor and politician of the Cape Colony. He was a lifelong supporter of British imperial expansion, and used the name \\"Limner\\" in most of his writings. The Cape Monitor (1854-1856) Murray was born in London in 1819. In his youth, Murray worked for several newspapers in London, before he arrived in Cape Town in 1854 and immediately began work as editor of the reactionary Cape Monitor. In this capacity, he attended and reported on the early sessions of the new Cape Parliament as one of two observer newspapers (the other being the liberal Commercial Advertiser and Mail). He quickly acquired a reputation for enormous personal and political bias, predominantly against any form of local government. In a strange turn of affairs, the editor of the competing Commercial Advertiser and Mail was also an elected MP in the parliament and Murray's reporting on Fairbairn was notorious for its vitriol. He was also one of the leading journalistic attackers of the speaker Christoffel Brand and the MP Saul Solomon. He compiled a large number of sketches and reminiscences that provide a large portion of the early history of the Cape Parliament.Kilpin, R.: The Old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly. Cape Town: T.M. Miller, 1918. The Cape Argus (1856-1862) He founded the Cape Argus, with Bryan Henry Darnell and Saul Solomon, in 1856. However he and Darnell swiftly became relatively unpopular, as their fiercely pro-imperialist political views antagonised the Cape public, who were predominantly supportive of \\"Responsible Government\\" (locally elected democracy) and its leader John Molteno. Darnell and Murray therefore left the Cape Argus (in 1859 and 1862 respectively), with Saul Solomon taking over and bringing the paper into accord with public opinion and into a period of enormous growth. The Great Eastern (1863-1866) The Eastern part of the Cape Colony was traditionally far more pro-imperialist in its politics, and the British Governor Philip Wodehouse moved there to garner support against the growing Responsible Government movement. He took Murray with him for media support, and Murray started the Great Eastern newspaper to support the pro-imperialist party accordingly. He also briefly stood for the constituency of Cradock in 1865, in the Cape Parliament. However, in the ensuing parliamentary sessions, Molteno's Responsible Government party outmaneuvered the Governor's party and its Eastern Cape supporters, and the Government was forced to return to Cape Town. The Great Eastern also faltered and eventually was forced to close in September 1866. In an unusual turn of events, this paper was later re-opened by new owners as The Eastern Star but in fact came to be taken over by the Cape Argus which Murray had originally left in Cape Town. It eventually moved to Johannesburg. Griqualand West (1866-1908) In 1866 Murray returned to Cape Town, where he briefly edited the Standard and Mail. However he left for Griqualand West in the same year, and settled down in what is now Kimberley. He had a great interest in mining, and the great diamond rush was at the time underway. There, he edited the pro- British publication Diamond News, which he used to attempt to prevent a similar movement for self-government appearing in Griqualand West. In this aim, it was squarely opposed to the pre-existing Diamond Field paper of Alfred Aylward. In 1884, the new Diamond Times newspaper opened, with Murray as editor. While officially owned by a \\"Woolf Joel\\", the paper was in fact owned and directed by the diamond magnate Barney Barnato. It was therefore used for public attacks on Barnato's opponents. This brought it into conflict with Cecil Rhodes, who was at the time taking over control of the diamond fields from Barnato. Soon afterwards, Murray returned to Cape Town. Family He married Letitia Murray (d.1886) from Bristol, and they had three children (Richard William Murray Jnr., C. H. Murray and Frank Murray). His son, Richard William Murray Jnr., was later to return to Cape Town and take over editing the Standard and Mail. In 1876, he also founded the Cape Times together with editor Frederick York St Leger and several other partners. While still sympathetic to British imperialism, Murray Jnr. was a great deal more moderate in their expression than his father, and was accordingly more popular with the local readership of these publications.

Life The son of Henry Pickworth, a farmer of New Sleaford, Lincolnshire, he was born there about 1673, and was in business in Sleaford as a tanner. After joining the Quakers, he was appointed an elder and overseer by the Waddington monthly meeting. Hearing that Francis Bugg proposed coming, at the instigation of the bishop, to confute the Quakers in Lincolnshire, Pickworth sent him a challenge to visit Sleaford, and hold with him an open dispute. Bugg arrived 11 August 1701, and on 25 August the conference was held in the sessions house, before justices and clergymen. Pickworth was thought to have performed disappointingly, and Bugg was given a certificate, dated 11 March 1702, that he had made good his charges. Two Quaker books were publicly burned in the market-place. Both disputants issued their own version of the conference, and Pickworth then attacked Bugg in pamphlets. Pickworth was soon after completely won over to Bugg's views, and began writing against the Quakers. He went repeatedly to the yearly Quaker meeting held in London in May and June, to present addresses, protests, and \\"testimonies\\", but was generally refused an audience. At last, on 9 June 1714, he was disowned by the quarterly meeting of Lincoln for supporting the Camisards. Pickworth vainly petitioned the Lords and Commons for another public conference. He moved to Lynn Regis, Norfolk, before 1738, when he issued a defence of his indictment against the Quakers. He died at Lynn some time after that date. Works Among other pamphlets, Pickworth issued A Charge of Error, Heresy, Incharity, Falshood, Evasion, Inconsistency, Innovation, Imposition, Infidelity, Hypocrisy, Pride, Raillery, Apostasy, Perjury, Idolatry, Villainy, Blasphemy, Abomination, Confusion, and worse than Turkish Tyranny. Most justly exhibited, and offered to be proved against the most noted Leaders, &c.;, of the People called Quakers, London, 1716. Pickworth sought to show that all Quakers were papists, and that William Penn died insane. His book provoked replies from Joseph Besse and Richard Claridge. In his writings the influence of Thomas Crisp, George Keith and Charles Leslie is seen, as well as Bugg's arguments. In 1730 Pickworth sent another expostulatory letter to the yearly Quaker meeting, which he printed on their refusal to read it. Family He married, on 28 March 1696, Winifred, daughter of John Whitchurch (died 1680) of Warwick Lane, London, by whom he had five sons, all born at Sleaford. His widow remained a Quaker minister until her death at Lynn, 1 May 1752.

A feminist media studies scholar, Sawchuk's research spans the fields of art, gender, and culture, examining the intersection of technology into peoples lives and how that changes as one ages. Early life and career Kimberly Anne Sawchuk was born in 1960 in Canada. She earned her bachelor's degree in 1982 from the University of Winnipeg, with gold medal honors for a dual-major in Political Science and History. She completed both a Master's in 1986 and her PhD in Social and Political Thought in 1991 from York University in Toronto. Sawchuk joined the Department of Communication Studies at Concordia University in 1990 and by 2011 was an associate professor. On 1 January 2015, she began serving as Associate Dean of Research and Graduate Studies for the Faculty of Arts and Science at Concordia. She has been writing articles on the cultural impact of aging and technology since 1992, and examines cultural attitudes towards aging. Sawchuk has noted that if elderly people are portrayed in advertising at all, they are portrayed primarily as caricatures of their youth. Not who they are, but who they once were. However, she believes that as marketers and advertisers educate themselves about seniors, targeting older markets can be lucrative. She's also involved in changing the popular image of the elderly and works in collaboration with community organizations and activists to address their experience of digital technologies. Sawchuk has participated in a wide number of research projects. In 2010, she was involved in a project on mobile communications and biomedical imaging. In 2011, Sawchuk and Barbara Crow conducted a research project sponsored by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada on whether services, which are frequently geared to on-line access, are accessible to marginalized or older citizens. Often exploring feminist issues, Sawchuk's interests are not limited to feminism. In 2012, she developed a smartphone application with film producer Katarina Soukup, which allows users to uncover geographical and historical landmarks using the GPS systems on the phone, becoming virtual underground explorers. Sawchuk began participation in 2014 in a two-year trans-cultural project between Canada and the European Union called \\"Performigrations: people are the territory\\". The project is designed to study cultural change and diversity, modern mobility, and the spread of ideas. In 2014, Sawchuk received a grant of approximately $3 million to research, over a seven-year period, the topic Ageing, Communication, Technologies (ACT): Experiencing a Digital World In Later Life. The project brings together collaborators from 12 international universities to study the use of technology by aging people and how that changes their world and views of the world. In addition to research, Sawchuk has lectured internationally and participated in seminars at the University of Bologna, Drexel University, Istanbul Bilgi University, Lancaster University, the University of Manchester and University of Silesia, Poland. Sawchuk co-founded the Mobile Media Lab (York-Concordia) in 2006 She is also the organizer of the Critical Disability Studies Working Group at Concordia and works in collaboration with artists and scholars to document and critically examine ableism in cities such as Montreal, Quebec. As part of her work on disabilities, Sawchuk is developing an archive with Arseli Dokumaci funded by the Canadian Consortium on Performance and Politics in the Americas (CCPPA) on performance and disability throughout the Americas. In addition to her academic research, she co-founded of StudioXX, a digital media center in Montreal where feminist academics, artists, and community activists gather in 1996.  Work as editor  She completed a six-year term as the editor of the Canadian Journal of Communications (www.cjc-online.ca) in 2011 and she is the co-editor of Wi: Journal of Mobile Media.

A graduate of City College of New York and Columbia University, Havens worked with James Rainwater on the construction of a neutron spectrometer, which became the subject of his doctoral thesis. During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project, the effort to create the first atomic bombs, in its Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Havens was awarded his doctorate in 1946 after his thesis was declassified. He spent the rest of his career at Columbia University, where he became a full professor in 1955, and was its director of nuclear science and engineering from 1961 to 1977. He was part of the US delegation at the United Nations Atoms for Peace Conferences in Geneva in July and August 1955 and in September 1958, and became a consultant at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1962. He retired from Columbia in 1985, and from then until 1990 was the first full-time CEO of the American Physical Society.  Early life  Havens was born in the Bronx on March 31, 1920, the son of William Havens Sr., a civil engineer, and Elsie S. Nedle, a schoolteacher. He had an older sister, Marjorie, who became a lawyer. He was a descendant of Jonathan Nicoll Havens, a politician who served in the United States Congress from 1795 to 1799. He was educated at Evander Childs High School, from which he graduated in 1935 at the age of 15. His father wanted him to enter Columbia University, his own alma mater, but Columbia would not accept his on account of his age. He therefore entered the City College of New York, which he attended on a scholarship. While there he was on the swimming team, and served in the ROTC, reaching the rank of cadet captain. During the summer of 1938 he was a lifeguard at the ROTC camp. The following year he worked as a lifeguard at Jones Beach Island. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1939, majoring in mathematics and chemistry. In 1939, Havens entered Columbia University, where he studied physics, taking classes on mechanics with George B. Pegram, atomic physics with Isidor Isaac Rabi and electromagnetism with Shirley L. Quimby. He was awarded his Master of Arts degree in 1941. He then began working on his doctorate under the supervision of John R. Dunning. Fellow graduate students in physics at the time included James Rainwater, Herbert L. Anderson and George Weil. He worked with Rainwater on the construction of a neutron spectrometer. His thesis, on \\"Slow neutron cross sections of indium, gold, silver, antimony, lithium and mercury as measured with a neutron beam spectrometer\\", was classified. Manhattan Project The physics faculty at Columbia were drawn into what became the Manhattan Project, the effort to create the first atomic bombs, which accelerated after the United States entered World War II in December 1941. Fermi and Anderson carried out studies of neutrons emitted by fission, while Dunning began investigating isotope separation. Havens and Rainwater attempted to measure the time it took for fission to occur. That found it was less than a microsecond, which was the smallest time that they could measure. They analyzed samples of uranium that Robert R. Wilson's team at Princeton University had attempted to separate the isotopes using a device called the \\"isotron\\". They reported that the degree of enrichment was slight, and the process was eventually abandoned. Wilson's group was transferred to the Los Alamos Laboratory. Fermi's reactor group also left Columbia, as Arthur Compton consolidated the Manhattan Project's reactor project at the Metallurgical Laboratory. Those that remained at Columbia became the Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories, under the direction of Harold Urey, which was mainly concerned with isotope separation for uranium enrichment. Havens and Rainwater also devised a means of measuring residual hydrogen in fluorocarbons, a subject of great interest because uranium hexafluoride gas was being considered for use in isotope separation processes. Havens, Rainwater and Chien-Shiung Wu worked on the development of radiation detector instrumentation, and studies of neutron cross sections using the neutron spectrometer. This included work with plutonium. After the war ended in August 1945, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published. This included his PhD thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate after it was published, along with Rainwater's, in the Physical Review in 1946. Later life Havens spent the rest of his career at Columbia University, where he became a full professor in 1955, and was its director of nuclear science and engineering from 1961 to 1977. In the immediate post-war period, Columbia built a powerful 400 MeV synchrotron, which became operational in 1950, at the Nevis Laboratories, on an estate on the Hudson River at Irvington, New York, willed to Columbia University by the DuPont family. To learn about cyclotrons, Havens spent some time with Emilio Segr√®'s group at the University of California, Berkeley. Havens used the Nevis synchrotron to produce neutrons as part of an Atomic Energy Commission project to see if plutonium could be produced without a nuclear reactor, as it was believed at the time that uranium was scarce. The project eventually evolved into the Materials Test Accelerator at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory; but it never served its intended purpose, as uranium was found to not be a scarce as first thought. From 1948 until the 1970s, Havens served with the AEC Neutron Cross-sections Advisory Group. This led to his being a part of the US delegation at the United Nations Atoms for Peace Conferences in Geneva in July and August 1955 and in September 1958. Havens pressed the AEC to release more information on neutron cross-sections, but was thwarted by its chairman, Lewis Strauss, who explained, \\"We‚Äôve got to keep something secret\\". The work with neutrons led to Havens becoming a consultant (later called \\"visiting staff member\\") at Los Alamos in 1962. He would attend occasional meetings at Los Alamos during the academic year, and spend a couple of weeks there during the summer. At the time there was considerable interest in neutron weapons. In 1985, Havens retired from Columbia and became the first full-time CEO of the American Physical Society (APS), the largest professional physicists' body in the world. He retired from this in 1990. He oversaw the APS a period of considerable growth, and worked with Vera Kistiakowsky to promote the role of women in science. Havens died from complications related to leukaemia in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital on June 29, 2004. He was survived by his wife Aldine, daughters Nancy and Cynthia, and sister, Marjorie.

He is also the subject of a 2015 feature-length documentary film of the same name produced by Smith & Nasht. A former tunnel-digger and resident of Sydney, Pratzky moved to Queensland in his thirties. He describes himself as an \\"accidental\\" activist who only started campaigning against fracking after seeing the encroachment of the coal seam gas industry on rural farming communities. Pratsky is not affiliated with any political party and has said that he will work with anyone who gets results. Pratzky believes that the unconventional gas industry puts clean air and water resources in Australia at risk, and argues that exporting gas puts upwards pressure on domestic gas prices. He also believes that employment opportunities have been overstated by the industry and by Government and that payments made to landholders have not been equitable, given that affected properties have in some cases been rendered unsaleable.  Activism  Pratzky bought a 100 hectare block of land in the Wieambilla estates near Tara in what farmers call \\"goanna country\\" in 2004. In 2005 he was employed on Lane Cove Tunnel project in New South Wales where he sustained a back injury. He began receiving worker's compensation payments, and has been limited in his employment prospects since, despite having a strong will to work. What has been described as Queensland's most disadvantaged community became his home. There, Pratzky observed the community becoming divided and disenchanted as gas wells were established by QGC, a company later acquired by British Gas. He was presented with a land access agreement by QGC in 2009 and subsequently tore it up. He learned of health complaints suffered by children including nose-bleeds and headaches which locals believed were caused by the industry's impacts on air and groundwater quality. In April 2009, Pratzky organised a four-day blockade of trucks and committed himself to anti-coal seam gas activism. He was trained in non-violent protest techniques by Drew Hutton, founder of Lock the Gate and a former Greens candidate. Kjerulf Ainsworth, son of pokie king Len Ainsworth, provided financial support for lawyers and equipment. In 2010 and 2011, Pratzky toured the anti-fracking documentary film Gasland by American filmmaker Josh Fox. He screened the film across the eastern states of Australia, covering a distance of 170,000 kilometres and reaching audiences ranging in size from 16 people to 128. Pratzky was interviewed by Fox when he visited Tara and later appeared in the sequel ‚Äî Gasland Part II. Pratzky has also visited the United States with politician Jeremy Buckingham to see the industry's impact there. In 2012, Pratzky brought national media attention to the occurrence of gas bubbles leaking from the bed of the Condamine River. In 2015, Dayne moved to Smiths Lake, Forster in New South Wales where he has said he will continue to campaign against coal seam gas until a statewide ban is established. Pratzky has also considered a possible future in politics, but acknowledges his lack of formal education and financial backing as potential barriers. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: \\"I do know what it's like to be screwed over by the people who are there to protect us. To be totally honest, I'd relish the opportunity.\\" Pratzky worked with the Frack Free NT Alliance and in 2015 supported their calls for the Darwin Festival to reject sponsorship offers from oil and gas company Santos, due to the company's involvement in shale gas development in the Northern Territory. Pratzky has suffered multiple break-ins to his property, vandalism to his car and the poisoning of his dogs ‚Äî occurrences he has attributed to his opposition to the coal seam gas industry. In June 2016, Pratzky indicated that he would run in the 2017 Mid-Coast Council election as an independent.  Early life  Pratzky was born in New South Wales and describes himself as having been \\"a total ratbag in school.\\" As a teenager, he worked at butchery and spray painting. He also worked as a commercial diver, despite lacking formal qualifications. He secured a job on the Parramatta rail link project by visiting the project's site office uninvited, each morning, for three consecutive weeks.

Biography Whettam was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, and studied at St Luke's College, Exeter. Though he never formally studied at a music school and was largely self-taught, several of his compositions had already been performed by major orchestras and soloists by his twenties. These include the Sinfonietta for Strings in 1951 at Kensington Palace; the Symphony No. 1 in the early 1950s by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Groves; the Concertino for oboe and string orchestra at the 1953 Proms performed by oboist L√©on Goossens; and the Viola Concerto in 1954 at the Cheltentham Festival by violist Harry Danks and conductor Sir John Barbirolli. Other of his works had already been performed with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra by conductors Basil Cameron, Meredith Davies, Sir Eugene Goossens, Willem van Otterloo, and Sir Malcolm Sargent, and by oboist Janet Craxton, clarinettist Jack Brymer, and horn player Dennis Brain. In 1959, the premiere of his first clarinet concerto was performed by Raymond Carpenter and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Groves; this he considered his first mature work. He was married to Rosemary Atkinson from 1948 until their divorce in 1958, at which time he moved to Coventry. While there, he married Janet Lawrence in 1959, and later founded and directed his own publishing company, \\"Meriden Music\\". In 1962 he wrote his first work to be critically considered a \\"masterpiece\\", Sinfonia contra timore (Symphony Against Fear), which was premiered three years later by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conductor Hugo Rignold. Though Sinfonietta Stravagante (1964), performed by the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Hubert Soudant, and Sinfonia Concertante (1966), performed by the Northern Sinfonia and conductor Bryden Thomson, followed in rapid succession, Whettam did not continue to have the success of his youth; several of his works were premiered/published some time after their composition (cf. below), and some of his later works (such as the Promethean Symphony and the Symphony No. 5) still wait for a world premiere. Regarded as \\"a natural symphonist\\" by the Sunday Times, the dozen symphonies he composed between his mid-twenties and death form the core of Whettam's output. However, he also contributed some large-scale concertos, several shorter orchestral (both symphonic and concertante) works, numerous chamber and instrumental works (such as four string quartets and three solo violin sonatas), as well as vocal and choral works. His music, labelled as \\"invariably dramatic\\" (a characterization reflected in his titles: Sinfonia Drammatica; Concerto Drammatico; Concerto Ardente; Sinfonia Intrepida), features skillful construction and a deep sense of poignancy and atmosphere. In 1994 Whettam moved with his wife Janet to Woolaston in Gloucestershire where he continued to compose and where he died on 17 August 2007, aged 79.  Works =Symphonies= Several of Whettam's symphonies have never been published and others were premiered/published many years after their compositions, causing numbering inversions/omissions in past chronologies.

He represented the seat of Barcoo from 1892 to 1893. Ryan was from Fremantle in Western Australia, where he had been educated by the Christian Brothers. He first worked in the pearling industry, but moved to Cooktown, Queensland in 1876. He variously worked as a \\"packer, digger, shearer, butcher, fencer, drover and storekeeper\\". While shearing in Queensland, Ryan became involved in the nascent trade union movement, initially as shed representative. He subsequently worked as a union organiser after being refused employment due to his union activities, rising to become secretary of the Queensland Labourers' Union. Ryan was secretary of the strike committee in the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, organising resistance at Barcaldine, Clermont and Winton. He was one of the leaders arrested and tried at Rockhampton, but unlike most of the leaders, was acquitted. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at an 1892 by-election for the seat of Barcoo following the death of MP Frank Murphy, becoming one of the first Labor MPs in Australia with the support of the unions and the new Labor Party. However, he was disendorsed by the Labor Party for the 1893 election, retired from politics, and returned to being a shearer.

It is dedicated to Saint Theodore of Amasea. History The monastery was financed by Anastasie Ciufli (1801 - 1870) to respect the last will of his brother Teodor Ciufli (1796 - 1854). The two brothers were Aromanian merchants who emigrated from Macedonia to Bessarabia in 1821. Anastasie was authorised to start the construction of the church for his brother in 1854, it was finally consecrated on June 6, 1858. Teodor's remains were placed in the south wing of the building, his brother eventually joined him in their final resting place after his own death 11 years later. In 1962, many churches of the Moldavian SSR were closed or their purpose changed. The main church of Chi»ôinƒÉu, the Nativity Cathedral suffered the same fate by being transformed into an exhibition building. Thus the head of Moldova Church had to be moved to the then monastery of Ciuflea, which was granted of the status of cathedral and renamed according to its benefactor. In 2002, about a decade after the breakup of the Soviet Union, it became a monastery. Sources * * Catedrala episcopalƒÉ Sf. Teodor Tiron =Gallery= Image:Catedrala Sf.

Acerbis lived as a Franciscan beggar and as a religious who provided spiritual advice and consolation to a number of people that included Leopold V and his wife. He was beatified in Bergamo on 21 September 2013 in which Cardinal Angelo Amato presided on the behalf of Pope Francis. Life Tommaso Acerbis was born in 1563 to poor parents and he worked as a shepherd as a child without ever having received proper schooling. He joined the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 12 September 1580 in Verona at the convent of Santa Croce di Cittadella where - aged seventeen - he learnt how to read and write. He made his solemn profession on 5 July 1584 and served in the convents in Verona (1605‚Äì12) and Vicenza (1612-17) as well as Rovereto (1617‚Äì18). He was later sent to Padua in 1618 as the convent's porter, while not long after in 1619 he was sent to a new province of the order in Austria at the request of the archduke Leopold V. Out of those convents he visited the sick people and also helped the poor. He often encouraged and championed a love of the faith to those who listened to him. When Lutheranism began to take root in the area he spoke out and also wrote in defense of the Roman Catholic Church. He chose not to confront but to instead speak on his love of 'the impassioned Christ' and the church that He founded. In Vicenza he had sponsored the opening of a convent for the Poor Clares which from 1612-3 was built at Porta Nuova. At Rovereto he sought permission from city authorities to make another convent for the Poor Clares which was built in 1642 and it was there that he met and spiritually guided the Servant of God Bernardina Floriani while in 1617 became a friend and the spiritual director of the scientist Ippolito Guarinoni. He was also a spiritual guide to the archduke and his wife Claudia de' Medici and Acerbis frequently met and corresponded with the two. He died in mid-1631 in Innsbruck. His remains are housed in Innsbruck. =Papal veneration= Pope John XXIII was noted for having enjoyed the writings of the late Franciscan and even said that he was \\"a saint and a true master of the spirit\\". The pontiff received a gift from Doctor Joseph Mitterstiller from Innsbruck on 24 November 1959 which was a book of the spiritual writings of the late friar, and the pope's private secretary Loris Francesco Capovilla later wrote of the occasion and said that the pope had \\"declared his great esteem and veneration\\" for him. Capovilla later wrote that on 20 May 1963 the dying pope asked that Capovilla, the pope's nurse, Fra Federico Bellotti and the two helpers Guido and Giampaolo Gusso read for him on his deathbed the late friar's works amongst others. Pope Paul VI also spoke of his esteem for Acerbis. Beatification Statue in Olera. The stages of the beatification process commenced on 28 February 1967 in an informative process that concluded its work on 19 April 1968 with the Positio dossier later submitted to Rome in March 1978. This occurred despite the fact that the formal introduction of the cause was not granted until 4 December 1980 with the declaration of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against). Theologians approved all his spiritual writings on 12 February 1974 while historians also approved the course of the cause - and deemed no historical obstacles existed - on 7 March 1979. The diocesan process was later validated on 28 May 1982 which led to theologians approving the cause on 2 December 1986 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints following this decision as well on 30 September 1987. He was proclaimed Venerable on 23 October 1987 after Pope John Paul II recognized his life of heroic virtue. An alleged miracle led to a diocesan tribunal from 26 October 2006 to 4 October 2007 to investigate and later submitted its findings to the C.C.S. who validated the process on 16 January 2009. A medical board issued their approval to it on 24 February 2011 while theologians likewise approved it on 22 October 2011 as did the C.C.S. on 7 February 2012. Pope Benedict XVI issued the final approval needed for it on 10 May 2012 and Cardinal Angelo Amato - on the behalf of Pope Francis - celebrated the beatification mass in Bergamo on 21 September 2013. The current postulator assigned to this cause is Fra Carlo Calloni.

Kamen's artwork is influenced and inspired by scientific work in many areas, from medieval alchemical manuscripts to the periodic table, to theories of black holes. Informed by science, her works attempt to illuminate its hidden beauty. Kamen is professor emeritus at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) where she taught for over 35 years. She continues to be involved with STEM education and consulting nationally. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and her works are included in many private and public collections. She has received a number of awards and honors. Early life and education Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kamen experienced difficulty in both school and college because of dyslexia, which was not diagnosed until much later in her life. Dyslexia is a neurological condition that causes difficulties in reading and mathematics, but may enhance some visual processing abilities. Kamen was fascinated by science, but her difficulties with reading and math convinced her not to pursue a scientific career. College counselors questioned whether she was intelligent enough to attend college, and she was admitted on probation. She chose to study art education at Pennsylvania State University in part because it did not require classes in math, a subject that is often difficult for dyslexic people. Kamen earned a B.S. in art education from Pennsylvania State University in 1972. Creating artwork enabled Kamen to use haptic skills, engaging her sense of touch to perceive and remember objects. Kamen went on to receive an M.A. in art education from University of Illinois at Urbana, (1973) and a Master of Fine Arts degree in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 1978. Teaching Beginning in 1978, Kamen taught at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA). In 1985, Kamen made the first of many trips to China. After meeting noted Chinese sculptor Zhao Shu Tong, Kamen began a six-year collaborative cultural exchange project teaching children about science, art, and American and Chinese culture. Many of her subsequent works have been influenced by Chinese and Japanese art and gardens. After more than 35 years, she officially retired from teaching. She continues to be involved with the STEM to STEAM initiative in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. She has organized the Aspiring Science Summer Internship Program (ASSIP) at George Mason University, where summer interns work in cross-disciplinary teams doing hands-on scientific research, and interpret their research artistically. The program emphasizes the commonality of creative work in the sciences and the arts. She has been a consultant for the development of online chemistry courses by Harvard University's Science Media Group. She is a speaker in the USA Science & Engineering Festival's Nifty Fifty speaker series. Awards and honors In 2001 Kamen was awarded a President‚Äôs Sabbatical Award from Northern Virginia Community College. She has been the recipient of a Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Professional Fellowship, a Pollack Krasner Foundation Fellowship, a Strauss Fellowship, an NIH Artist in Residency, VCCS Professional Development Grants, and a Travel Grant from the Chemical Heritage Foundation. In 2011, Kamen received a Chancellor's Commonwealth Professorship from the Virginia Community College System. She has partnered with academic and scientific research institutions throughout the United States, including Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the National Institutes of Health, and George Mason University. In 2012, Kamen was awarded a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health. In 2017 she was an Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation. Artworks Kamen believes that artists and scientists have similar missions, searching for meaningful patterns and attempting to create compelling narratives about invisible worlds. She is interested in the revelatory role of scientific discovery. The following are some of her works: =Divining Nature: An Elemental Garden= Her work Divining Nature: An Elemental Garden transformed the Periodic Table into a sculptural garden of 3-dimensional mylar flowers, arranged in a Fibonnaci-like spiral. Each of the 83 naturally occurring atoms is represented by a flower. Details of each flower's petals convey information about the orbitals of the elements. The mylar orbital petals are supported by fiberglass rods to create pagoda-like 3 forms. The work grew out of a two-year period of research in which Kamen was influenced by Mendeleev's original periodic table, by travels in India and Bhutan, by Buddhist mandalas, and by medieval alchemy books. The full exhibit, with The Platonic Solids, first appeared at the Greater Reston Arts Center, Reston, VA (2009). It has since been acquired by George Mason University Department of Science for permanent installation in the atrium of the science building. =The Platonic Solids= Rebecca Kamen in front of her installation The Platonic Solids at the Chemical Heritage Foundation, 2011 The Platonic Solids was inspired by Plato's conception of the five classical elements: earth, air, fire, water, and ether. In Plato's work Timaeus (ca. 350 BCE), the five forms of matter are related to elemental solids and shapes (the cube, the octahedron, the tetrahedron, the icosahedron, and the dodecahedron). In Kamen's work these regular polyhedra, created from fiberglass rods and sheets of mylar, are held against the larger plane of the wall, demonstrating \\"tension and compression\\". The work appeared in 2011 as part of the exhibit Elemental Matters: Artists Imagine Chemistry, at the Chemical Heritage Foundation, Philadelphia, PA. It was accompanied by a sound component by bio- musician Susan Alexjander, Elements in Descending Order of Creation from Collapsing Stars. The exhibit also included Kamen's sculpture Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Silicon, Phosphorus, Sulfur. =Butterflies of the Soul= In 2012, Kamen was awarded a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health, and spent a summer visiting and talking to scientists in their laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland. That knowledge became the basis for a series of artworks, inspired by the brain, which were shown at the Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Kamen's work, Butterflies of the Soul was inspired by neuroscientist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who won the 1906 Nobel Prize, for his examination of the human nervous system. Cajal observed cells under the microscope, a new approach to the study of the brain and its functions. In Kamen's sculpture, threadlike mylar \\"butterflies\\" perch on intertwining translucent green mylar and acrylic \\"branches\\". The result is reminiscent of neural structures. Kamen's sculpture is inspired by Cajal‚Äôs drawings of Purkinje cells, which are involved in motor control and cognitive functions. Exhibitions Kamen has participated in a substantial number of solo and group exhibitions. Her first solo exhibition was in 1980, at the University of Richmond, Virginia. In 2014, she held a 20-year retrospective solo exhibition at Duke Hall Gallery, James Madison University. Fundamental Forces, an exhibit of sculpture and painting with sound artist Susan Alexjander, focused on the four fundamental forces in physics, is on display at the National Academy of Sciences to July 6, 2015.

Career The band was formed in London in 1985 by Gary Twinn, former singer/frontman of the Australian band Supernaut; the drummer Mark Laff, recently from the band Empire, and the former Puncture bass player Steve Counsel. Shortly after its commencement it recruited the lead guitarist Ian McKean. Counsel soon quit the new band to join The London Cowboys, and was replaced by the bass guitarist Jeff D. Vine. Drawing inspiration from 1950's traditional Rock & Roll artists such as Eddie Cochran, Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent and Johnny Kidd, the new band named itself after the 1957 song Twenty Flight Rock, adopted a rocker style, and wrote old school Rock & Roll/Rockabilly music, blended slightly with a retro punk rock image. The band played gigs in London, performing several dates at The Marquee Club and Mayfair Ballroom. They were subsequently invited to play the BBC's Janice Long show. On 7 July 1985 the band appeared at the free entry Greater London Council's \\"Jobs for a Change\\" music festival in Battersea Park, being driven off the stage by a barrage of bottles, beer-cans and traffic cones from the crowd within a couple of minutes of walking on. In 1985 it released the single \\"Tower Block Rock\\" (ranked #31 for Best Single of the year in Rockerilla Magazine) with ABC Records, and in 1986 the single \\"Johnny 7\\" was released with WEA Records, but both records failed to enter the pop music charts. In March of that same year the song \\"Searching for a Hero\\", was given away for free on the Spools Gold compilation released on cassette with the Record Mirror Magazine. The band performed at Richfield Avenue for the first day of the resumed Reading and Leeds Festivals on 22 August 1986. In 1987 Bernie Rhodes was hired as the band's manager, and secured a contract for it with Epic Records. Rhodes also had McKean replaced by guitarist Danny B. Harvey. The band recorded a series of sessions (compiled by Twinn and Harvey) as well as a studio album entitled Ride. In 1988 the song \\"Black Leather Jacket\\" was released as a single promo (which again failed to chart), with the album's release due to follow in mid-1988. However, in the meantime Epic Records was bought out by Sony, which subsequently dropped the band from the label after a review of its newly acquired holding's acts. Unable to find another record label willing to sign them, Twenty Flight Rockers broke up in 1989. Members * Gary Twinn - lead vocals (1985-1989) * Mark Laff - drums (1985-1989) * Danny B.

Life The son of William Claridge of Farmborough, Warwickshire, he was educated at Farmborough grammar school. In 1666 he became a student at Balliol College, Oxford, moving two years later to St. Mary Hall. While at the university he gained the reputation of being an \\"orator, philosopher, and Grecian\\". He graduated B.A. in 1670, and in the same year was ordained a deacon, being licensed to the curacy of Wardington. Two years later Claridge was ordained priest, and in the following year was presented to the living of Peopleton in Worcestershire. He was there for nearly twenty years, and most of the time kept a grammar school. In 1689 a sermon by Richard Baxter made him dissatisfied with episcopacy, and a visit to London, during which he attended nonconformist services and inquired into church customs, increased this distaste; but he retained his living till 1691. Joseph Besse, his biographer, states that he then became a Baptist. In 1692 Claridge was appointed preacher at the Bagnio, a Baptist meeting-house in Newgate Street, London, and shortly afterwards opened a school in Clerkenwell. Two years later, becoming dissatisfied with Baptist doctrines, he resigned his appointment, and in 1696 joined the Society of Friends, being accepted a minister during the following year. In 1701 he disputed with Benjamin Keach in a coffee house, Christopher Meidel supporting him on the Quaker side. In 1702, while a schoolmaster at Barking, he opposed a church rate and was excused from paying it; but for the next collection his goods were distrained. In 1707 Claridge moved to Tottenham and opened a school, shortly after which an ecclesiastical suit was begun against him for keeping a school without a license. The prosecution was dropped, only to start up a few years later (1708), when a verdict was given against him for ¬£600, he appealed to the court of king's bench, and the fine reduced to ¬£4. During the same year his goods were distrained for tithes. In 1714, when a bill was before parliament to prevent the growth of schism, particularly intended to suppress dissenting academies, Claridge opposed it and wrote tracts to show that it would be oppressive. When the bill became law, however, he made the declaration it required. For the rest of his life Claridge was mainly involved with the affairs of the Society of Friends. He died of a rapid decline in his 74th year, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Bunhill Fields. Works Claridge's major works were: * A Defence of the present Government under King William and Queen Mary, 1689. * A Second Defence of the present Government, 1689. * A Looking-glass for Religious Princes, 1691. These were written while he was rector of Peopleton. * The Sandy Foundation of Infant Baptism shaken, or an answer to a Book entituled \\"Vindic√¶ F≈ìderis,\\" 1695.

Early life William Thomas Winters was born in September 1961, in Connecticut. He earned a bachelor's degree in international relations from Colgate University, followed by an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has dual American and British nationality. Career Winters was appointed co-head of JP Morgan's investment bank along with Steve Black in 2004; Winters was based in London while Black's office was in New York City. Winters earned much credit for helping the investment bank avoid \\"structured products and off-balance sheet vehicles that crippled global markets because they didn‚Äôt make financial sense\\", as well as his leadership in the acquisition of ailing rival investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008. However, Winters was ousted from his position in 2009 amid reports that he wanted to succeed the CEO Jamie Dimon. Black was replaced by Jes Staley who was named the new CEO of the investment bank, although Black stayed on as chairman of that unit until his retirement in 2011. In February 2011, Winters founded the hedge fund Renshaw Bay. He put up half the money, with investors Jacob Rothschild and Johann Rupert putting up the balance. Winters participated in a charity video entitled \\"Life's a Pitch\\" alongside other senior financial managers, which was shown at the Young Vic theatre London in 2013 and raised ¬£250,000. Winters received a CBE in 2013. In February 2015, it was announced that Winters would replace Peter Sands as CEO of Standard Chartered in June 2015. Since he joined Standard Chartered, the share price has fallen over 60%. The unrealistic executive pensions have attracted some investor criticism in 2019. Lastly, some 36 percent of votes cast at StanChart‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting in London were against its 2019 directors‚Äô remuneration report.

It is located on Schooner Head Road on the east side of Mount Desert Island, surrounded by the lands of Acadia National Park. Built in 1912, it is one of the few grand summer estates to survive the island's devastating 1947 fire. It is now owned by the Jackson Laboratory and used as housing for students enrolled in its prestigious Summer Student Program. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history Highseas is set on a bluff overlooking Frenchman Bay south of the main village of Bar Harbor. It is a massive Colonial Revival structure, 2-1/2 stories in height, built out of brick laid in tapestry bond, with a hip roof and a granite foundation; the brick was manufactured in Philadelphia. The roof is topped by a deck with railing, and is pierced by five brick chimneys and numerous dormers with gabled or hipped roofs. The building is roughly rectangular and its block is ten bays in width, with flanking wings of decreasing size. Most of the windows are sash, although the south wing is set up as a solarium with large casement windows. The main entrance is on the west side of the building, sheltered by a single-story portico with Ionic columns and a railing around its top. The entry area is flanked by projecting hip-roof sections. The east side of the building, facing the bay, has a single-story porch extending across the center six bays, supported by an Ionic colonnade. Highseas was designed by local architect Fred Savage and built in 1912 for Rudolph Brunnow, a professor at Princeton University. He sold it in 1924 to Mrs. Eva Van Cortland Hawkes, a wealthy heiress and descendant of Gouverneur Morris. Her heirs donated the property to Jackson Laboratory, which has facilities nearby in Bar Harbor. The laboratory now uses the property as housing for summer students.

Located in the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, it is a ditch dug in 1906-07 without the benefit of heavy equipment in extremely hostile terrain. The ditch was dug by miners engaged in placer mining on the peninsula, and was used to transport water from Imuruk Lake, the largest body of fresh water on the peninsula, to mining areas north of the lake. It is one of a large number of such canals dug on the peninsula, and was one of the longest. At the bottom it was wide, and was hacked out of permafrost, a volcanic field surrounding the lake, and dirt. Cabins built to house workers and monitor water flow survive. The ditch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The Fairhaven ditch is located within two drainage basins, the upper section in that of Kugruk River and the lower section in that of Inmachuk River. The ditch takes its water from Imuruk Lake, which lies at an elevation of about 960 feet above sea level. A dam 500 feet long and 5 feet high was built to form a storage reservoir, and this held the total inflow at the lake for two years if necessary. The ditch is in three sections. The upper section, 17 miles long, lies on top of the lava and extends from the lake around the head of Wade Creek to the divide between Wade Creek and Pinnell River, where the water is dropped into a channel emptying into a sink hole in the lava, apparently connected by an underground passage with Wade Creek. The water is diverted from Wade Creek into Pinnell River by the middle section of the ditch, which is about half a mile long. The distance between the upper and lower ditches is about 6.5 miles, and the drop is estimated at 140 feet. The lower section of the ditch extends from the intake on Pinnell River along the right side of the valley to a point a few hundred feet below Logan Gulch, a small tributary of the Inmachuk above Arizona Creek, and has a length of about 19 miles, making the total length of the ditch 36.5 miles. The ditch has a grade of 4.2 feet to the mile and was built 11 feet wide on the bottom. The grade line was located 1 foot below the surface of the ground on the lower side and a 4-foot lower bank was provided. The removal of 1 or 2 feet of the upper moss and soil put the bottom of the ditch into a mixture of ground ice and muck, much of which was almost clear ice. This material thawed when the water was turned in, and as a result a large part of the bottom of the ditch has settled at least 2 feet and the ditch has widened in many places to 15 or 20 feet or more. As the upper bank thawed, material was thrown against the lower bank to protect it and to keep the water from getting under it. Practically all the upper ditch and at least three-fourths of the lower ditch is built in frozen ground of this character. These sections have been difficult and expensive to maintain and caused considerable interruption in the delivery of water during 1909 and 1910. Where the lower ditch is built around the steep gulches that carry the eastern tributaries of the Pinnell the northerly slopes of the gulches are covered with muck, but the southerly slopes are made up of a more solid clay and of decomposed mica schist. Along the upper ditch lava bowlders are present in the muck from the surface to bedrock, and at a few places the material encountered was composed of angular fragments of lava with only a little soil between them. Above and below Snow Gulch, the lowest tributary of Pinnell River which the ditch crosses, are short pieces of rockwork. The rock is much shattered and could have been loosened with picks if it had not been frozen. Much difficulty was experienced in making the rockwork water tight on account of the lack of good sod, as the surface covering is commonly decayed moss or peat containing much fibrous matter and little earthly material, and will float even though saturated with water, so that it is necessary to weight it down with rocks when it is used on the bottom of the ditch. The ditch was built under contract, and construction was begun early in 1906. The upper section and more than half of the lower section had been built bv October 12, when work had to be suspended for the year. The construction was completed in July, 1907, and water was run through the ditch for a short time in September of the same year. The pressure pipe leading from the penstock below Logan Gulch to the mine has a total length of 10,600 feet and gives a head of 530 feet on bedrock at the Utica group of claims. This head was greater than was found practicable for use, and a second penstock was built to reduce it to 330 feet.

The standard consists of a set of guidelines, requirements, and recommendations that align with best practices for global supply chain security and the integrity of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information and communication technology (ICT) products. It is currently in version 1.1. A Chinese translation has also been published.  Background  The O-TTPS was developed in response to a changing landscape and the increased sophistication of cybersecurity attacks worldwide. The intent is to help providers build products with integrity and to enable their customers to have more confidence in the technology products they buy. Private and public sector organizations rely largely on COTS ICT products to run their operations. These products are often produced globally, with development and manufacturing taking place at different sites in multiple countries. The O-TTPS is designed to mitigate the risk of counterfeit and tainted components and to help assure product integrity and supply chain security throughout the lifecycle of the product. The Open Group's Trusted Technology Forum (OTTF) is a vendor-neutral international forum that uses a formal consensus based process for collaboration and decision making about the creation of standards and certification programs for information technology, including the O-TTPS. In the forum, ICT providers, integrators and distributors work with organizations and governments to develop standards that specify secure engineering and manufacturing methods along with supply chain security practices. The Implementation Guide to Leveraging Open Trusted Technology Providers in the Supply Chain provides mapping between The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and related organizational practices listed in the O-TTPS. NIST referenced O-TTPS in their NIST Special Publication 800-161 \\"Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations\\" that provides guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply chain risks at all levels of their organizations.  Purpose  The standard, developed by industry experts within the Forum, specifies organizational practices that provide assurance against maliciously tainted and counterfeit products throughout the COTS ICT product lifecycle. The lifecycle described in the standard encompasses the following phases: design, sourcing, build, fulfillment, distribution, sustainment, and disposal.  Measurement and Certification  Organizations can be certified for their conformance to the standard through the Open Group's Trusted Technology Provider Accreditation Program. Conformance to the standard is assessed by Recognized third party Assessors. Once an organization has been successfully assessed as conforming to the standard then the organization is publicly listed in the Open Group's Accreditation Register. The third party assessment process is governed by the Accreditation Policy and Assessment Procedures.  History  The effort to build the standard began in January 2010 with a meeting organized by The Open Group and including major industry representatives and the United States Department of Defense and NASA. The Open Trusted Technology Forum was formally launched in December 2010 to develop industry standards and enhance the security of global supply chains and the integrity of COTS ICT products. The first publication of the Forum was a whitepaper describing the overall Trusted Technology Framework in 2010. The whitepaper was broadly focused on overall best practices that good commercial organizations follow while building and delivering their COTS ICT products. That broad focus was narrowed during late 2010 and early 2011 to address the most prominent threats of counterfeit and maliciously tainted products resulting in the O-TTPS which focuses specifically on those threats. The first version of O-TTPS was published in April 2013. Version 1.1 of the O-TTPS standard was published in July 2014. This version was approved by ISO/IEC in 2015 as ISO/IEC 20243:2015. The O-TTPS Accreditation Program began in February 2014. IBM was the first company to achieve accreditation for conformance to the standard. The standard and accreditation program have been mentioned in testimony delivered to the US Congress regarding supply chain risk and cybersecurity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 Section 888 (Standards For Procurement Of Secure Information Technology And Cyber Security Systems) requires that the United States Secretary of Defense conduct an assessment of O-TTPS or similar public, open technology standards and report to the Committees on Armed Services of the US Senate and the US House of Representatives within a year.

H. Kan, was a prominent public figure, statesman and patrician landowner of Peranakan Chinese descent in the Dutch East Indies (today known as Indonesia). He was the founding president of Chung Hwa Hui (CHH), a centre-right Chinese-Indonesian political party, and sat as its leading parliamentary representative in the Volksraad. He advocated cooperation with the Dutch colonial state in order to attain racial and legal equality for the colony's Chinese community, but ‚Äî even in the colonial era ‚Äî was criticised for his pro-Dutch sentiments and perceived elite indifference to poorer Indonesians. Family and early life Kan was born Han Khing Tjiang Sia in Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies, into the heart of the 'Cabang Atas' or the Chinese gentry of Java. His father, Han Oen Lee (1856‚Äî1893), served as Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi, an important administrative post in the colonial bureaucracy, and hailed from one of the oldest and most storied of Java's Chinese lineages, the Han family of Lasem. Through his father, Kan could trace his ancestry in Java back to Han Khee Bing, Luitenant der Chinezen (1749 ‚Äì 1768), the eldest son of the mid-18th century magnate Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727 ‚Äì 1778), and grandson of the founder of the family, Han Siong Kong (1673-1743). As a descendant of a long line of Chinese officers, Kan held the hereditary title of Sia from birth. H. H. Kan (1881‚Äî1951) and his family His mother, Kan Oe Nio (1850‚Äî1910), was one of Batavia's richest heiresses, and daughter of the well- known tycoon and landlord, Kan Keng Tjong (1797‚Äî1871), who was elevated by the Chinese Imperial Government to the rank of mandarin of the third grade. Han Khing Tjiang Sia was adopted by his childless uncle, Kan Tjeng Soen (1855‚Äî1896), and renamed Kan Hok Hoei Sia, and thus became the principal heir of the name and fortune of his maternal grandfather. His adoptive mother and aunt, Khouw Tjoei Nio (1854‚Äî1944), was a daughter of Khouw Tjeng Tjoan, Luitenant der Chinezen (1808‚Äî1880) and an elder sister of Khouw Kim An (1875‚Äî1945), the 5th Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia. Kan had a thoroughly European upbringing, and was schooled at the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS) and the prestigious Koning Willem III School te Batavia (KW III). In addition to his native Malay and fluent Dutch, he was reputed to be conversant in seven other European languages. In 1899, he married his first cousin, Lie Tien Nio (1885‚Äî1944), daughter of Lie Tjoe Hong (1846‚Äî1896), the 3rd Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, and ‚Äî like her husband ‚Äî a grandchild of Kan Keng Tjong. Through his wife, Kan became a brother-in-law of the philanthropist and anti- human trafficking activist Aw Tjoei Lan (1889‚Äî1965; whose husband was a brother of Kan's wife). Kan and his wife had 8 children. Kan applied and obtained legal equality with Europeans (gelijkgestelling) in 1905, after which he was universally known as Hok Hoei Kan or H. H. Kan. Political career A session of the Volksraad. His political career began in the Municipal Council of Batavia and a number of Chinese chambers of commerce (Siang Hwee). When the Volksraad, Indonesia's first legislature, was convened by the Governor-General for the first time, Kan accepted appointment to the newly founded legislative body in 1918. He did so despite widespread opposition to the colonial parliament from many Chinese and indigenous subjects of the Dutch East Indies, many of whom refused to cooperate with the colonial government and campaigned for outright independence. Kan remained a member of the Volksraad until its dissolution by the Japanese, who invaded the colony in 1942 during the Second World War. In 1928, Kan presided ‚Äî as founding President ‚Äî over the formation of Chung Hwa Hui (CHH), a political association that attracted the support of mainly Dutch-educated ethnic Chinese. Together with the likes of his distant cousin, Han Tiauw Tjong, and Loa Sek Hie, who were both on the Executive Committee of CHH, Kan pleaded for legal equality of the Chinese with Europeans under Indies law. Kan also opposed some of the legal disabilities that had been imposed on the Chinese of the colony, such as limitations on ownership of agricultural land and excessive taxation. Nonetheless, CHH was dubbed the 'Packard club' by the colonial press for the expensive cars used by the party's leadership, and was criticised as too elitist and removed from the day-to-day concerns of other Chinese-Indonesians. Kan's relationship with Indonesian nationalists was also ambiguous. In 1927, Kan voted against expanding the franchise for elections to the Volksraad as he feared domination of the legislature by indigenous Indonesians. His pro-Dutch attitude even drew the criticism of Phoa Liong Gie, a leader of CHH's more liberal and pro- nationalist younger faction. Following an open conflict over Kan's apparent dominance of CHH, Phoa resigned from the party and sat as an independent in the Volksraad when eventually appointed to it in 1939. Notwithstanding supposed pro-Dutch sympathies, Kan supported the ill-fated Soetardjo Petition in 1936, which requested Indonesian Independence within ten years as part of a Dutch commonwealth. In 1932, representing Chinese-Indonesian private enterprises, Kan went on a tour of China, and became close to the Chinese Consul-General to the Dutch East Indies. In 1934, the colony's Chinese chambers of commerce federated, and offered the Consul-General the position of honorary president, and Kan that of inaugural president. This drew the ire of the then Governor-General due to the federated group's perceived closeness to the Republic of China, a foreign power, leading to Kan's resignation of his presidency of the chamber. In 1935, Kan went to the Netherlands to promote better relations between the Chinese-Indonesian community and the Dutch authorities. Kan was made an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1921, and a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 1930 in recognition of his service to the Dutch Crown. Japanese occupation and death When the Japanese invaded Java in 1942, they apprehended Kan along with other leaders of the colonial government due to their anti-Japanese activities. Kan was imprisoned in Tjimahi until the Japanese capitulated in 1945. He did not resume political activities after the Second World War, and died at his residence on Jalan Teuku Umar in Menteng in 1951.

It is located in the deanery of Tone, within the diocese of Bath and Wells. It is a Grade II* listed building. Usage The church is part of the Church of England, and forms a combined benefice with a number of other churches around Wiveliscombe, known as Wiveliscombe and the Hills. The churches share the same rector, The Reverend David Widdows, and are within the deanery of Tone, within the diocese of Bath and Wells. The church was a sole benefice until 1929. History and architecture A church has been located in Chipstable at least as far back as the early 11th century, and was recorded in the Domesday Book. The earliest known rector was \\"Stephen, Parson of Cyppestable\\", who was present in 1248. The church of Chipstable was administered by the monks of Muchelney Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. In 1531, the Church of All Saints was dedicated. The church website dates the church tower to around 1239, although the Historic England listing describes it as 15th century. The tower is crenellated, and features what Nikolaus Pevsner describes as \\"handsome capitals of the three-bay arcade\\". Each of the four side of the three-stage tower has demi-figures of angels. The nave was rebuilt in 1869 by Benjamin Ferrey, in red sandstone with hamstone dressings, reusing the stone from the original building where possible. The nave has twin aisles, and a south porch which retains a 15th-century doorway, though the door is 19th century. The building combines Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic styles. The bell tower contained five bells until 1901, when a sixth was added. Two square-headed bench ends were retained when the building was renovated, dating from around 1530, featuring a pestle on one, and a huntsman on the other. A two-storey rectory dates from at least the early 17th century, and was rebuilt and enlarged in 1870. It was sold just over 100 years later, and is now known as \\"The Grange. A new rectory was built in 1975 in replacement. In the churchyard, a group of three chest tombs are Grade II listed; the oldest is from the 17th century, though with 18th century alterations, while the other two are 18th and 19th century respectively. The English Heritage listing noted that all three are damaged, and were overgrown when the survey was carried out. The name of John Hastings is visible on the oldest tomb, but the wording on the others was illegible.

Kuhn's house from 1898 until his death is now called Frassati House, and is the building on Vanderbilt's campus that houses the University's Catholic campus ministry. Kuhn was an active member of the Cathedral of the Incarnation. His mother had also attended the Church of the Assumption. Board of Public Works Kuhn's first job out of college was as the private secretary to Mayor Claiborne Hooper Phillips. His brother Casper was city auditor.http://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0017/VOL_0017_ISSUE_0009.pdf Ferdinand Kuhn was then a secretary and city recorder for the Board of Public Works and Affairs from 1884 until 1903. Upon his resignation he was dubbed \\"beyond question the most capable man that (sic) ever served the Board\\". Knights of Columbus =Initiation= Kuhn was initiated into the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization, in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 1, 1899. He was one of the first five from south of Louisville to be initiated on that day. The other four were: Messrs. H. J. Grimes, Will J. Varley, William Smith, and Michael M. McCormack. =Southern expansion= > Ferdinand Kuhn was one of the Nashville Catholics who had advocated > expansion into Tennessee.

He was appointed Supreme Knight Hearn as the first Territorial Deputy of Tennessee,cf. and in that capacity organized councils in Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Atlanta and Augusta in Georgia; Birmingham, Mobile, and Huntsville in Alabama; Meridian, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; Little Rock and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was once Master of the Fourth Degree for Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, Later he remained Master of the Fourth Degree for Tennessee. He is known as the \\"Father of the Knights of Columbus in the South.\\" =State deputy= Kuhn was the first state deputy of Tennessee from 1902 to 1908. In 1920 he was Grand Knight of Nashville Council 544. Shoe merchant Fifth Ave North, Nashville Kuhn was president and treasurer of the Kuhn, Cooper, Geary & Company shoe store, founded in 1903 with Ed P. Cooper and P. J. Geary. The store was located on North Summer Street (Fifth Avenue North), Nashville. It was once the largest retail shoe store in the South, and earned a reputation as the premiere footwear store in downtown Nashville. The most up-to-date electric lighting and holophone reflectors provided lighting for the store. Its front window displayed shoes on revolving pedestals. The inside walls were marble lined, and inlaid mirrors ran along the back wall. Hub Perdue, a former Major league pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Braves before he managed the Nashville Volunteers, worked briefly at the store in 1921. Kuhn was the president of the Retail Shoe Dealers' Association in 1906, and of the Retail Credit Men's Association in 1920. Nashville Vols The 1908 Nashville Vols. Kuhn is top left. Kuhn was the president of the Nashville Vols baseball club from 1908 to 1910, including the 1908 Southern Association championship team. He was preceded in that capacity by Bradley Walker. Kuhn was head of a group of men who purchased the team after a last place finish in 1907. Along with Kuhn the group consisted of: James B. Carr (president of B. H. Stief Jewelry Co.); Thomas James Tyne (lawyer and state legislator); J. T. Connor (real estate); James A. Bowling (contractor); Robert L. Bolling (lawyer); Rufus E. Fort (physician); and William G. Hirsig (automobile and tire dealer). Well known attorney S. A. Champion supplied legal services. The group envisioned an ambitious project of stadium renovations at Sulphur Dell, and managed to cull $50,000. Kuhn was selected to head the Board of Directors. He went on a trip to Ponce de Leon Park in Atlanta to observe a modern park and plan renovations. =1908-1910= Kuhn hired Bill Bernhard as manager. In 1908 the team won the Southern pennant by beating the New Orleans Pelicans in the last game, described by Grantland Rice as the \\"greatest game ever played in Dixie\\". Nashville entered the final day of that season on September 19 with an opportunity to win the league pennant. The championship would be decided by the last game of the season at Sulphur Dell. Both teams had the same number of losses (56), but the Pelicans were in first place with 76 wins to the Vols' second-place 74. A crowd of 11,000 spectators, including Kuhn, who sat next to Mayor James Stephens Brown, saw Carl Sitton hurl a three-hit, 1‚Äì0 shutout, giving Nashville their third Southern Association pennant by 0.1 percentage points (57.25% to 57.14%). Ted Breitenstein was New Orleans's pitcher. Kuhn (middle) with Southern Association president William Marmaduke Kavanaugh (left) One account reads: \\"By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an eyelash. Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history.\\" The championship banner was presented to Kuhn by league president William Marmaduke Kavanaugh, and it hung over the window of Kuhn's shoe store until the banner raising ceremony on Opening Day, 1909. Kuhn also invented a kind of electric scoreboard. In the 1909 season, New Orleans, Mobile, Montgomery, Memphis, and Atlanta used his design. John Heisman was president of the Atlanta team. Following the 1910 season, Kuhn resigned as the team's president. He was succeeded by Hirsig. Kuhn was always careful with the team's money, and one newspaper called it the end of the \\"tightwad\\" regime. Anti- tuberculosis campaign He was once president of Tennessee's state Anti- Tuberculosis League.

He was a portrait painter, watercolourist, master copier and exhibitor. He was commissioned by many famous Scots of the time, and his paintings were featured at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and were bought and sold worldwide. There are a number of A. Camerons in the 20th-century Scottish art world and another Alexander Cameron. To distinguish himself therefore, he signed all his work to include his third name - Beauchamp - to avoid confusion. Born to William and Mary Isabelle Cameron on 20 June l905 in Leith, Edinburgh, Sandy, as he was known to his friends, was a keen athlete and won many prizes at Boy Scouts sports event which provided the main opportunity to train for athletics in those days. In his late teens, he competed in relay races with Eric Liddell (famed from Chariots of Fire) and ran an exhibition race against him just prior to the Olympics. He was also a successful high-jumper ‚Äì his grandfather, Sandy Dees, had been high jump champion of Scotland. India At the age of 19, Cameron applied for a managerial post in India, ending up with the responsibility of the Malabar Coast under his belt for the Madura Shipping Company, part of the P&O; and BI Lines before his 21st birthday. He married Barbara Girdlestone, who came out to India for a holiday from her home in Kent, and they enjoyed a happy colonial existence filled with sailing and hunting trips in the Nilgiri hills with a staff of over 50 to manage back on the coast. Cameron had to be invalided out of India before he reached his 30th birthday as he was struck down by malaria, followed by a bout of yellow fever, which involved his being shipped home and straight into the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, where it was touch and go for several months. Military Still weak from his increasing bouts of malaria, Cameron recovered slowly, but the moment World War II came, he enlisted into the army even though he had recently started as a mature student at the Edinburgh College of Art. Initially applying for the Royal Scots, he was transferred to the Royal Artillery ‚Äì due to his health problems ‚Äì as a second lieutenant, but very soon became a captain with the defence of the Forth Bridge and the munitions factories at Rosyth very much to the fore. Art Career When he finally graduated from art college after the war, he went on to take his teaching degree at Moray House, and his life from there on became increasingly busy, with three growing children, a farm, and a studio to run in Torphichen Street at Edinburgh's West End as well as a teaching post. During this time, he exhibited on a regular basis at Edinburgh's Royal Academy with two notable portraits: Alasdair, his son, and Sonya, a friend's daughter in i944; The Quarry in 1945; Jean in l947; and Flowerpiece in 1952. By this time he was receiving so many commissions for his work, that he no longer had time to put them forward for exhibition and it seems that from thereon ‚Äì his work went straight out to his many admirers and patrons. As the years rolled by, by which time he had given up the farm at Hillhouse in Kirknewton (1950), he was developing a very classical style, which led to more and more dignitaries from among the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow keen to have their portraits painted. He was also very popular amongst the judiciary and military, painting a number of Scottish generals or clan chiefs due to his skills in painting tartans and robes. He was for several years an art teacher at Melville College Edinburgh where he was extremely popular for his patience and kindness. The following are amongst some of his many sitters and patrons over the years up until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1981: Lord Napier of Thirlestane Castle, Alastair Dunnett (editor of The Scotsman), Lord Provost John Millar, Sir Isaac Wolfston, Lord Rosebury, General Sir Henry Leask and The Earl of Inchcape. Cameron was also called upon to restore or copy a large number of old master paintings from all over Scotland. References External links * Website dedicated to the works of A.G.B.

His service in this position is the longest to date. During his time at Oklahoma State, Low was strongly involved with the construction of the present Edmon Low Library building, the main library of the Oklahoma State University System, named after his contributions to the university. Low was instrumental in having the library staff elevated to faculty status at OSU. One of Low's more notable contributions to the library system was his development of the open stack approach in library service. Early life Edmon Low was born in 1902, before Oklahoma had been granted statehood, to Foster Lafayette Low & Katherine Horton Low in Kiowa Indian Territory. He had one brother, Lee, and graduated from high school in 1920 in Tishomingo, OK. Upon graduation from high school, Low worked at a bank for a short time before enrolling at East Central State College in Ada, OK. Education While attending East Central State College, Low worked in the campus library for a small wage while pursuing his degree in mathematics. He first desired to work in the banking profession upon graduation but his job at the library inspired him to pursue a career in professional librarianship. He graduated from East Central in 1926. For three years after graduation, Low served as the assistant librarian at East Central State College until 1929 when he enrolled at the University of Illinois. There he completed his degree in library sciences in a year. Post graduation, he returned to his job in Ada, OK and served in that position for seven years, during which he was married to Mayme Low and had three children: Frances, Marc, and Don. In 1937, after saving up enough money during the Depression, the Lows moved to Michigan where Edmon enrolled at the University of Michigan to receive his master's degree in 1938. Career Though he intended to return to his position at East Central State College, Low accepted a job at Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1938. He served there for two years, bringing order and innovative methods to their library. In 1940, Low applied for an opening at Oklahoma A.and M.(now Oklahoma State University) where he was soon accepted. That fall when he began working at Oklahoma A.and M., Low directed a staff of 15 professional librarians. Befriending current university president Henry G. Bennett, the two men worked together to drastically improve the campus, specifically with discussion of a new library building. Bennett knew the importance of a library in one's education. When speaking at the opening of a public library he stated, \\"Here one may sit awhile with the great minds of all places and all times .... We may walk and talk with the wise men of all races and all ages. We may view the stirring panorama of human striving that we call history .... Whatever our interest, whatever our mood, we shall find here its counterpart and its minister.\\" Though he shared in the planning of the library's expansion with Low, Bennett died in a plane crash before he could see the realization of their planning. While at Oklahoma A. and M., Low inspired a number of changes in the library system and realized Bennett's dream to transform the Oklahoma Aggies into a major institution. After his retirement at OSU in 1967, Low returned to University of Michigan where he taught full-time for several more years. After his retirement from Michigan, Low and his wife moved to head the library at New College of Florida in Sarasota, FL. =Construction/expansion setbacks of new library building= The new larger library was planned as early as 1928, but suffered many financial setbacks. In 1941, the chairman of the senate appropriations committee called for funding for a new library building, referring to their current one as a \\"firetrap.\\" Although money was allocated for the funding of a new library with the passing of a bill, wartime expenditures put the construction on hold yet again. During the war, Low put himself in charge of the \\"War information center,\\" housed on campus. Oklahoma A. and M.'s information center was one of 140 centers kept on college campuses. After WWII, Quonset huts were erected to house certain parts of library collections as well as provide study space for 500 students. The final selected site for the construction of the library brought with it its own adversity. The construction was set back another two years due to Stillwater merchant's efforts to prevent the college from ending a major city street that went through campus. After many years of frustration, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 28, 1950. The building's dedication took place in May 1953. =Low's changes to library system= Low was instrumental in many changes to the library system. He is most well known for pioneering the open stack concept, one that he put into use at Oklahoma State. While at Oklahoma A. and M. Low was responsible for elevating the library staff to faculty rank, as well as developing a new system for checking out books that was utilized until computerization. Upon his arrival at the developing university, more staff members attended and held membership in the national association of librarians than was done in previous years. Retirement Low did not retire completely, but instead took up congressional lobbying while in his 70s living in Florida. He would commute to Washington D.C. for this purpose from his home in Sarasota. Some of that legislation included helping to pass a bill that gave federal money to libraries. Finally, Low was forced to retire due to health complications and the onset of Alzheimer's disease in Mayme. The class of 1972 at the University of Michigan established the Edmon Low Award in honor of the professor upon his retirement. Low died in 1983 in Tulsa, OK and is buried in Stillwater, OK.

Speaking after his death, Shirley Frimpong- Manso, who directed five of Johnson's films, noted that \\"Bob J\\" had left a lasting influence on the Ghanaian film industry. She also said: ‚ÄúBob was meticulous, professional, creative, a strong pillar of reliability and above all, a big brother and this can be attested by all those who had the privilege to work with him. He was full of life and Great Spirit on and offset; it will never be the same without him.‚Äù The respect for Johnson within the film industry, both by on-screen performers and behind-the-scenes personnel, was such that some film production companies halted production purposely for Johnson's funeral. Some actors deserted production sets which did not stop filming to attend the funeral.
