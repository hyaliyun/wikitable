Rudhraiya in his directorial debut, and co-written by him with Somasundareshwar. The film was produced by Rudhraiya in association with the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. It stars Sripriya, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, while Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's music. The plot revolves around Manju (Sripriya) and the difficulties she faces in her life, due to her romantic relationships, resulting in her developing an aggressive and cynical nature towards men. Aval Appadithan was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Although the film received positive critical reception, it was not a box office success at the time of its release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. Aval Appadithan was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. It received the second prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, while Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the Best Cinematographer award. Additionally, Sripriya received a Special Award for the Best Actress of 1978. In 2013, CNN- News18 included the film in its list, \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\".  Plot  Manju was raised in a dysfunctional family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu, who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun, who has come to Madras from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu. Manju has been drafted by Thyagu to assist Arun in his documentary. As Arun and Manju start working together, Arun begins to understand Manju's complex personality. She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, the ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for the sake of employment, and how her second love, Mano, a Christian priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her \\"sister\\" in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him to steer clear of such women. Inevitably, Arun falls for Manju. However Manju incurs Thyagu's wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character. When Thyagu also comments about her, she resigns from her job. When he learns of this, Arun requests Thyagu to re-employ her. Thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back, after which Manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be. The truth finally emerges that Manju was merely baiting Thyagu to teach him a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl. When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, \\"What do you think of women's liberation?\\". Arun's wife replies that she does not know. Manju cynically replies that this is why she (the wife) is happy. After Manju leaves, the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says that Manju died today, but will be reborn tomorrow, only for the cycle to repeat, and that is how she is.  Cast  * Sripriya as Manju * Kamal Haasan as Arun * Rajinikanth as Thyagu * Sivachandran as Mano * Saritha as Arun's wife  Production  = Development = C. Rudhraiya, whose former name was Aarumugam, was introduced to Kamal Haasan by writer Ananthu. The three shared an interest in the works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. Somasundareshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. It was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. The initial script by Somasundareshwar consisted of two pages. Aval Appadithan was the debut film for both Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekaran, who jointly handled the film's cinematography. Vanna Nilavan co-wrote the screenplay with Somasundareshwar and Rudhraiya. The film was co-produced by Rudhraiya, in association with the students of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. Sripriya, who played Manju, was initially unsure about acting in the film due to her busy schedule at that time, and only agreed to do it on Haasan's insistence. According to Somasundareshwar, the characterisation of Manju was inspired from a woman he met and who had similar radical beliefs. Rajinikanth, who played Thyagu, was convinced by Rudhraiya to join Aval Appadithaan. = Filming = Throughout the film, the cinematography made extensive use of shadows and close up shots to emphasise the moods of the characters. Jump cuts were frequently used as well. Overall, 8,230 metres of film negative was used to make the film, and the team incurred a cost of 20,000 for exterior shooting equipment. The scenes where Arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes, improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops, and shot using the live-recording method. The film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours to lend a surreal atmosphere to it, and none of the actors used make-up. Filming proceeded smoothly as almost all of the dialogues were ready by the time team went for filming the scenes. The camera angles were pre-planned as well. Haasan shot the film in his spare time, as he was involved in over 20 other films as an actor during the production of Aval Appadithan. Before a shot, Haasan discussed the scene with Ananthu and Rudhraiya on how Godard would have done it. The film was shot in two-hour sessions over a period of four-five months. The opening scene where Haasan looks into the camera and says \\"Konjam left-la ukaarunga\\" (Sit a little to the left, please) was meant as a sign to the audience to support gender equality. According to the Tamil newspaper Dinamalar, Aval Appadithan was shot in 20 days.  Themes and influences  Aval Appadithan explores a number of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic attitude of males. Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else for the sake of a job; and the second is Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her \\"sister\\" in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them. Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film. Feminist writer C. S. Lakshmi wrote in her essay \\"A Good Woman, A Very Good Woman\\", that Manju's characterisation was \\"brought out entirely verbally by her\\". Lakshmi believes the film to be constantly resorting to \\"existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that the woman who is different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself.\\" She further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is \\"it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary\\" and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances \\"if only she had a 'proper' mother\\". Artist Jeeva compared Aval Appadithan to other films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as \\"classics that put the spotlight on women.\\" Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a \\"fluid narrative style\\" and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and \\"glossy pictorialism\\". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks \\"what do you think of 'women's liberation'\\", Arun's wife answers, \\"I don't know\\", to which Manju says \\"that is why you are happy\\", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour. Kamal Haasan's character, Arun, is an early version of a metrosexual male sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, is the exact opposite of Arun money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: \\"Women should be enjoyed, not analysed.\\" According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life ‚Äî he too smokes and drinks. According to film critic Naman Ramachandran, Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu \\"a prejudiced ass\\", Thyagu responds by saying, \\"I am a male ass,\\" with the dialogue being in English. His opinion of Sripriya's character, Manju, is seen when he says (also in English), \\"She is a self pitying sex-starved bitch!\\"  Music  Aval Appadithan soundtrack and score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The soundtrack was released under the label of EMI Records. Although Ilaiyaraaja was busy, he agreed to compose for Aval Appadithan at the insistence of Rudhraiya and Haasan. After the recording session of \\"Ninaivo Oru Paravai\\" from Sigappu Rojakkal (1978), Ilaiyaraaja asked Haasan to record \\"Panneer Pushpangale\\" that same afternoon. During the recording session, Ilaiyaraaja suggested that Haasan tone down the opening notes; when Haasan sang perfectly as per his suggestion, Ilaiyaraaja accepted Haasan's next rendition of the song. Ilaiyaraaja wanted Vanna Nilavan to write the lyrics for \\"Uravugal Thodarkathai\\", but since Vanna Nilavan had difficulties in writing the lyrics, he opted out. He was subsequently replaced with Gangai Amaran. The song was reused in the film Megha (2014). It poignantly captures the vulnerable moments in the life of a woman, while \\"Panneer Pushpangale\\" and \\"Vaazhkai Odam Chella\\" have a \\"philosophical touch.\\" According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, author of the article The 1970s Tamil cinema and the post-classical turn, the songs were used \\"to punctuate the interiority of the characters rather than as a spectacle or as a device to move the plot forward.\\" In June 2013, A. Muthusamy of Honey Bee Music enhanced the songs from their original version on the film's soundtrack album to 5.1 surround sound.  Release  Aval Appadithan was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. It was released in only two theatres in Madras: Kamadhenu, and either Emerald or Blue Diamond in the Safire Theatre complex.  Reception  = Critical response = The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine Ananda Vikatan criticised the gaps in the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters. Retrospective response to the film has also been positive. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, \\"It was what we would call parallel cinema these days.\\" Writing for The Hindu, Baradwaj Rangan commented and remarked on how \\"different\\" the film was by saying: \\"Aval Appadithan was different. The shadowy black-and-white cinematography was different. The dialogues, which were more about revealing character than advancing plot, were different. The frank handling of sex and profanity ('she is a self-pitying, sex-starved bitch!') was different. The documentary-like detours were different. The painfully sensitive, feminist hero was different. Rudraiah was different.\\" D. Karthikeyan of The Hindu wrote in December 2009 that Aval Appadithan would \\"remain etched in every film lover's memory by showing the best of Rajnikanth's acting skills.\\" Director Mrinal Sen remarked, \\"The film was far ahead of its times.\\" Critics also appreciated the live-recording method of shooting the sequences where Haasan's character, Arun, interviewed women for his documentary. = Box office = The film did not initially receive a big response from the public, and was not a box office success upon its release. However, after the directors Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen wrote positive comments on it, people began to watch the film and appreciate it, leading Aval Appadithan to develop a cult following. In November 2014, Haasan defended the financial failure of the film, \\"Aval Appadithan was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. It slipped through their fingers, so to speak. With all the attention that films get these days, I doubt we can get away with such a film any more.\\"  Accolades  The film was awarded the Second Prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. At the same ceremony, Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the award for Best Cinematographer, and Sripriya received a Special Award for Best Actress of the year.  Legacy  Aval Appadithan is one of only two films ever directed by Rudhraiya; the other was Gramathu Athiyayam (1980). Aval Appadithan was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that Aval Appadithan help her face life in the real world. In a July 2004 interview with T. Saravanan of The Hindu, director Karu Pazhaniappan rated Aval Appadithan as one of the best films he had ever seen. In May 2007, K. Balamurugan of Rediff included Aval Appadithan in his list of \\"Rajni's Tamil Top 10\\". In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; two of them ‚Äì Balu Mahendra and Ameer ‚Äì named Aval Appadithan. Thiagarajan Kumararaja named Aval Appadithan as an inspiration for his film Aaranya Kaandam (2011). S. Shiva Kumar of The Hindu included the film on his December 2010 list of \\"Electrifying Rajinikanth-Kamal Haasan films\\" with Moondru Mudichu (1976), Avargal (1977) and 16 Vayathinile (1977). In April 2013, CNN- News18 included the film in its list, \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\". As of July 2013, Sruti Harihara Subramanian, founder and trustee of The Cinema Resource Centre (TCRC), has preserved many promotional stills and photographs of the film's production. In November 2013, The New Indian Express included the film in its list, \\"Kamal Haasan's most underrated films\\". In February 2014, CNN-News18 included Aval Appadithan in its list, titled \\"12 Indian films that would make great books\\". In Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam (2014), the hero's writing team discusses the theme of Aval Appadithan to get ideas for their film's story, until they realise that the film was a failure at the time of its release. Indo-Asian News Service, in their review of Sripriya's directorial venture Malini 22 Palayamkottai (2014), a film about a rape victim, stated, \\"Sripriya, who was once a successful actress, played a rape victim in Tamil drama Aval Appadithan. It's probably because of that role and the effect it had left on her, she handles this subject with great care and understanding that most of her peers would lack.\\" In January 2015, Somasundareshwar said, \\"I was told that if Aval Appadithan were made today, it would be a blockbuster. I don‚Äôt agree, for it‚Äôs still taboo for a woman to talk about her sexual encounters. The profile of the audience should change.\\" In July 2016, The Hindu included Aval Appadithan in its list of \\"roles that defined Rajinikanth the actor\\".

History Maerl has been extracted for centuries mainly for use as an agricultural fertilizer. The amount extracted increased in the late 20th century and in 2000, maerl was extracted at c. 5,000 tonnes per year in Ireland and c. 500,000 tonnes per year in France. Large scale maerl extraction over the past 40 years has removed and degraded maerl beds. In Cornwall, England, maerl has been extracted since the 1970s, but was banned in 2005 by Falmouth Harbour Commissioners. An early reference to maerl was made by John Ray in 1690 who reported it from Falmouth. In Ireland, maerl is extracted from subfossil beds in Bantry Bay by Celtic Sea Minerals.Celtic Sea Minerals website The maerl-forming species Lithothamion corallioides and Phymatolithon calcareum are listed in Annex V of the EC Habitats Directive.Forest Trends Uses Used as a soil conditioner, it is dredged from the sea floor and crushed to a powder.Thomas, D. 2002.

P. Muthuraman and produced by Kavithalayaa Productions. The film features Rajinikanth in double role as father and son with Saritha and Menaka in lead roles while Goundamani, Lakshmi and Sarath Babu play supporting roles. The soundtrack and score were composed by Ilayaraja while the lyrics for the tracks were written by Kannadasan. The film's story and dialogues was written by Visu and the screenplay was written by K. Balachander. Babu and R. Vittal handled cinematography and editing respectively. In the movie, the son wants his father to repent for the latter's mistake even if he respects his father very much. The film revolves around Chakravarthy, middle-aged businessman who is a womaniser. In the process, he rapes a girl Radha. Rest of the film revolves around Chakravarthy's son and Radha teaching an lesson to his father to mend his ways. The film was released on 15 August 1981 became successful at the box office. The film received critical acclaim with Rajinikanth's performance as a middle-aged womaniser being widely praised. The movie title ‚ÄúNetrikkan\\" is believed to be inspired from the popular conversation between Sangam age poet Nakkeerar and Lord Shiva in Thiruvilayadal movie. The poet questions Lord Shiva, who is in the disguise of another poet, about the quality of the poem written by the Lord himself. Angered by Nakeerar's question, the Lord reveals himself by opening His Third eye. Still poet Nakkerar is fearless, replying, ‚ÄúNetrikkan thirappinum kuttram kuttrame‚Äù which means 'A mistake is a mistake even if u are God (One who has the Third Eye)'. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Musalodiki Dasara Pandaga. The film was also remade in Telugu as Ahankari with Rajasekhar and was unofficially remade in Hindi as Rangeela Raja starring Govinda.  Plot  The story revolves around Chakravarthy (Older Rajini) who is a successful textile businessman in Coimbatore. He is a big womaniser (perhaps his only weakness) and picks up any women he wants. Other characters being wife Meenakshi (Lakshmi), his son Santosh (also Rajini) and his daughter Sangeetha (Vijayashanthi). It doesn't take long for Santosh to find his father's provocative behaviour and tries to mend his father's ways. Radha (Saritha) gets introduced as a candidate for PRO (Public Relations Officer) interview and eventually gets selected and is sent to Hong Kong for training. Chakravarthy unable to tolerate his son's growing menace also sets off to Hong Kong for a holiday. Here he meets Radha and at one point ends up raping her. Chakravarthy flies back to India where he is met with a number of changes which all points out to the new General Manager. This person turns out be Radha who has joined with Santosh to teach Chakravarthy a lesson for lifetime. How the duo succeed in changing Chakravarthy's behaviour forms the crux of the story.

Rajinikanth refused to act in the film as he was unimpressed with the Telugu film and character but later relented after Saravanan requested him to act. Saravanan called Visu who, after watching the film, said it could be remade well with minor changes and further developed Radhika's character. The film was colourised using Eastmancolor. It was Muthuraman's final film as actor and he portrayed a negative role. The crew brought in a dubbing artist to imitate his voice.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by M. S.

The term forwarding, used for mail since long before electronic communications, has no specific technical meaning,In section 3.9.2 List of RFC 5321, the term forwarding is used ambiguously. It notes that \\"the key difference between handling aliases (Section 3.9.1) and forwarding (this subsection) is the change to the [Return-Path header].\\" That wording, new w.r.t. RFC 2821, could be interpreted as the definition of forwarding, if the same term weren't used at the beginning of the same subsection with the opposite meaning. As a contributor to RFC 5321 agreed, but it implies that the email has been moved \\"forward\\" to a new destination. Email forwarding can also redirect mail going to a certain address and send it to one or more other addresses. Vice versa, email items going to several different addresses can converge via forwarding to end up in a single address in-box. Email users and administrators of email systems use the same term when speaking of both server-based and client-based forwarding.  Server-based forwarding  The domain name (the part appearing to the right of @ in an email address) defines the target server(s) The primary MX record of the relevant domain usually publishes the name of the mail server. Otherwise the domain name must have an IP address. for the corresponding class of addresses. A domain may also define backup servers; they have no mailboxes and forward messages without changing any part of their envelopes.The envelope of a message is the data transmitted in an SMTP transaction before transmitting the content of the message. The envelope is lost when the message is delivered, although some of its fields may be saved by the receiving server in the message's headers. In particular, the envelope holds the Return-Path (a.k.a. bounce address, MAIL FROM argument, mailfrom, or mfrom) and one or more recipients (including Bcc's). By contrast, primary servers can deliver a message to a user's mailbox and/or forward it by changing some envelope addresses. ~/.forward files (see below) provide a typical example of server-based forwarding to different recipients. Email administrators sometimes use the term redirection as a synonym for server-based email-forwarding to different recipients. Protocol engineers sometimes use the term Mediator to refer to a forwarding server. Because of spam, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reliably forward mail across different domains, and some recommend avoiding it if at all possible. = Uses of server-based forwarding to different recipients = ; Role-addresses: info, sales, postmaster, and similar namesRFC 2142, \\"Mailbox Names for Common Services, Roles and Functions\\", 1997, mentions also marketing, support, abuse, security, webmaster, and more. can appear to the left of @ in email addresses. An organization may forward messages intended for a given role to the address of the person(s) currently functioning in that role or office. ; Pseudonym-addresses: Most domain name hosting facilities provide facilities to forward mail to another email address such as a mailbox at the user's Internet Service Provider; there are also separate providers of mail forwarding services. This allows users to have an email address that does not change if they change mailbox provider. ; Multiple, or discontinued addresses: When users change their email address, or have several addresses, the user or an administrator may set up forwarding from these addresses, if still valid, to a single current one, in order to avoid losing messages. = Forwarding versus remailing = Plain message-forwarding changes the envelope recipient(s) and leaves the envelope sender field untouched. The \\"envelope sender\\" field does not equate to the From header which Email client software usually displays: it represents a field used in the early stages of the SMTP protocol, and subsequently saved as the Return-Path header. This field holds the address to which mail-systems must send bounce messages ‚Äî reporting delivery-failure (or success) ‚Äî if any. By contrast, the terms remailing or redistribution can sometimes mean re-sending the message and also rewriting the \\"envelope sender\\" field. Electronic mailing lists furnish a typical example. Authors submit messages to a reflector that performs remailing to each list address. That way, bounce messages (which report a failure delivering a message to any list- subscriber) will not reach the author of a message. However, annoying misconfigured vacation autoreplies do reach authors. Typically, plain message-forwarding does alias-expansion, while proper message-forwarding, also named forwarding tout-court serves for mailing-lists. When additional modifications to the message are carried out, so as to rather resemble the action of a Mail User Agent submitting a new message, the term forwarding becomes deceptive and remailing seems more appropriate. In the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), the domain-name in the envelope sender remains subject to policy restrictions. Therefore, SPF generally disallows plain message-forwarding. Intra domain redirection complies with SPF as long as the relevant servers share a consistent configuration. Mail servers that practise inter-domain message-forwarding may break SPF even if they do not implement SPF themselves, i.e. they neither apply SPF checks nor publish SPF records. Consider the following forward path: :\\\\mathit{A -> B -> C} Domain B must not plainly forward a message from domain A to domain C, unless it controls either the policy of A or the filtering of C. Indeed, if A publishes an SPF policy that prevents B from using A's name, and C applies sender's policy-checking, C may refuse the message according to RFC 7208. In other words, one cannot formally distinguish plain message- forwarding from illegal domain-name abuse. Sender Rewriting Scheme provides for a generic forwarding mechanism compatible with SPF.  Client-based forwarding  = Automated client-based forwarding = Client forwarding can take place automatically using a non-interactive client such as a mail retrieval agent. Although the retrieval agent uses a client protocol, this forwarding resembles server forwarding in that it keeps the same message- identity. Concerns about the envelope-sender apply. = Manual client-based forwarding = An end-user can manually forward a message using an email client. Forwarding inline quotes the message below the main text of the new message, and usually preserves original attachments as well as a choice of selected headers (e.g. the original From and Reply-To.) The recipient of a message forwarded this way may still be able to reply to the original message; the ability to do so depends on the presence of original headers and may imply manually copying and pasting the relevant destination addresses. Forwarding as attachment prepares a MIME attachment (of type message/rfc822) that contains the full original message, including all headers and any attachment. Note that including all the headers discloses much information about the message, such as the servers that transmitted it and any client-tag added on the mailbox. The recipient of a message forwarded this way may be able to open the attached message and reply to it seamlessly. This kind of forwarding actually constitutes a remailing from the points of view of the envelope-sender and of the recipient(s). The message identity also changes.  Historical development of email forwarding  RFC 821, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, by Jonathan B. Postel in 1982, provided for a forward-path for each recipient, in the form of, for example, \`@USC-ISIE.ARPA, @USC-ISIF.ARPA: Q-Smith@ISI-VAXA.ARPA\` ‚Äî an optional list of hosts and a required destination-mailbox. When the list of hosts existed, it served as a source-route, indicating that each host had to relay the mail to the next host on the list. Otherwise, in the case of insufficient destination-information but where the server knew the correct destination, it could take the responsibility to deliver the message by responding as follows: S: RCPT TO: R: 251 User not local; will forward to The concept at that time envisaged the elements of the forward-path (source route) moving to the return-path (envelope sender) as a message got relayed from one SMTP server to another. Even if the system discouraged the use of source-routing, See the note in section 6.2.7 Explicit path specification of RFC 822 dynamically building the return-path implied that the \\"envelope sender\\" information could not remain in its original form during forwarding. Thus RFC 821 did not originally allow plain message-forwarding. The introduction of the MX recordMX record has been introduced with RFC 974. See the historical section in MX record#History of fallback to A. made source- routing unnecessary. In 1989, RFC 1123 recommended accepting source-routing only for backward-compatibility. At that point, plain message forwarding became the recommended action for alias-expansion. In 2008, RFC 5321 still mentions that \\"systems may remove the return path and rebuild [it] as needed\\", taking into consideration that not doing so might inadvertently disclose sensitive information. Plain message forwarding may disclose the final destination-address irrespectively of the user's intention. See sections 7.7 Information Disclosure in Message Forwarding, and 4.4 Trace Information in RFC 5321. Actually, plain message-forwarding can be conveniently used for alias expansion within the same server or a set of coordinated servers. = \`~/.forward\` files = The reference SMTP implementation in the early 1980s was sendmail, which provided for \`~/.forward\` files, which can store the target email-addresses for given users. This kind of server-based forwarding is sometimes called dot-forwarding. One can configure some email-program filters to automatically perform forwarding or replying actions immediately after receiving. Forward files can also contain shell scripts, which have become a source of many security problems. Formerly only trusted users could utilize the command-line switch for setting the envelope sender, \`-f arg\`; some systems disabled this feature for security reasons. The (version 8.708 of 2006) sendmail documentation mentions no restrictions in using the \`-f\` switch, and uses the verb set rather than override to describe its action on the envelope sender data. Email predates the formalization of client‚Äìserver architectures in the 1990s.The book dates in client-server-faq range from the early 1990s. Although remote procedure calls originated in the 1970s, they did not become widely used until networks became quite common. Therefore, the distinction between client and server seems necessarily forced. The original distinction contrasted daemons and user-controlled programs which run on the same machine.

It is common in most of its range, but largely absent from the arid northwest and the eastern lowlands of South Africa. It is found in open habitats such as grassland, karoo scrub, thornbush and agricultural land, and often associates with farm animals. Description thumb The adult of this long starling has mainly dully glossed black plumage except for a white lower belly and undertail. It has a white iris and yellow lower mandible. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile has unglossed plumage, a brown iris and a dull yellow lower mandible. There are no subspecies. This species has a number of calls, but the most familiar is a skeer kerrra kerrra. There is also a soft warbling song. Behaviour =Breeding= The pied starling usually nests in tunnels in river banks, but will use holes in buildings, straw bales or natural tree holes. There is a record of a nest being constructed in a wrecked ship from the shore. The nest is lined with a wide variety of plant material and items of human waste such as paper and rope. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of two to six are known. The eggs are blue-green, immaculate or with some red spots. The female alone incubates for , and the chicks fledge in another . Both parents feed the chicks, assisted by helpers, which are typically subadult or unmated birds. This cooperative breeding is reinforced by mutual allofeeding between adults, behaviour reinforced by the bright gape, a feature normally lost in adults of most bird species. This starling is commonly double-brooded. It may be parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo and greater honeyguide. =Roosting= The pied starling is gregarious and when not breeding will form large flocks, sometimes numbering more than . Its roosts may be shared by lesser kestrels or wattled starlings. It will feed with European starlings, but they rarely roost together. =Feeding= Like other starlings, the pied starling is an omnivore, taking a wide range of invertebrates, seeds and berries, but its diet is mainly insects, including many ants and termites. It will take figs from gardens and some human food discards. Foraging is frequently near livestock, with birds feeding on insects disturbed by the animals and also perching on cattle or sheep to remove ectoparasites. The pied starling has sometimes been seen as a pest when it takes soft fruit such as grapes or figs, and was also itself considered good eating. However, it is little persecuted at present. Status This species has a large range, estimated at . The population size has not been quantified, but it is believed to be large as the species is described as 'common' in at least parts of its range. It is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

The film stars Rajinikanth, Madhavi and Sulakshana. It revolves around a spoilt rich man who is forced to live in a village for one year to learn discipline. The film was released on 20 April 1984. It was later remade in Kannada as Anjada Gandu (1988).  Plot  Balu is a lavish spendthrift with a cavalier attitude towards life. Born to a rich father Chandrasekhar, he has a rampant and aggressive behaviour and gets into confrontations wherever he perceives injustice. Worried about Balu's behaviour, Chandrasekhar decides to send him to his friend and ex-militaryman Gangadharan's village ‚Äì Uthama Palayam, to work for him for one year with a condition that Balu will not reveal that he is the son of Chandrasekhar. Balu slowly gets accustomed to the village life and learns to work hard and develops a good relation with Gangadharan and his family. During his stay, he spars with an arrogant rich girl, Sumathi. Assuming Balu to be a poor villager, she tries to humiliate him and Balu responds in kind. Eventually they both fall in love. In a triangular story line, Gangadharan's daughter also falls in love with Balu, but learns he is in love with Sumathi. A dejected Sulakshana agrees to marry a man chosen by her father. Sumathi's father, who had agreed to get her married to his partner's son, rescinds the proposal on Madhavi's request. This enrages the villainous partner and he kidnaps Sumathi to marry her by force to his son. Balu rescues her and leaves her in the custody of Gangadharan's daughter and her suitor. However, the suitor betrays his trust and turns her over back to the partner and his son. In a final fight sequence, Balu rescues Sumathi and returns her to her father. Balu then leaves the village after learning hard work, discipline and many other good virtues from Gangadharan. The final scene shows Sumathi and her father at Balu's father house discussing marriage for Sumathi.

Mahendran. The film stars Rajinikanth, Sridevi and Deepa. Featuring Rajinikanth in a dual role, it revolves around the eponymous con artist who is implicated for a crime committed by Vidyasagar, a lookalike barber. Johnny was released on 15 August 1980. Though the film disappointed audiences in the first two weeks of its run because its title gave the impression of an action entertainer, it picked up in the third week and became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres.  Plot  Johnny is a con artist who indulges in petty thefts with his friend, mainly to settle his father's debts. Johnny was born out of wedlock; his mother never got the recognition and dignity of a wife. His father becomes bankrupt, and though Johnny is upset on never getting recognised legally as a son, decides to help his father by clearing all his loans. Johnny, a diehard fan of singer Archana, never misses her concerts, which is also noticed by Archana. A romance develops between the two, but neither expresses it. Vidyasagar, a parsimonious barber, lives with his assortment of pet animals in a bungalow away from the city. Once when he returns home after getting drunk and losing control, he is helped by Bhama, a homeless orphan. When Bhama requests him to employ her for domestic work, he relents. Bhama, slightly greedy and indecisive, always aspires for better things in life. However, her beauty and innocence makes Vidyasagar fall in love with her. He protects and cares for her and buys her new clothes. Johnny cons a businessman, who files a police complaint. When he sees Vidyasagar at the salon, he mistakes him for Johnny and calls the police. The Commissioner investigates the case along with the Superintendent. Since Vidyasagar was in the barbershop when the theft took place, the Commissioner believes the thief is someone else. The police start hunting for Johnny and also monitor Vidyasagar. Johnny's friend visits the salon and mistakes Vidyasagar for Johnny. Upon realising Vidyasagar is another man, he brings Johnny to meet him. Johnny is surprised on seeing Vidyasagar. Learning of the troubles Vidyasagar is facing because of his crimes, Johnny visits Vidyasagar and reveals himself as the real culprit. To prevent Vidyasagar from getting into issues with the police, Johnny tells him to remain home for 10 days so that he can resolve all the issues and come clean. Archana expresses her love for Johnny, but he hesitates to reciprocate due to his background. When Archana misunderstands his hesitation, thinking he is doubting her integrity and character, Johnny confesses his love and seeks time to settle a few things before marrying her. With the ill-earned money, Johnny settles all the loans and goes to meet his father, but is shocked when his father collapses after knowing his son settled his loans. Vidyasagar notices Bhama with a rich man. When questioned, she says she shares a sibling-like relationship with him. Not wasting time, Vidyasagar proposes to her and assures he will take good care of her. However, Bhama looks down at his profession and feels it would be embarrassing for her children to be called a barber's children. Though hurt, Vidyasagar tries to explain things to her and also gives her time to decide. However, Bhama hurriedly tries to escape with the rich man at night. Vidyasagar stops and kills them both. The passersby notice this and call the police, who assume it to be the work of Johnny and go searching for him, for this case and also for other pending cases against him. Johnny, already a fugitive, continues to hide from the police. He meets a tribal girl who gives him shelter in her colony. She falls for him but Johnny refuses and escapes into the nearby forest when the police come looking for him. Having killed Bhama and her lover, Vidyasagar also goes underground. Knowing well that his lookalike Johnny is wanted, he tries to foist the murder charge on him. When Vidyasagar learns from Johnny's friend about Archana's love and her affluence, he decides to impersonate Johnny and goes to meet Archana at her house. On reaching there, he learns that she has shifted residence and he goes there (a modest house). When Archana explains that she compensated Johnny's victims by using up all her wealth, Vidyasagar gets disappointed to learn that she is no longer rich. Archana, hurt by \\"Johnny's\\" curtness, gets confused about his change in taste and behaviour. Though Vidyasagar had come with plans to win her and grab her wealth, her good character and love for Johnny stop him, and he finally confesses that he is not Johnny. He assures her that Johnny will be back soon and advises her to perform one last concert (which she had cancelled after Johnny got into trouble with police) so that Johnny will return. Archana organises her last concert with much publicity. Johnny sees the advertisement and decides to attend the concert. On the scheduled day, heavy rains lash the city and a cyclone is forecast. No-one dares to come out of their homes. However, Archana insists and comes to the venue and sings. The police, knowing her closeness to Johnny, suspect something fishy in her decision and wait at the venue. Finally, Johnny arrives at the venue and is nabbed by the police. But he reveals to Archana that he is actually Vidyasagar posing as Johnny. Vidyasagar, claiming to be Johnny, accepts responsibility for all the frauds and murders and accompanies the police after declaring to Archana that Johnny is now free to live with her and wishes them well. Archana gets upset when the real Johnny does not turn up and leaves the venue. Just before she leaves, Johnny finally reaches, meets her and understands all that transpired. The lovers unite.  Cast  * Rajinikanth as Johnny and Vidyasagar * Sridevi as Archana * Deepa as Bhama * Balaji as a police officer * Suruli Rajan as Johnny's friend * Samikannu as Naidu * Prabhakar Reddy as Johnny's father * Gopalakrishnan as a police officer * Subhashini as a tribal woman * Kanchana as Johnny's mother  Production  Mahendran had a strong desire to make a film with Rajinikanth at that time, hence he made this film simultaneously with Nenjathai Killathe. As the producer could not provide the equipment and facilities for the climax scene with a song, Mahendran was forced to use stock shots and manage to shoot with the limited facilities offered, but managed to mix the close-up shots with stock shot, and the scene came properly. This was the first time for which popular artist Jayaraj designed the costumes. He first drew the illustrations of scenes with costumes and then got them stitched, bringing in newness and style in Rajinikanth's look, which attracted the masses. The scene where Archana proposes to Johnny was shot in Ooty in a bungalow at midnight. When the scene was shot, the whole unit was silent, they saw only the characters of the film, not Rajinikanth and Sridevi. After the scene was shot, Rajinikanth appreciated Sridevi's acting and mentioned to Mahendran that though he tried, she overshadowed him in the scene. Because Rajinikanth played two roles, he was billed twice in the opening credits, as \\"Rajinikanth and Rajinikanth\\". To play Vidyasagar, Rajinikanth sported a centre-parted hairstyle and wore box-framed glasses.  Themes  Kavitha Muralidharan of The Hindu wrote that most of Mahendran's films, including Johnny, \\"offer a prismatic view of relationships\\". She contrasted Johnny with Mahendran's earlier film Uthiripookkal (1979), saying that while that film's protagonist was \\"rigid in his relationship with people\\", the title character of Johnny is \\"as vulnerable as a woman could be\\". Mani Prabhu of Cinema Express described Johnny as an antithesis to the \\"lead man of those times ‚Äì the macho guy, surrounded by drooling girls, bashing up villains and spouting pretentious advice\\" by being \\"vulnerable, loving and grounded\\".  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The song \\"Oru Iniya Manathu\\" is erroneously credited to Jency on the original LP record marketed by Inreco, but actually sung by Sujatha. The song \\"Aasaiye Kaathule\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Sindhu Bhairavi, and \\"Kaatril Enthan\\" is set in Keeravani. \\"Aasaiye Kaathule\\" was reused twice in Telugu as \\"Naa Sari Sogasari\\" in Chakravyuham (1993) and as \\"Raathri\\" in Gundello Godari (2013). It was also reused as \\"Sannata\\" in the Hindi film Shamitabh (2015).

Release and reception  Johnny was released on 15 August 1980. Piousji of the magazine Sunday wrote, \\"Sridevi not only looked smart, but came out with a convincing performance and [Rajinikanth] too was quite impressive\\" in Johnny. Ananda Vikatan gave the film a C+ rating. The title Johnny gave the impression of an action entertainer, hence it disappointed audiences in the first two weeks. However, the emotionally moving story, intense acting by Rajinikanth and Sridevi and songs attracted the audience, so the film picked up in the third week and became a success, running for over 100 days in theatres.

Ravi, and directed by Muktha Srinivasan who also wrote the screenplay. A remake of the 1976 Kannada film Premada Kanike, it stars Rajinikanth, Lakshmi and Sripriya. The film revolves around a wealthy merchant who murders a would- be rapist, then keeps his daughter's nanny, who was both the intended victim and a witness, captive in his house. The film was shot mainly in Bangalore, with additional shooting taking place in Chennai, Shimla and Kashmir. It was released on 6 November 1980, Diwali, and became a commercial success.  Plot  Seetha, a young woman, is travelling via train with her nephew Raju to an estate to attend her job interview as a nanny to the estate merchant Manohar's daughter. Her co-passenger tries to rape her but suddenly he is shot dead. Seetha sees the murderer and clearly remembers his face and reports the murder to Moorthy, a police inspector. Then she is appointed for the nanny position and she and Manohar's daughter Shoba grow fond of each other. Manohar, who is extremely fond of his daughter returns from his journey. Seetha meets him, only to realise that he is the murderer she saw on the train. Manohar threatens Seetha not to tell anyone and makes sure to prevent her from leaving his estate as she is keen on reporting him to the police. Seetha tries many times to escape but is always caught. She does not even tell the police when she meets them as Manohar threatens to kill Raju if she did.

Manohar also reveals that the man he killed on the train was Chandru. Seetha now understands his acts and vows not to tell anyone. Moorthy's colleague is curious about Seetha; she said that she remembered the face and was eager to find the murderer, but now she had told him she has forgotten the face, hence he suspects Seetha to be the murderer, and Moorthy agrees with his belief. On Shoba's birthday, Manohar is to announce that he is to hand over all his wealth to Seetha and surrender to the police, but before this the police arrive and try to arrest Seetha. Manohar saves her by confessing to the murder, leading to his arrest. A few years later, Manohar is released from jail and reunites with Seetha and Shoba.

Playing career McGhee began his career in his native Ayrshire with Cronberry in 1878 and then Boswell Thistle two years later before moving to Edinburgh side Hibernian in 1883. Hibernian had been founded for the benefit of Edinburgh's immigrant Irish Catholic population but the club quickly became a beacon for the Irish-Catholic minority throughout Scotland. They were able to attract players from Irish communities across the country and with this abundant supply of talent they rapidly became one of the dominant sides in Scotland. McGhee was one such player and, as a free-scoring inside forward, he developed into a key part of the side. He is still Hibs record goalscorer against Hearts with at least 24 goals. He scored a remarkable 5 goals in the first 25 minutes in the Rosebery Charity Cup final of 1887, Hibs winning 7‚Äì1. In 1887, McGhee captained Hibs to victory in the Scottish Cup, the first time a side from the east of Scotland had won the tournament. A year earlier, alongside teammate, James Lundie, he had become the first Hibs player to be capped by the Scottish national side.Memorabilia mixes with poignant tales in new Easter Road exhibit, The Scotsman, 31 May 2008 Hibs suffered a rapid decline when the foundation of Celtic in 1888 usurped their position as the standard-bearers of the Irish community. After a brief period with St Bernard's, McGhee followed the example of many of his former Hibs team-mates by moving to Celtic. He later ended his playing career with short spells with Dykebar and Abercorn. Hearts manager In 1908, McGhee was hired as manager of Hibernian's city rivals Hearts, the third person to hold the role at the Tynecastle club. His appointment was not popular with the Hearts' support because he had been a prolific scorer against their side in his playing days with Hibs. He had also been at the centre of an incident that resulted in crowd disturbance in a Rosebery Cup match between the sides in 1886, when his tackle broke the leg of Hearts opponent Peter Bell. McGhee left Hearts in December 1909 after he had suspended the club's star player Bobby Walker due to a breach in team discipline (missing a game). When Walker was reinstated by the board, McGhee and his assistant David Smart resigned. Later life McGhee emigrated to the United States of America in 1910, where he settled in Philadelphia, sending for his family two years later. His son Bart would later play football for the United States as an Outside Left, earning selection in their squad for the 1930 World Cup and scoring their first goal at the finals. McGhee died on 30 July 1941 in Philadelphia, PA. He is buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery with his wife, Ellen.

It is situated in Melaghar, 53 kilometers away from Agartala, the capital of Tripura. The palace is situated in the middle of Rudrasagar Lake and assimilates Hindu architectural style  History  The construction was started in 1930 and completed in 1938.  Architecture  The palace is the largest of its kind in India and the only one in Eastern India. It is so huge, it cannot be fit into a single picture frame on the standard camera until you are at a distance of approximately 800 metres from the entrance. There are only two water palaces in India, the other one being the Jal Mahal in Rajasthan. However, the latter is significantly smaller in size than Neermahal. Known as the ‚Äòlake palace‚Äô of Tripura, Neer-Mahal was constructed as a summer residence. It was Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarma's idea to build a palace amidst the splendid Rudrasagar lake and in 1921 he accredited the British company Martin and Burns to construct the palace for him. The company took nine years to complete the palace. Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarma belonged to the ‚ÄòManikya Dynasty‚Äô which is supposed to be the second longest remaining dynasty in the world today. The palace is the establishment of the Maharaja‚Äôs great taste and his fascinating idea of blending Medieval Hindu and Muslim traditions and cultures. The palace is divided into two parts. The western side of the palace is known as Andar Mahal. It was made for the royal family. The eastern side is an open-air theatre where drama, theatre, dance and other cultural events were organized for the enjoyment of Maharajas and their royal families. The palace has 24 rooms in total. Neer-Mahal has two stairways inside leading down to a landing on the water of Rudrasagar Lake. Maharajas used to go to the palace by hand powered boat from ‚ÄòRajghat‚Äô. On the ceiling, the palace houses one of the most beautiful terrace gardens of India, though poor maintenance and lack of exposure to tourists has led to the depletion of beauty and splendor.

The servers for the game shut down in May 2011. Gameplay Football Manager Live differed significantly from previous Football Manager titles, whilst keeping the same match engine and many of their fundamental concepts. Users were assigned to a \\"Game World\\" of up to 1000 players and created their club and filled their squad with real players, similar to fantasy football. Players were signed via a proxy bidding system similar to that of eBay with the player signing with the highest-bidding club.Football Manager Live: How the ultimate management sim became an MMORPG , The Guardian, 17 March 2008 Whilst Football Manager Live utilised a very similar database to that of Football Manager 2009, like its offline counterpart, ageing players retired and younger players were randomly generated in their place within each game world, creating an increasingly fictional environment as seasons progress. Clubs could choose a football association based on the number of matches the user wants to play (\\"Casual\\" FAs for casual players and \\"Xtreme\\" ones for more dedicated managers) and which play times were most convenient. Each FA had its own ladder system with a premier league and several lower leagues which were linked via promotion and relegation. Matchmaking for league fixtures was done through a \\"resolve by\\" system in which users have to finish a game by a certain deadline instead of having to meet online at a specific time. If a player could not meet the deadline, an AI \\"assistant manager\\" took over their team for that match. The game also added a role playing game-like skill training system for users. Managers could improve their skills over time in coaching, physiotherapy, finance, scouting and infrastructure to become more specialised or to suit their style of play. In order to manage the inflationary economics of the game, players were required to construct a stadium to accommodate several different fan bases to the club. These included die hards, devoted, families, glory hunters and corporates, each offering their own characteristics such as wealth and atmosphere. This took money out of club finances and was generally received negatively by players. The stadia and fan base profile had little impact on gameplay and had no impact on the appearance of stadia during gameplay.  Gameworlds  There were 12 Gameworlds in Football Manager Live. The gameworld system was radically changed in 2010 when they were split into two types: 'Fantasy Players' and 'Returning Stars.' Previously, as a gameworld progressed over time, 'real life' players gradually aged and retired to be replaced by generated players (or 'regens'). This remains the case with 'Fantasy Players' gameworlds, but for 'Returning Stars' the gameworld is reset sporadically back to the present day. The first gameworld, launched on 4 November 2008 was Cantona, and this was followed by 8 other worlds until the first Pro-Gameworld, Toms, was launched on 12 January 2009. Existing users were encouraged to join the first Pro-Gameworld by having the opportunity to transfer the skills that they had gained to the new Gameworld. This had not been possible when transferring worlds previously and the challenge of playing the best was readily taken up. Gameworlds were named after real-life ex- players. In June 2010 the 3D match engine, first seen in Football Manager 2009 was added to Football Manager Live. Game restructuring On 26 November 2009, vast changes to the existing game were announced by SI. The most controversial of these changes was the announcement of the resetting of all current game worlds to their initial states, which would commence on 1 March 2010 This announcement caused controversy amongst the community as many managers were upset by the results from this decision which would include losing all progress made up until this date. SI in an attempt to make up for this action offered all current subscribers two months of free play time though this was met with relatively negative reactions. On 18 December 2009 Sports Interactive announced that it would be extending the free time for its managers until the reset in March 2010. It was also announced following the outcry over lost skills that they would be implementing a new skills system into FML after the reset which would allow current managers to use their existing skill points after the reset. This move was met with great appreciation by the game's current subscribers. At the same time it was announced that the new version 1.4 would include youth academies and many more extras which its subscribers had been asking for many months.

They are responsible for administration of the national men's, women's, and junior teams, the Australian National Water Polo League, and development of the sport in Australia. WPA broke away from the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia (now Swimming Australia) in 1982 to become the Australian Amateur Water Polo Association (AAWPA). Prior to that time, water polo was administered by a sub- committee of the ASUA. In January, 1990, the AAWPA changed its name to 'Water Polo Australia Incorporated'. The sport is now governed by a national conference of representatives from all states and territories, which elect five Directors to the WPAL Board. Water polo is one of a small number of truly national sports in Australia, with the game being played by both men and women across every state. WPA also ensures the senior men's and women's teams tour overseas at least once a year, and in addition holds national men's and women's competitions for 20 & Unders, 18 & Unders, 16 & Unders, and 14 & Unders.  State Associations  WPA also oversees all of the state governing bodies for each of the Australian states. These are: Water Polo ACT, Water Polo New South Wales, Water Polo Queensland, Water Polo Tasmania, Water Polo South Australia, Water Polo Victoria, and Water Polo Western Australia.  History  Behind Great Britain, Australia was the second nation in the world to play the game of water polo. The first known Australian match occurred at St. Kilda Baths, Melbourne on 3 March 1879 and was demonstrated by Professor Fred Cavill, who had only just emigrated from England.Bendigo Advertiser (3 March 1879, p.2) Australian men's teams have competed at every Olympic Games Water Polo Tournament since 1948, excepting 1968 (controversially not nominated by the AOC) and 1996 (did not qualify). Australia were the inaugural Olympic gold medallists at the first Women's Olympic Games Water Polo Tournament in Sydney (2000), and have since won two Olympic bronze medals at Beijing (2008) and London (2012).

In 1822, he was tasked with suppressing the Greek War of Independence, but was defeated at the Battle of Dervenakia and died shortly after. Early life and career Mahmud was raised and educated at the Topkapi Palace at Istanbul. He participated in various campaigns throughout the Empire, rising to the rank of vizier and acquiring significant military skills. Enjoying the patronage of the Valide Sultan, he was eventually posted in his family's home province of Drama, succeeding his father Melek Mehmed Pasha as governor. From this he got his sobriquet Dramali. In 1820 he was Pasha of Thessaly at Larissa and participated in the army of Hursid Pasha that was operating against the rebel Ali Pasha of Yannina.Finlay, pp. 95-99 In the summer of 1821, as the Greek War of Independence began, he crushed the first rebellions by Greeks in the city of Drama.Finlay, pp. 242-249 After the disgrace and suicide of Hursid, took over as Mora valesi, with the task of destroying the Greek revolt in its heart, the Morea. He assembled a well- equipped army of well over 20,000 men, a huge force by Balkan standards, and the largest Ottoman army to enter Greece since the Ottoman invasion of the Morea in 1715. These comprised among others ca. 8,000 cavalry, predominantly from Macedonia and Thrace, and several thousand veterans of the campaign against Ali Pasha.Finlay, p. 350 The Morea Campaign At the head of his army, Dramali set off from Larissa in late June 1822, and swept practically unmolested through eastern Greece: his forces marched unopposed through Boeotia, where they razed Thebes, and Attica, where however he did not attempt to retake the Acropolis, which had only shortly before surrendered to the Greeks. He passed through the defiles of the Megaris unmolested, and entered the Peloponnese. He arrived at Corinth in mid-July, and found the strong fort of Acrocorinth abandoned without a fight by its Greek garrison. He wed the widow of the fort's murdered former commander, Kiamil Bey, and was joined by Yusuf Pasha of Patras, who advised him to remain in Corinth, using it as a base, and to build up strong naval forces in the Corinthian Gulf and isolate the Morea, before advancing on Tripoli. But Dramali, by now utterly self- confident by the Greeks' apparent reluctance to oppose him, decided to march at once to the south, towards the Argolis. His advance caused a panic among the Greeks: the siege of Nafplio was abandoned just as the garrison was preparing to surrender, and the provisional government fled Argos and embarked on ships for safety. However, on arriving at Argos on 11 July, Dramali made two critical mistakes: he did not secure his main supply and retreat route through the Dervenakia Pass, and ignored the fact that the absence of the Ottoman Navy meant that he could not be supplied by sea. Instead, he focused on taking the town's fort, stubbornly defended by a 700-strong Greek garrison under Demetrios Ypsilantis, which held out for twelve vital days, before breaking through the besiegers' lines and escaping. During that time, the Greeks, under Theodoros Kolokotronis, rallied their forces, and occupied the surrounding hills and defiles, including the Dervenakia. The Greeks systematically looted the villages of the Argolic plain, even setting fire to the crops and damaging the springs, so as to starve the Turkish army. Trapped in the sweltering summer heat of the Argolic plain, without water and food, Dramali was forced to plan withdrawing back to Corinth. On 26 July he sent out his cavalry as an advance guard towards the Dervenakia pass. But the Greeks were expecting the move, and had taken up positions there. The resulting battle was a complete Greek victory, with few Ottomans managing to escape. Finally, two days later, Dramali set out with his main army. Although he and his bodyguard managed to pass, the majority of his army, as well as the treasury and most baggage and equipment, were trapped in the pass and massacred. The result of Dramali's campaign, which had started so well, was a complete disaster: out of more than 30,000 soldiers, only 6,000 returned to Corinth, where Dramali died of high fever. Dramali's defeat saved the Greek uprising from an early failure. The extent of the defeat was such that it entered into the modern Greek language as a proverb: \\"Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒøœÜŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîœÅŒ¨ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ∑\\" (Dramali's catastrophe), which is used to denote a complete disaster. His descendants live today in Egypt and Turkey.

The complex is situated along Jalan Duta (Duta Road) in Segambut, some away from the earlier location of the judicial system at a collection of colonial buildings affront the Merdeka Square. The building was constructed beginning 1 March 2004 at a final cost of RM290 million, was opened for use on 18 April 2007, and was fully operational on 3 May 2007.  Occupants and previous locations  The Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex houses the High Court, the Sessions Court and the Magistrates' Court of Kuala Lumpur. Night courts are also conducted to handle cases pertaining to traffic offences. The Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex was primarily planned to hold a larger number of relevant court cases at once, as well as centralise judicial branches in the city into one building. Prior to the complex's opening, courts in Kuala Lumpur were scattered among several former colonial municipal buildings affront the Merdeka Square (among them, the Sultan Abdul Samad Building), as well as Wisma Denmark, the embassy of Denmark cum office building in Dang Wangi that housed the Civil High Court. The fate of the buildings at the Merdeka Square were left to the Tourist Minister to determine.  Layout and amenities  The complex, which consists of a single large structure is planned in a U-shaped design with a left and right wing, and has a total of six above-ground levels, of which five from the bottom each contain a collection of numbered courtrooms. Courtrooms are situated at either wings of the building, while the registrars, registries and filling counters are located closer to the center of the building. In all, the complex contains 30 courtrooms for the High Courts, 21 for the Sessions Courts and 26 for the Magistrates' Courts. Administration offices and surau's for men and women are situated on the 6th floor, the top floor of the complex. The complex is touted as the second largest courthouse in the world, although it was claimed to be the largest in the world earlier. The complex is additionally intended to contain a library, a business centre, tunnel access to holding rooms for the accused, as well as televisions for four courtrooms to air court hearings. Closed-circuit television cameras and wireless Internet connectivity are also to be made available within the complex's vicinity. E-Court facilities that would enable court procedures to be done over the Internet were also planned. The building, which is sited on 12 ha of land, is surrounded by landscaping with rest areas and a mini park for the public. 500 parking bays for the public, 300 bays for court staff and 200 bays for judges and magistrates were also prepared in the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex. Parking has been a major woe for the public as they are allocated merely 500 parking spaces which has to be shared with lawyers. In solving this problem, numerous steps have been taken which includes allocating special designated area for lawyers to park their vehicles, all mentions before the Sessions Court or Magistrate Judges are rescheduled to be heard in the afternoon at 2.00 p.m. (MST) (on Friday, 2:45 p.m.) and also implementing shuttle service to the new court complex .  Architecture  The architecture of the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex was meant to bear similarities to architectures of colonial municipal buildings, evoking hints of neoclassical architecture, Palladian architecture, as well as Mughal and Westernised styling exemplified by the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. In addition to its symmetrical U-shaped floor plan, the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex features a central portico that rises above the rest of the building, and features a large onion dome surrounded by four semi-spherical domes; each of the building's left and right wings has an additional set of three porticos and four semi-spherical domes. The building is adorned with colonnades of varied diameters and height of two to five floors, with verandahs behind the front and rear facades of the building's two wings.  Technical difficulties  Within a month of opening, the courts complex experienced a series of faults and technical failures, raising questions of the building's reliability and the parties involved in the construction of the building. The problems were reported to have started even before occupancy, beginning April: * Cracks measuring at least 3m long were reported in early April. * On 30 April 2007, just over a week after occupancy, two (four feet by four feet) ceiling panels and a downlight collapsed in a Civil Courts room at 10.30 am. No injuries were reported. * Less than a week after the ceiling panel collapse, cracks measuring at least 3m long began appearing outside Magistrate's Court 4. The cracks were since patched up. * On 7 May 2007, the air conditioning in a High Court room malfunctioned. * On 23 May 2007, the cafeteria of the complex was flooded starting 9.15am as a result of a burst pipe endcap from a service room. The flowing water affected three-quarters of the cafeteria, and reached a depth of 7 cm. Water supply was cut 15‚Äì25 minutes later, and three hours of cleaning work was needed for a return to normalcy. Public Works Department director-general Selvanayagam P. Nagalingam attributed the fault to a plumber, who he claims had defaulted on following design specifications, but added that only two sub-standard endcaps were found. On the same day, a sewage manhole overflowed in the basement of the complex, damaging a number of files for mostly civil cases. Nagalingam was reported to have state the manhole overflow was the result of indiscriminate disposal of sanitary napkins that could have occurred for some time. The blockage was stated to be immediately cleared after Nagalingam learned of the incident at 9.28am that day.

Biography At the age of fifteen he joined the Canons Regular of Saint-Cheron, and was sent to the College of Navarre in Paris, where he received the degree of Doctor of Theology (1555). On account of the erudition of his early works and the aptitude which he showed for controversy, he was called to the Conference of Poissy, held in 1561 between the Catholics and the Huguenots, at which Theodore of Beza and Diego Lainez, Superior General of the Society of Jesus, were present. He was afterwards deputed to the Council of Trent to represent, with Simon Vigor, the University of Paris. Upon his return he acquired a reputation by his sermons and his discussions with Protestants. He published a work against their spoliation of Catholic churches and a vigorous declaration against the doctrines of John Calvin and Theodore of Beza; the latter replied and drew upon himself a new attack from Claude de Sainctes. At the same time he charged the King of France by his treatise on \\"L'ancien naturel des Fran√ßais\\" never to tolerate heretics and against these latter he defended the dogma of the Church by an exhaustive treatise on the Eucharist. Through the patronage of Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, he was appointed to the Bishopric of √âvreux(1575). He was very zealous in his efforts to convert Protestants. He assisted at the provincial Council of Rouen (1581) and published its records in French. When the League became active he took sides with it and worked to gain partisans, but the royal troops took possession of √âvreux and the bishop was forced to flee. Unfortunately for him there were found among his papers writings in which he approved the murder of Henry III of France, and maintained that one could likewise kill his successor. Arrested and arraigned before the Parlement of Caen, he was condemned to death as guilty of high treason.

(\\"Ethnic relations\\" refers to attitudes and behaviours toward people of other ethnicities or races.) India is ethnically diverse, with more than 2,000 different ethnic groups. There is also significant diversity within regions, and almost every province has its own distinct mixture of ethnicities, traditions, and culture. Throughout the history of India, ethnic relations have been both constructive (as with mutual cultural influences) and destructive (as with discrimination against other ethnicities). Public attitudes Usually, people in different regions respect each other's cultures and traditions. According to local sources, unity in diversity has been growing in India, making the country more tolerant. One World Values Survey reported 43.5% of Indians responded that they would prefer not to have neighbors of a different race.A fascinating map of the world‚Äôs most and least racially tolerant countries =North-East Indians= In recent years discrimination against people from North-East India has been reported. In 2007, the North East Support Centre & Helpline (NESC&H;) was started as a separate wing of All India Christian Council. Its stated goal is to increase awareness regarding prejudice and attacks against people from North-East India. Many North-Eastern Indians face discrimination; are refused living accommodations when they travel to urban areas to study; and are subjected to racial slurs in reference to the appearance of their eyes. A spokesman for the NESC&H; has stated that abuse and harassment of North- Easterners is increasing. In 2012, in an attempt to prevent such discrimination, the Indian government asked all of its states and union territories to arrest anyone who commits an act of atrocity against a North- Easterner under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. In 2014, a North-Eastern student named Nido Taniam was killed in New Delhi. On 24 January 2014, two women from Manipur were assaulted and thrashed by locals at Kotla Mubarakpur, Delhi. They were at first hurled racial abuses but when they did not react to this, one of the accused tied the leash of his pet dog to one of the women's boots. Then she started kicking the dog away being scared that it would bite her. Then the attackers started beating her and when the other woman intervened, they dragged her out by the hair. According to them, despite being in the lane crowded with people, no one came to help them in October 2014, there were two separate incidents, one in which a North-East student was beaten by three men in Bangalore for not speaking Kannada, and a second where a North-East student was beaten by seven men in Gurgaon, Haryana. =Assam and other North Eastern States= In Assam India, there have been many attacks on those from outside the region. In 2007, thousands of Hindi-speaking labourers fled from Assam after a series of massacres and bomb attacks. In May 2007, nine of them were killed and another 20 injured in violent attacks.Subir Bhaumik (23 May 2007). \\"Persecution of Assam's Hindi speakers\\". BBC The next month, 26 people from other parts of India were killed in a series of attacks over a period of six days.

He was the last surviving cardinal to have been born in the 18th century. Biography Bonnechose was born in Paris. Entering the magistracy, he became attorney-general for the district of Besan√ßon in 1830, but having received holy orders at Strasburg, under the episcopate of Jean Fran√ßois Marie Lepappe de Trevern, he was made professor of sacred eloquence in the school of higher studies founded at Besan√ßon by Cardinal de Rohan. After the death of de Rohan, he went to Rome to settle the differences between Bishop de Trevern and himself, due to philosophical opinions found in his work, \\"Philosophy of Christianity\\", for which Bonnechose had written an introduction. In 1844 he was named by Rome superior of the community of St. Louis. In 1847 he became Bishop of Carcassonne. He was transferred on 4 November 1854 to the see of √âvreux and in 1854 raised to the archiepiscopal see of Rouen. Created cardinal in 1863,Cardinals Created by Pius IX (1861-8) he became ex-officio senator of the empire. The cardinal showed himself a warm advocate of the temporal power of the popes, and firmly protested against the withdrawal of the French army from the Pontifical States. In 1870, he went to Versailles, the headquarters of the German armies, to entreat Wilhelm I of Prussia to reduce the war contribution imposed on the city of Rouen. Under the republican government he uniformly opposed the laws and measures passed against religious congregations and their schools, but endeavored to inspire his clergy to deference and conciliation in their relations with the civil authorities.

He rose to the rank of temporary major general during the Second World War. Wootten earned the respect of his soldiers and superiors; General Douglas MacArthur described him as \\"the best soldier in the Australian Army who had it in him to reach the highest position\\". He was famous, in part, for his heavy build; he had given up smoking in 1930, and by 1941‚Äîeven though he was 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall‚Äîhe weighed 127 kg (20 st).A. J.

Captain George Wootten, Adjutant, 1st Infantry Battalion, shaving at the entrance to his dugout. Wootten was born on 1 May 1893 in Marrickville, Sydney, Australia. He was the seventh child of English, London-born migrant parents, William Frederick Wootten (a carpenter and later a civil engineer) and Louisa Wootten, n√©e Old. George Wootten attended Fort Street Model School in Sydney. He entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1911, and graduated in August 1914 as a lieutenant. First World War Wootten's graduation coincided with the outbreak of the First World War. He was posted to the 1st Battalion, went ashore at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and was promoted to captain in May that year. He was a major by December. Wootten later served on the Western Front. He was Brigade Major with the 11th Brigade, then with the 9th Brigade (under Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal). Wootten was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in October 1917 for staff work. He was then appointed to the staff of the 5th Division. In October 1918, he was appointed to the staff of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Wootten was mentioned in despatches four times. Following the end of hostilities, Wootten was sent to the Staff College, Camberley, England, in March 1919. Civilian life between the wars Wootten married Muriel Frances Anna Bisgood, a nurse, at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Roehampton, London, on 3 January 1920. Wootten was posted back to Australia that same year. He resigned his commission in 1923, and moved back to London, where he worked as manager of a clothing factory. Wootten returned to New South Wales in 1926 and became an articled clerk at West Wyalong. He was also recruited by a secret, quasi-official militia organisation, the Old Guard, which had been formed in response to fears of a supposed communist revolutionary threat. Wootten was admitted as a solicitor in July 1930, by which time he had four children. In 1931 he became an organiser for the Old Guard in Sydney and after retiring from the army, was one of its handful of full-time staff. Samer, France, 16 December 1917. Major George Wootten DSO (right) at the time a staff officer with the 5th Division. Wootten joined the Citizen Military Forces (CMF; the army reserve corps) and on 1 July 1937‚Äîas a lieutenant colonel‚Äîwas appointed commander of the 21st Light Horse Regiment. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, on 13 October 1939, Wootten was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force, and from 24 October 1939 until 9 February 1940 he commanded the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. He then served as acting commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade until 20 May 1940. I Corps was attached to the British Middle East Command, and when an AIF Reinforcement Depot was set up in Palestine, in late 1940, Wootten was promoted to temporary brigadier and made its commander. Wootten was promoted to brigadier, and from 1 February 1941, he commanded the 18th Infantry Brigade (7th Division), on active service in the North African campaign, including the siege of Tobruk. Following the outbreak of war with Japan, the 7th Division returned to Australia and the 18th Brigade was part of the historic victory over Japanese forces at Milne Bay. This was followed by the fierce and costly fighting at Buna and Sanananda. On 15 March 1943, Wootten was promoted to temporary major general and became General Officer Commanding, 9th Australian Infantry Division. Between September that year and January 1944 he led the 9th Division in the Battle of Lae and the Huon Peninsula campaign. After a year of leave, consolidation, and re-training in Australia, the 9th took part in the Borneo campaign, including Operation Oboe Six, the amphibious landings at Brunei and Labuan. Wootten's nephew, Driver Evans, was a prisoner of war in Borneo who took part in one of the Sandakan death marches, and was killed at Ranau.Wall, nd, 224 Batu Lintang POW/internment camp, Kuching, Sarawak, 12 September 1945. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Wootten commanded the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit, overseeing the recuperation and repatriation of Allied prisoners, surrendered Japanese personnel, and the transition back to civilian rule. Wootten returned to Sydney on 22 September, and transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 14 October. However, he was soon appointed to a military court of inquiry into Major General Gordon Bennett's departure from Singapore in 1942. In 1945‚Äì58, Wootten chaired the Repatriation Commission, in Melbourne. He commanded the 3rd Division (CMF), in 1947‚Äì50 and was the CMF member of the Military Board in 1948‚Äì50.

The vessel also ran on the Prince Rupert-Port Hardy Inside Passage route during the low season. Built in 1965, Queen of Prince Rupert was decommissioned on April 20, 2009 following the launch of and was replaced by on the Prince Rupert-Skidegate Route. On May 4, 2011, the official registration of Queen of Prince Rupert was closed.http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/Saf- Sec-Sur/4/vrqs-srib/d.aspx?lang=e&shipid;=323870 The vessel was sold to Goundar Shipping Company of Fiji and renamed MV Lomaiviti Princess. The vessel departed British Columbia waters bound for Fiji on August 5, 2011. History Queen of Prince Rupert was built by Victoria Machinery Depot Co. Ltd (VMD), Victoria and completed in 1966 as the first BC Ferries vessel to serve the Inside Passage from northern Vancouver Island to Prince Rupert. It was the flagship of the fleet until was added to the run in 1980. The designer of the vessel was Danish naval architecture firm Knud E. Hansen. The keel was laid down on November 30, 1964Dogwood Fleet : The Story of the British Columbia Ferry Authority from 1958. Cadieux and Griffiths, 1967, p. 114. and the ship launched on October 15, 1965.Pardon B.C. Ferry's Slip. Vancouver Sun, Oct 16, 1965. The launching did not proceed without incident. The traditional smashing of a champagne bottle against the hull was to be performed by the wife of the Speaker of the Legislature, W H Murray. Moments before, however, a young boy ran across the dock and tripped over the rope which restrained the chains holding the vessel to the ways. Instead of being launched by the pull of a lever, Queen of Prince Rupert was sent down the ways prematurely by accident. Mrs. Murray belatedly pulled a second lever to propel the champagne bottle, but it missed the boat. Harold Husband, president of VMD, grabbed the bottle on its return swing and tried to smash it against the hull, but the bottle only bounced off. Then the winds pushed the unpowered vessel directly towards a grain dock. Nearby tugboats quickly moved in to keep Queen of Prince Rupert out of danger. To ensure that there would be no bad luck associated with an improperly christened ship, Mrs. Murray later \\"threw another bottle of bubbly at the frisky ferry\\" as it lay tied up to a pier. From 1966 to 1979, the route operated from Kelsey Bay, the northern limit of the highway system on Vancouver Island at the time. In its inaugural year, Queen of Prince Rupert made the journey in 20 hours, departing at 1:30 pm from Prince Rupert and Kelsey Bay on alternate days. A one way fare was $30, while the cost for an automobile and driver was $60. There were 16 deluxe staterooms on the Bridge Deck, with two berths, shower and bathroom ($11.50 per berth); 22 outside and 55 inside semi-deluxe staterooms on the Promenade Deck, with bathroom ($10.00 and $8.50 per berth); and on the Lower Deck or Tween Deck; 30 2-berth staterooms (5.50 per berth) and 9 4-berth rooms ($18 for the room). Public showers were located on the Tween deck. In the 1977‚Äì1978 season, passenger rates were still $30 between Kelsey Bay and Prince Rupert, while cars were $40 alone. A notable change to the route was made that season during the fall to spring schedule. The ship departed from Tsawwassen, enabling northerners to travel directly from Prince Rupert to Vancouver by sea. On the October‚ÄìApril schedule, the ship left Tsawwassen Mondays at 8:00 am, stopping at Kelsey Bay and Bella Bella, arriving at Prince Rupert at 6:00 pm Tuesday. Turnaround time was quick, as it departed for the south again at 10:30 pm, reaching Tsawwassen at 6.30 am Thursday. The Thursday to Sunday run called in at Ocean Falls.BC Ferries MV Queen of Prince Rupert schedule, 1977‚Äì1978 In 1979, the North Island Highway was completed through to Port Hardy, and a new terminal built at nearby Bear Cove. In 1980, Queen of the North entered service on the Inside Passage route. The BC government decided to utilize Queen of Prince Rupert on the tourist run from Victoria to Seattle, replacing the coastal steamship Princess Marguerite. In what was seen by many as a politically expedient move, they leased Queen of Prince Rupert to the BC Steamship Corporation when Princess Marguerite was found to violate US pollution requirements. The vessel was renamed Victoria Princess. To enable loading at Victoria's Inner Harbour, a side-loading door was installed. Victoria Princess only operated on the route for one summer, however, and in November, 1980, returned to the BC Ferries fleet as Queen of Prince Rupert to begin its service between Prince Rupert and Skidegate. When Queen of the North sank on March 22, 2006, Queen of Prince Rupert was in drydock undergoing its annual refit. She was quickly pressed back into service, and made her first voyage of the season less than a month later. On April 20, 2006, the vessel made her first crossing through Wright Sound where her sister ship had sunk. Queen of Prince Rupert stopped at the spot and passengers threw into the water 99 white roses (the number of people rescued) and two red roses (for the two people missing and presumed dead).Sunken B.C. ferry honoured by passing ship Queen of Prince Rupert continued covering both the Inside Passage and Queen Charlotte Islands routes until the replacement Northern Adventure was ready for service in March 2007. This necessitated considerably reduced service in the busy summer tourism season, and had a significant effect on the economies of coastal communities. Previous to the Queen of the North disaster, crew quarters on both vessels were below the waterline, beneath the car deck. Passenger staterooms below the waterline had not been used for a number of years, but the crew's bunks and mess continued in use. Immediately after the sinking, however, the passenger cabins on Queen of Prince Ruperts Promenade deck were given over to the crew, greatly reducing the number of staterooms available to travellers, but ensuring the safety of the crew. Queen of Prince Rupert was decommissioned at a ceremony in Prince Rupert on April 20, 2009. The new Northern Expedition as well as the newly purchased Northern Adventure (which is Queen of Prince Ruperts replacement on the Prince Rupert ‚Äì Skidegate route) were present along with Queen of Prince Rupert in Prince Rupert Harbour on April 19, 2009, marking the only time to date that all three vessels were in the same location together.

Set on a factory floor of 'Lillicrap Ltd', it starred a blacked up Spike Milligan as an Irishman of Pakistani heritage named Kevin O'Grady, who also featured in episode 7 of the fifth series of Speight's Till Death Us Do Part. It also featured Eric Sykes as the foreman, Norman Rossington as the shop steward, and other regulars were Kenny Lynch, and Sam Kydd. The series was written by Till Death Us Do Part writer Johnny Speight, but based on an idea by Milligan. The programme was cancelled for its use of crude and racist humour. It was the first LWT sitcom to be broadcast in its entirety in colour, and all episodes still exist. Controversy The ambition of Curry and Chips was purportedly to highlight discrimination, rather than promote it. The Independent Television Authority disagreed, and Curry and Chips was cancelled by them after only six episodes. Speight himself later remarked, \\"It was the English who were made to look bigoted in the show but the people at the ITA couldn't understand that. It was London Weekend Television's first year, but only six shows went out. The ITA made LWT take it off, saying it was racist.\\" They were not alone, as amongst those who originally complained about the show were the Race Relations Board. Screenonline says of the show, \\"though it again attempted to raise important questions, [it] lacked a strong enough voice to challenge the racist attitudes of its characters, and too much of its humour relied on the use of crude racial abuse and Milligan's caricatured performance as the charmlessly-nicknamed 'Paki Paddy'. The shocked reaction from some viewers and cultural commentators led to the show being dropped by ITV after just six episodes, and in retrospect it is hard to understand how Speight and LWT can have failed to anticipate the offence it caused.\\" The show was also controversial for the number of swear words in it. The word 'bloody' was used 59 times in one episode, although Eric Sykes refused to swear until doing so, once, in the final episode. Six years later, Milligan once again blacked up in the BBC series The Melting Pot. Only one episode was shown, and the other five were pulled. Johnny Speight would again ask Spike Milligan to black up on two occasions for his BBC sitcom Till Death us do Part, one of which was to play the part originally created for Curry and Chips, Paki-Paddy.

Over the span of three years by 2007,https://web.archive.org/web/20190315095655/https://www.solutions- site.org/node/258 more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South India where the electricity grid does not yet extend.Consumer financing program for solar home systems in southern India Launched in 2003, the Indian Solar Loan Programme was a four-year partnership between UNEP, the UNEP Risoe Centre, and two of India's largest banks, the Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.https://web.archive.org/web/20190315095655/https://www.solutions- site.org/node/258 The Indian Solar Loan Program was established in 2003 in the Karnataka State of Southern India, in order to bring Solar Home Systems (SHS) to rural households in the area. Historically, the Karnataka State has relied on kerosene lanterns for light. This option is not nearly as bright as solar options. It also poses a higher risk of danger, as kerosene lanterns emit unhealthy smoke and fumes, and they are known to burn people. Also, much of rural India has little to no access to the electric grid. Therefore SHS is a highly effective lighting system available to this area due to its reliability and its low impact on the environment, however it is more expensive than other lighting options, which is why loans are necessary in order for it to be successfully implemented in rural India. Loans from the Indian Solar Loan Programme are available to households and small businesses. Borrowers pay for 15% of the lighting system up front and then continue to repay the loan over the course of 5 years. This program works well in India because of its previously established solar lighting vendors, and because of its already successful banking system. In India, banks are required to lend 40% of their loans to ‚Äúpriority purposes‚Äù - causes that have a positive social impact. Because the Indian Solar Loan Program involves a feasible social benefit, many Indian banks have gotten involved. In fact, 1/3 of the bank branches in Karnataka are involved in the program. The following banks are a part of the Indian Solar Loan Program: Canara Bank, Tungabhadra Grameen, Chitradurga Grameen, Sahyadri Grameen, Kolar Grameen, Syndicate Bank, Bijapur Grameen, Malaprabha Grameen, Varada Grameen, Netravathi Grameen. Vendors involved in the program are: Kotak Urja Private Limited, Selco Solar Light Private Limited, Shell Solar India Private Limited, Tata BP Solar India Limited. The Indian Solar Loan Programme is only available to people living above the poverty line. People living below the poverty line can access Solar Home Systems from Self Help Groups. The Indian Solar Loan Programme however does give loans to these Self Help Groups, therefore allowing people living below the poverty line to access Solar Home Systems. According to surveys recording customer satisfaction, recipients of loans have been overall happy with the program. 5% of customers reported they found the program to be ‚Äúvery good‚Äù, 92% said it was ‚Äúgood‚Äù and 3% said they were ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù with the outcome of their involvement. Though this program is still most present in the Karnataka State, similar programs have also begun in nearby Kerala State and Andhra Pradesh State.

He was introduced to film industry by his preceptor Mr. Gayudu (1927-2005), who was a famous actor, director, writer, singer and music director, make-up artist and also owned the costumes related to mythological dramas. Initially, Mr. Gayudu was selected for the role of Bhishma in the movie Bhishma and N. T. Rama Rao was offered the role of Duryodhana, but, due to a conspiracy to wedge Mr.Gayudu from entering the film industry, the Art Director of the movie, Mr. Vali, was arrested and made a deal out of it with Mr. Gayudu that if he drops out of the role of Bheeshma which he was offered and instead play the role of Duryodhana, he could get Vali released. Mr. Gayudu wasn't ready to accept the deal but for the sake of his friend Vali, he dropped out of the movie stating, his student Dhulipala, is capable enough to play Duryodhana. When NTR thanked him for dropping out of the movie, Mr.Gayudu replied showing him all the letters and telegrams that he received earlier, \\"I am backing off for the sake of my friend Vali. No matter how much you succeed in your career, don't forget that I was the first preference for the lead role of every movie and you had always been the second choice, as I couldn't make it on time and you grabbed the opportunities. I received Vendi Gada (Silver Gada) from Mysore Maharaja as a token of gratitude. That's my greatest achievement\\". Mr.Gayudu headed back home and never turned around. He realized that his brothers were right, as they said \\"Talent is injurious to career and life\\". Hence, Dhulipala who was popular on the stage in the role of Duryodhana, made his debut with that film. Mr. Gayudu was the first choice for every lead role in mythological movies but his family members didn't want him to enter the film industry as they feared for his well being after his uncle, the great actor Dommeti Surya Narayana was assassinated by his rivals, as he was the first generation superstar of Telugu film industry and was still thriving. so they concealed every letter and telegram that Mr.Gayudu received offering him the lead roles to work for their movies.Dhulipala photo gallery - Telugu cinema actor Dhulipala entered film industry in 1960, with the movie Bhishma, portraying the role of Duryodhana. He acted in around 300 movies and won several accolades and awards. He was a staunch devotee of Hanuman and was inspired by Swami Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham to take sanyas in 2001 and establish Maruthi Ashram at Guntur City. He died on 13 April 2007. He was survived by his wife and two sons.idleburra.com Selected filmography * Murari (2001) * Choodalani Vundi (1998) * Mahashakti (1980) * Jaganmohini (1978) * Daana Veera Soora Karna (1977) as Shakuni * Kurukshetram (1977) as Indra * Seeta Kalyanam (1976) as Vasishta Mahamuni * Mahakavi Kshetrayya (1976) * Sita Swayamvar (1976) as Vishwamitra * Gunavantudu (1975) * Sree Rama Anjaneya Yuddham (1974) * Andala Ramudu (1973) as Secretary * Bala Bharatam (1972) as Sakhuni * Mattilo Manikyam (1971) * Balaraju Katha (1970) * Ekaveera (1969) as Father of Veerabhupati * Aatmiyulu (1969) as Veerayya * Bandhavyalu (1968) * Undamma Bottu Pedata (1968) * Shri Krishnavataram (1967) as Satrajit * Bobbili Yuddham (1964) as Narasarayalu * Nartanasala (1963) as Duryodhana * Sri Krishnarjuna Yuddham (1963) as Gayudu * Mahamantri Timmarusu (1962) * Bhishma (1962) as Duryodhana References Category:Male actors in Telugu cinema Category:Indian male film actors Category:People from Guntur Category:1921 births Category:Nandi Award winners Category:2007 deaths Category:Telugu people Category:Male actors from Andhra Pradesh Category:20th-century Indian male actors ","title":"Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry"},{"id":"10792913","text":"The interior of Marybone Chapel on Vere Street, by William Hogarth.

TXC was used as the designation at first, but this was later changed as TXC sounded too much like TXE the code used for later electronic exchanges. Prior to this the GPO had standardised on Strowger for automatic switching and had resisted the adoption of Crossbar, preferring to wait for its electronic switching research to bear fruit. The development of electronic systems however took longer than anticipated and the British equipment manufacturers, particularly Automatic Telephone & Electric (ATE), which later became part of the Plessey group feared that continuing to focus the bulk of their production on Strowger equipment would harm their export sales as Crossbar had already become popular throughout the world. In response to this, ATE, and later Plessey, developed their own crossbar system, the 5005, and pushed for the GPO to adopt it as an interim measure. Normally the GPO preferred to develop systems in co-operation with the manufacturing companies, from whom they could then purchase competitively rather than allowing one manufacturer to sell it a proprietary system. The situation however was becoming critical, waiting lists for telephone service in the UK were growing embarrassingly long and the manufacturers were becoming more and more reluctant to supply Strowger in the quantities needed by the GPO. Eventually the GPO relented and decided to accept Crossbar equipment into its network.  TXK1  This code was given to Plessey's 5005A switch, which was used for local exchanges in non-director areas or group switching centres / sector switching centres (tandem exchanges). The 5005A was a two wire version of the 5005, meaning the transmit & receive speech was routed through the switch over one pair of wires. The first one was installed at Broughton, Preston in 1964 as a field trial replacing Broughton's manual exchange. The village was chosen due to its relative proximity to the Plessey factory and research centre at Edge Lane, Liverpool. Mainstream installation of TXK1s commenced in 1968, and many were installed throughout the UK until the late 1970s when the more modern TXE4 electronic system became available. TXK1 remained in use in the BT network until March 1994, when the last one at Droitwich, Worcestershire was replaced with a digital exchange. The Plessey 5005 was made up of routers and distributors. A distributor performed subscriber concentration and could serve up to 500 lines. A router made up the core of the exchange for switching traffic between distributors or between a distributor and an external junction/trunk. The exchange at Broughton was initially dimensioned to serve 2,000 lines and therefore had four distributors and one router. A 5005 could serve up to 100,000 lines, but no inland exchanges of this size were used in the UK. TXK was also manufactured by GEC Telecommunications of Coventry based on the Plessey 5005 design. GEC provided Sector Switching Centres in the London director area at Ilford, Wood Green, Colindale, Ealing, Kingston, Croydon and Eltham. These exchanges were controlled by the GEC designed Mk 1c processor. TXK2 Paddington, Sydney, Australia. This code was used for Plessey 5005T exchanges which was a 4 wire version of the 5005 (separate pair for transmit & receive). In the UK TXK2s were only used as an international gateway, initially at Wood Street (WS) exchange in the City of London. This switch had been previously sold by Plessey to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission Australia (OTC) for use as an international gateway at Sydney. The British Post Office was planning with Plessey Ltd for a switch at Wood Street but with advanced facilities. Plessey was in difficulty with this development and could not make Wood Street work on time and in-budget. As OTC had replaced their 5005T with an Ericsson switch, so the 5005T was air-freighted back to the UK in desperation to be put into service at Wood Street. The 5005T was identical to the 5005A except for the 4 wire switching, the lack of subscriber line circuits and concentration stage (i.e. no distributors). The switch which Plessey struggled with was also 4-wire but controlled by manual boards! The tallest boards ever made at the Beeston factory! The cords, of course, did not carry the speech. They controlled the routing from end to end via the crossbar 4-wire switches. The operators selected the route and the crossbar used mass- marking to find a path. One of the problems was the design of the high capacity relay. It was developed from the 3000 type, but with wire-wrap connections and more springs. The lifting comb proved to be difficult to make, and much Araldite was used to rectify the faults. Plessey further supplied the British Post Office with TXK2 switches at DeHavilland ISC (Burnt Oak) and Mondial ISC in Central London. The first switch was similar technically to the Wood St Relief Unit, but the latter was larger and came with the developments of Codesender Router and Line Terminations for CCITT R2 (MF(C) with E&M; line signalling). TXK3 TXK3 was the code allocated to STC's BXB 1100, a 2 wire version of the French Pentaconta system. It was used by the GPO for local exchanges in director areas (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow) and for some non-director exchanges in Northern Ireland. The first one opened at Edinburgh Liberton in 1971. TXK4 This code was used for STC's BXB1121 which was a four-wire version of the French Pentaconta system, used by the British Post Office for main trunk exchanges. They were all replaced in the 1980s by System X. TXK5 & 6 These codes were allocated to two Ericsson Crossbar systems used as international gateways in London. TXK5 was LM Ericsson ARM200 and TXK6 was the same manufacturer's AKE13 system.

Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, radiotelephones, walkie-talkies, CB radios, cable television converter boxes satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A frequency synthesizer may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output are related to the stability and accuracy of its reference frequency input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by crystal oscillators. Types Three types of synthesizer can be distinguished. The first and second type are routinely found as stand- alone architecture: direct analog synthesis (also called a mix-filter-divide architecture as found in the 1960s HP 5100A) and the more modern direct digital synthesizer (DDS) (table-look-up). The third type are routinely used as communication system IC building-blocks: indirect digital (PLL) synthesizers including integer-N and fractional-N. =Digiphase synthesizer= It is in some ways similar to a DDS, but it has architectural differences. One of its big advantages is to allow a much finer resolution than other types of synthesizers with a given reference frequency.  History  Prior to widespread use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual retuning was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem. Quartz crystal resonators are many orders of magnitude more stable than LC circuits and when used to control the frequency of the local oscillator offer adequate stability to keep a receiver in tune. However the resonant frequency of a crystal is determined by its dimensions and cannot be varied to tune the receiver to different frequencies. One solution is to employ many crystals, one for each frequency desired, and switch the correct one into the circuit. This \\"brute force\\" technique is practical when only a handful of frequencies are required, but quickly becomes costly and impractical in many applications. For example, the FM radio band in many countries supports 100 individual channel frequencies from about 88 MHz to 108 MHz; the ability to tune in each channel would require 100 crystals. Cable television can support even more frequencies or channels over a much wider band. A large number of crystals increases cost and requires greater space. The solution to this was the development of circuits which could generate multiple frequencies from a \\"reference frequency\\" produced by a crystal oscillator. This is called a frequency synthesizer. The new \\"synthesized\\" frequencies would have the frequency stability of the master crystal oscillator, since they were derived from it. Many techniques have been devised over the years for synthesizing frequencies. Some approaches include phase locked loops, double mix, triple mix, harmonic, double mix divide, and direct digital synthesis (DDS). The choice of approach depends on several factors, such as cost, complexity, frequency step size, switching rate, phase noise, and spurious output. Coherent techniques generate frequencies derived from a single, stable master oscillator. In most applications, a crystal oscillator is common, but other resonators and frequency sources can be used. Incoherent techniques derive frequencies from a set of several stable oscillators. The vast majority of synthesizers in commercial applications use coherent techniques due to simplicity and low cost. Synthesizers used in commercial radio receivers are largely based on phase-locked loops or PLLs. Many types of frequency synthesizer are available as integrated circuits, reducing cost and size. High end receivers and electronic test equipment use more sophisticated techniques, often in combination. System analysis and design A well-thought-out design procedure is considered to be the first significant step to a successful synthesizer project. In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many \\"best\\" design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), frequency stability (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), switching time (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost. James A. Crawford says that these are mutually contradictive requirements. Influential early books on frequency synthesis techniques include those by Floyd M. Gardner (his 1966 Phaselock techniques) and by Venceslav F. Kroupa (his 1973 Frequency Synthesis). Mathematical techniques analogous to mechanical gear- ratio relationships can be employed in frequency synthesis when the frequency synthesis factor is a ratio of integers. This method allows for effective planning of distribution and suppression of spectral spurs. Variable-frequency synthesizers, including DDS, are routinely designed using Modulo-N arithmetic to represent phase. Principle of PLL synthesizers :See main article: Phase-locked loop A phase locked loop is a feedback control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that is proportional to the difference between their phases.Phase is the integral of frequency. Controlling the phase will also control the frequency. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer. Block diagram of a common type of PLL synthesizer. The key to the ability of a frequency synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually in the form of a digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock signal. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system. =Example= Suppose the reference signal is 100 kHz, and the divider can be preset to any value between 1 and 100. The error signal produced by the comparator will only be zero when the output of the divider is also 100 kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100 kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100 kHz for a count of 1, 200 kHz for a count of 2, 1 MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of the reference frequency can be obtained with the simplest integer N dividers. Fractional N dividers are readily available. Practical considerations Philips TDA6651TT - 5 V mixer/oscillator and low noise PLL synthesizer for hybrid terrestrial tuner In practice this type of frequency synthesizer cannot operate over a very wide range of frequencies, because the comparator will have a limited bandwidth and may suffer from aliasing problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, it is hard to make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of varactor diodes. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band. Many radio applications require frequencies that are higher than can be directly input to the digital counter. To overcome this, the entire counter could be constructed using high-speed logic such as ECL, or more commonly, using a fast initial division stage called a prescaler which reduces the frequency to a manageable level. Since the prescaler is part of the overall division ratio, a fixed prescaler can cause problems designing a system with narrow channel spacings ‚Äì typically encountered in radio applications. This can be overcome using a dual-modulus prescaler. Further practical aspects concern the amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how much noise there is in the output. All of these are a function of the loop filter of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator is in the form of short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes frequency modulation of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with harmonics. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer will concentrate on when building a synthesizer system.  Use as a frequency modulator  Many PLL frequency synthesizers can also generate frequency modulation (FM). The modulating signal is added to the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the modulating signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with opposite polarity to the modulating signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.Gardner1966 This scheme therefore cannot directly handle low frequency (or DC) modulating signals but this is not a problem in the many AC-coupled video and audio FM transmitters that use this method. Such signals may also be placed on a subcarrier above the cutoff frequency of the PLL loop filter.

Biography Dixson was born in George Street, Sydney, the son of Hugh Dixson and his wife Helen, n√©e Craig. He was educated at the Elfred House Private School kept by William Timothy Cape at Paddington. At 14 years of age, Dixson went to work at a timber yard for Phillip McMahon. In 1856, he joined the tobacco business founded by his father, and became a partner in it in 1864. In 1866, he married Emma Elizabeth (1844‚Äì1922), daughter of William Edward Shaw. The business grew steadily and, after his father's death in 1880, expanded rapidly under the management of Hugh Dixson and his brother Robert Dixson. It was subsequently merged in the British- Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, probably the largest business of its kind in Australia at the time. Philanthropy After retirement, Dixson and his wife continued their interest in the Baptist Church and in various philanthropic institutions. An early substantial gift was ¬£5000 as the beginning of a fund to present a battleship to Britain. This fund was not successful and Dixson's gift was devoted to educating British boys at Australian agricultural colleges. In addition to seeking to fund a battleship for Britain, Dixson supported other patriotic causes. One such cause was the Legion of Frontiersmen, a patriotic, paramilitary organisation formed in Britain in 1905 by Roger Pocock, a former constable with the North West Mounted Police and Boer War veteran, to bolster the defensive capacity of the British Empire. A gift of ¬£10,000 helped the establishment of an aged and infirm ministers' fund in the Baptist Church, and much assistance was given to the building of churches in various parts of the state. A sum of ¬£20,000 was used to build a cancer wing at the Ryde home for incurables. Dixson, at various times, served as president of the Baptist Union, of the Baptist Home Mission Society, and of YMCA. Dixson was a noted horticulturist, becoming a member of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in 1887, and the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1898. He was knighted in the 1921 Birthday Honours. Dixson died at Colombo on 11 May 1926, and was survived by two sons, including Sir William Dixson, and four daughters. In 1900, Emma Dixson founded the Sydney Medical Mission, a service run by women for women of the poorer areas of the city. She was a vice-president of the League of Boy Scouts, and became the patron of the 1st Dulwich Hill Scout Group (known as \\"Mrs Emma Dixson's Own\\"), donating the land and paying for the construction of the scout hall. Extensions to the scout hall were built in 1924 by the Dixson children, as a memorial to their mother. In 1919, she gifted six houses in Surry Hills to the Royal Society for the Welfare of Mothers and Babies, to set up a model welfare centre. It was opened in 1922, after Emma Dixson's death, by one of her daughters, and named the Emma Elizabeth Dixson Welfare Centre; the day care centre which was part of it was known in abbreviated form as the Emma Dlxson Day Nursery. She was a life governor of the Queen Victoria Homes for Consumptives, the Crown Street Women's Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and of The Infants' Home Child and Family Services; president of the women's branch of the Empire League, and after its reorganisation, a life vice-president of the British Empire League in Australia; the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and the Victoria League; president of the women's auxiliary of the Sydney City Mission; the only female patron of the Veterans' Home of New South Wales; and vice-president of the New South Wales Home for Incurables, Ryde (to which they gave ¬£20,000), and the Fresh Air League.

Unlike most event promoters at the Fringe, the Free Fringe does not charge performers for use of performance spaces, on the condition that they do not charge an entry fee into their shows. Audience members are, however, asked to make a donation at the end of a show. This business model has been cited as an important development in the Fringe's culture and infrastructure, and has been credited with restoring the \\"idealistic spirit of the Fringe\\". Peter Buckley Hill was awarded the Panel Prize at the 2009 Edinburgh Comedy Awards in recognition. The organisation should not be confused with other promoters of free events at the Fringe, which include Laughing Horse, Just the Tonic and Bob Slayer's Heroes. Free Fringe venues are commonly independently run bars and nightclubs which create performance spaces in their premises for the duration of the Fringe. Predominantly the shows are comedy but the programme has expanded from its comedy roots to include theatre, science, cabaret, music and spoken word. Performers range from newcomers to major names such as Phill Jupitus and established cult figures such as John Otway.PBH Free Fringe programme 2015 History Johnny MacAulay as Nosferatu in the Man of 1000 Farces, Edinburgh Free Fringe Elsie Diamond in a cabaret show, Edinburgh Free Fringe The Free Fringe was started in 1996 by comedian Peter Buckley Hill with the show \\"Peter Buckley Hill And Some Comedians\\". Buckley Hill had lost ¬£4,000 as a performer at the 1994 Fringe. The venues used by the Free Fringe have increased since 1996 from the original Footlights and Firkin venue to (in 2015) 529 free shows on 59 stages - over 9,260 performances. From 2004, Buckley Hill worked with the team behind comedy promoters Laughing Horse on promoting Free Fringe shows. However, the partnership ended in 2006. After the split, the two parties operated separate programmes under the \\"free\\" banner - Buckley Hill continuing to bill his programme the \\"Free Fringe\\", with the Laughing Horse adopting the name the Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival. By 2009, PBH's Free Fringe had 176 shows at 19 venues, a growth of 50% in a year. In 2014 John Kearns won the Edinburgh Comedy Awards main prize with his Free Fringe show, having previously won Best Newcomer in the previous year.

He was also nominated for the Malcolm Hardee Award for Comic Originality in 2008 and in the \\"Most Likely To Make A Million Quid\\" category at the 2014 Malcolm Hardee Awards, where organisers said he would have won the \\"Least Likely To Win A Million Quid\\" Award The Free Fringe has been described as 'the true spirit of the Fringe' by comedian Sean Lock.  Controversy  In 2015, there was a dispute between PBH Free Festival and rival promoters Freestival over the Cowgatehead venue. Freestival believed they had secured the lease for the building and booked a full programme of over 120 events. After the Fringe brochure deadline, by which time most acts had already paid to register their show, PBH Free Fringe announced that they had secured the building and would be booking a programme of their own. Peter Buckley-Hill stated that he would consider applications from Freestival acts if they agreed to the Free Festival \\"Ethos and Conditions\\", which forbid being a permanent member of a show in any rival free venue. The majority of shows were eventually rehoused in venues organised by Just the Tonic and Laughing Horse. Later in 2015, Stephen Carlin was ejected from the Free Fringe and not allowed to continue his run at The Canon's Gait when the Free Fringe organisers realised that he also had a permanent role in a play at a Laughing Horse show. In 2016, Peter Buckley Hill issued an instruction that Free Fringe acts could not use flyering companies which also promoted other free shows, saying that \\"by using a service that leaflets for both without distinction, you are endorsing their tactics of riding on our coat-tails and taking our credit\\".

England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes. London, England: General Register Office - 21 June 1928) was a Welsh pianist. She was one of Theodor Leschetizky's last students and performed in public from childhood. Her early death cut short a promising career just as she began to record for one of the major English labels, having already amassed a considerable discography for one of its second-rank competitors.Biographical sketch at the Naxos records Web site, accessed 6 November 2008 Life Marie Novello was born in 1884 in Maesteg, Glamorgan, the daughter of collier and musician William Thomas Williams and Anne Bedlington Kirkhouse.Ancestry: Welsh censuses and Probate Records She owed her name to adoption by her piano teacher, Clara Novello Davies, mother of Ivor Novello and also a celebrated singing teacher. Following studies with her adoptive mother, Marie was among the last students of Theodor Leschetizky studying with him in Vienna between 1905 and 1907.Glamorgan Archives, Women's Archive of Wales/Archif Menywod Cymru: Marie Novello Papers (DWAW28) Novello's professional career began early. In July 1899, at the age of fifteen, Novello won the Gold Medal piano prize at the Welsh National Eisteddfod in Cardiff, and she shared piano playing honors with Ferruccio Busoni at the September 1907 Cardiff Triennial Music Festival.Cardiff Triennial Music Festival (1907), concert programmes collection, British Library, Music Collection In 1908, she toured the English provinces with a company assembled by Percy Harrison, a promoter who regularly organized such groups; among her compatriots were John McCormack, fresh from his first season at the Royal Opera House and participating in a Harrison tour for the first time, and Emma Albani.The John McCormack Society, Biography of John McCormack, Chapter 2 Around the same time, Novello performed at Wigmore Hall, then known as Bechstein Hall. A year later, in 1909, she made the first of her seven appearances at the Promenade Concerts, when on 22 September she played the Piano Concerto no. 1 in E-flat by Franz Liszt accompanied by the Queen's Hall Orchestra led by Sir Henry Wood. She repeated that appearance every year until 1914, with two appearances in 1912, always in concerted works accompanied by the same forces. Besides the Liszt concerto, which she reprised in 1910, she performed the same composer's Hungarian Fantasia (1911 and 1912); Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto no. 1 in G minor, Op. 25 (1912); and the Africa Fantasy, Op. 89, of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (1913 and 1914).BBC Proms Archive Web site, accessed 14 August 2011 Aside from these festival performances, Novello performed regularly in London, often as one of multiple soloists sharing a recital. In her early twenties, she began appearing at Ballad Concerts and Sunday League Concerts and in music festivals at Brighton and Cardiff. Novello traveled to the United States in late 1921, arriving on 28 December aboard the White Star Line liner RMS Olympic.\\"Marie Novello Arrives\\", The New York Times, 29 December 1921 On 23 February 1922, she made her New York debut at The Town Hall, where she played a program including works of Chopin, Domenico Scarlatti, Debussy, Selim Palmgren, and Ede Poldini.\\"Marie Novello, Pianist, in Debut\\", The New York Times, 24 February 1922, accessed 5 November 2008 On 21 January 1923 she made her recital debut in Chicago at the Playhouse under the auspices of F. Wight Neumann. During this period, she made numerous recordings for the English Edison Bell company. Marie Novello recorded reproducing piano rolls for the Aeolian Company's Duo-Art system;Duo-Art Piano Roll Catalogue , Albert M. Petrak, ed. The Reproducing Piano Roll Foundation, accessed 6 November 2008 doubtless as a fruit of this connection, she once partnered with a reproducing piano in a public performance of the Variations on a Theme of Beethoven for two pianos, four hands by Saint-Sa√´ns. A few years later, at the dawn of electrical recording, she formed an association with HMV, but she died when she had recorded only a few sides. Novello died on 21 June 1928 at her home in London from endothelioma of the pharynx and soft palate and was buried in Maesteg Cemetery. Repertory and Style In her choice of repertory, Novello showed preference for music of the romantic era and particular affinity for virtuoso works such as Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor. She did not entirely neglect contemporary works, however; she achieved notice for performing the premiere of the Rhapsody on Tipperary for piano and orchestra by Frank Tapp, a composer well represented in English concert halls at the time but now forgotten. She then took the work on tour throughout the United Kingdom.BritishClassicalMusic.com Critical reception to her work appears to have been mixed, with more than one suggestion that she tended toward impulsiveness and a lack of firm control. Her tone sometimes drew critical disparagement but critics praised her technical facility and capacity to communicate. Recordings Novello evidently had some interest in the mechanical reproduction of sound, as, on 14 June 1924, she participated as a judge in a public competition between gramophones sponsored by The Gramophone magazine. Her fellow judges included Alfred Kalisch, Percy Scholes, Peter Latham, Alec Robertson, and Francis Brett Young. Over the course of the evening, the judges and the audience of 400 marked ballots comparing the performance of some 15 different machines divided into two price classes, nearly all bearing names now long forgotten. She joined her compatriots in unanimous preference for a machine called The Three Muses reproducing the Adagio from Beethoven's Spring Sonata performed by Albert Sammons and William Murdoch; that vote was the sole instance of a unanimous panel, and her other opinions are not recorded. During the interval, the audience was treated to a demonstration of a reproducing piano, but on the Welte-Mignon system, not the Duo Art for which Novello cut a few rolls.\\"The Gramophone Tests at the Steinway Hall\\", The Gramophone, Vol. II no. 2, July 1924, accessed 19 August 2009] Making her own records almost entirely for Edison Bell, Novello accumulated an extensive discography of acoustic recordings, albeit, as was typical of the time, one weighted heavily to the sort of short works that could fit on one or at most two sides of a 78 RPM record. Her sole multi-disc set was a recording spreading over five sides of Mendelssohn's Op. 25 piano concerto.

It is an all-metal, shoulder- wing monoplane of pod-and-boom configuration, equipped with a pusher propeller, side-by-side seating and fixed tricycle undercarriage.Plane and Pilot: 1978 Aircraft Directory, page 13. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. Development Anderson Greenwood's sole aircraft design was actually a collaborative effort of three engineers: Ben Anderson, Marvin Greenwood & Lomis Slaughter Jr. The name of the last member of the design team was not included in the product name as it was thought it would not boost sales. The prototype first flew in October 1947, but plans to mass-produce the aircraft were interrupted by the Korean War. Eventually, only five more examples were built before Anderson Greenwood abandoned the project in favour of producing aircraft components for other manufacturers. The aircraft's design placed the wing behind the cabin and allowed easy entry via automobile- like doors on each side of the cabin. The propeller is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap handle on the cabin floor between the seats. The engine starter is foot- actuated and the nose-wheel steering is connected to the control wheel. Wind tunnel testing determined that a shoulder wing was ideal for minimal wing-body airflow separation that is intrinsic to a pusher configuration. The aspect ratio of 9.6:1 was high for aircraft at the time it was designed. The wing has 7 degrees of dihedral for directional stability. A four inch propeller shaft extension allows the engine to be mounted closer to the aircraft's center of gravity. The nose gear steers through the control yoke and not the rudder pedals. The AG-14 has very good visibility and one reviewer termed it \\"amazing\\". The aircraft was certified on 20 September 1950 in the normal category. The certification includes a prohibition on aerobatics and spins. One reviewer termed it as \\"positively spin resistant.\\" Serial numbers 1, 2 and 3 were produced in 1950, while 4 and 5 were built in 1953. The five pre- production prototypes were the only examples built. The retail price of the aircraft was set at $4,200 - $4,500. In 1969 one AG-14 aircraft was acquired by Cessna Aircraft Company and taken to Wichita, Kansas for evaluation. Cessna designed and constructed a single prototype aircraft of similar configuration, the Cessna XMC, equipped with a Continental O-200 engine of , with the goal of a possible Cessna 150 replacement. The Cessna evaluation program ran through 1971 and 1972. While performance was similar to a C-150, the aircraft suffered from high cabin noise levels as well as cooling problems, while not providing any performance advantages over the Cessna 150. An AG-14 was also used as the basis of the XAZ-1 Marvelette test bed aircraft built by the Mississippi State University in the 1960s. Operational history In 1986 the Anderson Greenwood Company donated an AG-14, serial number 3, registered as N314AG to the Experimental Aircraft Association Aviation Foundation. By the end of August 2008 it was no longer registered to the foundation. In May 2009 the five production aircraft were still on the US registry listed as Anderson Greenwood AND-51-A. By August 2018 only two remained registered in the US.

The priory of St Frideswide, Oxford, was established as a priory of Augustinian canons regular, in 1122. The priory was established by Gwymund, chaplain to Henry I of England. Among its most illustrious priors were the writers Robert of Cricklade and Philip of Oxford, who were also writers. Cardinal Wolsey dissolved the house in April 1524 to use its premises, together with those of other adjacent religious houses, to found a new college to be called Cardinal College. After Wolsey fell from power in 1530, King Henry VIII took over the nascent foundation, which he renamed \\"Aedes Christi\\" Christ Church, Oxford. The five western bays of the nave of the church of the Augustinian canons were demolished to make space to build the main quadrangle of the new college (now called Tom Quad): and the intention was to demolish the remainder of the church and replace it with a chapel on the north side of the quadrangle. That never happened; and the surviving portion of the church, including the five remaining bays of the nave, became both the chapel for the new college and the cathedral for the new Diocese of Oxford which Henry VIII had separated from the Diocese of Lincoln.

Mission progress * April 20, 2004 Launch of Gravity Probe B  Launch of GP-B from Vandenberg AFB and successful insertion into polar orbit. * April 28, 2004  Mission controllers started the \\"Initialization and Orbit Checkout\\" phase (IOC), which was expected to last 40‚Äì60 days. At this point all gyros were spun up and the SQUID detectors were being checked. All other spacecraft subsystems performed well, including solar power and the attitude control system. * May 1, 2004  During the IOC the primary computer of the spacecraft received too much radiation to cope with the built-in error correction mechanism. GP-B switched over to the backup computer as designed. Since the spacecraft crosses over the polar areas of the Earth with their high radiation, this was anticipated by the designers. The primary computer was repaired and put back into service. All science instruments on board were working perfectly throughout this incident. * May 14, 2004  The spacecraft went into safe mode for a short period when some of the helium micro-thrusters behaved in an unstable way. This problem was addressed quickly and GP-B went back into IOC mode. The cause of this incident was a high-pressure condition in the dewar, which was reached due to warm (10 K) helium being used to remove magnetic flux from the gyroscopes. Mission members believed that the IOC phase would still be completed on time after a total 60 mission days. * July 13, 2004  The preparations for the science phase of the mission reached a major milestone: One of the gyros (No. 4) reached the science-ready speed of 6,348 rpm (105.8 Hz) during a short test. * July 16, 2004  An unexpectedly large slowdown of gyro 4 was detected during the full-speed spin-up of gyro 2. Although some \\"leakage\\" effect was expected, the amount seen led mission planners to search for ways to diminish the effect for this final step towards the science phase. This investigation took close to a week and delayed the planned spin-up of gyro 1 and 3.  Ground tests had indicated that a good signal-to-noise ratio for science data is reached, once the gyro spin rate exceeds 80 Hz. However, mission managers stress that a slightly lower number will also be sufficient for entering the science phase of GP-B. * August 27, 2004  Mission managers announced that GP-B entered its science phase, today. On mission day 129 all systems were configured to be ready for data collection, with the only exception being gyro 4, which needs further spin axis alignment.  After weeks of testing it was decided to use the \\"back-up drag-free\\" mode around gyro 3. Back-up drag-free mode suspends the rotor electrically and flies the thrusters to drive the suspension correction to zero. This contrasts with main drag-free mode which uses no electrical suspension, and flies the thrusters to center the rotor. Also, the rotation period of GP-B was adjusted to 0.7742 rpm (from the original 0.52 rpm planned) in order to make better use of the lower than planned rotor speeds. The spacecraft roll rate is always chosen to avoid harmonic interferences with the sample rate, the orbital rate, the calibration rate and the telemetry data rate during data taking.  They also report that it was planned to continue tuning the drag-free performance of the Attitude and Translation Control (ATC) system in the early portion of the Science Phase to correct for an unknown force, which is causing excess helium flow from the Dewar through the micro thrusters. * September 7, 2004  The main computer suffered a \\"double-bit\\" error in its memory. The location of this error was non-critical to the mission and the function of the spacecraft. A correction that fixed the problem was successfully uploaded. All other subsystems are reported to continue to perform well. * September 16, 2004  Gyro #4 joined Gyro's #1, #2, and #3 in science mode after its spin axis was successfully aligned with the guide star * September 23, 2004  Due to problems with gyro 3, GP-B went into safe mode. The mission team was able to ensure minimal impact to the science by exercising the \\"safing\\" actions of the spacecraft, and switch the control system setup. It is now maintaining the drag-free orbit around gyro 1. * September 24, 2004  The mission went back into science mode. * October 19, 2004  Gyro 1 showed the same behavior as gyro 3 earlier, which prompted mission members to switch back to a drag-free orbit around gyro 3. Adjustments were made to both gyro suspension systems (GSS) to avoid future problems. All this was done in a span of three hours, and science data collection was interrupted only briefly. * November 10, 2004  When passing over the South Atlantic Anomaly during a strong solar storm, a memory error in a critical region put GP-B into safe mode. This incident caused a computer to reboot and put the gyros into \\"analog mode.\\" After about two days all memory problems were fixed and science data became available again. At first, it was assumed a proton hit from the storm was the cause, but later analysis showed that this was not the case. Instead, an earlier error at a presumed non-critical memory position was causing the safe mode, when the memory was accessed during routine maintenance. * Proton flux due to Solar flares, January 2005 January 2005  A series of strong solar flares disrupted data taking for several days. On January 17 a very powerful radiation storm created multi-bit errors in the onboard computer memory, and saturated the telescope detectors so that GP-B lost track of the guide star. The science team, however, is confident that the temporary loss of science data will have no significant effect on the results. On January 20 the high level of proton flux was still generating \\"single bit errors\\" in GP-B memory, but the telescope is locked on the guide star again, and the gyroscope electronics seem to perform nominally. * March 14, 2005  The onboard backup computer (B-side) rebooted after a safe mode event, which came two weeks after the switch-over from the nominal computer (A-side). Both events were triggered by the occurrence of Multi-Bit Errors (MBEs) in the memory of each computer. It took mission members about 29 hours to recover and transfer back to the nominal state, with the guide star locked in. * May 6, 2005  Mission members deduce from a \\"heat pulse test\\" that there is enough liquid helium on board the space craft to cool the experiment until sometime between late August and early September 2005. They are preparing to start the calibration procedures, and thus end the science phase, in early August. * August 15, 2005  The science phase of the mission ended and the spacecraft instruments transitioned to the final calibration mode. * September 26, 2005  The calibration phase ended with liquid helium still in the dewar. The spacecraft was returned to science mode pending the depletion of the last of the liquid helium. * September 29, 2005  The liquid helium in the dewar finally ran out, and the experiment began to warm up.  Drag-free mode turned off. * February 2006  Phase I of data analysis complete * July 10, 2006  uncommanded reboot of the backup CCCA flight computer * August 2006  Completion of Phase II of data analysis * September 2006  Analysis team realised that more error analysis, particularly around the Polhode motion of the gyros, was necessary than could be done in the time to April 2007, and applied to NASA for an extension of funding to the end of 2007. * October 2006  United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) take control of satellite operations * December 2006  Completion of Phase III of data analysis * April 14, 2007  Announcement of best results obtained to date. Francis Everitt gave a plenary talk at the meeting of the American Physical Society announcing initial results: \\"The data from the GP-B gyroscopes clearly confirm Einstein's predicted geodetic effect to a precision of better than 1 percent. However, the frame-dragging effect is 170 times smaller than the geodetic effect, and Stanford scientists are still extracting its signature from the spacecraft data.\\" (Source: Gravity Probe B web site http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/press_releases/SU/pr-aps-041807.pdf) * Spring 2008  Mission update Increasing the Precision of the Results : \\"In reality, GP-B experienced six major or significant anomalies during the 353-day science data collection period, and these anomalies caused the experimental data set to be divided into seven major segments, with a total of 307 days of \\"good\\" science data when all seven segments are combined. This segmentation reduced the best precision obtainable from the 1% goal down to about 2% for the frame-dragging effect and 0.02% for the geodetic effect. This reduced level of precision, if achieved would be extraordinary.\\" http://einstein.stanford.edu/highlights/status1.html * May 2011  Final results are published in a paper in Physical Review Letters and on the arXiv. The results of a geodetic drift rate of ‚àí6,601.8¬±18.3 mas/yr and a frame- dragging drift rate of ‚àí37.2¬±7.2 mas/yr are consistent with the GR predictions of ‚àí6,606.1 mas/yr and ‚àí39.2 mas/yr, respectively. =Future= On February 9, 2007 it was announced that a number of unexpected signals had been received and that these would need to be separated out before final results could be released. Consequently, the date for the final release of data has been pushed back from April 2007 to December 2007. Speculation on some internet sites, such as PhysicsForums.org, has centered around the source and nature of these anomalous signals. Several posters and alternative theorists (some skeptical of GPB and its methodology) have indicated that understanding these signals may be more interesting than the original goal of testing GR. Stanford has agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the December 2007 release. Because future interpretations of the data by scientists outside GPB may differ from the official results, it may take several more years for all of the data received by GPB to be completely understood.

They were granted permanent stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds. Anooshe Ghulam was later granted asylum. The couple had two children.NTB: Kritikk mot politiet i Anooshe-saken Stavanger Aftenblad, 1 September 2003 In summer 2000, she reported her husband to the police for domestic violence. He was incarcerated for a short period. Ghulam sought refuge at a women's center and filed for divorce. After this incident, Anooshe Ghulam was sent to another refugee center, Svanviken flyktningmottak, which was supposed to be a hidden address. Her husband, however, became aware of where she lived. After he was observed in an area near Ghulam, a restraining order was issued against him and he was once arrested for violating it. The murder took place outside the police station in Kristiansund in May 2002, when the two were on their way to court for a custody case. Anooshe spoke fluent English and quickly picked up Norwegian. Her husband, who had been an army general and came from a prominent clan in Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, barely spoke either language. The trial lasted 20 days and Nasruddin was sentenced to 18 years in jail. He claimed the plan originally had not been to kill Ghulam but to kill himself inside the courtroom. The two children were placed in a foster home and given police protection, due to concerns that they might be abducted by Nasruddin's family. Nasruddin's family did not come to the trial, though he has a brother living in Norway. The Norwegian authorities arranged visas for Anooshe's family in Afghanistan to come to the funeral, but they never picked them up. Apparently they were threatened and feared reprisals by Nasruddin's family. During the trial, Nasruddin testified that he had been a refugee in Iran and Russia, but only in Norway did the social services \\"meddle\\" with his private life.

In memory of his parents, Sir John erected a pair of almost life-size monumental brasses in St Decuman's Church, Watchet, and also erected an almost identical pair (considered the finest of their style in England), also set into Purbeck marble, in memory of his uncle Nicholas Wadham and his wife on their chest tomb in the Wadham Chapel in the Church of St Mary, Ilminster. Sir John Wyndham was one of the heirs to the large fortune of his uncle Nicholas Wadham and helped to put into effect his plans for the founding of Wadham College. Sir John Wyndham also erected similar brasses, but much smaller, in St Margaret's Church, Felbrigg, Norfolk, to his cousin Thomas Windham (d. 1599) (in the nave), from whom he inherited Felbrigg Hall, and to Thomas's sister Jane Coningsby (d. 1608) (in the chancel). The inscriptions in accomplished verse on all these monuments are believed to have been written by Wyndham himself.Ketton-Cremer, Robert Wyndham, Felbrigg, the Story of a House, London, 1962, p.32 =Early origins= His grandfather was Sir John Wyndham (died 1573) of Felbrigg (second son of Sir Thomas Wyndham (d. 1521) by his first wife Eleanor Scrope, daughter and heiress of Richard Scrope of Upsall Castle, Yorkshire) who inherited Orchard, Somerset from his wife Elizabeth Sydenham (d. 1 January 1571), daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Sydenham of Orchard, Somerset.Blomefield, op.cit. is in error as he does not derive the Orchard family from Eleanor Scrope, which ancestry is clearly shown in the heraldry in Watchet Church. He erroneously states John Windham (the husband of Elizabeth Sydenham) to be the younger brother of Sir Thomas Windham (d. 1521), therefore the brother-in-law, not son, of Eleanor Scrope Heraldic achievement Heraldic achievement of Sir John Wyndham, Watchet Church The ancestry of Sir John Wyndham is illustrated by the heraldic achievement shown on his monument in Watchet Church.

Birth and childhood Sir John Wyndham is the ancestor of every living member of the widespread Wyndham family (except perhaps for one branch in the United States)Ketton-Cremer, p.31 and therefore had he not been born the dynasty would have failed. However, he was born following a near- miraculous rising from the dead by his mother. The famous story is that one year after her marriage and already pregnant, Florence Wyndham became ill, was thought to have died and was left that evening in a coffin in the Wyndham Chapel in St Decuman's Church, about half a mile east of her husband's home at Kentsford Manor House, and two miles north of her father-in-law's home at Orchard Wyndham, awaiting a funeral the following day.Emeny, Richard, A Description of Orchard Wyndham, 2000, p.2 (guide-booklet available at Orchard Wyndham) That night a \\"covetous sexton\\" crept into the church and in attempting to remove a valuable ring, cut the lady's finger, thereby awakening her from a cataleptic trance. \\"The sexton fled, leaving his lantern behind him, and with its aid she made her way home to her astounded family\\"Ketton- Cremer, p.30 at Kentsford.She probably went to Kentsford Manor House, a secondary Wyndham seat a short distance west of the church, rather than back to Orchard Wyndham, about 2 miles south of the church The story was composed in verse as \\"Lady Wyndham's Return\\", by Rev. Lewis H. Court, Vicar of St Decuman's. (See full text on Wikisource s:Lady Wyndham's Return). Soon after she gave birth to Sir John, who would be her only child. He was a minor aged twelve at the death of his father and as a tenant-in-chief his wardship and marriage reverted to the crown, Queen Elizabeth I, to be granted to whom she pleased. His grandfather, however, was able to buy-back his wardship, which prevented a forced marriage. =Home defence against Spain= He played an important role in the defence organisation of Somerset, the substantial growth of which is shown by the muster in 1580 being 12,000 able footmen, double the total twenty years earlier. The special census of horses taken on 26 August 1583 shows that their number had also increased to forty-seven great horses and 308 light horses. While the defeat of the Spanish Armada saved England from the feared invasion, the significance and value of the defence movement was in keying up the nation and teaching it to realise the heritage it had to defend. =Justice of the Peace= He served as one of the County Justices and as such shared effective responsibility for local government and administration, acting as the representative and general agent of the central government, as well as sitting in quarter sessions. =Civil War= At the start of the Civil War his sympathies appear to have been with the Parliament, which is borne out by a foray made by his cousin Sir Francis Wyndham, 1st Baronet (d. 1676), governor of Dunster Castle, in June 1644 against Orchard Wyndham, as the manor is now known, which resulted in ¬£4,000 worth of plunder being seized for the Royalist cause. Three months after this event he gave ¬£4,000 each for safe keeping to his eighth and ninth sons, Sir Hugh Wyndham and Sir Wadham Wyndham. =Oversees founding of Wadham College= Although Dorothy Wadham was largely responsible for overseeing the foundation and building of Wadham College, OxfordT.G.Jackson; Wadham College Oxford a nephew, possibly Sir John Wyndham, is recorded as attending on his dying uncle Nicholas Wadham (1531/2‚Äì1609). A detailed record, preserved in the College archives, was drawn up by Wyndham of a discussion held with his uncle four days before his death in 1609 as follows: :\\"I was sent for after dinner unto my Uncle Wadham by Mr. Bartlett there beinge present only with him my Aunte, Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Arnold. In the presence of them he told me of the greate care that he had for the erecting of a Colledge in Oxforde, as he had hearetofore often times acquainted me. that for the performance thereof, he had in Mr. Arnold's hands ¬£4,000 with the ¬£500 of Sr. Henry Hawley's, and in Mr. Bartlett's hands which would shortly made up ¬£2,000 which as he thought would be sufficient to procure above ¬£300 p ann; that he had ¬£400 the yeare in Essex, which he left unto my Aunte his wife duringe her life, yet hoped that out of her benevolence consideringe howe well he had dealt with her, that she would imparte a portion of it unto his Colledge during her life. That his desire was to conferre it upon Gloster hall if St Johns Colledge and the Principal might reasonably be compounded withall, otherwise he did appointe it unto Jhesus Colledge. That for the buildinge of a Chappell with buttery sellar and kitchinge he appointed ¬£2,000, whereof (as I understood him) one ¬£1,000 was in his Studye, and the other ¬£1,000 was to be made out of Hewnebeare. That also (as I understood him) he appointed the moitie of the Parsonage of Abbotsbury unto the Colledge. That he must entreat me for the bestowinge of my Travayle and pains for the seinge of all things performed accordinge unto his Intention, as he had often heretofore discoursed with me about it for he did trust me only with it and reposed himself absolutely uppon me, and meant not that it shoulde be any wayes chargeable unto me, for I should have my charges absolutely defrayed in a liberall and a worthie manner to the uttermost\\"...Thomas Graham Jackson, Wadham College, Oxford, its Foundation, Architecture and History, with an Account of the Family of Wadham and their Seats in Somerset and Devon, Oxford, 1893, pp.12-13 Felbrigg inheritance Felbrigg Hall, viewed from the south, as rebuilt circa 1620-24 by Sir John Wyndham for his 3rd son Thomas In 1599 he succeeded to the Felbrigg estate in Norfolk, including Felbrigg Hall, from his father's first cousin Thomas Wyndham (d. 1599), who like his two brothers Sir Roger and Francis (d. 1592), Judge of Common Pleas (whose monument exists in St Peter Mancroft in Norwich) died without issue. Felbrigg was the seat of the senior line of the Wyndham family. In gratitude he placed a monumental brass inlaid in Purbeck marble, in Felbrigg Church. Sir Edmund Wyndham (d. 1568) was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Wyndham (eldest son of Sir John Wyndham (beheaded 1503 on Tower Hill with James Tyrrell) by his first wife Lady Margaret Howard, 4th daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (d. 1485)) by his first wife Alianore Scrope, daughter and heiress of Richard Scrope of Upsall, Yorks. Sir John also placed a monumental brass inlaid in Purbeck marble in Felbrigg Church to Thomas Wyndham's sister Jane Wyndham (d. 1608). Both brasses are in the same style, but much smaller, as those Sir John erected in Watchet church to his parents and in Ilminstaer Church to his uncle Nicholas Wadham. The original accounts concerning the shipping and laying down of the Felbrigg brasses survive in the Wyndham papers at Felbrigg Hall, and although the brasses are known to have been purchased in London, the maker's name is not recorded.Ketton-Cremer, Robert Wyndham, Felbrigg, the Story of a House, London, 1962, p.32 Sir John gave Felbrigg to his third son Thomas Wyndham (d. 1653), for whom he rebuilt the manor house, completed in 1624,Ketton-Cremer, pp.35-6 which survives today.

He inherited part of the lands of his uncle Nicholas Wadham, his mother having been one of his sisters and co-heiresses. Amongst the manors which fell to his share were: *Ilton in Somerset, in which he promptly demolished the former Wadham seat of Merryfield. According to Collinson (1791): ::\\"When John Wyndham came to the estate, disliking the situation of the house, because it was surrounded with wood, he pulled it down, and with the materials built a farm-house at a little distance, now called Woodhouse, and likewise an alms-house in the village of Ilton. There now remains no part of the ancient edifice, except an old wall on the east side. The seat was formerly moted round, and the buildings exhibited many striking indications of remote antiquity\\". *Silverton in Devon, where his descendant George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786‚Äì1845) built \\"Silverton Park\\" (or \\"Egremont House\\"), a large neoclassical mansion, demolished in 1901.

Formerly run by the Portuguese State, they are now run by the Pestana Group, which in September 2003 won a public bid for the sale of 37.6% of parent company Enatur and for a 40-year running concession. It is a member of the Historic Hotels of Europe. The Pousadas were envisioned and created in the early 1940s by Ant√≥nio Ferro, head of the National Propaganda Secretariat and also a poet and playwright, who had the idea of creating hotels that were both rustic and genuinely Portuguese. His first Pousada was built in Elvas, in the Alentejo, which would be the first of what Ferro called \\"small hotels that look nothing like hotels\\". This Pousada is no longer active. There are now 44 Pousadas installed in historic buildings. The Portuguese word pousada means \\"hostel\\" or \\"inn\\". In Portugal, the use of the word is registered as a trademark and reserved for the use of the Pousadas de Portugal and also of the Pousadas de Juventude (Portuguese state-run youth hostel chain associated to the Hostelling International). A similar small charming, nature or historical hotel in Portugal that is not part of the Pousadas de Portugal chain is classified as estalagem, a word which also means \\"hostel\\" or \\"inn\\". History =Origins= Pousada da Rainha Santa Isabel, Estremoz, installed in a medieval royal palace Created by the Law 31.259 of 1 May 1941, by Ant√≥nio Ferro's initiative. The first hotel was inaugurated in 1942, in Elvas, Alentejo, a region that has several historical pousadas. Other Regional Pousadas were inaugurated, always with a small number of rooms and a special attention to the local gastronomy. In the 1950s, a new designation was added, Historical Pousadas, these hotels were installed in historical monuments and buildings, castles, convents and monasteries. The first Pousada created under this new designation was Pousada do Castelo in √ìbidos. In 1995, the American Society of Travel Agents and the Smithsonian Foundation, awarded the Pousadas de Portugal the annual prize for the institutions around the world with an active part in the protection of cultural and environmental heritage for touristic purposes.Pousadas History =Privatization= In 2003, due to the accumulation of negative results for more than a decade,Enatur Financial Situation the Portuguese Government led by Dur√£o Barroso decided to privatize 49% of Enatur's capital, as well as to concede the management of the Pousadas to the winning group. The winner was the PPG ‚Äì Pestana Pousadas Group, formed by Pestana Group (59.8%), CGD Group (25%), Oriente Foundation (15%) and two more companies with 0.2% (Viagens Abreu and Portimar). On 1 September 2003, PPG became responsible for the management of the Pousadas hotel chain for a period of 20 years.Governo da Rep√∫blica Portuguesa nota sobre a privatiza√ß√£o da Enatur =The future= medieval fortified palace In Portugal, PPG intends to continue the expansion of the hotel chain. Two new Pousadas are planned for 2012, the Pousada de Cascais (on the coast near Lisbon) and the Pousada da Serra da Estrela (in the mountainous central part of the country). The Pousada de Cascais is to be situated in the old citadelle in Cascais to a design by the Gon√ßalo Byrne architects group (also responsible for the Pousadas in Viseu and Faro) and David Sinclair. The Pousada da Serra da Estrela is to be adapted out of the sanatorium for the railway employees by Cottinelli Telmo. Eduardo Souto de Moura, winner of the Pritzker Prize in 2011 is the architect. He was also responsible for the conversion of the Convent of Santa Maria do Bouro into the Pousada de Amares. =Worldwide= In 2005, the first Pousada de Portugal outside of Portugal opened in Brazil, in a historic building and fort built by the Portuguese. Although this is by far the biggest hotel in the chain, in Brazil the term pousada usually refers to a cheaper hotel, more like a bed and breakfast, which may lead to confusion. Under an internationalization plan, the PPG wants to open Pousadas in all the locations that the Portuguese once ruled: Asia (Goa, Macau and even East Timor), Africa (Cape Verde, Mozambique and even Angola) and new places in Brazil. Pousadas hotel chain segmentation The Pousadas are divided in four main groups, according to their architectural specificity, its surroundings or even its concept: *Pousadas Hist√≥ricas (Historic Pousadas), located in well preserved yet unspoiled national monuments, such as convents, monasteries, castles or fortresses; *Pousadas Hist√≥ricas Design (Historic Design Pousadas), also in monuments, castles, convents, fortresses and palaces that were vastly renovated, sporting artistic and contemporary decoration and facilities; *Pousadas Natureza (Nature Pousadas), in natural countryside locations; *Pousadas Charme (Charm Pousadas), located in areas of romantic, unique atmosphere. =Historic Pousadas= Pousada de √ìbidos, installed in the medieval Castle of √ìbidos romantic palace of the late 19th century In historical buildings *Alvito - Pousada de Alvito Historic Hotel *Beja - Pousada de Beja Historic Hotel *Belmonte - Pousada do Convento de Belmonte *Estremoz - Pousada de Estremoz Historic Hotel *√âvora - Pousada de √âvora Historic Hotel *Guimar√£es - Pousada de Guimar√£es - Sta.

The others are Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School and Bosch Bah√° º√≠ School. Louhelen is near Davison, Michigan. The school property was bought for Bah√° º√≠ purposes in 1930 by the new married couple Lou and Helen Eggleston and they hosted a picnic that year. The first \\"school\\" session was held in 1931 and was run via a committee organized by the national community through the 1930s and 40s. Innovations in the period were adding distinct sessions for youth and junior youth and practicum \\"laboratory\\" sessions. All the while the material setting was also advanced. In 1947 the Egglestons donated the school property valued over $50k and the National Spiritual Assembly of the US bought the residence which was organically part of the school. The work of maintaining the site was then kept by two committees and on-site managers though the Egglestons continued to associate with the school into the early 1950s. Lou died in 1953 while their daughter assisted the school in 1955. For a period of two years, however, the school was shut down as were all the Bah√° º√≠ schools, in 1949 and 1950 to conserve resources for the cost of finishing the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette and to clearly establish the thrust of work of promulgating the religion in Latin America. Activities resumed and continued through the 1960s into the early 1970s. However a safety situation developed and in 1974 the school was closed by the national assembly. An investment of $1.8 million followed with plans drawn up and construction projects carried out from 1980 to 1982 and the school re-opened with some buildings restored, others replaced and the mission more explicitly being a residential college and conference center. A number of subject areas have been advanced across the periods of the school. One was race unity, a subject at the school explicitly since 1932 when Maye Gift's talks on race led to a compilation that was well received in multiple reprints. The school welcomed inter-racial couples, members of diverse races, and a project supporting black students going to attend integrating schools in Greenville, SC, in 1964 was undertaken and a socioeconomic development program Understanding Racism initiative in 1986. Books were also developed from other presentations at the school - some of Stanwood Cobb's work was gathered from working for a school session, and the text of The Divine Art of Living evolved from presentations. Moslem and Christian subjects were studied early on. Later a residential college program supported students who stayed at the school and were students in area colleges. Scholars of the religion gathered annually at the school in the form of the Association for Bah√° º√≠ Studies and the Irfan Colloquia and attracted performers like Andy Grammer, and Kevin Locke. The school also supported a grandparents-and-grandkids program of learning indigenous Indian cultural history. Jr youth projects have been posted to YouTube.  Early history  = Pre-history = The Genesee County area was developed by Euro-Americans following the development of an Indiana Territory and its dissolution. Then, the region went through transitions from a territory to a state. Freeman Sweers established the farm near Davison, Michigan in the latter 1800s and sold to a D. P. Hall. In 1924, Sweers bought into a development in Florida. About the time of the Great Depression in the United States and in bad condition, the farm was bought by Lou (Lewis W.) and Helen Eggleston. Lou was born about 1873, worked in heating industry, and then, at about the age of 50, Lou married Helen and bought the farm, then about 268 acres. Helen was daughter of E. D. and Mrs. Whitney, of Lansing.  1930  Helen, still going by her maiden name of Whitney, sent a message to the Bah√° º√≠ News, early monthly periodical of the religion, published in October 1930, of the intention of setting it up as a dairy farm \\"to operate as far as possible along Baha'i lines\\". In the face of the extending troubles of the Depression that year, a \\"picnic\\" was held; it was one of two informal picnics Bah√° º√≠s held in Michigan that year. The name \\"Louhelen\\", a contraction of their first names, was originally used as in \\"Louhelen Ranch\\". Louhelen was also the name of their daughter and they also had a son Lewis Jr. both of which came along later. = Central States Baha'i School in the 1930s =  1931  The July 1931 edition of Bah√° º√≠ News published the announcement of the program at the Central States Bah√° º√≠ Summer School, the first name of the school, August 1‚Äì9 with lodgings and two meals a day for $10-$12 for the week and noted correspondence should be sent to Helen Whitney Eggleston to an address in Detroit. The faculty included Harlan and Grace Ober, already active in the religion many years in the Boston area and Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School, Mabel and Howard Ives, Dorothy Baker, Fanny Knobloch, and Maye Harvey Gift. Mary Collison and Miss McKay were support staff. The Obers and Ives planned the school as a committee. 35 Baha'is and friends from six states attended all the sessions and about 50 others, mainly from Detroit and Flint, came as day students to one or more classes. Baker's entire family attended. The sessions were held that year in a wooded area sloping down to a clear stream, either in a lodge on the hillside or in an open-air amphitheater nearby. Some 20 people attended the first day and about 90 total attended at least one day of activities. The Egglestons devoted themselves to developing the school's facilities. A small barn was partitioned into private rooms and became a Pullman type lodge, providing long narrow rooms. A dining porch was added to the main house to improve the serving of meals. 80 acres of the Eggleston farm were allotted to be used by the school. A ravine was named Ridvan Garden. Details were covered in the two main periodicals of the religion of the day - Bah√° º√≠ News, and Star of the West, the oldest large scale journal of the religion in the US, in December, 1931. Topics of the sessions included economics, the problem of greed and it's amelioration and another was practical and inspirational approaches to being trustworthy. There was also a daily class in public speaking, study of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s talks, a leading figure of the religion, children's classes, and international subjects. Recreational activities in the afternoon included swimming and horse-back riding. The author of the Star of the West article recalled there being a log cabin overlooking the ravine. Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick, a Baha'i since at least 1927, was present at this first session and would long serve the school. Noting the need for a center of activity between the coasts and the progress of the Eggleston and noted some 35 attendees with 90 at least some session. A message from Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, was quoted \\"To achieve success in such manner the first year is certainly beyond what we could expect.\\"  1932  In 1932, the summer school became a recognized Bah√° º√≠ institution. A committee was appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States consisting of Lou Eggleston, Dorothy Baker, and Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick. Subjects and faculty were published ahead of time. The cost for participants was published at $9 to $12 for room with 2 meals per day for nine days and suggesting dinners in nearby Davison. In addition to the school July 31 to August 9, events and meetings happened beyond the school session. A specific inter-community conference took place July 31. Faculty and subjects included Bishop Brown (Bah√° º√≠ administration,) and Mrs. Brown (outline for the study of The Dawn-Breakers,) Pearl Easterbrook (prayer and meditation,) Albert Vail (study of The Dawn-Breakers,) Dorothy Baker (who oversaw a youth meeting of some 18-20 and had many supplemental presentations by other faculty,) Ruth Moffett (the Temple being built, and spiritual illumination,) Maye Harvey Gift (amity work ‚Äì in 1935 Gift would co-produced the first compilation of Baha'i references to race issues, circulated more in 1942 which was revised and republished in expanded form in 1943,  and 1956,* * also owned by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr,) Elizabeth Greenleaf, chair of the new national youth committee (on youth consultation,) as well as some youth. Several of the faculty ‚Äì Vail, Gift, and Easterbrook being leaders from various Illinois communities ‚Äì Urbana and Peoria especially ‚Äì though Vail had already more of a nation visibility and had given up a likely winning career as a unitarian universalist minister and in the case of Easterbook position in the New Thought movement. In addition to Baker's family, Jakob Kunz's daughters attended. A meeting was arranged by local Rev. J. M. Pengelly who became interested from the 1931 meeting where he attended the classes by Harlan Ober. Pengelly also invited Ruth Moffett to address his church group. Average attendance during the school approached 60 (twice the previous year) and filled the accommodations. An additional 10-20 from Detroit attended some days. 18-20 youth attended and some paid their way by service. Dorothy Baker supervised the youth who held their own forum, daily elected a chair from their own group and called for two short talks for each session followed by an open forum limiting the speaker to not comment further. Albert Vail's study of The Dawn-Breakers, included instruction on Muslim history. Also $50 was gathered for donation to the Temple construction following a fundraiser by Orcella Rexford. She had attended at the urging of friends at the last minute and later wrote an article for Star of the West. She recalled driving past the ranch house on the winding driveway with a nine-sided building hosting water resources and staying in one of the new cabins. She noted the Pullman Lodge was two-story and that people had come from as far as California and Maine as well as one who had finished a round-the-world trip. Half the attendees were called youth and looked forward to \\"doing something\\". The closing night the youth presented an original play \\"O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us to see ourself as others see us\\" quoting Robert Burns and imitating various of the elders present. Again the Egglestons looked at improving, adding, and remodeling buildings between this session and the next.  1933  Amidst the closing of banks and tightening money during the early part of the year via the Emergency Banking Act, plans for the summer 1933 moved the school about a month earlier, June 25-July 3. The national assembly specifically asked that the overall program for promoting the religion across the country was to be presented at Louhelen and Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ Schools that year. Dorothy Baker was to lead youth group, and new Pullman Apartments had been added to the barn to accommodate more people. Faculty include Bishop and Mrs. Brown, Allen McDaniel, Harlan and Grace Ober, Elizabeth Greenleaf and Dorothy Baker, Fanny Knobloch, and Lillian Seilken. Three meals a day and room were paid for at between $12.50 to $23 for the whole session, average attendance was about 70 and there were 140 total attendees. Elizabeth Greenleaf opened the session with a presentation on meditation and prayer, then Harlan Ober, assisted by Greenleaf, reviewed Bah√° º√≠ administration as it was understood then - Allen McDaniel was sick. Dorothy Backer gave daily talks from The Dawn- Breakers. Afternoon public meetings attracted a few visitors. Youth did the planning of evening events. Some 26 youth participated in total and included some non-Baha'is. Philip Sprague came late and gave a talk on the progress of the Temple. $500 was raised for it. Ruth Moffett gave a talk. Mary Maxwell, soon to marry Shoghi Effendi and change her name to R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum, also gave two talks based on The Dawn-Breakers. The final advertised program of faculty and topics was: Elizabeth Greenleaf (Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n,) Greenleaf and Harlan Ober (Baha'i Administration,) Dorothy Baker (The Dawn-Breakers,) Ober (religion and society,) Gretch Westervelt (new education,) Orcella Rexford (tomorrow,) Grace Obert (cycle of life,) Fanny Knobloch (Bah√° º√≠ Faith to South Africa,) Harlan Ober (New civilization,) and Baker (cosmic consciousness of unity.)  1934  Planned for June 30 to July 8, the faculty proposed were: Allen B. McDaniel, Mary Hanford Ford, Shahnaz Waite, Gretchen Westervelt, Dorothy Baker, and Philip Sprague. Topics were to include Baha'i administration, The Dawn Breakers, and the Bible. A youth conference of 16 people in Lima, Ohio, gathered from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, at the end of March consulted about Louhelen. They first noted a change in date for the youth session to June 25-8 and faculty and subjects as: devotionals by Dorothy Baker, Bah√° º√≠ ideals in a forum by Harlan Ober, effective leadership by Marion Holley, (Olympian in the 1928 games,) spiritual aspects of the teachings by Mary Hanford Ford, Bible study and comparative religion by James McCormick, and had rates from $5 to $8 for four days, meals, and board. At the time it was the only such session among any of the Baha'i schools. However it happened July 10‚Äì13 instead of late June, and Dorothy Baker returned to lead the session assisted by Philip Sprague. Mary Maxwell and James McCormick also assisted the youth group meeting. The youth group focused on dramatic re- enactments. The general session of nine days was to cost between $12.50 to $18.50. Detroit newspapers noted the gathering at Louhelen as well as the organizing committee including Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick and L. W. Eggleston. They also listed the members of the year's Detroit Assembly including Lou Eggleston as chair and Mrs. Eggleston as corresponding secretary. Sylvia Paine wrote a summary of her experience at the school in the session for the September Star of the West edition. She recounted how two youth visitors looking for riding horses chanced upon the Baha'i school in session and stayed a half hr to hear of the ideas. Paine noted the school conference was 14 days long. Meditation and prayer, narratives of Baha'i history, principles of governance, and there was room for swimming and playing tennis, baseball or horse riding. Piano playing was also to be found as well as sing-alongs. She also noted the youth gathering for four days for the first time, and there was a conscious attempt to vary the faculty. She also states the goals of the schools:: to deepen one's knowledge of the religion, to have an opportunity for Baha'is to meet and find friendships, to inform seekers, and be a testing ground for spirit and precepts meet. A letter from Shoghi Effendi was addressed to that school's session. Presenting the high goals of virtues, he said, \\"\\"the work in which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart and constitutes one of the most vital aspects of the manifold activities of our beloved Faith.\\"  1935  At the spring national convention Dale Cole described a youth group in Flint, MI, founded by the influence of the Louhelen Summer School, who then formed a Spiritual Assembly in 1935. This was also highlighted by the youth committee reported by Marion Holley. The 1935 season was scheduled to begin with a youth session June 24‚Äì27 with faculty and subjects as: Dorothy Baker (Baha'i Life), Bishop Brown (Baha'i approach to world problems), Shoghi Effendi's letters (run by the \\"Young People's Council\\"), What is the Baha'i movement (under the direction of the \\"Council\\"). This was followed by the general session June 29-July 7 with faculty and subjects: Horace Holley, (Baha'i activities,) Stanwood Cobb, (Security in a failing world, based on his 1934 book,) Loulie Matthews (Divine Art of Living, material of which was gathered and published as early as 1940, see Bah√° º√≠ Faith on life after death), and a second general summer session August 19‚Äì24 not announcing faculty yet. An updated program appeared in July outlining the second session with its first faculty Carl Scheffler and E. Lenore Morris. The final faculty announced was: Mrs. Barry Orlova, Stanwood Cobb, Dorothy Baker, Bishop Brown, Horace Holley, and Mamie Seto, a Bah√° º√≠ from Hawaii, with members of the Lansing Bah√° º√≠s attending including George and Mrs. Angell, Cora Reed, Ed and Mrs. Whitney, H. A. and Mrs. Jersey, William and Mrs. Warner, Earl Shetterly, Marie Fox, Bert and Gale Peek, Allen McLean. The Central States Baha'i Summer School Committee sent a letter to Bah√° º√≠ News published in a summer 1935 supplement saying the school will be held June 29 at the request of the national teaching committee and responding to the telegram from Shoghi Effendi and that reservations be sent in as quickly as possible. Marion Holley organized a survey of Bah√° º√≠ youth in America published in 1936 and found that by far the largest mid-western gathering of youth to that date was at the Louhelen in 1935. Another youth meeting was planned to be held in 1936 chaired by Wildrid Barton of Winnetka, IL. The idea of a survey was mentioned in 1934 by the new nationally organized Bah√° º√≠ youth committee,  1936  The youth session for 1936 was planned June 22-5; faculty were advertised as Bahiyyih Lindstrom, Dorothy Baker, and Stanwood Cobb. Some 80 youth attended and listed Glen Shook among the faculty. The Chicago Bah√° º√≠ youth oversaw the sports, afternoon and evening entertainments and they developed their own basic rules of conduct centered on the honor system. Discussions included the attitude towards the growing WWII (then brewing mostly in Europe,) and relationships with ecclesiastical organizations were among the topics. Garreta Busey gave a class on public speaking. The general session followed with faculty Dorothy Baker, Glenn Shook, and Stanwood Cobb. Baker's attendance was in the context of having given up her savings for Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage as a contribution for the Bah√° º√≠ Temple and her talks included her choice in a marriage partner being guided more by prayers than by her attraction to a willing suitor. The densest and largest concentration of Bah√° º√≠ youth in America was in the Midwest from the south of the Urbana-Peoria region north through Chicago to Milwaukee-Kenosha, and across America by far the largest gathering of youth to 1936 was at Louhelen. This was followed by the general session June 28-July 5 including faculty Allen McDaniel, Glenn Shook, and Stanwood Cobb. A second session was added for August 2‚Äì9 with faculty Mamie Seto, Marzeih Carpenter (later Gail), and Willard McKay; two of the classes were on Islam/Islamic culture. The cost advertised for the 4 day youth session was $5, and general sessions per day of $1.35 to $2.10. L. W. Eggleston was still advertised leading the school in the Detroit Free Press. A brief profile and speakers at the school was profiled in the Lansing State Journal. Recognizing the historical character of the development, the relatively new Bah√° º√≠ national archives established under the National Spiritual Assembly called for materials for the summer schools to be preserved. The summer 1936 school at Louhelen was noted as one of the places an \\"inter-community\\" conference was held with a member of every assembly and group in the state present. The second general session had faculty Maime Seto, Marzieh Carpenter, and Willar McKay. Note was taken of newspaper articles by Clarissa Bean of Flint, and in Detroit, if briefly. A public tour of Louhelen by Roscoe Springston, chair of the Detroit assembly, was advertised as well as some sessions available such as by Marzieh Carpenter and other classes offered.  1937  Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick presented at the Bah√° º√≠ national convention about the schools in April. The program committee oversaw all sessions for 1937 with the youth committee delegated for their session. Members of the program committee were L. W. Eggleston chair, and members Bishop Brown, E. J. Miessler, Doroth Baker, Garreta Busey, and Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick served as secretary for the group. The youth committee had members Marguerite Reimer, (soon to be married to William Sears), Florence Mattoon, Wilfrid Barton, (and a youth of Lima, Ohio, to be elected by youth present.) The youth session was advertised running June 27-July 1; faculty advertised were Willard McKay, Annamarie and Margert Kunz, Garretta Busey, Marzeih Carpenter, and 1928 Olympian Marion Holley. Some attended from Buffalo, NY. A youth then non-Bah√° º√≠ in California later wrote of her experience coming to the religion after being much impressed by a faculty of the Louhelen 1937 session as an article in 1942's World Order magazine. The first general session then ran July 3‚Äì11 with faculty Allen McDaniel, Marzieh Carpenter, Garetta Busey, and Marion Holly. A class on publicity was done at Louhelen in July 1937 by Mrs. Wendell E. Bacon and draft articles accomplished in the class were sent to area newspapers and Lou Eggleston himself published a long article on the history of the Louhelen school in the Davison newspaper. The second general session ran July 31-August 8 with faculty N. M. Firoozi, Glen Shook, and Dorothy Baker. Room and board for general sessions per day per person ran $1.50 to $2.15. Lothar Shurgast, former spy for Germany, also came as faculty in August. Some Binghamton, NY, Bah√° º√≠s were noted attending Louhelen this August session.  1938  In April 1938 the national library committee reported in Bah√° º√≠ News that it had contributed books to the Bah√° º√≠ school libraries including Louhelen. Meetings on race unity were held in lead up to the general session. Emogene Hoagg gave study classes in the Flint community staying at Louhelen since May, and was among many faculty that year who spoke in neighboring towns - Carl Scheffler, Robert Faines, McDaniel, Harlan Ober and Caswell all gave extra talks in the area. The first general session August 6‚Äì13 had faculty Curtis Kelsey, Helen Bishop, Alice Bacon, Marzieh Carpenter, with costs between $1.50 and $2.15 per day. The youth session ran at $1.20 per day for August 16‚Äì20 with faculty Virginia Camelon, Edward Miessler, Helen Bishop, Carl Scheffler and Marzieh Carpenter. An article noted some from Lansing attending: Frank and Mrs. Evans, Grace Coltrin, Alverta Hamilton, George H and Mrs. Angell, Charity Ballard, Cora Reed, David and Mrs. Earl. Mrs. Earl was Joy Hill Earl, an African American, while David M. Earl was white. Thus the campus hosted an inter-racial black- white couple in 1938. A talk from faculty and attendees also followed a school session. A change in 1938 was an added youth session and changed one of the general sessions into a laboratory session as suggested by Marion Holley. The laboratory session was added to allow students to concentrate on special projects; in 1938 it was a study project of 10 days by H. Imogene Hoagg, and a project to reach out to neighboring communities with literature and conversations, coordinately by Margarite Reimer. Cobb's lectures developed for Louhelen classes in recent years were presented as a series of articles in World Order magazine across 1938 and collected and printed as a book as well.* : See :   1939  Having books donated the previous year there was need for a library building, and it was erected and called the Refuge in 1939, through financial support of Amelia Collins and Dorothy Graf. It was raised with labor donated by Lou and George Eggleston. The first session in the summer of 1939 was a general session August 6‚Äì13 with faculty Curtis Kelsey, Helen Bishop, Alice Bacon, and Marzieh Carpenter; the second youth session ran from August 16‚Äì20 with faculty Virginia Camelon, Edward Miessler, Helen Bishop, Carl Scheffler, and Marzeih Carpenter, at $1.20 per day. The endeavor of the school was encouraged and commented on via a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Louhelen School on July 29.

Michael Jamir, Paul Becker, and Firuz Kazemzadeh taught classes of the junior youth and youth session. Dorothy Beecher Baker spoke at the last session of the summer. People attended from Lansing, and from Florida. The first \\"homecoming\\" was planned for Sep 4-5 of Louhelen alumni. Very likely more than 150 people attended at least for some hrs. The attendees asked the school committee to make it a regular part of the summer program. It was now considered a tradition to begin each day of the session with prayer and meditation. The first program was a concert and then three periods of discussion followed. One was led by Donald Corbin on the history and growth of the administration including a play written by Ruhiyyih Khanum. The next was by Ellsworth Blackwell, his second appearance on campus, on \\"the challenging requirement\\". And the last was by Mrs. George A. True, chair of the program committee, with a panel including Edwin Earldley who was chair of the Louhelen maintenance committee reviewing a deep history of the school and operational procedures. A costume party was held the next day with a picnic supper at \\"the Glen\\". Alumni sent letters from Switzerland, Brazil, and Japan and audio wire recording were presented - a talk on The Seven Valleys, another to accompany a slide presentation, and from the convention talk about Louhelen. Five alumni Latin American pioneers were also present. A letter of pioneers to Puerto Rico was intended for the Louhelen \\"homecoming\\" for alumni arrived too late but was published in Bah√° º√≠ News. It was the first year without the founders directly involved with maintenance and conducting functions now taken on by committees. Arnold Ketels was the resident director, and the broad organization of the sessions hed been set by Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick, now 70 yrs old, though she died in May from a car crash. Others from Olivet, MI, attended. The 1948-9 committee was Marguerite True, chair, Helen Eggleston, corresponding secretary, Robert Gaines recording secretary, Bertha Hyde Kirkpatrick, Mrs Clinton Wideman, Arnold Ketels, Paul Pettit, Mrs. Addie Miller, and Phyllis Hall. The winter session was advertised, and had Larry Kramer, Alice Bacon, and Elsworth Blackwell as faculty and the Feast of Honor was held in the Eggleston home.  1949-1950  A tentative summary of the 1949 program was published in December 1948 with a teachers training session, two junior youth sessions, a senior youth session, young adult and adult sessions. The plans advanced for the summer 1949 plan as of January. However a period of austerity was imposed for 1949 and 1950 by Shoghi Effendi wherein the summer sessions would not take place at any of the three main Bah√° º√≠ schools in order to provide the means to finish the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois) for its opening and the priority of the pioneering work in Latin America. Major maintenance was undertaken at the time adding the septic system. A maintenance committee report for 1949-50, composed of Stanley Bagley, chair, Beatrice Earley, secretary, Edwin Eardley, Clinton Wideman, Oscar Ketels and J. Murdoch Eaton, reported that like all Baha'i schools the summer sessions have been closed for 2 years; an inventory process was ongoing and a tenant has been set up in the Eggleston house leased at $75/mth, and the upper floor of the library rented for $400 for four months. In the fall of 1950 Paul Pettit was mentioned on school committee of Louhelen.  1951  After having met the goal of the Temple construction funding, Shoghi Effendi and the national assembly re-opened the three schools for the summer of 1951. A tentative program was announced in March, and finalized in April, as follows: Junior youth session 1 ran July 1‚Äì6 had faculty Edna Ketels, Laura and Robert Markovich, and Eulie Horne. Junior youth session 2, July 8‚Äì13, had faculty Eunice and John Schurcliff, Wima Ridley and Ella Eaton. General session 1 July 15‚Äì20 with faculty Harry Jay, Florence Reeb, and Elizabeth Cheney.

There would be a homecoming session September 2‚Äì3 scheduled to be run by Paul Pettit, Michael Jamir, and the Lansing Baha'i community. The maintenance and program committees for Louhelen met at the Bagley home in Flint in March. A significant decision was to offer child care for children 4 yrs old or older for parents attending sessions at a discount from the regular rates - probably half the regular cost. As all the sessions were centered on published texts, individuals were encouraged to bring their own copies but could buy then at the school - to facilitate the aim of \\"a profound study of the Faith, and not mere wide, but superficial, surveys.\\" The maintenance committee was hoping to provide hot water showers for the first time, and was looking for volunteers to help clean up before the sessions. Clinton and Mrs Wideman served as joint managers of the school. Among those who presented about the African focus of pioneering were Robert Wolff, Ernest Welsing, Larry Hautz, Matthew Bullock, Ellsworth Blackwell, and John Robarts. Baha'is attended for Port Huron, MI, and talks about one or another of the faculty were covered in one or another newspaper. The Homecoming event included Bah√° º√≠s from Lansing - Richard and Mrs. Nolen, William H and Mrs. Smith, Sophia Butterfield, Calvin Tillman, Gordon and Mrs. Fraser, and Fauna Taylor. A letter from the national assembly summarized the 1951 summer season - an attendance of 360 people, $600 worth of Baha'i literature sold, a total income of $3922 and costs of $3241 during the school though these did not cover advance costs and insurance. Two letters on behalf of Shoghi Effendi were written to youth sessions and were published in March 1952, and reinterated in December. Another letter was published in 1998 from that summer school session as well. Vera Esinhart attended Louhelen supporting the nursery. For the Fall of 1951 the committee of Ernest and Mrs. Benner, Mrs. Bruce Thomas, Mrs. Charlie Lenk, Mrs. O. J. Ketels and daughter Maxine, and Elizabeth Knill, gathered to plan for the next season's cycle of presentations. Vera D. Esinhart was back to work in the nursery. Faculty include Mrs. Bagley, and her husband Stanley. The 1951-2 winter school had a session December 23-5 on effective study of Baha'i scriptures, and another was held December 28 - January 1 with three topics - early history, coming history, and living in the present. Grethen Westervelt was the guest of O J and Mrs. Ketels.  Egglestons  In the Spring of 1951 Louhelen Eggleston had attended from Western Michigan University,(WMU) where she worked on the campus Herald newspaper. Lou Eggleston was profiled in the local news late in 1951. and again in March 1952. Lou died the next year. September 11, 1953 a telegram was sent on news of the death of Eggleston.

The winter session was published in December aimed at the topic of the World Crusade with Rebecca Wideman as registrar. Mrs Dudley Blakely taught in the winter session.  1954  Mrs. Marvin Nochman of WSU was among the early faculty advertised for the 1954 season, and the program committee of Laura Post, Helen Eggleston, Lestor Long, and William Lacey was announced. The declared priority of the 1954 season was for the Ten Year Crusade with a line of action on children on the religion, arts and crafts, and recreation, so that parents could attend sessions, and a daily introduction to the religion was set for any speakers; all from July 5 to Sep 3. Ona Koppe shared events when she returned to Obio,. while local coverage in Port Huron mentioned Laurence Hautz giving a talk with color slides. Quentin Farrand from Lansing also spoke. while a Bah√° º√≠ attended Magengo, IL. Weekly meetings were established approaching mid-August and Lois Nochman gave a talk. A larger group of Bah√° º√≠s from Hamburg, NY, attended: James B. and Mrs. McCloskey, sons of Eugene and Mrs. Thorpe - Keith and David - Harry and Mrs. Pringle and daughter Bonnie, Nemat Borhani, Marion Joseph, Hbarjan Hayre, George Peng, and John Holby. Ellsworth Blackwell both represented the NAACP and the Baha'i Faith at a presentation. In the summer of 1954 newly designated Auxiliary Board member Margery McCormick visited among Michigan and other state travels, along with William deForge. The first state wide convention of Bah√° º√≠s held at Louhelen attracted 160 attendees in early December. The following winter session was set to review the Crusade, the Guardianship, and Some Answered Questions. with faculty Edith McLaren, Bert Rakowski, and Marjorie McCormick.  1955  The program for the summer 1955 season was published in May. It started with a Central States area teaching conference July 2‚Äì4, followed immediately by a junior youth session July 5‚Äì15, and then an institute for child education July 16‚Äì17. A general family session was set July 18‚Äì29, then a two day session on Islam, a second general family session August 1‚Äì5, and a 2 day session on Israel.

That winter Grace von der Heydt came from SC. Louhelen Eggleston, daughter of Lou and Helen, joined the committee late early in 1955. The February 1955 issue of Bah√° º√≠ News presented a call for new teachers and courses. That year Dempsey and Adrienne Morgan joined the religion while they attended a session. That spring Louhelen hosted a multi-faith panel of Wayne State students - Mulsim, Hindu and Buddhist - while Jane Faily presented about the Baha'is. Bah√° º√≠s attended from Port Huron, MI, and Mattoon, IL. Joseph Zabelski, Ruth Moffett, and Hamilton Niss were among the faculty. The summer season had more than 200 attended the summer sessions and their names sent back to their area assemblies to aide promoting activities in their home areas. Auxiliary Board member William deForge attended as well. Lynn Markovich Bryant recalled attending in 1956 as well. Enthusiasm of a youth conference led to another in November. 1955-6 winter session was announced, and included a talk by Sam Clark of the board of Louhelen.  1956  As of January 1 the school was renamed \\"Davison Baha'i School\\". The 25th summer session of the school was held in 1956 and a brief program outline was published in March.

Ground breaking began September 1, 1980, hoping to re-open in 1981 for its 50th anniversary. The Library was to be repurposed as an archives, the former auditorium would become a storage building and the main original buildings would be restored to the 1930s form. The Pullman dormitory and four cottages would be demolished. The new buildings would include a lodge center with kitchen, lounge, bookstore, and admin offices. A new classroom building would have 5 classrooms with their own external patio, an arts/crafts room, and a nursery. Housing would be provides with 24 suites with space for 130 people.

Others attended from Port Huron,. In 1982 final construction was proceeding. The experience at Louhelen was used in a 1984 renovation of the Baha'i Temple by Frederick McCoy. Some 1000 Baha'is attended the grand re-opening of the renovated Louhelen school in October 1982, also attended by Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem, members of the National Assembly and various committees.

The renovation project cost $1.9 million and started Sep 6, 1981. The campus had been closed in 1974 because the buildings had reached an unsafe condition, and then after a two year program of raising money with a Faizi Endowment, created in memory of Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Qasim Faizi for the renovation it began. ‚Ä¶ The school was reformed into a place centered as a conference and retreat center and William Diehl came as its director but specifically set aside a school function - a residential college associated with nearby colleges - UoM@Flint or the local community college and at the time maintained a teaching position at the UoM@F. The first event at the school was a youth conference, the Midwestern Regional Conference of the Association for Baha'i Studies, in November 1982. The local Davison Index noted the construction as well: \\"New construction and renovation of older building is nearly complete at Louhelen Baha'i School on South State Road in Davison Township. The new school will bring an expected 7,000 members of the Baha'i faith to the Davison area for conference classes and retreats.\\" In 1983, the National Spiritual Assembly opened the buildings which currently comprise Louhelen. This included restoring the original residence to its 1930s form.

About 30 couples, five single people, and 35 children, 45 of whom were Canadian, filled the campus to capacity. Follow-up studies would follow the couples at 6 mths and a year after the institute. In 1984 Louhelen hosted a conference of youth followed by a conference called by the national assembly in May bringing together members of the Continental Counselors Farzam Arbab, Sarah Martin Pereira, Fred Schechter, and Velma Sherril, working on the Campaign for unified action. A socio- economic development project counted in a survey of projects under the initiative of the Universal House of Justice from 1983 was established in the summer of 1984 at Louhelen. It was called the Center for Interracial Understanding by some Michigan Baha'is with expertise in race relations, education and business. Another project called a residential college program, was founded at Louhelen in September 1985, and was part of its conception. It was announced in March 1986 it was accepting applications for the September 1986 enrollment combining formal study of the religion with a degree earning study at one or two nearby colleges. Students would live and work at the school, receive training, and go to one of these schools. In 1985 a symposium was held at Louhelen named We are the world after the song.

He played professionally in the American Soccer League and Major Indoor Soccer League and was the 1981 American Soccer League Rookie of the Year. Youth Suarez was born in Havana, Cuba. In 1972 his parents, Roberto and Miriam Suarez, left Cuba and relocated their family in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Suarez attended Myers Park High School. He graduated from Myers Park in 1974, enrolled in Appalachian State University, then transferred to Belmont Abbey College, where he received a B.A. in Business Management. Professional Suarez had an unsuccessful initial tryout for the Carolina Lightnin' of the American Soccer League. He was put in the lineup for the team's second game; however, after a series of injuries decimated the roster. He was an immediate hit with the crowd who embraced him as \\"a hometown kid.\\" Suarez became known for his \\"toothy grin and shoulder- length hair,\\" according to Charlotte Observer sports reporter David Scott. Suarez scored nine goals in his first 12 games and ended his first season with 15 goals. Suarez' style, according to Scott, was to \\"knock the ball past defenders, run it down, then put it in the back of the net. Or he would chase down a pass behind the defense, slip the ball into the goal and race off to celebrate.\\" He was named the 1981 American Soccer League Rookie of the Year.The Year in American Soccer - 1981 On August 11, 1981, he signed a two- year joint contract with the Lightnin' and the Cleveland Force of the Major Indoor Soccer League worth just over $100,000. The contract stipulated that Suarez would play two outdoor seasons for the Lightnin' and two indoor winter seasons on loan to the Force.Lightnin' Sign Suarez to Six Figure Contract Suarez began the 1981-1982 MISL season in good form, scoring four goals in eight games only to injure his left knee in late 1981. He sat out the 1982 outdoor season, then rejoined the Lightnin' for that team's final season in 1983. While playing with the Charlotte Gold of the United Soccer League in 1984, Suarez injured his right knee, ending his professional career. Drug arrest Suarez regained the public spotlight in 1991 when he received a 22-month prison sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. At the time, he said he hoped youth would learn a lesson from his mistakes.

The Project is a joint venture between the Transport for London and the London Borough of Sutton, with support from the Mayor of London. Schedule Phase one, which ran between September and October 2006 covered the Worcester Park region. The next phase will cover the entire London borough of Sutton and will run from April to September 2007. Similar schemes will be run in other London Boroughs, such as Camden. Methods =Personalised Travel Planning= Following a letter informing residents of the project, teams of Travel Advisors trained in the borough's transport infrastructure will visit every household in the borough aiming to discuss one-to-one with the residents their travel habits and main modes of transport. They will then talk with them about possible alternatives they may not have considered, which may suit them better, save them time, money or hassle, or be more sustainable and less congested. They can supply them with information and incentives which can inform them about local transport, amenities and organizations, and assist and encourage them to more comfortably make changes to the way they travel. =Business & Schools Travel Planning= Travel Advisors will also be visiting businesses and schools to advise them on what they could do to assist their employees and students in changing their travel, for example allowing flexible hours so the rush-hour can be avoided. Grants will also be made available for minor engineering projects for example, shower facilities or secure bicycle storage to encourage traveling by bike. =Feedback= Participants will be given the opportunity to voice their views on Sutton's transport in order for the borough to gauge public opinion and the issues the public think need to be addressed. Resources A wide range of information is available to be freely delivered to residents, this includes‚Ä¶ =Cycling= *TFL guides to cycling and planning cycle journeys in the local area. *Special offers on personal Cycle training. *Information on the Immobilize bike security scheme. =Walking= *Pocket Maps on walking routes in the local area *Information on walking for leisure in the local area, The Chalk Downloads, The Wandle Trail and The London Loop =Public Transport= *Multi-modal pocket maps of Local public Transport links *Oyster Card information *Network Rail Card information *Cabwise taxi cab safety scheme details *Timetables *Tube Maps =Other= *Greener Driving ‚Äì information on saving petrol with more efficient driving techniques *Details home shopping delivery *Information about the Whizzgo car club *Information on climate change *Details on Green spaces to visit in Sutton *Information on accessibility on Sutton's public transport system The requested information is delivered personally to the householders by Bicycle Courier.

As such, it is a multi-core system on a chip. MPSoCs usually targeted for embedded applications. It is used by platforms that contain multiple, usually heterogeneous, processing elements with specific functionalities reflecting the need of the expected application domain, a memory hierarchy and I/O components. All these components are linked to each other by an on-chip interconnect, such as buses and Networks on chip (NoCs). These architectures meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures, network security and other application domains while limiting the power consumption through the use of specialised processing elements and architecture.  Structure  A multiprocessor system on a chip must by definition have multiple processor cores. MPSoCs often contain multiple logically distinct processor modules as well. Additionally, MPSoCs typically contain: * Memory blocks, often using scratchpad RAM and direct memory access *timing sources to generate clock signals to control execution of SoC functions crystal oscillators and phase- locked loops are popular clock generators. * peripherals including counters and power-on reset generators * external interfaces, typically for communication protocols  These are often based upon industry standards such as USB, FireWire, Ethernet, USART, SPI, HDMI, I¬≤C, etc.  each interface is typically to one given core or logical unit on the MPSoC *a network on a chip (NoC) to communicate and share data between the processors and functional units of the MPSoC  Applications  MPSoCs are used when microcontrollers or systems-on-chip must have multiprocessing capabilities. This can include smartphone devices, embedded systems, digital signal processors and other various applications.

The Duke of Yansheng, literally \\"Honorable Overflowing with Sagacity\\", sometimes translated as Holy Duke of Yen, was a Chinese title of nobility. It was originally created as a marquis title in the Western Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì AD 9) for a direct descendant of Confucius. From the Western Han dynasty to the mid-Northern Song dynasty (960‚Äì1127), the title underwent several changes in its name, before it was finally settled as \\"Duke Yansheng\\" in 1005 by Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty. Kong Zongyuan, a 46th-generation descendant of Confucius, became the first person to hold the title \\"Duke Yansheng\\". The dukes enjoyed privileges that other nobles were denied, such as the right to tax their domain in Qufu while being exempt from imperial taxes. Their dukedom had its own judicial system and the legal capacity to mete out capital punishment, although such sentences had to be ratified by the imperial court. In 1935, the Nationalist government of the Republic of China converted the Duke Yansheng title to a political office, \\"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan\\" (), which simply means \\"Ceremonial Official to Confucius\\". This political office is not only hereditary, but also had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the government of the Republic of China. In 2008, with permission from the Kong family, the political office became an unpaid one which is purely ceremonial in nature. It is currently held by Kung Tsui-chang, a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius. There are also similar political offices for the descendants of the other notable members of the Confucian school (the Four Sages), such as \\"Ceremonial Official to Mencius\\", \\"Ceremonial Official to Zengzi\\", and \\"Ceremonial Official to Yan Hui\\".http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htmhttp://blog.xuite.net/ahhsiang/TYDA/20446373-„ÄêÊñáÂè≤ÈõúË®ò„ÄëÂ§ßÊàêËá≥ËÅñÂÖàÂ∏´Â•âÁ•ÄÂÆò In the reformation of the law in 2009, \\"Ceremonial Official to Mencius\\" and \\"Ceremonial Official to Zengzi\\" would become unpaid honorable titles as well once the incumbent officials decease.

He was a descendant of the royal family of the Shang dynasty (c. 1558‚Äì1046 BC) through the dukes of the State of Song (11th century ‚Äì 286 BC). =Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC) and the Western and Eastern Han dynasties (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD)= During the reign of Qin Shi Huang (r. 247‚Äì210 BC), the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty, Kong Fu (), a ninth-generation descendant of Confucius, was awarded the title \\"Lord Wentong of Lu\\" () and the appointment of shaofu (). In 190 BC, Emperor Gao of the Han dynasty awarded the title \\"Lord Fengsi\\" (Â•âÁ•ÄÂêõ; \\"Ceremonial Officer\\") to Kong Teng (), Kong Fu's younger brother. During the reign of Emperor Yuan (r. 48‚Äì33 BC), Kong Ba (), a 13th-generation descendant of Confucius, was granted the title \\"Lord Baocheng\\" (). In addition, the income gained from the 800 taxable households in Kong Ba's fief were used to finance the worshipping of Confucius. Kong Ba also instructed his eldest son, Kong Fu (), to return to their ancestral home to serve as a ceremonial official to their ancestor. The title \\"Marquis Yinshaojia\\" () was conferred on Kong Ji (), a 14th-generation di descendant of Confucius, by Emperor Cheng (r. 33‚Äì7 BC). The emperor also allowed Kong Ji to perform ritual sacrifices to Cheng Tang, the first king of the Shang dynasty, and granted him the er wang san ke () ceremonial privilege. During the reign of Emperor Ping (r. 1 BC ‚Äì 6 AD), granted the title \\"Marquis Baocheng\\" () to Kong Jun (), a 16th-generation descendant of Confucius. Emperor Ming (r. 58‚Äì75 AD) awarded Kong Juan (), an 18th-generation descendant of Confucius, the title \\"Marquis of Bao Village\\" (). Emperor An (r. 106‚Äì125 AD) gave the title \\"Marquis of Fengsheng Village\\" () to Kong Yao (), a 19th-generation descendant of Confucius. The title of Duke of Song and \\"Duke Who Continues and Honours the Yin\\" (ÊÆ∑Á¥πÂòâÂÖ¨) were bestowed upon Kong An (Â≠îÂÆâ (Êù±Êº¢) by the Eastern Han dynasty because he was part of the Shang dynasty's legacy.„ÄäÊ±â‰π¶¬∑Êù®ËÉ°Êú±Ê¢Ö‰∫ë‰º†„ÄãÔºöÂàùÔºåÊ≠¶Â∏ùÊó∂ÔºåÂßãÂ∞ÅÂë®ÂêéÂß¨Âòâ‰∏∫Âë®Â≠êÂçóÂêõÔºåËá≥ÂÖÉÂ∏ùÊó∂ÔºåÂ∞äÂë®Â≠êÂçóÂêõ‰∏∫Âë®Êâø‰ºë‰æØÔºå‰ΩçÊ¨°ËØ∏‰æØÁéã„ÄÇ‰ΩøËØ∏Â§ßÂ§´ÂçöÂ£´Ê±ÇÊÆ∑ÂêéÔºåÂàÜÊï£‰∏∫ÂçÅ‰ΩôÂßìÔºåÈÉ°ÂõΩÂæÄÂæÄÂæóÂÖ∂Â§ßÂÆ∂ÔºåÊé®Ê±ÇÂ≠êÂ≠ôÔºåÁªù‰∏çËÉΩÁ∫™„ÄÇÊó∂ÔºåÂå°Ë°°ËÆÆÔºå‰ª•‰∏∫‚ÄúÁéãËÄÖÂ≠ò‰∫åÁéãÂêéÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•Â∞äÂÖ∂ÂÖàÁéãËÄåÈÄö‰∏âÁªü‰πü„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÁäØËØõÁªù‰πãÁΩ™ËÄÖÁªùÔºåËÄåÊõ¥Â∞Å‰ªñ‰∫≤‰∏∫ÂßãÂ∞ÅÂêõÔºå‰∏äÊâøÂÖ∂ÁéãËÄÖ‰πãÂßãÁ•ñ„ÄÇ„ÄäÊò•Áßã„Äã‰πã‰πâÔºåËØ∏‰æØ‰∏çËÉΩÂÆàÂÖ∂Á§æÁ®∑ËÄÖÁªù„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÆãÂõΩÂ∑≤‰∏çÂÆàÂÖ∂ÁªüËÄåÂ§±ÂõΩÁü£ÔºåÂàôÂÆúÊõ¥Á´ãÊÆ∑Âêé‰∏∫ÂßãÂ∞ÅÂêõÔºåËÄå‰∏äÊâøÊ±§ÁªüÔºåÈùûÂΩìÁªßÂÆã‰πãÁªù‰æØ‰πüÔºåÂÆúÊòéÂæóÊÆ∑ÂêéËÄåÂ∑≤„ÄÇ‰ªä‰πãÊïÖÂÆãÔºåÊé®Ê±ÇÂÖ∂Â´°Ôºå‰πÖËøú‰∏çÂèØÂæóÔºõËôΩÂæóÂÖ∂Â´°ÔºåÂ´°‰πãÂÖàÂ∑≤ÁªùÔºå‰∏çÂΩìÂæóÁ´ã„ÄÇ„ÄäÁ§ºËÆ∞„ÄãÂ≠îÂ≠êÊõ∞Ôºö‚Äò‰∏òÔºåÊÆ∑‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ‚ÄôÂÖàÂ∏àÊâÄÂÖ±‰º†ÔºåÂÆú‰ª•Â≠îÂ≠ê‰∏ñ‰∏∫Ê±§Âêé„ÄÇ‚Äù‰∏ä‰ª•ÂÖ∂ËØ≠‰∏çÁªèÔºåÈÅÇËßÅÂØù„ÄÇ This branch of the Confucius family was a separate branch from the line that held the title of Marquis of Fengsheng village and later Duke Yansheng. This practice was referred to as ‰∫åÁéã‰∏âÊÅ™. =Three Kingdoms period (220‚Äì280 AD) through Northern and Southern dynasties era (420‚Äì589)= During the Three Kingdoms period, the state of Cao Wei (220‚Äì265) renamed the title \\"Marquis Baocheng\\" () to \\"Marquis Zongsheng\\" (). The Jin (265‚Äì420) and Liu Song (420‚Äì479) dynasties changed the title to \\"Marquis of Fengsheng Village\\" (). The Northern Wei dynasty (386‚Äì535) changed the title to \\"Marquis Chongsheng\\" () while the Northern Qi dynasty (550‚Äì577) called it \\"Marquis Gongsheng\\" (). Under the Northern Zhou dynasty (557‚Äì581), the title was promoted from a marquis title to a ducal title, \\"Duke of Zou\\" (). A fief of 100 households and the rank of Â¥áËÅñ‰æØ Marquis who worships the sage was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui's lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius's lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of Â¥áËÅñÂ§ßÂ§´ Grandee who venerates the sage was bestowed on Â≠î‰πò Kong Sheng who was Confucius's scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. =Sui (581‚Äì618) and Tang (618‚Äì907) dynasties= In the Sui dynasty, Emperor Wen (r. 581‚Äì604) awarded the title \\"Duke of Zou\\" () to Confucius's descendants, but Emperor Yang (r. 604‚Äì618) downgraded and renamed the title to \\"Marquis Shaosheng\\" (). During the early Tang dynasty, the title was renamed to \\"Marquis Baosheng\\" (). In the Kaiyuan era (713‚Äì741) of the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the emperor posthumously honoured Confucius as \\"Prince Wenxuan\\" () and promoted the \\"Marquis Baosheng\\" title to \\"Duke Wenxuan\\" (). Duke Wenxuan Kong Renyu lived during the Later Tang dynasty. A line in the Book of Rites had an interpretation written by Kong Yingda. Kong Yingda wrote some interpretations on the Record of Music. Á¶ÆË®òÊ≠£Áæ© was compiled by Kong Yingda. Kong Yingda wrote a new edition of the Shijing. Confucius' scion in the 32nd generation Kong Yingda wrote interpretations of the Confucian 5 Classics called the ‰∫îÁ∂ìÊ≠£Áæ© Wujing zhengyi. A description was written by Kong Yingda on the Di sacrifice. Zhaomu were also mentioned by Kong. =Northern and Southern Song dynasties (960‚Äì1279)= In 1055, Emperor Renzong, changed the \\"Duke Wenxuan\\" title to \\"Duke Yansheng\\" () to avoid naming taboo associated with the posthumous names of the earlier emperors. The title \\"Duke Yansheng\\" was then awarded to Kong Zongyuan (), a 46th-generation descendant of Confucius. It was later changed to \\"Duke Fengsheng\\" () but was quickly restored back to \\"Duke Yansheng\\", and has since then been known as \\"Duke Yansheng\\". During the wars between the Song dynasty and Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234), the Song capital, Kaifeng, was conquered by Jin forces in 1127. Remnants of the Song dynasty retreated south and established the Southern Song dynasty, with Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127‚Äì1162) as their ruler. Kong Duanyou (), who then held the Duke Yansheng title, also moved to the south and settled in Quzhou, Zhejiang, where the southern branch of Confucius's descendants was created. Kong Duancao (), Kong Duanyou's brother, remained in Qufu, Shandong, where he called himself the \\"acting Duke Yansheng\\". Later on, the Jin dynasty recognised Kong Duancao's legitimacy. This resulted in a north‚Äìsouth split among the descendants of Confucius. Historians regarded the southern branch as the di (legitimate) successor to Confucius's line, while the northern branch is seen as a shu (offshoot) branch. The Kongs in Qufu had a genealogy compiled during the Northern Song which described disciples with Confucius images. A pavilion was built by the Jin in the 1190s in the Confucius temple of Qufu over a Song dynasty era dais constructed in 1022. The dias built by the Song and modified by the Jin was depicted in the 1242 genealogy written by Kong Yuancuo. The genealogy written by Kong Yuancuo contains Kong Chuan's Á•ñÂ∫≠Âª£Ë®ò Zuting zaji with Â≠îÁìå Kong Gui's (scion in the 49th generation) introduction. shows pictures of the Song and Jin dynasty era temple of Confucius. Quzhou was where the Gaozong followers from the Kong family evacuated to. The Quzhou temple is home to a rubbed Confucius portrait while the Qufu one has a tablet amade out of stone with a rubbed portrait of Yan Hui and Confcuius while the Qufu temple has another Confucius icon. Â≠îÊ∏ÖË¶∫ Kong Qingjue led a White Cloud ÁôΩÈõ≤ÂÆó group. In 1134 Êù±ÂÆ∂ÈõúË®ò Dongjia zaji was written by Â≠îÂÇ≥ Kong Chuan. In the temple in Qufu an image on a stele was set up by the scion in the 48th generation Kong Duanyou. The temple contained the smalle portrait of Yan Hui and Confucius as recorded by Kong Zonghan. A cadet branch scion in the 49th generation Â≠îÁëÄ Kong Yu in 118 patronized the construction of the portrait on a second stele. Â≠îÂÆóÂ£Ω Kong Zong scio, a scion in the 46th generation in 1096 in the temple in Qufu installed a tablet depicting a portrait of 10 disciples with Confucius which Kong Zonghan mentioned. The portrait was included in the genealogy of Kong Yuancuo. Another image was not redrawn by Kong Yuancuo by was mentioned by Kong Zongyuan, which showed all 72 disciples with Confucius. In the Quzhou temple Kong Chuan and Kong Duanyou patronized the creation of a Confucius image. 46th generation descendant Â≠îÂÆóÁø∞ Kong Zonghan wrote in 1085 a new genealogy. Confucius portraits were spread around in Qufu by Confucius's scions. A genealogy was written in 1085 by Kong Zonghan which described disciples and Confucius images. The genealogy of Kong Yuancuo contained one of the images which also appeared in the temple in Qufu and according to Kong Chuan it was drawn by Qu Daozi. Â≠îÊ∞èÁ•ñÂ∫≠Âª£Ë®ò was compiled by Â≠îÂÖÉÊé™ Kong Yuancuo. Kong Chuan's genealogy was succeeded in 1242 the publishing of the 1227 genealogy written by the Jin dynasty Duke Yansheng of the 51st generation Â≠îÂÖÉÊé™ Kong Yuancuo. The Quzhou-based scion in the 53rd generation during the Yuan dynasty Â≠îÊøÇ Kong Lian wrote commentary on a stele at Quzhou which said that Kong Chuan and his nephew Kong Duanyou created a stone carved image of Confucius. =Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368)= From 1127 up to the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs ‚Äì one in Quzhou, Zhejiang (in the south) and the other in Qufu, Shandong (in the north). In 1233, √ñgedei Khan (r. 1229‚Äì1241) granted the Duke Yansheng title to Kong Yuancuo (), a 51st-generation descendant of Confucius from the northern branch. Kublai Khan (r. 1260‚Äì1294) originally wanted to merge the two Duke Yanshengs under the southern one by making Kong Zhu (), the southern branch's leader, the legitimate successor to the Duke Yansheng line. However, since Kong Zhu declined the offer, Kublai Khan abolished the southern Duke Yansheng title and appointed Kong Zhu as the () of the Imperial Academy. Since then, the northern branch has remained as the \\"legitimate\\" heir to the Duke Yansheng line. p. 14.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248653434_The_Ritual_Formation_of_Confucian_Orthodoxy_and_the_Descendants_of_the_Sage p. 572.

The Southern Branch of the Confucius family at Quzhou During the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius' descendants, who claimed to be one of the Duke Yansheng Kong Huan's Â≠îÊµ£ sons, named Kong Shao Â≠îÁ¥π, moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after wedding a Korean woman (Jo Jin- gyeong's ÊõπÊôâÊÖ∂ daughter) during Toghon Tem√ºr's rule.

The appointment was equivalent to that of an eighth-grade official in the Ming imperial administration. Kong Yansheng's descendants were allowed to inherit the title \\"Wujing Boshi\\".

Kong Luhua (relative of the Duke Yansheng) was the second wife of Ruan Yuan. Headgear was worn by Kong Lingyi in an official portrait. =Republic of China (1912‚Äìpresent)= After the 1911 Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, most of the nobility titles used in the imperial era were abolished. The Duke Yansheng title, however, was an exception along with the Marquis of Extended Grace and the descendants of Mencius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui. During the revolution, some Westerners were told that a Han Chinese would be installed as the emperor. The candidate was either the bearer of the Duke Yansheng title, or the holder of the title \\"Marquis of Extended Grace\\", a title granted to descendants of the imperial family of the Ming dynasty. The Duke Yansheng was proposed for replacing the Qing dynasty as Emperor by Liang Qichao. In 1913, the Beiyang government, led by Yuan Shikai, passed a law allowing the Duke Yansheng title to be retained and held by Kong Lingyi (), a member of the northern branch. The Wujing Boshi title, on the other hand, was renamed to \\"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan\\" () and held by Kong Qingyi (), a member of the southern branch. Yuan Shikai conferred the title of Prince on the Duke immediately before declaring the Empire of China (1915‚Äì16). The regent for the underage Duke Kong Te-cheng was Kong Lingjun Â≠î‰ª§ÂÑÅ. He was the Kong Family Mansion steward. In 1935, the Nationalist government abolished the hereditary peerage systems of the imperial era and converted the Duke Yansheng title into a political office, \\"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan\\" (), which simply means \\"Ceremonial Official to Confucius\\". During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945), Kung Te-cheng (Kong Decheng), the Ceremonial Official to Confucius, evacuated to Hankou, Wuhan, where he was received by Kung Hsiang-hsi (Kong Xiangxi), a fellow descendant of Confucius. They moved to Chongqing later, where the Nationalist government was based during the war. After the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Kung Te-cheng evacuated with the Nationalist government to Taiwan where the current Ceremonial Official to Confucius is based. Until 2008, the office of \\"Ceremonial Official to Confucius\\" had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan. On the other hand, Yan Shiyung (È°è‰∏ñÈèû, the last Ceremonial Official to Yan Hui, 1903-1975) and Kung Xiangkai (Â≠îÁ••Ê•∑, the last Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan, 1938-) didn't move to Taiwan, so their title was abolished after the establishment of People's Republic of China.https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%94%E7%A5%A5%E6%A5%B7 In 1998, the Taiwanese government demolished the office building of the ceremonial official but retained the appointment. The hostel of National Chung Hsing University along Guoguang Road in South District, Taichung is situated at the former location of the office building. In 2008, with approval from the Kong family, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior converted the ceremonial official appointment into an unpaid one. The office is currently held by Kung Tsui- chang (Kong Chuichang), a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius who was appointed in September 2009 after the death of his grandfather, Kung Te-cheng. The Ministry of Interior also declared that female descendants of Confucius are eligible for future appointment. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day, and the title of Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000. The leader of the southern branch is Â≠îÁ••Ê•∑ (Kong Xiangkai), a 75th-generation descendant of Confucius. Traditionally, the descendants of Confucius use generation poems for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors along with the descendants of the other Four Sages ÂõõÊ∞è. Â≠îÂßì (The Kong family, descendants of Confucius) Â≠üÂßì (The Meng family, descendants of Mencius) However, Yan family, one of the Four Sages and descendants of Yanyuan, didn't use the poem eventually because Yanyuan is considered to be a possible maternal cousin of Confucius, so Emperor Yingzong of Ming made another generation poem for Yan family. Traditional Ming dynasty Hanfu robes given by the Ming Emperors to the Chinese noble Dukes Yansheng descended from Confucius are still preserved in the Confucius Mansion after over five centuries. Robes from the Qing emperors are also preserved there. The Jurchens in the Jin dynasty and Mongols in the Yuan dynasty continued to patronize and support the Confucian Duke Yansheng.

Based on archive letters, records and interviews from the time, the series records the lives of the artists who were to transform the art world. Narrative The Impressionists is a tale of motivation, creation, poverty, hope, and of the struggle for recognition, set against a backdrop of war, revolution and Parisian artistic movements. At the heart of the story is the brotherhood of artists, bonded by enduring friendships and their commitment to a new type of art. The story is led by the paintings. Some of the world's most memorable art works are recreated, following the same techniques that the artists used at the time. The series reveals how Claude Monet, in a race against time to capture the light, took just 40 minutes to paint his seminal work Impression, Sunrise; why √âdouard Manet's depiction of Olympia, in which his model brazenly gazes out of the canvas, so outraged Parisian society; and how Paul C√©zanne's 60 paintings of one mountain, Montagne Saint-Victoire, helped to lay the foundations for Cubism and modern art. Julian Glover plays 80-year-old Monet, the \\"Father of Impressionism\\" and narrator of the series. He undertakes a nostalgic but sometimes painful journey as he looks back on his past life in an interview with a journalist conducted at his garden, pond and home in Giverny. Monet remembers arriving as a young man in Paris in 1862, full of dreams about a new kind of art. Young Monet, played by Richard Armitage, leads the group of friends with his vision for paintings that capture the images, energy and light of the modern world. In the drama, Monet describes his fellow artists, friends and supporters with whom he painted, struggled from poverty with and shared experiences, thoughts and art: Fr√©d√©ric Bazille, played by James Lance, the little-known genius who died too soon to enjoy the movement's success but who inspired its first exhibition; Pierre-Auguste Renoir, played by Charlie Condou, an irrepressible lover and painter of women; √âdouard Manet, played by Andrew Havill, whose work was Monet's first inspiration but was censored by society; Edgar Degas, played by Aden Gillett, who captured the back stage reality of the ballet world; and Paul C√©zanne, played by Will Keen, whose innovative work determined the path of modern art. Amanda Root plays Alice Hosched√©, Monet's great love. Using quotes from the primary sources, the series depicts the characters' idiosyncrasies--C√©zanne's hatred of barking dogs, his mistress Hortense's love of lemonade, Monet's flamboyant dress sense, and Degas' irritability.  Production  It was shot on location in Provence and Normandy, at Monet's home and garden at Giverny and at locations in the UK. The series was filmed with the Panasonic SDX 900 DVCPRO 50 professional camcorder in widescreen 25fps progressive mode.  Missing artists  The drama does not include several main impressionist artists such as Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt, Armand Guillaumin, Berthe Morisot and Alfred Sisley.

He began his career as an amateur player for BK Frem, winning the 1944 Danish Championship. He played professionally for French clubs Stade Fran√ßais, Le Havre AC, Olympique Lyonnais, and Grenoble Foot 38, winning the 1954 French Division 2 with Olympique Lyonnais. Kaj Christiansen scored six goals in five matches for the Denmark national football team between 1943 and 1948. He was named 1943 Danish Sports Talent of the Year. As a manager, he was named 1964 Manager of the Year in France, and won the 1967 Danish Cup with Randers Freja. Biography Kaj Christiansen started his amateur footballing career with KFUM's Boldklub, but like so many of his prolific KFUM teammates, he eventually moved to a larger Copenhagen club to make his national breakthrough. Christiansen moved to BK Frem, where he made his senior debut against Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub (KB) on 21 March 1943. He scored four goals in the first half, but KB retaliated with six goals in the second half, and Frem lost 4‚Äì6. Boldklubben Frem profile Playing in the centre forward position, Christiansen was seen as the natural successor of Frem's club icon and the most popular Danish footballer of his time, centre forward Pauli J√∏rgensen. Rather than J√∏rgensen's physical style, Kaj Christiansen was a quick player of great anticipation. Just months after his debut for Frem, Christiansen made his debut for the Denmark national football team in June 1943, the last Danish international game during the Second World War. He scored two goals on headers in the debut game, a 3‚Äì2 win against the Sweden national football team, with Danish King Christian X in attendance. He was subsequently named 1943 Danish Sports Talent of the Year. In his first season with Frem, Kaj Christiansen and the team won the 1943‚Äì44 Danish Championship. When the Danish national team played its next games in 1945, Christiansen played two games and scored two goals that year. He scored two additional goals in another two international games, playing one each in 1946 and 1948. In 1948, Kaj Christiansen signed a professional contract. He was thus ineligible to play for the amateur-only Danish national team, and was not picked for the Danish team which won bronze medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics.\\"D√∏dsfald\\", Horsens Folkeblad, 25 January 2008 Kaj Christiansen played seven seasons as a professional in French football. He signed with French team Stade Fran√ßais in 1948. He played a single season in the club, finishing 10th in the 1948‚Äì49 French Division 1 season. He then moved to Division 2 team Le Havre AC, which he helped finish 2nd in the 1949‚Äì50 French Division 2, winning promotion for Division 1. He stayed a further two seasons with Le Havre, helping the club to impressive 3rd and 7th-place finishes in the Division 1. In 1952, Christiansen moved to newly relegated Division 2 team Olympique Lyonnais. In his second year at the club, Lyonnais won the 1953‚Äì54 French Division 2 and secured promotion for Division 1. Kaj Christiansen moved on to Division 2 team Grenoble Foot 38, for whom he played his last season as an active player.Kaj Christiansen. worldfootball.net Following his active career, Christiansen turned to the role of football coach. He took a coaching license in France, and was named 1964 Manager of the Year in France.

The series, at the time of its cancellation, was hosted by Mike Golic. Lighter Side is the first and longest- running of Rotfeld's productions, utilizing Rotfeld's extensive collection of stock footage. Cable The first incarnation of The Lighter Side of Sports aired on ESPN from 1986 to 1990. In addition to sports bloopers, interviews with sports figures and comedians in front of a live audience were included, along with music from the house bands, The Flamin' Caucasians (1986‚Äì1988) and Nik and the Nice Guys (1989‚Äì1990). Jay Johnstone was the original host, later replaced in 1989 by Jim Valvano. Syndication: Bob Uecker shows The idea behind the current version of The Lighter Side of Sports had its genesis in Bob Uecker's Wacky World of Sports (also known as Bob Uecker's Sports Show), which began airing in syndication in 1985. As the name implied, \\"Mr. Baseball\\" Bob Uecker was the host of a sort of mock talk show. Uecker's incarnation involved numerous sports bloopers and oddities, as well as numerous jokes and sketches involving Uecker himself, often in front of a live audience. Since Rotfeld had just begun compiling stock footage at the time, that required more room for comedy. A typical episode would include a few comedy sketches featuring Uecker (usually leading into a series of clips), three music videos, an interview with an actor posing as an eccentric athlete of some sort, and the rest filled with sports bloopers and videos of unusual sports, many of which date back several decade. Mike Golic era In the 1990s, Uecker left the show, and the concept was revamped. ESPN's \\"Lighter Side\\" and the Uecker series were merged into a new show that retained the Lighter Side name. A synthesizer-based theme song and digitally-generated opening sequence was produced, and Golic was tapped to host. Uecker's sketches were replaced with more bloopers and spectacular sports accidents, and Golic's role was reduced to one comparable to a disc jockey, introducing clips coming in and out of commercial breaks (often at some sporting venue as part of a running gag to tie the show together). In its over fifteen-year run, only 46 episodes hosted by Golic were produced. Only a few new episodes have been produced each year (most of the Golic run was produced in the early-to-middle 1990s), so to fill the gap, all 46 Golic-hosted shows air in rotation, with new shows added in as they are produced. The series ended its syndication run some time in the late 2000s as Rotfeld shifted his focus to cable television and educational/informational-compliant programming. The Uecker and ESPN versions of the show have not been seen since the early 1990s, although at least two Uecker episodes were released to VHS under the title \\"The Best of Bob Uecker's Wacky World of Sports, Volumes 1 and 2.\\" 65 ESPN episodes were produced, and 30 shows were produced that Uecker hosted (18 under the Wacky World title and 12 under the Sports Show title).

It features the first cinematic appearance of a flying saucer, as the secret weapon of the villainous Recorder. Plot Dr Benson (Forrest Taylor), a friend of charter pilot Bruce Gentry (Tom Neal), is kidnapped by the mysterious enemy agent, \\"the Recorder\\" who only issues orders through recordings. Benson is used to perfect the villain's flying saucers, launched and controlled by electronic means. Industrialist Paul Radcliffe (Hugh Prosser) hires Bruce to investigate the saucers as he thinks they may have a commercial use. Necessary for the production of the flying saucers is a mineral called Platonite. The Recorder's only source, an abandoned mine on the land belonging to Jaunita (Judy Clark) and Frank Farrell (Ralph Hodges), has run dry and he needs to steal supplies from the US Government. When Bruce closes in on The Recorder, he finds out that his prey is actually Dr. Benson. Krendon (Tristram Coffin), one of his henchmen, releases a deadly flying saucer on an attack against the Panama Canal. In his aircraft, Bruce intercepts the saucer, crashing into it, and escaping the resultant explosion by taking to his parachute. Back at The Recorder's headquarters, the saucer controls explode, killing all the enemy agents. =Cliffhangers= At the end of chapter 14, Gentry drives over a cliff on a motorbike.

Faris, Ph.D. is an engineer and entrepreneur. Early life and education Sadeg Faris was brought up in Tripoli in a poor family. His father died when he was ten years old and he was raised in orphanage. He won a scholarship from Esso Libya to go to college in the US. Faris received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in 1969, 1971 and 1976 in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, from the University of California, Berkeley. His PhD thesis project was completed in 1976 and was called \\"Characteristics of Metal- Barrier-Metal Diodes and Their Applications\\". Career Upon graduating from Berkeley Faris joined the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center labs in Yorktown, NY, and became part of a group working on developing chips exploiting the Josephson effect. In 1983 while he was at IBM he proposed the \\"quiteron,\\" a superconducting three-terminal, three layer switching device similar to transistor. It was distinct from superconductive Josephson junctions, and was instead designed on principles of quantum tunneling by injecting quasiparticles through the two thin insulator layers separating the three superconducting layers.Superconducting highway to low-noise chips. New Scientist, February 10, 1983, p. 369. The original quiteron consisted of three superconducting layers. Two layers were made of niobium, the third of lead- indium-gold alloy. They were insulated with silicon monoxide and niobium oxide layers. As of 2011 quiterons were not commercially used. In the fall of 1983 IBM shut down its efforts to develop chips based on superconductive Josephson junctions, as did Bell Labs and Sperry at around the same time. In April 1983 Faris had left IBM to found Hypres to commercialize work he had done at IBM; the company licensed patents from IBM. Hypres at first developed and sold a Josephson sampling oscilloscope and later became a low-temperature superconductor foundry. In 1990 Faris founded Reveo with a vision of following Thomas Edison's model of applying science to generate new products, and spinning them out into new companies. In October 2003 Reveo and the Government of Malaysia started a research and development centre named InventQjaya; the goal of the government was to achieve technological sovereignty by 2020. The arrangements were based on Faris' relationship with Mahathir Mohamad, who was then the prime minister. The center was set up a wholly owned subsidiary of Reveo and was funded by the government; the government committed to a total of RM437mil in funding and had made RM228mil available as of February 2005, when the government froze the accounts of InventQjaya. The accounts were frozen based on allegations made by the Malayasian independent directors who had been appointed to the board of InventQjaya that Faris' claims about the technology he wanted to commercialize through InventQjaya might be fraudulent, as well as claims by InventQjaya's recently fired chief financial officer that RM50mil in funds had been inappropriately transferred to Reveo. The seizure order was lifted in January 2006. By 2007, Reveo said that it had spun out four companies: eVionyx in New York and Taiwan for metal fuel cells, VRex in New York for 3-D stereoscopic imaging, purOgen in New York for oxygen separation technology, and Chelix in California for cholesteric liquid crystal applications. As of 2008, Reveo was developing a single molecule DNA sequencing technology that used physical probes, each tuned to one of four frequencies, to sense nucleotides. In 2009 the New York Intellectual Property Law Association named him 2009 Inventor of the Year.

The LIP factory, based in Besan√ßon in eastern France, began to experience financial problems in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and management decided to attempt a factory shutdown. However, after strikes and a highly publicized factory occupation in 1973, LIP became worker-managed. All the fired employees were rehired by March 1974, but the firm was liquidated again in the spring of 1976. This led to a new struggle, called \\"the social conflict of the 1970s\\" by the daily newspaper Lib√©ration.Lip Lip Lip hourra!, Lib√©ration, 20 March 2007 Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise D√©mocratique du Travail (CFDT) union leader Charles Piaget led the strike. The Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which included former Radical Pierre Mend√®s-France, was then in favor of autogestion (workers' self- management).  History  right In 1807, the Jewish community of Besan√ßon offered a mechanical pocket watch to Napoleon. Sixty years later, Emmanuel Lipman and his sons founded a clockwork workshop under the name of Comptoir Lipmann. In 1893 it became the Soci√©t√© Anonyme d'Horlogerie Lipmann Fr√®res (Lipmann Brothers Clock Factory). The firm launched the Lip stopwatch in 1896. Thereafter Lip became the brand name of the company. They built approximately 2,500 pieces per year. The company launched the first electronic watch in 1952, called \\"Electronic\\" (considered 'electronic' rather than electric due to the presence of a diode). The first 'Electronic' models were worn by Charles de Gaulle and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower; while previously in 1948, LIP's iconic T18 model was offered to Winston Churchill. However, in the 1960s, this highly specialized company began to have financial troubles. Fred Lipmann, who changed his name to Fred Lip, took the company public in 1967, and Ebauches S.A. (subsidiary of ASUAG, a large Swiss consortium which later became Swatch) took 33% of the shares. Meanwhile, workers started organizing to improve labor conditions. This proved difficult. Charles Piaget, the son of a clockwork artisan, who began working at the factory in 1946 as a skilled worker, became a representative of the Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Travailleurs Chr√©tiens (CFTC, French Confederation of Christian Workers) trade union. He later recalled that during national strikes, only 30 or 40 workers at LIP out of a total of 1200 would go on strike. Those who did strike were listed by the management and called in to explain themselves. Semi-skilled workers on the assembly line were not allowed to talk or move more than 25 centimeters (less than ten inches) during their shifts.Le√ßons d'autogestion (Autogestion Lessons), interview with Charles Piaget on Mouvements In 1964, the CFTC became the CFDT, a secular trade union. Piaget participated in some meetings of the ACO (Action Catholique Ouvri√®re, Workers' Catholic Action), and then joined the Union de la gauche socialiste (UGS, Union of the Socialist Left) during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). The UGS later merged with other organizations to form the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which included Pierre Mend√®s-France, a popular left-wing figure who had been President of the Council during the Fourth Republic. During the nationwide unrest of May 1968, the workers at LIP voted to join the general strike. Fred Lip tried to smooth down the growing discontent. He spoke to the union workers of taylorism (scientific management), and proposed to increase the number of representatives on the comit√© d'entreprise (works council, the workers' representation in the factory), in order to have younger representatives. Although this was illegal, the union workers agreed, and elections were organized. Although Fred Lip had believed this would allow him more control of the workers, in less than a year all the young representatives joined the CFTC. Fred Lip then submitted a proposal to the inspection du travail (government labor inspection office) which would eliminate all of the sector of the company to which most of the union workers belonged, including Charles Piaget. However, he offered Piaget a promotion, naming him head of the workshop. For the next year, the workers blocked attempts to eliminate the department, opposing those who tried to move the machines out of the factory.PSU, ¬´Un an de lutte chez Lip¬ª, suppl√©ment √† Critique Socialiste (Revue th√©orique du PSU), n¬∞5, 1971. However, Ebauches became the biggest shareholder in 1970, taking control of 43% of the stock. Ebauches then fired 1,300 workers.Lip heure par heure (Lip hour by hour), in L'Humanit√©, 22 October 2005 The next year, the board of directors forced Fred Lip to resign, replacing him with Jacques Saint-Esprit. LIP built the first French quartz watches in 1973, but had to face increasing competition from the United States and Japan. The firm was forced to start liquidation formalities on April 17, 1973, leading Jacques Saint-Esprit to resign on the same day. In the following weeks, the struggles at the LIP factory drew a national audience, thus beginning one of the emblematic social conflicts of the era after May 1968. The conflict was to last several years.  1973: beginning of the strike and demonstrations  In May 1973, an Action Committee (CA, Comit√© d'action), influenced by the May 1968 movement, was founded. During an extraordinary works council meeting on June 12, 1973, workers stumbled upon the management's plans to restructure and downsize, which had been kept secret from them (one note said \\"450 √† d√©gager\\", \\"get rid of 450\\"). The company then employed 1,300 workers.LIP, l'imagination au pouvoir, article by Serge Halimi in Le Monde diplomatique, 20 March 2007 At first, Charles Piaget, now an official of the Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise D√©mocratique du Travail union and active in the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), opposed a strike, preferring a slowdown, in which workers would pause for ten minutes an hour. However, the workers were angry at the secret restructuring plan and immediately occupied the factory. On the same day, June 12, they took two administrators and an inspecteur du travail (government labor inspector) as hostages. The workers wanted to exchange them for \\"more precise information,\\" declared Piaget (as shown in the 2007 film documentary). However, around midnight, the three hostages were quickly rescued by the CRS riot police in a violent assault. According to Piaget, this assault shocked the workers, who had been careful during previous strikes not to damage the factory in any way. Having lost their human hostages, the workers decided to take materials hostage to block the restructuring plans. They seized 65,000 watches and hid them in various remote locations. They discussed the moral legitimacy of the action, wondering if it was a theft or a sinCatholicism was strong in this region. But the Dominican priest and worker Jean Raguen√®s, who himself was close to Maoism, absolved the workers in advance. The workers also took the plans of the factory, to avoid any risk of the competition obtaining these industrial secrets. The following day, the workers held a general assembly and decided to occupy the factory day and night. The strike was led by Charles Piaget. Half the workers were by then affiliated with a union, either the CFDT or the CGT; most belonged to the CFDT. The leaders were mostly members of the Action Catholique Ouvri√®re (AOC, Workers' Catholic Action) and of popular education movements. They included Charles Piaget, Roland Vittot, Raymond Burgy, worker-priest Jean Raguenes, and an executive of the company, Michel Jeanningros. Two women, Jeannine Pierre- Emile and Fatima Demougeot, were also CFDT leaders at LIP. No√´lle Dartevelle and Claude Mercet were the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail (CGT) representatives.Lip, h√©ros des Temps Modernes in L'Humanit√©, 18 April 2007 The workers now decided to open up the factory to outsiders, including journalists. This made them more popular. At first, Jacques Ch√©r√™que, the national leader of the CFDT metallurgist section, was wary of the Action Committee. At request of the striking workers, he sent a representative, Fredo Coutet, a metal worker, to discuss the strike with the local section of the CFTC. After a week, Coutet was convinced by his experience, but Ch√©r√™que remained wary. At that time, the workers were still skeptical about trying self-management, and requested an employer. Led by Fran√ßois Ch√©r√™que, the CFDT now tried to find an employer to buy the firm.\\"Ils voulaient un patron, pas une coop√©rative ouvri√®re\\" , (\\"They wanted a boss, not a cooperative enterprise.\\") interview with Michel Rocard in Le Monde, 20 March 2007  An experience in workers' self-management (1973‚Äì74)  A large demonstration of 12,000 persons in the average-size town of Besan√ßon, took place on June 15, 1973.\\"Les Lip, l'imagination au pouvoir\\": le samedi soir et le grand soir, Le Monde, March 20, 2007 Three days later, a general assembly of the workers decided to continue production of watches, under the workers' control, to insure \\"survival wages.\\" The LIP struggle was thereafter popularized with the slogan C'est possible: on fabrique, on vend, on se paie! (It is possible: we make them, we sell them, we pay ourselves!). The CGT-CFDT union alliance (intersyndicale) now asked the Cahiers de Mai magazine to assist them in making a newspaper dedicated to the strike. Named Lip-Unit√© (Lip-Unity), this newspaper would help popularize the movement. To be able to restart production at the factory, this time without an employer, they sold the watches that they had seized. In six weeks, they made the equivalent of half the revenue of a normal year. Michel Rocard, then national secretary of the PSU, took part in the sale of the watches. \\"The question of women was a revolution inside the revolution,\\" Piaget declared later. The clock factory had a majority of female workers, especially among semi-skilled workers (OS, ouvrier sp√©cialis√©) working on the assembly line.PSU, ¬´ Lip au f√©minin ¬ª, Critique Socialiste, n¬∞5, 1971 The national leadership of the CGT union now tried to take control, calling meetings during the day against the workers' will. Finally, a large part of the members of the CGT moved to the CFDT, and the CGT decided to let them go. Despite these tensions with the leadership of the CGT, Charles Piaget later declared that the \\"Communists remained essential.\\". Pierre Messmer's Minister of Industrial Development, Jean Charbonnel, a historic figure of left-wing Gaullism, named Henri Giraud as mediator of the conflict. The government then proposed a new plan, which included the firing of 159 employees (or 180, out of a total of 1,200.) On August 3, 1973, the workers refused this offer. Negotiations between the trade-unions, the Action Committee and the mediator Giraud started again on August 11. Four days later, the Mobile Gendarmerie (a military unit) occupied the factory and expelled the workers. The military remained until February 1974. After this violent occupation, many firms of Besan√ßon and of the region decided to go on strike, and workers rushed to the LIP factory to fight the military forces. Union leaders tried to intercede to prevent any confrontation, but the government proceeded to order arrests, which led to court convictions in the following days. On September 29, 1973, there was a national protest at Besan√ßon; 100,000 persons demonstrated under pouring rain. The protest was nicknamed the marche des 100,000 (March of 100,000). Ch√©r√™que of the CFDT disapproved of this demonstration, fearing that the police would be provoked. An old farmer then went to see Michel Rocard and told him that he had heard, during a family meeting, a member of the special police forces boast that he had thrown Molotov cocktails and burned more cars than the May '68 demonstrators. Rocard decided to send a letter to the organizers of the demonstration, warning them. The demonstration was non-violent.  End of the first conflict  Prime Minister Pierre Messmer wistfully declared on October 15, 1973: \\"LIP, c'est fini!\\" (LIP, it's over!). Behind the scenes, some progressive managers of the CNPF employers' union, including Antoine Riboud, CEO of BSN, Renaud Gillet, CEO of Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and Jos√© Bidegain, deputy president of the CNPF, tried to find a solution to the conflict. Finally, Claude Neuschwander, then number 2 at the Publicis advertising group and member of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), agreed to become the factory's manager. LIP became a subsidiary of BSN, and Neuschwander managed to have Antoine Riboud bypass the regular control of weekly accounts. Neuschwander advocated \\"the death of enterprise capitalism and the advent of finance capitalism\\".or, in the words of L'Humanit√©, the transition from paternalistic capitalism, under Fred Lip, to modern finance capitalism In the meanwhile, beside the PSU, all the far-left movements supported the LIP self-management experiment. LIP workers took part in the 1973-74 struggle in the Larzac against the extension of a military base (photos). However, tensions increased between the CFDT and the CGT unions. The LIP delegation and the factory management signed the Dole agreement on January 29, 1974. The Compagnie europ√©enne d'horlogerie (European Clockwork Co.), directed by Claude Neuschwander, took control of LIP. Neuschwander had 850 former workers rehired in March, and the strike ended. By December 1974, the conflict appeared to be finished: the workers no longer ran the factory, and all of the employees were rehired. However, in May 1974, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, representing free enterprise, had been elected President of France, with the support of Jacques Chirac. They opposed this union victory at a time when downsizing was happening all over France. The previous Minister of Industrial Development, Jean Charbonnel, testified that Giscard had declared: \\"LIP must be punished. Let them be unemployed and stay that way. Otherwise they will infect all of society.\\"French: ¬´Il faut les punir [les Lip]. Qu'ils soient ch√¥meurs et qu'ils le restent. Ils vont v√©roler tout le corps social.¬ª According to Charbonnel, the employers and Chirac's government had deliberately \\"assassinated LIP.\\" This was done by confronting the left-wing employer, Neuschwander, and the firm with unforeseen difficulties. Renault, a state enterprise, withdrew its orders, and the Ministry of Industry refused promised funding. In contradiction to the D√¥le agreement of January 1974, the commercial court (tribunal de commerce) requested that LIP honor a debt of 6 million Francs owed by the former firm to providers.  1976: the second movement  thumb Shareholders forced Claude Neuschwander to resign on February 8, 1976, and the Compagnie europ√©enne d'horlogerie started liquidation proceedings in April. Problems between workers and management began again. On May 5, 1976, LIP workers again occupied the factory, restarting the production of watches. Lib√©ration newspaper, founded three years before by Jean-Paul Sartre, printed the headline, \\"Lip, c'est reparti!\\" (Lip, it's starting again!). No one offered to take over LIP this time. The firm was definitively liquidated on 12 September 1977. After long internal debates, on November 28, 1977, the workers created a cooperative, named \\"Les Industries de Palente\\" (Palente's Industries)Palente was the neighborhood of Besan√ßon where the factory was located. The LIP acronym remained. Charles Piaget testified in 1977, in the Quotidien de Paris, about the self-management experiment: > A few more than 500 workers are effectively in battle, gathering every day, > and this, nineteen months after having been fired. It is living proof of > democracy. It is impossible to have such a collective force without the > sustained practice of democracy, without sharing responsibilities, and > without participation of all sorts. It must be pointed out that at LIP, the > workers are in charge of approximately thirty jobs, from the restaurant, > which serves 300 meals a day for 4 francs, to a hairdresser for the > unemployed, to a judicial commission for these same unemployed, to various > artisanal activities, one being the game Ch√¥mageopoly (\\"Ch√¥mage\\" means > unemployment in French), which has already sold more than 6,000 games, and > finally industrial production. The second struggle did not end until 1980, when six cooperatives, employing 250 workers out of a total of 850, were created. Most of the other workers who had joined the struggle (around 400) were either hired by the city, or signed agreements granting them early retirement. The cooperatives lasted between 3 and 12 years. Three of them, which have since become incorporated, still exist today, employing a hundred workers each. For instance, some former LIP workers returned to work in Palente with the SCOP (Soci√©t√© coop√©rative de production) cooperative Lip Pr√©cision Industrie, which employs about twenty persons. SCOP focuses on precision mechanics. According to Charles Piaget, the difficulties of the second conflict, compared to the large victory obtained in 1974, could be explained by the May 1974 election of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, whose government decided not to help companies in a difficult situation, and by the 1973 oil crisis.  LIP in the 1980s and the 1990s  The LIP cooperative was bought back by Kipl√© in 1984, during Fran√ßois Mitterrand's presidency. However, the new firm was liquidated six years later. Jean-Claude Sensemat then bought the brand in 1990, and relaunched the production with modern marketing methods. The sales increased to a million watches a year. The LIP reissued Charles de Gaulle's watch, which Jean-Claude Sensemat offered to U.S. President Bill Clinton. In 2002, Sensemat signed a LIP world license contract with Jean-Luc Bernerd, who created La Manufacture G√©n√©rale Horlog√®re in Lectoure Gers for the occasion. Charles Piaget is today a member of AC! (Agir ensemble contre le ch√¥mage), a union of unemployed people, while the Dominican Jean Raguen√®s lives in Brazil, where he supports the Landless Workers' Movement (MST).

The first record of the name appears in the Basque regions of Spain. The name was purportedly constructed by combining the names of three brothers. The surname appears between the 11th and 14th centuries in the northern Spanish region of Roncesvalles. References to the family name appear with increasing frequency from the 15th to the 19th century, specially in regards to the negotiation with the French in the Treaty of Devolutionin 1662. Shield The family shield, a silver sword on a red background, indicates the name is of military origin and proven valor. Many such shields were awarded to families for their heroic involvement in acts of war. On the coat of arms, red represents strength, power, and a fervent love to God and fellow man. The silver sword represents proven acts of valor in the battlefield. History =Ancient history= The Sobalvarro surname first appeared in the Basque regions of Spain. Because the Basque were the last remnants of the older Western Europe, the last name became known when there was conflict inside of Spain. The Basque tribes were mentioned by Strabo and Pliny as early as the 2nd century B.C. Stories of heroic acts by Sobalvarros are told by the Vascones and the Aquitani in the languages of Aquitaine, Basque, and Iru√±a- Veleia. These languages were already present in the area when the tribes began to migrate to the north-west from southern and southwestern present-day Europe. =Middle Ages= The last name survived the Middle Ages even when Muslims and Franks fragmented the territory. Previous to this invasion, there was a coat of arms present in battles serving under the Castilian noblesse. The Sobalvarro name then began to expand within the newly formed Kingdom of Castile and Kingdom of Pamplona. In the early to mid-15th century, influences from Aragonese, Castilian, and French neighbors began to cause feuds for the Navarre region. Once all of the feuds were settled, Navarre was eventually divided into pieces that neighboring countries and kingdoms annexed. The southernmost area that was not annexed was given as part of a treaty to France. This was the 1662 French Treaty of Devolution, during the War of Devolution, under the reign of Phillip IV. The treaty was proposed and constructed by Jean Sobalvarro. The self-governing Basque gave him the power to negotiate alongside the French to prevent the area from engaging in violence. The country continuously struggled to state its own independent country. The surname later spread throughout France and Spain and into parts of Italy. =Present day= The surname appears in Germany, North America, and some parts of South and Central America, where it was assumed by native plantation workers on farms owned and operated by Sobalvarro families. Currently, the largest group of Sobalvarros are found in Central American countries, specifically in Nicaragua and Guatemala. The second largest density is found in regions of Italy: Vicenza, Venito or Venetia. The surname migrated to this part of Europe around 12th century A.D. The third largest population is in the United States of America. The name spread from over 20 different states. First records date this surname to have emerged as early as the 18th century. The surname was legally entered through the immigration dock in Ellis Island, New York. In Europe, the surname appears in several forms: Sobalvarro, Sobahlvarro, Sobalbarro, Svarro, Sbarro, and Sobarro. This is due to the difference in pronunciation between countries.

It is traditionally spoken by the Sri Lankan Malays and among some Sinhalese in Hambantota.http://sealang.net/archives/nusa/pdf/nusa-v50-p43-57.pdf Today, the number of speakers of the language have dwindled considerably but it has continued to be spoken notably in the Hambantota District of Southern Sri Lanka, which has traditionally been home to many Sri Lankan Malays.  History  During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch who had occupied Batavia of Java exiled native rebels and royalty to Sri Lanka, and they made their first settlements in Hambantota and Kirinde. Later on, the Dutch also garrisoned their military, composed of Malays, in other parts of Sri Lanka. As a result, some scholars even believe that SLM is closely associated with the Batavian dialect of Malay. Today, Sri Lankan Malay (SLM), is spoken in the Central (Kandy), Southern (Hambantota and Kirinde) and Western (Slave Island) provinces of the country. The Malay population living in Kinniya and Mutur no longer speak Malay and have resorted to either Sri Lankan Tamil or Sri Lankan Moor Tamil (SLMT). The majority of the speakers today reside in Northern Colombo. The exact number of speakers is unknown and there are no linguistic statistics available on the number of speakers living in or outside of Sri Lanka. Based on the ethnic statistics of Sri Lankan Malays, the estimation of the number of Sri Lankan Malay speakers is probably between 30,000 to 40,000.  Variation  As the language has been influenced by Sinhala, Tamil and English, SLM speakers constantly code-switch between SLM and either one or two of the other mentioned languages. As a result, SLM within the three mentioned provinces, have taken a distinctive character of their own. Sebastian Nydorf has produced ‚ÄúA Grammar of Upcountry Malay‚Äù highlighting the said regional variations, however, his efforts have been criticised for having widening disparities within the language. Due to these differences, there are contesting opinions among the SLM speakers themselves: while some speakers say that Malay in Kirinde and Hambantota is of higher status due to its closeness to archaic Malay, others claim that Malay of Slave Island is more vibrant in its evolution, especially in its use of slang which has even been adopted by the Moors. A result of this variation within spoken SLM is a call for standardisation in the written variety, following Bahasa Kumpulan (standardised Malay in Malaysia and Indonesia). Malays who first arrived in Sri Lanka, keeping with their customs and practices, used the gundul alphabet for writing, which was the Arabic script with five additional letters. This practice had survived till the mid-1940s, and had only been used among specific individuals (such as religious/communal figures) and served limited and exclusive purposes as a minority language within the country. For instance, Malay bills of marriage (kavin) were drawn in gundul. Presently, however, both ‚ÄúStandard Malay‚Äù (SM) and SLM use the Romanised script for writing purposes. Some of the advocates of the Romanised script claim that using English following (their interpretation of) Standard British English must be the only way of writing Malay. For instance, using ‚Äòch‚Äô instead of the letter ‚Äòc‚Äô for the /ch/ sound (failing to realise that ‚Äòch‚Äô could also produce the /k/ sound). Other users and scholars of SLM claim that Sinhala, being a phonetical alphabet, would be better suited for writing Malay as it would better capture Malay pronunciation. Much studies have not been done on the particular variety of SLM but there are debates that SLM is endangered. ‚Äú Much work remains to be done on the various varieties of SLM‚Äù. In Colombo community, parents encourage their children to speak in English therefore SLM is endangered in that community . Concerning the Cosmopolitan Colombo community, where the level of education is high, the community typically shows strong linguistic vitality in SLM in the oldest to middle generations and rapidly decreasing linguistic competence (to nil) in the vernacular in the young generation. In sharp contrast is the speech community of Kirinda, with low education and employment levels who still have SLM as a dominant language. The current thrust in the SLM community is that some segments of the community especially those in Kirinda, believe that SLM language must be encouraged, taught, and strengthened while others in the Colombo community believe that Malaysian or Indonesian Malay should be taught as means of revitalising SLM by converging it with a more standardised variety. The Kirinda community in Hambantota is one of the few communities that speak Sri Lankan Malay as their dominant language. Although children in the Kirinda community remain, monolingual speakers of Sri Lankan Malay, before they enter primary school, the speakers of Sri Lankan Malay today are insufficient to maintain the language in future generations. In some communities, Sri Lankan Malay is clearly endangered but there is a debate about whether it is endangered overall since some communities have robust first language speakers. Trilingualism is achieved by the SLM community due to contact with the larger group of Tamil and the majority of Sinhalese speakers because Sinhala and Tamil were adstrates. Therefore the restructuring process that occurs in SLM has several grammatical categories that are absent from other Malay varieties, but are found in both Sinhala and Tamil. Considering that mixed languages typically show lexical items predominantly from one source, and grammatical material predominantly from another, the SLM lexicon is primarily of PMD origin while grammatical features are derived from Sinhala and Tamil. Therefore the use of inflections is largely due to a process of typological congruence of Lankan adstrates. Dative and accusative are marked by suffixes attached to a noun (na∆û-DAT ya∆û-ACC). The verb-final order follows the Sinhala and Tamil typology. This is illustrated as follows:Citation error. See inline comment on how to fix it. ni aanak-na∆û baek buku-ya∆û attu aada This student- DAT good book-ACC one exist ‚ÄúThis student has a good book.‚Äù As in Tamil, accusative tends to mark definiteness in SLM. Inni kendera -ya∆û bapi This chair-ACC takes. go ‚ÄúTake this chair away.‚Äù A direct influence of Sinhala is seen in Ablative syncretism marker (to indicate source) ri…ß. Market-ri∆û ais- tra baaru ikka∆û billi bawa Market-ABL ice-NEG new fish buy bring Get me some fresh fish from the market The SLM possessive case suffix is ‚Äòpe‚Äô, derived form of Malaya punya ‚Äúto possess‚Äù distinguishes a feature of contact Malay varieties such as Bazaar Malay and Baba Malay. goppe tumman go-ya∆û e-tolak My friend pushed me As an archaic feature of Malay lingua franca, it is most likely that this feature was maintained from the original varieties of the SLM community and its adaptation led to the development of a new case that distinguishes SLM from its adstrates.

His birthday is often incorrectly listed as 31 October 1832, based on announcements in two Sydney newspapers of a daughter born on that date.

Captain John Dibbs appears to have been at sea in early 1833 so the October 1832 birth date may have been used to avoid any scandal. was an Australian banker. Dibbs was born in George Street, Sydney, the second son of Captain John Dibbs of St Andrews, Scotland, and brother of New South Wales Premier Sir George Dibbs. His father \\"disappeared at sea\\" when he was a boy, and at the age of 14 Dibbs entered the service of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney as a junior clerk. In 1857 he became accountant, and 10 years later was appointed general manager, a position he held for 48 years. In 1877 Dibbs published a booklet Interest Tables and established some important banking practices in Sydney. In 1915 Dibbs retired at the age of 82, when he was made an honorary director of the bank and given a pension of ¬£2000 a year. In 1916 he presented his house, Graythwaite, North Sydney, to the Commonwealth for a home for sick and wounded soldiers. Dibbs died at Sydney on 18 March 1923. He married in 1857 Tryphena Gaden who survived him with six daughters. He was knighted in 1917. He was much interested in the Church of England, and was treasurer of the church buildings loan and other funds. He was also a trustee of various public funds. He was well known as a yachtsman He owned the Steam Yacht \\"Ena\\". In the early 1990s the sunken wreck of the Ena was located in a river in Tasmania. Due to the depth and cold fresh water, the vessel was almost fully intact and in surprisingly good condition. After being raised, it was returned to Sydney, completely restored at a cost of about A$2 million.

He built up a fine staff from which he had complete loyalty, and he guided the affairs of his bank with ability for a period which was probably record-breaking. He discouraged the land-booming of the 1880s, and when the crash came in 1893 met the situation with wisdom. For many years Dibbs was the trusted confidential adviser in financial matters of the various New South Wales governments, and when he retired in 1915 the government of the state presented an address to him expressing \\"profound recognition of the invaluable services rendered by him to vital public interests . . . a testimony without parallel in the history of Australian business life\\".

Background Wyndham was born on 4 June 1736, the eldest surviving son of Henry Wyndham of St Edmund's College, Salisbury, and his wife Arundel Penruddocke, daughter of Thomas Penruddocke of Compton Chamberlayne. Colonel Wadham Wyndham was his younger brother and the distinguished judge Sir Wadham Wyndham was his great-great-grandfather. He was educated at Eton and Wadham College, Oxford, and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 6 February 1777 and a fellow of the Royal Society on 9 January 1783. Politics The Wyndhams of the College held great influence in Salisbury, and Wyndham was elected a freeman of the city on 15 March 1761, was Mayor of Salisbury in 1770-1, and High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1772. In 1794 he commanded a troop of cavalry raised in Salisbury. In 1795 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Wiltshire. He sat as a Whig in the family tradition until 1812, but rarely attended Parliament. The Whig statesman, William Windham and Prime Minister William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, were his third cousins. Publications By inclination he was more of a topographer than a politician. In 1774 he visited Wales, and in the following year he published anonymously A Gentleman's Tour through Monmouthshire and Wales. He revisited the area in 1777, and in 1781 published his Tour through Monmouthshire and Wales, declaring authorship of the work. He was accompanied on his journey of 1777 by the Swiss watercolourist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, whose works illustrated the account. He was keen to produce a county history of Wiltshire and published Wiltshire, Extracted from the Domesday Book with a translation of the Latin into English in 1788 which he hoped might stimulate such a work. His most celebrated publication remains his Diary of the Late George Bubb Dodington in 1784, a rich source of information about politics in the first half of the 18th century. Friendship with Turner Like his cousin George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, Pen Wyndham was an admirer of the painter Turner who stayed with him at the College on several occasions in the late 18th century. Two paintings of the College landscape made by Turner during his visits of 1798 and c1800 are now preserved in the British Museum. Family life He married Caroline, daughter and heir of Edmund Hearst, on 18 October 1768 and they had five sons and two daughters. He died on 3 May 1819 and was buried in the Wyndham family vault in St Edmund's Church, Salisbury. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Wadham Wyndham, MP for Salisbury. His sister, Laetitia, married Sir William √† Court, 1st Baronet.

It contains characters found in previous Robinson novels. Plot summary The Siberians who have made a huge market in the oil business are planning on a reform to gain recognition as a nation and probably gain independence from the Russian Federation. In response the Russian military eliminates vital oil business leaders to maintain control over the oil and the Siberian economy. Recognizing that this control may soon become unstable, they turn to an alternative‚Äîthe rich oil fields of Falkland Islands. They persuade the Argentines to co-ordinate an invasion of the islands citing the Argentine sovereignty over them. This would also serve as a guise for a Russian oil rig to be developed on the island. The Russians also send a submarine called the Viper to assist the Argentines. Britain which holds governance over the Falklands begins to suspect the invasion. Royal Navy is sent by their prime minister to prevent the invasion and protect the Brits living in Falklands. Unlike the previous war over the islands which the British had won, the Argentines destroy the advancing British navy and claim the islands for their own. However, a Special Air Service special operations team is stranded on the island and a massive manhunt is on to find and terminate them. Admiral Arnold Morgan, the former National Security Advisor to the US President takes the helm in putting together a crack team of Navy Seals led by Commander Rick Hunter on a mission to extract the S.A.S team and damage Argentine Air Force assets. Through this, he hopes that the Argentines will release control of the Exxon Mobil oil rig on the island. The SEAL team strategically takes out Argentine fighters and destroys runways to create havoc and frustration in the Argentine command. They also extract the S.A.S team. On understanding the objectives of the American strike, the Argentine government decides to release the Exxon Mobil officials and return control of the oil rig to the Americans and the British. They also call for a complete hand over of the governance over the islands from the British.

Mesoporous silica is a mesoporous form of silica and a recent development in nanotechnology. The most common types of mesoporous nanoparticles are MCM-41 and SBA-15.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were independently synthesized in 1990 by researchers in Japan. They were later produced also at Mobil Corporation laboratories and named Mobil Composition of Matter (or Mobil Crystalline Materials, MCM). Six years later, silica nanoparticles with much larger (4.6 to 30 nanometer) pores were produced at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The material was named Santa Barbara Amorphous type material, or SBA-15. These particles also have a hexagonal array of pores. The researchers who invented these types of particles planned to use them as molecular sieves. Today, mesoporous silica nanoparticles have many applications in medicine, biosensors, thermal energy storage and imaging. Synthesis Vials of mesoporous silica TEM image of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle Mesoporous silica nanoparticles are synthesized by reacting tetraethyl orthosilicate with a template made of micellar rods. The result is a collection of nano-sized spheres or rods that are filled with a regular arrangement of pores. The template can then be removed by washing with a solvent adjusted to the proper pH. Mesoporous particles can also be synthesized using a simple sol-gel method such as the St√∂ber process, or a spray drying method. Tetraethyl orthosilicate is also used with an additional polymer monomer (as a template). However, TEOS is not the most effective precursor for synthesizing such particles; a better precursor is (3-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, often abbreviated to MPTMS. Use of this precursor drastically reduces the chance of aggregation and ensures more uniform spheres. Drug delivery The large surface area of the pores allows the particles to be filled with a drug or a cytotoxin. Like a Trojan Horse, the particles will be taken up by certain biological cells through endocytosis, depending on what chemicals are attached to the outside of the spheres. Some types of cancer cells will take up more of the particles than healthy cells will, giving researchers hope that MCM-41 will one day be used to treat certain types of cancer. Ordered mesoporous silica (e.g. SBA-15, TUD-1, HMM-33, and FSM-16) also show potential to boost the in vitro and in vivo dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs. Many drug-candidates coming from drug discovery suffer from a poor water solubility. An insufficient dissolution of these hydrophobic drugs in the gastrointestinal fluids strongly limits the oral bioavailability. One example is itraconazole which is an antimycoticum known for its poor aqueous solubility. Upon introduction of itraconazole-on-SBA-15 formulation in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, a supersaturated solution is obtained giving rise to enhanced transepithelial intestinal transport. Also the efficient uptake into the systemic circulation of SBA-15 formulated itraconazole has been demonstrated in vivo (rabbits and dogs). This approach based on SBA-15 yields stable formulations and can be used for a wide variety of poorly water-soluble compounds. Biosensors The structure of these particles allows them to be filled with a fluorescent dye that would normally be unable to pass through cell walls. The MSN material is then capped off with a molecule that is compatible with the target cells. When the MSNs are added to a cell culture, they carry the dye across the cell membrane. These particles are optically transparent, so the dye can be seen through the silica walls. The dye in the particles does not have the same problem with self-quenching that a dye in solution has. The types of molecules that are grafted to the outside of the MSNs will control what kinds of biomolecules are allowed inside the particles to interact with the dye.

It was established Northampton Mental Hospital in 1876 and closed in 1995. The site has since been redeveloped for residential use with a small mental health unit still remaining there. History Work started on the hospital in 1873. It was designed by Robert Griffiths using a corridor layout and opened as the Northampton Mental Hospital in 1876. Additional blocks for children with mental health difficulties and for epileptics were completed in 1887. It served as a military hospital during the First World War and after the war it became Northampton Mental Hospital. It had joined the National Health Service in 1948 and two female patient villas were completed in 1954. The hospital was used as a filming location in the 1977 series of Doctor Who, in a six-part story called The Talons of Weng-Chiang. The mortuary was used to represent a Victorian operating theatre. Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1995. The children's block and the superintendents' house were developed by Taylor Wimpey for residential use between 2005 and 2008 and a small area was applied for the construction of Berrywood Hospital, a modern mental health facility.

It was set by four British Baroque composers - John Weldon, John Eccles, Daniel Purcell and Gottfried Finger - as part of a music competition held in 1700-1701. Thomas Arne later composed a score to the libretto in 1742. Roles *Mercury, messenger of the gods *Paris, a shepherd *Juno, goddess of marriage *Pallas, goddess of war *Venus, goddess of love *Chorus Synopsis Setting: Mount Ida The god Mercury descends from the sky with the golden apple of Discord and asks the shepherd Paris to award it to whichever of the three goddesses - Juno, Pallas and Venus - he finds most worthy. Juno offers him worldly power, Pallas victory in war, and Venus the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris gives the golden apple to Venus. The \\"Musick Prize\\" The Judgment of Paris: a pastoral composed for the music-prize, 1700, by Daniel Purcell A group of English nobles headed by Lord Halifax had become interested in promoting all-sung English opera (most English operas of the day took the form of semi-operas mixing music and spoken drama). In an announcement in the London Gazette of 18 March 1700 they offered a \\"Musick Prize\\" for the best setting of Congreve's short libretto. First prize was 100 guineas, second 50, third 30, and fourth 20.Kemp, Gramophone p.28 Four composers entered the competition: John Weldon, John Eccles, Daniel Purcell and Gottfried Finger. Their works were performed individually during the spring of 1701, then staged together in a grand final at the Dorset Garden Theatre on 3 June 1703. The audience judged the winner. Eccles had been expected to win but in the event he came second to Weldon with Daniel Purcell third and Finger fourth. The competition had little long-term success in promoting all-sung opera in English. The London stage would soon be dominated by Italian opera and both Eccles and Daniel Purcell gave up writing theatre music.Kemp, booklet notes p.9 - 11 The competition was re-staged in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the 1989 BBC Proms season. Anthony Rooley conducted the Consorte of Musicke and Concerto K√∂ln in performances of the three surviving scores (Finger's has been lost). Once again, the audience decided the winner and this time they awarded first prize to Eccles.Kemp, Gramophone, p.29 Arne's version Thomas Arne set The Judgement of Paris as part of a revival of interest in libretti by Congreve in the 1740s (Handel's Semele would appear in 1744). Arne's version was first performed at Drury Lane Theatre on 12 March 1742, with the composer's wife Cecilia Young in the role of Venus.

It has an area of and is situated at a depth of below ground. History Construction of the facility began in 1951, in connection with the early threat of nuclear war with the United States. The underground complex was built using the same technique that was used in the construction of the Moscow Metro subway, to which it is connected by two tunnels. The first tunnel was used to supply the facility, and connects to the subway at Taganskaya (circle line) station. The second tunnel connects to the technical areas of Taganskaya.Archive chief engineer of the GO-42: Explanatory note to the reconstruction of the object CZ-293 Moscow, Metrogiprotrans, 1973 In 1956, the facility operated as an emergency command post headquarters of Moscow antiaircraft district (PVO) communication center. Personnel at the facility, including technical staff, were changed over every 24 hours. The staff worked in short shifts in order to stay alert and prevent combat anxiety. According to recollections of veterans, many of the staff members worked for various other institutions, including the central telegraph, radio studio, and geodetic laboratory. In the 1960s, the bunker was equipped with everything needed to continue operating in the event of a nuclear attack, including food, fuel, and two artesian wells to provide clean drinking water for an extended period of time. In the mid-1970s, it was decided to reconstruct part of the bunker to serve the needs of the central telegraph office. This was due to a backlog of maintenance issues in the complex, such as a lack of waterproofing, and aging diesel generators and ventilation systems. These plans were never carried out, however, and the bunker was declassified in 2000. The 2001 Russian federal budget earmarked one million rubles for capital investments in the site. =Transfer to private ownership= In 2006, the bunker was put up for public auction by the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management. It was purchased by a private company, Novick-Service, for 65 million rubles. Novick-Service plans to turn it into an entertainment complex with a museum of the Cold War, a restaurant, and possibly a spa. The only objects left unaltered are a massive steel door, and steel paneling in the bunker. As of April 2007, it is possible to book excursions around the 600-metre-long network of tunnels. As of March 2012, renovations were still in progress, but part of the bunker had been finished. Capacity Approximately 600 people could live and work in the complex for 30 days without assistance from the outside world, thanks to stores of food and medicine, an air recycling system, and diesel generators. Workers would commute to the facility by way of the Taganskaya metro station, on special trains that ran at night.

It is the eighth largest potash producer worldwide by volume of production and the sole Arab producer of potash. The Company was formed in 1956 in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan as a pan-Arab business venture and it has a 100-year concession (1958-2058) from the government of Jordan that grants it exclusive rights to extract, manufacture and market minerals from the Dead Sea. It is headquartered in Amman and has its main plants at Ghor Al Safi. The company's stock is listed on the Amman Stock Exchange's ASE Weighted Index. Operations The site of Arab Potash Company (APC) is located 110 kilometers south of Amman and 200 kilometers north of Aqaba. The site is basically a Solar Evaporation Ponds System of an area of 112 km2 and processing plants. APC produces four grades of potash: standard, fine, granular and industrial grade potash through the following process: * Solar Ponds: The process starts at the Brine Intake pumping station located on the Lisan peninsula where four intake pumps with a capacity of approximately 20 m3 per second deliver 250 - 300 million tons per year of Dead Sea water. The precipitated raw Carnallite is the raw material for producing potash is precipitated as mixture of Carnallite (KCl.MgCl2.6H2O) and NaCl. This bed is harvested as a slurry from beneath the brine and delivered to booster pumps on the dikes and then to the refinery through floating pipes. * Processing Plants: The Hot Leach Plant: APC utilizes the hot leach process technology to produce high grade standard and fine potash, which includes the following units of operation: Carnallite Processing; Sylvinite Processing; Crystallization; Product Dewatering; Drying; Screening * Industrial Potash Plant: Industrial grade Potash (KCl) is the premium form of Potassium Chloride (99.2% KCl min.) that is produced to meet the needs of the non-fertilizer sector. * Cold Crystallization Plant I: The cold crystallization plant is independent of the hot leach facility. It is operated under ambient temperature and therefore requires less energy. It includes the following processes: Carnallite Receiving; Flotation; Crystallization; Cold Leaching; Drying * Cold Crystallization Plant II: A second Cold Crystallization Plant (II) came into operation in September 2010 to give a total production of 450,000 tpy. The new plant is much similar to the Cold Crystallization Plant I, but it encompasses certain areas of modified processes and advanced technology. A new compaction plant was also installed to produce more than 250,000 tpy of high quality granular potash. The new compaction plant comprises a post-treatment unit to enhance the quality of granular potash. Markets APC's principal export markets are India, China and Malaysia. Subsidiaries and affiliates Arab Potash has several Dead Sea-area affiliates and subsidiary projects, including: *Arab Fertilizers & Chemicals Industries (KEMAPCO) Established in 1998, KEMAPCO is a limited liability company wholly owned by APC. KEMAPCO produces potassium nitrate fertilizer (of which it supplies around 12% of world's total demand), dicalcium phosphate, animal feed and nitric acid, for markets in Europe and Asia. *Numeira Mixed Salts and Mud Company is a limited liability company founded in 1997 and wholly owned by APC.

He was a part of the Frem teams that won the 1941 and 1944 Danish championship trophies, and was selected to represent Denmark at the 1948 Olympics. He scored two goals in four games as Denmark won bronze medals, and was one of several Danish footballers who was bought by professional Italian clubs after the Olympics had ended. He played his last Danish national team game in October 1948, as the Danish rules of amateurism prohibited him from representing his country as a professional player. In the same year 1948 he joined Juventus in the italian Serie A, after a quick 40 billions lire transfer.

Monks chant the suttas in Pali language overnight (continuously, without sleeping) in prelude to the gates of hell opening, an event that is presumed to occur once a year, and is linked to the cosmology of King Yama originating in the Pali Canon. During this period, the gates of hell are opened and manes of the ancestors are presumed to be especially active. In order to combat this, food-offerings are made to benefit them, some of them having the opportunity to end their period of purgation, whereas others are imagined to leave hell temporarily, to then return to endure more suffering; without much explanation, relatives who are not in hell (who are in heaven or otherwise reincarnated) are also generally imagined to benefit from the ceremonies. In temples adhering to canonical protocol, the offering of food itself is made from the laypeople to the (living) Buddhist monks, thus generating \\"merit\\" that indirectly benefits the dead;Recasting Reconciliation through Culture and the Arts, Ly Daravuth, Brandeis University however, in many temples, this is either accompanied by or superseded by food offerings that are imagined to directly transfer from the living to the dead, such as rice-balls thrown through the air, or rice thrown into an empty field.

Spiritually, it means that God brings Christians to new life or \\"born again\\" from a previous state of separation from God and subjection to the decay of death (Ephesians 2:5). Thus, in Lutheran and Roman Catholic theology, it generally means that which takes place during baptism. In Calvinism (Reformed theology) and Arminian theology, baptism is recognized as an outward sign of an inward reality which is to follow regeneration as a sign of obedience to the New Testament. While the exact Greek noun \\"rebirth\\" or \\"regeneration\\" () appears just twice in the New Testament (Matthew and Titus ), regeneration represents a wider theme of re-creation and spiritual rebirth. Furthermore, there is the sense in which regeneration includes the concept \\"being born again\\" (John and 1 Peter ). New Testament references In , Jesus refers to \\"the regeneration\\" (e.g. translations in the Geneva Bible, King James Version, and American Standard Version). The New International Version refers to \\"the renewal of all things\\" and the English Standard Version refers to \\"the new world\\". In the writer of the epistle refers to two aspects of the mercy which God has shown believers, \\"the washing of regeneration (i.e. baptism) and renewing of the Holy Spirit\\". Historical interpretations Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott notes the \\"wide range\\" of meaning: in Titus 3:5, \\"the word ... is applied to baptism, as the instrument of the regeneration or new birth of the individual believer\\", but \\"there is to be a 'new birth' for mankind as well as for the individual\\".Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers on Matthew 19, accessed 3 February 2017 However, much of the historical theological interpretation of \\"regeneration\\" has focused on individual renewal, as shown in the following theological schools of thought: =Baptismal regeneration= Lutheran and Roman Catholic theology holds that \\"baptism confers cleansing of [original] sin, the infusion of regenerating grace and union with Christ.\\" Official Roman Catholic teaching specifically states that regeneration commences with baptism. =General evangelicalism= During the period of the Great Awakening, emphasis in Protestant theology began to be placed on regeneration as the starting point of an individual's new life in Christ. =Pelagianism= Pelagius believed that people were born pure, with God's spirit already at work, making the need for spiritual regeneration from a previous sinful state irrelevant. Since Pelagius, modernist theology has seen regeneration as more a matter of education than spiritual renewal. =Semi-Pelagianism= Semipelagianism in its original form was developed as a compromise between Pelagianism and the teaching of Church Fathers such as Augustine, who taught that man cannot come to God without the grace of God. In Semipelagian thought a distinction is made between the beginning of faith and the increase of faith. Semi-Pelegianism holds that man must initiate of his own free will to receive grace. The first steps toward the Christian life are thus understood as acts of the human will with grace supervening afterward. =Calvinism and Reformed theology= Reformed theology teaches that regeneration precedes faith through the doctrine of Total depravity. Before regeneration a sinner is dead and until the sinner is regenerated and given a new nature, the sinner cannot believe. Reformed theology characteristically views baptism as an outward sign of God's internal work, as John Calvin stated: ‚Äúall who are clothed with the righteousness of Christ are at the same time regenerated by the Spirit, and that we have an earnest of this regeneration in baptism.‚Äù Regeneration is further described as the \\"secret operation of the Holy Spirit.\\" =Arminianism= In contrast to Semi-Pelagianism, Arminian theology teaches that the first steps are taken by God in the form of prevenient grace. Arminians differ from Calvinists in affirming that God's grace is resistible. \\"When our wills are freed, we can either accept God‚Äôs saving grace in faith or reject it to our own ruin.\\" When someone believes, it is not grace which makes one to differ from another person, but the freed response to exercise faith to accept that grace. According to Classical Arminians if a person is regenerated it is due to that person's response to grace with faith alone; if a person is rejected, it is due to that person's choice alone. Prevenient grace is appropriated or rejected before regeneration; those who do not reject it come into the light by grace in concert with their freed will operating synergistically. After a believer has under the influence of prevenient grace made the faithful decision to follow Christ, God regenerates them spiritually. In contrast to Calvinism, which teaches that regeneration is the decree of God, Arminianism teaches that a sinner must repent and place their faith in Christ as the condition to regeneration and, in this manner, regeneration is by faith, not by decree.

Troparil is a phenyltropane-based dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) that is derived from methylecgonidine. Troparil is a few times more potent than cocaine as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but is less potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and has a duration spanning a few times longer, since the phenyl ring is directly connected to the tropane ring through a non-hydrolyzable carbon-carbon bond. The lack of an ester linkage removes the local anesthetic action from the drug, so troparil is a pure stimulant. This change in activity also makes troparil slightly less cardiotoxic than cocaine. The most commonly used form of troparil is the tartrate salt, but the hydrochloride and naphthalenedisulfonate salts are also available, as well as the free base. Background The first known published synthesis of troparil and the related compound WIN 35428 is by Clarke and co-workers during the 1970s. Apparently, it was their intention to separate the stimulant actions of cocaine from its toxicity and dependence liability. Troparil is the only regular phenyltropane having a NET affinity that exceeds the DAT affinity. Application  Phenyltropanes are likely to have less abuse and dependency compared with cocaine. Troparil is used in scientific research into the dopamine reuptake transporter. 3H-radiolabelled forms of troparil have been used in humans and animals to map the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain. It is also used for animal research into stimulant drugs as an alternative to cocaine which produces similar effects, but avoids the stringent licensing requirements for the use of cocaine itself. Troparil has similar effects to cocaine in animal studies, but recreational use of this compound to date has proven extremely rare. Despite being easily made by the reaction of methylecgonidine with phenylmagnesium bromide, the relative scarcity of methylecgonidine and the demanding reaction conditions required for the synthesis put production of this compound beyond the capacity of most illicit drug manufacturers, and legitimate supplies of troparil are available only in very small quantities for a very high price.  Legality  The legal status of troparil is unclear, but it may be considered a controlled substance analog of cocaine in the United States on the grounds of its related chemical structure. The legal status of troparil and many other cocaine analogs in Canada, is dependent on if ecgonine, coca, or cocaine were derivatives of the compound, according to the wording on the entry of coca in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

It was founded by real estate pioneer Alfred Kaskel in 1962, with the name \\"Doral\\" coming from an amalgamation of the first names of Kaskel and his wife, Doris. It currently has 72 holes of golf and its signature course is the Blue Monster at Doral. Description The resort consists of .Trump's Doral and Jupiter resorts' tax bills under scrutiny: A Doral councilwoman is challenging Trump National Doral's tax assessment, The Real Deal (August 22, 2016). Prior to its renovation, the club was reported to feature \\"four golf courses; 700 hotel rooms across 10 lodges; more than of meeting space, including a ballroom; a spa with 33 treatment rooms; six food and beverage outlets; extensive retail; and a private members' clubhouse.\\"Trump buys Doral Resort for $150 million, plans 18-month renovation, PGA.com news services (February 28, 2012). History The Doral Country Club was built for $10 million by Carol Management, a New York-based real estate firm headed by Alfred Kaskel. The club opened in January 1962. The resort was the sister hotel to the famous Doral Hotel on the ocean in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1994, Carol Management sold a majority stake in the resort to KSL Recreation, a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts affiliate focused on premier golf facilities, for approximately $100 million. KSL was then purchased in 2004 by CNL Hospitality (later CNL Hotels & Resorts), a real estate investment trust affiliated with CNL Financial Group. CNL placed the resort under the management of Marriott International later that year. In 2007, CNL Hotels was acquired by the real estate arm of Morgan Stanley. Around 2010, the Pritikin Longevity Center moved into the spa area of the Doral resort.Amy Bertrand, Relax, refresh and get healthy at Florida's Pritikin Center, St. Louis Post- Dispatch (February 19, 2012). In 2011, a group of creditors led by Paulson & Co. took control of the Doral and seven other properties from Morgan Stanley. They quickly placed the Doral and four of the other properties under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and began seeking a buyer for the Doral. In February 2012, the Trump Organization purchased the Doral Resort & Spa out of bankruptcy for $150 million. The property's name was then changed to Trump National Doral. Trump began a $250-million renovation of the resort in 2013, which was completed in 2016. The purchase and renovation were financed with $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank. Trump's purchase included four of the five golf courses.Monique O. Madan, Donald Trump gets his key to Doral, Miami Herald (March 4, 2015). The fifth, the \\"Great White Course,\\" was excluded from the sale because of its high potential for redevelopment. Instead, it was sold, along with the other bankrupt properties, to GIC, a creditor in the case. GIC sold the course in 2016 for $96 million to two homebuilders, Lennar Homes and CC Homes. In May 2019 it was reported the resort was in \\"steep decline\\" financially, in which its net operating income had fallen by 69 percent ‚Äì from $13.8 million in 2015 to $4.3 million two years later. =Lawsuits and legal controversies= Trump \\"has been the target of dozens of liens\\" from contractors who worked on the renovation project. On May 20, 2016, a Miami-Dade County Circuit Court judge ordered Trump National Doral Miami to be foreclosed and sold on June 28 unless the Trump Organization paid $32,800 to a Miami paint supply company. A high portrait of Donald Trump painted by Miami Beach-based artist Havi Schanz, which became controversial when it was reported to be purchased for $10,000 with funds from the non- profit Trump Foundation, hangs on the wall in the resort's Champions Bar & Grill. Since Trump purchased the resort in 2012, he has challenged the local property tax assessments every year. In filings with the Federal Election Commission, Trump has consistently claimed high property values for his golf courses; in tax proceedings, however, Trump has generally claimed substantially lower values. In August 2016, Doral Councilwoman Sandra Ruiz challenged the tax assessment for the Doral resort, saying that it was too low and did not account for renovations that increased the value. In 2017, the resort settled a lawsuit from a guest whose back, face, and arms were bitten by bed bugs. In October 2019, amidst the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, the White House announced that the Doral will host the upcoming 46th G7 summit. Trump suggested that the resort would host the event \\"at cost\\" or perhaps at no cost to American taxpayer. The move prompted renewed criticism that Trump was self-dealing in violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler called the selection of Doral \\"among the most brazen examples yet of the President's corruption.\\" Lack of support from Trump's Republican allies who had grown weary of defending him led Trump to abandon his plans within days of the announcement. This was notable as it was a rare crack in the wall of Trump's Republican support. Golf courses and tournaments Trump National Doral Miami features four championship golf courses: * Blue Monster * Golden Palm * Red Tiger * Silver Fox The Blue Monster played host to the Doral Open on the PGA Tour from 1962 to 2006, and from 2007 to 2016 the WGC-Cadillac Championship made its home there after having been played at different venues in the United States and Europe since its inception in 1999. In 2016, it was announced that the tournament would be moved to Mexico City. The resort's other courses have also played host to important events. The Golden Palm hosted the PGA Tour's Qualifying Tournament in 1999 and since 2018 hosts the PGA Tour Latinoam√©rica Tour Championship, and the Red Tiger hosted The Office Depot on the LPGA Tour in 2000. The Latinoam√©rica Tour Championship was moved in October 2018 after plans to demolish host course Melreese Country Club to build a new football pitch for Club Internacional de F√∫tbol Miami were announced. The property was formerly home of The Jim McLean Golf School. The school relocated to the Miami Biltmore Hotel in 2018. Trump National Doral Miami was featured in Golf magazine's Top 100 resorts in 2019, celebrating the best places in golf to stay and play.

Finland‚Äôs place names range from those of unknown or unrecognizable origins to more clearly derivable onomastics. There are both national and international recommendations on how to use the bilingual country's place names in texts written in different languages. In Finland, the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland and the National Land Survey of Finland are jointly responsible for the standardization of place names. Historical aspects A few notable place names ‚Äì such as a few major hydronyms P√§ij√§nne, Saimaa, Imatra and Keitele which are thought to be among the oldest toponyms ‚Äì still lack a sound derivation from existing languages despite of different approaches. This has led to the postulation that they may originate from an unknown language.Article in Finnish A substratum of archaic Sami place names, often fennicized in the course of time, can be found throughout the country. page 9 The majority of Finland‚Äôs toponyms can be recognized having archaic or dialectal Finnish origins. A Finnish substratum can be deduced in Swedish place names and vice versa in many cases. Major urbanisation started and city rights were granted in Finland when the country was part of Sweden in a situation where Swedish was the de facto only official language though the majority always spoke Finnish dialects as a first language. Therefore, in older foreign writing, many municipal and city names are given only in their Swedish form. Other substrata in Finland‚Äôs toponyms include Finnic, Baltic, Germanic and Slavic linguistic influence in several chronological layers. Jurisdiction regarding languages in Finland Finland, except for the √Öland islands, has two official languages: Finnish and Swedish. The √Öland islands have a single official language: Swedish. On the mainland, Swedish-speakers are concentrated to the regions Ostrobothnia, Uusimaa and around Turku. North Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami are semi-official in the Sami Domicile Area. The Language Act of 2003 groups municipalities into three groups: monolingually Finnish, monolingually Swedish and bilingual. The municipality is monolingual, if it has less than 8% of the minority language speakers and if the population of the lingual minority in the municipality is below 3,000. Other communities are bilingual.Kielilaki (423/2003) 5 ¬ß. Retrieved 3-8-2007. In bilingual municipalities, the Language Act requires that all toponyms have both a Finnish and a Swedish name. In addition, many monolingually Finnish municipalities have an official Swedish name, and vice versa. The municipalities have the power to decide their own name but they are required to consult with the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland before the official decision.Kuntalaki (365/1995) 5 ¬ß. Retrieved 3-8-2007. Conventions These are the current conventions recommended by the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. The conventions have also been adopted by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names:TOPONYMIC GUIDELINES FOR MAP EDITORS AND OTHER EDITORS, FINLAND, (v. 4.2, 28 February 2006) *Finnish place names are used in the Finnic languages (such as Finnish and Estonian). Swedish place names are used in the North Germanic languages (such as Swedish and Norwegian). Sami place names are used in the different Sami languages around northern Fennoscandia. *In other languages, if that language doesn‚Äôt already have an established toponym for the place (very seldom), the choice between Finnish and Swedish toponyms is based on the demographic situation. Finnish place names are used when handling a municipality where Finnish is the majority language (90% of all municipalities,389 out of 431 93% of the cities106 out of 114). Swedish place naming is used when handling a municipality where Swedish is the majority language. Concerning the Sami Homeland, toponyms are written in Finnish and appended with the Sami place names. The convention concerning street names and traffic signs maintains that the majority language toponym is presented topmost and place names in the minority languages are listed below. =Possible deviations in the conventions= A few exonyms (in Medieval or Neo-Latin, not in use in Finland or Sweden) exist for Finland‚Äôs provincial structures. These include the names of the nine historical provinces (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap) that have given names to some of Finland‚Äôs current regions (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap, altogether 20 as of 1997). These may fall under the category of \\"already established place names in foreign languages\\" mentioned in the above recommendations.

Lappi fi; Lappland sv; Lapland en :9. √Öland sv, en; Ahvenanmaa fi =Guidelines for naming new places= In urban planning, new names are needed for different places. Suburbs, streets, parks and other areas must be named. In bilingual municipalities, the task is complicated by the need to use two different languages in the toponyms. As all municipalities in the Finnish capital region, which is the most swiftly developing area in Finland, are bilingual, the problem of devising good toponyms is not a small task. The Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has given guidelines for devising new toponyms. The basic principle is to use toponyms already in use and spell them according to the modern language norms. As the old toponym for a minor place, such as a field, often exist only in one language, they should be translated with care. Only such names which carry an identifiable meaning should be translated directly. If the toponym already exists in both languages, the existing forms should be used. If the translation of the name is unfeasible and there exists no toponym in the other language, then the toponym should be loaned in its original form. Personal names should not be translated. However, if the existing name is unusable in the other language for phonetic or grammatical reasons, a new name may be freely invented.Nimist√∂nsuunnittelu i.e. plan for naming. Retrieved 2015 The cases where two municipalities are fused together, create a special case for the construction of toponyms. There are two simple cases for the name selection: *smaller municipalities joining a city: the name of the city should be used *municipalities which have been chapel parishes joining the municipality which has been the mother parish: the name of the historical mother parish should be used.Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus. Yhdistyvien kuntien nimet. 7-12-2006. Retrieved 3-8-2007 In other cases, the toponym should be selected from the historical toponyms of the area. In many cases, there are historical administrative structures that have encompassed the area of the merging municipalities. If such names are unusable, the name of some the most prominent villages in the area should be used. To reduce the possibility of confusion, the new name should not include the name of the province or the region. In no case should the name be made up of two parts, because the use of such name is grammatically difficult in Finnish language. The names of the merger projects or frivolous names should also be avoided at all costs. If the merging municipalities will form a bilingual municipality, the Finnish name chosen for the municipality should be such that a Swedish counterpart can be found without difficulty. The Swedish name of the new municipality should be devised according to the same principles as in other toponymical planning. =Finnish Grammar= In Finnish grammar, some toponyms receive external locative suffixes, especially those named for bodies of water, as in (river and town Sein√§joki) Sein√§joella (either on river Sein√§joki or in town Sein√§joki. Case of being in or under the river being Sein√§joessa). The rest receive internal locative suffixes, as in Helsingiss√§ (being inflected form of the town, meaning: in Helsinki).Examples of inflections of location names in Finnish and in Swedish (noted as \\"ruots.\\") where applicable See also * Names of places in Finland in Finnish and in Swedish  References and notes  Finland Toponymy Toponymy Toponymy Toponymy Category:Place name etymologies Category:Names of places in Finland ","title":"Toponyms of Finland"},{"id":"10794325","text":"7th & Capitol (southbound) and 8th & Capitol (northbound) is a split Sacramento Regional Transit District light rail station, served by all three RT light rail lines: Blue, Gold and Green.

The Houston Chronicle, Friday, July 2, 2010 In late June 2010, the Democratic Party of Texas sued to block certification of Green Party candidates, claiming that illegal out-of-state corporate donations had funded the party's petition drive to get on the Texas ballot. District Judge John Dietz agreed and issued an order blocking the Green Party from certifying its candidates, citing the limitations of Texas laws on the use of corporate money, that it could only be used for routine and convention expenses, not for ballot petitioning. But on July 2, 2010, the Texas State Supreme Court lifted the lower court order blocking the party, and the Texas Green Party certified four candidates for the general election. Swift responded to Democrats' claims by explaining that the effort was not just about the governor's race, and that the party is running statewide candidates for the purpose of meeting state requirements to gain ballot status in order to run viable candidates for local offices.

Born in Leicester, England, James' career in basketball started out as a player for his hometown team Leicester All-Stars. He made his league debut on 26 September 1981, just weeks after his 17th birthday, against local rivals Nottingham. He enjoyed seven successful years at the All-Stars (now known as Riders) before moving south to sign for Bracknell Tigers in 1988. After nine years as a player, James was then promoted head coach of the Tigers in 1997, a position he retained until 2005 when the franchise was pulled from the league. However, he was soon offered the coaching position of Guildford Heat, a club established by fans of the former Tigers to take their place in the BBL. In just two seasons, James led the new franchise to fifth place in their rookie season and a League and Cup double in 2007, an achievement for the club, for which he was awarded BBL Coach of the Year 2007. The proceeding season saw James lead the Heat into its first European adventure, competing in the ULEB Cup, however a disappointing campaign finished 0-10 in a Group that contained the likes of DKV Joventut, Alba Berlin and BC ≈†iauliai. The 2008-2009 season was one of financial struggle for Guildford, and as a cost-cutting measure confirmed that James's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season.

Published in 1802, it tells the story of a 14th-century attempt by the Abbot of Aberbrothok (\\"Aberbrothock\\") to install a warning bell on Inchcape, a notorious sandstone reef about off the east coast of Scotland. The poem tells how the bell was removed by a pirate, who subsequently perished on the reef while returning to Scotland in bad weather some time later. Like many of Southey's ballads \\"The Inchcape Rock\\" describes a supernatural event, but its basic theme is that those who do bad things will ultimately be punished accordingly and poetic justice done. Biographical background and publication Bell Rock Lighthouse was built on the Inchcape reef in the early 19th century, and is named after the legend of the Abbot's bell Southey wrote the poem between 1796 and 1798 for The Morning Post, but it was not published until 1802. His inspiration was the legend of a pirate who removed a bell on Inchcape placed there by the Abbot of Arbroath to warn mariners of the reef. The poem was reprinted in the Edinburgh Annual Register for 1810, published in 1812. In a letter to his maternal uncle Herbert Hill, dated 16 August 1812, Southey tells how \\"The Inchcape Rock\\" had \\"lain uncorrected among my papers for the last ten years\\", until \\"some unknown person ... thought proper to touch [it] up & transmit [it] for insertion\\". The poem is included in the third volume of Southey's The Poetical Works of Robert Southey (1823), volume 3, where it is prefaced by a quotation from John Stoddart's Remarks on Local Scenery and Manners in Scotland (1801), which begins \\"An old writer mentions a curious tradition that may be worth quoting\\" before going on to the relate the tale. Southey added a footnote suggesting that his own source may have been a Brief Description of Scotland (1633), written by someone identified only as Poem The poem consists of 17 quatrains written in rhyming couplets. It begins by describing how the bell installed by the abbot was attached to a buoy, so it only rang when the Inchcape Rock was under water and the buoy was floating. :The holy Abbot of Aberbrothok :Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock; :On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung, :And over the waves its warning rung. :When the Rock was hid by the surge‚Äôs swell, :The Mariners heard the warning Bell; :And then they knew the perilous Rock, :And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok The bell is cut down by a pirate known as Sir Ralph the Rover and dropped into the sea, for reasons the poem does not explain. After its removal Ralph says, \\"The next who comes to the Rock, Won‚Äôt bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok\\". Some time later Ralph's own ship founders on the rock while he is attempting to negotiate his way back to Scotland in bad weather, laden with booty. In classic 19th-century Romantic style, the ship sinks dramatically as Ralph hears the Devil summoning him to Hell by ringing the bell he had removed: :Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair, :He curst himself in his despair; :The waves rush in on every side, :The ship is sinking beneath the tide. :But even in his dying fear, :One dreadful sound could the Rover hear; :A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell, :The Devil below was ringing his knell. Themes Many of Southey's ballads describe supernatural events, and The Inchcape Rock is no exception. Bernhardt-Kabisch has argued that Southey's supernatural ballads \\"seemed purposed to objectify Southey's demons and to exorcise them by ridicule\\". The poem's basic theme is that bad things happen to those who do bad things. In 1851, while discussing a plan to place bells across the country to help lost shepherds, Thomas De Quincey suggested that \\"The Inchcape Rock\\" should be used to discourage those who might seek to destroy the warning bells: \\"And every child might learn to fear a judgment of retribution upon its own steps in case of any such wicked action, by reading the tale of him, who, in order 'To plague the Abbot of Aberbrothock,' removed the bell from the Inchcape rock.\\" Critical reception Writing in 1873 Joseph Devey expressed his view that in this poem \\"Having small canvas for his picture, Southey at once seizes upon the salient features of the subject, and discards the fatal prolixity which mars most of his heavier productions. The 'Maid of the Inn,' the 'Well of St. Keyne,' the 'Battle of Blenheim,' the 'Inchcape Rock,' place Southey at the head of the ballad, while his 'Madoc' and his 'Roderic' place him very nearly at the tail of the epic poets of his country.\\" \\"The Inchcape Rock\\" is included in the 10-volume The World's Best Poetry collection edited by Bliss Carman and others, published in 1904. In his 1947 English translation of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, J. M. Cohen refers to \\"The Inchcape Rock\\" as having a style he wishes to avoid in his rendering of the ballads by Cervantes. Legacy There was no warning device on Inchcape Rock in modern times until 1810, when Robert Stevenson and John Rennie completed construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, but Southey's poem popularised the legend of the bell.

As of 2000, it is the largest contiguous forest on the Delmarva Peninsula. Located at , it is one of the northernmost of the Bald Cypress swamps common in the southeastern United States (Battle Creek Cypress Swamp in Calvert County, Maryland is slightly further north, but much smaller). It covers about , mostly in southern Sussex County, Delaware. It is the source of the Pocomoke River, which flows south, and Pepper Creek, which flows northeast. History The swamp once yielded much cypress timber. Through overharvesting and a disastrous peat fire in 1930, much of its vegetation was destroyed. One of the fires burned for eight months, leading it to be deemed the \\"Burnt Swamp\\" by local residents. In 1980, Senator Joe Biden, at the request of environmentalists, proposed that the swamp be made into a National Park; this plan was met with resistance from local residents concerned of being overwhelmed with large numbers of visitors. When Senator Tom Carper revisited the idea of creating a national park in Delaware in 2004, the Cypress Swamp was not considered because of these concerns. The non-profit organization Delaware Wild Lands manages the swamp and has undertaken efforts to replant bald cypress trees there. Ecological value =Birds= The swamp is home to 73 breeding species of birds. The most abundant species in the swamp are the worm-eating warbler and brown-headed cowbird. The swamp also contains two regionally rare species, Swainson's warbler and black-throated green warbler. eBird has records of at least 94 species observed in the swamp, including some found during migration which do not breed there.

The expression of this receptor in human B cells has been a controversial topic and to date there is no consensus regarding the role of this receptor as a marker of human B cells. B-1 cells have limited diversity of their B-cell receptor due to their lack of the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and are potentially self-reactive. CD5 serves to mitigate activating signals from the BCR so that the B-1 cells can only be activated by very strong stimuli (such as bacterial proteins) and not by normal tissue proteins. CD5 was used as a T-cell marker until monoclonal antibodies against CD3 were developed. In humans, the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11. There is no confirmed ligand for CD5 but there is evidence that CD72, a C-type lectin, may be a ligand or that CD5 may be homophilic, binding CD5 on the surface of other cells. CD5 includes a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein domain. T cells express higher levels of CD5 than B cells. CD5 is upregulated on T cells upon strong activation. In the thymus, there is a correlation with CD5 expression and strength of the interaction of the T cell towards self-peptides. Immunohistochemistry CD5 is a good immunohistochemical marker for T-cells, although not as sensitive as CD3. About 76% of T-cell neoplasms are reported to express CD5, and it is also found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (both being B cell malignancies), that do not express CD3. It is commonly lost in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and its absence can be used as an indicator of malignancy in this condition. The absence of CD5 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while relatively rare, is associated with a poor prognosis.

On 30 March 2011, Cambodian king Norodom Sihamoni granted her the title Kittipritbandit (Khmer: ·ûÄ·û∑·ûè·üí·ûè·û∑·ûñ·üí·ûö·ûπ·ûë·üí·ûí·ûî·ûé·üí·ûå·û∑·ûè), a title meaning roughly \\"Celebrated Senior Sage/Scholar/PhD\\" and equivalent to an honorary Doctorate in the Royal Academy of Cambodia. On 8 May 2013, King Sihamoni awarded her the title Samdech (Khmer: ·ûü·ûò·üí·ûä·üÅ·ûÖ), the highest bestowed title in the Khmer kingdom, thus making her full title Samdech Kittipritbandit Bun Rany Hun Sen (Khmer: ·ûü·ûò·üí·ûä·üÅ·ûÖ·ûÄ·û∑·ûè·üí·ûè·û∑·ûñ·üí·ûö·ûπ·ûë·üí·ûí·ûî·ûé·üí·ûå·û∑·ûè·ûî·üä·ûª·ûì ·ûö·üâ·û∂·ûì·û∏ ·û†·üä·ûª·ûì ·ûü·üÇ·ûì). Although she should technically be addressed as Samdech, she is often informally referenced as Lok Chumtiew. Early life Bun Rany was born Bun Sam Hieng to a Chinese-Khmer family in what was then the province of Kampong Cham, Cambodia in Roka Khnao, Krouch Chhmar District (now a part of Tbong Khmum Province). Her parents, Lin Kri and Bun Sieng Ly, were prosperous farmers who traced their ancestry to Kwangtung (Guangdong) in China. Rany has two brothers and three sisters. As children, before the Cambodian Civil War, they all walked half an hour to school, wading across the Roka Khnao River in the dry season or hitching a ferry ride across in the wet season when the water was too deep to cross. She has stated that her maternal grandparents' gentle instruction in Cambodian tradition was very influential in her later life. In 1970, when Rany was 16 years old, her grandparents died. Shortly thereafter, Prince Sihanouk was deposed by General Lon Nol. These two events deeply affected her and when the exiled Prince aligned with the Communist Khmer Rouge and issued a call for Cambodians to fight against Lon Nol's government, Rany secretly joined the National United Front of Kampuchea. The local cadres gave her a choice of positions. She chose the medical field and the leadership arranged for her training by doctors who had come from Phnom Penh to lecture fresh recruits. After six months of Khmer Rouge training, she was sent back to Krouch Chhmar with the title of Public Health Officer. By 1974, she was the director of a Khmer Rouge hospital located approximately 50 km from the front line of fighting against Lon Nol's Khmer Republic government forces. Marriage to Hun Sen In March 1974, Rany met Hun Sen (through Le Duc Tho) who, having joined the Khmer Rouge in 1970, commanded most of the soldiers that were treated at her hospital. As the Khmer Rouge leadership forbade fraternization among the people and strictly controlled every facet of life, including courtship and marriage, they carried on a romance through intermediaries and occasionally on the pretense of official Party business. Hun Sen officially requested the Angkar to allow a marriage in late 1974 but despite his reputation as a good leader, was told to wait until Phnom Penh was captured and the whole country was under Khmer Rouge rule. In 1975, one day before the fall of Phnom Penh, Hun Sen was hit by shrapnel and lost his left eye. Considering him now to be disabled, Bun Rany's superiors decided he was not suitable for marriage and instead attempted to arrange for her to marry a series of prominent men in Krouch Chhmar District, all of whom she rejected. Likewise, Hun Sen's superiors attempted to find a \\"more suitable\\" partner for him, suggesting, among others, a high-ranking Party woman twelve years his senior. Their refusal to follow the orders of their superiors led to lowered esteem and suspicion of loyalties. In early 1976, the Angkar organized a group marriage ceremony with twelve wounded and handicapped soldiers and notified Hun Sen and Bun Rany that they could marry as part of this event. The group wedding took place with little ceremony in a very remote location with no family members in attendance. They were told to live in Memot District where Hun Sen was stationed on the border with Vietnam while Rany was assigned to work long hours in neighbouring Ponhea Kraek and Tboung Khmum districts. On 10 November 1976, Bun Rany gave birth to their first child in Memot, a son whom they named Kamsot (meaning \\"sad\\") that died later the same day as a result of being dropped by a Khmer Rouge nurse, Rany claims. Currently Hun Sen and Rany have six children, four sons (one of them deceased) and three daughters (one of them adopted). Their names are Komsot (deceased), Manet, Mana, Manit, Mani, Mali and Malis. Activities as First Lady Bun Rany accompanies First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama during a visit to Siem Reap Province on 21 March 2015. In 1977, the Khmer Rouge began internal purges directed at those suspected of disloyalty. Hun Sen, who had risen to the rank of Battalion Commander, became paranoid and fled with his followers into Vietnam where they joined a rebel army and replacement government organized by the Vietnamese in advance of its effort to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime. Bun Rany, who was left behind, was imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge and would not see her husband again until almost two years later when the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1979. Upon defeating the Khmer Rouge and occupying Cambodia, the Vietnamese named Hun Sen as Deputy Prime Minister and freed Bun Rany who then began organizing orphanages and schools for the orphans left behind by the genocidal policies of the Khmer Rouge. In 1985, Hun Sen was appointed Prime Minister, giving Bun Rany a better platform to expand both her economic activities and her humanitarian work. During the post-1988 process of Thai-Cambodian rapprochement, she forged a close personal relationship with the wife of Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, and became deeply involved in the rapidly growing legal and illegal trade between Cambodia and Thailand.Bal√°zs Szalontai, From Battlefield into Marketplace: The End of the Cold War in Indochina, 1985-9. In: Artemy Kalinovsky and Sergey Radchenko (eds.), The End of the Cold War in the Third World. New Perspectives on Regional Conflict (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 164. From her position as first lady, she began to call attention to the plight of those infected with HIV/AIDS, the poor and women's issues. In April 1994 at the first congress of the Cambodian Red Cross, she was elected as its Vice President while Princess Eng Marie, wife of then Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh was elected President. At its second congress in 1998, Bun Rany was elected President after Hun Sen consolidated his power by violently ousting and exiling Ranariddh. Some of the highlights of her tenure thus far have been the establishment of five development centers located throughout Cambodia aimed at providing vocational and business training to women and the poor, organizing and delivering aid to victims of floods that regularly inundate Cambodia (2000, 2011 and 2013, among others) and efforts supporting the UN Secretary-General's Action Plan for Women and Children's Health.

For instance, in 2003 Noranarith Anandayath, adviser to Prince Ranariddh, accused her of politicizing the Red Cross, a worldwide organization whose reputation is founded on its political neutrality, by funneling money from her husband's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to villagers during an election when parties were prohibited from \\"making gifts\\" to voters. In October 2013 critics including Prince Sisowath Thomico and Sam Rainsy accused her of abusing her position when, at a Cambodian Red Cross flood relief event in Pailin, she spent the majority of her speech denouncing the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in the wake of a controversial national election that spawned some of the biggest protests Cambodia has seen in decades. In October 1999, following the public assassination of popular Cambodian actress Pisith Pilika, the French magazine L‚ÄôExpress claimed that the actress‚Äô diary recounted a love affair with Hun Sen and named Bun Rany as the mastermind behind the shooting; the magazine also claimed that on her deathbed the actress had named Bun Rany to several people. Bun Rany quickly denied these charges, and announced that she would press charges against L‚ÄôExpress for defamation.Marston, John (2000) ‚ÄúCamboya.‚Äù Asia Pac√≠fico No. 7, pp. 138-168. available at http://ceaa.colmex.mx/profesores/paginamarston/imagenespaginamarston/ap00.htm However, no charges were ever brought against L'Express.

Masanobu And≈ç and Ren Osugi play supporting roles, and Tsukamoto himself plays the unnamed villain. The film is shot entirely within Adachi, Tokyo. Nightmare Detective 2 was released in 2008. Matsuda returns in the lead role of Kagenuma. Hitomi declined to reprise her role.CinemaCafe.net Nightmare Detective ‚Ö° article Plot The film opens with a middle-aged man drinking beer, when a young man Kyoichi Kagenuma (Ryuhei Matsuda) appears from under the floor, and it is revealed that the older man, Mitake, is a former teacher of Kagenuma's father. Kagenuma is being haunted by the soul of a daughter whom his wife had aborted without his knowledge. Mitake refuses to help him. Kagenuma wakes up in hospital next to the body of Mitake, and surrounded by Mitake's children. Kagenuma had been in Mitake's dream, to find out who should inherit his property, but cannot answer. As he leaves, Kagenuma telepathically hears the selfish thoughts of Mitake's children, and realises that a messy legal battle is about to commence. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Keiko Kirishima (Hitomi) has recently switched from the National Police Academy to a district police station. Her new colleagues, Detective Ishida (Ren Osugi) and Detective Wakamiya (Masanobu And≈ç) do not understand her, and are somewhat resentful of her qualifications. Her own prickly personality does not help matters; she interprets their casualness at crime scenes as a lack of professionalism. She is unable to stomach the gruesome scene at her first case, so Ishida mocks her. Her first case is a young woman who has been found dead in her apartment, horribly slashed with a blade placed in her own hand. The fact that the apartment was locked from the inside convinces Ishida and Wakamiya that the case is a suicide; Kirishima is not so sure, as no note was left and a neighbour heard the victim crying out for help. Later, Kirishima's team is confronted by a similar case. A wife saw her husband slash himself to death while asleep in their bed. Kirishima discovers a link between the two unrelated victims; both had last dialled the same number, a sequence not registered anywhere in the country. The recording of both conversations reveals a young woman saying \\"help me\\" over and over again. It is suspected that some form of hypnotic suggestion was used. Because of the strange nature of the cases, the chief of the division separates the investigators into two groups. One, led by Detective Ishida, is to carry out 'the standard procedure', while the other, led by both Lieutenant Kirishima and Detective Wakamiya, is to investigate supernatural causes for the murders. This frustrates the rationalistic Kirishima. She and Wakamiya are directed to Kagenuma, who is described as a person with the power to enter dreams. However, Kagenuma is very unwilling to help, because he does not like to use his power. In fact, he had just tried to kill himself, but kids from the neighborhood saved him. The police leave him, and Kirishima suggests calling the mysterious number. In the end Wakiyama makes contact, but Kirishima seems to know something is wrong. Soon after Wakiyama is attacked while asleep. Kirishima again asks the Nightmare detective to intervene. Wakamiya has fallen asleep on the couch in the police station. Kagenuma, now with confidence, finally enters Wakiyama's dream and confronts O. Wakiyama is killed and Kagenuma ends up injured. He want to escape, but Kirishima forces his hand by calling O herself. So he must enter her dream, or let her die. He reluctantly decides to try to save her. Meanwhile, the other squad is getting close to O in the real world. As Kirishima is close to sleep, she speaks with O, wanting to know how he's able to go into minds. O reveals that he originally wanted to die alongside the first victim, but instead somehow crawled into her mind, feeling a rush and hunger to kill her. Wanting to feel the rush again, he continued to kill other people. In the dream, Kirishima is chased around a derelict school, ultimately being confronted by her inner self, who berates her for her weakness. Eventually, O chases her into an old furnace, trapping her before being attacked by Kagenuma. Kagenuma unlocks a repressed memory of O, revealing that, as a child, his teacher locked him in the same furnace Kirishima is in, alongside his sister who is killed when trying to escape.

Ralph began his career at Floreat Park in the WA Amateur Football League. He then played two seasons in the country with Dalwallinu before returning to Floreat, where he also had a considerable reputation in the local cricket competition as a fast bowler before dedicating himself solely to football in 1979.Where Are They Now: Warren Ralph He debuted for Claremont's league team in 1980 and showed himself to be an extremely potent full-forward in dry conditions: against Perth and Subiaco he kicked totals of 11.6 (72).Hopkins, Colin; \\"Melville Will Be Hand in Finals\\"; The West Australian, 25 August 1980, p. 96 His performance for the Tigers in wet conditions, against South Fremantle and East Fremantle, suggested that Ralph had limitations. He nevertheless kicked 87 goals and finished with the second highest tally of goals in the WAFL (behind Simon Beasley of Swan Districts). 1981 saw Claremont set numerous scoring records and Ralph emerge as the most potent spearhead in the league with 127 goals for the season,Claremont Football Club: Individual Honors a feat he repeated in 1982 with 115 goals and 1983 with 128 ‚Äì the highest tally in the WA(N)FL since Austin Robertson's 1968 record. During this period Ralph played interstate football for WA six times and averaged more than three goals a match.Warren Ralph at Blueseum He also played in Claremont's 1981 premiership team, in which he kicked three goals, and in their 1982 and 1983 losing Grand Final teams against Swan Districts. Ralph made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 1 of the 1984 season in the second biggest victory the Blues have ever managed, against 1983 minor premiers North Melbourne. He kicked nine goals in a score of 31.13 (199), and after seven matches had kicked 35 goals; however for the rest of his three seasons at Carlton injuries and effective strategies by opposing coaches led to him alternating between the seniors and reserves. Nonetheless, Ralph played a sensation game at VFL Park in the 1984 Qualifying Final, where he kicked eight of Carlton's fourteen goals. A knee injury disrupted him early in the 1985 season, and it was not until late in 1986 that Ralph showed any approach to his early promise, kicking twelve goals in the last two home-and-away games against Footscray and Melbourne. However, a poor performance in the Qualifying Final against the Swans saw him play in the Blues' reserves premiership team. However, Ralph soon had a falling-out with coach Robert Walls and possible clearances to Fitzroy and North Melbourne (for whom Claremont teammates Jimmy and Phil Krakouer played) were refused. Consequently, Ralph returned to Claremont, where in more suitable conditions he showed he had not lost his old touch, playing an important role in Claremont's all-conquering 1987 season with 75 goals including ten in the second semi against Subiaco, equalling Darren Bennett's record from the previous season.^ Atkinson, Graeme and Hanlon, Michael; 3AW Book of Footy Records: All the Great Players, Matches, Goals, Kicks, Brawls and Sensations from More Than 100 Years of Aussie Rules in Australia; p. 138. Ralph played briefly with Glenelg in 1988 and returned to Claremont the following season, playing his last match in the Grand Final. Just prior to his first game with Glenelg, Ralph won over $880,000 in the X-Lotto lottery. Ironically, he joined Glenelg after refusing to take a 60% pay cut from Claremont, with his two-year contract at Glenelg being $40,000.

Blowing snow can come from falling snow or snow that already accumulated on the ground but is picked up and blown about by strong winds. It is one of the classic requirements for a blizzard. Its METAR code is BLSN. If the snow remains below , it will be called drifting snow (METAR code DRSN). The snow which is being blown about may deposit as snowdrifts. Formation Visibility reduced in blowing snow during a ground blizzard There are 3 ways of producing blowing snow: # In horizontal advection conditions, the winds blow across the surface of the earth with very little if any large-scale upward motion. # In convection conditions, the winds exhibit large-scale upward motion lifting the snow into the atmosphere creating drifting waves of snow up to in height. # In thermal-mechanical mixing conditions, massive convective rolls form in the atmosphere and the blizzard may be observed from space with the blizzards convective rolls creating waves of snow (also known as snow billows) resembling lake or ocean effect snow bands.

From a prominent farming family in the small Western Australian wheatbelt community of Kukerin, Ditchburn moved to Perth in the mid-1970s, where he played WANFL football for Claremont. Between 1975 and 1980, Ditchburn played a total of 110 senior games for Claremont as a forward. He left the league at the end of 1980, and returned to work at the family farm in Kukerin. During the 1981 season, he served as captain-coach of the Kukerin Football Club in the Central Great Southern Football League. Ditchburn had been signed by the VFL's Carlton Football Club during the 1970s, tying him to the club if he ever chose to move to Victoria. At age 25 he decided he needed to make the attempt at VFL football in 1982 before he became too old to have a reasonable chance at it. He initially struggled; by Round 14, he had played only one senior game for one goal, and was considered too slow to play his preferred position of centre half forward in the VFL. He was nearly cleared back to Western Australia at mid-season, but was instead moved to full-forward where he had much greater success. In Round 16, his third senior VFL game, he kicked twelve goals from full-forward, and was able to cement a regular place in the team for the rest of the season. He kicked a total of 61 goals in only thirteen senior games for the year to be Carlton's leading goalkicker, and he was a member of the club's 1982 VFL Grand Final winning side having been knocked unconscious during the game. He played one further season for the Blues, kicking 30 goals in 15 games, to finish his brief VFL career with 28 games and 91 goals. Ditchburn returned to Kukerin after the 1983 season, in large part because his father was becoming ill, and he resumed his place on the family farm where he has continued to work since. He also continued to play football for Kukerin and post-merger club Kukerin-Dumbleyung for many years. He became heavily involved in the local community later in his life as a Shire of Dumbleyung councillor and deputy president.

It refers to the idea that one's understanding of the text as a whole is established by reference to the individual parts and one's understanding of each individual part by reference to the whole. Neither the whole text nor any individual part can be understood without reference to one another, and hence, it is a circle. However, this circular character of interpretation does not make it impossible to interpret a text; rather, it stresses that the meaning of a text must be found within its cultural, historical, and literary context. History St. Augustine of Hippo was the first philosopher and theologian to have introduced the hermeneutic cycle of faith and reason (in Latin: credo ut intellegam and intellego ut credam). The circle was conceived to improve the Biblical exegesis and it was activated by the personal belief in the truthfulness of God. According to the Confessions, misleding verses of the Bible shall be read at the light of the Holy Spirit God and in the context of \\"the spirit of the Bible as a whole\\", intended as a unique and non contradictory text divinely inspired. Friedrich Schleiermacher's approach to interpretation focuses on the importance of the interpreter understanding the text as a necessary stage to interpreting it. Understanding involved repeated circular movements between the parts and the whole. Hence the idea of an interpretive or hermeneutic circle. Understanding the meaning of a text is not about decoding the author's intentions.Intentionalism, however, does not necessarily exclude an embrace of the notion of the hermeneutic circle, as S√∏ren Harnow Klausen shows in \\"Levels of Literary Meaning,\\" Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 1 (April 2017): 70-90. \\"I conclude, almost to my own surprise, that something like the traditional idea of the hermeneutic circle is indispensable. We must work back and forth among intentions of lower and higher order, assigning to them varying relative weights as we go along, striving for some kind of balance, coherence, or overall appropriateness that cannot, however, be defined in advance or analyzed in terms of more basic principles. It is about establishing real relationships between reader, text, and context.\\"Ramberg, Bj√∏rn and Kristin Gjesdal, \\"Hermeneutics: Continuations\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2003, 2005. Even reading a sentence involves these repeated circular movements through a hierarchy of parts‚Äìwhole relationships. Thus, as we are reading this sentence, you are analysing single words as the text unfolds, but you are also weighing the meaning of each word against our changing sense of the overall meaning of the sentence you are reading, or perhaps misunderstanding, or maybe this sentence is reminding you of, or clashing with, another view about interpretation you have, in the past, advocated or disparaged. Hence we are brought to the sentence's larger historical context, depending on its location, and our own circumstances. Wilhelm Dilthey used the example of understanding a sentence as an example of the circular course of hermeneutic understanding. He particularly stressed that meaning and meaningfulness were always contextual. Thus the meaning of any sentence cannot be fully interpreted unless we know the historical circumstances of its utterance. And this means that interpretation is always linked to the situation of the interpreter, because one can only construct a history from the particular set of circumstances in which one currently exists. Thus Dilthey says: \\"Meaningfulness fundamentally grows out of a relation of part to whole that is grounded in the nature of living experience.\\" For Dilthey, \\"Meaning is not subjective; it is not projection of thought or thinking onto the object; it is a perception of a real relationship within a nexus prior to the subject-object separation in thought.\\"Heidegger, Martin. \\"The Origin of the Work of Art.\\" Poetry, Language, Thought. Trans. Albert Hofstadter. NY: Harper Collins, 1971. Martin Heidegger (1927) developed the concept of the hermeneutic circle to envision a whole in terms of a reality that was situated in the detailed experience of everyday existence by an individual (the parts). So understanding was developed on the basis of \\"fore-structures\\" of understanding, that allow external phenomena to be interpreted in a preliminary way. Another instance of Heidegger's use of the hermeneutic circle occurs in his examination of The Origin of the Work of Art (1935‚Äì1936). Here Heidegger argues that both artists and art works can only be understood with reference to each other, and that neither can be understood apart from 'art,' which, as well, cannot be understood apart from the former two. The 'origin' of the work of art is mysterious and elusive, seemingly defying logic: \\"thus we are compelled to follow the circle. This is neither a makeshift or a defect. To enter upon the path is the strength of thought, to continue on it is the feast of thought, assuming thinking is a craft. Not only is the main step from work to art a circle like the step from art to work, but every separate step that we attempt circles this circle. In order to discover the nature of the art that really prevails in the work, let us go to the actual work and ask the work what and how it is.\\" Heidegger continues, saying that a work of art is not a simple thing (as a doorknob or a shoe is, which do not normally involve aesthetic experience), but it cannot escape its \\"thingly character,\\" that is, being part of the larger order of things in the world, apart from all aesthetic experience. The synthesis of thingly and artistic is found in the work's allegorical and symbolic character, \\"but this one element in a work that manifests another, this one element that joins another, is the thingly feature in the art work\\". At this point, however, Heidegger raises the doubt of \\"whether the work is at bottom something else and not a thing at all.\\" Later he tries to break down the metaphysical opposition between form and matter, and the whole other set of dualisms which include: rational and irrational, logical and illogical/alogical, and subject and object. Neither of these concepts is independent of the other, yet neither can be reduced to the other: Heidegger suggests we have to look beyond both. Hans-Georg Gadamer (1975) further developed this concept, leading to what is recognized as a break with previous hermeneutic traditions. While Heidegger saw the hermeneutic process as cycles of self-reference that situated our understanding in a priori prejudices, Gadamer reconceptualized the hermeneutic circle as an iterative process through which a new understanding of a whole reality is developed by means of exploring the detail of existence. Gadamer viewed understanding as linguistically mediated, through conversations with others in which reality is explored and an agreement is reached that represents a new understanding.\\"Hans-Georg Gadamer\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2005. The centrality of conversation to the hermeneutic circle is developed by Donald Sch√∂n, who characterizes design as a hermeneutic circle that is developed by means of \\"a conversation with the situation.\\"Sch√∂n 1983: Paul de Man, in his essay \\"Form and Intent in the American New Criticism,\\" talks about the hermeneutic circle with reference to paradoxical ideas about \\"textual unity\\" espoused by and inherited from American criticism. De Man points out that the \\"textual unity\\" New Criticism locates in a given work has only a \\"semi-circularity\\" and that the hermeneutic circle is completed in \\"the act of interpreting the text.\\" Combining Gadamer and Heidegger into an epistemological critique of interpretation and reading, de Man argues that with New Criticism, American Criticism \\"pragmatically entered\\" the hermeneutic circle, \\"mistaking it for the organic circularity of natural processes.\\"de Man 1983: 29 For postmodernists, the hermeneutic circle is especially problematic. Not only do they believe one can only know the world through the words one uses to describe it, but also that \\"whenever people try to establish a certain reading of a text or expression, they allege other readings as the ground for their reading\\".Adler, E. 1997. \\"Seizing the Middle Ground: Constructivism in World Politics\\", European Journal of International Relations 3: 321‚Äì322 For postmodernists, in other words, \\"All meaning systems are open-ended systems of signs referring to signs referring to signs. No concept can therefore have an ultimate, unequivocal meaning\\".Waever 1996: 171 Critique Judith N. Shklar (1986) points out the ambiguity in the meaning and function of the \\"circle\\" as a metaphor for understanding. It is taken to refer to a geometric circle, rather than a circular process, it seems to imply a center, but it is unclear whether the interpreter him/herself stands there, or whether, on the contrary, some \\"organizing principle and illuminating principle apart from him [is] there waiting to be discovered.\\"Shklar, Judith N. \\"Squaring the Hermeneutic Circle.\\" Social Research. 71 (3), 2004, pg. 657‚Äì658 (Originally published Autumn 1986). Furthermore, and more problematic for Shklar, \\"the hermeneutic circle makes sense only if there is a known and closed whole, which can be understood in terms of its own parts and which has as its core God, who is its anchor and creator. Only the Bible really meets these conditions. It is the only possibly wholly self-sufficient text.\\" A further problem relates to the fact that Gadamer and others assume a fixed role for tradition (individual and disciplinary/academic) in the process of any hermeneutic understanding, while it is more accurate to say that interpreters have multiple and sometimes conflicting cultural attachments, yet this does not prevent intercultural and/or interdisciplinary dialogue. Finally, she warns that, at least in social science, interpretation is not a substitute for explanation. Heidegger (1935‚Äì1936) and Schockel (1998)Schokel, Luis Alonso and Jose Maria Bravo. A Manual of Hermeneutics (Biblical Seminar). Trans. Liliana M. Rosa. Brook W. R. Pearson (Ed.). Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998, pg. 74. respond to critics of this model of interpretation who allege it is a case of invalid reasoning by asserting that any form of reflection or interpretation must oscillate between particular and general, part and whole. It does not 'beg the question' because it is a different approach than formal logic. While it does imply presuppositions, it does not take any premise for granted. Schokel suggests a spiral as a better metaphor for interpretation, but admits that Schleiermacher's influence may have 'acclimatized' the term.

Club career Rossiter began his career at English Premier League side Sunderland, signing on as a professional at the Stadium of Light in the summer of 2002. On 6 November 2002, he made his senior debut in the League Cup third round, playing the whole 90 minutes as Sunderland beat Arsenal 3-2 at Highbury. He played in the League Cup fourth round against First Division side Sheffield United on 3 December, The Black Cats lost the game 2-0 at Bramall Lane. On 4 January 2003, Rossiter played in the 1-1 FA Cup third round draw at Bolton Wanderers. He came on for the injured Stephen Wright after 16 minutes, only to get injured himself and replaced by Joachim Bj√∂rklund just 11 minutes later. This turned out to be his last appearance for Sunderland. Whilst playing for the Republic of Ireland U21s on 1 April, he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in a 1-0 defeat against Albania, during the Under-21 European Championship qualifying. The injury required surgery and would keep Rossiter sidelined until at least Christmas. In May 2003, he was offered a new two-year contract at Sunderland by manager Mick McCarthy. He didn't feature during the 2003-04 season and was released from his contract in May 2004.

However brighter times were ahead as Mark collected his second League winners medal in a row in November as they won the title by 4 points from rivals Shamrock Rovers. The following year was not as successful as Mark struggled to keep a place in the starting XI for the Gypsies. Bohemians also had a disappointing 2010 season where the club lost their league title on goal difference and failed to make an impact in Europe where they made an embarrassing exit to Welsh side The New Saints. When his contract expired at the end of the season, he was released by Bohs. However, in February 2011, Pat Fenlon re-signed Mark just in time for the new season.Rossi returns to Bohs Rossiter signed for St.Patrick's Athletic for the 2012 seasonhttp://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/7231/player-influx-begins-in- inchicore/ and scored on his debut away to Glebe North in a friendly.

Senegalese laptots in Central Africa with French officer, 1890 History The term laptot probably derives from the word lappato bi in the Wolof language, referring to interpreters, intermediaries or brokers.James F. Searing. (1993) West African Slavery and Atlantic Commerce: The Senegal River Valley, 1700-1860 (New York: Cambridge University Press), p 77. Most laptots were recruited in Senegal, especially at French outposts in Saint- Louis and Dakar, during the late 18th and 19th centuries. Laptots were closely linked with the Tirailleurs s√©n√©galais, a military unit which enlisted soldiers from France's colonies in West Africa, founded in 1857. Unlike the tirailleurs, however, laptots served exclusively in Africa and Madagascar.Philip D. Curtin. (1975) Economic Change in Precolonial Africa: Senegambia in the Era of the Slave Trade. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. The French navy hired laptots on a temporary basis, using them to guard outposts, serve aboard French naval and commercial vessels, and perform various other tasks throughout French possessions in Africa. Laptots typically signed up for two-year contracts. They were often more reliable and effective than European personnel, who were too susceptible to endemic diseases such as malaria. Many laptots joined on a voluntary basis, although others were slaves in local communities who were forced to hand over half their wages to their owners. According to historian Francois Manchuelle, pay for some laptots‚Äîparticularly those who served aboard navy boats on the Senegal River‚Äîwas competitive with salaries for French sailors at the time. Manchuelle contends that men of the Soninke ethnic group were attracted to laptot service by the prospects of accumulating cash with which to compete for social status in their home communities.Fran√ßois Manchuelle. (1997) Willing Migrants: Soninke Labor Diasporas, 1848-1960. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press. Laptots were essential not only to French administration of its West African possessions, but also to subsequent French exploration and colonial penetration of Central Africa, parts of which became French Equatorial Africa after 1910. When the Franco-Italian explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza first ventured into the Equatorial African interior in 1876, he was accompanied by 13 laptots and four local interpreters as well as three other Frenchmen. Brazza's second expedition, in 1880, also relied heavily on laptots to carry loads, deliver messages, and provide protection against hostile populations. One laptot on this expedition was Malamine Camara, who achieved some renown for his exploits while serving under Brazza's command in Congo. Camara and two other laptots manned France's first outpost on the banks of the Congo River from October 1880 until May 1882, on the future site of Brazzaville, and may have prevented France's newly acquired territory there from being taken over by Belgium.Charles de Chavannes. (1935) Avec Brazza : Souvenirs de la Mission de l‚ÄôOuest Africaine (mars 1883 ‚Äì janvier 1886). Paris: Plon. Laptots provided the bulk of French manpower needs in its Equatorial African colonies until well into the 20th century, when more personnel began to be recruited locally.Cath√©rine Coquery-Vidrovitch.

He notably played as a professional for Grimsby Town where he started his career in 2002 going on to appear for The Mariners in the second, third and fourth tier of English football before his departure in 2005. He has also spent time playing in the League of Ireland Premier League for Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Dundalk. He has since made his trade in England's Non-League game for Halifax Town, York City, Tamworth, Worksop Town, Leigh Genesis, Retford United, Gainsborough Trinity, Droylsden, Brigg Town and Arnold Town. Career =Grimsby Town= Mansaram began his career at Grimsby Town progressing through the youth ranks before being promoted to the first team towards the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, whilst Town were competing in what is now the Football League Championship. He came into the squad with a good goal scoring record for both the reserve side and youth sides and it wasn't long before he made his break got his break within the first team. During the 2002‚Äì03 season, Town manager Paul Groves had been dealt several blows by the loss of loanee Steve Kabba as well as injuries to other forwards such as Michael Boulding while Phil Jevons was loaned out for financial reasons, this in turn saw Groves forced to select inexperienced youngsters such as Mansaram and David Soames. Despite impressing in the final half of the season, Mansaram was powerless in helping Grimsby avoid relegation from the First Division, however by the end of the season his performances had meant he was now considered as a first team regular. During the summer months he drew interest from Sheffield Wednesday but no concrete offer came in and the young striker nicknamed 'Flash' due to his lightning pace up front, stayed on at Blundell Park. Paul Groves eventually lost his job in February 2004 and was replaced by Nicky Law who in turn chopped and changed the Grimsby squad meaning signings such as Isaiah Rankin meant that Mansaram by the end of that season had found himself only playing a cameo role within the first team. Following a second successive relegation the Grimsby board installed another new manager in Russell Slade, and Mansaram now out of contract was kept on at the club during pre-season on a trial basis but despite being initially told he wasn't going to be offered a new deal he eventually signed on a 6-month deal. During the 2004‚Äì05 season, he was loaned out to Conference National side Halifax Town, and eventually moved to the club on a free transfer. =Halifax Town= Mansaram failed to make a break into the first team and found himself loaned out to Halifax Town before signing a permanent deal and joining fellow Mariner Greg Young at The Shay at the same time.Mansaram seals Halifax move Mansaram broke into the Town team but soon his performances became more rare and he was loaned out to, York City and later on TamworthMansaram nets Tamworth loan move before also making a brief spell with Worksop Town.Mansaram makes Worksop loan move =Sligo Rovers and Bohemians= Mansaram was then convinced by Sean Connor who brought him to Ireland where he signed for Sligo Rovers. He went on to be the club's top scorer in the 2006 campaign. When Connor moved to Bohemians, he made Mansaram one of his first signings. He scored his first goals for the club when scoring twice in the League Cup win over Bray Wanderers on 17 April 2007. Mansaram left Bohemians on 3 July 2008 having failed to play regular football in his second season at Bohs after the arrival of Jason Byrne and made a move back to England. =Leigh Genesis and Retford United= Darren's next port of call was to sign for non-league club Leigh Genesis, who had formed out of the old Conference club Leigh RMI. Mansaram was able to score three times for the club, before Leigh's wealthy benefactors pulled the plug in late 2009. Darren briefly played for Retford United F.C. before confirming a move back to Ireland. =Dundalk= In January 2009 Mansaram joined up with former manager Sean Connor at newly promoted Dundalk F.C.. He spent one season at Oriel Park but scored only five goals. His physical presence and ability to hold the ball quickly made him a fans favourite. Dundalk fans regularly sang his name to the tune Que Sera, Sera. However, when Connor left Dundalk, Mansaram was not offered a new deal. On 4 December 2009 he joined Gainsborough Trinity on trial.http://www.sportsecho.co.uk/news/Trinity-trial-Darren- Mansaram/article-1578046-detail/article.html =Return to Non-league= Mansaram completed his move to Trinity on 10 December 2009 on a non contract basis. After four games for The Blues, Mansaram was released on 12 February 2010. Mansaram Signed for fellow Conference North side Droylsden, on 26 February 2010, making only a single appearance for the club before being released. Mansaram signed for Armthorpe Welfare in the ninth tier of English football in the summer of 2010. Mansaram finished the 2010‚Äì11 season as the club's top scorer, and was the club's top scorer in the 2011‚Äì12 season until his departure. Mansaram joined Brigg Town in February 2012,http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Shaw-holds-nerve-ease-pressure- Wrens/story-15373931-detail/story.html but was released at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season.

In the first half of the 16th century, the region was devastated by attacking Turkish troops, and villages were depopulated. The Hungarian magnate Franz Batthy√°ny arranged for Schandorf and other villages to be repopulated by immigrants from Croatia, and for centuries, the village was an island of Croatian language and culture, surrounded by speakers of Hungarian and German. A dialect of Croatian unique to the village gradually evolved, rich in loanword vocabulary from Hungarian. With ever-increasing intermarriage, outmigration, and cosmopolitan influence of German, this dialect is today endangered. \\"Kroaten\\", Schandorf.at, 2010, web: SD-kr For centuries the village was part of Hungary. Following the First World War, with the breakup of the old Austrian Empire, the division of the land between the new nation states of Austria and Hungary was accompanied by turmoil; for details, see \\"Burgenland\\". The final establishment of the boundary in 1921 had the unfortunate effect of separating Schandorf from nearby Croatian-speaking communities, which remained part of Hungary. The separation became extreme after the Second World War, when the Iron Curtain descended blocking almost all passage across the border. This would have been a particularly salient fact of life for residents of Schandorf, whose outskirts lie only about from Hungarian territory.Source: Google maps Schandorf has not prospered in recent times; lack of economic opportunity has led to outmigration, particularly to the United States and Canada. \\"Urspruenge\\", Schandorf.at, 2010, web: SD-ur.

For examples theaters, museums, symphonies, jazz organizations, opera houses, ballet companies and many smaller professional and non-professional for-profit arts-related organizations (e.g. auction houses, art galleries, music companies, etc.).Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \\"Management and the Arts\\". Focal Press. p. 2. The duties of an arts administrator can include staff management, marketing, budget management, public relations, fundraising, program development evaluation, and board relations.  Duties and Roles of Arts Administrators  Art administrators (alternatively arts managers) work for arts and cultural organizations such as theatres, symphonies, art galleries, museums, arts festivals, arts centers, arts councils, regional arts boards, dance companies, community arts organizations, disability arts organizations, and heritage buildings.Arts administrator: Job description and activities Employers of arts administrators may be for-profit organizations, not-for- profit organizations or government agencies. Arts Administrators take on a variety of job duties which include developing budgets, planning events and performances, negotiating contracts and developing community interest in the arts organization. An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue. An arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for marketing events, event booking, and managing project budges. An arts administrator employed by a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), administrative staff, public relations, marketing, writing proposals and reports. A senior-level arts administrator may advise the board of directors or other senior managers on strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal public policy as it relates to human resources, health insurance, labor laws and volunteer risk management. Arts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators. Advocacy in Arts Administration Like any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \\"Management and the Arts\\". Focal Press. p. 84. External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological. Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization. Although a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \\"Management and the Arts\\". Focal Press. p. 87. Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \\"Management and the Arts\\". Focal Press. p. 93. Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE (Association of Arts Administration Educators) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality. The history of Advocacy for the arts in Canada is largely represented by the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des Artistes Canadiens (CARFAC). It is a non-profit corporation that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists. The organization's active involvement in advocacy, lobbying, research and public education on behalf of artists in Canada has defined CARFAC as an integral representative body for artists across Canada. In 1975 CARFAC was successful in lobbying for exhibition fees for artists. As a result the Canada Council made the payment of fees to living Canadian artists a requirement for eligibility for Program Assistance Grants to Public Art Galleries. CARFAC‚Äôs advocacy for artists resulted in the creation of the federal Copyright Act amendment in 1988. The Act recognizes artists as the primary producers of culture, and gives artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees. Arts Administrators throughout Canada actively refer to CARFAC's artist fee requirements when hiring professional artists.  Government Funding and Granting Bodies  Each country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. In Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts. These granting bodies are arms-length funding agencies, meaning they work separately from the government. Canada Council for the Arts, a federal granting body, was created in 1957 and it fulfilled the requirements of the Massey Commission. Canada Council for the Arts funds artists, collectives and arts organizations from all provinces and territories in Canada. CCA funds circus arts, dance, deaf and disability arts, digital arts, indigenous arts, inter-arts, literature, media arts, multidisciplinary activities, music and sound, theatre, visual arts and other discipline arts. In 2018-19, CCA granted $246.1M to the arts in Canada. In Ontario, the Ontario Arts Council provides grants to Ontario-based individual artists and arts professionals, ad hoc groups/collectives and organizations. The OAC provides two types of grants which are project grants (one-time grants for specific projects, available to individual artists, ad hoc groups/collectives and organizations) and operating grants (ongoing support for Ontario-based, not-for-profit arts organizations and for-profit book and magazine publishers). The United States arts system has a variety of government subsidies composing roughly 7 percent of the nation‚Äôs total investment in not-for-profit arts groups. The National Endowment for the Arts is an independent federal agency that was created in 1965 in the United States of America. The NEA‚Äôs role is to make sure all Americans have access to the arts no matter where they live. The NEA‚Äôs funding is project-based and goes to thousands of nonprofits each year, along with partnerships and special arts initiatives, research and other support that contribute to the vitality of neighborhoods, students and schools, workplace and culture. The United States also has State/Regional Arts Agencies. The State/Regional Arts Agencies are funded through the NEA since they are required to apportion funds to any state that has an art agency. Local Arts Agencies function as councils or commissions, or as city departments, and are funded by various sources: the NEA; state arts agencies, municipal budgets, and private donations. The arts in the United Kingdom is funded through the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport which is a department of the United Kingdom government. The DCMS is supported by 45 agencies and public bodies. In England, the Arts Council England is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. In the United Kingdom there is a charity called Art Fund. For over 110 years they have supported museums and galleries, and have helped them buy and display great works of art for everyone to enjoy. Art Fund has funding for acquisitions, training and development, and tours and exhibitions. Art Fund also advocates and campaigns for important causes like the free entry to national museums in the UK, and more recently for tax incentives to encourage philanthropy.  Planned Giving  Planned giving also known as legacy giving is a form of philanthropy that is a common practice in the arts sector. Planned giving is when a donor leaves an endowment, assets or a portion of their last will and testament to an organization at the end of their lifetime. Strategic charitable gift planning is a donor-centred process of planning current and future charitable gifts in a way that meets the donor‚Äôs philanthropic goals and balances personal, family and tax considerations. Legacy giving is considered the highest charitable gift an organization can receive and often takes many years to establish this kind of relationship with a donor. Academic programs Arts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia. In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated. Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as business administration, they also include specialized courses on administering non-profit arts and cultural organizations. Arts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as public administration, business administration, arts law, and management. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's Master of Business Administration (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at Columbia University is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an Ivy league university. Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience. At some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University), performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program), or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, University of Southern California's Master of Science in Arts Leadership program). Universities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented). The master's degree at some schools is an MBA, while other universities offer MFA, MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed. For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor. Though curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ. Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum. Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy. Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \\"in the field,\\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences. Seattle University's MFA in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum. They believe this emphasis on real- world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) , one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual & performing arts centers. Most programs require two years in residence, though Drexel University, University of Denver, and Goucher College offer online options with limited residency. The University of Kentucky, and Kutztown University of Pennsylvania offer fully online degrees in arts administration. In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as Seattle University have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends. Some programs offer dual degrees. For example, the University of Cincinnati offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful CEOs and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.www.ArtsAdminMBA.com In Italy, the Istituto Europeo di Design, in Venice, offers a Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in Bologna, at the University of Bologna, called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts , offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the St. John International University offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl. Other programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the College of Fine Arts to Heinz College's School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions. Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at Southern Methodist University, offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business. Some programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's Master of Science in Arts Leadership which is housed within the USC Thornton School of Music, and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art. Several universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples. Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.

It was first discovered in the early 1960s in Canada, and was isolated in 1972. The toxin is produced by at least eight different genera of cyanobacteria and has been reported in North America, South America, Central America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Symptoms of anatoxin exposure include loss of coordination, muscular fasciculations, convulsions and death by respiratory paralysis. Its mode of action is through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) where it mimics the binding of the receptor's natural ligand, acetylcholine. As such, anatoxin-a has been used for medicinal purposes to investigate diseases characterized by low acetylcholine levels. Due to its high toxicity and potential presence in drinking water, anatoxin-a poses a threat to animals, including humans. While methods for detection and water treatment exist, scientists have called for more research to improve reliability and efficacy. Anatoxin-a is not to be confused with guanitoxin (formerly anatoxin-a(S)), another potent cyanotoxin that has a similar mechanism of action to that of anatoxin-a and is produced by many of the same cyanobacteria genera, but is structurally unrelated. History Anatoxin-a was first discovered by P.R. Gorham in the early 1960s, after several herds of cattle died as a result of drinking water from Saskatchewan Lake in Ontario, Canada, which contained toxic algal blooms. It was isolated in 1972 by J.P. Devlin from the cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae.Botana L.M, James K, Crowley J, Duphard J, Lehane M, Furey A. Phycotoxins: Chemistry and Biochemistry. Blackwell Publishing; 2007. In 1977, Carmichael, Gorham, and Biggs experimented with anatoxin-a. They introduced toxic cultures of A. flos-aquae into the stomachs of two young male calves, and observed that muscular fasciculations and loss of coordination occurred in a matter of minutes, while death due to respiratory failure occurred anywhere between several minutes and a few hours. They also established that extensive periods of artificial respiration did not allow for detoxification to occur and natural neuromuscular functioning to resume. From these experiments, they calculated that the oral minimum lethal dose (MLD) (of the algae, not the anatoxin molecule), for calves is roughly 420 mg/kg body weight. In the same year, Devlin and colleagues discovered the bicyclic secondary amine structure of anatoxin-a. They also performed experiments similar to those of Carmichael et al. on mice. They found that anatoxin-a kills mice 2‚Äì5 minutes after intraperitoneal injection preceded by twitching, muscle spasms, paralysis and respiratory arrest. They determined the LD50 for mice to be 250 ¬µg/kg body weight. Electrophysiological experiments done by Spivak et al. (1980) on frogs showed that anatoxin-a is a potent agonist of the muscle-type Œ±12Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ nAChR. Anatoxin-a induced depolarizing neuromuscular blockade, contracture of the frog's rectus abdominis muscle, depolarization of the frog sartorius muscle, desensitization, and alteration of the action potential. Later, Thomas et al., (1993) through his work with chicken Œ±4Œ≤2 nAChR subunits expressed on mouse M 10 cells and chicken Œ±7 nAChR expressed in oocytes from Xenopus laevis, showed that anatoxin-a is also a potent agonist of neuronal nAChR.  Cases of toxicity  Many cases of wildlife and livestock deaths due to anatoxin-a have been reported since its discovery. Domestic dog deaths due to the cyanotoxin, as determined by analysis of stomach contents, have been observed at the lower North Island in New Zealand in 2005, in eastern France in 2003, in California of the United States in 2002 and 2006, in Scotland in 1992, and in Ireland in 1997 and 2005. In each case the dogs began showing muscle convulsions within minutes, and were dead within a matter of hours. Numerous cattle fatalities arising from the consumption of water contaminated with cyanobacteria that produce anatoxin-a have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Finland between 1980 and the present. Flamingos at Lake Bogoria A particularly interesting case of anatoxin-a poisoning is that of lesser flamingos at Lake Bogoria in Kenya. The cyanotoxin, which was identified in the stomachs and fecal pellets of the birds, killed roughly 30,000 flamingos in the second half of 1999, and continues to cause mass fatalities annually, devastating the flamingo population. The toxin is introduced into the birds via water contaminated with cyanobacterial mat communities that arise from the hot springs in the lake bed. Mechanism of toxicity Anatoxin-a is an agonist of both neuronal Œ±4Œ≤2 and Œ±4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors present in the CNS as well as the Œ±12Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ muscle-type nAchRs that are present at the neuromuscular junction. Anatoxin-a has an affinity for these receptors that is about 20 times greater than that of acetylcholine. However, the cyanotoxin has little effect on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; it has a 100 fold lesser selectivity for these types of receptors than it has for nAchRs. Anatoxin-a also shows much less potency in the CNS than in neuromuscular junctions. In hippocampal and brain stem neurons, a 5 to 10 times greater concentration of anatoxin-a was necessary to activate nAchRs than what was required in the PNS. In normal circumstances, acetylcholine binds to nAchRs in the post-synaptic neuronal membrane, causing a conformational change in the extracellular domain of the receptor which in turn opens the channel pore. This allows Na+ and Ca2+ ions to move into the neuron, causing cell depolarization and inducing the generation of action potentials, which allows for muscle contraction. The acetylcholine neurotransmitter then dissociates from the nAchR, where it is rapidly cleaved into acetate and choline by acetylcholinesterase.Purves, Dale, George Augustine, David Fitzpatrick, William Hall, Anthony-Samuel Lamantia, and Leonard White. Neuroscience. 5. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2012. The effects of anatoxin-a on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction Anatoxin-a binding to these nAchRs cause the same effects in neurons. However, anatoxin-a binding is irreversible, and the anatoxin-a nAchR complex cannot be broken down by acetylcholinesterase. Thus, the nAchR is temporarily locked open and after a period of time becomes desensitized. In this desensitized state the nAchRs no longer let cations pass through, which ultimately leads to a blockage of neuromuscular transmission. Two enantiomers of anatoxin-a, the positive enantiomer, (+)anatoxin-a, is 150 fold more potent than the synthetic negative enantiomer, (‚àí)anatoxin-a. This is because (+)anatoxin-a, the s-cis enone conformation, has a distance a 6.0 √Ö between its nitrogen and carbonyl group, which corresponds well to the 5.9 √Ö distance that separate the nitrogen and oxygen in acetylcholine. Respiratory arrest, which results in a lack of an oxygen supply to the brain, is the most evident and lethal effect of anatoxin-a. Injections of mice, rats, birds, dogs, and calves with lethal doses of anatoxin-a have demonstrated that death is preceded by a sequence of muscle fasciculations, decreased movement, collapse, exaggerated abdominal breathing, cyanosis and convulsions. In mice, anatoxin-a also seriously impacted blood pressure and heart rate, and caused severe acidosis. Stability and degradation Anatoxin-a is unstable in water and other natural conditions, and in the presence of UV light undergoes photodegradation, being converted to the non-toxic products dihydroanatoxin-a and epoxyanatoxin-a. The photodegradation of anatoxin-a is dependent on pH and sunlight intensity but independent of oxygen, indicating that the degradation by light is not achieved through the process of photo-oxidation. Studies have shown that some microorganisms are capable of degrading anatoxin-a. A study done by Kiviranta and colleagues in 1991 showed that the bacterial genus Pseudomonas was capable of degrading anatoxin-a at a rate of 2‚Äì10 Œºg/ml per day. Later experiments done by Rapala and colleagues (1994) supported these results. They compared the effects of sterilized and non-sterilized sediments on anatoxin-a degradation over the course of 22 days, and found that after that time vials with the sterilized sediments showed similar levels of anatoxin-a as at the commencement of the experiment, while vials with non- sterilized sediment showed a 25-48% decrease. Public health Despite the relatively low frequency of anatoxin-a relative to other cyanotoxins, its high toxicity (the lethal dose is not known for humans, but is estimated to be less than 5 mg for an adult male) means that it is still considered a serious threat to terrestrial and aquatic organisms, most significantly to livestock and to humans. Anatoxin-a is suspected to have been involved in the death of at least one person. The threat posed by anatoxin-a and other cyanotoxins is increasing as both fertilizer runoff, leading to eutrophication in lakes and rivers, and higher global temperatures contribute to a greater frequency and prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms. =Detection= There are two categories of anatoxin-a detection methods. Biological methods have involved administration of samples to mice and other organisms more commonly used in ecotoxicological testing, such as brine shrimp (Artemia salina), larvae of the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, and various insect larvae. Problems with this methodology include an inability to determine whether it is anatoxin-a or another neurotoxin that causes the resulting deaths. Large amounts of sample material are also needed for such testing. In addition to the biological methods, scientists have used chromatography to detect anatoxin-a. This is complicated by the rapid degradation of the toxin and the lack of commercially available standards for anatoxin-a. =Water treatment= As of now, there is no official guideline level for anatoxin-a,Ho L, Sawade E, & Newcombe G. Biological treatment option for cyanobacteria metabolite removal - A review. Water Research. 2012; 46(5): 1536-1548. although scientists estimate that a level of 1 Œºg l‚àí1 would be sufficiently low.Fawell J.K, Mitchell R.E, Hill R.E, Everett D.J. \\"The toxicity of cyanobacterial toxins in the mouse: II anatoxin-a. Human and Experimental Toxicology 1999; 18, pp. 168‚Äì173 Likewise, there are no official guidelines regarding testing for anatoxin-a. Among methods of reducing the risk for cyanotoxins, including anatoxin-a, scientists look favorably on biological treatment methods because they do not require complicated technology, are low maintenance, and have low running costs. Few biological treatment options have been tested for anatoxin-a specifically, although a species of Pseudomonas, capable of biodegrading anatoxin-a at a rate of 2‚Äì10 Œºg ml‚àí1 d‚àí1, has been identified. Biological (granular) activated carbon (BAC) has also been tested as a method of biodegradation, but it is inconclusive whether biodegradation occurred or if anatoxin-a was simply adsorbing the activated carbon. Others have called for additional studies to determine more about how to use activated carbon effectively. Chemical treatment methods are more common in drinking water treatment compared to biological treatment, and numerous processes have been suggested for anatoxin-a. Oxidants such as potassium permanganate, ozone, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have worked in lowering levels of anatoxin-a, but others, including photocatalysis, UV photolysis, and chlorination, have not shown great efficacy. Directly removing the cyanobacteria in the water treatment process through physical treatment (e.g., membrane filtration) is another option because most of the anatoxin-a is found within the cells when the bloom is growing.[citation needed] Additional research needs to be done to find more reliable and efficient methods of both detection and treatment. Biosynthesis Anatoxin-a is synthesized in vivo in the species Anabaena flos aquae, as well as several other genera of cyanobacteria. Anatoxin-a and related chemical structures are produced using acetate and glutamate. Further enzymatic reduction of these precursors results in the formation of anatoxin-a. Homoanatoxin, a similar chemical, is produced by Oscillatoria formosa and utilizes the same precursor. However, homoanatoxin undergoes a methyl addition by S-adenosyl-L_methionine instead of an addition of electrons, resulting in a similar analogue. Laboratory uses Anatoxin-a is a very powerful nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist and as such has been extensively studied for medicinal purposes. It is mainly used as a pharmacological probe in order to investigate diseases characterized by low acetylcholine levels, such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Further research on anatoxin-a and other less potent analogues are being tested as possible replacements for acetylcholine. Laboratory synthesis =Cyclic expansion of tropanes= The first biologically occurring initial substance for tropane expansion into anatoxin-a was cocaine, which has similar stereochemistry to anatoxin-a. Cocaine is first converted into the endo isomer of cyclopropane, which is then photolytically cleaved to obtain an alpha, beta unsaturated ketone. Through the use of diethyl azodicarboxylate, the ketone is demethylated and anatoxin-a is formed. A similar, more recent synthesis pathway involves producing 2-tropinone from cocaine and treating the product with ethyl chloroformate producing a bicyclic ketone. This product is combined with trimethylsilyldiazylmethane, an organoaluminum Lewis acid and trimethylsinyl enol ether to produce tropinone. This method undergoes several more steps, producing useful intermediates as well as anatoxin-a as a final product. Cocaine, a precursor for anatoxin-a synthesis =Cyclization of cyclooctenes= The first and most extensively explored approach used to synthesize anatoxin-a in vitro, cyclooctene cyclization involves 1,5-cycloocadiene as its initial source. This starting substance is reacted to form methyl amine and combined with hypobromous acid to form anatoxin-a. Another method developed in the same laboratory uses aminoalcohol in conjunction with mercuric (II) acetate and sodium borohydride. The product of this reaction was transformed into an alpha, beta ketone and oxidized by ethyl azodicarboxylate to form anatoxin-a. =Enantioselective enolization strategy= This method for anatoxin-a production was one of the first used that does not utilize a chimerically analogous starting substance for anatoxin formation. Instead, a racemic mixture of 3-tropinone is used with a chiral lithium amide base and additional ring expansion reactions in order to produce a ketone intermediate. Addition of an organocuprate to the ketone produces an enol triflate derivative, which is then lysed hydrogenously and treated with a deprotecting agent in order to produce anatoxin-a. Similar strategies have also been developed and utilized by other laboratories. =Intramolecular cyclization of iminium ions= Iminium ion cyclization utilizes several different pathways to create anatoxin-a, but each of these produces and progresses with a pyrrolidine iminium ion. The major differences in each pathway relate to the precursors used to produce the imium ion and the total yield of anatoxin-a at the end of the process. These separate pathways include production of alkyl iminium salts, acyl iminium salts and tosyl iminium salts. =Enyne metathesis= Enyne metathesis of anatoxin-a involves the use of a ring closing mechanism and is one of the more recent advances in anatoxin-a synthesis. In all methods involving this pathway, pyroglutamic acid is used as a starting material in conjunction with a Grubb's catalyst. Similar to iminium cyclization, the first attempted synthesis of anatoxin-a using this pathway used a 2,5-cis-pyrrolidine as an intermediate.

When \\"Age of Reason\\" reached the top of the charts in July 1988, Pigott became the first Australian woman to have written a No. 1 hit. It was co-written with Todd Hunter. Scripts by Pigott for TV include Sweet and Sour (created with Tim Gooding), Heartbreak High (also co-wrote theme with Hunter and other songs) and Mortified (created by Angela Webber). Films include: Broken English (co-written with Gregor Nicholas and James Salter) and Alex (original music with Hunter, and lead vocals on soundtrack). Early life Pigott was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney in Croydon together with schoolmate Angela Webber. Following matriculation from high school in the 1970s, Pigott studied Architecture at the University of Sydney. Bands =XL Capris= XL Capris was an indie-punk band formed in 1978 by Johanna Pigott (bass guitar, vocal, keyboard, guitar)Johanna Pigott and related entries at Australian Rock Database: *Johanna Pigott: *XL Capris (1978‚Äì82): *Sardine v (1982): *Scribble (1983‚Äì87): aka 'Alligator Bagg', Tim Gooding (guitar, vocal) aka 'Errol Cruz', Julie Anderson (drums) aka 'Nancy Serapax' and Kimble Rendall (guitar, vocal) aka 'Dag Rattler'. Early practice sessions were in the front room of a Birchgrove house where Gooding (and later Rendall) lived. Their first single was a punk version of Tommy Leonetti's \\"My City of Sydney\\" (1979), which had a promo video showing the four in bed together. Pigott was lead vocalist and bass guitarist in the video. The single received some radio airplay but was not a commercial success. Second 1979 single \\"Skylab (Son of Telstar)\\" was written by Rendall but had even less success. Their next single, \\"World War Three\\" (October 1980), produced by Todd Hunter and was written by Pigott and Hunter. Note: Requires user to input song title, e.g. WORLD WAR THREE Rendall left to form Le Hoodoo Gurus, became a music video director and then a second unit director for the latter two Matrix series movies. He was replaced by Hunter (guitar), Michael Churnside (bass) joined, Anderson left to be replaced by Barry Blackler (drum), Michael Farmer (drum) also joined. First album was Where's Hank? (March 1981, produced by Hunter). Gooding wrote ten songs including two with Pigott: \\"Red Bikini Runaway\\" (single, April 1981) and \\"Hi Rise Heart\\". Pigott also wrote \\"Evelyn\\". 'Hank' was a German shepherd owned by Rendall: \\"Hank went to live on a farm at Nambucca Heads\\". Based on Rendall's and Pigott's recollections, the album title Where's Hank? is a pun on a 1980s TV ad for a chocolate bar: 'Where's George?' The response is ... 'gone for a Tosca!' For the second album Weeds (October 1981, produced by Hunter) Pigott and Hunter wrote six songs including the single \\"Igloos\\", Pigott wrote \\"Please Excuse Me\\" and Gooding also wrote six songs. Hunter returned to Dragon late in 1981 and XL Capris dissolved in 1982.

They dissolved in less than one year. Premature Ejaculation was reformed in 1986 by Williams and all new members. The group disbanded completely after Rozz Williams' death in 1998.  History  = Formation = Premature Ejaculation was one of Rozz Williams' many musical projects. Unlike his deathrock band Christian Death, Premature Ejaculation did not use standard \\"rock band\\" instruments. Instead, their sound was created using various objects, instruments and lo-fi devices. Early Premature Ejaculation recordings are rare. Much of their original work was only shared among friends. Premature Ejaculation played few live performances, mostly because clubs refused to book them due to their controversial stage theatrics. One of their older acts included Athey eating a dead cat (the animal was roadkill), documented in the book Hardcore California. = Rebirth = When the band reformed in 1986, Williams was joined by Chuck Collison, and temporarily Lee Wildes and Kris Fuller (both deceased). Gene Evans and Steve Messer began producing their live performances. The group's theme remained avant-garde throughout and focused on the bizarre and taboo. They used sound clips such as crying babies and chainsaws, and other unexpected sounds and noises to create intense soundscapes. Their refined and overwhelmingly dark use of multimedia often left their fans astonished, and sometimes sickened. Chuck Collison played a major role in the reformed group, especially with regard to their higher quality sound. Collison started his own label 'The Happiest Place on Earth' to release Premature Ejaculation's recordings. The name was soon changed to 'The Happiest Tapes on Earth' in order to avoid potential legal problems with Disney. The first two full-length recordings were released via Chuck Collison's label. Releases were only available in the cassette format until later releases on vinyl and compact disc. Death Cultures was the first to be released followed by Blood Told in Spine and Assertive Discipline. The reformed group released multiple recordings on other labels, with Anesthesia on Dark Vinyl Records from Germany being among their most popular. The group also released recordings on Cleopatra Records, Triple XXX, and numerous other labels. Premature Ejaculation was not Rozz Williams' most well-known project. Christian Death remains his most famous group (also see Shadow Project with Eva O). Although not his most famous work, Williams often cited Premature Ejaculation as his favorite musical venture. The group left behind a prolific back catalog including Wound of Exit, released posthumously.

It is located northeast of Vill√©, on the left bank of the river Giessen close to the valley of Erlenbach, from which it derives its name. To the North and West it is bounded by mountains leading to the communes of Hohwald and Breitenbach. To the East is the peak of Ungersberg. Numerous streams flow from this mounting and the buttresses of the Champ du Feu to the north, which merge to form the brook of the Erlenberg. This river formerly flowed down the main street of the village, but has now been covered. The village is at approximately altitude. Until 1867 the village was known by its German name Erlenbach (in a number of variations) (In romance languages Erlen shortens to 'Al' and bach becomes ba and thence b√©). The name Alb√© was formally adopted in 1919. Under Louis XIV it was awarded a coat of arms emblazoned \\"Azure, three chevrons Argent\\". The Azure perhaps suggests the river and the three chevrons a narrow boxed valley. History The village is first mentioned in 1303 as a possession of the Habsburg Empire. A growth in the population, as a result of an expansion in farming, viticulture and forestry led to the demands by the abbot of Honcourt for the construction of a church which was begun by 1342. From the 13th to the 15th century, the area was repeatedly occupied by various armies loyal to the German Emperor or the Pope; the villages suffered greatly, especially during the winter of 1444‚Äì1445. The nearby camp of Armagnacs, stationed in Ch√¢tenois, may have plundered Alb√© and other villages in the region; however the relative inaccessibility of the area, and the passage of Burgundian troops saved the town from destruction. During the Easter of 1525, the peasantry of Alb√© took part in a revolt and the Abbeys of Honcourt and Baumgarten were destroyed. The revolt was crushed by troops from Lorraine on 20 May 1525, and Alb√© was named by the Lord of Ensisheim as among those responsible for the sacking of the abbeys, and liable for reprisal. Fire spread through the village in 1575 resulting in the destruction of 42 houses and the church. The town suffered again during the Thirty Years War. After attempting to resist Swedish troops, the town was looted and laid waste. After the war, the town grew again and there was an influx of people from many different backgrounds, who brought with them their architectural traditions. A century of peace brought prosperity based again on viticulture, and during the 18th century many grand lintel frame houses were built. The French revolution brought a mixture of fear and hope, and the town preserves a tree of freedom, a lime planted in 1795 in the village square. The church had been enlarged in 1752, and by 1802 the village had a full-time vicar and obtained the status of parish. At the end of the 19th century the farmland was becoming exhausted and the spread of phylloxera gravely affected the town and the population shrank. Coal mines are operating in the village. Population Economy The town is principally known for its wine, it is the only town in the valley to produce its own vin d'Alsace. The vineyards are on sunny slopes. The vineyards now cover about , and this area is expected to increase as hillsides are improved for the purpose. Most of the grapes are processed locally. The forest surrounding the town () is largely held in common, though some is privately managed for chestnuts and fuel. There is little industry in Alb√©, and even cottage industries such as weaving are not significant. However the production of brandy has taken place on a commercial scale. Culture The Maison du Val de Vill√© is a local museum, housed in the former mairie.

He was a halfback for the Australian national team. He played in eight Tests between 1948 and 1949 as captain on two occasions. Playing career Known as Keith, he was born in Armidale but grew up in Newcastle, New South Wales and played his junior football with Wests Newcastle. He was a talented soccer player as a youngster and also played first grade and district representative cricket in Newcastle. He had first represented in rugby league for New South Wales in 1941. During WWII he was required to continue working as a boilermaker, it being an essential service. He joined the AIF in 1944 and served with the 2/43 Australian Infantry Battalion. He was stationed at Goulburn and though restricted in availability signed to play with Sydney's Newtown club in 1943 and played two first grade games that year. He served overseas from 1944-45. He returned to Newtown after the war and played all of his first grade football with the club from 1946-50 scoring 288 points as a goalkicking half- back in 72 first grade games. After the war he made State appearances regularly against Queensland from 1946 to 1948 and against a touring New Zealand side in 1948. He made his Australian Test debut in 1948 in the domestic series against New Zealand and played in both Tests kicking five goals in all. He was selected on the 1948-49 Kangaroo Tour of England and appeared in four Tests and 12 minor tour matches. He was the tour's leading goalkicker finishing with 39 goals (and 3 tries) in his 16 appearances ahead of John Graves's 35 goals. In 1949 he was named by a local newspaper.Sun Herald (Sydney) as New South Wales' Player of Year after captaining NSW to a 4-0 whitewash against Queensland in the interstate series. At the end of the 1949 season he was selected to lead an Australian side on a ten match tour of New Zealand. He captained Australia in both Tests of the series to a loss and a win and played in three additional tour matches scoring 2 tries and 11 goals in all. Post playing At the tail end of his playing career Froome coached a country side in Gunnedah. Keith and his family settled in Bellingen NSW. He had a career in the club industry and as a liquor sales representative. Keith succumbed to cancer aged 57 on 28 January 1978. In 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia, Froome was named in the Newtown Jets 18-man team of the century.

This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with lectin chaperones calreticulin and calnexin (CNX) to modulate folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. It is thought that complexes of lectins and this protein mediate protein folding by promoting formation of disulfide bonds in their glycoprotein substrates.  Structure  The PDIA3 protein consists of four thioredoxin-like domains: a, b, b‚Ä≤, and a‚Ä≤. The a and a‚Ä≤ domains have Cys-Gly-His-Cys active site motifs (C57-G58-H59-C60 and C406-G407-H408-C409) and are catalytically active. The bb‚Ä≤ domains contain a CNX binding site, which is composed of positively charged, highly conserved residues (K214, K274, and R282) that interact with the negatively charged residues of the CNX P domain. The b‚Ä≤ domain comprises the majority of the binding site, but the Œ≤4-Œ≤5 loop of the b domain provides additional contact (K214) to strengthen the interaction. A transient disulfide bond forms between the N-terminal cysteine in the catalytic motif and a substrate, but in a step called \\"escape pathway\\", the bond is disrupted as the C-terminal cysteine attacks the N-terminal cysteine to release the substrate.  Function  The PDIA3 protein is a thiol oxidoreductase that has protein disulfide isomerase activity. PDIA3 is also part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide loading complex, which is essential for formation of the final antigen conformation and export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. This protein of the endoplasmic reticulum interacts with lectin chaperones such as calreticulin and CNX in order to modulate the folding of proteins that are newly synthesized. It is believed that PDIA3 plays a role in protein folding by promoting the formation of disulfide bonds, and that CNX facilitates the positioning substrates next to the catalytic cysteines. This function allows it to serve as a redox sensor by activating mTORC1, which then mediates mTOR complex assembly to adapt cells to oxidative damage. Thus, PDIA3 regulates cell growth and death according to oxygen concentrations, such as in the hypoxic microenvironment of bones. Additionally, PDIA3 activates cell anchorage in bones by associating with cell division and cytoskeleton proteins, such as beta-actin and vimentin, to form a complex which controls TUBB3 folding and proper attachment of the microtubules to the kinetochore. PDIA3 also plays a role in cytokine-dependent signal transduction, including STAT3 signaling.  Clinical significance  It has been demonstrated that the downregulation of ERp57 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in early-stage cervical cancer. It has also been demonstrated that ERp57/PDIA3 binds specific DNA fragments in a melanoma cell line. PDIA3 is also involved in bone metastasis, which is the most common source of distant relapse in breast cancer. In addition to cancer, overexpression of PDIA3 is linked to renal fibrosis, which is characterized by excess synthesis and secretion of ECM leading to ER stress.  Interactions  It has been demonstrated that PDIA3 interacts with: *BACE1, *ERp27, *tapasin, *CRT, and *CNX.

The brick building sits at the corner of Tillman Street and Butternut Street in the residential section adjacent to the 3000 block of Michigan Avenue. The building is an imposing presence in the neighborhood of small, late 19th-century houses and cottages, measuring seventy feet on Tillman and one hundred feet on Butternut. Bohemian period (1914-1962) According to the building permit issued March 20, 1914, the Bohemian National Home (Cesky Norodni Dum, as written in stone on the front of the building) was built by a group called the Bohemian Society.Detroit Department of Buildings and Safety, Building Permit No.842, March 20, 1914, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. The building's original floor plan included a full ballroom with a stage and balcony; a \\"green room\\" with an access stairwell directly to the stage; a small gymnasium with brass tie downs for gymnastic equipment; a full shower and bathroom; a full service barroom with ladies‚Äô and men‚Äôs bathrooms; a full commercial kitchen; two multipurpose rooms; and a caretaker's apartment. Arts and Crafts references appear, most notably, in the three-panel oak doors throughout the interior of the building. The original Bohemian immigrants came to Detroit to escape Prussian oppression and economic hardship in their homeland. A dozen recent arrivals formed the first Detroit lodge, in 1874, under the auspices of the Bohemian Society of America. This national organization first organized in 1854 in St. Louis, Missouri. The original Detroit lodge bore the name of Karel Havilicek Barovsky, a Czech hero of the 1848 revolution against the Habsburg dynasty. In 1890, the Detroit Bohemian Turners Society built Detroit's first Bohemian hall at the corner of Erskine and St. Antoine, on the near east side. A flag-bearing procession of the various Bohemian organizations who would use the facility commemorated the opening. By 1910, however, the east side hall had become too small to accommodate the growing community. The original plans for a new west side hall, and the announcement of a fund-raising drive to finance the project, appeared in the Detroit Times on August 19, 1910. The existing building at Butternut and Tillman is a scaled-down version of the $30,000, three-story building originally planned, but it proved sufficiently large to house the Bohemian community until the post World War II era.James K. Anderson, \\"Brotherhood Movement Vital to City's Nationality Groups,\\" The Detroit News, November 28, 1954, sec.

In 1962, a newly formed organization called the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association purchased the building.J. Dvorak to Detroit Lithuanian Home Association, L, January 25, 1971, Papers of Detroit Lithuanian Home Association, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Lithuanian period (1962-1996) The period from 1920 to 1950 saw very little increase in the population of Lithuanians in Detroit. In 1951, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Wayne State University conducted research in preparation for two international festivals at Belle Isle. The study of ethnic groups in Detroit found that the Lithuanian community still numbered about 10,000, as it had in the 1920s. The Lithuanians were still in their original three settlements, but had lost two of their original churches as they continued to move to other parts of the city. Saint Anthony on the west side was the only original church still operating in 1951, although two new churches had been built in new communities to replace the two that were lost. The American Lithuanian Choir was one of the best known choirs in the city and two radio stations continued broadcasts in Lithuanian.Wayne State University Department of Sociology and Anthropology, \\"Ethnic Groups in Detroit: 1951\\", TD, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. In sum, the Detroit Lithuanian community had survived the period of nativism and low immigration with its unique culture intact. Detroit, provided, therefore, a natural choice as a location to resettle Lithuanian immigrants displaced by World War II and the Soviet occupation of their homeland. In early November 1953, four Lithuanian men met at the Alytaus Bar at 3415 Michigan Avenue. One of the men was the owner of the bar, Peter Podolski, who lived with his wife Rose in the apartment located above the bar. The other men were Viktoras Perminas, Joseph Kowalski and Alex Conrad, an attorney. Throughout the month, the men met regularly as they developed plans for a private Lithuanian club. The Alytaus Bar was already used as an informal Lithuanian center, helping newly arrived Lithuanians secure employment at the Star Tool and Die Company located directly behind the bar. The building adjacent to the bar was known as a \\"camp\\", providing temporary food and lodging to the displaced Lithuanians.\\"Darius and Gireno Club Constitution\\", TD, 27 November 1953, Papers of Darius and Gireno Club, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library; Mr. Leroy Estrada, interview by author, Tape Recording, Detroit, Michigan, 14 July 1995. So a more formal organization to help these immigrants adjust to American life and simultaneously, take advantage of the new energy in preserving Lithuanian culture, was a natural development in the Michigan Avenue neighborhood. The club was dedicated to the memory of Steponas Dariaus and Stasys Gireno, two Lithuanian-American pilots who attempted a heroic flight in 1933. After successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean from New York, the two pilots attained martyr status when they were shot down by the Germans before reaching Lithuania.Kudirka, \\"The Lithuanians\\", 7. On November 27, 1953, an assumed name was filed for the Dariaus and Gireno Club, or the D and G Klubas, as it was commonly known to its members. The clubs initial registered office was listed as 3417 Michigan Avenue; the apartment of the Podolskis. The constitution of the club set forth its purpose as: *The perpetuation of Lithuanian history and language; *The study and perpetuation of Lithuanian culture and literature; *To engage in athletics and sports; *To get together at intervals in diverse past times such as dancing, concerts and like and; *To assist and give aid to Lithuanians who recently came to the USA so that they may become acquainted with the customs, habits and language of America and so that they may understand and respect the United States Government and its Constitution.\\"D & G Constitution\\", Burton Historical Collection. The founders of the club seemed especially concerned with the fifth purpose of the constitution and required each new member to sign a pledge form which stated that the individual did: solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I do not advocate the overthrow of the government by force or violence; that I am not a member of any political party or organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence; that I am not directly or indirectly affiliated with and or associated in any manner whatsoever as a member of any subversive organization as prepared and released by the Committee on Un-American Activities, US. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. dated May 14, 1951.\\"Dariaus and Gireno Anketa\\", TD, The Darius and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. These two documents make it clear that this new wave of Lithuanian immigrants was decidedly anti- Communist. Although the influence of McCarthyism was prolific in America at the time, the displaced Lithuanian immigrants had personal experience with the Soviet Communists and seemed to embrace the principles of the Committee on Un- American Activities naturally, without any urging. There in no record of a permanent location for the Dariaus and Gireno Club, other than Michigan Avenue address, until a new organization is formed in 1962 called the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association. The new group was actually formed, according to a 1966 Annual Report, for the expressed purpose of buying a building to provide \\"a central home for all member organizations.\\" The only business reported for that year, and previous years of reports, was the purchase in 1962, of the Bohemian National Hall.Jonas Gaizutis, \\"Annual Reports\\", TD, 1965‚Äì66, The Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Although the annual reports submitted to the government present a simplistic version of the purpose of the new organization, the Constitution and Bylaws of the group reveal more specifics. Article I of the document states: We Lithuanians, representing numerous clubs, organizations, associations and groups desiring to promote, foster and facilitate the propagation, retention and understanding of Lithuanian culture, language and tradition for the purpose of enriching and contributing to American and Lithuanian ideals, do hereby establish the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association as a non-profit and self-supporting corporation. The association shall acquire and operate a building which shall be available to all Lithuanians and organizations loyal to the United States and the concept of a free and independent Lithuania and on such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the association. The association shall have the right to buy other real and personal, to make contracts and agreements and to borrow funds which shall promote and make possible the furthering of the above stated objectives and also to help make this association self-supporting. The association shall also have the right to lend money on a non-profit basis to other Lithuanian organizations who are members of the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association.\\"DLHA Constitution and Bylaws\\", TD, Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Despite the redundant language of the document, it is clear that the goal of the association was to act as a non-profit umbrella group for Lithuanian organizations loyal to America and a free Lithuania. Some of the member organizations which used the hall were: The Detroit Lithuanian Organizations Centre, The Detroit Chapter of the Lithuanian Journalists, The Detroit Chapter of the Lithuanian American Committee of the USA, Inc., The Lithuanian Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the Lithuanian Sport Club \\"Kovas\\", and the Baltic Nations Committee of Detroit, Inc.A.O. Deksnis to Lithuanian Home Association, LS, 30 June 1967, Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library.\\"Various correspondence\\", TD, The Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. A letter of thanks from the chairman of the Baltic Nations Committee indicates that many of these groups used the facilities free of charge, depending on the purpose of the use. For a Commemoration of Mass Deportations, the Baltic Nations Committee paid only two dollars and fifty cents to cover the cost of paper table cloths. Although the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association had relationships with many Detroit organizations, it is clear that its most important relationship was with the Dariaus and Gireno Club. After completing the purchase of the Bohemian National Hall, alterations separated the barroom from the rest of the facilities, allowing the Dariaus and Gineno Club to obtain a private social club designation (501c4) and establish themselves at a separate address within the building. The club became the number one source of income for the Detroit Lithuanian Home Association, paying rent for the bar space and donating the majority of the bar's profit to the association. For example, the D & G Club made a profit of $24,340.00 from 1963 to 1965, but donated $20,367.00 of those profits, most of it to the DLHA.\\"Profit and Loss Statements\\", TD, 1963‚Äì1965, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library, Detroit. In addition, the D & G club passed a rule that only members who donated $100.00 to the DLHA could work behind the bar.\\"Officers Meeting Minutes\\", TD, 1965 and 1966, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. The D & G Club also supported other Lithuanian organizations. The minutes of officers' meetings held during 1965 and 1966 detail donations made to various Lithuanian schools in Detroit, The Lithuanian-American Council, The Lithuanian Boy Scouts, The Lithuanian Student Organization, Lithuanian Independence Commemoration, The Lithuanian March on the United Nations, the Lithuanian Radio Program and the Lithuanian Relief Fund, a group which helped 30,000 displaced Lithuanians resettle in Detroit. The club also helped with the funeral expenses of its members, paid for sympathy notices and flowers, kept an annual subscription to three Lithuanian language newspapers, and sponsored the \\"Kovas\\" Basketball team. It held annual banquets for the 4th of July, Easter, and Christmas Eve and paid for masses at St. Anthony to commemorate the deaths of Dariaus and Gireno.\\"Officers Meeting Minutes\\", TD, 1965 and 1966. In addition to playing a central role in the local Lithuanian community, the D & G Klubas and the DLHA also played an active role in local, national and international affairs. For example, the DLHA hosted Michigan Governor George W. Romney at an anniversary banquet held at the hall.George Romney to Jonas Gaizutis, Pres., Lithuanian Hall, Inc., L, 23 October 1964, Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library; \\"Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Anniversary Booklet 1962-1967\\", 1967. Dr. Vytautas Mileris, President of both organizations in the late 1960s, wrote a letter in support of the nomination of Jerome Zielinski to the board of the Export-Import Bank.Dr. Vytautas Mileris to Lyndon B Johnson, TL, 27 February 1968, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library; Philip Hart to [Dr. Vytautas Mileris], TL, 29 February 1968, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. In addition, the members of both groups were part of a sustained letter writing campaign to help pass House Congressional Resolution 416, a bill that called for freedom for the Baltic States.\\"Packet from Americans for Congressional Action to Free the Baltic States\\", TD, 2 January 1969, Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Although the first five years in the Bohemian National Home were full of activities including concerts, dramas, lectures, art shows and dances, things began to change in 1967. In June of that year, the DLHA received correspondence from the Internal Revenue Service which denied its application for non-profit status (501c3), making donations to the organization ineligible for tax deduction.Gaubis Bookkeeping Service to [Internal Revenue Service], Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library, Detroit. Also in 1967, the city experienced the unprecedented devastation of the 1967 Detroit riot. The membership lists of the D & G Klubas show a steady decrease in membership from 1967, when there were 321 dues-paying members, to 1977, when there were only 120 dues-paying members.\\"Membership Lists\\", TD, 1967‚Äì1977, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Decay began to manifest itself in the surrounding neighborhood and by 1969, the DLHA had paid to tear down four abandoned houses.Vytautas Mileris to Whom it May Concern, TLS, 15 December 1969, Detroit Lithuanian Home Association Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. In 1970, it appears that the situation in the neighborhood was worsening. In a letter to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission, the club requests permission to put an interior door connecting the bar to the main facilities. The club gives as reason for the request: the neighborhood outside is old and run down and there have been a number of incidents where our members have been robbed, beaten or harassed. Many members feel it is dangerous to go outside the club which they have to do every time they want to get to the rest of the building.Dariaus and Gireno Club to Michigan Liquor Control Commission, TL, 6 March 1970, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. A police report dated July 15, 1974, seems to confirm the dreary picture painted by the letter to the MLCC. Responding to a break-in and robbery at the hall, officers used a K-9 unit to track a suspect to a nearby house on 23rd Street (one block away) where the officers recovered a number of stolen items, including the bar television, a cash register and 40 bottles of liquor.\\"Police Report\\", TD, 15 July 1974, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. Another robbery in 1975 led the club to hire a patrol service starting in 1976.\\"Profit and Loss Statement\\", TD, 1975‚Äì1976, Dariaus and Gireno Club Papers, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library. The year 1983 was the last time that the DLHA was issued a business license for the hall. Yearly donations from the D & G Klubas had shrunk from the thousands of dollars donated in the 1960s to a total of forty five dollars for the entire year of 1977. For the remainder of the 1980s, the main hall was almost vacant, with little to no activity on a daily basis. The only part of the building that was still used daily was the barroom that was a favorite gathering spot for a handful of Lithuanian World War II Vets. In 1996, the Bohemian National Home was bought by a local historic preservation grad student, who remains part of the ownership to this day. Multicultural Detroit period (1996-Present) After buying the Bohemian National Home from the Lithuanians in 1996, the new owner was in the process of removing multiple layers of graffiti from its exterior walls when a neighborhood resident struck up a conversation. \\"What are you going to do with that building?\\" she asked . After explaining that he intended to renovate the building as a multi-media, multi-cultural community center that would be available for use by the neighborhood and other local Detroit organizations, the neighbor seemed more comfortable and began to open up. \\"Those people who were here before you were racist pigs\\", the woman stated. \\"Oh really,\\" he replied, \\"and why do you think that?\\" Although unable to point to any specific instances of racist activity, she insisted that they must have been racists because they \\"stayed to themselves\\" and didn't invite the other neighborhood residents to any of their functions. He made a brief attempt to explain that most non-English speaking immigrant communities in the United States experienced similar periods of self-imposed isolation as they underwent assimilation and that it was a desire to preserve their native language and culture that most often led them to \\"stay to themselves\\". Although his sidewalk attempt to share some basic immigration history with the woman seemed to fall on deaf ears, the encounter, and many more like it, made two things very clear. First, that there was an almost complete lack of communication and understanding between the most recent occupants of the building and the African American residents of the neighborhood. The \\"word on the street\\" varied from a belief that they were ex-Nazis (particularly strange given the dedication of the club to two Lithuanians shot down by the Nazis), to a group of mobsters, but no one he spoke with could say what nationality they were or how they came to be in the neighborhood. The story of an entire local community of immigrants seemed at risk of being lost in rumour and speculation . It seemed appropriate to allow a bit of historical research to reveal more of the truth (some of which, comprise the \\"Bohemian and Lithuanian Periods\\" of this entry). Second, any redevelopment and reuse plans for the Bohemian National Home would have to somehow include the surrounding neighborhood. The hall is one of five sizable, non-residential buildings interspersed in the residential blocks of the neighborhood, and the residents feel a sense of ownership of these spaces. The other four buildings include two churches, a parochial school, and a church convent converted into offices for Core-City Neighborhoods, a non-profit community organization. All four of these building afford some level of access to the neighborhood residents. None of these buildings have a problem with graffiti or vandalism. The Bohemian National Home, on the other hand, was, in 1996, replete with graffiti and signs of vandalism. The area around the hall was the worst block in the neighborhood and had a disproportionate amount of vacant lots and vacant houses. Illegal drug sales and related activities occurred around the clock and the building had been the target of scavengers who steal copper piping, wiring and any other item that can be turned into a few quick dollars. The current owner fought off two very serious attempts to \\"bust open\\" the Bohemian National Home to the scavengers, and then decided that the only way to preserve it from the landfill, was to assume the role of steward, for better or worse. Although the hall has the physical presence of a public building, it had been inaccessible to surrounding residents of other cultures, leading to resentment, misunderstanding and a lack of the kind of public stewardship exhibited by the neighborhood toward the other large buildings. At that time of the 1996 purchase from the Lithuanians, the hall and the vacant land around it represented a large void in the fabric of the neighborhood. The result was an environment in which illicit activity flourished, creating a nuisance for the entire neighborhood. = Youth programming = Youth programs conducted on a frequent basis by the National Home include the Bohemian Kids Improv Troupe, the Michigan Avenue Mural Project, and the Music Appreciation Program. = Music programming = From 1996 to 2005, the Bohemian National Home hosted a variety of events, fundraisers, parties, weddings, etc. The hall also became well known on the Electronic Music Circuit and hosted Techno DJs from around the world. These events proved invaluable to stabilizing the building from further deterioration. From 2005 to 2008 the Bohemian National Home operated under the direction of musician/booker/promoter Joel Peterson. Artists that played the Bohemian National Home during that time period include Blowfly, Ken Vandermark, Joe McPhee and Trio X, The Evens, Sam Rivers, Eugene Chadbourne, Noah Howard, Human Eye, Faruq Z Bey, Paal Nilssen-Love, Rhys Chatham, Mary Halvorson, Peter Walker, Jack Rose, Odu Afrobeat Orchestra, Daniel Higgs, Cooper-Moore and Assif Tsahar, Magik Markers, Henry Grimes, Charles Gayle, Extra Golden, Rising Star Drum and Fife Band, Tara Jane O'Neil, Roy Campbell, Josephine Foster, Salim Washington, Growing, William Parker, Nautical Almanac, Tatsuya Nakatani, Thollem McDonas, Trevor Watts, Jimmy Carl Black, The Bird Dogs (who became the Rue Moor Counts), Mats Gustafsson and Awesome Color. Since 2008, under the new leadership of Musician in Residence, Charles Buddy Smith, the Bohemian National Home continues to host music in its many forms. Some of the recent visits include John Sinclair and the Blues Scholars, Pink Eye Orchestra, Duende, Ron English Ensemble, Wardell Montgomery, Gardens, Hot Damn, Carjack, Oatmeal, Chris Kennington, Woodman, Black Lodge, Oblisk, Mother Whale, The Oscillating Fan Club, Indian Guides, Marco Polo and the New Vaccines, RJ Spangler, Phil Hale Harmonics, Thornetta Davis, Red China, Arrogant Bastards, Mantons, Blue Song, Bill Harris, Glen Allen, Jura, The Summer Pledge, Josh Dahlberg, Kevin Reynolds, Root Bear, Buddy Smith, Derek Plaslaiko, Green Room Rockers, Jeff Grand, Paul Carey, and 1592. Music performances generally take place either in Klubas Coffeehouse (which is housed in the original barroom), The Library, which is an intimate space adjoining the barroom on the first floor, or The Ballroom which takes up of the second floor. = Visual arts = The Bohemian National Home Gallery was curated by Detroit artist Jerome Ferretti from 2005 to 2008. The Gallery is currently (as of May, 2009) curated by Artist in Residence, Juan Carlos Hearn. = Annual festivals = July 2006 marked First Annual Bohemian National Home Festival of Jazz and Improvised music. The inaugural festival featured jazz legend Sam Rivers as well groups ranging from Free improvisation to Cuban Jazz. The 2007 Festival featured Noah Howard, Sabir Mateen, Craig Taborn, Gerald Cleaver, Charles Waters, and the legendary Sun Ra Arkestra led by Marshall Allen. The 2008 Festival happened during the last weekend in May and featured Matthew Shipp, Joe Morris, Ellery Eskelin, Eugene Chadbourne, and Trevor Watts. Unfortunately, this wonderful festival will no longer take place at the Bohemian National Home. The first annual May Day Festival, sponsored by John Sinclair and Pink Eye Orchestra, was introduced in May 2009. The second annual John Sinclair Birthday Weekend will be held in early October 2009 and showcases the incredible music talent still being incubated in Detroit.

Sometimes called a goose neck, a stem's design belongs to either a quill or threadless system, and each system is compatible with respective headset and fork designs: * Quill: the stem inserts into the steerer tube, which is threaded and does not extend above the headset. * Threadless: the stem clamps around the steerer tube, which is not threaded and extends above the headset. Quill versus threadless Although stems are commonly referred to as being of either the quill or threaded type, the thread in question is the one on the fork steerer tube. Quill stems require a steerer tube of the same length as the headset and head tube combined and thus must be matched to the specific bicycle model. Threadless systems use an unthreaded steerer tube, which extends into the stem and may be cut to length as desired in order to accommodate the height of the headset, head tube, stem and any spacers used to adjust the handlebar height. Quill systems predate threadless systems. With the advent of threadless stems, manufacturers no longer need to provide a range of threaded forks for a given model; all threadless system forks are made with the same length steerer tube (long). The steerer tubes are then cut to length to fit upon installation. Unthreaded forks often require less labor to swap than threaded forks. =Quill stems= Quill stems showing wedge-shaped (on left) and cone-shaped (on right) expander nuts. The older of the two handlebar stem styles, quill types have been largely displaced as the industry standard on sport bikes. However, they remain standard on the majority of utility bikes, regardless of price, as well as on less expensive sport bikes and higher-end retro bikes. The quill stem requires the threaded steerer tube of the fork to extend up through the headset but not protrude beyond it. The quill stem fits down into the inside of the top of steerer tube and is held in place by either a wedge- shaped nut and bolt or a cone-shaped expander nut and bolt. In the case of a wedge-shaped nut, the bottom of the stem is cut diagonally to match the wedge and the bolt pulls the wedge against the stem to expand against the inside of the steerer tube and hold the stem in place. In the case of an expander nut, the bottom of the stem is cut perpendicular to its length and also has two slits cut parallel to its length. The cone-shaped expander nut is pulled upwards by the bolt causing the sides of the stem to spread and press against the inside of the steerer tube to hold it in place.

File:One piece stem and handlebar.JPGOne-piece quill stem and handlebar. File:Schaftvorbauten.jpgVariations in available stem length. =Threadless stems= Threadless stems, the newer of the two styles, are widely popular and have displaced quill stems as the industry standard on sport bikes. Threadless stems feature a modular design where the stem clamps around the outside of the top of the fork steerer tube that protrudes above the headset. Threadless stems are commonly available in lengths up to about 130 millimeters (5 inches). With threadless stems, a \\"star-nut\\" is driven down into the threadless steerer tube and held in place by two barbed flanges. The top cap bolts into, and pulls against, the star-nut, thereby preloading the headset bearings. (See: photograph of Star-nut) Newer model forks, with carbon fiber steerer tubes, use an expander plug instead of a star nut, which once installed serves the same purpose as the star nut, but will not damage carbon fiber forks as a starnut will (by design a star-nut digs into the surrounding tube, which, while safe with aluminum, can weaken carbon fiber to the point of failure). Special adaptors may allow a threaded fork to receive a threadless stem. Image:Shimano 105-5500 shifters.jpgA threadless stem with a removable face plate on a racing bicycle holding drop handlebars.

Image:Mountain Bike Stem.jpgThreadless stem with a removable face plate on a mountain bike. Image:Adjustable threadless stem.JPGAdjustable threadless stem with a removable face plate. =Advantages of each type= Threadless advantages: * Threadless stems offer a simple way to swap, flip, mix, and match stems, which are readily available in various configurations and variations of construction, color, reach, and angle. * Threadless stems allow for the lighter carbon fiber or aluminum alloy steerer tubes, and hence a lighter overall bicycle. * Threadless stems can be changed with a single allen wrench. (Some quill stems also use a single allen wrench.) * The threadless stem's centering can be adjusted without disturbing the handlebar height. * Threadless stems avoid the internal binding or seizing possible with a quill stem's wedge or cone bolt. Quill advantages: * Quill stems offer the ability to make fine adjustments to handlebar height. * Quill stems can simply be raised, especially examples with long shafts. To raise or lower a threadless headset beyond predetermined (spacer) increments requires another stem. * Quill stems may offer a slender, smoother appearance compared to the multi-piece, jointed appearance of a threadless stem. * Quill stems can be removed without disrupting the headset. Stem construction = Materials = Stems are often constructed of aluminum alloy, but are also available in steel, titanium, carbon fiber, and aluminum alloy wrapped in carbon fiber. =Handlebar attachment= Stems tighten around and hold the handlebar either by pinch bolts, which require 'feeding' the handlebar through the stem after removing controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable faceplates, also called pillow blocks, especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a handlebar with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with faceplates or pillow blocks are known as pop-top stems. =Dimensions= Stems normally have two dimensions that affect bicycle fit: an angle and a forward length or extension. Quill stems may also have a height (above minimum insertion mark). Stems must also be compatible with the dimensions of the components that they connect, namely the handlebar clamp diameter and steerer tube diameter. = Angle = For road quill stems, the angle is normally 73¬∞ which causes the extension of the stem to be nearly parallel with the ground. Some quill stems also have other angles, e.g. 90¬∞, which results in the stem pointing forwards and upwards. Newer style stems for threadless headsets come in a wide variety of angles from 0¬∞ to 40¬∞ and can be flip-flopped, or inverted so that the angle is up or down. So, for example, a 17¬∞ stem angled downward would mimic the angle of the typical road quill stem. There are also models of quill and threadless stems with adjustable angles, although this adjustability often comes at the expense of some lost rigidity. = Length = The length of the stem determines how far forward of the steerer tube the handlebars are. = Minimum insertion (quill stem) = Quill stems each require a minimum length which must insert into the headset steerer tube, thereby determining a maximum length that may extend above steerer tube. = Steerer tube diameter = A stem must be compatible with the dimensions of the fork steerer tube. Steerer tubes come mainly in two common nominal sizes: 1\\" and 1\\". Less commonly 1\\" was used on some mountain bikes and tandems and has now returned on some carbon fiber forks, and 1\\" is found on high end Downhill bikes. A threadless stem should match the outside diameter of the steer tube; a reducing shim may be employed to match a 1\\" stem to a 1\\" steer tube. On the other hand, a quill stem must be sized to match the inner diameter of the steer tube. Thus a quill stem made to fit a 1\\" steer tube has an outer diameter of 1\\". For 1\\" steer tubes the quill diameter is most often \\" (22.2 mm) but some older American bicycles used 21.15 mm. Some older French bicycles used 25 mm steer tubes with 22 mm diameter quill stems. = Handle bar diameter = Both quill and threadless stems come in a variety of bicycle handlebar clamp diameters. The ISO standard for the clamping area of a handlebar is 25.4 mm (1 inch), which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is 26.0 mm, which is the most common clamp size for road bars. There are also intermediate sizes such as 25.8 mm to try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli- specific size of 26.4 mm. In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates allow for slight differences in handlebar clamp diameter, but the older type of stem with a single pinch bolt must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its \\"7\\" shape, but nowadays it can be hard to tell the difference between a \\"road\\" (26.0 mm) and \\"MTB\\" (25.4 mm) stem. Manufacturers frequently omit the clamp size from advertising or packaging. BMX bikes usually have a 22.2 mm diameter clamp size. A more recent standard is a 31.8 mm (1.25\\") clamp for both MTB and road bars. This is rapidly taking over from the previous mix of sizes, although other accessories such as some light or computer brackets may also need to be oversized to fit the thicker bars. Standard brake levers can be used as it is only the stem clamp central section that is oversized. Shims are available to fit a 31.8 mm stem to either a 25.4 mm or 26.0 mm bar, so many new models of stems are oversize-only. = Attachments = Some stems have a hole through the horizontal part to support the front brake cable on bikes with cantilever brakes such as cyclo-cross bicycles and older mountain bikes. Variations =Adjustable= Certain uncommon adjustable stems have the handlebar clamp unit mounted on a moveable slide, permitting variable fore and aft settings. This adjustable stem was developed by a famous cyclist, Major Taylor, hence they are sometimes called Major Taylor Outriggers. = Suspension = An elastomer suspension quill stem. Softride parallelogram suspension quill stem. At one time, some manufacturers (Softride) marketed suspension stems. Softride's stem allowed for up to 3 inches of travel, used a parallelogram linkage, and used a polymer bushing and a steel coil spring for shock absorption. = Tandem stoker stem = The stem for the stoker (rear rider) on a tandem is similar to a stem for a threadless fork and headset, but clamps on the captain's (front rider's) seatpost. This type of stem may be adjustable in length with one section of tubing telescoping into another.

It aims to address the relational and psychological dimensions that occur in tandem with physical illness, with an attempt to deal with the individual stories of patients. In doing this, narrative medicine aims not only to validate the experience of the patient, but also to encourage creativity and self-reflection in the physician. Two first year medical students at Lewis Katz School of Medicine writing/journaling about their experiences in the hospital. History In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created the Flexner Report, which set out to redefine medical educational practices. In this report, it argued that the proper goal of medicine is \\"to attempt to fight the battle against disease.\\" Flexner wrote that \\"the practitioner deals with facts of two categories. Chemistry, physics, biology enable him to apprehend one set; he needs a different apperceptive and appreciative apparatus to deal with the other more subtle elements. Specific preparation is in this direction much more difficult; one must rely for the requisite insight and sympathy on a varied and enlarging cultural experience.\\" In the late 20th century the emergence of narrative medicine came as an effort to re-emphasize an aspect of wider cultural elements in medicine. One prominent medical school that first began a program on narrative medicine was Columbia University Medical Center with their opening of the first Program in Narrative Medicine. Built within their College of Physicians and Surgeons, they believe that narrative medicine can make profound changes to the way medical treatment is administered: Rita Charon has been the executive director of this program and has published and lectured on the benefits of doctors receiving narrative training as a way to increase empathy and reflection in the medical professional field. From the 1990s, physicians like Rachel Naomi Remen and Rita Charon argued that medical practice should be structured around the narratives of patients. Educational programs A number of schools in the United States offer advanced classes in narrative medicine. * The Columbia University Medical Center has been the leading pioneer of developing educational programs for the field of narrative medicine. In addition to lectures and seminars given throughout the year, Columbia University created the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program for graduate students in 2009, making it one of the first graduate programs devoted strictly to narrative medicine.\\"Learning to Listen\\" New York Times (2009-12-29) *The Lewis Katz School of Medicine has a Narrative Medicine Program run by Mike Vitez, a Pulitzer-winning journalist, and Naomi Rosenberg, an Emergency Medicine physician. It launched in 2016. The program's goal is to protect, support, and nourish the humanism that brings physicians into the profession, and to teach the skills of narrative that help at the bedside and beyond. The program has curricular and extracurricular components. Reflective writing forms a significant component of the Professional Identity Formation thread in the MD curriculum. Electives in medical humanities range from exploration of narrative medicine to photo storytelling to improvisational acting. Students also conceive and complete individual or group projects for elective credit under the guidance of the faculty. Extracurricular activities include a wide array of writing and narrative medicine workshops‚Äîsome led by students‚Äîfor students, residents, and hospital staff. ‚ÄúNarrative Medicine Talks‚Äù is a regular speaker series, and the program hosts fall and spring Story Slams for the Lewis Katz School of Medicine and Temple Hospital Community. On December 7, 2019, LKSOM hosted its inaugural Narrative Medicine Conference. * Montefiore Medical Center is the academic medical center and University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This medical center created a program in Narrative Medicine as a subset of the Department of Family and Social Medicine. Residents at this school attend programs where they learn how to use personal narrative to enhance empathy, as well as topics including stress, loss, and balance. * The Ohio State University Humanities Institute is also supporting the multidisciplinary initiative of narrative medicine. This program runs concurrently with their other undergraduate and graduate programs, where students \\"strive to develop narrative competence that enables them to deliver care that is not only more empathetic and compassionate, but also more effective.\\" * The University of California Irvine College of Medicine has created an Integrative Medicine Program within the Department of Family Medicine. This program \\"strives to change the focus of healthcare and medical education for our residents, medical students and faculty to include a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach that emphasizes wellness, prevention, and self-care skills, and the adoption of the principles for creating optimal healing environments.\\" * In 2011, Western University created the Narrative Medicine Initiative (NMI) and has incorporated narrative medicine into the undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education departments. They work to answer questions such as \\"How does the art of storytelling improve health care education and the experience of patient care?\\". Western holds regular (at least annual) Narrative medicine rounds where local patients and physicians share their stories of disease and illness, with a focus on how the stories will improve physician's ability to handle future stories. * Lenoir-Rhyne University has established the Thomas Wolfe Center for Narrative, with the slogan \\"Heeding the call for narrative in a fragmented world.\\" This program offers graduate-level and certification courses in several narrative training disciplines, one of which is narrative medicine. * Saybrook University takes a broad approach to narrative medicine through their mind-body medicine program. This seeks to approve the mind-body approach to health and wellness as a way to improve quality of life for patients. * Misericordia University requires a course in narrative medicine for all students in their Medical and Health Humanities major. This growing field of narrative medicine extends beyond the United States: * The British Medical Journal began adding their own writing seminars to promote this type of narrative in its emerging physicians. * At University of Southern Denmark narrative medicine is a mandatory course to follow for all undergraduate medical students.

Plot summary The story is narrated by the young Melvin Spellbound who joins his eccentric Uncle Borgel and pet dog Fafner on an interglalactuc adventure involving time travel and multiple alternate realities. Travelling along the Interstate Highway connecting the various realities, Borgel is separated from the others by a mischievous teleportation (called a 'bilbok'), and Melvin and Fafner stranded at a roadside root beer stand. Having waited for him, Melvin and Fafner take control of his car, and recover Borgel en route. Thereafter the three rest at a public campsite, where they acquire a new companion in 'Pak Nfbnm*', alias 'Freddie': a self-professed expert on popsicles, in search of an immortal 'Great Popsicle' whose existence maintains the integrity of the Universe. Pursuing that search, they receive directions from a computer made in the image of the Popsicle, to the anthropomorphic gorilla 'Glugo', who conveys them to an island on the River Styx. There, and elsewhere, Freddie is identified as a Grivnizoid, a shape-changing, cephalopod-like predator, desirous of achieving insurmountable power. Can they stop Freddie in time and save the world? Controversy An excerpt from Borgel was used as a question in a New York State test for 8th grade students in 2012. The question caused controversy over it's nonsensical nature leading stumping both students and teachers as to the correct answers. The confusion led to articles in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and other publications. In the original novel, Uncle Borgel tells another absurd fable about a eggplant and a rabbit having a race. The New York state exam changed the characters to a pineapple and a rabbit and then asked students a series of ambiguous multiple choice questions based on the story.

Other cases he pursued included one against Saddam Hussein, who was the object of an international campaign initiated in 1995 by Mallat with officials in Kuwait, London and Washington that developed into INDICT, a nongovernmental organisation he helped found in Britain in 1996. By 1998, INDICT had received open support in the American Congress and in the British Parliament, and was embraced by then US President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.Paul Vaugh, 'Britain campaigns to indict Saddam', The Independent, 2 December 1998. The campaign laid the ground for a case against Saddam Hussein in Belgium in 2002, and his eventual trial in Iraq in 2005. A third case was won against Muammar Gaddafi in Beirut courts for the families of the historic leader of the Shi'i community Musa al-Sadr and his two companions, journalist Abbas Badreddin and cleric Muhammad Ya\`qub, who disappeared in Libya upon their official invitation by Gaddafi in August 1978.Extensive coverage of the case at Imam Sadr Center. Mallat also helped establish the Middle East regional office of Amnesty International in Beirut in 1999 for which his law firm has acted since as legal counsel. Led by directors Kamel Labidi and Ahmad Karaoud, both former prisoners of opinion in Tunisia, the regional office formed an inspiring precedent to a multitude of civil society organizations across the Middle East focusing on the promotion of human rights, accountability, and the abolition of the death penalty. Founded by his father Wajdi Mallat in Beirut in 1949, Mallat Law Offices is one of the oldest law firms in the Middle East, recognized for important successes in domestic litigation, including succession and estates, administrative, and business law.http://www.mallat.com The practise continued and was developed internationally upon Mallat's return to Beirut from London in 1995. In addition to victims of mass crime, the firm's clients include governments, embassies, multi-national companies and business and political leaders. =Academic career= Educated in Lebanon, the United States and Europe, Mallat received his PhD from the law department of London University's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in 1990. He held research and teaching positions at the University of California Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1984-85 and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, where as a lecturer in Islamic Law he received his first tenured position in 1992. He taught at the Islamic University in Lebanon in 1995-96, and was twice visiting professor at the University of Lyon and at the University of Virginia School of Law. He was also Senior Schell Fellow at Yale Law School‚Äôs International Human Rights Center and a Kluge scholar at the Library of Congress. In 2000, he received professorial tenure at Saint Joseph University (USJ) in Lebanon and was appointed a year later to the first EU Jean Monnet Chair in European Law in the Middle East. In 2004, the EU Commission bestowed its 'Center of Excellence' label to the Chair and the Directorate-General of the Education and Culture at the EU Commission honored it as 'A Success Story' in 2007.Jean Monnet Success Stories Europe for Lifelong Learning, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2007 In 2006-2007, he spent one year at Princeton University where he was a Visiting Professor at the Woodrow Wilson School, Fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs, Fellow in the University Center for Human Values, Fellow in the Program in International and Regional Studies and a Distinguished Visitor in the Bobst Center for Peace and Justice. A tenured professor of Middle Eastern Politics and Law at the University of Utah since 2007 and Presidential Professor since 2009, Mallat was appointed in 2011 Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Visiting Professor of Islamic Legal Studies at Harvard Law School. He taught in Fall 2012 at Yale Law School as Visiting Professor of Law and Oscar M. Ruebhausen Distinguished Senior Fellow. In Spring 2015, he was a Visiting Professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris. In 2017, he resigned his full-time positions at Saint Joseph's University and at the University of Utah, but remained on the University of Utah's law faculty as Professor. =Human rights and politics= Mallat has been active in human rights and democratic advocacy since his high school days. His main focus since 1982 was Iraq as key to change in the Middle East, and he founded the International Committee for a Free Iraq (ICFI) in 1991 with Edward Mortimer and Ahmad Chalabi to seek the end of dictatorship in Baghdad.A.M. Rosenthal, 'On my mind: Praying in London', The New York Times, 25 June 1991 The ICFI brought together about a hundred Iraqi and international personalities, including leading US senators like Claiborne Pell, then Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and John McCain, as well as British MP David Howell, then chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, and respected Arab public figures like Saad Eddin Ibrahim and Adonis.Mallat, ‚ÄòVoices of opposition: The International Committee for a Free Iraq‚Äô, in E. Goldberg, R. Kasaba and J. Migdal eds., Rules and Rights in the Middle East: Democracy, Law and Society, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1993; Mallat, 'Claiborne Pell and the roots of Iraqi regime change', The Daily Star, 13 January 2010 Many of the Committee's Iraqi members became the leaders of Iraq after the end of Baathist dictatorship in 2003, including Mohammed Bahr al-Uloum as the first president of the Iraqi Governing Council, Jalal Talibani as president and Hoshyar Zebari as Foreign Minister. Mallat was opposed to the US-led invasion, and sought with the support of then US Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz an alternative Security Council Resolution that would have declared Saddam Hussein's presidency illegitimate and advocated the deployment of human rights monitors in Iraq during the transition to democracy.See statement of Wolfowitz in 'Senior Defense Officials Interview with Chris Core, WMAL Radio', 4 March 2003 ; Text of UNSCR draft and generally on 'the Democratic Iraq Initiative' in Mallat, Iraq: Guide to Law and Policy, Kluwer, Boston 2009, 'The March to War', 209-31; on human rights monitors deployment, Id. at 150. He visited Iraq in late 2003 and early 2004 to accelerate the recognition of the Iraqi Governing Council as the official government of Iraq, a move opposed by Paul Bremer and Kofi Annan.Mallat, 'Note to the U.N.: Hands Off Iraqi Politics', The New York Times, 19 January 2004 ; Mallat, 'The record of UN apparatchiks and what can no longer be accepted in Iraq', The Daily Star, 12 June 2003 . In 2005, he declined the Iraqi government's invitation to head the tribunal that eventually tried Saddam Hussein. In 2008-10, Mallat was senior legal advisor to the Global Justice Project: Iraq, which he initiated with Hiram Chodosh, the dean of the law school at the University of Utah. The large team of scholars, operating as legal think-tank in Baghdad, advised the Iraqi government on legislation, constitutional review, and treaties. Mallat was invited to sit on the Constitutional Review Committee led by Humam Hamoudi, and completed with the Committee a revision of the Constitution in October 2009. In Summer 2014, he helped the Iraqi president Fouad Masum and Parliamentary Speaker Salim al-Jabouri construct the constitutional argument that put an end to the Prime Ministership of Nouri al-Maliki.\\"Kalam alnass\\", aired LBCI television August 14, 2014, ŸÉŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®Ÿäÿ±Ÿàÿ™ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ®ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿØ . In 2016, he helped found Humanist Lebanon, organizing regular demonstrations in the centre of Beirut to end the presidential void in the name of the Constitution. =Presidential campaign= In his native Lebanon, Mallat ran for president in 2005-2006 in an unprecedented challenge to the incumbent, Emile Lahoud, who had relied on the Damascus government of Bashar al-Asad to force an unconstitutional extension of his mandate. During the Cedar Revolution which was triggered by the assassination of the president's main opponent, Rafiq al-Hariri, Mallat was active in street protests and in the leadership,\\"Le refus de l'impunit√©: CHEBLI MALLAT, AVOCAT D'AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ET PROFESSEUR √Ä L'UNIVERSIT√â SAINT-JOSEPH\\", Le Monde, 30 March 2005, http://www.lemonde.fr/import/article/2005/03/30/le-refus-de-l- impunite_633496_3544.html?xtmc=chebli_mallat&xtcr;=2 where his central advocacy was the establishment of an international, hybrid tribunal to arrest and try the assassins of Hariri and scores of other victims - eventually known as the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, and the removal of the 'coercively- extended president' from power.'Mallat, 2221- Lebanon's Cedar Revolution, an Essay on Nonviolence and Justice, Beirut, Lir, 2007, 88, also available at . Mallat's campaign was initiated in November 2005 to push a fractured and direction-less revolution towards its active materialisation in a presidency 'that looked like the people who made it.'See for instance, speech at Restaurant Al Dente, 3 February 2006, Bayrut fi khabar al-mustaqbal (Beirut in a future mode), reproduced in Presidential Talk, Beirut, Dar al-Jadid, 2007, also available at . Denigrated by some as 'quixotic', the campaign was received in the local, regional and international media as a breakthrough for Arab democracy in its direct, people-based nonviolent challenge to dictators for life.Some thirty profiles were published, including in Newsweek, the Financial Times, The New York Times, Voice of America, the main Arab papers, Der Standard (Austria), and others. Mallat appeared in leading television interviews, including the BBC Hardtalk, CNN Larry King , Kalam al-Nas (LBCI), transcript in English here , Niqtat Hiwar (al-‚ÄòArabiyya). A sample of the interviews and profiles was published in A Compelling Presidency: The Mallat Campaign in World News, Beirut, April 2006. Over a period of seven months, Mallat's team took its message to several cities and villages of Lebanon, and was supported by unprecedented mobilisation of the Lebanese diaspora, especially in the US. Internationally, the campaign culminated in a Security Council Presidential Statement that undermined the legitimacy of Emile Lahoud, and translated in a mass popular meeting on 14 March 2006 with a single motto: 'Lahoud must go'.Mallat, Lahoud must go for Lebanon to progressFinancial Times, 7 June 2005, also available here . Mallat campaign Press Release Commemoration rally of PM Hariri's murder sends message: Lahoud must go , 14 March 2006 As 'the primary architect' of Lahoud's demise, Mallat joined with the leadership of the March 14 coalition to develop his constitutional, nonviolent plan to replace Lahoud by a freely elected president.Plan presented at the Bristol meeting of the full leadership of the March 14 coalition on February 16, 2006. Details in ‚Äúal-'amaliyya al-dusturiyya (the constitutional process)‚Äù, in Presidential Talks, 188-9. See in English Mallat, Here‚Äôs how to get rid of Emile Lahoud, The Daily Star, 4 March 2006; Despite his agreement at the time with key Lebanese 14 March leaders, especially Walid Jumblat, his plan was scuttled by their hesitation, and by the pro-Syrian speaker's call for a dialogue in which presidential change was drowned amongst several secondary issues. With the political deadlock that ensued, Mallat predicted a new bout of 'immense violence' descending on the country.Mallat, \\"31 May 2006:[Coming] War announced‚Äù, Speech at Saint-Joseph‚Äôs University,31 May 2006, in Presidential Talks, pp. 21-27. When the war against Israel was triggered by Hizbullah on 12 July 2006, Mallat was forced to interrupt his campaign on the ground. He denounced the attack of Hizbullah and debated its foreign affairs representative on television in the midst of the bombardments. Soon after the ceasefire, which he had helped engineer through an active collaboration with the Lebanese government‚Äôs acting foreign minister, he accepted an offer by Princeton University and left for the US with his family. At Princeton, he completed six books, including two on the campaign.See under Publications and Books from the presidential campaign =Middle East Nonviolent Revolution= Mallat remains actively engaged for Middle East democracy as scholar and activist. In pursuit of radical nonviolent change, he founded in 2009 Right to Nonviolence, an international NGO that advocates and supports nonviolence, constitutional reform and judicial accountability. Right to Nonviolence has been active in the Arab Spring, which Mallat prefers to call the 'Middle East Nonviolent Revolution' to englobe Israel and Iran.‚ÄòThe Philosophy of the Middle East Revolution, Take One: Nonviolence‚Äô, Middle East Law and Governance, 3 (2011), 136-47. As constitutional expert, he assisted with the early constitutional amendments in Egypt after the removal of Husni Mubarak.'Revising Egypt‚Äôs Constitution: A Contribution to the Constitutional Amendment Debate‚Äô, International Law Journal, published online 22 February 2011, 182-203. In February 2011, he was asked by the Bahraini leadership and opposition, and the US State Department, to assist in efforts to jumpstart the political process by producing a 'Constitutional Options' paper.'Constitutional Options in Bahrain‚Äô,(with Jason Gelbort), Virginia Journal of International Law , published online 12 April 2011, 1-16. Amidst an increase of tension on the street, the hardliners in government had decided to go for an all out repression of the Pearl Revolution. The trip to Manama to restart the dialogue was interrupted on 13 March 2011 as he was boarding the plane.Caryle Murphy, \\"Bahrain becomes flashpoint in relations between US and Saudi Arabia\\"> , The Global Post, April 13, 2011. He visited Libya and Yemen in the summer of 2012 and assisted the respective UN special envoys, Tarek Mitri and Jamal Benomar, on constitutional and accountability matters. Over the years, Mallat developed a theory of nonviolence combined with his work as a lawyer seeking justice for the most heinous political crimes known as crimes against humanity. In addition to the case against Sharon, which showed for the first time to an Arab and international audience that nonviolence may be a far more effective tool than war, he helped expand the field of judicial accountability as an important avenue for victims to stand up against dictators and bring them to account. With international action against Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Omar Bashir yielding tangible albeit uneven results, the scene was set for the trial of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak,See generally on the trial of Mubarak and his family 'Trials and judicial hearings following the 2011 Egyptian revolution' Trials and judicial hearings following the 2011 Egyptian revolution#Mubarak family; for Mallat's early call for his trial, \\"A letter from the Cedar Revolution to the Nile Revolution\\">,The Daily Star, February 7, 2011. and the falling dictators of the Middle East Revolution. He denounced the extrajudicial execution of Gaddafi, and the violent bent of the Libyan Revolution.Madeline Connors, \\"Questions Follow Gaddafi's Death\\", Harvard Crimson, October 21, 2011; Mallat, \\"Libya‚Äôs revolution: A troubling legacy of violence\\", Ahram online, August 31, 2011, With the setbacks of the revolution across the region, Mallat argued for the continued advocacy of nonviolence as the philosophy of historical change by \\"keeping the flame alive\\".Gareth Smyth, interview, \\"Chibli Mallat. 'Keeping the flame alive.'\\" The Arab Weekly, August 22, 2015. He developed a more systematic theory of nonviolence as the anima of historical change in Philosophy of Nonviolence, a book published in 2015. Writings Mallat is the author or editor of some forty books, and has published dozens of scholarly articles and book chapters.For list, see entry Chibli Mallat at Worldcat.org He is a frequent contributor to Arabic, French and English dailies and served as op-ed consultant and legal editor for The Daily Star (Beirut) in 1996-1998 and in 2009-2010. He is a regular columnist in al-Nahar (Beirut), al-Hayat (London), The Daily Star (Beirut), Al-Ahram (Cairo), L'Orient-Le Jour (Beirut), and was guest columnist in the New York Times's blog Line of Fire during the Hizbullah-Israel war in July‚ÄìAugust 2006. He views himself as the eclectic disciple of a number of twentieth century 'maverick thinkers'.Five Books Interview by Anna Blundy, 'Chibli Mallat on Maverick Political Thought', The Browser, 11 November 2009. He draws on the encyclopaedic, articulate understanding of society by French banker and sociologist Robert Fossaert;Mallat, 'Introduction √† la pens√©e de Robert Fossaert', Travaux et Jours, 82, 2009, 97-112 the conceptualisation of the courts' role in society in the works of John Hart Ely and the American constitutional tradition,‚ÄòFin-Nazariyya ad-Dusturiyya al-Amirkiyya al- Mu‚Äòasira: Robert Bork wa John Hart Ely‚Äô (On contemporary American constitutional law: Robert Bork and John Hart Ely), Proche-Orient Etudes Juridiques (Beirut, in Arabic), 1987 (published 1989), 9-26. the progressive humanism of Lebanese leader Kamal Jumblat; the aggiornamento of the Islamic legal tradition by the Iraqi Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr; and Gilles Deleuze's creative, multi-layered philosophy. =Collaborative work= Academic collaborative work has seen him serving as a joint founder and general editor of the Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, now at Brill,; ‚ÄòBuilding an intellectual monument, The Yearbook in Eugene Cotran‚Äôs legacy‚Äô, Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, Vol.13-15, 2017, 3-11 a series on 'Horizons Europ√©ens' for the Centre d'Etudes de l'Union Europ√©enne at Saint Joseph University, and a series on Islamic and Middle Eastern Law at Kluwer Law International as director of the Center of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

In 2014, he helped found and became the commissioning editor of Bada'e', a niche publishing house of books in Arabic, French and English on the Middle East. =Islamic and Middle Eastern law= In his work on Islamic and Middle Eastern law, he has engaged scholarship from the West and from the Middle East in a search for a common language of human rights and the rule of law to be conveyed from within the uniquely rich legal tradition of the Middle East from Hammurabi to the present. His first book, the of Islamic Law, which focused on the legal works of the most innovative Islamic scholar of the 20th century, the Iraqi Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, received the North America Middle East Studies Association‚Äôs annual prize, the Albert Hourani Book Award. Its Arabic version, published in 1998, circulated underground in Iraq until the demise of Saddam Hussein in 2003, and was reprinted several times since. The book was reviewed in over a hundred academic and press outlets, and revealed to the West a humanist scholarship at the highest intellectual level in Najaf. His to Middle Eastern Law, the result of twenty years of research, appeared in 2007, and expanded the field of Islamic law to include the Middle East pre-Islamic legal tradition as an important component for legal research, and to prominently feature case law as a novel and essential focus to understand the law applied in everyday's life. For the classical period of Islam, it includes archival work on the court registers systematically analysed for the first time from a legal perspective. In the modern period, the Introduction covers the main fields of law in the operation of Middle Eastern courts from Pakistan to Morocco.Nadjma Yassari, Book Review, American Journal of Comparative Law (2011),1135-1139. =European and international law= In European and international law, his writings have focused on the formation of the European Union with a particular attention to the shortcomings of the institutional structure in the EU's democratic deficit, the deadlocks of the exit mechanisms for nonconforming countries, including the Euro, and the rise of ‚Äòthe Euro-Mediterranean continent‚Äô.‚ÄòAppels d‚ÄôEurope √† l'Est de la M√©diterran√©e‚Äô, Projet, 298, Mai 2007, 68-73; ‚ÄòFederalism in the Middle East and Europe‚Äô, Case Western Journal of International Law, 35, 2003, 1-15; ‚ÄòUnion Europ√©enne et devenirs nationaux: un regard libanais‚Äô, Travaux et Jours, 67, 2001, 91-108; ‚ÄòConstitutions for the twenty-first century. Emerging patterns‚ÄîThe EU, Iraq, Afghanistan‚Äô, 2004 Herbert Bernstein lecture, 1 Duke L. CICLOPs 41 (2009) In international law, he uses the Middle East as the privileged terrain for an understanding of the interaction between international criminal law, diplomacy and politics, especially through his representation of victims of crimes against humanity in Iraq, Lebanon, Israel-Palestine and Libya. = Philosophy of Nonviolence = In his more theoretical work on law and nonviolence, Mallat seeks to articulate the difficult relation between the inherent violence of the democratic state and the search for Kantian perpetual peace. This search is informed by nonviolent practice in the 2005 Lebanese Cedar Revolution and in subsequent mass upheavals of the Middle East: from the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009 to the revolutions that began in Tunisia in January 2011. He continues to seek success in nonviolence against dictatorship through a declared involvement with oppositional leadership, human rights colleagues, and decision-makers across the world, some organised through Right to Nonviolence. His Philosophy of Nonviolence was launched in Venice at a Yale law school seminar in January 2015, and he has since engaged a varied audience in a debate on nonviolence in special lectures and seminars across the world, focusing on Arab media to disseminate the advocacy. This included daily papers, the main Syrian opposition television station and SkyArabia news in Abu Dhabi. Dedicated lectures were given in Lebanon, Switzerland,http://www.asienundeuropa.uzh.ch/events/lectureseries/reform/mallat_en.html , the US, Germany, and Malaysia. In October 2017, he collaborated with Adam Roberts and several research centers in Beirut and Tripoli to engage the public with nonviolence and civil resistance in the Arab Spring. =Literature and poetry= Mallat grew up in a family steeped in a tradition of literature and law. His namesake grandfather was known across the Arab world as 'the Poet of the Cedars'. His granduncle Tamer Mallat was a judge and a poet, whose decisions and poetry he rediscovered and published; he also edited a selection of his father's writings in a bilingual French and Arabic book. With his son Tamer, he published an illustrated book for children in 1997, Aventures a Beyrouth. Private life He is the son of Nouhad Diab and Wajdi Mallat, the first president of the Lebanese Constitutional Council (Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿØÿ≥ÿ™Ÿàÿ±Ÿä) of Lebanon, from 1994 to 1997, and has three sisters, Manal, Raya and Janane. He is married to Nayla Chalhoub, and they have two adult sons, Tamer and Wajdi.

The species exhibits marked sexual dimorphism, with males of the species exhibiting an orange color on the edges of their wings, with a burnt orange underwing. Females are dark blue, with dark, almost dusty underwings, and are also larger than males. The larvae feed on violet leaves. Dianas are unusual in that they do not lay their eggs directly on the host plant, instead scattering the eggs around the base of the plant. Upon hatching, larvae burrow into the ground over winter to emerge in spring. Adults feed on flower nectar and dung. Living specimen (male) On February 28, 2007, Act 156 of the Arkansas General Assembly designated the Diana fritillary as the official state butterfly. Introduced by Representative John Paul Wells of Logan County, the legislation for making the butterfly a state symbol took note of the butterfly's beauty, educational importance, and impact on tourism.

The passage illustrated is from the Gospel of Luke, 2:41, which states: > Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.

Hunt would also have known Bernardino Luini's version of the subject in the National Gallery. At the time this was ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci.National Gallery, Christ among the doctors. Background Obsessed with the idea of revitalising religious art by emphasising ethnographical accuracy combined with detailed Biblical symbolism, Hunt had travelled to the Middle East to create the picture, using local people as models and studying ancient Judaic customs and rituals. Progress on the painting was delayed by difficulties with models, and eventually Hunt postponed it to work on another project, The Scapegoat. He eventually completed it in 1860, back in England. His friend Frederic George Stephens wrote a pamphlet containing a detailed explanation of the content and the characters. It was then shown in a series of popular travelling exhibitions at which visitors could buy the pamphlet and subscribe to an engraved reproduction. These were organised by the dealer Ernest Gambart, and proved a great financial success.

CYN is a polycyclic uracil derivative containing guanidino and sulfate groups. It is also zwitterionic, making it highly water soluble. CYN is toxic to liver and kidney tissue and is thought to inhibit protein synthesis and to covalently modify DNA and/or RNA. It is not known whether cylindrospermopsin is a carcinogen, but it appears to have no tumour initiating activity in mice. CYN was first discovered after an outbreak of a mystery disease on Palm Island, Queensland, Australia. The outbreak was traced back to a bloom of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in the local drinking water supply, and the toxin was subsequently identified. Analysis of the toxin led to a proposed chemical structure in 1992, which was revised after synthesis was achieved in 2000. Several analogues of CYN, both toxic and non-toxic, have been isolated or synthesised. C. raciborskii has been observed mainly in tropical areas, however has also recently been discovered in temperate regions of Australia, North, South America, New Zealand and Europe. However, CYN-producing strain of C. raciborskii has not been identified in Europe, several other cyanobacteria species occurring across the continent are able to synthesize it. Discovery In 1979, 138 inhabitants of Palm Island, Queensland, Australia, were admitted to hospital, suffering various symptoms of gastroenteritis. All of these were children; in addition, 10 adults were affected but not hospitalised. Initial symptoms, including abdominal pain and vomiting, resembled those of hepatitis; later symptoms included kidney failure and bloody diarrhoea. Urine analysis revealed high levels of proteins, ketones and sugar in many patients, along with blood and urobilinogen in lesser numbers. The urine analysis, along with faecal microscopy and poison screening, could not provide a statistical link to the symptoms. All patients recovered within 4 to 26 days, and at the time there was no apparent cause for the outbreak. Initial thoughts on the cause included poor water quality and diet, however none were conclusive, and the illness was coined the ‚ÄúPalm Island Mystery Disease‚Äù. At the time, it was noticed that this outbreak coincided with a severe algal bloom in the local drinking water supply, and soon after the focus turned to the dam in question. An epidemiological study of this ‚Äúmystery disease‚Äù later confirmed that the Solomon Dam was implicated, as those that became ill had used water from the dam. It became apparent that a recent treatment of the algal bloom with copper sulfate caused lysis of the algal cells, releasing a toxin into the water. A study of the dam revealed that periodic blooms of algae were caused predominantly by three strains of cyanobacteria: two of the genus Anabaena, and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, previously unknown in Australian waters. A mouse bioassay of the three demonstrated that although the two Anabaena strains were non-toxic, C. raciborskii was highly toxic. Later isolation of the compound responsible led to the identification of the toxin cylindrospermopsin. A later report alternatively proposed that the excess copper in the water was the cause of the disease. The excessive dosing was following the use of least-cost contractors to control the algae, who were unqualified in the field. Chemistry =Structure determination= Figure 1. Initial incorrect proposed structure of cylindrospermopsin (CYN), with its four rings labelled (A-D). The incorrect feature was the orientation of the hydroxyl group. This epimer was later identified as 7-epicyclindrospermopsin. Isolation of the toxin using cyanobacteria cultured from the original Palm Island strain was achieved by gel filtration of an aqueous extract, followed by reverse-phase HPLC. Structure elucidation was achieved via mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, and a structure (later proven slightly incorrect) was proposed (Figure 1). This almost-correct molecule possesses a tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), along with a uracil ring (D). The zwitterionic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, as the presence of charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the polar solvent. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form. Figure 2. Proposed tautomerism between the keto and enol forms, showing the hydrogen bond between the uracil nitrogen and the guanidino hydrogen. =Analogues= Figure 3. Deoxycylindrospermopsin, a non-toxic metabolite of C. raciborskii A second metabolite of C. raciborskii was identified from extracts of the cyanobacteria after the observation of a frequently occurring peak accompanying that of CYN during UV and MS experiments. Analysis by MS and NMR methods concluded that this new compound was missing the oxygen adjacent to the uracil ring, and was named deoxycylindrospermopsin (Figure 3). In 1999, an epimer of CYN, named 7-epicyclindrospermopsin (epiCYN), was also identified as a minor metabolite from Aphanizomenon ovalisporum. This occurred whilst isolating CYN from cyanobacteria taken from Lake Kinneret in Israel. The proposed structure of this molecule differed from CYN only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the uracil ring (Figure 4). Figure 4. Initial proposed structure of 7-epicyclindrospermopsin (epiCYN), which was later shown to be the structure of CYN =Total synthesis= Synthetic approaches to CYN started with the piperidine ring (A), and progressed to annulation of rings B and C. The first total synthesis of CYN was reported in 2000 through a 20-step process. Improvements to synthetic methods led to a revision of the stereochemistry of CYN in 2001. A synthetic process controlling each of the six stereogenic centres of epiCYN established that the original assignments of both CYN and epiCYN were in fact a reversal of the correct structures. An alternative approach by White and Hansen supported these absolute configurations (Figure 5). At the time of this correct assignment, it was suggested that the enol form was not dominant. =Stability= One of the key factors associated with the toxicity of CYN is its stability. Although the toxin has been found to degrade rapidly in an algal extract when exposed to sunlight, it is resistant to degradation by changes in pH and temperature, and shows no degradation in either the pure solid form or in pure water. As a result, in turbid and unmoving water the toxin can persist for long periods, and although boiling water will kill the cyanobacteria, it may not remove the toxin. Toxicology =Toxic effects= Hawkins et al.. demonstrated the toxic effects of CYN by mouse bioassay, using an extract of the original Palm Island strain. Acutely poisoned mice displayed anorexia, diarrhoea and gasping respiration. Autopsy results revealed haemorrhages in the lungs, livers, kidneys, small intestines and adrenal glands. Histopathology revealed dose- related necrosis of hepatocytes, lipid accumulation, and fibrin thrombi formation in blood vessels of the liver and lungs, along with varying epithelial cell necrosis in areas of the kidneys. A more recent mouse bioassay of the effects of cylindrospermopsin revealed an increase in liver weight, with both lethal and non-lethal doses; in addition the livers appeared dark- coloured. Extensive necrosis of hepatocytes was visible in mice administered a lethal dose, and some localised damage was also observed in mice administered a non-lethal dose. =Toxicity= An initial estimate of the toxicity of CYN in 1985 was that an at 24 hours was 64¬±5 mg of freeze-dried culture/kg of mouse body weight on intraperitoneal injection. A further experiment in 1997 measured the LD50 as 52 mg/kg at 24 hours and 32 mg/kg at 7 days, however the data suggested that another toxic compound was present in the isolate of sonicated cells used; predictions made by Ohtani et al. about the 24‚Äëhour toxicity were considerably higher, and it was proposed that another metabolite was present to account for the relatively low 24‚Äëhour toxicity level measured. Because the most likely human route of uptake of CYN is ingestion, oral toxicity experiments were conducted on mice. The oral LD50 was found to be 4.4-6.9 mg CYN/kg, and in addition to some ulceration of the oesophageal gastric mucosa, symptoms were consistent with that of intraperitoneal dosing. Stomach contents included culture material, which indicated that these LD50 figures might be overestimated. =Mechanism of action= Pathological changes associated with CYN poisoning were reported to be in four distinct stages: inhibition of protein synthesis, proliferation of membranes, lipid accumulation within cells, and finally cell death. Examination of mice livers removed at autopsy showed that on intraperitoneal injection of CYN, after 16 hours ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) had detached, and at 24 hours, marked proliferation of the membrane systems of the smooth ER and Golgi apparatus had occurred. At 48 hours, small lipid droplets had accumulated in the cell bodies, and at 100 hours, hepatocytes in the hepatic lobules were destroyed beyond function. The process of protein synthesis inhibition has been shown to be irreversible, however is not conclusively the method of cytotoxicity of the compound. Froscio et al.. proposed that CYN has at least two separate modes of action: the previously reported protein synthesis inhibition, and an as-yet unclear method of causing cell death. It has been shown that cells can survive for long periods (up to 20 hours) with 90% inhibition of protein synthesis, and still maintain viability. Since CYN is cytotoxic within 16‚Äì18 hours it has been suggested that other mechanisms are the cause of cell death. Cytochrome P450 has been implicated in the toxicity of CYN, as blocking the action of P450 reduces the toxicity of CYN. It has been proposed that an activated P450-derived metabolite (or metabolites) of CYN is the main cause of toxicity. Shaw et al.. demonstrated that the toxin could be metabolised in vivo, resulting in bound metabolites in the liver tissue, and that damage was more prevalent in rat hepatocytes than other cell types. Due to the structure of CYN, which includes sulfate, guanidine and uracil groups, it has been suggested that CYN acts on DNA or RNA. Shaw et al.. reported covalent binding of CYN or its metabolites to DNA in mice, and DNA strand breakage has also been observed. Humpage et al. also supported this, and in addition postulated that CYN (or a metabolite) acts on either the spindle or centromeres during cell division, inducing loss of whole chromosomes. The uracil group of CYN has been identified as a pharmacophore of the toxin. In two experiments, the vinylic hydrogen atom on the uracil ring was replaced with a chlorine atom to form 5-chlorocylindrospermopsin, and the uracil group was truncated to a carboxylic acid, to form cylindrospermic acid (Figure 6). Both products were assessed as being non-toxic, even at 50 times the LD50 of CYN. In the previous determination of the structure of deoxycylindrospermopsin, a toxicity assessment of the compound was carried out. Mice injected intraperitoneally with four times the 5-day median lethal dose of CYN showed no toxic effects. As this compound was shown to be relatively abundant, it was concluded that this analogue was comparatively non-toxic. Given that both CYN and epiCYN are toxic, the hydroxyl group on the uracil bridge can be considered necessary for toxicity. As yet, the relative toxicities of CYN and epiCYN have not been compared. Figure 6. 5-Chlorocylindrospermopsin (left) and cylindrospermic acid, two non-toxic variants of CYN synthesised to demonstrate the importance of the intact uracil group as a pharmacophore. Related toxic blooms and their impact An algal bloom in a river near Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Since the Palm Island outbreak, several other species of cyanobacteria have been identified as producing CYN: Anabaena bergii, Anabaena lapponica , Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, Umezakia natans, Raphidiopsis curvata. and Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi. In Australia, three main toxic cyanobacteria exist: Anabaena circinalis, Microcystis species and C. raciborskii. Of these the latter, which produces CYN, has attracted considerable attention, not only due to the Palm Island outbreak, but also as the species is spreading to more temperate areas. Previously, the algae was classed as only tropical, however it has recently been discovered in temperate regions of Australia, Europe, North and South America, and also New Zealand. In August 1997, three cows and ten calves died from cylindrospermopsin poisoning on a farm in northwest Queensland. A nearby dam containing an algal bloom was tested, and C. raciborskii was identified. Analysis by HPLC/mass spectrometry revealed the presence of CYN in a sample of the biomass. An autopsy of one of the calves reported a swollen liver and gall bladder, along with haemorrhages of the heart and small intestine. Histological examination of the hepatic tissue was consistent with that reported in CYN-affected mice. This was the first report of C. raciborskii causing mortality in animals in Australia. The effect of a bloom of C. raciborskii on an aquaculture pond in Townsville, Australia was assessed in 1997. The pond contained Redclaw crayfish, along with a population of Lake Eacham Rainbowfish to control the excess food. Analysis revealed that the water contained both extracellular and intracellular CYN, and that the crayfish had accumulated this primarily in the liver but also in the muscle tissue. Examination of the gut contents revealed cyanobacterial cells, indicating that the crayfish had ingested intracellular toxin. An experiment using an extract of the bloom showed that it was also possible to uptake extracellular toxin directly into the tissues. Such bioaccumulation, particularly in the aquaculture industry, was of concern, especially when humans were the end users of the product. The impact of cyanobacterial blooms has been assessed in economic terms. In December 1991, the world's largest algal bloom occurred in Australia, where 1000 km of the Darling-Barwon River was affected. One million people-days of drinking water were lost, and the direct costs incurred totalled more than A$1.3 million. Moreover, 2000 site-days of recreation were also lost, and the economic cost was estimated at A$10 million, after taking into account indirectly affected industries such as tourism, accommodation and transport. =Current methods of analysis in water samples= Current methods include liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), mouse bioassay, protein synthesis inhibition assay, and reverse-phase HPLC-PDA (Photo Diode Array) analysis. A cell free protein synthesis assay has been developed which appears to be comparable to HPLC-MS.

The studio session tapes are kept at Abbey Road Studios, formerly known as \\"EMI Recording Studios,\\" where the Beatles recorded most of their music. While most have never been officially released, their outtakes and demos are seen by fans as collectables, and some of the recordings have appeared on countless bootlegs. Until 2013, the only outtakes and demos to be officially released were on The Beatles Anthology series and its tie-in singles, and bits of some previously unreleased studio recordings were used in The Beatles: Rock Band video game as ambient noise and to give songs studio- sounding beginnings and endings. In 2013, Apple Records released the album The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963, which includes previously unreleased outtakes and demos from 1963, to stop the recordings from falling into the public domain. Except where noted, all of the following songs are written by Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney and all single and album releases are for the United Kingdom. 1958 =Phillips' Sound Recording Services= In the spring or summer of 1958, The Quarrymen recorded two songs at Phillips' Sound Recording Services in their hometown of Liverpool. It was the group's first recording session, for which they paid 17s 6d (87.5p or ¬£ in ). The recordings were pressed onto a mono 10-inch 78 rpm shellac disc, then the sessions tapes were erased to be reused with new customers. Because of the low quality and age of the recordings, the songs are filled with a hiss but are still listenable. The record was not intended for release but for the Quarrymen's personal use. In 1981, Lowe sold the record to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney then had audio engineers attempt to improve the sound quality. ;RecordingsWinn, John C. (2003).

After recording the songs with Sheridan, the Beatles recorded two songs by themselves. Sutcliffe attended the session but did not play. The session tapes have since been destroyed, but some of the songs have been issued on numerous singles, EPs and albums, both official and unofficial. Information on the recording dates is sketchy, and much of the official documentation was lost in a fire. Sheridan later made more recordings with different backing musicians, resulting in some debate over which songs the Beatles are on. They are generally believed to appear on seven surviving tracks. The various mixes of the recordings have appeared on many compilation albums and other releases. Atlantic Records added extra instruments to two songs for a release in 1964. To complete their contract, The Beatles made more recordings in Hamburg on 24 May 1962. ;Recordings *\\"My Bonnie\\" ( Sheridan) (English intro) with Tony Sheridan Stereo mixed *Mono mixdown ‚Äì released on as a single on 5 January 1962 *Edited (intro removed) and stereo mixed (1964) Mono mixdown (1964) *Fake stereo mixed (1964) *Edited (spoken word by McCartney superimposed over the intro) and stereo mixed (1990s) ‚Äì released on Anthology 1 (2:42) *\\"My Bonnie\\" (German intro) with Tony Sheridan Stereo mixed *Mono mixdown ‚Äì released on as a single on 23 October 1961 (Germany) *\\"The Saints\\" (trad. arr.

They likely performed only one take of each song with no overdubbing. The Beatles did not pass the audition, but their manager, Brian Epstein, kept the reel-to-reel tapes to present to other record producers. Epstein arranged for the recordings to be pressed onto monoacetate discs, one of which was later heard by Parlophone producer George Martin, who offered them an audition which would turn out to be successful. The likely order of the songs was: ;RecordingsWinn, John C. (2003).

Only one song from this day has survived. The Beatles were accompanied by Roy Young, a pianist who had been playing with them at the Star-Club. Sheridan was not at the session, and he overdubbed his vocals on 7 June 1962 without the Beatles present. He re-recorded his vocals for \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" on 3 January 1964 to contain a reference to the Beatles' fame. Atlantic Records added extra instruments for a release in 1964. ;Recordings *\\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" (Bernie‚ÄìPinkard‚ÄìCasey, McCartney) Vocal overdub by Sheridan (7 June 1962) *Stereo mixed Mono mixdown Vocal overdub by Sheridan (3 January 1964) *Stereo mixed (1964) Mono mixdown (1964) *Extra instruments added and mono mixed (1964) Fake stereo mixed (1964) *\\"Swanee River\\" (Foster) ‚Äì lost ;Personnel Musicians: *Pete Best ‚Äì drums *George Harrison ‚Äì backing vocals, guitar *John Lennon ‚Äì backing vocals, rhythm guitar *Paul McCartney ‚Äì backing vocals, bass guitar *Roy Young ‚Äì piano Production staff: *Bert Kaempfert ‚Äì producer =EMI Artist Test= 6 June 1962 After the Decca audition recordings came to the attention of EMI managers through the efforts of the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, a recording contract was executed between Epstein and EMI's Parlophone record label. EMI would record a minimum of six single \\"sides\\" and the agreement would start on 6 June 1962, expiring a year later, but renewable. After the contract was signed, Parlophone record producer George Martin gave the Beatles an audition at EMI Studios in London, to assess their musical quality and respective vocal talents. The audition, held on 6 June, also acted as their first EMI recording session. They likely performed in Studio 2, the studio in which they would record most of their music. Because none of the recordings was considered worthy of release, the session tapes were destroyed per standard protocol; however, at least two mono recordings have since been discovered. Most documentation from the session has also been destroyed; however, it is known that four songs were recorded in an unknown amount of takes. Ken Townsend, who would become a regular at the Beatles' recording sessions, was on duty in the technical department that day. Martin was not satisfied with Best's drumming, so Epstein and the other Beatles soon dismissed him from the group. This session was Best's only recording session at EMI before he was replaced with Ringo Starr. ;Recordings 6‚Äì8 pm *\\"B√©same Mucho\\" (Vel√°zquez/Skylar) ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (from an unknown take) *Edited (1980s) ‚Äì released on Anthology 1 (2:37) *\\"Love Me Do\\" ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (from an unknown take) ‚Äì released on Anthology 1 (2:32) *\\"P.S.

Before the session, they rehearsed five songs, including \\"Please Please Me\\", in Studio 3 with Ron Richards, between 2.30‚Äì5.30 pm. They began work on Mitch Murray's \\"How Do You Do It\\", which Martin had chosen for them, but they disliked the song and wanted to release an original composition. They recorded at least two takes of \\"How Do You Do It\\" and at least 15 takes of \\"Love Me Do\\", then the best take of each song was mono mixed and pressed onto an acetate disc for Martin and Epstein to listen to. The session tapes were later destroyed, as was common practice until 1963. This session's version of \\"Love Me Do\\" was released as the Beatles' first single; however, it was later replaced with a version recorded seven days later, and the original was destroyed. When the original was later released on compilations, it had to be sourced from an original mono 45 rpm single. ;Recordings 7‚Äì10 pm *\\"How Do You Do It\\" (Murray) ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (from take 2) *Edited (1980s) ‚Äì released on Anthology 1 (1:57) *\\"Love Me Do\\" ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (from an unknown take) ‚Äì released as a single on 5 October 1962; included on Past Masters (2:25) and Mono Masters (2:25) ;Personnel Musicians: *George Harrison ‚Äì acoustic and lead guitar, backing vocals *John Lennon ‚Äì harmonica, rhythm guitar, vocals *Paul McCartney ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals *Ringo Starr ‚Äì drums Production staff: *George Martin ‚Äì producer *Norman Smith ‚Äì engineer 11 September 1962 Concerned with Ringo's drumming, the producers hired session drummer Andy White for another attempt at recording the Beatles' first single. In Studio 2, they recorded three songs with White drumming, while Ringo was relegated to maracas and tambourine. The best takes of \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" were mono mixed. An unknown amount of takes of \\"Please Please Me\\" were also recorded but none was used. The session tapes were later destroyed, thus there are no true stereo versions of the songs, although at least one mono recording has been discovered. Although the previous session's version of \\"Love Me Do\\" was originally released as the single, following the release of the EP The Beatles' Hits, it was replaced with the version from this session, and the original was destroyed. \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" were mixed in \\"fake stereo\\" on 25 February 1963 in the control room of Studio 1. Although they were originally released in fake stereo on the stereo version of Please Please Me, modern remastered stereo releases contain the two songs in mono, as fake stereo has fallen out of style. ;Recordings 10 am ‚Äì 1 pm *\\"P.S.

After the successful recording of \\"Please Please Me\\", Martin spoke the now-famous line, \\"You've just made your first number one.\\" In addition to the two sides of the single, they also performed an unknown number of takes of another original composition, \\"Tip of My Tongue\\", but Martin was unhappy with the arrangement. They never recorded it again and, instead, gave it to Tommy Quickly, another artist managed by Epstein. \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"Ask Me Why\\" were mono mixed at an unknown time on 30 November in Studio 2. An edit and stereo mix of \\"Please Please Me\\" and a new mono and a stereo mix of \\"Ask Me Why\\" were made on 25 February 1963 in Studio 1, for inclusion on the mono and stereo versions of the Please Please Me album. 26 November 1962 ;Recordings 7‚Äì10 pm *\\"Please Please Me\\" (takes 1‚Äì18) ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (from an unknown take) (30 November 1962) ‚Äì released as a single on 11 January 1963; included on Please Please Me (mono) (2:03) Edit of takes 16, 17 & 18 (25 February 1963) *Stereo mixed (25 February 1963) ‚Äì released on Please Please Me (stereo) (2:01) *\\"Ask Me Why\\" (takes 1‚Äì5) ‚Äì destroyed *\\"Ask Me Why\\" (take 6) ‚Äì destroyed Mono mixed (30 November 1962) ‚Äì released as the B-side to \\"Please Please Me\\" Mono mixed (25 February 1963) ‚Äì released on Please Please Me (mono) (2:28) Stereo mixed (25 February 1963) ‚Äì released on Please Please Me (stereo) (2:27) *\\"Tip of My Tongue\\" (unknown number of takes) ‚Äì destroyed ;Personnel Musicians: *George Harrison ‚Äì backing vocals, lead guitar *John Lennon ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals, harmonica *Paul McCartney ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals *Ringo Starr ‚Äì drums Production staff: *George Martin ‚Äì producer *Norman Smith ‚Äì engineer 30 November 1962 ;Personnel Production staff: *George Martin ‚Äì producer *Norman Smith ‚Äì engineer 1963 =Please Please Me album sessions= On 11 February in Studio 2, the Beatles recorded almost the entirety of their debut album, Please Please Me, between 10 am and 10.45 pm. They also recorded several takes of \\"Hold Me Tight\\". Although in 1963, the convention of destroying session tapes after the final mixes were made had mostly ceased, the session's takes of \\"Hold Me Tight\\" were destroyed, as the song was left unused until seven months later when they re- recorded it for their next album. On 20 February in Studio 1, Martin recorded overdubs for \\"Misery\\" and \\"Baby It's You\\". The album was edited and mixed on 25 February in Studio 1.

Bred at Darby Dan Farm near Lexington, Kentucky by his prominent owner, John W. Galbreath, Chateaugay was a son of Swaps, the 1956 U.S. Horse of the Year and a Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Racing career =1962: two-year-old season= Racing at age two for future U.S. Hall of Fame trainer James P. Conway, Chateaugay showed limited promise, winning two of five starts but without a victory in a stakes race. =1963: three-year-old season= Prep races At age three, the colt began to develop and after winning the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course was sent to compete in America's most prestigious race, the Kentucky Derby. Triple Crown races The 1963 edition of the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of the Triple Crown series, saw 120,000 patrons gather at Churchill Downs for a race that featured three Thoroughbred stars. TIME magazine reported jockey Eddie Arcaro as saying: \\"I can't remember a Derby creating so much excitement.\\" Leading up to the race, Rex C. Ellsworth's undefeated Candy Spots had won the Florida Derby and the Santa Anita Derby. At the same time, a Greentree Stable colt named No Robbery had won the Wood Memorial Stakes, and he too came into the Derby undefeated. Then there was Harry F. Guggenheim's 1962 U.S. 2-Year-Old Champion Colt and 1963 Flamingo Stakes winner, Never Bend. By post time, bettors had made Candy Spots the 3-2 favorite, No Robbery the second choice at 5-2, and Never Bend the third pick at odds of 3-1. Even though he came into the race undefeated at three (3-3) including a win in April's Blue Grass Stakes, Chateaugay was nearly ignored amid the hype surrounding the three star horses and was sent off at 9-1 odds. When the gate opened, Never Bend quickly took the lead and by the ¬º mile mark No Robbery had moved into second place along the inside rail with Candy Spots sitting third. After running in sixth place through the first three-quarters of a mile, coming out of the backstretch Chateaugay moved to the far outside and raced into fourth place behind the three leaders. As they turned for home, jockey Braulio Baeza spotted an opening between the second- and third-place horses. He raced through it to pull alongside Never Bend and then moved ahead to win the race by 1¬º lengths. In the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, Chateaugay again faced both Candy Spots and Never Bend. Five days before the race, he got away from his exercise rider and equalled Pimlico's track record, working a mile in 1:37 3/5. Bettors made Candy Spots the favorite. As they had in the Derby, Never Bend charged out to an early lead with Candy Spots sitting in third. Once again, Chateaugay was far back, running seventh in the eight-horse field. As they turned onto the homestretch Chateaugay made his move and soon caught and passed Never Bend, who had fallen behind the now front-running Candy Spots. This time, Chateaugay could not catch the leader and finished second, 3¬Ω lengths back. As a result of major renovations in progress at New York's Belmont Park, the 1963 Belmont Stakes was run at Aqueduct Racetrack. As he had been in the Derby and Preakness, Candy Spots was the betting favorite. Sent off at 9-2 odds, Chateaugay repeated his running style from the previous two Classics and was well back of the leaders. Once again, while other horses began to tire during the 1¬Ω mile race, in the stretch, Chateaugay passed Candy Spots and pulled away to win by a widening 2¬Ω lengths. Later races Chateaugay went on to capture the 1963 Jerome Handicap but finished third in the Dwyer and Travers Stakes. =Later career= He was raced at age four and five with limited success before being retired to stud duty at Darby Dan Farm. His progeny met with modest racing success with perhaps his best being the colt True Knight, who won several stakes races including the Jerome and Suburban Handicaps. Stud record In 1971, Chateaugay became the first Kentucky Derby winner to be sold to Japanese interests. From 1972 until his death in 1985, he stood at a breeding farm in Japan, where he sired the 1981 Champion juvenile colt, Hokuto Flag. Pedigree In popular culture *In Ken Grimwood's novel Replay, the main character is stuck in a time loop and makes his first bet (of which he already knows the outcome), on Chateaugay in the 1963 Kentucky Derby. *In the TV show Mad Men, Season 3 Episode 9, Roger Sterling throws a Kentucky Derby party for the 1963 edition of the race.

YALSA is a national association of librarians, library workers and advocates whose mission is to expand the capacity of libraries to better serve teens. YALSA administers several awards and sponsors an annual Young Adult Literature Symposium, Teen Read Week, the third week of each October, and Teen Tech Week, the second week of each March. YALSA currently has over 5,200 members. YALSA aims to expand and strengthen library services for teens through advocacy, research, professional development and events. History The organization that is now referred to as the Young Adult Library Services Association began on June 24, 1957 and was called the Young Adult Services Division following a reorganization of the American Library Association. This reorganization resulted in the Association of Young People's Librarians being split into the Children's Library Association and the Young Adult Services Division. A major responsibility of YASD was the evaluation and selection of materials for young adults, with the most active YASD committee being the book selection committee. YASD also advocated for library services for youth by sending delegates to both the 1960 and 1971 White House Conferences on Youth. By the 1970s YASD was growing stronger with its own office and staff and in 1979 it was given division representation on the ALA council. YASD's involvement in book selection also continued with genre specific book committees being formed in 1988. The name change to the Young Adult Services Association occurred in 1992, and brought greater notoriety to the organization, as well as a new image, logo and a new mission and vision statement. The re-branding of YASD as YALSA in the 1990s also brought with it an electronic and online presence, as well as new programs such as Teen Read Week. Additionally, YALSA began awarding the Printz and Alex Awards. YALSA has also been awarded the World Book Goal award twice by the ALA for its work serving young adults in public libraries. Starting in 1994 presidents of YALSA also began identifying themes that would reflect their terms of service, such as, \\"Youth Participation Revisited\\" and \\"Developing a National Leadership Agenda for Library Service to Young Adults. The official journal of YALSA is called Young Adult Library Services and it provides articles of current interest, book reviews, professional literature and serves as the official record of the organization.

He is best known for his doping scandal at the 1987 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Oberstdorf, West Germany in which he and his coach Jim Page approved a plan to give Lynch an illegal transfusion to increase his red blood cell count. Lynch would finish second in the 15 km individual event behind Norway's Torbj√∏rn L√∏kken, only to be stripped of his medal when he and Page confessed to the scandal. Lynch would serve a two-year suspension as a result. He is the only Nordic combined athlete to ever been stripped of a medal either in the Winter Olympics or in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. The United States would not win a Nordic combined medal at the Nordic skiing World Championships until Johnny Spillane's gold medal in the 7.5 km sprint event at Val di Fiemme in 2003. Despite his doping controversy Lynch competed in two Winter Olympics, earning his best finish of 13th at Sarajevo in 1984. He would also become only the second American to win anything at the Holmenkollen ski festival when he won the Nordic combined event in 1983, fifteen years after John Bower won the same event.

Geography The municipal area stretches along the valley of the Sirnitzbach creek, a tributary of the Gurk river, within the Gurktal Alps. In the northwest, Albeck borders on the state of Styria near Mt Eisenhut and Turracher H√∂he Pass. In the west, the road leads from Sirnitz to Reichenau via Hochrindl Pass. The upper Gurk valley and its sources, two small cirque lakes (Gurksee and Torersee), are a protected area since 1981. Albeck comprises the cadastral communities of Albeck proper, Gro√üreichenau, Sankt Leonhard, and Sirnitz. The main settlement is the village of Sirnitz. =Neighbouring municipalities= History Ruins of Alt-Albeck Castle Albeck is a settlement area since the 10th century, when the surrounding estates were held by the Counts of Friesach, ancestors of Saint Hemma of Gurk. In 1043 Hemma granted the Lordship of Albeck to the short-lived Benedictine nunnery of Gurk. When Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg had the abbey dissolved in 1072, he ceded the estates to the newly established Diocese of Gurk. Albeck Castle (present-day Alt-Abeck) was first mentioned in 1155. Located high above the narrow Gurk valley, it was the residence of the local landlords; one Dietrich of Albeck, a canon at Gurk Cathedral, was even appointed bishop by Archbishop Conrad III of Salzburg in 1179. When the line became extinct in 1194, protracted inheritance disputes arose with the Styrian counts of Peggau- Pfannberg. Nevertheless, from 1264 the area was again held by the Gurk bishops, represented by local ministeriales. In the late 17th century, Alt- Abeck was demolished and a new Baroque castle was erected on the road to Sirnitz.

Many of her features were designed to minimise environmental impact. Viking ADCC was ordered by Viking Line from the Astilleros de Sevilla shipyard in Spain on 29 January 2007. In June of the same year, the build contract of the vessel was sold to the Spanish investment bank Basalease SA, who would charter the vessel to Viking Line when completed. Construction of Viking ADCC began on 18 December 2007. The keel of the vessel was laid on 6 May 2008. Until 2013, the half-built hull remained at the shipyard with an uncertain future.Astilleros de Sevilla echa el cierre al √∫ltimo sue√±o de la autarqu√≠a franquista. El Mundo, 1 January 2012. In February, it was reported that the unfinished ship had been sold to another Spanish shipyard, Factorias Vulcano, which would complete the ship. After some minor work done on the vessel by Factor√≠as Vulcano personnel, the unfinished hull was launched on 29 May 2013 and in June towed to Factor√≠as Vulcano shipyard in Vigo. Recent photographs show that the hull of the vessel is almost finished but the superstructure is still missing large sections.Night Car/Passengers Ferries Available.

The first sea trials were made in October 2018 and when the work on the ship was resumed on 25 March 2019, after several months of inactivity, there was still estimated 42 working days of work left.Pymar aprueba el acuerdo para que Vulcano retome las obras el lunes.

Ostensibly derived from a Latin poem which J√≥n Halld√≥rsson, Bishop of Sk√°lholt, found in France, it became a prototype of the maiden king medieval Icelandic bridal- quest romances: it seems to have been the earliest of these, and was followed by many more.Marianne Kalinke, Bridal-Quest Romance in Medieval Iceland, Islandica 46 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990), pp. 98‚Äì107; Shaun F.

These include Nitida saga, which is thought to be a direct response to Kl√°ri saga.Paul Bibire, 'From Riddarasaga to Lygisaga: The Norse Response to Romance', in Les Sagas de Chevaliers (Riddaras√∂gur): Actes de la Ve Conf√©rence Internationale sur les Sagas Pr√©sent√©s par R√©gis Boyer (Toulon.

Content and themes  The protagonist of the story, Prince Kl√°rus of Saxony, is told of the fair princess Serena of France by his mentor, Perus. Smitten by the description, Kl√°rus asks leave to travel to France and ask the hand of Serena. Perus initially advises Kl√°rus to rethink his proposal, as Serena is prone tricks and deceits. Kl√°rus does not listen however, and travels to France with his troops. Kl√°rus presents himself to the king of France, and is welcomed as a guest of honor. After sending her maid down to examine Kl√°rus, Serena invites him and his troops to a feast in her tower, and he brings along sixty men. The feast is most marvelous, and Serena acts most lovingly towards her guests. However, as the evening passes she grows more and more tired of his manners and fixation on getting her hand in marriage. She offers him the blade of a jewel encrusted knife, but at the last moment as he is prone to accept it slices it downwards, so that it cuts his tunic and streaks his chest, and mocks him for the scums and barbarians he brought to her chamber. Humiliated, Kl√°rus returns to Saxony and threatens to execute Perus unless he helps him seek revenge on Serena. Perus reluctantly agrees, but insists that in order to do so he needs full control of the Saxon kingdom for three years. He is granted the power, and using the resources builds three grand tents, each more beautiful and decadent than the last. At the end of the third year Perus instructs Kl√°rus that they shall return to France, but that he must go disguised and under the name of Eskelvar√∞, king of Ethiopia, with the aim to ask for Serena's hand. Once Kl√°rus and Perus along with the royal troops arrive in France, they pitch the three grand tents. Serena sends her maid to ask who arrives with such grandeur and display of wealth and riches, and if the grand tents would be able to be sold or gifted to her. The maid returns saying it is Eskelvar√∞ of Ethiopia. Serena invites this king to a feast as before, and is adamant that she will have the grand tents. Eskelvar√∞ says that the tents are not for sale, except if she is willing to buy them with her affection. She agrees, and later the night Eskelvar√∞ arrives at her chambers. Serena offers Eskelvar√∞ a drink, and drinks from the same pitcher beforehand. Once Eskelvar√∞ takes his drink a deep sleep falls upon him: where Serena orders him to be dragged from the bed, flogged until bare, and left on the floor. Eskelvar√∞ returns to his men ashamed and humiliated the next morning. Serena however still longs for the richness and grandeur of the tents, and asks Eskelvar√∞ to a feast a few days later, which ends the same way with Eskelvar√∞ whipped and humiliated. At the third invitation Perus asks the maid not to offer Eskelvar√∞ the sleep medication, and the maid tells them that the drinks that Serena drinks and Eskelvar√∞ drinks are separated by a small compartment in the pitcher. Perus asks that the medication be thinned out so as not to awaken suspicion, but so that Eskelvar√∞ does not sleep as long or deep. This comes to pass, and mid-night Eskelvar√∞ wakes up on the floor, and joins Serena in her bed, sleeping with her. This leads to her submitting to him, and she agreeing to marry him and leaving France to join him. Serena sleeps, and awakes in an unfamiliar, poor looking tent next to an unknown man, revealed to be Perus in disguise. Perus claims that she had sold her virginity to him, and that he is the true Eskelvar√∞, a poor vagabond. For the next 12 months the two of them travel in depravity, him making sure that they only ever have enough food to feed one himself, and the scraps going to her plate. Eventually they arrive at a big city, where Perus claims he cannot enter for the city has an open warrant for his capture. He sends her in to the city to beg for coin. For three days she attempts to do so with no success, but eventually comes across a temple, where she sees Kl√°rus in his true person. Kl√°rus takes notice of her, and pities her, giving her plenty to drink and eat. She brings this back to Perus, who insults her and takes all for himself, sending her back to beg. This repeats for three days, until Kl√°rus invites her to his own chamber where he dresses her in fine clothing, gives her a feast to mend her sorrows. Serena is greeted by her maids, and Kl√°rus tells her of the deception. She accepts his plea of apology, and they go back to Saxony where they lived happily ever after. The epilogue goes on to explain the deception, that once they had wed in France Kl√°rus had traveled back to Saxony, but Perus and Serena were left as vagabonds to test the conviction and strength of Serena. Having shown that she is willing to follow her husband even through poverty and hardship knowing her true rank, she is rewarded her character and became the queen of Saxony, ruler and loyal wife. While a romance, the saga, at least in its early versions, also positions itself as an exemplum. In the words of Shaun F. D. Hughes, 'It is clear from the epilogue to Kl√°ri saga, that Bishop J√≥n is using the romance genre as an elaborate exemplum to promote his uncompromising views on the responsible behaviors of wives towards their husbands'.' Kl√°ri saga as an Indigenous Romance', in Romance and Love in Late Medieval and Early Modern Iceland, ed. by Kirsten Wolf and Johanna Denzin, Islandica 54 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Library, 2008), pp. 135-164, at p. 158, available at http://cip.cornell.edu/DPubS?service=UI&version;=1.0&verb;=Display&handle;=cul.isl/1242914143. This aspect of the saga was, however, less influential on its successors than its bridal-quest plot. The saga is noted for its Latinate style (traditionally attributed to the putative Latin original but, according to Hughes and Kalinke, more likely simply a mark of learned Icelandic prose-style) and for heavy linguistic influence from Low German.Shaun F.

In 1999 Marples moved to Doncaster Rovers for ¬£12,000, which remains a club record fee received for a Stocksbridge player. Marples impressed so much in his early weeks at the club that he attracted interest from Premier League clubs, with Rovers valuing him at more than ¬£200,000. However, Maples stayed with Rovers and he was part of Doncaster's glory days when they won the Football Conference playoffs and the Division 3 championship in successive seasons from 2003 to 2004. A notable fact is that Marples never scored in a League or Cup match for Doncaster in 170 appearances. He signed for Chester in the summer of 2006 on a free transfer and over the next two years would again fail to find the net in more than 50 first‚Äìteam appearances.

Career  Laid down as Peuple in covered basin no.3 at Brest Dockyard in October 1793, she was renamed as Vengeur after the Bataille du 13 prairial an 2 in honour of the Vengeur du Peuple by a decree passed by the National Convention. She was launched on 1 October 1803 and completed in February 1804. She was again renamed in March 1805, becoming Imp√©rial. During the War of the Third Coalition, Imp√©rial was the flagship of a squadron under the overall command of Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leiss√®gues which was part of a larger French force that sailed from Brest, France, on 13 December 1805 for what was planned as a 14-month cruise to attack British merchant shipping while avoiding combat with major Royal Navy forces.Clowes, p. 184.Gardner, p. 20. On 15 December 1805, the French force split into two squadrons which proceeded independently from one another. Aboard Imp√©rial, Leiss√®gues led his squadron across the Atlantic Ocean bound for the Caribbean. After encountering a storm off the Azores in late December 1805,Clowes, p. 189.James, Vol. IV, p. 198. Imp√©rial and most of the squadron arrived at French-held Santo Domingo on Hispaniola on 20 January 1806, where Leiss√®gues ordered the ships to be recaulked after their long and difficult transatlantic voyage. On the morning of 6 February 1806, a Royal Navy squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth arrived off Santo Domingo to attack Leiss√®gues‚Ä≤s force.Clowes, p. 189. Leiss√®gues was conducting business ashore when the British squadron was sighted, and the French force was delayed in getting underway while it awaited his return to Imp√©rial. Several of Leiss√®gues‚Ä≤s ships were not yet ready for sea,James, Vol. IV, p. 190. but once aboard Imp√©rial, Leiss√®gues ordered his ships to get underway and sail westward along the coast of Hispaniola toward Nizao. In the resulting Battle of San Domingo, the French squadron maintained close formation, and the five French ships of the line formed a line of battle with Imp√©rial second in line behind Alexandre and ahead of Diom√®de, Jupiter, and Brave. Duckworth ordered his squadron to concentrate fire on the three leading French ships of the line, and accordingly the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, the British 74-gun third-rate ship of the line , engaged Imp√©rial closely, while another 74-gun third rate, , opened fire on Imp√©rial and Diom√®de simultaneously.James, Vol. IV, p. 191. As the engagement at the head of the French line became confused, with ships of the two sides intermingled and smoke restricting visibility, Imp√©rial engaged and threatened to overwhelm Duckworth‚Ä≤s flagship, the 74-gun third rate , which was leading the British line, but Cochrane placed Northumberland in between Imp√©rial and Superb in an effort to protect Superb. Imp√©rial inflicted severe damage on Northumberland, with some of her shots passing through Northumberland and striking Superb.James, Vol. IV, p. 192. As the battle continued, Imp√©rial became increasingly isolated.Clowes, p. 191. The 98-gun second-rate ship of the line steered toward Imp√©rial, fired two broadsides into her, and then raked her. Atlas‚Ä≤s tiller then jammed and she was engaged by Diom√®de and the damaged Northumberland drifted out of the action, but the rest of the British squadron concentrated its fire on Imp√©rial. Imp√©rial‚Ä≤s mainmast and mizzenmast collapsed, most of her guns had been silenced, and she was losing her ability to maneuver, and Leiss√®gues ordered her to turn toward shore. Pursued by the 84-gun third-rate ship of the line , Imp√©rial ran hard aground parallel to the beach on a coral reef off the coast of Hispaniola between Nizao and Point Catalan, suffering severe hull damage and losing all of her masts.Clowes, p. 192.James, Vol. IV, p. 193. The similarly damaged Diom√®de ran aground nearby. As the British ships moved out of gunnery range, the crews of Imp√©rial and Diom√®de assembled on deck to abandon ship. Imp√©rial had suffered about 500 casualties.James, Vol. IV, pp. 196‚Äì197. Leiss√®gues ordered Diom√®de and Imp√©rial burned as soon as their crews had completed their abandonment of the ships,James, Vol. IV, p. 198. but before that order could be carried out, boat crews from the fifth-rate frigates and HMS Magicienne boarded them on 8 February 1806 and captured them without meeting any resistance.James, Vol. IV, p. 197. The British boarding party took six prisoners aboard Imp√©rial and then burned her wreck.James, Vol. IV, pp. 196‚Äì197.

Most magmas derived in subduction zones come from the mantle above the subducting plate when hydrous fluids are released from minerals that break down in the metamorphosed basalt, rise into the mantle, and initiate partial melting. However, Defant and Drummond recognized that when young oceanic crust (less than 25 million years old) is subducted, adakites are typically produced in the arc. They postulated that when young oceanic crust is subducted it is \\"warmer\\" (closer to the mid-ocean ridge where it formed) than crust that is typically subducted. The warmer crust enables melting of the metamorphosed subducted basalt rather than the mantle above. Experimental work by several researchers has verified the geochemical characteristics of \\"slab melts\\" and the contention that melts can form from young and therefore warmer crust in subduction zones. The geochemical characteristics Defant and Drummond gave for adakites are: *SiO2 greater than 56 wt % *Al2O3 greater than or equal to 15 wt % *MgO normally less than 3 wt % *Sr greater than 400 ppm *Y less than 18 ppm *Yb less than 1.9 ppm *87Sr/86Sr usually less than 0.7045 Later Defant and Kepezhinskas reviewed the topic in some detail pointing out that adakites are found associated with many mineral deposits including gold and copper. Drummond and Defant noted that Archean trondhjemites (which make up most of the ancient crust of continents) have similar geochemical characteristics to adakites. They suggested that the entire Archean crust may have been derived from the partial melting of subducted oceanic crust during the Archean (> 2.5 billion years ago) because during early earth the temperature of the mantle was much hotter and more oceanic crust was generated and subducted younger. The proposal has been controversial and is still being argued among the scientific community. The alternative interpretation is that the continental crust was derived from the partial melting of lower crustal basalts. The same idea has also been postulated for the generation of adakites. However, this hypothesis does not explain the correlation between subducted young crust and adakite eruptions nor the fact that the lower Yb and Y in adakites suggest that garnet is stable in the source. Garnet forms only under high pressures within the earth and would not be stable in lower crust below some island arcs that erupt adakites. See Martin et al. for a more recent summary. Low magnesium adakites may be representative of relatively pure partial melting of a subducting basalt, whereas high-magnesium adakite or high-magnesium andesites may represent melt contamination with the peridotites of the overlying mantle wedge. Adakites have also been reported from the continent- continent collision zone beneath Tibet and Lesser Caucasus.Chung, Sun-Lin, et al.

Clarke, first published in 1956 in Fantastic Universe. It appears in his collection of \\"science fiction tall tales,\\" Tales from the White Hart. The story deals with a computer programmer's revenge on his unreasonable military boss by tinkering with software code in a way that makes his boss the laughingstock of the organization. \\"The Pacifist\\" details the construction of a supercomputer within \\"a cavern in Kentucky\\" (Clarke may have been thinking of Mammoth Cave, then suspected (and later known) to be the world's longest known cave system). The purpose of the computer is military battle simulation, and the details of all known historical battles have been stored in the computer's data banks. The computer's designer, nicknamed \\"Dr. Milquetoast\\" by the story-within-a-story's narrator, works under the harsh supervision of a military General. By way of revenge, Dr. Milquetoast programs the computer so that it will answer purely theoretical or mathematical questions put to it, but when asked to solve a military problem, responds by insulting the General using phrases industriously prepared by the programmer. Frustration mounts as the General realizes that because the computer is aware of every known historical military battle, it is capable of recognizing such scenarios even when couched in purely mathematical terms. Analysis The story presents a computer programmer as an \\"everyman,\\" a downtrodden and unappreciated worker who has the last laugh on his tormentor. In 1956, computers were rare, and computer programmers were regarded as an engineering elite. Although the character of Dr. Milquetoast is depicted in a classic stereotypical fashion for his character's archetype, the frustration he feels, at the hands of the General, humanizes the character. Published near the beginning of the Cold War, \\"The Pacifist\\" satirizes the military-industrial complex (although the term would not come into wide use for another five years.) The involvement of civilian scientists in military projects was familiar to the reading public, notably the involvement of J. Robert Oppenheimer's team of nuclear scientists in the Manhattan Project, under the military leadership of General Leslie Groves. Legacy The story's theme of a military computer gone haywire has been used numerous times in written and filmed science fiction. Later examples include Dr. Strangelove (1964), Colossus: The Forbin Project (novel, 1966, film version, 1970), and WarGames (1983).  External links  * Category:Short stories by Arthur C.

Skartaris debuted in 1st Issue Special #8 (November 1975), where the character Travis Morgan, a U.S. Air Force pilot, discovers a passage into this world through the Earth's North Pole. Subsequent to that first issue, the Warlord series tells of Morgan's adventures in Skartaris. Publication history According to Mike Grell, creator of Skartaris and The Warlord, \\"the name comes from the mountain peak Scartaris that points the way to the passage to the earth‚Äôs core in Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\" While Grell never drew a map of Skartaris during his tenure on the book, one was created towards the end of the original volume's run, and the illustration appeared in The Warlord Annual #4 (1985). In an interview from Comic Scene in 1983, he says: \\"I did things like moving my character around the countryside; I never drew a map so I could move him from one side of Skartaris to the other just for the sake of the story.\\" In a later interview with Comic Book Resources Grell said, \\"Anything that can happen in fantasy happens in the lore and it‚Äôs one of the reasons I always refused to draw a map of Skartaris. Year after year after year went by, and I was always hounded by the editors, 'When are you going to have a map?' The reason I refused was because once you draw a map, you establish boundaries. And why would you want to put boundaries on your imagination?\\" History Skartaris is essentially a translation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Pellucidar into the graphic medium, with elements of Jules Verne and half a dozen other fictional Hollow Earth settings, and the admixture of magic and the Atlantis myth. In Grell's concept, as in Burroughs', the Earth is a hollow shell with Skartaris as the internal surface of that shell. Skartaris is accessible to the surface world via a polar opening allowing passage between the inner and outer worlds. There are also various tunnels connecting the interior world with the surface. Skartaris is lit by a miniature sun suspended at the center of the hollow sphere, so it is perpetually overhead wherever one is in Skartaris. The miniature sun never changes in brightness, and never sets; so with no night or seasonal progression, the natives have little concept of time. There is however, a \\"moon\\" that orbits the sun in a random way, resulting in certain areas of Skartaris being covered in darkness from time to time. The events of the series suggest that time is elastic, passing at different rates in different areas of Skartaris and varying even in single locales. Skartaris is populated by primitive people of various levels of culture ranging from the primitive to medieval, with the most advanced inhabiting city state monarchies such as Shamballah (based on the mythical Tibetan realm of Shambhala), the home of Morgan's principal love interest Tara. The practice of magic is well developed, numerous sorcerers being known, usually antagonistic to each other and to Morgan; the most prominent is Deimos, his main antagonist. Remnants of the super-scientific technology of Atlantis can also be found. Skartaris is overrun by a variety of prehistoric creatures from all geological eras, notably dinosaurs. Most early issues of the comic characterize the setting with the following tag phrase: \\"In the savage world of Skartaris, life is a constant struggle for survival. Here, beneath an unblinking orb of eternal sunlight, one simple law prevails: If you let down your guard for an instant you will soon be very dead.\\" Skartaris was eventually retconned into being located in another dimension instead of physically inside the Earth. Thousands of years ago, before it was colonized by humans, this dimension was known as \\"Wizard World\\" because of the number of magical beings that lived in it. =New Atlantis= Atlantean survivors of the city of Challa-Bel-Nalla, then ruled by Lord Daamon (an ancestor of Deimos), formed an alliance with an alien race they called the Red-Moon Gods. These aliens provided the Atlanteans with advanced technology that Travis Morgan would later discover in New Atlantis. New Atlantis first appears in The Warlord Annual #2 (1983). Lord Norrad the Younger, one of the Atlantean Knights of the Sea Eagle left Atlantis with a small group of followers and travelled to Skartaris. Yet another group led by the Atlantean sorcerer Ar-Diamphos escaped the sinking of Atlantis and found New Atlantis, Ar-Diamphos had Norrad killed and made himself ruler. He transformed them into beast men known as Blood Brothers using Red-Moon God technology. =Books of Magic= Skartaris is depicted in The Books of Magic #3, part of a four-issue mini-series written by Neil Gaiman. =Suicide Squad= Skartaris is featured in the Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag limited series, and is the source of a techno-mystical artifact used by series protagonist Rick Flag, and his nemesis Rustam. =Secret Six= It is the location for the fight between the two factions of the Secret Six. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, during the Convergence storyline, Skartaris appears deep within the planet Telos. Points of interest * Asravar * Ba'al Forest - This is where Travis Morgan crashed his plane when he first arrived in Skartaris. He also met his future wife, Tara, here. There is also a race of Lizardmen living in the Ba'al Forest who worshipped Travis' plane and he had to fight them in order to receive his travel gear. The Ba'al Forest is also where the Children of Ba'al live. * Balgar Bay * Bandakhar * Bantham * Baroth Mountains * Beast Tower * Bloodrock Mountains * Captain Hawk's Stronghold * Caves of the Cyclops * Citadel of Timgad - It was formerly the great city of the Sorcerer Kings. The Citadel of Timgad is now overrun by hobgoblins and filled with traps. It's the only one that has wells in the Desert of Doom which attracts travelers. * City of the Dead * Desert of Doom * Desert of Sorrows * Doomgate Temple * Dragon Sea * Drakmeer * Forest of Ebondar * Great Fire Mountain * Groniko * Haunted Mountains * Isle of Titans - An island that is home to the Skartarian Titans led by Queen Amarant. The Warlord has his first encounter with Shakira here. * Kaambuka * Kalibahs * Kasamaga Island * Kiro - This is the city where Machiste is the king of. It has a diverse population and a Thieves' Market. The Warlord and Mariah's first costumes were fashioned here. * Lake of Dreams * Mountains of the Sun * North Sea * Sea of Grel - A sea that borders Skartaris to the west. It contains ports such as Bal Shazar, Kiro, Bakwele and Kallistan. It also contains the Bay of Tears, Balgar Bay, and Captain Hawk's Stronghold. The Warlord met Ligia (a beautiful woman of the sea) who once saved his life when he was defending her.  Bal Shazar - A sprawling seaport city that is known for its slave auctions. When the Warlord was captured, this city was where he first met Machiste.  Bakwele - A teeming port where the Warlord, Machiste, and Mariah occasionally stop during their travels.  Bay of Tears - It's located in the Sea of Grel. Pirates and slave-traders tend to come into conflict with each other here.  Kallistan * Shaban D'aba * Shadow Forest * Shamballah - A great golden city that is filled with Atlantean technology. It's also the home of the Warlord's wife Tara and their son, Joshua, is Shamballah's rightful king. During the Warlord's first visit, Shamballah's computers malfunctioned and nearly killed everyone who lived there. * Shebal Gladiator Arena - An area next to the Bay of Tears where men are trained to fight each other. The Warlord fights Machiste in a death match. Rather than kill Machiste, the Warlord kills Shebal himself and organizes a gladiator army of his own. * Skyra - An airborne city that was maintained by a cyborg named Tragg. The Warlord, Machiste, and Mariah were brought there by Pteranodons where they were forced to kill the caretaker who had a taste for flesh. With Tragg dead, the city fell to the ground and was destroyed. * Swamplands - The Swamplands of Skartaris are filled with poisonous snakes and semi-aquatic dinosaurs. This was where the Warlord was hunted by a man named Stryker. * Temple Grimfang * Temple of the Sun * Terminator - A land of perpetual darkness where Skartaris meets Earth. Deimos built his castle here when the Mask of Life made him vulnerable to sunlight.  Castle Deimos - This was where Deimos' castle was located. * Thera - The first Skartarian city that the Warlord visited and where he first met Deimos who was a high priest there. Although Thera is civilized, they were looked down by the other cultures who use them for human sacrifice. The city was later sacked by The Warlord's army and Deimos was overthrown. * Tower of Fear - A gigantic spire filled with demons who appear and disappear at random to kill anyone who enters the tower. The Warlord and Machiste were forced to enter the Tower of Fear to retrieve the Mask of Life which they did, not knowing it would be used in resurrectinh Deimos. * Umber * Valley of the Lion * Valley of the Snowbeast - An in Skartaris that is always cloudy and constantly covered in snow. The Warlord met a kindly Yeti-like creature here. When Machiste accidentally killed it, it was revealed that the creature was actually a beautiful winged creature that was trapped in a fur-like cocoon. In other media Skartaris from the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Chaos at the Earth's Core\\". * Skartaris appeared in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Chaos at the Earth's Core\\". Green Lantern, Supergirl, Stargirl, and S.T.R.I.P.E. were summoned by The Warlord's daughter Jennifer against Deimos. Metallo and the Silver Banshee had provided his forces with energy weapons in exchange for capturing the Great Stone which is actually a large chunk of Kryptonite. With the Justice League's help, they defeated Deimos' forces, bringing peace to Skartaris. Afterwards, Green Lantern closed the portal to that world so no one can capture the Great Stone. * In the episode of Powerless titled \\"Win, Luthor, Draw\\", Wendy goes through a portal inside LexCorp and returns in warrior armor claiming she had been to Skartaris. * In the film Aquaman, Arthur and Mera descend into the Trenches pursued by the mutated Atlantean inhabitants that live there. Finally, at an incredible depth, they emerge in a subterranean world where dinosaurs have survived. Here they also discover the trident Arthur needs to claim kingship, and his mother Atlanna who has been trapped in this submerged world since she disappeared. Though unnamed, with its connection to ancient Atlanteans and surviving dinosaurs, this world within ours would seem to be Skartaris.

The township of Poochera was not surveyed until 1920, and its name is thought to be taken from the name of King Poojeri, a local aboriginal who died in 1917. A nearby hill is also named Poochera, possibly stemming from the same origin. The town had a school which opened in 1920, but closed its doors in 1976. Poochera is the centrepoint of a large agricultural area, the town itself being a strategic grain exchange point for the region's farmers, who specialise in cereal crops and sheep. The town is 53 km away from the Gawler Ranges, and is commonly used as a stop off by tourists, who have access to a hotel and caravan park. Poochera, however, is probably best noted for its nearby colonies of dinosaur ant (Nothomyrmecia macrops), a rare, primitive species of ant that has attracted entomologists and evolutionary biologists from around the world. Apart from the Poochera Hotel and Caravan Park, the town is served by a roadhouse where most general supplies can be purchased. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Poochera had a population of 59 people. Poochera is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Flinders and the local government area of the District Council of Streaky Bay.

Career Usually composing the music while others handled the lyrics, Silver wrote for half a century, starting with World War I‚Äìera songs such as 1918's \\"You Can't Blame the Girlies (They All Want to Marry a Soldier),\\" and continuing through the decades with such classics as 1921's \\"I'm Going South\\", 1925's \\"Chasing Shadows\\" and 1940's \\"How Did He Look?\\" Silver frequently teamed with lyricists Benny Davis, Al Sherman and Al Lewis. Between 1931 and 1934, during the last days of Vaudeville, Silver and several of his fellow hitmakers formed a sensational revue called \\"Songwriters on Parade\\", performing all across the Eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits. Silver's songs were covered by virtually every major vocalist of the day, among them Al Jolson, Ruth Etting, Jack Leonard, Mildred Bailey, Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, Helen Kane, Kate Smith, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Mel Torm√©, Eddie Fisher, Peggy Lee and Julie London. In a later era his songs were sung by Elvis Presley, Frankie Lymon, Etta Jones, Johnny Mathis, Brenda Lee and Dame Shirley Bassey. Numerous performers covered what became a country standard, \\"My Window Is Facing South,\\" including Willie Nelson, Vassar Clements, Commander Cody and Lyle Lovett. Among band leaders who performed tunes composed by Silver were Django Reinhardt, Louis Prima, Lionel Hampton and Les McCann. In the late 1950s he penned several numbers for Elvis Presley to perform in his movies, including the songs \\"Young and Beautiful,\\" \\"What's She Really Like?\\" and \\"Lover Doll.\\" Sung by Tom Jones, Silver's \\"With These Hands\\" (with lyrics by Benny Davis) was featured in the movie Edward Scissorhands, starring Johnny Depp. His early song \\"He's So Unusual\\" was covered by Cyndi Lauper on her breakout album, the similarly titled She's So Unusual.

In 1794, under Alain Joseph Dordelin, she took part in the Glorious First of June. Along with Indomptable, she helped rescue the Montagne trapped in the midst of the British fleet. Under Zacharie Jacques Th√©odore Allemand, Tyrannicide was part of Bruix's squadron from March 1799 and took part in the Cruise of Bruix. Tyrannicide was renamed Desaix in August 1800 in honour of General Louis Desaix. Under Captain Jean-Anne Christy de la Palli√®re, she captured the 14-gun brig , captained by Lord Cochrane, on 3 July 1801. Desaix took part in the First Battle of Algeciras in Algeciras Bay on the coast of Spain on 6 July 1801 as part of a French squadron under the command of Charles-Alexandre L√©on Durand Linois, who formed his squadron into line of battle with his ships 500 yards (460 meters) apart and his flagship, the 80-gun ship of the line Formidable, at the northern end, with Desaix behind her., p. 461. As the ships of the British squadron under the command of Rear Admiral James Saumarez entered the bay, they were becalmed, and Linois ordered his ship‚Ä≤s crews to warp their vessels into shallow water. Meanwhile, the British 74-gun third rate ship of the line under Captain Samuel Hood, opened fire on Desaix at long range at 08:50.Clowes, p. 462. At 09:15, Saumarez‚Ä≤s flagship, the 74-gun third rate ship of the line , anchored in the bay and joined the action, also firing on Desaix., p. 116. When a light breeze began to blow in from the northwest, Linois ordered his ships to sever their anchor cables and maneuver into better defensive positions close inshore, but Desaix ran aground directly in front of Algeciras during the maneuver.James, p. 117. Desaix was one of the more badly damaged of the French ships involved in the battle,Clowes, P. 465. which ended in a French victory.

De Novo sequencing and homology searching Molecular & Cellular Proteomics. 10.1074/mcp.O111.014902 (2011). and PTM Identification. PEAKS provides a complete sequence for each peptide, confidence scores on individual amino acid assignments, simple reporting for high-throughput analysis, amongst other information. The software has the ability to compare results of multiple search engines. PEAKS inChorus will cross check test results automatically with other protein ID search engines, like Sequest, OMSSA, X!Tandem and Mascot. This approach guards against false positive peptide assignments. PEAKS Q is an add-on tool for protein quantification, supporting label (ICAT, iTRAQ, SILAC, TMT, 018, etc.) and label free techniques. SPIDER is a sequence tag based search tool within PEAKS, which deals with the possible overlaps between the de novo sequencing errors and the homology mutations. It reconstructs the real peptide sequence by combining both the de novo sequence tag and the homolog, automatically and efficiently. 400 px A collection of algorithms used within the PEAKS software have been adapted and configured into a specialized project, PEAKS AB, which has proven to be the first method for automatic monoclonal antibody sequencing.

In the night of 30 December 1794, Nestor was dismasted due to the poor quality of her masts, and had to return to Brest for repairs. On her journey back, the Nestor met a British frigate flying a French flag. The British officers closed in, addressed their French counterparts in perfect French, and were told the position of the French fleet. In December 1796 Nestor took part in the Exp√©dition d'Irlande as flagship of Linois' squadron of three ships of the line and four frigates. After reaching Bantry Bay but deciding not to land troops on the advice of embarked French Army generals, the squadron headed back to Brest, taking three prizes on the way and sailing through the British blockade by night. Nestor was renamed Cisaplin in 1797 and Aquilon in 1803. By 1809, she was part of the French Atlantic Fleet. In April 1809, the French Atlantic Fleet was blockaded by the Royal Navy in Basque Roads at the mouth of the Charente on the Biscay coast of France. On 12 April, during the Battle of Basque Roads, Aquilon was aground on rocks at low tide in Basque Roads near Charenton when British Royal Navy warships attacked.James, William (2002) [1827]. The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808‚Äì1811. London: Conway Maritime Press. , p. 111. During the afternoon, the British brig-sloop took up a position across her bows and raked her with heavy carronades. After two hours of pounding by the British fleet with little chance to fire back, Aquilon surrendered.Clowes, William Laird (1997) [1900]. The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume V. London: Chatham Publishing. , p. 264. Although the leader of the British attack, Lord Thomas Cochrane, disapproved of the decision, the commanding officer of the third rate ship of the line , Captain John Bligh, deemed Aquilon beyond repair and set her afire during the night of 12-13 April 1809. The fire completed the destruction of Aquilon‚Ä≤s wreck.Cordingley, David (2007). Cochrane the Dauntless. London: Bloomsbury Publishing. , p. 200.

Because Tigre served in the Navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. After the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Tigre continued in the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Tigre shared the prize money with ten other British warships. Between 30 October and 1 November 1809 Admiral Benjamin Hallowell's squadron was at the Bay of Rosas. On 30 October, in the Battle of Maguelone, boats from Tigre joined with boats from Tuscan, , , , Topaz, , and in a cutting out attack after a squadron off the south of France chased an enemy convoy into the Bay of Rosas. The convoy had lost its escorting ships of the line, and , ran aground near Frontignan and scuttled by their crew, but were nevertheless heavily protected by an armed storeship of 18 guns, two bombards and a xebec. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties in the clash, but Tuscan had only one officer slightly wounded, and one seaman dangerously wounded. By the following morning the British had accounted for all eleven vessels in the bay, burning those they did not bring out. In January 1813 prize money was awarded to the British vessels that took part in the action for the capture of the ships of war Gromlire and Normande, and of the transports Dragon and Indien. A court declared a joint captor. Head money was also paid for Grondire and Normande and for the destruction of Lemproye and Victoire. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"1 Nov. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Fate She was eventually broken up in June 1817.

During the War of the Third Coalition, Diom√®de was part of a French force that sailed from Brest, France, on 13 December 1805 for what was planned as a 14-month cruise to attack British merchant shipping while avoiding combat with major Royal Navy forces.Clowes, p. 184.Gardner, p. 20. On 15 December 1805, the French force split into two squadrons which proceeded independently from one another. Diom√®de was part of the squadron under the overall command of Vice- Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leiss√®gues, which headed across the Atlantic Ocean bound for the Caribbean. During the voyage, Diom√®de suffered serious damage in a storm off the Azores in late December 1805.Clowes, p. 189.James, Vol. IV, p. 198. She arrived with most of the squadron at French-held Santo Domingo on Hispaniola on 20 January 1806, where Leiss√®gues ordered the ships to be recaulked after their long and difficult transatlantic voyage. On the morning of 6 February 1806, a Royal Navy squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth arrived off Santo Domingo to attack Leiss√®gues's force.Clowes, p. 189. Although several of Leiss√®gues's ships were not yet ready for sea,James, Vol. IV, p. 190. Leiss√®gues ordered them to get underway and sail westward along the coast of Hispaniola toward Nizao. In the resulting Battle of San Domingo, the French squadron maintained close formation, and the five French ships of the line formed a line of battle with Diom√®de third in line behind Alexandre and Imp√©rial and ahead of Jupiter and Brave. Duckworth ordered his squadron to concentrate fire on the three leading French ships of the line, and accordingly the British 74-gun third-rate ship of the line opened fire on Imp√©rial and Diom√®de simultaneously.James, Vol. IV, p. 191. As the engagement at the head of the French line became confused, with ships of the two sides intermingled and smoke restricting visibility, Diom√®de came across the 98-gun second-rate ship of the line and fired a heavy broadside into her, after which Atlas engaged her an close range.Clowes, p. 191.Gardner, p. 24. Spencer also resumed firing at Diom√®de. Imp√©rial turned toward shore and Diom√®de followed her, and late in the morning both ships ran aground parallel to the beach on a reef off the coast of Hispaniola between Nizao and Point Catalan, suffering severe hull damage and losing all of their masts.Clowes, p. 192.James, Vol. IV, p. 193. As the British ships moved out of gunnery range, the crews of Diom√®de and Imp√©rial assembled on deck to abandon ship. Diom√®de had suffered about 250 casualties.James, Vol. IV, pp. 196‚Äì197. Leiss√®gues ordered Diom√®de and Imp√©rial burned as soon as their crews had completed their abandonment of the ships,James, Vol. IV, p. 198. but before that order could be carried out, boat crews from the fifth-rate frigates and HMS Magicienne boarded them on 8 February 1806 and captured them without meeting any resistance.James, Vol. IV, p. 197.

Parking guidance and information (PGI) systems, or car park guidance systems, present drivers with dynamic information on parking within controlled areas. The systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing and variable message sign technologies to provide the service. Modern parking lots utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, car location when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience. This includes adaptive lighting sensors and parking space indicators (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), and indoor positioning systems (IPS). PGI systems are a product of the worldwide initiative for the development of intelligent transportation system in urban areas. PGI systems can assist in the development of safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation network. PGI systems are designed to aid in the search for vacant parking spaces by directing drivers to car parks where occupancy levels are low. The objective is to reduce search time, which in turn reduces congestion on the surrounding roads for other traffic with related benefits to air pollution with the ultimate aim of enhancement of the urban area.

From about 590 Alpine Slavs immigrated into the lower parts of the valley, followed by Bavarian settlers in the 10th century. In the High Middle Ages, when the area was part of the Duchy of Carinthia, the valley belonged to the estates of Millstatt Abbey. From about 1300 the Benedictine monks had large parts of the woodland cleared.

His or Her Majesty's Excise refers to 'inland' duties levied on articles at the time of their manufacture. Excise duty was first raised in England in 1643. Like HM Customs (a far older branch of the revenue services), the Excise was administered by a Board of Commissioners who were accountable to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. While 'HM Revenue of Excise' was a phrase used in early legislation to refer to this form of duty, the body tasked with its collection and general administration was usually known as the Excise Office. In 1849 the Board of Excise was merged with the Board of Stamps and Taxes to form a new department: the Inland Revenue. Sixty years later the Excise department was demerged from the Inland Revenue and amalgamated with HM Customs to form HM Customs and Excise (which was itself amalgamated with the Inland Revenue in 2005 to create HM Revenue and Customs). Organisation Wadsworth Brewery: office provided for the use of HM Customs and Excise, such as every brewery was obliged to provide up until 1994. Following the example of HM Customs, the Board of Excise set up a network of administrative areas called 'Collections'. Unlike HM Customs, the Excise operated inland as well as on the coast: initially it had 39 Collections in England (mostly corresponding with the English Counties) and 4 in Wales; later its remit was extended to cover Scotland and Ireland as well. Each Excise Collector was required to tour his Collection eight times a year, visiting each Market Town in turn in order to hold 'sittings' and receive revenue payments. In the intervening time, locally-based Excise Officers (known as gaugers) would make regular visits to the manufacturers and retailers in order to assess the duty payable on relevant items and to issue 'vouchers' summarizing the duty owed. This pattern of work remained the norm through the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1820s, an excise officer wrote a detailed description of his daily routine, spent visiting a series of different manufacturers and retailers: chandlers, brewers, innkeepers, tanners, maltsters, distillers and tea and tobacco merchants (with substantial amounts of administrative work to be done in the intervening moments). The excise officer carried various specialist items of equipment for testing and measuring different dutiable products; for example the Sikes hydrometer (invented by an officer of Excise, Benjamin Sikes, in the 18th century and used by Excise officers from 1816 until 1980 for measuring the alcohol proof of spirits). =Headquarters= Initially, in 1643, the Excise Office had a headquarters in Broad Street in the City of London. Thereafter, as it expanded, it leased successively larger properties in and around the City; the Office returned to Broad Street in the 1670s but moved out again in the early 1700s, only to return once more (to a new purpose-built headquarters) in 1769. The Excise remained there until 1852, when its staff moved to join the other departments of the newly-formed Inland Revenue in Somerset House. History The Resolution, an Excise Cutter (wearing the ensign and pennant of the Excise Board) in 1794. =17th century= On 22 July 1643, the Long Parliament passed the 'Excise Ordinance' (an Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of moneys by way of charge or impost upon several commodities) to raise money for the maintenance of Parliamentary forces. The ordinance established a board of eight Commissioners to oversee the collection of this revenue. Duty was initially levied on beer, cider, spirits and soap, but the list of dutiable items grew year by year and before long excise duty was being levied on such day-to-day necessities as meat, fish, clothes and leather, prompting public resentment. After the Restoration the Excise (which had begun as a temporary measure) was retained; duty was levied on beer, cider, spirits and the Coffee House beverages of tea, coffee and chocolate). From 1662 Excise revenue was farmed on and off (i.e. leased to speculators in return for an annual rent) until a Board Commissioners of Excise was established on a permanent footing in 1683. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, with the English Army expanding and fighting multiple campaigns, levels of duty were increased and new duties were raised: beer duty was doubled and over the next twenty-five years such diverse commodities as salt, glass, malt, candles, hops, leather, windows, wire, soap, paper and starch all became subject to excise duty. =18th century= The Excise was now seen as an efficient and effective means of raising revenue and Robert Walpole (as Chancellor of the Exchequer and de facto Prime Minister) sought to make the most of it. In 1725 a duty was placed on malt (causing outcry and opposition in Scotland). Seven years later he began to explore the possibility of using the Excise to counter problems of fraud and smuggling related to imported goods - particularly wine and tobacco - within the remit of HM Customs. When he presented his proposals to Parliament in 1733 it prompted a full-blown 'Excise Crisis': there was public frenzy, fuelled by fears that the Bill marked the first stage of a General Excise being imposed on all manner of domestic goods and other articles. When the Bill was withdrawn there were widespread celebrations. A 1790 Gillray cartoon: John-Bull, baited by the dogs of excise, depicting William Pitt urging on a pack of parliamentary hounds from the Excise Office.Details In the wake of the crisis no new Excise duties were introduced for the next fifty years (except for a relatively short-lived duty on household plate). When, however, William Pitt the Younger arrived as Prime Minister, he brought with him a determination to raise revenue more effectively by way of the Excise service. A duty on bricks was introduced in 1784. Then, in 1786, Pitt revisited the proposals embodied in Walpole's withdrawn Excise Bill of 1733: the intention had been to reduce customs duty on imported wine and tobacco to a nominal amount and instead impose an Excise duty; on arrival, the goods would be placed directly in a bonded warehouse where they would remain under Excise control. Despite opposition from affected merchants and retailers, the Bill was passed. The gamble paid off and within a few years the duty on tobacco had established itself as Britain's most productive form of revenue (and it remained so until 1968). Thereafter, the developing war with France had prompted the introduction of new forms of duty and further increases. In due course, the warehousing system proved advantageous to the traders since duty was only payable on the removal of goods from the warehouse. This enabled them to delay paying duty until the goods were sold (whereas previously Customs duty had to be paid the moment the goods arrived on dry land). In 1803 an Act was passed allowing the warehousing of all types of goods liable to Excise duty, and new warehouses were built in ports all round the country. Smuggling remained a problem with which both Excise and Customs officers were now having to engage. As part of their response, both services were provided with revenue cutters (sea-going vessels to help them patrol the nation's coastal waters). The Excise Board had a fleet of seven cutters in operation by 1784; HM Customs had twenty vessels of its own and two dozen more under contract. =19th century= Combined Customs, Excise and Stamp Office in Bradford, dating from 1899. During and after the Napoleonic Wars, the number and level of excise duties continued to grow . From the 1820s, however, this trend began to be reversed; by 1840 the number of duties levied had reduced from twenty-seven to ten. Salt duty was repealed first, in 1825, followed by the long-standing excise duties on beer and cider (levied since 1643). In 1830, Sir Henry Parnell published an influential treatise On Financial Reform, which argued for the repeal of duties on the raw materials for building and manufacturing (including those on bricks, tiles, leather and hemp) in order to encourage manufacturing, the repeal of duties on items otherwise involved in manufacturing processes (including those on coal, glass, candles and soap) and the reduction of excise duty on wine and tobacco (in order to discourage smuggling); in order to counterbalance these proposed reductions Parnell argued for the (re-)introduction of taxes on property and on income (i.e. direct, rather than indirect, taxes). The following year the duties on leather and on printed cotton were repealed, followed by that on candles. (The abolition of the latter was widely welcomed: chandlers' equipment was required to be kept secure behind a crown lock outside working hours, the key to which was held by the local excise officer, who was obliged during working hours to monitor the chandlers' work every four hours.) Furthermore responsibility for import duties was returned to HM Customs. Where excise duties remained in place (e.g. on spirits, malt, soap and paper) the requirement for officers to monitor the manufacturing process was reduced. Amalgamations New Wing, Somerset House: home of the Inland Revenue's Excise Department. During the 1840s the Excise Office contracted as further duties were repealed (e.g that on glass in 1845). Before long, plans were being drawn up to merge the much-reduced department with the Board of Stamps and Taxes (itself formed from a recent amalgamation). The merger was achieved after Parliament passed the Inland Revenue Board Act in January, 1849. The reduction in excise duties continued post-amalgamation, with duties being repealed on bricks (1850), soap (1853) and paper (1861). In 1880 malt duty followed suit, but it was replaced by a new excise duty on beer (which varied depending on the specific gravity of the product). In addition, the excise staff inherited responsibilities from other departments of the Revenue, such as railway passenger duty. In the early 20th century a decision was taken to unite the two Boards responsible for indirect taxation; the Board of Customs and Excise was formed in 1909, leaving the Inland Revenue to administer direct taxes (principally income tax, which had been re-introduced in 1842).

He participated in the Mongol invasion of Russia and Europe in 1236-1242.Leo de Hartog (2004). Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World. Tauris Parke Paperbacks. , p.165 The clan of Borolday is not clear. He was probably from one of four tribes that Chinggis Khaan (1162‚Äì1227) assigned to his eldest son, Jochi: the Sanchi'ud (or Salji'ud), Keniges, Uushin, and Je'ured clans.  Career  Serving under Jochi's successor and son, Batu Khan, Borolday's vanguard surprised and crushed the great army of Yuri II, the Grand Prince of Vladimir, at the battle of the Sit River in 1238. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev in 1240. After the conquest of Rus, the Mongols invaded Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe. His name appears as Bujgai or Bujakh in The Secret History of the Mongols. According to The Secret History of the Mongols, √ñgedei, Khagan of the Mongol Empire, praised Subutai and Bujgai's merit when he blamed his son G√ºy√ºk's arrogant behaviour. Borolday assisted Subutai to prepare the strategy of the final assault during the Battle of Mohi (1241). Borolday's division directly attacked the main camp of King B√©la IV of Hungary. Batu's brother Shiban's vanguard supported this attack. After a very hard fight, Batu's army crushed the Hungarians and their allies, Croats and Templar Knights at Mohi on April 11, 1241. During the succession struggle over the throne of the Mongol Empire in early 1251, 100,000 Jochid troops under Borolday were stationed near Otrar to keep an eye on the Chagatayids who allied with the √ñgedeids against Batu's cousin and ally, M√∂ngke. In 1255, Daniel of Galicia revolted against the Mongol rule. He repelled the initial Mongol assault under Orda's son Quremsa. Berke replaced Quremsa, son of his eldest brother, Orda, with the much experienced Borolday. The latter led a force that overcame the resistance of Danylo of Halych in 1259. According to some sources, Daniel fled to Poland leaving his son and brother at the mercy of the Mongol army. He may have hidden in the castle of Galicia instead. The Mongols needed to halt Poland's aid to Daniel as well as war booty to feed the demand of their soldiers. Boroldai forced him to demolish all walls of cities in Galich and Volhynia.Michael B. Zdan \\"The Dependence of Halych-Volyn' Rus' on the Golden Horde\\", The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 35, No. 85 (Jun., 1957), p. 516 The Mongols knew that the Lithuanians had raided Mongol vassals, Smolensk and Torzhok, in the previous year.http://krotov.info/acts/12/pvl/novg07.htm Alongside Nogai Khan, Boroldai led a punitive expedition against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Mongols attacked Lithuania, but the Lithuanians fled before the decisive battle. After pillaging several villages and towns in Lithuania, Borolday returned to Galich and demanded Daniel assist him in his battle against the Poles. The Rus soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Lublin, Sandomierz, Zawichost, Krak√≥w, and Bytom were ravaged and plundered by the Mongol army. Berke had no intention of occupying or conquering Poland. After this raid Pope Alexander IV tried without success to organize a crusade against the Tatars. After 1259, Boroldai's name does not appear again in Russian annals. A general named Burulday was killed in the battle at the Terek River on January 13, 1263, during the Berke‚ÄìHulagu war. This may have been Boroldai. His name appears in the opera The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and in Mongolian fairy tales.

The constant (C) and variable (V) domains are shown. An antibody molecule. The two heavy chains are colored red and blue and the two light chains green and yellow. See also: The immunoglobulin light chain is the small polypeptide subunit of an antibody (immunoglobulin). A typical antibody is composed of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains and two Ig light chains. In humans There are two types of light chain in humans: * kappa (Œ∫) chain, encoded by the immunoglobulin kappa locus (IGK@) on chromosome 2 * lambda (Œª) chain, encoded by the immunoglobulin lambda locus (IGL@) on chromosome 22 Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes, each expressing only one class of light chain. Once set, light chain class remains fixed for the life of the B lymphocyte. In a healthy individual, the total kappa-to-lambda ratio is roughly 2:1 in serum (measuring intact whole antibodies) or 1:1.5 if measuring free light chains, with a highly divergent ratio indicative of neoplasm. The exact normal ratio of kappa to lambda, according to a novel polyclonal free light chain assay, ranges from 0.26 to 1.65. Both the kappa and the lambda chains can increase proportionately, maintaining a normal ratio. This is usually indicative of something other than a blood cell dyscrasia, such as kidney disease. In other animals The immunoglobulin light chain genes in tetrapods can be classified into three distinct groups: kappa (Œ∫), lambda (Œª), and sigma (œÉ). The divergence of the Œ∫, Œª, and œÉ isotypes preceded the radiation of tetrapods. The œÉ isotype was lost after the evolution of the amphibian lineage and before the emergence of the reptilian lineage. Other types of light chains can be found in lower vertebrates, such as the Ig-Light-Iota chain of Chondrichthyes and Teleostei.IMGT Index Antibodies (or Immunoglobulins). Camelids are unique among mammals as they also have fully functional antibodies which have two heavy chains, but lack the light chains usually paired with each heavy chain. Sharks also possess, as part of their adaptive immune systems, a functional heavy-chain homodimeric antibody-like molecule referred to as IgNAR (immunoglobulin new antigen receptor). IgNAR is believed to have never had an associated light chain, contrary to the understanding that the heavy-chain- only antibodies in camelids may have lost its light chain partner through evolution. Structure Only one type of light chain is present in a typical antibody, thus the two light chains of an individual antibody are identical. Each light chain is composed of two tandem immunoglobulin domains: * one constant (CL) domain * one variable domain (VL) that is important for binding antigen The approximate length of a light chain protein is from 211 to 217 amino acids. The constant region determines what class (kappa or lambda) the light chain is. The lambda class has 4 subtypes (\\\\lambda1, \\\\lambda2, \\\\lambda3, and \\\\lambda7). In pathology Individual B-cells in lymphoid tissue possess either kappa or lambda light chains, but never both together. Specific rearrangement of lambda light chain of immunoglobulins can lead to loss of some protein coding genes, which does not seem to be functionally relevant (while functionally relevant miR-650 can be overexpressed). Using immunohistochemistry, it is possible to determine the relative abundance of B-cells expressing kappa and lambda light chains. If the lymph node or similar tissue is reactive, or otherwise benign, it should possess a mixture of kappa positive and lambda positive cells. If, however, one type of light chain is significantly more common than the other, the cells are likely all derived from a small clonal population, which may indicate a malignant condition, such as B-cell lymphoma. Ig light chains produced in neoplastic plasma cells, such as in multiple myeloma, are called Bence Jones proteins. Increased levels of free Ig light chains have also been detected in various inflammatory diseases. It is important to note that, in contrast to increased levels in lymphoma patients, these Ig light chains are polyclonal. Recent studies have shown that these Ig light chains can bind to mast cells and, using their ability to bind antigen, facilitate activation of these mast cells (Redegeld (2002)). Activation of mast cells results in the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators which are believed to contribute to the development of the inflammatory disease. Recent studies have shown that Ig light chains not only activate mast cells but also dorsal root ganglia (Rijnierse, 2009) and neutrophils (Braber and Thio (2012)), expanding their possible role as mediators in inflammatory disease.

Born in Bex in the Canton of Vaud, Eyer studied in Lausanne, Geneva and Neuch√¢tel and taught sport disciplines in Vevey. In 1894, Eyer and nine other Swiss pedagogues, including Georges de Regibus and Charles Champaud, were invited to Bulgaria by the Minister of Education Georgi Zhivkov to lay the foundations of sports education in the country. Eyer taught physical education in Lom (1894), Silistra (1903) and Rousse (1909) and was the main coach of the Yunak sports associations around the country. He introduced the sports of track-and-field, boxing, weightlifting, wrestling to Bulgarian physical education. \\"Pro Bulgaria\\" When the Balkan Wars broke out, Eyer, despite being a foreign citizen, regarded the protection of his second homeland as his duty and enlisted in the Bulgarian Army as a volunteer. He was a commander of a company of the Macedonian- Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps' 12th Lozengrad Battalion. For his valour, he was twice awarded a Cross for Honour and was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant. Following Bulgaria's defeat in the Second Balkan War, he published the French-language book Pro Bulgaria (\\"For Bulgaria\\") in 1913, defending the Bulgarian position.Pro Bulgaria at Open Library After Bulgaria joined World War I, Eyer again enlisted as a volunteer as an officer in the 38th Infantry Regiment. He died on 2 September 1916 during the Battle of Doiran, and was buried in the village of ƒåau≈°li, today in North Macedonia.

History  Boggs was writing in the 1970s about revolutionary movements in Russia, Italy, Spain, and the US New Left.

Building Popular Power: Workers' and Neighborhood Movements in the Portuguese Revolution. New York: Monthly Review Press. The politics of prefiguration rejected the centrism and vanguardism of many of the groups and political parties of the 1960s. It is both a politics of creation, and one of breaking with hierarchy. Breines wrote: \\"The term prefigurative politics [...] may be recognized in counter institutions, demonstrations and the attempt to embody personal and anti-hierarchical values in politics. Participatory democracy was central to prefigurative politics. [...] The crux of prefigurative politics imposed substantial tasks, the central one being to create and sustain within the live practice of the movement, relationships and political forms that \\"prefigured\\" and embodied the desired society.\\"Breines, Wini. Community and Organization in the New Left, 1962‚Äì1968: The Great Refusal, 1989, p. 6. Anarchists around the turn of the twentieth century clearly embraced the principle that means used to achieve any end must be consistent with that end, though they apparently did not use the term \\"prefiguration\\". For example, James Guillaume, a comrade of Mikhail Bakunin, wrote, \\"How could one want an equalitarian and free society to issue from authoritarian organisation? It is impossible.\\"quoted by Benjamin Franks in The direct action ethic: From 59 upwards. Anarchist Studies 11, No. 1, 22; Cf. Benjamin Franks, 2008.

They envisaged creating a public space in the middle of American cities, for political dialogue and achieved some of the attributes of community in providing free food, libraries, medical care, and a place to sleep.Andy Cornell, Consensus: What It Is, What It Is Not, Where It Came From, and Where It Must Go.

According to German Federal Electoral Law, members of a parliamentary group which share the same basic political aims must not compete with one another in any federal state.\\"Federal Electoral Law\\". German Law Archive. Retrieved 18 December 2016. The CSU contests elections only in Bavaria, while the CDU operates in the other 15 states of Germany. The CSU also reflects the particular concerns of the largely rural, Catholic south.\\"Christian Democrat Union/Christian Social Union\\". Country Studies, Germany. Retrieved 18 December 2016. While the two Christian Democratic parties are commonly described as sister parties and have been sharing a common parliamentary group in the Bundestag, the CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group in the German Bundestag () since the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, the parties themselves officially remain completely independent with their own leadership and only few issue- or age- based joint organisations, which makes the alliance informal. However, in practice the committees of the parties harmonise their decisions with each other and the leader of one party is usually invited to party conventions of the other party. Both the CDU and CSU are members of the European People's Party and the International Democrat Union. Both parties sit in the European People's Party group in the European Parliament. The CDU and CSU share a common youth organisation, the Youth Union, a common pupil organisation, the , a common student organisation, the Association of Christian Democratic Students and a common Mittelstand organisation, the .  History  Both the CDU and the CSU were established after World War II and share a perspective based on Christian democracy and conservatism and hold the dominant centre- right position in the German political spectrum. The CSU is usually considered the de facto successor of the Weimar Republic‚Äìera Bavarian People's Party (BVP), which itself broke away from the all-German Catholic Centre Party (DZP) after World War I, but the CSU included also parts of the agrarian and liberal Bavarian Peasants' League and parts of the bavarian wing of the DVP. However the CDU's foundation was the result of a major re-organisation of the centre- right political camp compared to the Weimar Republic. Although the CDU was largely built as the de facto successor of the Centre Party, it successfully opened out to non-Catholic Christians (many of them affiliated with the German People's Party until 1933) and successfully asserted itself as the only major conservative party (outside of Bavaria) against initial competition from other Catholic, Protestant or national conservative parties such as the German Party during the early years of the Federal Republic. The BVP become sister party of the DZP and they did not compete against each other except for the May 1924 German federal election, the 1924 Bavarian state election and the 1925 German presidential election. The DZP and BVP were mostly jointly represented at the Imperial governments. For a short time, there existed the as sister party of the CSU during the 1957 West German federal election, the German Social Union (DSU) as sister party of the CSU before the 1990 East German general election, the East German CDU as sister party of the CDU until the German reunification and the until 1947. Alliance for Germany was a coalition for the 1990 East German general election consisting of the CDU, the DSU and Democratic Awakening which merged into the CDU.  Political stances  The CDU and the CSU usually only differ slightly in their political stances. The CSU is usually considered a bit more socially conservative (especially on family issues, e.g. the CSU favors providing infants' parents with compensation (Betreuungsgeld) if they intend not to use the public day nursery system to work while the CDU favors public funding of day nurseries). The CSU government in Bavaria has implemented one of the strictest regulations for shopping hours in Germany in order to protect employees. The CSU also strongly opposed ideas of an income unrelated system of contributions to public health insurances, a proposal which met a lot of approval in the CDU in 2010. CSU politicians often make their mark as self-declared defenders of Bavaria's state rights and cultural independence from federal or European Union bureaucrats, even in times of conservative federal governments or conservative presidents of the European Commission. In 1998, then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the CDU had to pressure the CSU intensely not to veto the introduction of the euro as the new currency in Germany. On the other hand, the name euro was the idea of former CSU chairman Theo Waigel, who served as finance minister when the euro was introduced and held a very pro-European position in contrast to the Bavarian government of Edmund Stoiber. Since 2016, the CSU has strongly been advocating the idea of a maximum number (Obergrenze) of 200,000 people per year to limit the number of asylum seekers. This is opposed by the CDU because they claim that it is impossible to limit the number through border control. While both parties officially identify themselves as non-denominational Christian, the Catholic influence on the CSU is far stronger than that on the CDU since Bavaria is predominantly Catholic while Christians in Germany as a whole are approximately equally balanced between Catholics and Protestants. There are nevertheless strong regional differences within Bavaria and Germany as a whole with large predominantly Protestant areas in northern Bavaria and large predominantly Catholic areas in North Rhine-Westphalia and South Western Germany having a strong effect on CDU state politicians. Saarland's former CDU Minister-President Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer heavily opposed same-sex marriages in July 2017 while the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein was in favor, with Saarland having the largest share of Catholic Christians in any German state.  Tensions  The differences between the CDU and the somewhat more socially conservative CSU have sometimes led to conflicts in the past. These tensions climaxed during the 1970s when Helmut Kohl became CDU chairman in 1973, then considered a moderate or even progressive politician and also a personal foe of the right-wing then-CSU chairman Franz Josef Strauss, who had held that office since 1961. = Brief 1976 separation = After the CDU/CSU narrowly lost the 1976 West German federal election which had seen Kohl as the common chancellor candidate of the two parties, the CSU's future Bundestag representatives met on 19 November at a closed meeting at Wildbad Kreuth in a Hanns Seidel Foundation compound which is the CSU's educational foundation. With a 30‚Äì18 vote, one abstention and one invalid vote, the CSU deputies decided to separate from their common faction with the CDU deputies in the Bundestag. The decision had been initiated by the CSU chairman Strauss, then himself a Bundestag deputy. The official reasons were to create a more effective opposition (the CDU would approach moderate conservatives while the CSU would approach the right) and gain more speaking time in parliament. As a party chairman, Strauss also announced that in addition the CSU as a party would terminate its self-restriction to Bavaria and foster the foundation of local CSU associations outside of the party's home state, running in all future German federal and state elections against the CDU on a distinctly more conservative platform than the CDU's. Strauss coined the term Vierte Partei (\\"fourth party\\") after the CDU, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). This term was technically misleading since the CSU had always been a distinct party from the CDU, therefore four parties had already been represented during previous Bundestag terms. During the conflict, the Aktionsgemeinschaft Vierte Partei, the Bund Freies Deutschland (West-Berlin), the Christlich Soziale W√§hler Union (Saarland), the Deutsche Union (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the Partei Freier B√ºrger (Bremen) were founded. On 12 December 1976, the vote was rescinded after the CDU had threatened in turn to form local associations within Bavaria and to run in Bavarian elections against the CSU. = 2018 refugee dispute = In 2018, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a former Minister-President of Bavaria and the leader of the CSU, opposed CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy on Syrian refugees in Germany. Seehofer hoped to place restrictions on incoming refugees, many of whom enter the country through Bavaria. His stance was seen as being in part motivated by the 2018 Bavarian state election in which it was feared that the far-right Alternative for Germany would make gains.

Chiarello was also one of the last two surviving Italian and Alpine Front veterans of the First World War, along with fellow 110-year-old Delfino Borroni. Called up in 1918, he enlisted in the Castrovillari. He spent three months in training and then served as an infantryman at Cosenza. First sent to the front line in Trentino, he was later sent by sea from the port of Taranto to Albania. There he contracted malaria, but recovered in a field hospital. Afterwards he was sent to Montenegro where he served for two more years in the Italian army. He later married and ran his farm in Umbriatico, but in 1940 he was called up again to fight in the Second World War at Reggio Calabria, to be discharged after six months. He lived in Cir√≤ Marina until his death in June 2008.

It is also worn by Navy personnel (mostly corpsmen, chaplains, Seabees, and their bodyguards) assigned to Marine Corps units (e.g. the Fleet Marine Force). It replaces the Battle Dress Uniform, which the Marine Corps had shared with the Navy, Army and Air Force. However, both the MCCUU, and its distinctive camouflage pattern, MARPAT, are exclusive to the Marine Corps, which holds the patents to their design, and are not available to the civilian market. The uniform is available in two color schemes, woodland and desert. The uniforms are manufactured by Propper International Inc., American Apparel, Inc., E.A. Industries, American Power Source Inc., Ready One Industries, Coachys And Associates LLC, and Columbia Sewing Company. The MCCUU should not be confused with the similar looking FROG uniform. Development Two U.S. Marines test out early predecessors to the MCCUU in 2001. The two prototypes feature removable sleeves, a feature that was later abandoned on the finished production version. Field testing of the MCCUU began in early 2001 and was officially announced to the public in June 2001. Early prototypes had featured removable sleeves, but that design feature was later abandoned. The patent for the MARPAT pattern was filed on June 19, 2001, whereas the patent for the MCCUU uniform was filed on November 7, 2001. The uniform made its official debut at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina on January 17, 2002, and the changeover was completed on October 1, 2004 (with a few exceptions of April 1, 2005),https://www.marines.mil/News/Messages/Messages- Display/Article/894296/mandatory-possession-dates-for-the-marine-corps-combat- utility-uniforms-mccuu-a/ a year ahead of the original deadline date set in 2001 of October 1, 2005. The early prototypes of the MCCUU were designed by Propper International and American Power Source. Design features The collar of an MCCUU, being worn by a U.S. Marine sergeant in 2002 The rear of an MCCUU, being worn by a U.S. Marine in 2002 The MCCUU is intended for wear in the field or for working parties, but has become the typical working uniform for all deployed and most garrison U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy sailors.ALMAR 035/07 directing wear of the MCCUU Initially the variety worn depended on the environment and season: Deployed Marines wore whichever color is more appropriate to the climate and terrain, Marines in garrison wore the woodland MCCUU in winter months, and the desert MCCUU in summer months. However, the Marine Corps announced on December 8, 2016 that the desert pattern would no longer be worn in garrison. Instead, the woodland MCCUU will be worn year-round, with the sleeves rolled up during the summer and down during the winter. Until recently, the sleeves of the blouse were normally worn rolled up while in garrison during summer months. However, the Uniform Board announced that as of October 24, 2011, this will no longer be allowed. This decision was later reversed when Marine Corps Commandant General James Amos announced on February 25, 2014, that the Marine Corps will return to its former standard of rolling up the sleeves while in garrison during summer months, effective March 9, 2014. Unlike the previous BDU, the MCCUU was designed to be used with body armor, which previously restricted access to front pockets. To further distinguish the uniform, upon close examination, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor can be found within the pattern. Its use as a combat uniform has led to some strict regulations for wear in garrison: unlike the U.S. Army's ACU, the MCCUU may not be worn off base, although it may be worn when commuting to and from duty in a privately-owned vehicle. Dismounting for incidental stops en route off of a military installation is no longer permissible excepting legitimate emergencies only. =Blouse= * Two slanting chest pockets with velcro closure * Two shoulder sleeve pockets with button closure * Reinforced elbows * Internal pockets for elbow pads * Adjustable cuffs * Eagle, Globe, and Anchor embroidered on the left chest pocket =Trousers= * Two front slash style pockets * Two rear pockets with button closure * Two thigh level bellows cargo pockets with elastic closure * Button fly * Reinforced knees and seat * Partially elastic waistband * Internal pockets for kneepads * Seven belt loops The trousers are worn bloused over the tops of the boots with the use of elastic bands (nicknamed \\"boot bands\\") or metal springs. =Headwear= * In garrison the 8 point cover is worn * In the field, the boonie (floppy) cover can be worn, not authorized for garrison wear. * The Marine Corps Lightweight Helmet and MICH is worn in combat and training with a reversible MARPAT cover * The Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor is embroidered on both the boonie and utility covers. =T-shirt= An olive drab green t-shirt, or skivvy shirt, without a logo is worn underneath the blouse.Marine Corps Uniform Board Due to the intense heat in Iraq, moisture wicking t-shirts, such as those produced by Under Armour became very popular. However, due to concerns that the shirts would melt to the skin in the event of a fire or explosion, they are banned when a Marine is deployed to a combat zone.Defense Tech: Marines Ban Under Armour However, the Marine Corps has worked with Danskin to develop their own moisture wicking shirts under the \\"Elite Issue\\" line, ultimately creating and issuing the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear to troops likely to be exposed to combat. =Belt= The MCCUU is worn with a webbed rigger's belt earned through the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. The belts are tan, grey, green, brown, or up to six degrees of black, depending on the Marine's proficiency. Uniform regulations still authorize a web belt for wear for Marines that have not qualified in MCMAP; however, the Commandant of the Marine Corps directed in 2008 that all Marines will qualify. This directive rendered the wear of the item on the MCCUU to new recruits in basic training or to those who have lost their MCMAP belt due to not being proficient in the MCMAP.ALMAR 034/07 directing all Marines to earn at least a tan belt by CY 2008 =Boots= The Marine Corps now requires tan rough-out combat boots, either hot weather or temperate weather versions. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation other than they must be at least 8 inches in height and bear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor on the outer heel of each boot. Stains and damage to the boot make them unserviceable for wear, as well as a heel with excessive wear. When the MCCUU was first being fielded in 2002, the black leather boots that were worn with the woodland BDU were authorized to be worn with the woodland MCCUU in the absence of the tan suede ones, though now, only the latter are authorized. =Insignia= Rank insignia is pinned onto the collar: * Marines from pay-grades E-1 to E-9 wear black insignia. * Marine officers wear polished insignia in garrison, subdued (flat black and brown to replace silver and gold, respectively) or none in the field. Most badges and breast insignia are authorized for wear on the utility uniform, shined or subdued as appropriate. Landing Support Marines also wear the Red Patch insignia.

The PIC serves as an educational centre and resource for providing Amsterdam's visitors with information and advice about prostitution. The practice of prostitution in the Netherlands was legalised nationally in October 2000.I amsterdam ‚Äì Prostitution, http://www.iamsterdam.com/introducing/government_politics/policies/prostitution . However, Amsterdam has long had a tolerant attitude towards prostitution, coupled with clear regulations that have been in force for many decades. Though prostitution is legal in Amsterdam, there is still a considerable amount of misunderstanding about it.Kathryn Lemmon, Learning About the Business at Amsterdam‚Äôs Prostitution Information Centre, http://www.gonomad.com/features/0105/lemmon_prostitution.html. The PIC's objective is to clear up some of that misunderstanding by providing visitors with accurate information regarding prostitution. The red light district in Amsterdam Founder: Mariska Majoor The PIC was founded in August 1994 by former prostitute Mariska Majoor. Majoor worked as prostitute from the age of 16 to 21, and quit, in her words, ‚Äúbecause I feel different now about sex and relationships than a couple of years ago‚Ä¶but there are plenty of people, who like me, have made a well considered choice to work in prostitution, and they deserve our respect.‚Äù She founded the PIC to inform the uneducated about prostitution. The PIC's purpose is to offer a freely accessible place where people who have questions about prostitution can get answers to almost any prostitution-related question, or can be referred to other knowledgeable organizations if necessary. Majoor strongly believes that prostitution is a profession that all countries should legalise.Allow Women to Sell Their Bodies to Earn a Living, Monitor (Uganda), Apr. 24, 2006. She has said, ‚ÄúEvery country should legalise prostitution; it‚Äôs part of society. In our eyes it‚Äôs a profession, a way of making money; it‚Äôs important that we are realistic about this. Most people think legalising is approval but it can be a way to deal with it, to organise it and make it safer. Prostitution is not bad; it‚Äôs only bad if done against one‚Äôs will. Most women make this decision themselves.‚Äù Visitor information Today the PIC is run by Majoor and other former prostitutes, and provides information to around 22,000 visitors a year. Visitors to the PIC can also find books about the red light district and sex works written in both Dutch and English. The PIC conducts lectures and slide presentations on prostitution and other sex-work related issues. Staff members of the PIC will also take interested visitors on a walking tour of the red light district. Groups can book a one-hour tour at the PIC whose experts will walk visitors through the neighborhood, explaining in detail how things work.Walking Amsterdam‚Äôs Red Light District, http://www.pic- amsterdam.com/tourgb.html . In addition for visitors‚Äô viewing, the PIC has a small room in the back that is a replica of a working prostitute's room. The tiny room contains a twin bed and porcelain sink, designed to give curious visitors an accurate picture of what the rooms behind the windows in the red light district are really like.  Wallenwinkel (Red Light District Store)  The PIC operates as a charitable foundation. It receives no government subsidies and has only survived over the years with great difficulty. However, the objectives of the PIC have been proven to be of importance to sex workers, their clients, Amsterdam residents, and visitors to the area alike. Without any financial support the PIC was struggling to operate, but clearly the PIC played a valuable role and needed to find a way to survive. So in January 2004, the PIC's activities merged with those of De Wallenwinkel, or the Red Light District Store. The Wallenwinkel, located next to the PIC, now operates as the PIC shop and provides the main source of financial support for the Prostitution Information Centre.Red Light District Store, http://www.pic- amsterdam.com/wallenwinkelgb.html . The Wallenwinkel specialises in unique red light district souvenirs and other articles related to Amsterdam's famous district. Many of the handmade gifts at the Wallenwinkel cannot be found anywhere else in the area and thus make great souvenirs for Amsterdam's travelers.

Geography The municipality lies in the west of Hermagor at the transition of the upper Gail Valley into the Lesachtal, between the Gailtal and Carnic Alps. It is located at an important road junction: in the north, the highway leads up to Gailberg Saddle and the market town of Oberdrauburg, in the south to Pl√∂cken Pass on the Carinthian border with the Carnian region of Friuli, Italy. =Municipality arrangement= K√∂tschach-Mauthen is divided into the four municipalities K√∂tschach (Koƒçe), Mauthen (Muta), Strajach (Srejah), and W√ºrmlach (Bumlje).

History The area in the Gail Valley was already settled around 200 BC. A Venetian rock inscription from this time still exists today in W√ºrmlach. A Roman road ran over Pl√∂cken Pass and led to the Noricum province, where a mansio named Loncium stood above present-day Mauthen (derived from German: Maut, \\"toll\\"). In the Middle Ages the remote region within the Duchy of Carinthia experienced economic growth due to the exploitation of iron ore, gold, silver and lead. Most of today's towns were already mentioned in the Middle Ages: Mauthen 1276, H√∂fling 1300, K√∂tschach 1308, Podlanig 1374, W√ºrmlach 1374 and St. Jakob 1376. In the 16th century followed Laas 1510, Mandorf 1521, and Gentschach 1590. From 1319, Mauthen was the seat of a regional court. In the 15th century the area was held by the Counts of Ortenburg, who had a furnace erected, succeeded by several ironworks. During World War I, the mountain crest of the Carnic Alps in the south was part of the Italian Front. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Carinthian Plebiscite the town received market rights in 1930. K√∂tschach and Mauthen were merged into the municipality of K√∂tschach-Mauthen in 1958. In a 1973 administrative reform, extensive areas in the upper Gail Valley and in the lower Lesachtal area were added to the municipality.

Wood processing, the production of heat exchangers, tourism in general and gastronomy in particular are important economic factors of the region. K√∂tschach-Mauthen is well known as a wellness and climatic spa. The town boasts a modern outdoor and indoor swimming pool (\\"Aquarena\\"), which is the biggest in both Upper Gailtal and Lesachtal. The National Hospital in nearby Laas consists of a medical department as well as a department for chronic patients.

Portrayed by Wayne Northrop, the character is introduced in the series' 1981 pilot episode as the chauffeur of oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Michael is also having an affair with Blake's self-indulgent daughter, Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin). Northrup left the series at the end of the first season, but returned for season seven, during which Michael dates Fallon's sister, Amanda (Karen Cellini). In The CW's 2017 reboot of the series, Michael is portrayed by Robert Christopher Riley. Appearances Northrop debuted as Michael in the Dynasty pilot episode, \\"Oil\\" (1981), and left in the season one finale, \\"The Testimony\\" (1981). He returned in the seventh season premiere \\"The Victory\\" (1986), and left again in the episode \\"The Sublet\\" (1987). Riley began playing Michael in the 2017 pilot of the Dynasty reboot. Original series =Storylines= Season one As Dynasty begins, Carrington chauffeur Michael is involved in a sexual relationship with heiress Fallon, the daughter of his boss, Blake Carrington. Michael proves useful to Blake in his shady business dealings, but Blake has him beaten up when he learns of his relationship with Fallon. Season two Fired by Blake, Michael leaves town in the episode \\"The Verdict\\" without informing Fallon of his departure. Season seven Michael returns in the seventh season premiere \\"The Victory\\", in time to save Fallon's sister Amanda Carrington from a fire at La Mirage. The two become romantically involved as Blake gives Michael back his job as Blake's driver, but Blake fires Michael when he sees him kissing Amanda. An angry Michael, not really as poor as he has let on, secretly orchestrates a deal that would give him a piece of Blake's latest venture. However, Amanda's mother Alexis Colby reveals his schemes, and he leaves Denver again in \\"The Sublet\\". Reboot =Casting and development= A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and Riley was cast as Michael in February 2017. The new series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. The character is one of several cast as nonwhite for the reboot. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said that with Michael and Carrington butler Anders, \\"we introduce the theme of upstairs/downstairs, because how can you have a show about the filthy rich without including the people who try their damnedest to keep them clean?\\" =Storylines= Season one Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley) is also Fallon's lover and unofficial henchman, though he has feelings for her which seem unrequited. Michael gets photos for Fallon of Cristal kissing her ex-lover Matthew Blaisdel in \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\". In \\"Guilt is for Insecure People\\", Michael is hesitant to help Fallon find leverage against her father Blake. Meanwhile, Fallon's brother Steven is suspicious of Blake's involvement in Matthew's death, and Michael reveals to him that Blake has Matthew's phone in his possession. Somewhat frustrated by Fallon's dismissive treatment, Michael becomes involved with Kori Rucks, Fallon's acquaintance from high school, in \\"Private as a Circus\\". Their relationship survives Fallon's jealous meddling in \\"I Exist Only for Me\\". In \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\", Fallon meets Michael's parents, Louella and James. Michael has led them to believe that he is a vice president at Carrington Atlantic, and Fallon backs him up. In \\"The Best Things in Life\\", Michael's relationship with Kori implodes over his lingering feelings for Fallon. In \\"Rotten Things\\", Fallon has a falling out with Monica Colby, who begins her own romantic relationship with Michael. When Fallon discovers that Monica is helping Jeff manipulate her into marriage for nefarious reasons in \\"Nothing But Trouble\\", Michael agrees to help Fallon investigate why, and turn the tables on the Colbys. In \\"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\\", Michael enlists the help of his computer genius teenage sister, Evie (Elizabeth Youman), who confirms Fallon's suspicions that Jeff has access to all Carrington emails and texts. On the eve of her faux wedding to Jeff in \\"Our Turn Now\\", Fallon tells Michael she loves him, and asks him to marry her at city hall. He refuses, not wanting something so important to be part of a Carrington plot. In \\"Enter Alexis\\", Michael learns that his father is seriously ill, and resigns. Cristal connects James's leukemia diagnosis to a Carrington Atlantic coverup in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\". Louella asks Fallon to keep her distance from Michael in \\"Use or Be Used\\". In \\"A Line from the Past\\", James dies as the coverup is exposed in the press, and Cristal‚Äîin her last act as COO after being fired by Blake‚Äîhires Michael. When Blake pushes back against Fallon's and Michael's efforts toward change in \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Michael urges Fallon to do the right thing. She finds incriminating information on Blake, which she uses in a secret meeting with the Carrington Atlantic board to make a case for them to name her CEO in Blake's place. Fallon professes her love for Michael in \\"Dead Scratch\\", but he announces his intention to leave Atlanta. When the Carringtons are trapped in the burning trophy room, Michael comes to their rescue. Season two In \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", Michael and Fallon have resumed their relationship. Though Fallon and Liam Ridley are still pretending to be married, Michael proposes, and she accepts.

Habitat Pinnularia is a predominantly fresh-water alga, usually found in ponds and moist soil. They can also be found in springs, estuaries, sediments, and oceans. Members of this genus are most commonly found in of water, at . External structure Pinnularia diatom shell Pinnularia are elongated elliptical unicellular organisms. Their cell walls are composed chiefly of pectic substances on a rigid silica framework. Their walls are composed of two halves called thecae (or less formally, valves.) These halves overlap like a Petri dish and its cover. The margins of the two thecae are covered by a connecting band called a cingulum and all together are referred to as a frustule. the surface view is called valve view and band view is called girdle view. The outer larger valve is called Epitheca and the smaller inner valve is called hypotheca. The cell is covered by a mucilaginous layer. Internal structure The cytoplasm is arranged approximately in layers conforming to the shape of the cell's walls. A large central vacuole is present with the nucleus suspended in its centre by a transverse cytoplasmic bridge. Two chloroplasts are present along the sides of the cells, and contain chlorophyll a, c, beta-carotene and fucoxanthin pigments. One or two pyrenoids are usually present in each chloroplast, although like many heterokont algae Pinularia tend to store their energy as fat. The cytoplasm also contains chrysolaminarin and some volutin. Reproduction Pinnularia diatom during reproduction (cell division) Pinnularia like most diatoms, can reproduce by simple cell division. Nuclear division occurs by mitosis and cell divides into two parts. Each daughter receives one of the parent cell's thecae, which becomes that cell's epitheca. The cell then synthesizes a new hypotheca. Thus one daughter is the same size as the parent, and one is slightly smaller. With subsequent generations the average cell size of a Pinnularia population gradually becomes smaller. When a minimum average size is reached auxospore formation occurs and sexual reproduction restores the population's average cell size.

It comprises the western part of the eponymous valley formed by the upper Gail River, and stretches from the Carinthian border with East Tyrol down to K√∂tschach-Mauthen in the east. Geography Sankt Lorenzen The Lesach Valley is located in the southwest of Carinthia. In adjacent East Tyrol, the uppermost continuation of the Gail river course is called Tilliach Valley. The lower eastern third of the Lesach Valley around the village of Sankt Jakob is part of the neighbouring K√∂tschach-Mauthen municipality. The narrow valley borders the Lienz Dolomites range of the Gailtal Alps to the north and the Carnic Alps up to high Mt. Hohe Warte () to the south, forming the border with Italy. Most settlements and paths are on the northern slopes over above the Gail River gorge. The municipality of Lesachtal (area 19.62 km¬≤, pop. 1,665) comprises the cadastral communities of Kornat, Liesing, Maria Luggau, and Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal. =Neighbouring municipalities= =Language= The language spoken in the Lesachtal valley is linguistically remarkable, because the Southern Bavarian dialect is not Carinthian, but rather East- Tyrolean with slight variations. Slovenian elements have also survived in local common speech.  History  Our Lady of Snows pilgrimage church, Maria Luggau The Lesach Valley (derived from Slavic: Les, \\"forest\\") was inhabited by Slavs about 600 AD. In the 8th century it was one of the first valleys in the Principality of Carantania to be Germanised after Prince Boruth had acknowledged the overlordship of Duke Odilo of Bavaria about 740. In 1380, the Lesach circuit (Landgericht Lesach) was transferred to the lordship of Pittersberg, named after a nearby rock castle, then an administrative seat held by the East Tyrolean Meinhardiner Counts of Gorizia. After their branch died out in the male line, the last countess Margaret bequeathed the lordship to the reigning princes of the House of Habsburg in 1363. Later it fell to the Carinthian Counts of Ortenburg. With the creation of the Austrian municipalities (Ortsgemeinden) in 1850, the three municipalities Luggau, Sankt Lorenzen, and Liesing were constituted. The cadastral communities (Katastralgemeinden) Kornach and Strajach merged with the municipality of Mauthen, but in 1182 obtained independent status as the municipality of Unterlesach. Ten years later the two localities Birnbaum and Sankt Jakob became independent municipalities as well. Through Carinthian local government reform in 1973, the eastern Lesach municipality of Sankt Jakob merged with K√∂tschach-Mauthen, while the four western municipalities were merged into the present municipality of Lesachtal. During World War I the Italian front between the Austro-Hungarian Army and the Royal Italian Army was located on the ridge of the Carnic Alps. Many old positions and fortifications bear witness to the attritional mountain war from 1915 to 1918. Population According to the 2001 census, the municipality of Lesachtal has 1,560 inhabitants, of which 98.4% are Austrian citizens and 1.3% are German citizens. The size of the population has been declining sharply in recent decades.

History Union League of Philadelphia The Union League of Philadelphia is the oldest and most prominent of the remaining loyalty leagues. Founded in 1862 as a patriotic society to support the Union and the policies of President Abraham Lincoln, it laid the philosophical foundation of other Union Leagues across a nation torn by Civil War. It has given loyal support to the American military in all conflicts since. Its motto is \\"Love of Country Leads.\\" The only condition of membership at its founding was ‚Äúunqualified loyalty to the government of the United States, and unwavering support of its efforts for the suppression of the Rebellion,‚Äù but its primary task was activist: ‚Äúto discountenance and rebuke by moral and social influences all disloyalty to the Federal government . . .‚Äù see philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/union-league-of-philadelphia/ As in 1862, its members prize tradition and represent the Philadelphia region's elite in business, education, religion as well as the arts and culture. Although no longer exclusively Republican or male in membership, The Union League of Philadelphia has maintained its identity as distinctly traditional and politically conservative. The club has hosted U.S. presidents, heads of state, industrialists, entertainers and visiting dignitaries from around the world. The club's building, a classic Second Empire-style structure with a brick and brownstone fa√ßade and dramatic twin circular staircases leading to the main entrance on Broad Street, was designed by John Fraser and completed in May 1865 [the opening was originally scheduled for March 1865, with President Lincoln in attendance, but was delayed due to wartime construction supply shortages]. In 1905, Philadelphia architect (and Union League member) Horace Trumbauer won a design competition to build major additions to the building. The Beaux Arts-style additions, completed in 1910 and 1911, expanded the length of the building to a city block. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Adorning the walls and hallways is the club's collection of art and artifacts, a chronicle of Philadelphia's imprint upon the American landscape. The Sir John Templeton Heritage Center was added to provide a permanent place to store and display the extensive collection of Civil War-related documents and objects. While much of the historical content is located at the Heritage Center, the club does maintain a large library for members with more than 26,000 volumes. Members can check out books or read them in the library at their leisure. Also inside the club are three restaurants for members to enjoy; Caf√© Meredith, Founders and 1862 by Martin Hamann, each with a distinct cuisine. The club has a charitable organization: The Union League Legacy Foundation which using the history and ethos of the League for educational programs for League members and the general public. Heritage Center In 2011, the Foundations of the Union League‚Äîthree non-profit charitable organizations founded by the membership of the Union League‚Äîcompleted construction on The Heritage Center, which includes a multi-purpose space for events, a museum space for exhibitions and a research center. The Center houses the historic collections of the Union League of Philadelphia, the Abraham Lincoln Foundation of Philadelphia, the two-dimensional collections of the Civil War Museum of Philadelphia, and the collections of both the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) and the Dames of the Loyal Legion (DOLLUS). The collections are all available for research. The three non-profit charities of the Union League merged in 2019 to become The Union League Legacy Foundation. The Legacy Foundation's mission is to inspire and educate League members, students, and the greater community to be engaged and responsible citizens, guided by the United States Constitution and the history and values of the Union League. The Legacy Foundation is a public charity which serves their mission through caring and sharing the historic collections, civics education for high school students, college scholarships and more. The Heritage Center (home of the Legacy Foundation) features an annually rotating exhibition to interpret and share stories of Union League and Philadelphia history. There are regular public open hours - Tuesdays and Thursdays 3pm to 6pm and the second Saturday of every month 1pm to 4pm, except when a new exhibition is being installed. Every February, weather permitting, there is an Open House, with docent-led tours of the entire League House, and special collections on display. For more information, visit www.ullegacy.org.

The novel is usually considered to be Asturias's masterpiece, yet remains one of the least understood novels produced by Asturias.Callan, p. 53 The title Hombres de ma√≠z refers to the Mayan Peoples' belief that their flesh was made of corn.Callan, p. 54 Its title originates in the Popol Vuh, one of the sacred books of the Maya. The English translation is part of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.Men of Maize. UNESCO. Themes The novel is written in six parts, each exploring the contrast of traditional indigenous customs and a progressive, modernizing society. Asturias's book explores the magical world of indigenous communities, a subject which the author was both passionate and knowledgeable of. The novel draws on traditional legend, but the story is of Asturias's own creation. The plot revolves around an isolated Indian community (the men of maize or \\"people of corn\\") whose land is under threat by outsiders, with the intent of commercial exploitation. An indigenous leader, Gaspar Ilom, leads the community's resistance to the planters, who kill him in the hope of thwarting the rebellion. Beyond the grave Ilom lives on as a \\"folk-hero\\"; despite his efforts, the people still lose their land. In the second half of the novel, the central character is a postman, Nicho, and the story revolves around his search for his lost wife. In the course of his quest he abandons his duties, tied as they are to \\"white society\\", and transforms himself into a coyote, which represents his guardian spirit. This transformation is yet another reference to Mayan culture; the belief of nahualism, or a man's ability to assume the shape of his guardian animal, is one of the many essential aspects to understanding the hidden meanings in the novel.Callan, p. 58 Through allegory, Asturias shows how European imperialism dominates and transforms native traditions in the Americas. By the novel's end, as Jean Franco notes, \\"the magic world of Indian legend has been lost\\"; but it concludes on a \\"Utopian note,\\" as the people become ants to transport the maize they have harvested. Written in the form of a myth, the novel is experimental, ambitious, and difficult to follow. For instance, its \\"time scheme is a mythic time in which many thousands of years may be compressed and seen as a single moment\\", and the book's language is also \\"structured so as to be analogous to Indian languages\\". Because of its unusual approach, it was some time before the novel was accepted by critics and the public. Plot introduction The novel deals with the conflict between two types of men: the ones who consider maize to be a sacred food (the indigenous people of Guatemala); and those who view it simply as a commercial product. It exposes the devastating effects capitalism and international companies had on the lives of Guatemalan maize growers, having a profound effect on their customs, ancestral beliefs and cultural identity. The novel is generally considered to be part of the literary genre known as Magic Realism. As such, it delves into the richness of native culture and oral tradition and touches themes such as: myths and legends, songs, native wisdom and lore, nahualism, magic and animal spirits.

Fagan was awarded the Australian Police Medal in 2004 and died in office, having committed suicide by hanging while on vacation. Early years and background Fagan was born in Ireland in 1962. Fagan and her parents, Arthur and Jenny, emigrated to South Australia in 1971, when Fagan was nine. She joined the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in 1981, at the age of 18. Death On 20 April 2007, Fagan committed suicide while holidaying on Queensland's Hayman Island. She was found hanged. The Queensland Police investigated her death and concluded there were no suspicious circumstances. Assistant Commissioner Fagan was under scrutiny over the treatment of detainees in Canberra police cells after the ACT Ombudsman revealed details in February of a joint review to examine procedures in Canberra's watch house. It followed complaints made to the Ombudsman relating to the treatment of intoxicated detainees and those with a disability, failure to provide timely medical treatment and theft of property. Two weeks before her death, Jack Waterford, the editor-at-large of The Canberra Times, wrote a highly critical editorial on the management of the AFP at that time, in which he opined that the ACT was \\"receiving a second-rate service at Rolls-Royce cost\\" and suggested that the ACT Policing \\"was a complacent and unaccountable organisation of no great competence which is wide open to and may have already been percolated by corruption\\", allegations which were picked up by other ACT media outlets, including the ABC. AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty confirmed that Assistant Commissioner Fagan had felt under pressure as a result of the latest media attention and had sought professional support. Fagan is survived by her second husband Chris Rowell, and daughter Clair from her previous marriage to Andrew Phillips. A funeral with full police honours was held at St Christopher's Cathedral, Canberra on 27 April 2007, after which Fagan was interred at a private family ceremony.

She had been recommended to Mike Stewart by Terry Kirkman, later of The Association, who was then the boyfriend of her sister Barbara.Beverly Bivens, quoted in sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door; http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/There_Stands_The_Door.html; Jerry Burgan with Alan Rifkin (2014) Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution In 1963, she and Glen Campbell, who also played banjo, had performed background vocals on Desert Pete, a recording by the Kingston Trio, of which Stewart's brother John (1939‚Äì2008) was a member. With the addition of Pete Fullerton, the new group, initially called the Ridgerunners and, for a while, the Mike Stewart Quintet, became known as We Five.The name is thought to derive from We Seven (1962), the title of a book by the seven Mercury astronauts They recorded their first album, the highly eclectic You Were on My Mind, for A&M; records in 1965 after Herb Alpert, founder of A&M;, heard them at the \\"hungry i\\", a folk/night club on Jackson Street in the North Beach area of San Francisco. =You Were on My Mind= We Five's first single, from their debut album of the same name, was a reworked version of Sylvia Tyson's song \\"You Were On My Mind\\". It became one of the first folk-rock hits,Richie Unterberger in Mojo, October 2011 reaching number three in the Billboard \\"Hot 100\\" in August 1965.Charlie Gillett & Simon Firth (1976) Rock File 4. This was A&M;'s first hit record that was not made by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass. Tyson (then Sylvia Fricker) says that she was unaware that her song had been covered until she heard We Five's version on a car radio while driving on Highway 101 in California. One consequence of We Five's success was that Tyson's song, which, until then, had been unavailable in sheet form, was published by Witmark of New York, with a photograph of Bivens and We Five on the cover.Tyson's friend (and early girl-friend of Bob Dylan) Suze Rotolo recalled that, in the early days of Ian & Sylvia, Sylvia Tyson's abilities as a songwriter were not acknowledged as people \\"just assumed that Ian was the writer and that she was there to look lovely and sing beautifully\\" (Rotolo (2008) A Freewheelin' Time). However, with the so-called \\"British invasion\\" at its height, We Five's recording had only limited international success, having been covered reluctantly, though successfully, in Britain by Crispian St. Peters.St. Peters reached number two in the British charts in January 1966: Rock File 4 (ed. Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith, 1976). He disliked the song and his recording achieved chart success only after prolonged plugging by his record company, Decca: Brian Matthew, Sounds of the 60s, BBC Radio 2, 17 January 2015. On 2 October 1965, We Five performed You Were on My Mind live on the ABC television show The Hollywood Palace, on which they were introduced by guest comp√®re Fred Astaire. Video footage of this performance survives, as does that of appearances around the same time on the Jack Benny and Bob Hope shows and Shivaree. There have been some claims that Bivens did not sing on the original studio recording of You Were on My Mind and that the female voice was that of another artist. However, most sources, including We Five's Jerry Burgan in his 2014 memoir, have rejected this suggestion.Brian Matthew on BBC Radio 2, Sounds of the 60s, 6 December 2008; Jerry Burgan with Alan Rifkin (2014) Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution =Subsequent singles= A subsequent 1965 single, Chet Powers's (aka Dino Valenti) \\"Let's Get Together\\", was a more modest commercial success, reaching number 31 on the Hot 100. The song, which had been recorded in 1964 by the Kingston Trio, became a much bigger hit in 1969 for the Youngbloods under the shortened title Get Together.See Rock File 4 (ed Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith, 1976)Sounds of the 60s, BBC Radio 2, 28 July 2007 A third single, You Let a Love Burn Out, was trailed by A&M; as a \\"3rd We Five smash in a row\\" on the back of a Grammy nomination for You Were on My Mind.A&M; publicity material reproduced with sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door (2009) Released early in 1966, its \\"twangy-oriental sound\\", with Bivens \\"really put[ting] her voice in front of the others and set[ting] the tempo for the remainder of the group\\"Review by Kathi Koscki (1966), reproduced with sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door (2009) represented a significant departure of style that, in various ways, was to be adopted by other bands in the coming year. However, it made limited public impact, a fate shared in May 1966 by a further single, There Stands the Door (which was coupled with Somewhere, a song from the 1957 musical West Side Story). Pete Fullerton felt that, with both these recordings, \\"there was always that edge of whining\\".Sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door (2009) Influence and style Bivens' voice gave We Five its distinctive and memorable sound. Almost operatic in quality, its range was described as low tenor to high soprano.Sleeve notes for You Were on My Mind (1965) Bob Jones has recalled that \\"Bev had this husky kind of voice, and somehow there's this old soul in there\\".Sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door: The Best of We Five (Big Beat, 2009) Bivens' performances on the album You Were On My Mind and in concert largely foreshadowed a female vocal style that, by 1967, was associated with, among others, Elaine \\"Spanky\\" McFarlane, Grace Slick of the Great Society and Jefferson Airplane,Grace Slick's delivery was rather more \\"edgy\\", being described by James Goodfriend, Music Editor of Stereo Review, as \\"beautifully focused, but [with] the kind of steely edge to it that forbids prettiness\\" (sleeve notes to CBS LP The Best of Grace Slick, 1974). and Cass Elliot and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas. Bivens was said to have inspired Jefferson Airplane's original vocalist Signe Toly Anderson, who was already well established on San Francisco's jazz and folk scene before joining the Airplane. It may be no coincidence either that Karen Carpenter who, like Bivens, had a fine vocal range, was signed by Alpert to A&M;, with her brother Richard, in 1969.A&M; continued over the years to have an instinct for spotting striking female talent. A more recent example was their signing of the Welsh singer Aimee Duffy in 2007. Bivens' influence was apparent too in recordings by some male bands: for example, the Turtles' single Happy Together and the Cowsills' The Rain, the Park and Other Things (both major hits in 1967), as well as I Will Have You (1966) by the seemingly imitative British band, Just Five.Sleeve notes for After Tonight: Ember Beat Vol.3 (1966‚Äì67) (2009). Just Five's lead singer was Sam(uel) Mahood. In 2002, the British newspaper The Independent described We Five as having \\"bridged the gap\\" between Peter, Paul and Mary and the Mamas and Papas;Pierre Perrone, obituary of Michael Stewart, The Independent, 27 November 2002. In Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution (2014), We Five's Jerry Burgan substituted Jefferson Airplane for the Mamas and Papas. indeed, Bivens' voice and that of Mary Travers had a similar atmospheric quality, although Bivens' was the more commanding. In the latter respect, there was a similarity with both Judith Durham of the Australian group the SeekersJerry Burgan has described We Five's approach to Sylvia Tyson's You Were On My Mind as \\"the Seekers, but with balls\\" and drawn attention to similar harmonization on that recording and the Seekers' Georgy Girl (1966): Burgan with Alan Rifkin (2014) Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution. and Dusty Springfield, initially of the Springfields,In the late 1950s, Dusty Springfield, then known by her birth name of Mary O'Brien, had been a member of group called the Lana Sisters. Burgan has observed of Springfield that \\"her epic bluesiness ... was something only another woman ‚Äì only a Beverly ‚Äì might really grasp\\": ibid. who made their names in England in the early to mid-1960s as the lead singers of folk- oriented groups. Others whose vocal delivery has borne comparison have included, in the 1960s, Judy Dyble (the original lead singer of England's premier folk-rock band, Fairport Convention), Kerrilee Male and Dorris Henderson (successive lead singers of Eclection), and, more recently, Lavinia Blackwall of Trembling BellsSee, for example, John Mulvey in Mojo, October 2010 regarding the Bells' being \\"aligned\\" with Fairport Convention and \\"ending up today as a band with a palpable crush on Jefferson Airplane\\". and Zooey Deschanel in her recordings with M. Ward as She & Him.For example, the albums Volume One and Volume Two (Domino, 2008 & 2010) and cover version of the Smiths' Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want for the film (500) Days of Summer (2009). The Sunday Times described Deschanel's songwriting as \\"steeped in sublime West Coast harmonies and references to the classic folk- pop of the 1960s and 1970s\\" (Hardeep Phull, Sunday Times Culture, 21 March 2010). Jerry Burgan has cited Stevie Nicks of the British band Fleetwood Mac. =Personal interests and images= In 1965 Bivens' personal interests were said to be fashions, Chinese food and freedom. As regards fashion, photographs show her wearing dresses whose hemlines were well above the knee in 1965, at a time when the mini-skirt, which, in England, became a defining symbol of \\"Swinging\\" London, had yet to make a wide impact in America.See, for example, Lisa Law (1987) Flashing on the Sixties. The mini-skirt really only took off internationally after British model Jean Shrimpton caused much controversy by wearing a shift dress four inches above the knee at Derby Day, first day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival in Australia on 30 October 1965: see Shrimpton (1990) My Autobiography. Bivens was then 5 foot 3 inches tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes.Interview with Tiger Beat c. 1965, reproduced in sleeve notes for CD There Stands the Door: The Best of We Five (Big Beat, 2009). Musicologist Alec Palao has described her as \\"a petite powerhouse with demurely attractive looks [and] a penchant for European style\\".Alec Palao, notes for CD There Stands the Door (2009) Surviving television clips capture her rather chic, mod style of dress, with bobbed hair and go-go boots. She was sometimes mistaken for the actress Barbara Feldon, co-star of the television series Get Smart, who also had a bob.Jerry Burgan with Alan Rifkin (2014) Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution. Bivens appears to have adopted a bob, then extremely fashionable in England, at some point in 1965. Some photographs from that year, including one by Lisa Law, reveal a slightly longer style, parted in the middle. Photographs on the sleeve of You Were on My Mind show her with the bob, the style seen also in October 1965 on the Hollywood Palace television show and the cover of KYA Beat. Some have even likened her bob to that of Paul McCartney of the Beatles. Bivens' relatively brief career covered a period in which she was one of a fairly small number of female rock musicians: her classic style, at least until 1966, was in contrast to the more Bohemian look favored by contemporaries like Grace Slick or Janis Joplin. At that time Bivens' favorite band was the Beatles, \\"... which is fairly obvious. I haven't really heard any that I really like besides the Beatles\\".Interview with Tiger Beat. Others, including Michelle Phillips (Mamas and Papas) and John Sebastian (Lovin' Spoonful), have described the inception of folk-rock as essentially a fusion of folk music and the Beatles, epitomised by the Byrds' recording of Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man (1965): Folk America, Part III (BBC2, February 2009). Many years later, she recalled that, when We Five played in Pittsburgh in late 1965 with another English band, the Rolling Stones, she had been ignored by the Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger when she had tried to introduce herself. Jerry Burgan recalled that she was shunned also by Jagger's fellow band-member Brian Jones. On another occasion, Bivens defended Peter Noone, the young lead singer of Herman's Hermits, whose apparent lack of self-control was criticized by other members of We Five, pointing out that he was only seventeen and was not, in her view, being managed properly. In October 1965 KYA, a leading San Francisco radio station, used a large photographic portrait of Bivens to draw attention to its inaugural International Pop Music Awards (maybe patronising her a little in the process with its caption, \\"Wee One of the We Five\\").KYA Beat, 23 October 1965, vol 1, number 13 Other photographs of Bivens included those of We Five taken by Lisa Bachelis (later Lisa Law), using a Leica given to her by the group's manager and producer Frank Werber (1929‚Äì2007), who also managed the Kingston Trio, of which, as noted, Mike Stewart's brother, John, was a member.As both Mike Stewart's brother and a member of the Werber stable, Stewart was an influence on the development of We Five, a factor recalled by Jerry Burgan following John Stewart's death on 19 January 2008. Stewart had left the Cumberland Three to replace Dave Guard in the Kingston Trio, which, unlike many other folk groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s, eschewed politics and wore matching short sleeved shirts and short haircuts (Donald Clarke (1995) The Rise and Fall of Popular Music). Suze Rotolo recalled that she, Bob Dylan and Ian and Sylvia Tyson had scorned the cover of a Kingston Trio album \\"because the trio looked so collegiate and square in the photo\\" (A Freewheelin' Time, op.cit.). Shortly before leaving the Trio in 1967, Stewart wrote the Monkees' hit Daydream Believer, and in 1968 worked for Robert F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign. Burgan has described Stewart as his mentor. We Five sometimes used Werber's home at Mill Valley to rehearse; one photograph taken there shows Bivens barefoot in a bikini top and jeans, while the group used, among other things, a broom in place of a microphone.Lisa Law (1987) Flashing on the Sixties Bivens appeared barefoot also on the cover of You Were On My Mind, walking along a beach in a reddish-orange tunic, accompanied by her male colleagues, all fully shod and wearing matching turtlenecks. Bivens enjoyed sunbathing: she was once admitted to hospital on tour with second degree burns after Burgan, who had been called to her room, found her in considerable pain, wearing only the lower half of a bikini. 1966‚Äì67: Split of We Five We Five were in the vanguard of the San Francisco bands, including Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, that reached international prominence in the \\"Summer of Love\\" of 1967.In the early days of We Five there was only a cluster of bands in San Francisco, but by December 1966 there were some 1,500 flourishing in the Bay Area: Myra Friedman (1973) Janis Joplin: Buried Alive However, the original band had disbanded by then. Jerry Burgan and Pete Fullerton reformed We Five. Burgan's wife, Debbie, n√©e Graf, who sang with a group called the Legendaires and had sometimes worked with the Ridgerunners (as they then were), took over from Bivens as lead vocalist. A group known as We Five was still performing forty years later. In his notes for We Five's second album, Make Someone Happy (1967), released after they had split (an episode that later give rise to unfounded rumours that Bivens had been killed in a road accident), satirist George Yanok observed that > \\"We 5 was the first \\"electric band\\" to come out of San Francisco. It > predated the entire present \\"happening\\" in the Haight-Ashbury [a district of > San Francisco that became the centre of \\"flower power\\"] with all its > attendant trippery and hang-overs ‚Ä¶\\".Sleeve notes for LP, Make Someone Happy > (1967) Yanok asserted also that \\"there was nothing psychedelic or arcane about We 5's music\\". However, various elements of the music of the psychedelic era, notably Bivens' vocal delivery, which Yanok described as \\"a major reason for this [We Five's] special something\\", were plainly discernible in We Five's output (for example, on Let's Get Together and such tracks as If I Were Alone,You Were on My Mind LP (1965) Love Me Not Tomorrow, You Let A Love Burn OutMake Someone Happy LP (1967) and Bivens' blues solo on Judy Henske's High Flying Bird, which she has described as \\"like her heart song\\").Sleeve notes for CD, There Stands the Door: The Best of We Five (Big Beat, 2009) =Circumstances of the split= The precise reasons for the break-up of the original group remain unclear, although there has been periodic speculation and comment over the years. Most versions have tended to focus on Bivens herself. Jerry Burgan recalled that, among a number of complicating factors, some of band, notably Mike Stewart, were \\"frankly in love\\" with her and has referred to, in his words, \\"an instinctive caution innate either to Beverly or to young women generally [in the mid 1960s] whose ties to social tradition were all about to unravel\\". The official website of the latter-day We Five, which was in a position to capture the collective memory of some its original members, explained that \\"Beverly turned her back on stardom to marry ... [to] explore experimental music, and become a mom\\". A year before her marriage, she had described touring without her boyfriend as \\"a big drag\\"Interview with Tiger Beat, c.1965 and has since reflected that, by the time of the split, she was \\"kinda dancing\\" and that her husband was having an influence on her.Sleeve notes for There Stands the Door (2009) However, there have been suggestions that, among other things, differences within the group and aspects of its management were also factors.An Internet \\"blog\\" posted in 2002 contained the text of an e-mail purportedly from Bob Jones of the original We Five. Though dating the split of the group to 1969 (which must surely be a mistake), Jones noted, among other things, that \\"Bev went on to sing \\"free jazz\\" with her husband\\" and that Jerry Burgan obtained the rights to the name of We Five from Bivens, Stewart and himself. There was perhaps a hint of discord in Jones' recollection of the re-formed group that \\"except for an unfortunate gig we did together in the North Bay later, I was never involved in any of that\\" Clackscellar.com Bivens was not the only member of We Five who abandoned a performing career prematurely. Peter Fullerton left the music business altogether around 1970 to work with homeless people in the Bay Area and much later put out two albums of mostly religious music to benefit his charity, the \\"Truck of Love.\\" Despite her undoubted magnetism and the powerful effect she seems to have had on her colleagues, Bivens was, in some respects, an \\"outsider\\". She was the only female member of We Five, while the four men all went to college together: Stewart, Jones and Burgan were graduates of the University of San Francisco, and Fullerton knew Stewart and Burgan from their days at a junior college in Los Angeles County, Mt. San Antonio College. The academic background of each was recorded prominently on the sleeve of You Were On My Mind, together with the information that Bivens had attended junior college. There were other mild hints of condescension: the same sleeve notes recognised that Bivens' \\"unusual brilliance and vocal range is the basis of our sound\\" and that she was \\"the spark of the group\\", but referred also to her \\"genuine involvement in singing and desire to learn\\", while, many years later, the We Five website referred curiously to Stewart and Burgan's having added \\"the sound of a female voice that was eventually to be made famous by Beverly Bivens\\". (This is perhaps consistent with another, possibly ironic, sleeve reference to Bivens' instrument as her throat, although it may allude also to the Ridgerunners' original female singer, Sue Ellen Davies, a coloratura whom the other members had met at Claremont High.See sleeves notes to CD There Stands the Door (2009). Jerry Burgan recalled that Davies \\"started singing along, and Michael [Stewart] locked onto the sound that you could get from a girl\\" (ibid.)) =Issues of achievement and management= The original We Five, and Bivens in particular, did not fulfill their potential during their rather short career. They were managed by Frank Werber, and the production of their recordings was handled by Werber's own company, Trident, rather than by A&M; Records. In a 2002 Jerry Burgan attributed the band's collapse in part to the band's management, reflecting that \\"the dissolution was rooted in unfocused management that permitted a very young group to have too much autonomy. We factionalized into a blues contingent, a pop contingent, and an 'I'm out of here' contingent.\\" Despite Herb Alpert's own recording success, A&M; was a rather small record label compared (for example) to RCA, who signed We Five's local contemporaries Jefferson Airplane.Grace Slick (1998) Somebody to Love? The band's success was greatly hindered by the fact that their second album, with Bivens as the lead singer, was not released until late 1967, over a year after it was recorded and six months after the band's final concert in May 1967 in Winona, Minnesota.Sleeve notes to CD There Stands the Door (2009) In 1968 We Five were among a number of A&M;'s artists included in an injunction by a Los Angeles court prohibiting the \\"pirating\\" of their recordings by a company named Superba Tapes.Los Angeles Times, 13 April 1968 We Five are sometimes dismissed as a \\"one hit wonder\\", although they actually had two charting singles and were the highest charting 1960s band from San Francisco until Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1969.By comparison, Jefferson Airplane had only two top 20 hits (the highest, \\"Somebody to Love\\" reached number five in 1967), while the Grateful Dead never had a top 20 hit. Jimi Hendrix had several hits in the UK, including a posthumous number one (\\"Voodoo Chile\\"), but his only top 20 entry in the US was \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (1968). By the mid-1960s albums were seen increasingly as more significant, especially artistically, than singles. Jerry Burgan spoke more kindly of the band's management in 2007, recalling that Werber \\"had an ability to encourage creativity and the musical process without having to direct it. While encouraging us [We Five] to write, to sing, and to play, he surrounded us with a team that shaped all of the other elements which led to our success\\". However, there may be a certain implication in Burgan's further observation that \\"we were too young to see it at the time, but I later learned to appreciate the impact he had on my life\\". The 2009 compilation, There Stands the Door, to which all the surviving members of the original We Five contributed recollections, was dedicated to \\"the late, great Frank Werber\\". =Bivens in retrospect= The two albums featuring Bivens were re-released as a compilation compact disc by Collectors' Choice Music in 1996DPSM 5172 (distributed by PolyGram) and a further compilation, including some previously unreleased recordings, including jingles for Coca-Cola, was issued in 2009 by Big Beat under the title of There Stands The Door: The Best Of We Five. Because of her short period of contemporaneous fame, Bivens has remained a rather elusive figure, but one whose voice has plainly been cherished by many who heard her in the mid-1960s. Although Mike Stewart appears to have been the \\"engine\\" of We Five, putting in extra hours to attend to arrangements of the group's material,Los Angeles Times, 9 May 1965 George Yanok's notes for Make Someone Happy were perhaps revealing in that they concentrated on Bivens' centrality to We Five virtually to the exclusion of the other members: according to Yanok, she was \\"totally honest, gifted and possessed\\". Yanok also observed that We Five's music was about \\"fun\\" and that it was \\"unfortunate that that 'fun', in this age [i.e. 1967], has become equated with frivolity and dismissed as trivia\\". Even so, although Bivens' documented recording career lasted less than two years and extended to little more than two dozen tracks, it seems very likely that, had she remained in the industry (and there was no suggestion that she herself ‚Äì \\"the miniskirt-wearing, free spirit of the band\\"Description of Bivens by journalist Steve Thorn, who interviewed Pete Fullerton at length in 2008, Sandiegotroubadour.com ‚Äì had become pass√©e), George Yanok wrote simply that Bivens (like Bob Jones, who was also not part of the reformed We Five) was \\"making individual plans of [her] own\\": sleeve notes for Make Someone Happy (1967). her soaring voice would have made her a big star. She herself has confirmed that \\"A&M; called, they wanted me, but I think my husband [Fred Marshall, whom she married in 1966] insisted he produce the records ... I'd been working hard for a long time and just thought I'd take a break ‚Äì turned out to be a couple of decades!\\" Late 1960s: Fred Marshall and the Light Sound Dimension On February 13, 1966, at the age of 19, Bivens married jazz bassist Fred Marshall (Frederick Calvin Marshall, 4 October 1938 ‚Äì 14 November 2001).Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 16 July 2000; 22 November 2001Ancestry.com. California Marriage Index, 1960‚Äì1985 [database on- line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2007. Original data: State of California. California Marriage Index, 1960‚Äì1985. Microfiche. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. Marshall had worked with a number of West Coast rock bands and been a member of the Vince Guaraldi Trio which famously recorded the incidental music for television specials based on the Peanuts cartoons of Charles Schulz.The first special for CBS was A Charlie Brown Christmas, broadcast on 9 December 1965. Guaraldi had been an habitu√© of the hungry i club and Marshall's own band, the Ensemble, played at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on the same bill as Jefferson Airplane on the night in October 1966 that Grace Slick first sang as their lead vocalist. In 1966, Marshall began to collaborate with lighting technician Bill Ham (William Gatewood Ham, born 26 September 1932), who is generally credited with creating the first psychedelic light show, a concept that originated in the \\"beat\\" era of the 1950s and became a feature of many late 1960s rock concerts.Frieze Magazine, issue 46 (May 1999) Together with Jerry Granelli, who, in addition to playing on We Five's first album, had also worked with GuaraldiJerrygranelli.com and been a close associate of the songwriter and producer Sly Stone, they formed the Light Sound Dimension (which, as with the Beatles' 1967 song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, many were quick to notice bore the initials LSD), an \\"audio visual multi media group\\" combining lighting technology and experimental music.Billhamlights.com The LSD, which continued into the 1990s, established itself at various West Coast venues, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Fillmore Auditorium (which, with its \\"omnipresent pot smoke\\" noted by songwriter Carole King,King recalled that \\"the light shows were best appreciated under the influence of the omnipresent pot smoke at the Fillmore, where contact was high and unavoidable unless you literally didn't inhale\\": Carole King (2012) Natural Woman. became known for its psychedelic posters), and appeared with, among others, Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Grateful Dead. =Vocal experimentation= After leaving We Five, Beverly Bivens sang for a while with the LSD, her work including vocal experimentation paralleling Yoko Ono's. A photograph taken backstage in 1968 at the LSD's own theater in San Francisco (which ran for about 18 months from January 1968) shows Bivens and Marshall with Ham, Granelli, saxophonist Noel Jewkes (born 18 June 1940) and Ham's assistant Robert (Bob) Fine. One observer wrote at the time that: > Using rear projection to flood a wide screen with essentially liquid images, > and large speakers to project highly amplified jazz-electronic > improvisations, the LSD. is an intensely dedicated, highly gifted group of > light artists and musicians who carry abstract light-sound art to perhaps > its ultimate in purity and concentration.Thomas Albright, 24 August 1968, > quoted in The Rolling Stone Rock 'n' Roll Reader (ed Ben Fong-Torres, 1974) Less prosaically, Jewkes recalled the LSD as \\"far out ... It was a mind opening experience. We were on the cutting edge, you might say, back then\\". Family and later activities =1970s‚Äì1980s= During the 1970s, Bivens appears to have done some session recording, as well as making occasional appearances on television and recording radio jingles. Until Bivens & Marshall divorced in 1978, the couple raised two children in Berkeley, California: the saxophonist Joshi Marshall, who was born in Berkeley in 1971, and a daughter, Zoe Terry Marguerite. In 2014 Joshi, who has a son, Elijah Cole, with wife Leah,Joshimarshall.com recalled an unorthodox childhood which was dominated by his parents' passion for music: \\"Everything was about music and art. It was like, you sleep here and you sleep there, and you have to be part of our trip ... But I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything, there was so much love\\". An earlier publicity biography of Joshi stated that, while still at Berkeley High School in the latter half of the 1980s, he would \\"play in and host sessions with his mother ... and many notable jazz musicians which included saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and pianist, Benny Green.\\"Leftcoasthorns.com However, Bivens' career after leaving We Five is not well documented publicly and, until Jerry Burgan published a memoir of the early folk-rock scene in 2014,Jerry Burgan with Alan Rifkin (2014) Wounds to Bind: A Memoir of the Folk-Rock Revolution sketchy information was derived mainly from recollections posted on the Internet. Various rumours that she had died persisted for many years. =1990s and early 21st century= Jerry Burgan reported that, when he spoke to Bivens in 1999, she was not singing professionally. After Fred Marshall died in Oakland in 2001, an obituary published in his home state of Arkansas referred to Bivens' still living in Berkeley and to his having had another partner of long standing.Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 22 November 2001. However, it appears that, when Marshall fell ill, Bivens stepped in to care for him. In the mid 1990s Bivens was said by Burgan to be doing up an old house. This was subsequently sold and, when Burgan saw her in 2013, she was living in \\"a warehouse district\\" between Berkeley and Richmond. =Re-emergence (2009) and Jerry Burgan memoir (2014)= Joshi Marshall recorded \\"special thanks\\" to his mother in connection with his album In the Light, released in May 2009.Joshimarshall.com , Marshall extended thanks also to his wife and sister and the album was dedicated to Fred Marshall. The sleeve notes for Big Beat's retrospective CD of We Five's recordings, released in 2009, contained several reminiscences by BivensThere Stands the Door: The Best of We Five (Big Beat CDWIKD 286, 2009) and, on 24 September of that year, she sang High Flying Bird at the opening of an exhibition, mounted by the Performing Arts Library & Museum in San Francisco, of the rock scene in the Bay area in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. Asked by an ABC reporter if the latter appearance marked a resumption of her singing career, she remarked teasingly \\"God, I hope so. That would be awesome\\". A memoir by Burgan, touching on Bivens' years in the Ridgerunners/We Five, her impact on the early folk-rock scene and subsequent 40-year seclusion was published in April 2014 by Rowman & Littlefield. It is clear from this that Bivens has remained very circumspect about her life since We Five, and apart from her appearance in 2009, has resisted attempts to encourage her to sing again. Even when she and Burgan visited Bob Jones during his final illness in 2013, she was unwilling to sing \\"High Flying Bird\\", which the men strummed on their guitars, an omission for which, according to Burgan, she expressed regret during the return journey. The three were, however, photographed together. Discography: We Five (with Beverly Bivens) =Albums= The tracks shown in italics were solo (S) or largely solo performances by Beverly Bivens.

The Wildcats won the first Conference League Championship in their history in 2008 after winning the Conference League play-offs. They closed down in 2010. In 2019 they are racing at Wimborne Road, the home of Poole Pirates in the newly formed Midland Southern Development League and hoping to relocate into Weymouth soon. History Speedway at the Wessex Stadium started in 1954 under the promotion of J W Coates, R Barzilay and W J (Bill) Dutton. In 1955 Weymouth entered National League Division 2. Early names for the club were Weymouth Scorchers and Weymouth Royals. When the British League formed a second division in 1968, Wally Mawdsley and Pete Lansdale entered a team from Weymouth which was known as Weymouth Eagles. The Eagles finished ninth out of 10 in the 1968 Division 2. Harry Davis, in 1974, teamed up with Boston promoters Cyril Crane, Gordon Parkins and Ted Holding to enter the (renamed) Weymouth Wizards in British League Division 2. In 1975 the Wizards finished in last place out of 20 teams in the League (renamed from British League Division 2 in 1974 to National League). 1978 saw yet another new name, Weymouth Wildcats and new colours (red and white replacing the purple and white), Len Silver (Hackney) taking over as promoter. But Len Silver withdrew from the promotion of Weymouth Speedway during the winter of 1978/79, following a disagreement over terms for using the stadium and Allied Presentations (the promotion at Reading) stepped in to take over the licence. Early in 1980 Allied Presentations announced that they would no longer promote Speedway in Weymouth leading to local businessman Mervyn Stewkesbury becoming the new promoter. In 1981, the Wildcats finished runners-up in the League. 1983 Weymouth retained the National League Pairs Championship. In 2003, after a break of nearly twenty years, former rider and childhood fan Brian White fulfilled a personal dream of bringing speedway racing back to Weymouth. This time the Wildcats returned at a new venue, the Wessex Stadium. In speedway terms, White called it \\"the greatest week of his life\\". Bringing the sport back to the area was no easy task for White, who overcame large opposition and many obstacles. Planning permission was initially turned down in the hamlet of Buckland Ripers, and whilst the proposal seemed to have the local council's backing, a 400-name petition against the establishing of a speedway team there soon stopped the plan in its tracks. Whilst many would simply have given up at this setback, White persevered, and was eventually persuaded to re-start talks with Weymouth F.C. about the possibility of racing at the Wessex Stadium. After long negotiations and two and a half years of hard work, White's dream was finally realised when West Dorset District Council gave the needed approval for the Wildcats' return on Thursday, 3 July 2003. White pencilled in the official return of speedway in Weymouth for Saturday, August 2 2003, where riders competed in the Wessex Rosebowl in front of 2500 fans. The winner of the meeting was rider Justin Elkins. White and everybody who helped him were lauded and given widespread praise. Former Wildcats' captain Martin Yeates was quoted as saying, \\"what Brian White has done here is amazing. He's given the town back their beloved sport and this time I just hope it's here to stay\\". Former Australian national team boss Neil Street also added, \\"I kept having to pinch myself to make sure I was watching speedway in Weymouth again. It's been a long wait for the return of the sport and what a way to bring it back\\". In November 2010 the club was shut down after their landlords, Morgan Sindall and Wessex Delivery, repossessed the track for non-payment of rent. Despite attempts by local businessman, Harold Doonan, to re-open the club, the landlords subsequently dismantled and removed the track and applied to West Dorset District Council for permission to use the land for open storage. In 2017 they were entered into the newly formed SDL league with James Tresadern and Martin Peters as co- promoters and co-owners. After a successful season racing out of Plymouth Speedway in 2017 they moved to Eastbourne for 2018. In 2019 they have moved to the home of the Poole Pirates. For the 2019 season, Adrian Young and Malcolm Brown were made up to Commercial Managers to run the business side of the team.

His 2004 release SWAY found an audience when his song Smile was chosen by the Apple iTunes Music Store as their Single of The Week. Other songs from SWAY including Bleed and Forgiven soon found their way into hit television shows such as ALIAS and What About Brian. He followed SWAY with a mini EP titled THE STRING SESSIONS reinterpreting the songs from SWAY acoustically with a string quartet. Michael wrote all string arrangements which were then performed by The Section Quartet. In 2005 Michael worked with producer Desmond Child to arrange and record songs for American Idol's Season 4 Showstoppers Album resulting in an RIAA Certified Gold Record. Following the American Idol success he has turned his attention to music production producing tracks for Honey County, Quincy Coleman, Graham Colton, Courtney Jaye, Dilana, Paulina Gretzky and Chelsea Williams as well as writing songs included in NBC's hit comedy My Name Is Earl. Currently Michael is composing, producing and arranging music for television, film and media. He recently composed the themes and underscore for NBC's hit game show The Wall hosted by Chris Hardwick  Biography  Michael Lord‚Äôs varied experience and notable collaborations bring him a unique perspective as a composer. Michael found early success as a member of bands with deals on Atlantic and Island/Def Jam, touring the US, garnering heavy rotation on radio/MTV and Top 20 Billboard chart success. Those experiences opened the door to his collaboration with exceptional producers such as Eric Valentine and T-Bone Burnett, with whom he evolved his production chops. Striking out on his own, Michael‚Äôs music found an audience when Apple chose his track Smile from his self-produced album Sway as their iTunes Single of Week. This opened the door for numerous placements for his music, including in Alias, Brothers and Sisters, My Name is Earl and Laguna Beach, as well as song arrangement and production opportunities including the Brown Betty musical episode of FOX‚Äôs Fringe and the American Idol Showstopper‚Äôs album, which was certified Gold by the RIAA. Michael‚Äôs considerable song placements established him as a production music force and led to him co-creating the original music package for A&E;‚Äôs hit Duck Dynasty, the theme for nationally syndicated entertainment based talk show Hollywood Today Live (FOX/Media General), as well as music for over 200 other shows. Establishing a footprint in the scripted world, Michael collaborated with actor/director Ricky Schroder to compose a modern Americana score and original songs for Schroder‚Äôs film, Our Wild Hearts, as well as Schroder‚Äôs US Army project Starting Strong. Michael was then chosen to score various features, including the adaptation of NY Times bestseller Jessica Darling‚Äôs It List. Taking note of Michael‚Äôs scoring skills, prominent music producer Jay Ruston enlisted Michael to re-envision a track for metal legends ANTHRAX on their comeback album, Worship Music. Michael created a hybrid orchestration of metal married to dark, ambient underscore for the bonus track remix version of The Crawl. In 2017 Michael joined with prolific television producer Andrew Glassman to compose the themes and underscore for NBC‚Äôs game show The Wall, hosted by Chris Hardwick with LeBron James as executive producer. Now entering its third season on NBC, The Wall is a multinational hit format being produced on 6 stages with over 30 international versions in association with Endemol/Shine. Michael‚Äôs themes/underscore are used in all international versions. Premiering in June 2019, Michael‚Äôs themes and underscore will be an integral part of FOX‚Äôs game show Spin the Wheel co-created by Andrew Glassman and Justin Timberlake and hosted by Dax Shepard. A native of Los Angeles, Michael began playing the piano at age 5. He studied classical piano, guitar, drums, and composition. Lord was the recipient of the Chick Corea Jazz Masters Scholarship while he attended the Berklee College of Music.

Birth and Early Life Meesum ibn YahyƒÅ was born at Nihrawan, an area near Kufa.KamƒÅl, Sayyid. Maytham Al-Tammar. Trans. Jasim Alyawy. Qum, Iran: Ansariyan Foundation, n.d. Print. He was the son of YahyƒÅ. Hence, ibn YahyƒÅ (which means son of YahyƒÅ). = Early life = A lady from Banu Asad bought Meesum (as a slave).

Canada, Toronto. Thaqlain, 29 Nov. 2009. Web. 05 July 2013. But after Meesum was freed from the shackles of slavery, he no longer was addressed as a Mawali. The second and most famous title given to Meesum was al-Tammar. Tammar stems from the Arabic word Tammer. In Arabic, Tammer means dates (a type of fruit). Therefore, al-Tammar means \\"the date seller\\".Tabataba'i, Hossein Modarressi, and Hossein Modarressi. Tradition and Survival: A Bibliographical Survey of Early Shƒ´'ite Literature. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oneworld, 2003. Print. p. 42 In Hebrew, Tamar means palm tree, date palm, or dates.\\"View Name: Tamar\\". Behind the Name. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 July 2013. Meesum received the title al- Tammar because he owned a market store in Kufa where he would sell dates and other types of fruit. In addition, al-Kufi was another title given to Meesum.Tabataba'i, Muhammad. The Return to Being. Trans. Fazel Amjad and Mahdi Bozorgi. London, England: ICAS, 2009. Print. Pg.17 Al-Kufi simply means a person from Kufa. Freedom from slavery After the time of Muhammad and the caliphate of Uthman, Imam Ali became Caliph in the year 656 AD. As the new caliph (after Uthman ibn Affan's death), Imam Ali moved the Islamic capital from Medina to Kufa for two reasons: to keep Mu'awiyah in check, and because Kufa had an illustrious history (many prophets of Allah lived in Kufa). Moving to Kufa, Imam Ali use to go around the city of Kufa. It is documented that if he encountered a slave he would try to free him or her. One day, Imam Ali saw a lady from the Banu Asad tribe, who had a male slave of Nabataean origin (Mawali). Imam Ali approached the woman and began to converse with her, in order to purchasing the slave, Salim. The two started to negotiate a price, and the lady's initial asking price was 50 dinar. As Imam Ali gave her the 50 dinar she changed the price to 100 dinar. She kept raising the price, since she realized that Imam Ali was willing to pay her a much higher price. Seeing the price soar, a companion of Imam Ali then asked, \\"O Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali), who is this man? What is he? He's originally a Nabataean , he is a slave, what the point of paying this much?\\" Finally, she settled at 500 dinar. Imam Ali handed her the 500 dinar. She then called Salim and stated to him that Imam Ali has purchased you. After buying Salim, Imam Ali set him free from the shackles of slavery for the way of Allah. It demonstrated the Islamic view of slavery; Islam establishes that slavery is immoral and that all humans are equal in the perspective of Allah. The only thing that differentiates a human is their Taqwa. Islam called for a gradual emancipation of slaves.Khattab, A. M. Islam's Position on Slavery. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. p. 2Ahmad, Mirza B.

Moreover, a person who frees a slave is showered with blessing and would be protected from hell fire.Maudoodi, Syed Abul  ªAla. Human Rights in Islam. Leicester: Islamic Foundation, 1976. Print. p. 20 = Mesum's first encounter with Imam Ali = After Imam Ali set him free, he greeted Salim by the name Meesum. Meesum was the name that his mother gave to him after his birth; no one in Kufa knew that Meesum was Salim's real name. Upon hearing a stranger calling him by Meesum, Salim was shocked, baffled, and astonished that a person other than his parents knew about his real name (Meesum). He questioned Imam Ali as to how did he knew that Meesum was his real name. Imam Ali replied, \\"Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle (Prophet Muhammad) has told me that the Iranians call you Meesum. Still shocked, Meesum willing went with Imam Ali who would later become his best friend and teacher. Salim (a.k.a. Meesum) himself narrates this event: :Imam Ali: \\"Salamu alaykum Meesum.\\" :Salim: \\"What did you say?\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Salamu alaykum Meesum.\\" :Salim: \\"Nobody knows my name except my parents. How did you know my name?\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Do not worry, there are areas of knowledge that I may know, which you do not know. Come near me. I want you to come with me.\\" :Salim: \\"How did you know my name? There is no one in Kufa that knows me by Meesum. My mother named me Meesum. Only a person of great knowledge knows that thats my original name.\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Come with me do not worry. Allah's Apostle (Prophet Muhammad) has told me that the Iranians call you Meesum.\\" :Salim: \\"Allah and His Apostle are truthful.\\" Other narrations state that Imam Ali tells Salim, \\"Your name is Meesum, you are Iranian, you are of Iranian origin. Be proud of your Iranian origin.\\"Razawi, Ali Abbas. \\"Maytham Al-Tammar\\". N.p., 25 Jan. 2013. Web. 05 July 2013. The Counterfeit Money Incident The caliph, Imam Ali, would at times visit the market place of Kufa. In his visits he would stop by Meesum's store to converse with him. One day, Meesum was at his market store in Kufa selling dates. Imam Ali approached Meesum and said to him to take a prayer break. Other variants of this event state that Imam Ali told Meesum to take a break and visit his family. Another variant states that Meesum went to go buy something. Before leaving, Meesum requested Imam Ali to sell some dates. While Meesum was gone, Imam Ali looked over his shop. A shopper came looking to buy some dates. He looked around and them purchased four dates from Imam Ali. Some variants say he purchased four Dirhams worth of dates. But he purchased the dates using counterfeit money (fake money). Eventually, Meesum returned to his stall and asked Imam Ali if he managed to sell any dates. Imam Ali tells Meesum he sold some dates and handed Meesum the money. Meesum was shocked that Imam Ali sold the dates and did not realize that the money was fake. However, Imam Ali mentions to Meesum to remain patient because the shopper would come back for a reason. Meesum became confused, he had a feeling that the shopper would not come back because he essentially got free dates. A couple hours passed by, the man returned to Meesum's market shop upset at the taste of the dates that he recently purchased from the ruling caliph of the time, Imam Ali. The man requested for a return. Imam Ali then tells the man the dates were bitter because the money you gave was bitter (fake). The man was surprised and astonished. He then took his counterfeit money and left. Meesum himself narrates this event: :Imam Ali: \\"Meesum go and have a break. Go and pray your Salah. I will look after your date stall.\\" :Meesum: \\"Very well. Try and sell a few dates if you could sell anything.\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Do not worry, just go and pray.\\" (Other variation of this event says that Meesum wanted to go and buy something. Another variation states that Imam Ali said to Meesum to go and give your family some time.) Meesum comes back: :Meesum: \\"O Amir al-Momineen (Imam Ali), did you manage to sell?\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Yes, I managed to sell.\\" :Meesum: \\"How much?\\" :Imam Ali: \\"I managed, Alhamdulillah to sell four dates.\\" (Other variations state that Imam Ali sold four Dirhams (currency) worth of dates.) :Meesum: \\"Where the money?\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Here is the money.\\" :Meesum: \\"Imam this person has given you bitter money (fake money). It's not real.\\" :Imam Ali: \\"Meesum sit down, do not worry. Allah will provide Rizq (sustenance/livelihood). The owner of the dirhams (money) will come back.\\" :Meesum: \\"The man bought the dates by false dirhams! Why will he come back?\\" The man returns: :The Man: \\"These dates that you have given me taste bitter.\\" (Some variants say \\"I don't want these dates! They are bitter! Why are they bitter?\\") :Imam Ali: \\"Because the money you gave was bitter\\" (Some variants say \\"Because your dirhams are false!\\") Meesum's Views of Imam Ali Meesum viewed Imam Ali in a very positive light. He saw him as a humble and down to earth Caliph, who sought to teach his fellow citizens manners, religion, and a good lifestyle. Meesum himself says, \\"Only Allah knows what lessons I learned from Ali ibn Abi Talib. I didn't find a human on this earth like Amir al- Momineen (Imam Ali). If you want to see the embodiment of humility, then see what I saw with Ali ibn Abi Talib.Yusufali, Shaneali. \\"Maytham al-Tammar\\". Knowledge 2011: 12-13. Print. p. 12 He also says, \\"Ali ibn Abi Talib is the caliph of the state and I am a Tammar (date seller). Amir al-Momineen would come and sit by me. I would be there, I would sell dates. He would come and sit near me. Which king would sit next to a man selling dates. Whereas Ali ibn Abi Talib would come, sit near me. Look at the humility of the man (referring to Imam Ali).\\" Furthermore, people who knew the caliph, Imam Ali, were astonished to find him at times sitting next to a Tammar (date seller) conversing. Teachings of Imam Ali As the cousin of Muhammad, Ali would follow his footsteps and educate people about the teachings of Islam. He taught/trained many religious scholars both Muslims and non-Muslims.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein, Hamid Dabashi, and Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr. Expectation of the Millennium: Shi ªism in History. Albany: State University of New York, 1989. Print. p. 145Mohammadi, Seyed Ali Farid. Shi'i Hagiography: Highlights about the Lives of Five Illustrious and Eminent Shi'i Personalities. N.p.: University of Michigan, 2013. Print. p. 7 Among these religious scholars was Meesum al-Tammar. Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib took Meesum under his wings, he taught Meesum many secrets about faith, religion, and the world. In addition, he taught Meesum many branches of knowledge, including ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya (esoteric knowledge of future events) and ilm-e-Taweel (interpretation and exegesis of the Quran).Takim, Liyakatali. The Heirs of The Prophet: Charisma and Religious Authority in Shi'ite Islam. Albany: State University of New York, 2007. Print. pp. 93, 122, 129 It is documented that Imam Ali would take Meesum to a nearby desert in the middle of the night to teach him about future affairs/matters/events. At times with the permission of his master/teacher, Meesum used to acquaint the public about the deep secrets that he learned from Imam Ali. On account of the frank speech of Meesum, people used to think that Meesum had lost his head/gone insane. They could hardly understand the depth and logic of his words. Teachings narrated my Meesum: : \\"Ali ibn Abi Talib taught us the first lesson in life that whatever job you have as a human being, if your earning wealth in Halal it's a worship of Allah (God).\\" = Ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya = As a student of Imam Ali, Meesum was taught various categories of knowledge. One of these categories was ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya (the knowledge of death and future calamities). With ilm-e-Manaya wal Balaya, Meesum prophesied specific events that would occur in the future. According to Kashshi and Liyakatali Takim, Meesum possessed supernatural knowledge unmatched by ordinary people. Kashshi also mentions that Meesum's ability to predict future events was a feat that was later matched by Muhammad ibn Sinan. Mesum The Scholar Meesum became one of the top scholars of his time, in part of his desire to increase his understanding about various subjects and the teachings of Imam Ali. People would come to Meesum for explanations of Quranic verses, since he possessed ilm-e-Taweel (interpretation and exegesis of the Quran). Abdullah ibn Abbas is documented to be one of the people that would take lessons from Meesum. Prophecy of death Once Ali ibn Abi Talib, told Meesum that he would be hanged on account of the love for the Imam of his time. He also gave the address and told him that he would be hanged in a farm next to the house of Amr lbn Huraith. The tree on which he would be hanged was the smallest of the ten trees existing in the farm at that time. Meesum was also informed that his tongue would be cut out because he would not stop praising his Imam of time (Ali ibn Abi Talib). After getting this information, it is recorded in history that, Meesum used to go to the tree pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib, clean the place and water the tree and offer prayers saying, \\"O tree! You are for me and I am for you. Months and years passed by, Ali was martyred then Hasan ibn Ali (the Second Shƒ´\`a ImƒÅm) was martyred and Meesum kept waiting for the time. Confrontation with ibn Ziyad In 60 A.H., when Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad was appointed as the Governor of Kufa, things started to get complicated. Meesum then went to perform Hajj and thereafter returned to Kufa. One day, Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, called him and asked him to come to his Court, and said, \\"O Meesum! Inform me where your Allah is?\\" Meesum immediately replied. \\"He is in quest of an opportunity to punish the transgressors.\\" Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him about his connections with Ali ibn Abi Talib. Meesum replied that Ali ibn Abi Talib was his master and that he loved him. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad then asked him, \\"Did your master tell you anything about your end?\\" Meesum replied, \\"Yes, he informed me that I would be hanged and that my tongue would be cut.\\" Ubayd- Allah ibn Ziyad sent a roar of laughter and said, \\"I will see that your master did not tell you the truth. I will see that his prophecy is belied.\\" Meesum said, \\"My master's words are true because he got that information from Allah. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was informed by Jibril, and Jibril came with the message of Allah.\\" Final days and death Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad ordered Meesum to be jailed and sent him to al-Tamura, a fearful prison underground, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi was in the same prison with Meesum. Meesum and Mukhtar would hold conversations in prison but later on the orders of Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad he was ordered to be hanged for creating mischief. Meesum was brought to the same tree to be hanged as pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib. Meesum began singing the praises of his master Ali, and about a thousand people gathered to see Meesum being hanged. Even after being hanged, the tongue of Meesum went on singing the praises of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad was informed about this and the tyrant ordered that the tongue of Meesum to be cut and thus the prophecy of Ali ibn Abi Talib came true and Meesum died after his tongue was cut out. The book Nafasul Mahmoom states that \\"Meesum was martyred ten days before Imam Husain (a.s.) came to Iraq.\\" Imam Hussein entered Sharraf, on the border of Iraq and Hijaz on the 25th of Dhul Hijjah 60AH.Qummi, Abbas.

It has a modular representation of dimension 112 over the finite field with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square, a fact which Norton used to construct it, and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally. and gave computer-free proofs of uniqueness. and gave a computer-free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups 210:SL5(2) and (210:24:A8):2 over a group 210:24:A8. The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial. Since 37 and 43 are not supersingular primes, J4 cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs. Representations The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333; there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension. The smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements. The smallest permutation representation is on 173067389 points, with point stabilizer of the form 211M24. These points can be identified with certain \\"special vectors\\" in the 112 dimensional representation. Presentation It has a presentation in terms of three generators a, b, and c as :\\\\begin{align} a^2 &=b^3=c^2=(ab)^{23}=[a,b]^{12}=[a,bab]^5=[c,a]= \\\\left ((ab)^2ab^{-1} \\\\right)^3 \\\\left (ab(ab^{-1})^2 \\\\right)^3=\\\\left (ab \\\\left (abab^{-1} \\\\right )^3 \\\\right )^4  &=\\\\left [c,(ba)^2 b^{-1}ab^{-1} (ab)^3 \\\\right]= \\\\left (bc^{(bab^{-1}a)^2} \\\\right )^3= \\\\left ((bababab)^3 c c^{(ab)^3b(ab)^6b} \\\\right )^2=1. \\\\end{align} Maximal subgroups found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J4 as follows: * 211:M24 \\\\- containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups; also containing 211:(M22:2), centralizer of involution of class 2B * 21+12.3.(M22:2) - centralizer of involution of class 2A - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups * 210:PSL(5,2) * 23+12.(S5 √ó PSL(3,2)) - containing Sylow 2-subgroups * U3(11):2 * M22:2 * 111+2:(5 √ó GL(2,3)) - normalizer of Sylow 11-subgroup * PSL(2,32):5 * PGL(2,23) * U3(3) - containing Sylow 3-subgroups * 29:28 Frobenius group * 43:14 Frobenius group * 37:12 Frobenius group A Sylow 3-subgroup is a Heisenberg group: order 27, non- abelian, all non-trivial elements of order 3.

Statement of the inequality Let be an interval of the real line and let denote a real-valued, convex function defined on . If and are numbers in such that majorizes , then Here majorization means that and satisfies and we have the inequalities and the equality If is a strictly convex function, then the inequality () holds with equality if and only if we have for all }. Remarks * If the convex function is non-decreasing, then the proof of () below and the discussion of equality in case of strict convexity shows that the equality () can be relaxed to * The inequality () is reversed if is concave, since in this case the function is convex. Example The finite form of Jensen's inequality is a special case of this result. Consider the real numbers and let :a := \\\\frac{x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots+x_n}{n} denote their arithmetic mean.

A co-founder of the Grammy-winning band The Klezmatics, she is considered by many to be the world's foremost living klezmer fiddler. Early life Alicia Svigals, violinist, composer and vocalist, was born on January 8, 1963 in The Bronx, New York City and studied ethnomusicology at Brown University. Career During the 1980s and 1990s, she studied with older klezmer violinist Leon Schwartz with the intent of reviving the style and technique of the klezmer violin tradition which had largely disappeared, and of which few recorded examples remain. Although classically trained since childhood, she also travelled around Europe and Israel in her youth and tried to learn local styles. Of her playing style, she said that it is \\"a combination of old fiddle style, clarinet technique, and this sort of Greek-Turkish timbre [... it's] half reconstructed-half invented.\\" She has taught klezmer to hundreds of students around the world over the past two decades, including violinists Steven Greenman and Itzhak Perlman. Svigals was one of the founders in 1986 of the band the Klezmatics, and co-led the ensemble until 2001. With them, she appeared on A Prairie Home Companion, Rosie O'Donnell's Kids are Punny, Good Morning America, MTV News, Nickelodeon, and NPR's New Sound and Weekend Edition. As a composer for the group, she provided music for the play A Dybbuk by Tony Kushner, and collaborations with poet Allen Ginsberg and Israeli singer Chava Alberstein. They also performed with Itzhak Perlman on PBS' Emmy- winning Great Performances documentary In the Fiddler's House and on the Late Show with David Letterman, and appeared together in concert at Radio City Music Hall, Tanglewood, and Wolf Trap. Svigals has been commissioned to compose for the Kronos Quartet, as well as recording for the television series The L Word. She was awarded the Foundation for Jewish Culture's 2013 New Jewish Culture Network commission for her original score to the 1918 silent Pola Negri film The Yellow Ticket. In 2014 she was an NEA MacDowell Fellow in composition, and a fellow at LABA: A Laboratory for Jewish Culture. She is featured on recordings by such Hasidic artists such as Avraham Fried and Lipa Schmeltzer. She has collaborated with 'second generation' author Thane Rosenbaum, whose novel The Golems of Gotham is based in part on Svigals. She is featured on Herb Alpert‚Äôs 2008 recording of the Yiddish theater song \\"Belz\\", arranged by Marvin Hamlisch. Other recording, performing and composing collaborators include Diane Birch, Gary Lucas, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, John Cale, Ben Folds, John Zorn, Debbie Friedman. Personal life Svigals also has a wedding and bat/bar mitzvah band that plays every genre of music, based in New York and Boston. She is a lesbian.

The firm was formed in late 2017 through the combination of D+H and Misys, after Vista Equity Partners acquired Misys in June 2012 and subsequently purchased D+H in 2017. Finastra is led by chief executive officer, Simon Paris, who was appointed in June 2018. The company has offices in 42 countries with U.S. $1.9 billion in revenues. The company employs over 9,000 people and has ~8,600 customers (including 90 of the world's largest 100 banks, by asset size) across 130 countries.  Misys history  = 1970 to 2000 = The company was founded by Roger Morgan and Kevin Lomax as Misys to develop insurance software. The purchase of multiple companies in respective markets by Misys under the leadership of Kevin Lomax (Chairman and/or CEO 1985‚Äì2006) allowed Misys to become a software supplier to the US healthcare industry, to banks (worldwide) and to fund managers worldwide. Many of the companies acquired and consolidated by Misys were themselves products of previous mergers. In 1987 Misys shares were first traded on the Unlisted Securities Market. It was admitted to the Main List of the London Stock Exchange in 1989, cross selling to increased client base and economies of scale arising from consolidation. In 1994 Misys entered the banking software space by purchasing Kapiti Ltd. In 1995 Misys purchased ACT (which included BIS and Kindle), thus giving Misys control of 3 of the 4 largest selling core banking packages at the time. At time of purchase, Midas had the biggest installed base of any \\"off-the shelf\\" banking software package. The largest banking software company to be brought into the Misys fold was BIS. Business Intelligence Services or BIS Ltd in 1976 had acquired Kingsley-Smith and Associates and a software package named MIDAS developed by KSA. This banking software system was based on a concept of a core multi-currency accounting module. At the time, most other International Banks worldwide worked and accounted on a 'single currency' methodology. It was marketed to and operated by a number of client London Banks from 1979. From the mid to late-1980s competition to MIDAS came from vendors with systems called Kapiti, BankMaster (from Kindle) and IBIS. In 1991 ACT purchased Kindle followed by BIS in 1993 uniting two of the biggest selling products under one ownership albeit with different user bases. Midas was focused on its international branch banking in the world's financial centers. The simplicity of Bankmaster and its Branchpower front end appealed to tier 3 and 4 banks in Africa and South America. Kapiti Ltd was a privately held packaged banking software house focused on using IBM's mid range computers to server the international branch banking market. Kapiti was founded in 1975 by a Mr. John Kennedy, a New Zealand native and competed directly with the commercially more successful Midas system. Initially headquartered in London, the company moved to Windsor then Slough, Berkshire. In 1990 Kapiti re-branded the well established Kapiti International Banking System (KIBS) as EQUATION 1, sales were still focused on international branch banking with clusters of users in financial centers like London, plus some small retail operations in the Gulf. The combination of the port to the new IBM AS/400 platform with its increased processing power, the user friendly EQ2 user interface rework, the performance boost from the EQ3 data base rewrite, and the addition of a client server Cashier system had allowed an expansion into retail banking. Kapiti also pursued wholesale banking by merging with Aregon International (dealing room information feeds), purchasing Future Systems (trade capture) and purchasing rights to some reporting tools. None of the acquired companies prospered under Kapiti. However the technical expertise of the Aregon team was exploited to build in house a trade finance system called Trade Innovation (TI) which saw commercial success for approximately 20 years. In 1996 Misys bought Summit Systems, an American software company selling a front-office cross-asset management system targeting investment banks' trading rooms. In 1997 it bought Medic Computer Systems, a healthcare software business. = 2000 to present = In June 2001 Misys bought DBS Management, a supplier of software to Independent Financial Advisors. In June 2001 Misys bought Sunquest Information Systems, a United States based supplier of medical systems software. In January 2004 Misys bought IQ Financial Systems from Deutsche Bank. In July 2005 Misys bought Almonde. In February 2006 Misys bought Intesio. In March 2006 Misys bought NEOMAlogic. In October 2006 the CEO Kevin Lomax, one of the company's founders, resigned and IBM veteran Mike Lawrie was appointed as his replacement. In July 2007 Misys sold its diagnostic information software division to Vista Equity Partners.Misys Sells Off Sunquest, CPR, Exiting the Hospital Systems Business In October 2008 Misys' subsidiary, Misys Healthcare, was merged with Allscripts, a medical records business, to become Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc. In November 2010 Misys bought Sophis, a provider of portfolio and risk management software.Misys to Buy Software Vendor Sophis for $593 Million Bloomberg, 12 November 2010 In February 2012, Misys entered into merger talks with its Swiss rival Temenos.Misys In Talks Over Merger With Swiss Rival Temenos After Fidelity Failure Bloomberg, 3 February 2012 The deal later collapsed when the two sides were unable to agree to terms. In March 2012 private equity firm Vista Equity Partners announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Misys. In June 2012, upon the completion of acquisition by Vista Equity Partners, Misys was merged with Turaz, another acquisition of Vista. Turaz was formerly the treasury and risk management software division of Thomson Reuters. In February 2014, Misys bought Hungary-based IND Group, a supplier of online and mobile banking software. In August 2014, Misys bought Custom Credit Systems, a US- based supplier of credit workflow and loan origination software. In March 2017, D+H announced that it would be acquired by Vista Equity Partners and combined with Misys In June 2017, the merger with D+H was completed, and the company was rebranded as Finastra In January 2018, Finastra acquired Olfa Soft for its FX e-trading platform for financial institutions. In April 2018, Finastra launched an innovation lab in Hong Kong to enable collaboration between banks and other fintech companies. In June 2018, Finastra announced it acquired Malauzai, a provider of mobile and internet banking solutions for community financial institutions.Finastra Acquires Mobile Banking Provider Malauzai In June 2018, Finastra, launched FusionFabric.cloud, an open platform to develop apps, connect ecosystems and foster collaboration between banks and fintechs. In August 2020, Finastra reported that CIH Bank, a Moroccan commercial bank, went live with Fusion Corporate Channels and Fusion Trade Innovation to digitize its end-to-end banking services for multinational companies. CIH Bank partnered with the Finastra Services team to introduce the software using the Fusion Adopt system which given the difficult circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabled the majority of the project to be deployed remotely.  D+H History  In 1875, D+H was founded as Davis & Henderson, a Canadian manufacturer specialising in bookbinding and printing. By the latter part of the 1890s, Canadian financial institutions began to form a significant portion of D+H customer base. In the 1960s, D+H started to produce printed cheques with Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding and began printing individually personalized bank cheques. It continued to focus on the cheque business through the 1970s and 1980s. Following a series of acquisitions starting in 2005, D+H shifted its business to providing financial technology services worldwide. In 2011, D+H went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It acquired Mortgagebot and ASSET Inc. in 2011, Avista Solutions in 2012, Harland Financial Solutions and Compushare in 2013, and Fundtech in 2015. In 2016, D+H added blockchain technology capabilities to its global payments platform. The added capabilities enabled banks that use its Global PAYplus services platform to access distributed ledgers to connect networks, move money in real time and improve access to liquidity. On 17 June 2017, D+H announced that it would be acquired by Vista Equity Partners and combined with Misys, operating under the new company name Finastra for a total enterprise value of approximately $4.8 billion.

The \\"Palentine Campoo\\" was left, after the provincial division, with Aguilar as the most important township, and included nowadays into the large comarca of Palentine Mountains. Geography thumb Campoo is placed in a transition zone between the Eurosiberian and the Mediterranean regions of the Iberian Peninsula (see Forests of the Iberian Peninsula). Its climate is generally cold and humid, influenced by the Continental (as it is open to the Meseta) and Oceanic climates, the last one smoothed by the √çsar ranges and the Cantabrian Mountains. This climate combination can be observed in very cold winters and gentle summers, with no extreme temperatures. With Reinosa in the middle, we can find a more Mediterranean zone, comprising Valderredible and Valdeolea, and to the North, near the end of the Besaya River, the climate becomes clearly Oceanic. In the H√≠jar mountains is the source of the river of the same name, whose discharge is the main water contribution to the Ebro river, which is born in the locality of Fontibre. This river is dammed near Reinosa, to make one of the largest reservoirs of the hydrographic basin of the Ebro, The Ebro's Reservoir in Arija's wiki acting as main regulator of the Navarre and Riojan irrigated lands. In these same mountain ranges, risen from tectonic movements during the time from the end of the Cretaceous to the Oligocene (alpinotype orogeny), are the highest peaks of the comarca, the Cuchill√≥n (2,225 m) and the Tres Mares (Three Seas; 2,180 m), so called because from its skirts rivers flow to all three Spanish river basins. The Tres Mares is the point where the mountain ranges of √çsar and H√≠jar start, forming at its base a glacial valley open to the whole comarca. From its summits can be seen the Bay of Biscay to the north, the near Picos de Europa to the northwest, the Cantabrian and Palentine Mountains to the southwest, the Meseta Central to the south, and the Pas valleys with the Encartaciones mountains to the east. Flora and fauna Cattle and horse livestock on Campurrian pastures. Umbra√±al beech grove (La Lomba) In the northern slope of the mountains, beech and oak groves of the Saja-Besaya Natural Park spread out; an important nature reserve abundant with red deer, roe deer and golden eagles. The presence of Iberian wolves is not very rare, and brown bears have been sighted, thus considering this zone as an important nexus of communication between isolated populations of this plantigrade. There are also important colonies of griffon vultures in Polientes and the H√≠jar ridges. Other interesting species of animals that populate the comarca are: eagle owls, martens, badgers, stoats and desmans. In addition, the Ebro swamps house a remarkable aquatic avifauna. Among its flora, as well as the mentioned oak and beech groves, there are very important populations of hollies and birches, and also excellent specimens of taxus, all of which are protected by the Spanish law. People The inhabitants of Campoo are called Campurrians (Campurrianos in Spanish) and their language is Spanish, influenced by an Astur-Leonese dialect. The traditional costume is characteristic for its \\"albarcas\\", footwear similar to Asturian clogs, which are exquisitely carved in birch wood (nowadays they are industrially made in beech). Another typical Campurrian accessory is the \\"palo pinto\\", a rod made of hazelnut tree wood and engraved by fire, and which is used to help in walking up the mountains and to beat the livestock. The Campurrian economy has traditionally been connected to cattle, the Campurrians having also good reputation as carters and masons. The Campurrian carters were in charge of making the exchange of merchandising between the Castilian Mesa and the capital of the province (until the administrative reorganization of 1982, Santander was part of Old Castile, and also its capital), constantly redoing the route of the Foramontanos Notebooks of Campoo - The Foramontans that repopulated Castile. Culture The day of Campoo is celebrated the last Sunday of September, as part of Saint Matthew festivities. The main act of the day is a cart parade that show scenes of the traditional everyday life, pulled by oxen and Tudanca cows. Other important festivities are the ones of Los Campanos in Abiada, celebrated the first Sunday of September to commemorate the end of summer by bringing the cows down to the valley from the summer passes, full of regalia; and Las Nieves on August 15 in Naveda. In the comarca there are plentiful buildings of \\"highlander\\" romanesque architecture, among which the Cervatos's and San Mart√≠n de Elines's collegiate churches, the Santa Mar√≠a la Mayor church of Villacantid stand out; other remarkable churches are those of Bolmir y Retortillo, San Andr√©s and San Mart√≠n de Valdelomar. In the Campurrian civil architecture the abundant noble houses stand out, with carved ashlars and sunny spots (Mazandrero, Naveda, Celada, Pesquera, etc.) In military architecture one piece must be remarked, the Arg√ºeso castle, Notebooks of Campoo - The Arg√ºeso Marquessate built on the 12th century and where Don √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, Marquis of Santillana, lived and from where he managed the Lordship of Campoo and his marquessate of Arg√ºeso in the 15th century. Other interesting buildings are the tower Notebooks of Campoo - Medieval Towers of the Bustamantes in the Costana, and also the ones of Ruerrero, of San Mart√≠n de Hoyos, of R√≠os de Proa√±o, and the tower of the G√≥mez-B√°rcenas in San Miguel de Aguayo. The city of Juli√≥briga ruins, Notebooks of Campoo - Juli√≥briga 4 km away from Reinosa, in Retortillo, deserve a special mention. The city was founded by the IV Roman Legion in the 1st century BC upon an old Cantabrian castro. Also, an important battle took place in this area: the Battle of Aracillum (Aradillos), and important chapter in the romanization of Cantabria, which took over 200 years, one of the longest of the whole history of the Roman Empire. The comarca of Campoo was again important in another war episode two thousand years later, during the Spanish Civil War, when the Navarre Brigades broke the resistance of the Popular Front in the H√≠jar ridges, provoking the republican loss of Santander. Present time Halfway during the 1970s, the comarca underwent a depopulation and demographic ageing process, specially due to the decline of the national company \\"La Naval\\" (Forges and Steels of Reinosa), which maintained a previously thriving industry, with credited international prestige in naval and weaponry construction. Notwithstanding, after a traumatic industrial conversion and an important development in tourism, this Cantabrian comarca faces the rade-off between keeping the highly polluting siderurgy or basing its economy on tourism. Nowadays, its main economic resources are the aforementioned tourism and siderurgy industry, as well as the alimentary livestock (specially cattle, but also horses). The growing development of the tourism infrastructure, in spite of being one of the main economic engines of Campoo, is starting to make pressure in the ecologic balance of the zone. This fact has caused the proliferation of ecologist associations involved in the achievement of sustainable development, as the only way to preserve these valleys.

Named for Indra (the god of weather and war, and lord of Svargaloka in Hinduism), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name, and only one of three ships (along with and the Civil War era gunboat ) to be named after a Hindu deity. Construction Originally laid down as LST-1147 on 12 February 1945; reclassified while building and launched as ARL-37 by Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, of Seneca, Illinois, 21 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Regina K. Hlubek; placed in reduced commission and brought to Bethlehem-Key Highway Shipyard, Baltimore, for conversion, and commissioned 2 October 1945, with Lieutenant Commander R. J. Siegelman in command. Service history After shakedown, Indra sailed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she remained from 30 November 1945, until 8 May 1946. She then steamed through the Panama Canal to San Diego, arriving 4 June 1946. The ship remained in California until departing 7 January 1947, for the Far East. Indra arrived at Tsingtao, 19 February 1947, to support the United States Marines there attempting to stabilize the volatile Chinese situation and protect American lives and property. She performed repair and general services there and at Shanghai, until 30 August 1947, when she sailed for San Diego. Upon her arrival on 25 September 1947, Indra was decommissioned on 6 October 1947, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Diego Group. Indra was recommissioned 16 December 1967. During the Vietnam War, Indra participated in the following campaigns: * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV (2 April to 16 April 1968) * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase V (21 September to 1 November 1968) Decommissioned in May 1970, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1984. Transferred to the state of North Carolina in January 1992, she was sunk as an artificial reef off the coast of North Carolina on 4 August 1992.

He was a member of the Czechoslovak Parliament and of the Slovak Assembly. After the Second World War, he was illegally deported to the Soviet Union, sentenced on trumped-up charges at a show trial, and imprisoned. In the meantime he was sentenced, in absentia, to death by the National Court in Bratislava on the charges of High Treason to the State, collaboration with enemy, the breaking-up of Czechoslovakia, and his participation in an anti-democratic regime as a deputy of the Slovak Assembly. The sentence was not executed as a consequence of a Presidential pardon, following his return to Czechoslovakia from Soviet Union. He died in prison in 1957. The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities have described him as a hero for saving Jews during World War II. On the other hand, the Federation of the Jewish Communities in Slovakia have publicly criticised J√°nos Esterh√°zy and rejected efforts to present him as \\"democratic, antifascist fighter and fearless savior of Jews\\". Family Son of Antal Mih√°ly Esterh√°zy, he was born into one of Hungary's most distinguished aristocratic families, the House of Esterh√°zy, in the Gal√°nta branch originated from Transylvania. His mother, Countess El≈ºbieta Tarnowska, daughter of Professor Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski, was Polish. He was four when his father died. He went to secondary school in Budapest and after studying commerce he returned to his estate in an area of Hungary which the Treaty of Trianon had ceded to Czechoslovakia after World War I. On October 15, 1924, he married Countess L√≠via Ser√©nyi. They had two children, J√°nos and Alice. Political career = Czechoslovak republic =  Domestic policy  The political policy of J√°nos Esterh√°zy was first based upon Christian-Nationalist ideas, which later became influenced by his relations with those who held more developed liberal positions. In the 1920s, he became a member of Provincial Christian-Socialist Party (Orsz√°gos Kereszt√©nyiszocialista P√°rt; OKszP). In 1931, he became the leader of the Hungarian League of Nations League in the Czechoslovak Republic, an organization which operated within the League of Nations. On December 11, 1932, he became a chairman of OKszP. He won a parliament mandate in Ko≈°ice at the elections in 1935 and was a deputy for that constituency in the Czechoslovak Parliament until 1938. In his first speech in parliament, he said: \\"As we have been attached to Czechoslovakia against our will, we demand that the Czechoslovak government fully respect our minority, language, cultural and economic rights.\\" The policy of both Hungarian opposition parties (Provincial Christian-Socialist Party and Hungarian National Party) was politically influenced and directed from Budapest. Esterh√°zy's political ideas were influenced by contemporary irredentism and aspirations to restore Hungary to her pre Treaty of Trianon borders. Esterh√°zy maintained close contact with Hungarian government by means of visits in Budapest, through diplomatic channels via the Hungarian Embassy in Prague, and through the Hungarian Consulate in Bratislava. This contact included written reports for the Hungarian government for which he used pseudonyms such as \\"Tam√°s\\", \\"Maty√°s\\" and number 221. These reports covered not only issues of ethnic minority policy, but also information about the internal political situations, concepts and strategies for weakening Czechoslovakia, and the politics of other countries against Czechoslovakia. From 1933, Hungary coordinated actions against Czechoslovakia with Nazi Germany. In June 1933, the Hungarian prime minister Gyula G√∂mb√∂s visited Germany and together with Adolf Hitler concluded that Czechoslovakia was the main obstacle for \\"rearrangement\\" of central Europe; that the Czechoslovak Republic should be internally dismantled, isolated internationally, and then eliminated by military power. Hungary requested not only the only alteration of borders, but \\"justice on historical principle\\". In August 1936, Mikl√≥s Horthy negotiated with Adolf Hitler and form this emerged the idea of a common attack against Czechoslovakia to \\"remove (the) cancer tumor from the heart of Europe\\". Hungary supported the idea of a Slovak autonomist movement which was seen as a tool for weakening the State and facilitating the potential disintegration of Czechoslovakia. Successive Hungarian governments tried to influence the autonomists and to win them over to a pro-Hungarian re-orientation, but in this they were not successful in the long term. Esterh√°zy also supported idea of Slovak autonomy and played the role of a mediator between the Hungarian government and Slovak People's Party (HSƒΩS). Before the elections of 1935, he tried to form an autonomist block with HSƒΩS. The Hungarian government intended to provide him 100,000 crowns for this purpose, but in the event failed so to do at last moment. Later, as an executive chairman of United Hungarian Party he asked for financial support to offer financial inducements to leading politicians of HSƒΩS. After negotiations with HSƒΩS in spring 1938 he described his goals, in a report to the Hungarian government, as an \\"overriding obligation of Hungarians to break (the) republic with the help of others\\". In 1935, the Hungarian MPs supported the successful bid of Edvard Bene≈° for the office of President of the Czechoslovak Republic. Edvard Bene≈° promised concessions to the Hungarian minority.Similarly, this election was supported also by the Slovak Peoples' Party. The votes of these parties proved unnecessary as, in the end, Bohumil Nƒõmec withdrew his candidacy before the election. He accepted funding from the Office of President to support Hungarian students and \\"against Hungarian irredentism\\". The office of President Bene≈° paid this in four instalments; the total amount 144,000 crowns. This was a part to his attempt to gain the favour of a younger generation within OKszP. In 1936, Bene≈° proposed to Esterh√°zy political cooperation with government and offered him a position as a government Minister-without-Portfolio, but Esterh√°zy did not accept. After urging on the part of the Hungarian government the Hungarian opposition parties united and founded the United Hungarian Party (Egyes√ºlt Magyar P√°rt; EMP) at their congress held in Nov√© Z√°mky on June 21, 1936. This new party was headed by Andor Jaross (executed later in Hungary as a war criminal) and Esterh√°zy become executive leader. The unification of the parties was not perceived positively, however, by all members and Esterh√°zy asked Hungarian government for a donation 15,000 crowns to \\"disarm the infringers of the order\\". During police questioning in 1945, he quantified the yearly support received from the Hungarian government as having amounted to 2,500,000 crowns annually. The allocation of such funding was decided by himself. The programme of the new party emphasized the autonomy of Slovakia. In 1936, representatives of the United Hungarian Party considered fusion with Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei, SdP). as negotiated by the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs K√°lm√°n K√°nya with German government circles in Berlin. On April 15, 1937, cooperation between both parties was agreed. On November 30, 1937, Esterh√°zy and Jaros were delegated to negotiate with SdP about issues of German minority in Slovakia. In the summer of 1937, Esterh√°zy disclosed intelligence relating to the Czechoslovak Army and informed the Hungarian government about the building of military fortresses and the related budget. In the autumn of the same year he wrote a report on defense projects near Luƒçenec and the Ipeƒæ river. 1938 saw the new party receive a majority of the votes cast by ethnic Hungarians. Now was the time when the party made clear their declared request to join ethnic these Hungarian territories to The Kingdom of Hungary.  Critical year 1938  In 1938, Esterh√°zy participated in several negotiations in the capitals of the states primarily determined upon the weakening and ultimate elimination of Czechoslovakia (Berlin, Budapest, Warszawa, Rome), where he acted as a semi-official mediator for the Hungarian government. During Hitler's visit to Italy in May 1938, he was notably invited to an intimate lunch with the F√ºhrer. In May 1938, he informed the Hungarian government of Nazi's plans with regards to Czechoslovakia, which information he had obtained from the leader of the Sudeten German Party, Konrad Henlein. According to his report Czech lands would to be occupied by Germany and Slovakia should be re-joined to Hungary. On the other hand, he (as a member of parliament who had taken the parliamentary oath) did not inform the Czechoslovak authorities. In June 1938, he negotiated with some Polish representatives and asked them to use their influence with Slovak politicians from autonomist movement to adopt the Hungarian solution to the Slovak question (annexation of Slovakia by Hungary). Esterh√°zy was aware that this idea is extremely unpopular in Slovakia because of previous Hungarian policy. Poland as a Slavic and Catholic state might play the helpful role of referee during the communications with the pro-Polish wing of HSƒΩS. Slovakia was to receive a similar status as Croatia had enjoyed in Austria-Hungary. This proposal presented more of his own ideas than the official attitude of the Hungarian government. Poland, which also had an interest in the breakup of Czechoslovakia, was willing to provide guarantees but the Hungarian government decided to maintain a waiting position and did not initialise the first steps expected by Poland. Moreover, such an idea was strictly rejected by the leader of Slovak pro-Polish wing of HSƒΩS Karol Sidor who declared: \\"We do not trust Hungarians and there cannot be a single word about a return to them\\". This statement was published in both the Polish and Slovak press. According to Esterh√°zy's concept Slovakia was to receive autonomy within Hungary following upon its territorial division. After the occupation of Carpathian Ruthenia the eastern border should be adjusted to the west, to as great a degree as possible, and the southern part separated. He was informed about plan of Sudeten Germans to sabotage negotiations with Czechoslovak government. He discussed this situation with Hungarian government and received instructions to work out on such program which could not be fulfilled. Contrary to Sudeten Germans, he refused excessive radicalization to prevent unnecessary bloodbath. In 1938 he met the head of the British mission, Lord Runciman several times, and to whom he prepared a memorandum on the position of the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia. Esterh√°zy welcomed the Munich Agreement and together with a pro-Hungarian deputy of HSƒΩS, J. Janƒçek, he immediately traveled to Budapest in order to prepare the ground for a rejoining of Slovakia and Hungary. He also wanted to take part in the negotiations about the two countries' borders in Kom√°rno, but the head of the Czechoslovakian delegation, Jozef Tiso, rejected his request. After the failure of bilateral negotiations in Kom√°rno during the course of which Hungary refused several Slovak proposals (autonomy for Hungarians in Slovakia, cession of Great Rye Island, balanced minorities in both countries), Ester√°zy participated in preparation of the First Vienna Award (currently null and void as an act of international violence). The arbitration was mediated under leadership of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy; Esterh√°zy having been sent to Rome during the preparation phase by Hungarian government as an expert on Slovak-Hungarian border. In this capacity he contributed to annexation of Ko≈°ice by Hungary. The Italian government was informed of his participation directly by the Hungarian minister of foreign affairs, who also gave Esterh√°zy instructions concerning the territorial demands of Hungary and the other potential participants. On November 11, 1938, in his capacity as the MP of Ko≈°ice (then Kassa) he welcomed the Hungarian Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy. In his speech, he asked for the same rights for Slovaks in the annexed territory as were expected for Hungarians in Slovakia. Admiral Horthy welcomed Slovaks in their \\"thousand year old homeland\\" and promised to respect their national and cultural rights. Contrary to speeches of both politicians, Hungary immediately started persecution of the non-Hungarian population in the annexed territory. Minority rights were reduced to below the standard enjoyed under democratic Czechoslovakia; rights which had been criticized as inadequate by Esterh√°zy in previous years. Esterh√°zy's property remained on non-annexed part of Slovakia. According to his words he stayed there to defend the interests of the ethnic Hungarians. Due to violation of the ethnic principle, which was previously emphasized by Hungary as a \\"correction of injustices of Trianon\\", the size of Hungarian minority shrank to about 67,000 people. Esterh√°zy was surprised by the behaviour of the Hungarian state authorities in the annexed territory - behaviour which was very much opposed to his own political principles. He tried to achieve voluntary return of Slovaks to Kingdom of Hungary, but the Slovak public reacted very sensitively to the persecution of Slovaks in Hungary. He believed that this rough-handed form of assimilation made their return to Hungary much more difficult. Following a bloodbath in the occupied village ≈†urany he intervened in Budapest strongly declaring that such brutality damaged Hungarian cause and made his and the Hungarian position in Slovakia untenable. However, he refused to distance himself from Hungarian policy publicly, fearing that such action might damage the interests of Hungary. For similar reasons he criticized negotiations in Kom√°rno before the First Vienna Award. According to his point of view, excessive territorial demands damaged Hungary as they furnished a strong dissuasive to Slovaks to entertain an Hungarian re-orientation. After the Munich Agreement the situation in Slovakia became radicalized and the democratic system collapsed. Beside HSƒΩS, only the German Party and Esterh√°zy's United Hungarian Party remained legal. In rigged elections in November 1938, HSƒΩS placed Esterh√°zy in an attractive 17th place on \\"common list of candidates\\" and he thus became a member of new Slovak Assembly. In December 1938, he visited Poland again. According to memoir of Polish diplomatic corps and politician, Jan Szembek, Esterh√°zy judged the results of the First Vienna Award as insufficient. He complained also of the failure with regard to a planned action against Trans- Carpathian Ruthenia (still part of Czechoslovakia), which was subsequently attacked on 20 November 1938 by terrorist groups of Polish and Hungarian voluntaries (they performed several diversion actions against Czechoslovakia with the goal of her destabilization). Esterh√°zy declared that it necessary to prepare new \\"energic decisions\\" and promised his personal engagement in regard to Carpathian Ruthenia and in favour of Hungary. He also noted that such actions would be secured by his parliamentary immunity. On 23 January 1939, the autonomous Slovak government created a commission which was to propose the first anti-Jewish laws. On 26 January, Esterh√°zy advised Hungarian government to adopt anti-Jewish law faster or in more radical form than Slovakia. This, he believed, would strengthen the position of Hungary in support of her claim to Slovakia after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia. In his report he expressed the wish that \\"thus we can hopefully achieve that Berlin will turn away from them completely and we will benefit if Berlin decides to solve Czechoslovak issue definitely\\". He published a daily, √öj H√≠rek (fresh news) in Bratislava, but it was banned and Esterh√°zy fell under police surveillance. Later he established a new daily, the Magyar H√≠rlap (Hungarian newspaper) in which he urged the necessity for land reform in the annexed territory. = Slovak Republic (1939-1945) =  Activities in the Assembly  The First Slovak Republic was founded as a secondary product of Nazi aggression against Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939. Esterh√°zy tried to persuade Nazis that Slovaks are for unity with Hungary during his visit in Berlin in February 1939, but he officially welcomed the establishment of \\"independent\\" Slovakia in a radio speech. He presented creation of the new state as a liberation from \\"Czech slavery\\" or from \\"Czech yoke\\" as he did on the first anniversary. Shortly after breakup of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia was attacked by Hungary without declaration of war. Head of Hungarian military intelligence Rezs≈ë Andorka states in his memoir that he met with Esterh√°zy day before Hungarian attack and Esterh√°zy expressed great enthusiasm to this idea. Esterh√°zy was a member of the assembly transportation-technical committee which did not discuss laws of higher political importance. His political activities were driven by pragmatic interests and were politically inconsistent. He helped to create anti-democratic and totalitarian regime, but he expected that the same regime will behave in humanistic and tolerant way. He positively evaluated role of pro-fascist Hlinka Guard, but criticized its violence and emerging labor and internment camps. Among other anti-democratic laws, he appreciated restriction of press freedom and the censorship in November 1939. He involved himself in discussions who is more loyal and who better serves Nazi Germany among German satellites. He disputed with strongly pro-nazi newspapers accusing Hungary to be unreliable ally. According to his opinion, Hungary had irreplaceable role in the \\"creation of new European order\\" because of deep roots of German-Hungarian friendship and stood close to Axis states in their \\"giant struggle for better future of Europe\\". Similarly, he reasoned orientation on Germany and Italy for Hungarian prime minister. He also returned to his political activities in mid-war Czechoslovakia. Hungarian politicians who collaborated with Czechoslovak governments were marked by him as traitors and he confirmed that he will not perform \\"such activities as against Czechoslovakia\\". As he stated, Czechoslovakia was understood by him as a state without any right for existence and he wished to break it already as a deputy of Czechoslovak parliament. In Bratislava, he founded a publishing company and backed the operations of SzEMKE, an ethnic Hungarian cultural organization that had been banned but restarted in 1942.  Minority rights  Esterh√°zy was the sole deputy in the Slovak Assembly representing the Hungarian minority. His speeches were focused mainly on problems of Hungarian minority rights and Slovak-Hungarian relationships. All of his 19 parliament speeches were held in Hungarian language, in accordance with rules of procedure of the Slovak National Assembly. His nomination was understood as an accommodating step in accordance with the declared principle of reciprocity. Slovakia expected that Hungary will proceed the same way for Slovaks. He accepted nomination on government list of candidates as an expression of officially sympathies for Slovak emancipation compliant with his strategic goals. Authoritative Slovak regime applied principle of reciprocity as the only one effective tool to prevent persecution of Slovaks on territory occupied by Hungary. The principle was included in new Slovak Constitution and it bound minority rights of Hungarians in Slovakia to rights of Slovaks in Hungary. Esterh√°zy represented minority which played role of hostages with risk that situation will proceed with extreme. Also for the sake of Hungarian community in Slovakia, he tried to enforce minority rights for Slovaks in Hungary already in November 1938, but he did not succeed. Slovak government had also tried to create offices of state secretaries for minorities where Esterh√°zy should represent Hungarian minority, but it was not successful because of unwillingness of Hungarian government. He personally intervened for permission of Saint Adalbert Association (Spolok sv√§t√©ho Vojtecha, Slovak catholic and cultural association) in Hungary what was condition of Slovak government to allow Hungarian cultural association (Szlovensk√≥zi Magyar Kulturegyesulet - SzEMKE). In 1940, the United Hungarian Party was renamed to the Hungarian Party in Slovakia (Szlovensk√≥i Magyar P√°rt). Due to the principle of reciprocity, his party was officially registered only in 1941 when Hungarian government had officially permitted the activities of the Party of Slovak National Unity.The principle which allowed to refuse registration of minority party if Slovaks do not have similar right in opposite country was included to constitution on July 27, 1941. Esterh√°zy requested help of Hungarian minister of foreign affairs Cs√°ky to persuade Teleki already in December 1940. Teleki refused Slovak delegation in February 1941. On March 1, 1941, Slovaks in Hungary published memorandum demanding permission of Slovak party. Esterh√°zy supported and urged their requests in Hungarian government, which was not successful yet. On July 10, 1941, he delivered memorandum about injustices against Hungarians in Slovakia to Slovak prime minister Vojtech Tuka asking also for permission of Hungarian party in Slovakia. Shortly after (July 15, 1941) Emanuel B√∂hm (leader of Slovaks in Hungary) addressed memorandum similar by content and form to Hungarian prime minister as a reaction. B√∂hm and Esterh√°zy met on informal meeting in Budapest and they exchanged both memorandums.Emanuel B√∂hm notes in his memories that Esterh√°zy was astonished by content and after clarification he promised to intervene. In the evening of the same day he called to B√∂hm that L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy is expecting request for registration of Slovak party and positively inclines to deal. Repetition of all Esterhazy's steps (submissions, newspaper articles, appeals, etc.) was then used by Slovaks in Hungary as a new tactic. Vojtech Tuka and L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy agreed on reciprocal registration of minority parties at the end of 1941 after German intervention. In October 1942, Esterh√°zy held speech on presidency of Hungarian United Party and asked for improvement of situation of Hungarian minority. He also addressed additional memorandum to Slovak government. This Esterh√°zy's speech was again translated and paraphrased by B√∂hm. B√∂hm tried to publish it as demands of Slovak minority in newspaper Slovensk√° jednota, however article was banned by Hungarian censorship.  Involvement in the anti-semitic policy  Esterh√°zy as a member of Slovak Diet voted for several anti-democratic laws including antisemitic laws leading to Jewish tragedy. He did not only agreed with the measures against Jews but also supported them actively by his presentations. In his parliamentary speeches, he repeatedly declared support for antisemitic policy of government. On 28 November 1939, when he discussed Hungarian minority rights, he commented also the first trials for \\"aryanisation\\" of Jewish property. He did not criticize fact that government nominated commissars to manage Jewish companies but the low number of Hungarians who were allowed to participate. He also declared that three such commissars were nominated thanks to his repeated intervention. In the spring 1940, the assembly discussed the first \\"Aryanization\\" law. The law was finally adopted on April 25, 1940, in Esterh√°zy's presence and without any objections or amendments to the text from his side. The law restricted foundation of new companies by Jews, restricted ability to dispose with their own property and allowed to close their companies or to sell it to \\"qualified Christian prospects\\". In June 1940, Germany ordered changes in the Slovak government which strengthen position of radicals and accelerated solution of the \\"Jewish issue\\". On September 3, 1940, Esterh√°zy voted for the constitutional act which entitled the government to \\"take every measures necessary for the exclusion of the Jews from the Slovak economic and social life and to transfer the property of the Jews into the ownership of the Christians\\". Shortly after adoption of this law, several antisemitic regulations were issued during the same month. Jews lost right to drive motor vehicles, they had handed over passports (lost last chance to emigrate) and the government created central organization for all Jews (√östred≈àa ≈Ωidov). Until September 16, Jews had to deliver inventory of their property. Also in this situation, Ester√°zy publicly agreed with government antisemitic policy and attacked Jews in the assembly. In his speech from October 8, 1940, he welcomed special categorization of Jews during incoming cenzus and declared that \\"Hungarian salesmen over decades and centuries were suffering as much from Jews and Jewish frauds as the Slovak were\\". On the other hand, he protested against harming Hungarians under the cover of \\"the legitimate fight against Jews\\". He also positively evaluated \\"real and fast measures\\" against Jews to retire them from the economic life.  Deportation law  Social and economic exclusion of Jews, demonstrably supported and agreed by Esterh√°zy in the Assembly, led to the creation of large socially dependent group whose members lost their jobs and property. This degraded the Jewish community to undesirable \\"social burden\\" and the government found a \\"solution\\" in deportation of Jews outside the country's borders. Esterh√°zy's views on anti-semitic policy presented in the Assembly did not oppose official policy of the state until May 15, 1942. In this time, most of the Jewish population was already deported and the assembly discussed so called \\"deportation law\\". Events associated with this law are frequently misinterpreted and Esterh√°zy is incorrectly presented as the only one who disagreed with deportations or the only one who voted against the law. The adoption of the law did not start the deportation process what is usually ignored and not mentioned by Esterh√°zy admirers and it is considered to be controvert (not exclusively negative or positive) step by historians dealing with holocaust in Slovak Republic (1939‚Äì45). The assembly refused to legalize deportations already in March (when the deportations began) despite strong pressure of radicals. After unsuccessful trials to stop deportations and failure of negotiation with pro-Nazi prime minister Vojtech Tuka, the chairman of the assembly Martin Sokol concluded with some other deputies that existence or non-existence of the official law has a none impact on the fact that Jews are deported, but its adoption can save part of them. The law retroactively legalized existing deportations but defined legal frame to protect certain groups. The exact process of voting can be nowadays hardly reconstructed. Esterh√°zy did not vote against, but unofficially abstained (the voting process did not allow abstain officially or to vote against). A group of deputies left the assembly hall on a protest before voting, beside several Slovak deputies also German deputy for Deutsche Partei Jozef Steinh√ºbel. Another group proposed to extend the list of protected people also for parents of Jews who will receive exceptions. Esterh√°zy did not propose any change request, did not hold any speech and during voting he simply did not raise his hand. His gesture became known because of articles in pro-fascist press who attacked him immediately. However, the press intentionally concealed all mentions about other deputies, what was observed already in that time also by the Nazi intelligence agency.Von der Presse wurde nat√ºrlich nicht ver√∂ffentlicht, dass sich auch einige Geistliche bei der Abstimmung von der Abgabe ihrer Stimmen zur√ºckhielten. Thanks to these events Esterh√°zy become the only one among the members present for whom it was obvious that he did not vote and the only one who did it in a public and demonstrative way. This positive gesture came relatively late. Only cca 15.000 out of 57,628 Jews deported in 1942 were deported after adoption of the law. Esterh√°zy did not wish to declare his opinion publicly, but he did it in private conversation with Martin Sokol before voting. Later, he explained his reasons also in the letter for the Hungarian government. He declared that the law is bad and not human, but he also confirmed his antisemitic orientation \\"from early childhood\\" and expressed his will to remain antisemitic. He reasoned his motivation also by the fact that he as a minority politician cannot vote for a law which grants majority right to deport minority. The case of deportation was one of his last active steps in the Assembly. From the second half of 1942, he moved to more passive and alibistic position. This was the same or similar process which could be observed also for many members of ruling party.  Help to persecuted people  Esterh√°zy preserved his contacts with Poles from interwar period. During the war, the Slovak-Hungarian border became a territory with high importance for the Polish resistance movement. Most of courier and traffickers lines between occupied Poland and Hungary passed through southern Slovakia. This channel was used to preserve connection between home resistance and exile leaders. Poles were in contact with several pro-Polish deputies of Slovak's People Party represented by Pavol ƒåarnogursk√Ω who acted as contact person to cross Hungarian border as well as with J√°nos Esterh√°zy. Esterh√°zy used his parliamentary immunity to transfer Poles in his car and he also intervened to help captured Poles who were issued to Germans. According to Janek, Esterh√°zy secretly arranged visas and passports for Jews. The Hungarian government disagreed with his operations therefore L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy prohibited him from saving Jewish people and others, however he continued in his actions. He states that he saved the lives of many Jews, Slovaks, Czechs and Poles..  Loss of immunity and end of the war  Esterh√°zy together with the leader of Carpathian Germans Franz Karamasin led in number of request for prosecution and cancellation of parliamentary immunity. Most of cases were related to violation of traffic rules and prosecution was not approved by assembly. The only one exception was incident in train station in Poprad on October 22, 1943.When elite train of railways (Tatransk√Ω expres) got broken, it was replaced by regular train. According to police sources, disenchanted Esterh√°zy screamed about six times that \\"this is fake as everything in this state\\". This was evaluated as especially incendiary by attendees, because it was said by well-known public official in authoritative state. Immunity committee then recommended to allow permission for prosecution, what was agreed unanimously with massive applause of other deputies. After loss of immunity, he spoke in the assembly only twice ‚Äì in debate about state budget for 1944 and in debate about law of defense of state in February 1944. Since 1943, his political activity declined in the context of internal political changes and turnover in the war. In October 1944, he protested against occupation of Hungary by German army. When the fascist Arrow Cross Party came to power, he was asked to transform his party to its local branch but refused. The Arrow Cross Party regime interned him for a short time and the German Gestapo subsequently declared him wanted.B√©la K. Kir√°ly, Gunther Erich Rothenberg, War and Society in East Central Europe: Czechoslovak policy and the Hungarian minority, 1945-1948, Brooklyn College Press : distributed by Columbia University Press, 1982, p. 200 He hid before German as well as before Czechoslovak authorities until the Soviet troops arrived. =Prison and death= After liberation of Slovakia, he started to restore activities of Hungarian party. He criticized post-war persecutions of Hungarian minority, liquidation of the Hungarian occupation regime in southern Slovakia and participated on memorandum against The Government Program of Ko≈°ice. He was arrested by Czechoslovak bodies and investigated for his activities. He had to be judged on The Slovak National Court as all members of the Slovak Assembly, but he was illegally deported by Soviet Army in summer 1945. Esterh√°zy was kept for one year in the feared prison of Lubyanka in Moscow, and then, on the basis of fabricated allegations, he was sentenced to ten years work in Siberia. In the meantime, The Slovak National Court in Bratislava on September 16, 1947, sentenced him in his absence to death for breaking up the Czechoslovak state, collaboration with the fascist regime and for his participation as a deputy of the Slovak Assembly. In 1949 the Soviet Union extradited him to Czechoslovakia. Esterh√°zy was already seriously ill in that time. He was not executed as a presidential pardon commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. Over the next years he was transferred from prison to prison in Czechoslovakia. He died in M√≠rov prison hospital in 1957 on March 8, 6 days before his 56th birthday. Efforts for his rehabilitation On January 21, 1993 the Russian justice system rehabilitated J√°nos Esterh√°zy after evaluation that his deportation into the USSR, passing a sentence and imprisonment was unlawful. Materials on the rehabilitation were passed to Hungarian Government even if he was not a citizen of Hungary during his political career. His daughter, Alice Esterh√°zy-Malfatti, ethnic Hungarian politicians in Slovakia and politicians in Hungary, have been trying to achieve the rehabilitation in Slovakia of J√°nos Esterh√°zy since November 1989, supported by the Hungarian government. The effort has not been successful so far. In 1993 the appeal to the Town Court of Bratislava was raised to permit re-opening trial of J√°nos Esterh√°zy with the goal to achieve the statement of innocence. A year later, proceedings took place to decide if reopening of trial is justified and based on new facts which can bring new aspects to original lawsuit. The Town Court performed extensive evidence including examination of witnesses in Bratislava and Budapest. The court also requested for expert opinions from the Historical Institute the Slovak Academy of Sciences, from several historical institutions from Hungary, from historian with dealing the history of the Hungarians in Slovakia and two Czech historians. In 1994, the initiator changed original appeal and withdrew the issue of reopening. Through her attorney she addressed the General Prosecution to cancel the original sentence due to infringement of the rights of accused. The European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg refused her complaint against legality of original trial because its competency towards Slovakia starts only on March 18, 1992. There is a letter from Simon Wiesenthal to Dr. Peter Samko, chief judge of the Town Court of Bratislava, published in the newspaper of √öj Sz√≥, 1993.√öj Sz√≥ Daily, May 5, 1993 In his letter Wiesenthal strongly defends Esterh√°zy and offers witnesses on his behalf (√öj Sz√≥ Daily also published: on the testimonial of the Schlesinger family of Pozsony, saved by Esterh√°zy).√öj Sz√≥ Daily, June 6, 1993 The American Hungarian Federation has also worked to exonerate Esterh√°zy and has published the Wiesenthal letter along with additional letters from Yad Veshem and historians √Åd√°m Magda and Istvan Deak, Seth Lowe Professor Emeritus from Columbia University's Department of History (Deak's statements related to the supposed standpoints of the modern Slovak and Czech republics contradicts several official documents and declarations).Istvan Deak claims in his letter that \\"virtually no Czech and Slovak statesman has apologized for the highly efficient 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' in the two states\\" and \\"blaming J√°nos Esterh√°zy will not solve the Slovak historical dilemma\\". However, the Slovak National Council and the Slovak Government published common declaration related to this topic already on December 20, 1990 (13 years before his letter) during the same year as the first democratic elections occurred after collapse of communism. (Declaration of The Slovak National Council and Government of the Slovak Republic about deportation of Jews). \\"Non existing\\" (according to Istvan Deak) apologize for expulsion of German minority was approved by The Slovak National Council on February 12, 1991. (Declaration of The Slovak National Council about expulsion of Germans). On the Czech side, this topic is covered by Article No. III of the Czech-German declaration about mutual relationships and their future development (Czech-German declaration about mutual relationships and their future development) Istvan Deak criticizes that Esterhazy was \\"sentenced by the Czechoslovak court for having endangered the existence of Czechoslovakia, but between 1939 and 1945 there was no Czechoslovakia\\". On the contrary, Retribution Act No. 33/1945 Col. of Slovak National Council explicitly contains declaration that crimes are not bound to period referenced by Istvan Deak (¬ß1 a), ¬ß2 a) and b)). In 2012, the World Federation of Hungarians tried to rehabilitate Esterh√°zy in the Czech Republic through a petition that was delivered to the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. Committee on Petitions dealt with the petition, but rejected it on the grounds that judicial rehabilitation by Czech courts is not possible, because he was tried by the National Court in Bratislava and there is not enough materials for other type of rehabilitation.  Historical interpretations  J√°nos Esterh√°zy belongs to the most typical examples of different views and interpretations of personalities in the common Slovak and Hungarian history. Hungarian and Slovak historians did not achieved compliance in their experted opinions requested by court during trial for reopening his case. = Mainstream Hungarian and Polish histography = The collective of Hungarian historians declared that prosecution of Esterh√°zy was unfounded. Provincial Christian-Socialist Party and Hungarian United Party were national-conservative parties and they had not Nazi orientation. Hungarian Party founded by Esterh√°zy during the first Slovak republic was \\"even more anti-Nazi and had everyday antifascist practice\\" within which it supported persecuted people. It was only hardly tolerated organization which is proven by its late registration in 1942. Esterh√°zy had objections against revisionism of Hungarian governments and he had tried to apply Hungarian minority within Czechoslovakia until 1938. During crisis in 1938, he did everything to prevent violent actions. Esterh√°zy supported Slovak autonomism and he constantly worked in favor of Hungarian-Slovak friendship and cooperation. Usage of cover names was evaluated as a common diplomatic practice. According to their opinion, nobody has ever found any document which authorizes whoever to accuse Esterh√°zy of intelligence activities or to indicate it. Because of these reasons, they characterized accusations related to breakage of Czechoslovakia and collaboration with fascism as unfounded. Hungarian historian Istv√°n Janek sees the reason of his death in his \\"fight for European values, human and minority right and mutual tolerance among nations\\". According to his opinion, he was sentenced in absence to prevent presence of unwanted witnesses during his trial and real reason of his conviction was to intimidate the Hungarian minority. Esterh√°zy was arrested and handed over to the Soviet secret service on the order of Gust√°v Hus√°k. Esterh√°zy as a west-oriented politician kept his distance from Berlin and from Moscow and also because of that he did not become fascist. His antisemitism is also questioned and antisemitic statements are explained as \\"expected by those who held power\\". Esterh√°zy is presented as a humanist, democrat and politician who can be an example for cooperation between nations in the Central Europe. According to memoir of his sister Lujza and some modern Hungarian historians like Moln√°r or Janek, Esterh√°zy helped Slovak general Rudolf Viest (later leader of the Slovak National Uprising) to escape to London in 1939.Sources currently included in the article do not contain any details when and how this help was provided. Imre Moln√°r states that Esterh√°zy was not antisemitic as his publications did not contain antisemitic statements. Moln√°r denies Esterh√°zy's participation on approval of antisemitic laws. He states that Esterh√°zy did not vote for the first \\"aryanisation\\" law because he was not present during the assembly meeting. However, he does not mention that assembly voted about this law twice, because it was returned to the assembly by president Jozef Tiso. Esterh√°zy's absence applied only to the first voting and during the second voting he was present. According to Moln√°r, Esterh√°zy employed Jewish journalists at newspaper of Esti √öjs√°g as long as he could. He also declares that is not true that Esterhazy voted for laws against Jewish people because the \\"Jewish Codex\\" (Regulation 198/1941 about legal status of Jews) was accepted by the government and not by the assembly and the assembly voted only for supplement provisions in connection with the Codex. This theory is not supported by the fact that not all legal norms were issued by government. The assembly was not obliged to agree on the \\"Jewish Codex\\", because deputies (including Esterh√°zy) explicitly delegated responsibility to exclude Jews from social and economic life by the constitutional law. In the same support for Hungarian historical orthography of J√°nos Esterh√°zy, Polish historians and media also portray him positively, as Poles attributed him as the supporter for the Polish government-in-exile. Late Polish President, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, had a posthumous distinction to him, considering him as a sample of a national hero of both Hungary and Poland. In March 2015, Mr. Ciechanowski stressed that J√°nos Esterh√°zy was a Hungarian patriot and great friend of Poland and the Poles. He accentuated the fact that Francis Rakoczi and Esterh√°zy are among the most preeminent figures personifying the thousand- year-old tradition of Polish-Hungarian friendship and the joint struggle of both nations for honour and freedom.http://www.bip.udskior.gov.pl/J%C3%A1nos,Esterh%C3%A1zy,prize,for,the,Head,of,the,Office,for,War,Veterans,and,Victims,of,Oppression,1194.html = Mainstream Slovak and Czech histography = In contrast with Hungarian and Polish historians who highlight his national, Christian and humanistic values, Slovak and Czech historians came to conclusion that by some positive features of Christian-democratic politician, his activities against Czechoslovakia were unambiguously hostile. Czech historian Jaroslav Valenta noted that the goal of Esterh√°zy's negotiations in Poland was not improvement of situation of Hungarian minority represented by him, but realization of a Greater-Hungarian policy and attack against integrity and independence of Czechoslovakia. His role of minority politician was completely in the background and he voluntary acted as an emissary and mediator of Hungarian government. This kind of participation on negotiation of two states with the goal to divide or eliminate third country (more if he was citizen of this country) was evaluated by him as a clear treason of the state. Valenta points out that Esterh√°zy performed activities against existence of Czechoslovakia also in time when he voluntary decided for Czechoslovak citizenship. He finds very unusual Esterh√°zy's interpretation of parliamentary immunity as a tool for preparation of aggression against the state which provides him this privilege. Valenta questioned method used by Hungarian historians to prove Esterh√°zy's loyalty for the purpose of reopening of his case. According to him, the same method can be used also to prove loyalty of leader of Sudeten Germans Konrad Henlein. Regarding to their theory about lack of documents confirming his activities against Czechoslovakia, he noted that they did not bother to study documentation from Polish sources which are available for years. Slovak historian Ivan Kamenec interprets Esterh√°zy's role both as a creator and a victim of totality regime which was built with his support. Esterh√°zy had to decide between democratic Czechoslovakia with her shortcomings and the national principle. He decided for the second way which was already directed by Nazi Germany and paid high personal and political price for his decision. Fact that Esterh√°zy was not a Nazi did not prevent his collaboration with Nazis in the real world policy. His tragic life is not a reason to ignore critical views. Another Slovak historian Ladislav De√°k points out that Esterh√°zy supported idea of Slovak autonomy only as a preliminary step for her later incorporation to Hungary. He criticizes tendencies to misinterpret his political activities and trials to understand him exclusively as a Hungarian patriot, defender of justified rights of Hungarians, humanist and martyr. According to De√°k, Esterh√°zy's political views goes beyond this line and are clear from his documents addressed to Hungarian politicians and the government. As other Slovak authors, he reminds his anti-democratic and anti- Semitic activities, but positively evaluates his moral gesture during voting about deportation law. However, this moral gesture came too late and could not change anything about tragic fate of Slovak Jews. Ferdinand Vr√°bel does not speak only about ignorance of historical documents proving Esterh√°zy's anti- state activities by Hungarian historians, but he openly speaks about lies. According to his opinion, providing of intelligence information or Esterh√°zy's participation on negotiations in Rome before the First Vienna Award is far from standard diplomatic practice. He criticizes work of Imre Moln√°r as something which ignores current knowledge in the several fields and he sees conflict of interest between Moln√°r's position of chairman of society which has goal to rehabilitate Esterh√°zy and his scientific work. Theories and interpretations of Imre Moln√°r are criticized as naive, e.g. theory that he came to negotiations in Rome as a \\"private person\\" on fighter plane provided by unspecified government. As he noted, \\"false accusation\\" about Esterh√°zy's participation on adoption of anti-Semitic laws are not confirmed only by Slovak historians, but also by historians of other nationalities and representatives of Slovak Jews. Research of the Holocaust in Slovakia did not confirm Esterh√°zy's unique role on rescue of Jews. Slovak historiography recognizes that almost all members of the ruling elite had they \\"own\\" Jews under protection. Except help for particular people (i.e. lessees of his property) and open possibity to discover new documents, massive Esterh√°zy's help for Jews is considered to be poorly documented and unreliable theory. During the war, Slovak Jews formed illegal organization Working Group and tried to rescue Slovak and other European Jews. This group organized also trafficking of Jews from Poland to Hungary, where Esterh√°zy could play positive role thanks to his contacts. However, known collections of documents do not contain any mention about his collaboration with this organization. His supposed help for general Rudolf Viest is not supported by Viest's biographies by Slovak and Czech authors and it is criticized as a factual mistake. This theory is also against own Viest's memoir written before he was captured by Germans and died probably in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. Theory about role of Gust√°v Hus√°k in his handing over to the Soviet service is criticized as based mostly on journalistic literature. Ladislav De√°k points that Soviet security authorities arbitrarily deported dozen thousands of Czechoslovaks and such situation was not something exceptional. The dossier on Ministry of foreign affairs shows that Slovak authorities and Ministry of foreign affairs wanted to ensure Esterh√°zy's presence during his trial. Confidential letter addressed to state secretary Vladim√≠r Clementis in the case of requesting him back from USSR from August 14, 1947 presents his imprisonment by Soviets as an action of Russian military patrol without participation of Czechoslovak authorities. More, photocopy of this document is published also by Imre Moln√°r. In Hus√°k's letter to Clementis from August 21, 1947, Hus√°k expressed opinion that \\"it would be good if Esterh√°zy is issued to our authorities\\". Esterh√°zy is sometimes referred to as a Hungarian agent or directly as a spy. His supposed objective was the revision of the Treaty of Trianon. According to Istv√°n Janek from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, such accusations are not supported by contemporary documents, due to the lack of official documents about his position and tasks. In \\"reaction on glorification\\" of J√°nos Esterh√°zy, Institute of History of Slovak Academy of Sciences published in 2011 a memorandum about his political profile, signed also by directors of other Slovak historical institutes. Among other, the memorandum declared that presenting him as a democrat, humanist and selfless savior of persecuted persons is in contrast with historical facts and his decision to not vote for deportation cannot be used as the only one and determining criterion for all his political activities. Instead of glorification and building memorials, they recommended rational discussion about his life and actions.  Political controversies  On his 100th birthday, Hungary's parliament held a memorial session in the presence of then president of the republic Ferenc M√°dl. On April 20, 2007, President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom also urged Esterh√°zy's rehabilitation. \\"How comes that everybody respect a \\"war criminal\\", politicians officially stand by him, while legally and in documents he is still burdened by the most severe possible condemnation?\\" \\\\- S√≥lyom said in a speech delivered at a conference organized by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to remember Esterh√°zy's death. This action of Hungarian parliament caused contradictory reactions in Slovakia, increased by attendance of politicians from Party of the Hungarian Coalition and Franti≈°ek Miklo≈°ko from Christian Democratic Movement. Other negative reactions came during placing his statues and busts in southern Slovakia. In 2011, such action led to conflict between organizers and some citizens in Ko≈°ice. In August 2011, newspaper of Slovak Union of Anti-Fasist Fighters interviewed president Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç about his views on national uprising and opinion to unveiling busts of contemporary politicians J√°nos Esterh√°zy and Ferdidand ƒéurƒçansk√Ω. Ga≈°paroviƒç refused building busts of \\"politicians involved in misery of that time\\" as improper, labeling Esterh√°zy as follower (vyzn√°vaƒç) of Hitler and fascism. This raised sharp negative reactions in Hungary. According to Hungarian deputy prime minister Zsolt Semj√©n, Esterh√°zy always committed to the teachings of the Catholic Church and there is no coincidence that his beatification is being considered. Hungarian parliamentary party Politics Can Be Different declared that such words are not only offence of Hungarian minority but of whole Hungarian nation. Awards In 2009, the Polish president posthumously awarded him the Polonia Restituta Order for the rescue of Polish refugees and General Kazimierz Sosnkowski through territory of Hungary. Esterh√°zy's family and supporters tried to achieve the Righteous Among the Nations award for him, but their long term effort was unsuccessful. In 1991, Dr. Moshe Bejski, Chairman of the Commission for the Designation of the Righteous and confirmed reception of testimonies and documents for the rehabilitation of J√°nos Esterh√°zy and paid tribute to his work and life. Later, Yad Vashem refused his nomination after consideration of all available documentation, but expressed thanks for help to particular groups of persecuted people. The positive part of the acknowledgment was referenced by Anti-Defamation League which presented the Jan Karski Courage to Care Award to Esterhazy on November 3, 2011. The award was assigned despite active protests of Jewish community in Slovakia and without any consultation with local historical institute. On November 13, 2011 representatives of Jewish community in Slovakia protested against award in open letter addressed to director of Anti-Defamation League Abraham Foxman.Open letter of Jewish community in Slovakia Mr. Abraham H. Foxman, director of American ADL (Anti-Defamation League) about honor and celebration of J√°nos Esterh√°zy on November 3, 2011. Signatories: Igor Rintel, chairman of The Federation of the Jewish Communities in Slovakia; Juraj Alner, president of B'nai B'rith Tolerance; Tom√°≈° Te≈°≈°er, president of B'nai B'rith Concordia; Grigorij Mese≈ænikov, Foreign Affairs Network (FAN) Bratislava; Roman Gajdo≈°, Foreign Affairs Network (FAN) Ko≈°ice. They criticized that \\"despite they great effort\\" ADL refused to take into account opinion of community affected by contemporary persecutions and reminded his participation on creation of significant number of antidemocratic, totalitarian and antisemitic laws. They criticized several opinions stated during presentation of award as incorrect. They disagreed with argumentation that \\"Esterh√°zy as a catholic could not agree with Nazi ideology and collaborate with totality regime\\" and pointed that several Catholic priests were politicians in that time (including president Jozef Tiso) and making references to Christian principles was also typical for leaders of fascism in Slovakia. They alerted that almost all members of the ruling elite had they \\"own\\" Jews under protection, including president Tiso or the most radical antisemites.

American Trucking Associations, Inc., 531 U.S. 457 (2001), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in which the Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for regulating ozone and particulate matter was challenged by the American Trucking Association, along with other private companies and the states of Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.. The Supreme Court faced the issues of whether the statute had impermissibly delegated legislative power to the agency and whether the Administrator of the EPA, Christine Todd Whitman, could consider the costs of implementation in setting national ambient air quality standards.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 462. Background Section 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act instructed the EPA to set \\"ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria [documents of Section 108] and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.\\" The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had decided that the standard making procedure delegated by Congress to the EPA to set air quality was an unconstitutional delegation in contravention of Article I, Section I, of the US Constitution because the EPA had interpreted the statute to provide \\"no intelligible principle\\" to guide the agency's exercise of authority. It also found that the EPA could not consider the cost of implementing a national ambient air quality standard. Decision In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the Court of Appeals' decision.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 486. The Court affirmed that the text of Section 109(b) unambiguously barred cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process. The Court wrote, \\"Whether the statute delegates legislative power is a question for the courts, and an agency‚Äôs voluntary self-denial has no bearing upon the answer.‚ÄùWhitman, 531 U.S. at 473. The Court determined that the scope of discretion that Section 109(b)(1) allowed was well within the outer limits of nondelegation precedents.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 474. Consequently, the Court remanded the case for the Court of Appeals to reinterpret the statute that would avoid a delegation of legislative power.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 476. =Concurrences= Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurrence. He was not sure that the intelligible principle criterion served to prevent all cessions of legislative power.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 487 (Thomas, J., concurring). He believed that there are cases in which the principle itself is intelligible but the significance of the delegated decision is simply too great for the decision to be called anything other than legislative. He stated that he would be willing to reconsider the delegation precedents in the future to determine whether delegation jurisprudence has strayed too far from Founders' understanding of separation of powers. Justice John Paul Stevens also wrote a separate concurrence, which was joined by Justice Souter.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 487-490 (Stevens, J., concurring).

They were founded in 1998 by Tony Chu and Kerry Wong. Their first performance was in the Specialties Act division of the 1998 Pinnacle Fantasy Productions Talent Spokesmodel Showcase and continued to perform martial arts stage shows for several years. ZeroGravity is also known for their independent martial arts films and being the motion capture actors for The Matrix Online and Devil May Cry 3. History ZeroGravity began by performing martial arts stage shows at various cultural festivals, talent showcases, and import car shows. In 2000, they branched into the indie film genre by making short martial arts, action films. At this point, their focus began to shift more from stage shows to their film projects. Other early projects included stunt work in an indie martial arts film starring Ho Sung Pak titled Epoch of the Lotus. In 2001, Kerry Wong moved to Los Angeles and founded a new division of the stunt group named ZeroGravity South. At that time The original group was renamed ZeroGravity North. Shortly after, Kerry Wong established relationships with ACT, an action stunt training group in Los Angeles. Through this new relationship Reuben Langdon and other members of ACT joined ZeroGravity South. After the release of Title Pending 2 and Damn 3, the group began devoting their efforts to breaking into the film business as stunt performers. Several members have also done motion capture for some well known video games, like The Matrix Online and Devil May Cry 3. Some members even provided voice overs for characters in Devil May Cry 3, with Reuben Langdon returning as the voice of Dante in Devil May Cry 4. In addition, Langdon was featured in the tokusatsu B-Fighter Kabuto, as well as stunt work for Power Rangers. Lateef Crowder was also a villain in the 2005 Tony Jaa film, Tom-Yum -Goong. Other works include small bit parts (mostly martial arts or fighting oriented) in the TV series Monk and Entourage. Reuben Langdon and Aaron Toney are planned to be villains in the American TV series Kamen Rider Dragon Knight. The team was also featured on Animal Planet's Most Extreme. Independent films Their first film, Title Pending, featured no dialogue or sound effects but instead played music, much like silents films from the early 20th century. The films run from 10 to 20 minutes in length and had many lengthy fight sequences. They were distributed largely over the internet where they gained popularity. Other early films included a series called Damn, Kid Gusto vs The Matrix, and US vs HK. After producing their earlier films, the group began to release films less frequently but increased the production level by using higher-quality cameras, adding more dialogue and incorporating more plot elements than before. =Film chronology= *Title Pending - 2001 *Damn - 2001 *Damn 2 - 2001 *Kid Gusto vs The Matrix - 2001 *Damn 4 - 2001 *US vs HK (US versus Hong Kong) - 2001 *Title Pending 2 - 2002 *Damn 3 - 2003 *Cha Cha Chinaman - 2004 *Hero vs Alien - 2004 *Inmate 451 - 2006 *An Act of Revenge - 2008 *Yeah Sure Okay - 2009 Members ZeroGravity has had numerous members join since its inception.

It is found in the bathypelagic and mesopelagic zones of tropical and subtropical parts of the world's oceans at depths down to about . Description Adult female Haplophryne mollis are much larger than adult males, with a maximum length of , but is a more common length. As in other angler fish, the front dorsal fin is replaced by a lure (illicium or esca) that protrudes forward and over the mouth to attract prey, but in this species this just consists of a flap of skin and there is no \\"fishing rod\\". The fish has spine-like ornamentation above the eyes and at the corners of the jaws. The head is large and angular, with a very wide mouth armed with numerous small teeth in both jaws. The dorsal fin, which has no spines but consists of three soft rays, is set far back on the body; the anal fin also has three soft rays and the tail is rounded. Unlike most other deepsea anglerfish, H. mollis lacks pigmentation, and both sexes appear pallid and translucent, with the musculature and portions of the skeleton clearly showing through the skin. Free-living males only grow to about , and differ from the adult and juvenile females by the noticeable lack of a short, bubble-like esca and having comparatively small fins. Juvenile females lack the spinous ornamentation on the head. Distribution Because of the great depths at which this fish lives, it is seldom encountered by humans. In 2009 it was reported that 88 known female specimens had been observed. The type specimen was described by the German zoologist August Brauer in 1902 from the Indian Ocean. Another Indian Ocean specimen was a free-living male caught off Western Australia. Other specimens have been trawled from the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, between 55¬∞N and 40¬∞S. Further specimens have been found in the Pacific Ocean off eastern Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand, with isolated findings near Hawaii and in the Gulf of Panama. It is found in the bathypelagic and mesopelagic zones of tropical and subtropical parts of the world's oceans at depths down to about . Life cycle and ecology Male H. mollis are at first free-living, but when they have found a female they latch onto her with their teeth. In most anglerfish the point of attachment for the male is on the belly, close to the anus, but in H. mollis the attachment site can be anywhere on the head or body, and in one case, a male attached to the female's esca (lure). The males orient themselves in random directions, and there may be more than one male per female. A papilla, or conical fleshy protuberance, grows at the site of attachment which may assist the male to establish a good grip. The mouth of the male is partially blocked by the papilla, but an opening usually remains at either side which suffices for allowing a flow of water over the gills. As time passes, the male becomes fused to the female and their tissues combine. The male can be considered as a parasite of the female but only about 30% of mature females encountered have an attached male, so many females may never encounter a mate, and remain in a solitary, non-reproductive state for the duration of their lives.

Brenner Children's Hospital has its own Emergency Department, including the first Level I Pediatric Trauma Care unit in North Carolina. More than 4,500 children are admitted to Brenner Children's Hospital every year and more than 21,000 pediatric subspecialty visits occur at hospital-based outpatient clinics. Brenner Children's Hospital generally treats children from western North Carolina, as well as parts of Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee, although some come from further away for advanced care. In 2015, Brenner Children's Hospital was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's best children's hospitals. It is nationally ranked in Orthopedics (#48). History Brenner Children's Hospital opened in 1986 thanks to the generosity of the Brenner family, longtime members of the Winston-Salem community. It initially began when the family financed the Brenner Center for Adolescent Medicine in 1981, which was focused on developing a teaching program in adolescent medicine for students and pediatric residents, as well as a clinic at what was then North Carolina Baptist Hospital. At the time, it was the first such center in North Carolina and one of just 27 nationally. Members of the Brenner family continued to work with hospital officials through the 1980s to create and plan a major hospital devoted to children's medicine. Brenner Children's Hospital opened in 1986, and in 1989 moved into its own wing within the larger hospital. In April 2002, Brenner Children's opened the $132 million Ardmore Tower West. In addition to its 144 private rooms, Brenner Children's has six playrooms, an interactive video wall and a rooftop garden with playground equipment.

Imprenta y librer√≠a de Mayo, de C. Casavalle, p. 21 was an action fought on October 1, 1813 during the second Campaign of Upper Peru in the Argentine War of Independence, where the republican forces led by General Manuel Belgrano were defeated by a royalist army, led by Joaquin de la Pezuela. Second Upper Peru campaign After the Army of the North's victories during the Battles of Tucum√°n and Salta, the campaign against the royalists in Upper Peru was restarted upon the insistence of the government in Buenos Aires. Despite being ill with malaria and having to command a company of new conscripts with insufficient artillery, Belgrano accepted the commanding post. Belgrano's army was supported from Oruro province by Colonel Baltasar C√°rdenas and the 2,000 poorly organized natives under his command, and Colonel Cornelio Zelaya with forces from Cochabamba. Both colonels had orders to raise the aboriginal populations against the Spanish authorities. Knowing that the royalist army did not have enough mules to move its artillery and provisions, Belgrano planned to use a pincer movement to attack, confidently believing that Pezuela's lack of mobility would be a decisive factor. The battle At the end of September 1813, most of Belgrano's army arrived to the plain of Vilcapugio, a plateau surrounded by high mountains several miles north of Potos√≠. The royalist troops were encamped further west at Condo-Condo under the orders of Pazuela and Major Saturnino Castro, which allowed them to take by surprise and utterly defeat C√°rdenas' native troops at Ancacato, 23 km north of Belgrano's headquarters. Castro also obtained documents from C√°rdenas giving instructions to Belgrano. With these documents Pezuela was able to interrupt Belgrano's plans and began his advance on the mountains on 1 October, long before Zelaya's cavalry from Cochabamba could join the republican army at Vilcapugio. Belgrano's army veterans from the North contained the left flank and center column of the royalist army and forced them to back down to the point that Pezuela had in mind, by a moment, to send a message to the Viceroy of Peru intimating that the battle had been lost. His own left flank, however, remained in action and defeated Belgrano's right column. Had the Northern army continued to persist in pursuing the Spanish troops, victory would have been secured, but the arrival of the royalist cavalry commanded by Saturnino Castro made the rebels panic, causing them to disperse.El brigadier Pezuela y su segundo, Ram√≠rez, acudieron velozmente a contener la dispersi√≥n y reparar tama√±o desorden; pero como la reserva hab√≠a hu√≠do tambi√©n sin disparar un solo tiro, todos sus esfuerzos habr√≠an sido est√©riles si la Divina Providencia no protege a las armas de Espa√±a guiando a Castro al combate en tan cr√≠tico momento. Garc√≠a Camba, Andr√©s (1846). Memorias para la Historia de las armas espa√±olas en el Per√∫. Sociedad tipogr√°fica de Hortelano y compa√±ia, V. II, page 105. The royalist army reorganized itself and appropriated all of its artillery, continuously shelling the few soldiers left in Belgrano's encampment. As result of the battle, 350 rebels and some 200 royalists were killed. Aftermath Belgrano and Eustaquio D√≠az V√©lez had decided that V√©lez would march to the south to Potos√≠ to reunite with the dispersed troops, while Belgrano would gathered the remains of his army near the town of Macha, some 65 km to the east. D√≠az V√©lez took command over the troops in Potos√≠ after Vilcapugio with the rest of the army on the left flank of the enemy. At this point the troops reorganized themselves to pursue the Campaign of Alto Per√∫ according to the orders from the government of Buenos Aires.

The municipality comprises 40 villages and hamlets: Christofberg, Deinsdorf, D√ºrnfeld, Eibelhof, Eixendorf, Farchern, Freudenberg, Gammersdorf, Geiersdorf, G√∂riach, Gottesbichl, Gro√üg√∂rtschach, Gundersdorf, Haag, Hollern, Kleing√∂rtschach, Kreuzbichl, Kronabeth, Lassendorf, Latschach, Leibnitz, Magdalensberg, Matzendorf, Ottmanach, Pirk, Pischeldorf, Portendorf, Reigersdorf, Sch√∂pfendorf, Sillebr√ºcke, St. Lorenzen, St. Martin, St. Thomas, Stuttern, Timenitz, Treffelsdorf, Vellach, Wutschein, Zeiselberg, Zinsdorf.Klagenfurt-Land and is composed of 13 cadastral subdivisions (\\"Katastralgemeinden\\"): Zinsdorf, Reigersdorf, Ottmanach, Wutschein, Gammersdorf, Schurianhof, Timenitz, Vellach, Freudenberg, Portendorf, Zeiselberg, Lassendorf, St. Thomas:de:Magdalensberg (Gemeinde) All the villages have also Slovenian names.See Slovenia or German versionPaul Zdovc, Slovenska krajevna imena na avstrijskem Koro≈°kem, raz≈°irjena izdaja.

Name The municipality took its name (\\"Magdalene's Mountain\\") from the mountain on its territory, which is renowned for the extensive Celtic settlement on the hilltop, which was probably the royal capital of the Celtic kingdom of Noricum. The excavations that have been going on for a century now have, however, so far not brought to light any traces of the Celtic town. This might be due to the fact that the excavations were focussed on the spectacular centre of the settlement,Verena Gassner et al., Am Randes des Reiches. Die R√∂mer in √ñsterreich (=√ñsterr. Geschichte 15 BC - 378 AD), Vienna 2003, p.47 which was obviously completely \\"upgraded\\" by the Romans from about 50 BC onwards, before they started on building the municipium of Virunum, the new capital of the Roman Province of Noricum at the foot of the mountain. The Celtic settlement's name is still unknown. For a while it was assumed to be the Noreia of ancient sources, then this idea was rejected, and now the archaeologists in charge of the excavations think that the Roman city of Virunum had probably been given the name of its Celtic hilltop predecessor. Youth of Magdalensberg The Youth of Magdalensberg, originally a Celto-Roman piece of art The most spectacular find was made as early as 1502: a perfect statue of a young man. The beautiful \\"J√ºngling vom Helenenberg\\",Gernot Piccottini, Die besten Skulpturen der Austria Romana In: Das ist K√§rnten, ed. State Government of Carinthia, rev. ed., Klagenfurt 1978, p. 61 so named after the mountain's name at that time which was Helenenberg, was a European sensation and as the finest example of Greek sculpturing in the monarchy has found its way into the Vienna Museum of Art. For tourism's sake the young man was renamed \\"J√ºngling vom Magdalensberg\\" and copies of the statue can now be seen both in the Magdalensberg museum and in Klagenfurt. The \\"original\\" was then identified as a Roman copy of a Greek original of the 5th century BC;Gernot Piccottini, Die besten Skulpturen der Austria Romana In: Das ist K√§rnten, ed. State Government of Carinthia, rev. ed., Klagenfurt 1978, p. 60 Gernot Piccotini was director of the State Museum of Carinthia in Klagenfurt and in charge of the Magdalensberg excavations recently, however, it turned out to be an early Renaissance copy of an original Roman copy of the Greek original both of which had gone lost, yet their beauty has been preserved. Triglav Roman Empire According to Barry Cunliffe, Noricum was from the time of the Roman Republic a friendly ally of Rome. Trade between the two states was intense, particularly from Noricum's iron, gold, and agricultural produce. \\"The adjacent trading centre of Magdalensberg consisted of two elements, a native oppidum on the summit of the mountain and a Roman trading colony below. The oppidum was the principal administrative centre of the kingdom and the residence of the royal Noricum family, and as such provided a natural focus for Roman merchants. The Roman colony developed on a south- facing terrace below the oppidum. The earliest buildings were of timber and can be dated to c. 100 BC but by 30 BC the traders' houses were built in stone and were decorated with murals depicting classical mythological scenes painted by immigrant Roman artists. The focus of the colony was a large open forum where the commercial transactions would have been carried out. The Roman merchants who lived and worked here were representatives of the great business houses, mainly from Aquileia, and like all traders in foreign lands they surrounded themselves with the outward and visible signs of their own culture. The scale of the trade with Rome was considerable and acted as a spur to local production; it also introduced the Roman lifestyle to the natives who, over the decades, increasingly embraced Roman luxuries and Roman manners\\" (Cunliffe, 2001). Saint Cyril, one of the major Slavic saints, symbol of Slovenes in the regions in the village of Saint Martin in Freudenberg =Slovenian cultural history= The area is also an important centre of the cultural and State history of the Slovenians. Numerous settlements emanate from the pre-feudal Slavic social structure, namely the so-called kosezi which were later named in German Edlinger.Wilhelm Wadl: Magdalensberg: Natur ‚Äì Geschichte ‚Äì Gegenwart.

Verlag Johannes Heyn, Klagenfurt 1995, Those were the electors of the prince of the State of Carantania, whose centre was precisely nearby in the village of Karnburg (Slovenian: Krnski grad) in the valley of Zollfeld. The famous ritual departed from a village nearby the Municipality. In Thomas Jefferson's personal copy of Jean Bodin's Treatise on Republican Government (1576), Jefferson's initials appear next to the description of the ceremony. A myth has developed that this inspired Jefferson during the creation of the US constitution. However, there is no evidence for this theory and it has been dismissed by mainstream scholars.Carmichael, Cathie, & James Gow. 2000. Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State in the New Europe.

Namely, Pavle Zablatnik, a local ethnologue, identified the pilgrimage on four hills departing of the peak of the Magdalensberg-mountain as being pre-christian, so it had to be first inculturated in to the Slavic culture before being practiced today. Also, the three headed stone of Magdalensberg is said to be a major example of early Slavic art from the 8th. to the middle of the 9th Century that represents at its perfection the process of Inculturation of the Slavic main divinity Triglav (the three headed god), as it would otherwise be destroyed during the early phase of christianization of the Slovenes.Bojan- Ilija Schnabl: Inkulturacija, fenomen kulturnih procesov.

It has operated continuously since 1882. Goldens' provides castings to a variety of industries, including agricultural, construction, power transmission, defense, and large vehicles.  Operations  Goldens' Foundry began operations in Columbus, Georgia in 1882 as Goldens' Brothers, founded by 32-year-old Theodore Earnest \\"Theo\\" Golden and 24-year-old John Poitivent \\"Porter\\" Golden. At the beginning of 1889, Goldens' Brothers was incorporated, with the financial support of Abraham Illges, and renamed Goldens' Foundry and Machine Company. Goldens' is still owned and operated by descendants of the original three founders. George Golden Boyd, Sr., president and CEO, and John Thomas Boyd, Jr., vice president of sales, continue to lead the family-run company to this day. Likewise, George Boyd's three sons, George Jr., Ed, and John have assumed primary roles in administration, operations, and sales. The foundry went through numerous upgrades, growing into a facility. With integrated core, molding, cleaning, and machining, and finishing facilities under one roof, Goldens' is able to provide a single-source resource to casting consumers. Goldens' employs more than 200 skilled workers at their Columbus location, and approximately 40 at their newer operation in Cordele. Quality Assurance Goldens' utilizes numerous techniques to ensure quality is maintained at both facilities. The company is ISO 9001-2000 certified by Lloyd's. Lean manufacturing principles are also in place throughout the facility, and 5S standards are in place in each department.  Columbus casting facilities  Tight flask cope and drag molding line In Columbus, Casting operations in Goldens‚Äô are supported by four Brown-Boveri coreless induction furnaces, coupled with 1200¬∞F (650¬∞C) preheating, and a comprehensive core shop employing isocure, shell and no-bake (air set). Steel and quality scrap are purchased from a variety of sources. =Large casting facility= Goldens‚Äô Large Casting Facility utilizes a Heinrich Wagner Sinto automated molding machine. Using this (48x48 18/18) high pressure machine, ductile iron and gray iron casting capability includes the cost efficient manufacture of large castings. The Sinto incorporates the Seiatsu blow squeeze process, and provides opportunity to produce short run and high-volume orders. The goal with a tight-flask machine such as this is to create near net-shape castings, reducing the need for machining and other processing operations. Charging a Ductile Iron Ladle =Small casting facility= Goldens' small casting facility consists of three Hunter molding machines. The machines produce castings ranging from a few pounds to more than 200 pounds. =Centrifugal castings= Centrifugal Casting cools and hardens as it spins Goldens' utilizes a specific centrifugal cast operation for adding iron liners to steel drums. In Goldens‚Äô centrifugal casting process, molten iron is poured into a hollow cylindrical mold spinning on a horizontal or vertical axis at speeds generating 40 to 70 Gs of centrifugal force. This force distributes the molten metal, promotes directional solidification, and improves casting integrity by forcing impurities to the inside surface. Centrifugal casting at Goldens' is designed for specific product applications, as opposed to other foundries strictly devoted to the centrifugal process, such as steel pipe foundries. The centrifugal casting process was added in the late 1990s as a complement to the green sand mold processes already in place. =No bake molding= Goldens' added a fourth molding line, a no-bake sand operation in 2000. The manual molding operation allows production of much larger castings than the Sinto cope and drag machine, and is primarily utilized for Goldens' power transmission operations. This consists primarily of sheaves, pulleys, and sprockets.  Cordele casting facilities  200px Goldens' new second facility comprises the largest step in expanding output in the company's 125-year history. The facility, built in 2001, houses a brand new Savelli cope and drag (28x36‚Äô 12/12) molding line with automatic core setter to create small to medium-sized ductile and gray iron castings. Although not as fast as many vertically parted molding machines, the Savelli is capable of making ~120 molds an hour. The new machine, with the expanded resources it provides, more than doubles the capacity of Goldens' casting production. The facility also includes cleaning, finishing, and machining centers. The building has previously housed two other foundries, Georgia Ductile and Wescast - Cordele. Both were foundries focused on supplying automotive parts for the US car industry. Operations at the new Golden facility began in May 2007.  Machining operations  Not only a foundry, Goldens' machining facilities allows it to provide more services to casting consumers. Goldens' machining facilities handle most operations their customers need. The operations primarily consist of turning, milling, and drilling operations, although operators perform a limited number of threading, painting, tapping, and sub-assembly operations. The Columbus machining facility is larger than the Cordele facility, having been there since the late 1800s. The Columbus machining facility includes a larger variety of machines as well, while the Cordele facility currently only maintains horizontal milling and drilling machines. The Columbus machining center uses horizontal milling and drilling machines with table sizes ranging from 400mm2 to 630mm2. Vertical machines range from 20\\" x 39.5\\" to 22\\" x 44\\".  Industries served  Goldens' serve a variety of industries, such as construction machinery, pumps and compressors, petroleum, mechanical power transmission, highway and off- highway trucks, farm machinery and equipment, and medical/surgical equipment. Goldens' utilizes both gray iron and ductile iron technology.

Sighet Hasidism originated in the town of M√°ramarossziget, Hungary (, now Sighetu Marma»õiei, Romania). Siget is the parent dynasty of the more famous Satmar Hasidic dynasty. Since 1980, the leadership of Siget and Satmar have been united in the person of the Admor of Satmar, though the two groups continue to operate separate synagogues and retain differences in certain customs. Founding Hasidism was brought to Hungary by Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum of Ujhel (known as the \\"Yismach Moshe\\"), a disciple of the \\"Chozeh of Lublin\\", Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin. The Sighet Hasidic dynasty began with Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum (1808‚Äì1883), his grandson. The town of Sighet was in need of a rabbi to lead the Beis Din and answer the Jewish towns-people's religious questions. Teitelbaum applied, and was accepted. During his career, he authored his famous book, Yetev Lev. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Chananya Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum (d.1904). Rabbi Chanaya Yom Tov Lipa's most famous contribution to Sighter Hasidus is the work Kedushas Yom Tov, a commentary on the Chumash. After him, it would become customary for the Rebbe of Sighet to author a commentary on the Torah. He was also the father of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who, at the time, was known as the illui (child prodigy) from Sighet. After his death in 1904, it was not clear which of his sons would succeed him. Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum was his oldest son, and, thus, the apparent heir; but Joel Teitelbaum was the most famous of his children. Rabbi Joel accepted a position as the posek and Av Beis Din of the town of Satmar, and Rabbi Chaim Tzvi took inherited leadership of Sighet. Rabbi Chaim Tzvi authored his own work, Atzei Chaim, a name by which he himself is commonly known. He had two sons, who he orphaned early in life: Rabbi Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum, who succeeded him; and Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum. Destruction in Europe It was during the reign of Rabbi Yekutiel Yehuda Teitelbaum that the Holocaust came to Hungary. Hungary was officially a German ally, but had refused to send its Jews to Germany without knowing their exact fate. Hungary, like Switzerland and Spain, was thus perceived as a relative haven for Jews, and many Jews who could have escaped to Romania remained in Hungary, believing it to be safe. Jews from other points in Europe, including the Admor from Belz, also sneaked into Hungary to escape the Holocaust. In 1944, however, Germany invaded Hungary and deported its Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp, including the inhabitants of Sighet. Rabbi Yekutiel Yehuda Teitelbaum and his family all died in Auschwitz, with the exception of Moses Teitelbaum. After the Holocaust, Moses Teitelbaum assumed control of the Sighet Hasidic group, and was faced with many painful and difficult questions in Jewish law. He also had to cope with the loss of his wife and children. He survived the Holocaust, and moved back to Sighet for a brief time, before the persecution of religious Hungarians by the Communists became too great. He then moved to America.  Rebuilding in America  In America, Moshe Teitelbaum began rebuilding the Sighet Hasidic group within his uncle Yoel Teitelbaum's stronghold of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, and later moving to the Boro Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he established a Siget synagogue. After Rebbe Moshe Teitelbaum moved to Boro Park, his son, Rabbi Aharon, the current Satmar Rebbe of Kiryas Joel, became the rabbi of the Siget synagogue in Williamsburg. Currently, one of his sons, Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum, is the rabbi in the Siget synagogue in Williamsburg. After Rebbe Moshe became Satmar Rebbe upon the passing of his uncle Rebbe Yoel, his son, Rabbi Zalman, the current Satmar Rebbe of Williamsburg, became the rabbi of the Siget synagogue in Boro Park, a post he kept until he was assigned by his father to be the rabbi of the Satmar synagogue in Jerusalem. Currently, one of Rebbe Zalman's sons, Rabbi Yaakov Ber Teitelbaum, is the rabbi in the Siget synagogue in Boro Park.

Originated by Pamela Bellwood in the series' 1981 pilot episode, \\"Oil\\", Claudia is initially the estranged, emotionally troubled wife of Denver‚ÄìCarrington geologist Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins). She later becomes entangled in the intrigues surrounding the Carrington family, and is married for a time to Steven Carrington (Jack Coleman), and later his brother Adam (Gordon Thomson). Bellwood left Dynasty at the end of the sixth season in 1986. Claudia is portrayed by Brianna Brown in the 2017 reboot of the series. Original series =Appearances= Pamela Bellwood began playing Claudia Blaisdel in the Dynasty premiere episode, \\"Oil\\", on January 12, 1981. The character was written out after the October 20, 1982 third season episode \\"The Wedding\\", but Claudia reappeared in the March 30, 1983, episode \\"The Dinner\\" later that season. Bellwood rejoined the series as a regular cast member in the October 19, 1983, fourth season episode \\"The Note\\" and remained until the end of the sixth season. Rather than incorporate Bellwood's pregnancy during the 1985‚Äì86 season into the character's storyline, her appearances were filmed in such a way as to conceal her condition. Later, her character was absent from several episodes in the middle of the season while she delivered her baby. At the end of the season, however, producers ultimately decided to kill Claudia off. Claudia's final episode was the sixth season finale \\"The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta\\" on May 21, 1986. =Storylines= Season 1 As Dynasty begins in 1981, Matthew Blaisdel returns to Denver from a long-term assignment in the Middle East to discover that his wife Claudia has been released from the sanitarium where she had been living since her breakdown in 1979. Matthew and daughter Lindsay find Claudia trying to restart her life, living on her own and working in a diner. Though struggling with his feelings for Krystle Jennings ‚Äî whom he had fallen in love with while Claudia had been institutionalized but who is now engaged to Matthew's boss Blake Carrington ‚Äî Matthew invites Claudia home to rebuild their marriage. Fragile Claudia is desperately trying to reconnect with Lindsay, who had been hurt and traumatized by Claudia's breakdown. Already tenuous, Matthew and Claudia's relationship is further strained as she realizes that he still has feelings for Krystle. Claudia is drawn to Blake's sensitive son Steven Carrington, who is struggling with his sexuality. Lindsay is devastated as she overhears Claudia accusing Matthew of only marrying her because she was pregnant. Matthew leaves Blake's employ to run his own rig, and soon their rivalry over Krystle transforms into a fierce rivalry over oil. Meanwhile, Claudia's friendship with Steven turns into an affair. Later, Claudia is called as a defense witness for Blake in his trial for the murder of Steven's former lover, Ted Dinard. Blake's lawyer argues that Steven's relationship with Claudia \\"proves\\" that Ted was a harmful influence on his son. Her secret out, Claudia knows her marriage is over and attempts to run away with Lindsay, only to crash her car in the first season finale, \\"The Testimony.\\" Season 2 When Claudia wakes in the hospital in the season two premiere \\"Enter Alexis,\\" she learns that Matthew has taken Lindsay and left the country. She tries to kill herself with sleeping pills but is rescued by Dr. Nick Toscanni, a friend of Blake's. Feeling responsible for her troubles, Blake had sent Nick to check on her; Claudia soon accepts Blake's offer to convalesce at the mansion, and begins therapy with Nick. Steven asks Claudia to marry him, but she declines, admitting that she is still in love with Matthew. As 1982 begins, Claudia is well enough to leave the Carrington mansion, moving into her own apartment and taking a job working for Blake's company, Denver-Carrington. In \\"The Iago Syndrome,\\" Cecil Colby offers to help Claudia find Lindsay if she agrees to spy on Blake, and she reluctantly agrees. When he asks for information that she is unable to access, Cecil suggests that she sleep with his nephew Jeff Colby and make a copy of his key. Claudia does so in \\"The Baby,\\" but is overcome with guilt; Jeff learns of her duplicity but blames Cecil. In \\"The Gun,\\" Claudia intercepts a Telex relating that Matthew's crashed jeep had been found in South America with \\"no signs of life.\\" Realizing that Cecil had already known that Matthew and Lindsay are dead, she plans to kill Cecil. Claudia is interrupted by Krystle, who attempts to take the gun away from her, and in the struggle Claudia is shot. With Claudia in surgery, the police doubt Krystle's version of the shooting; Claudia survives but her memory is spotty. She begins to obsess about Krystle's affair with Matthew. Somewhat hostile towards Krystle, Claudia begins to unravel in \\"The Two Princes\\" and begins packing for Ecuador, but Blake finally receives word that Matthew and Lindsay's bodies have been found. As the truth sinks in, Claudia remembers reading the first Telex, and the truth about Krystle's innocence in the shooting. Later, however, she hears the infant son of Jeff Colby and Blake's daughter Fallon crying; picking up the child, she calls him \\"Lindsay.\\" The baby is kidnapped in the second season finale \\"The Cliff,\\" and no one seems to notice that Claudia is not quite herself when she reports seeing a \\"foreign- looking man with a dark beard\\" on the grounds around the time the baby had disappeared. Season 3 Claudia herself disappears from the mansion in the third season episode \\"The Roof,\\" and becomes the prime suspect in the kidnapping. She rents an apartment, cradling a baby she calls \\"Lindsay,\\" but the landlady soon recognizes her from television reports and the police arrive. Cornered on the roof, a confused and unstable Claudia refuses the pleas of the Carringtons to give back the baby she thinks is her daughter. Startled by an officer, Claudia trips, and the baby plunges over the side of the building‚Äîbut it is only a doll. In the October 20, 1982 episode \\"The Wedding,\\" Jeff and Fallon's son is recovered from the real kidnapper, and Claudia returns to the sanitarium. Steven later visits her in the March 30, 1983 third season episode \\"The Dinner.\\" Season 4 A recovered Claudia is released in the October 19, 1983 fourth season episode \\"The Note,\\" and she and Steven make love. Steven is battling his father Blake over custody of Danny, Steven's son with his ex-wife Sammy Jo; Claudia devises a plan to secure Steven's victory. She and Steven marry in \\"Tender Comrades,\\" and they are promptly awarded custody of Danny. Claudia begins receiving flowers and gifts that appear to be from Matthew. She and Steven visit the crash site in South America and view the wreckage of Matthew and Lindsay's car to convince Claudia that they are truly dead. However, upon returning home, Claudia receives a phone call from Matthew. As the calls continue, Krystle realizes that they are merely tape recordings. Claudia recalls that Matthew sent her tapes while she was hospitalized; she learns that Matthew's mother sold the tapes to an unknown man. Blake later figures out that the buyer was Morgan Hess, a private investigator with ties to his ex-wife (and Steven's mother) Alexis Colby. Hess, however, is working for Sammy Jo, who has decided to fight for custody of Danny. Season 5 Claudia and Steven's marriage is strained when she suspects that Steven is having an affair with a male co- worker, Luke Fuller. While Steven struggles with his attraction to Luke, Claudia is drawn into a brief affair with Dean Caldwell. Claudia confesses the affair and they separate; Claudia attempts to reconcile with Steven, but continues to catch him and Luke together. Claudia turns to Adam for support, and they also have an affair. Claudia divorces Steven and starts a relationship with Adam. Blake blames Claudia's leaving for \\"turning Steven gay\\" again and orders Adam to end the relationship. Adam agrees, but secretly tells Claudia that nothing will break them up. Amanda Carrington invites Claudia to her wedding to Prince Michael of Moldavia, which she attends despite the conflicts with Blake and Steven. When terrorists attack the wedding in a spray of gunfire, Luke shields Claudia and pushes her to the ground. Season 6 Claudia survives the terrorist attack (although Luke does not) and returns to Denver, where she and Adam are married. Ironically, Luke's death helps to repair her damaged relationship with Steven and they become friends. In \\"The Proposal,\\" Claudia is informed of the death of Matthew's former business partner, Walter Lankershim, and inherits his oil well Lankershim-Blaisdel 1 (from the first season). Unfortunately, Blake had absorbed the well into Denver-Carrington years before, and flatly refuses to release it to her. Dreaming of financial independence, a furious Claudia blackmails Adam into using his ill-gotten power of attorney over Blake‚Äôs affairs to turn the well over to her. When the well turns out to be dry and worthless, Claudia snaps. In the May 21, 1986, sixth season finale \\"The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta,\\" Claudia reveals Adam's duplicity to Blake and moves into La Mirage. While obsessing about the Carringtons who have lied to and betrayed her, she accidentally sets her room on fire. The blaze consumes the entire hotel, putting several Carrington lives in danger.\\"The Choice\\" features Pamela Bellwood's final appearance as Claudia. Season 7 A devastated Adam reports to Blake in the seventh season premiere \\"The Victory\\" that Claudia is dead; a body burned beyond recognition had been discovered in the aftermath of the fire, wearing Claudia's wedding ring. Others have also died, and Blake is soon arrested and accused of arson. In \\"The Arraignment,\\" Blake's niece Jackie Deveraux, injured in the fire, remembers seeing Claudia with flames behind her, proving that the blaze started in Claudia's room. The charges against Blake are dropped. Reboot A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and Brianna Brown was cast as Claudia in March 2017. The show received a series order in May 2017, with Brown scheduled to recur in the role. The new series premiered on October 11, 2017. =Development= Executive producer Sallie Patrick said of reimagining the series: The mystery is resolved by the seventh episode, \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\", and Claudia is sent to a sanitarium. Delia Harrington of Den of Geek called the story \\"the cleanest way to wrap up Matthew's murder, but also like a bit of a misuse of someone who could have caused more thorny problems for the Carringtons.\\" Patrick said: =Storylines= Season one In the premiere episode \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", Claudia is married to Matthew Blaisdel and recovering from a car accident, in which she suffered a head injury that has left her with memory loss. Matthew's affair with Cristal is in the past, but Cristal's engagement to Blake Carrington prompts Matthew to resign from Denver Atlantic. On his final job for Blake, Matthew is injured in an explosion, and later dies. Distraught over Matthew's death, Claudia accuses Blake of murdering him. In \\"Spit It Out\\", the explosion is determined to have been caused by sabotage. Matthew's friend Willy Santiago confides in Cristal that before his death, Matthew refused Blake's offer of a job transfer to China. Blake and Cristal visit Claudia, writing her a large check to ease her worries and offering to pay for the funeral. In \\"Private as a Circus\\", Claudia sees a sex tape of Cristal and Matthew which has been leaked online, and the Carringtons are cleared of wrongdoing in Matthew's death by Willy's suicide note. After Claudia confronts her in public in \\"Company Slut\\", Cristal apologizes to an irate Claudia, who chases Cristal into the street and is accidentally hit by Blake with his car. Claudia is pregnant, and Cristal insists that she stay at the mansion to convalesce in \\"I Exist Only for Me\\". Claudia bonds with Cristal's nephew Sam Jones, who encourages her to take advantage of the luxuries available at the mansion. Claudia's erratic behavior convinces Blake and Cristal that she should leave, but Sam and Cristal learn that Claudia has been taking the wrong medication. In \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\", it is revealed that Claudia has been faking her memory problems. She had gotten into a car accident after Matthew told her he was leaving her for Cristal, but pretended to have prolonged symptoms. Holding the Carringtons at gunpoint, she admits to causing the explosion that killed Matthew, though his death was not her intent. Claudia wants Cristal to watch her kill Blake, but the rest of the family is able to overpower her. With Police Chief Aaron Stansfield's help, Blake sends Claudia to a sanitarium rather than prison. Blake's daughter Fallon visits Claudia looking for incriminating information on her father in \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", and promises to get Claudia released in exchange for the records Matthew kept. Claudia is later visited by Matthew, who is alive and vengeful toward the Carringtons. In \\"Dead Scratch\\", Matthew helps Claudia escape the sanitarium, and they infiltrate the mansion. Claudia snaps and confronts Cristal with a gun. Matthew steps between them as Claudia fires, except that Matthew is a figment of her imagination, and Cristal takes the bullet. Claudia flees with Hank Sullivan, Alexis Carrington's lover who has been pretending to be Blake and Alexis' long-lost firstborn, Adam Carrington. Season two Claudia reappears in \\"Queen of Cups\\", having given birth to a son she has named Matthew. She berates Hank for his failure to extort money from the Carringtons, and vows to do it \\"her way\\". In \\"That Witch\\", Hank cuts Claudia out of his payoff from Alexis. Realizing that Claudia is unhinged, he takes baby Matthew and leaves him on Alexis's doorstep. In \\"A Temporary Infestation\\", Alexis leaves Matthew to be found by Sam, who names him Little Blake. Sam sees a pregnant Claudia in his wedding photos in \\"A Real Instinct for the Jugular\\", and Alexis makes the connection that she is Little Blake's mother. Sam learns that Claudia has escaped the institution, and wonders if she killed his aunt Cristal and set the fire. Claudia rages over her missing child, and Little Blake disappears from the nursery. In \\"Crazy Lady\\", Claudia hides out in a hotel with baby Matthew, but a televised plea by Blake and Alexis leads the authorities to her. A hysterical Claudia has the baby on the roof, and Blake, Fallon, Cristal, and Sam try to coax her away from the edge. Claudia admits to killing Blake's late wife Cristal, and then trips and accidentally tosses the baby off the building. It is only a doll, and Kirby Anders discovers that Manuel the nanny actually kidnapped the baby. After Little Blake / Matthew is recovered, Claudia is arrested for murder, and Sam decides that the baby should be raised by his grandparents, the Blaisdels.

The niece of central protagonist Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans), Sammy Jo marries and has a son with Steven Carrington (Al Corley, later Jack Coleman). Originated by actress Heather Locklear during the series' second season in 1981, Sammy Jo was a recurring character until the end of the fifth season in 1985, when Locklear was promoted to a permanent cast member. The character remained on the series until its finale in 1989, with Locklear reprising her role for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. In The CW's 2017 reboot of the series, actor Rafael de la Fuente portrays a gay male version of the character named Sam \\"Sammy Jo\\" Jones. Original series =Storylines= Season two After traveling the amateur race car circuit with her stepfather, Frank Dean, young Sammy Jo Dean is sent to Denver to stay with her aunt, Krystle, who has recently married millionaire Blake Carrington. Sammy Jo becomes romantically involved with Blake's son, Steven, who has been struggling with his sexuality. Neither Blake nor his ex-wife, Alexis, particularly care for Sammy Jo, who is a bit common for their tastes. Sammy Jo and Steven elope, much to the disapproval of the rest of the family. It soon becomes clear that Sammy Jo has married Steven for his money, as she starts buying expensive clothes and charging them to Blake. Sammy Jo overhears Steven talking with Alexis about the secret possibility that Blake is not Fallon's biological father. Later, while drunk and arguing with Fallon at a party, Sammy Jo confronts Fallon with this revelation. A pregnant Fallon drives off upset and crashes her car, resulting in an emergency C-section. When Alexis learns that it was Sammy Jo who told Fallon that Blake was not her father, she offers Sammy Jo a check for $20,000 to sign a declaration stating that she and Steven never consummated their marriage so that it can be annulled. Sammy Jo refuses to sign, and instead blackmails Alexis by threatening to show Steven the declaration. Sammy Jo takes the $20,000 and leaves Denver. Steven follows her to Hollywood, but she rejects him, telling him that he cannot give her the material things that she wants. Season three While Steven is missing and presumed dead in an oil rig explosion, Sammy Jo returns to Denver with a baby, Danny, who she claims was fathered by Steven. Sammy Jo leaves the baby with Blake and Krystle, and moves to New York to pursue a modeling career. When Steven turns up alive, he goes to New York and suggests that they marry. Sammy Jo refuses. Season four Steven's new wife Claudia starts receiving gifts and phone calls seemingly from her presumed dead ex-husband, Matthew Blaisdel. Steven and Claudia eventually track the ruse to Morgan Hess, a private investigator with ties to Alexis. However, it is Sammy Jo who has employed Hess, and she returns to Denver to fight for custody of Danny. Season five Sammy Jo tricks Steven's brother, Adam, to take her to the airport, allowing her to kidnap Danny. She demands $30,000 a month for his return. Claudia convinces Adam to help get Danny back. He does, and Sammy Jo returns to New York, defeated. Later, Krystle comes to visit Sammy Jo with Daniel Reece, who she says is Sammy Jo's biological father. Daniel dies soon afterward, leaving his wealth to Sammy Jo. However, Krystle is executor and refuses to disburse the inheritance until Sammy Jo \\"straightens up\\". Furious, Sammy Jo returns to New York, vowing revenge. When her actress friend Rita Lesley practices a new role in a blond wig, Sammy Jo realizes she is a lookalike for Krystle. Season six Sammy Jo plans to use Rita to impersonate Krystle and trick the bank into releasing her inheritance. Soon Rita's lover, Joel Abrigore, takes over the scheme, intending for Rita to embezzle as much of Blake's money as possible. Joel kidnaps Krystle, and Rita takes her place in the Carrington mansion. Sammy Jo becomes uncomfortable with the plan when she suspects that Joel and Rita poisoning Blake. In \\"The Alarm\\" (1986), a frightened Sammy Jo confesses to Steven. He saves his father from Rita while Sammy Jo frees Krystle from captivity. Blake and Krystle agree not to press charges in return for Sammy Jo's cooperation with the police search for Joel and Rita. Sammy Jo becomes romantically involved with Clay Fallmont. When she catches him kissing his ex- girlfriend Amanda Carrington‚ÄîSteven's younger sister‚Äîat the La Mirage hotel, the women get into a fight and fall into the pool while the hotel is consumed by fire. Season seven Sammy Jo tells Clay she is pregnant in \\"The Choice\\", and they marry in \\"The Letter\\". She finds out she is not pregnant but is afraid to tell Clay; she eventually does, and they dissolve the marriage in \\"The Birthday\\". With Danny acting out in school over his parents' custody conflicts, in \\"The Test\\" Sammy Jo and Steven decide to live together platonically in an attempt to give Danny a normal home life. They fall into bed together in \\"The Dress\\", but Steven realizes it was mistake in \\"Valez\\", and moves out. Season eight Steven is annoyed when Sammy Jo becomes romantically involved with Josh Harris, the quarterback on the football team Steven owns. Josh quits the team over his cocaine addiction, and proposes to Sammy Jo. When she refuses, he overdoses and dies. Sammy Jo begins dating Jeff Colby, and he proposes as well. She accepts, not knowing that he has been sleeping with his ex-wife, Steven's sister Fallon. Season nine Sammy Jo confronts Fallon over Jeff, and the women have a muddy catfight. It ends in laughter when they realize that neither one of them wants Jeff. They become friends. Sammy Jo becomes romantically involved with Tanner McBride, only to learn that he is a Catholic priest. The Reunion (1991) By the 1991 Dynasty: The Reunion miniseries, Sammy Jo has returned to her modeling career in New York. She is sleeping with her married boss, which ultimately gets her fired. Sammy Jo returns to Denver and is welcomed back into the Carrington family. Reboot A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and Rafael de la Fuente was cast as Samuel Josiah Jones, a gay male version of Sammy Jo, in March 2017. The new series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. =Characterization= The nephew of Cristal Flores (Nathalie Kelley), a Hispanic version of the original series' Krystle, Sam is a \\"cute schemer\\" who is romantically connected to Steven Carrington (James Mackay). Executive producer Stephanie Savage said, \\"With Steven Carrington out and proud, it makes sense for Sammy Jo to be a man.\\" Executive Producer Sallie Patrick said that Sam has \\"every bit of the pot-stirring troublemaker vibe that Heather Locklear had on the original.\\" De la Fuente said of the character, \\"His heart is in the right place, but he's had a rough upbringing and he's had to figure out how to survive. Sometimes he's a little bit naughty, a little bit of a schemer, but he's not a bad guy. He's not trying to harm anyone.\\" According to de la Fuente, \\"He's not really a villain, but he does naughty stuff. I think audiences are going to like him because he has a way about doing the things he does that is just very funny and charming. He uses his natural sexuality and charm to get away with murder, and it's fun to watch because he's a little bit outrageous sometimes. A lot outrageous.\\" Sam is also devoted to his aunt Cristal, with whom he shares a mysterious past in Venezuela. Patrick said of Sam, \\"It felt right to make him [Steven's] soulmate.\\" De la Fuente noted, however, that Sam's relationship with Steven will be a \\"rollercoaster\\" that will \\"take quick, sharp turns\\". He said of the attraction between the characters: Patrick said of Sam and majordomo Anders, \\"We've introduced their friendship, and I totally 'ship them together. Locking them in the basement was so much fun ... Sammy Jo is always getting in over his head, so it made sense for him to be the first one knocked out. And the funniest person to lock him in the basement with seemed to be Anders.\\" An intoxicated Sam marries a stripper named Scorpio during Fallon's bachelorette party in \\"My Hangover's Arrived\\". Showrunner Josh Reims explained, \\"We went into the episode with Sam thinking, 'I'm never going to have another relationship again.' So even though he got married under the influence, it showed that‚Äîdeep down‚Äîhe does want a relationship, whether he knows it or not.\\" The episode was later confirmed to be the season finale, since production of Dynasty was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming of only 20 of the 22 ordered episodes of the third season had been completed at that time, and Reims said he hoped to be able to use reworked versions of the remaining two episodes to start season four. He explained, \\"We were going to bring back Ryan (aka 'Scorpio') for Episodes 21 and 22, and we were going to explore the idea of Sam trying to have a relationship with this guy. It was going to be an interesting triangle if we were to bring back Fletcher, Sam's married ex-boyfriend.\\" =Storylines= Season one In the premiere episode \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", Sam has a one-night stand with Steven, and helps himself to some of the cash in Steven's pocket. Later, they meet again as both men realize that Sam's aunt Cristal is Steven's new stepmother. Steven tries to uncomplicate matters by keeping his distance from Sam, who is staying at the mansion, but is won over by Sam's compulsive honesty and thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, Sam's mother Iris is in trouble and needs money, but Cristal is unable to send any without Blake finding out. To secure the money, Sam arranges for a friend to steal Cristal's engagement ring and other valuables during a charity gala in \\"Guilt is for Insecure People\\". An incriminating phone that had been in Blake's possession is stolen as well, and Sam goes to Steven for help retrieving it in \\"Private as a Circus\\". Sam gets mad when Steven involves the police without telling him, but just as they are about to reconcile, a repentant Sam admits his complicity in the robbery to a furious Steven. In \\"Company Slut\\", Carrington majordomo Anders manipulates Sam into the path of Steven's ex-boyfriend Ted Dinard. Steven is thrown to find that Ted and Sam have slept together, and a remorseful Sam explains to Steven that he has struggled so much to survive that he has trouble turning down opportunities. In \\"The Best Things in Life\\", Cristal remembers how Sam's abusive father Alejandro caused her miscarriage when she tried to protect Iris from him. Iris comes to Atlanta for the holidays in \\"Rotten Things\\", and Sam is shocked by the revelation that Cristal killed his father Alejandro while defending Iris in Venezuela. In \\"A Well- Dressed Tarantula\\", Sam is icy to Cristal for letting him believe that his father abandoned the family. Alive and scheming with Iris, Alejandro reveals himself to an emotional Sam, who has no idea that his parents are extorting Cristal to push through their shady deal with Carrington Atlantic. Sam helps Cristal and the Carringtons turn the tables on Alejandro and Iris by taking his father's phone and impersonating him to his minions. Sam and Steven move out of the mansion to live together as platonic friends, and Fallon hires Sam as her assistant. In \\"Nothing But Trouble\\", a distraught Ted shows up at their apartment and, using drugs and believing that Steven and Sam are romantically involved, stages a scuffle with Sam and leaps out of an upper story window. Sam admits to Steven that he is in the country illegally in \\"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\\", so Steven lies his way to Ted's hospital bedside to retrieve an earring that links Sam to the accident. Anders sets Sam up with an immigration lawyer to begin the citizenship process. In \\"Our Turn Now\\", Sam is hurt when Steven puts a stop to rekindling their romance, and has Fallon set him up with a date for her wedding. Steven is jealous watching Sam get to know his date, Liam Ridley, but eventually Steven and Sam decide to get back together. With Sam facing deportation, Steven sleeps with Senator Daniels' wife Melissa, with whom he had an affair 10 years before, to help him secure an O-1 visa for Sam in \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\". Steven proposes marriage to Sam while eulogizing his grandfather, Thomas. Believing Sam to be a poor match for her son, Steven's newly returned mother, Alexis Carrington, tries to frame Sam for shoplifting in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\". Fallon thwarts the plan, and Sam assists her in a plot to expose Alexis' machinations to Steven. Steven and Sam marry in \\"Dead Scratch\\", but the Carringtons are subsequently trapped in a fire. Sam escapes, but Steven is nowhere to be found. Season two In the season two premiere \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", Sam is mourning Cristal, who died in the fire. Several women appear claiming to be the person from whom Cristal‚Äîwhose real name is Celia Machado‚Äîstole her assumed identity. Sam is aware of enough details to know that they are all lying. Steven has not yet told Sam about Melissa's pregnancy, which is starting to show. Blake exposes the truth about Melissa to Sam, who comes to accept the news of the baby as a positive thing in his life.

While initially planned for multiple platforms, the MP-RTIP is currently intended only for the RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV.Northrop-Grumman press release, May 3, 2004, accessed April 20, 2007 Overview The MP-RTIP is a \\"modular, active electronically scanned array radar system\\" designed to be scaled in size in order to fit on board different platforms. The system is being developed from earlier Northrop-Grumman radar systems, including the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JointSTARS) and the existing Global Hawk system. The next- generation system will improve the Air Force's ability to track slow-moving ground vehicles and low-flying cruise missiles. The primary improvements are a dramatic increase in resolution and an ability \\"to collect ground moving target indicator imagery and synthetic aperture radar still images simultaneously\\".Raytheon press release, accessed April 20, 2007 The Global Hawk, which currently is an air-to-ground radar platform, was originally due to receive air-to-air capability through the MP-RTIP. That capability was subsequently removed from the test program's budget, however, in a reversal, funding for an air-to-air capability is being restored.\\"MP-RTIP: Rutan To Get First Crack At Flight Test\\", Shephard Press Development Phase I of the development program began in December, 2000. The three-year program was undertaken by Northrop Grumman at a contract cost of $410 million, and focused on the basic design of the radar system. Phase II is a six-year, $888 million contract awarded by the Air Force's Electronic Systems Center in May, 2004, under which the radar system is being developed, tested and integrated. Raytheon's Space and Airborne Systems is a subcontractor on the program, tasked with hardware development. Phase II calls for the production of six systems, three for Global Hawk and three for the E-10. The Global Hawk's system is the first to be flight tested, a program for which Northrop Grumman is using its Proteus aircraft (built by Scaled Composites). The MP-RTIP is mounted in a large pod fitted under Proteus.

During the Gilded Age, the U.S. sought symbols of its emerging civilization by appropriating European architectural styles with French style architecture being considered the consummate expression of proper architectural manners. In that atmosphere, Vernon Court was constructed in 1898 by Carr√®re and Hastings to be used as a summer cottage for a young widow, Anna Van Nest Gambrill (1865‚Äì1927). The property remained in the Gambrill family until 1956, when it was auctioned. In 1963, Vernon Court Junior College, a small all girls college, was founded with Vernon Court serving as the school's administrative building until its closing in 1972.

The centre of the resort town is situated on a peninsula at the southern shore of the W√∂rthersee. In the east, the municipal area borders the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt. The municipality consists of the two Katastralgemeinden Maria W√∂rth and Reifnitz. History A first St. Mary's Church was erected in about 875 during the Christianization in former Carantania, led by the Bishops of Freising based at Innichen Abbey. It was first mentioned in an 894 deed as Maria Werd‚Äîbecause the site was at that time an island. (The Old High German term W√∂rth or Werder, like the Slovene Otok, denotes a piece of land surrounded by water.) The church served for the translation of the relics of Saints Primus and Felician and played an important role within the Christian mission in the Duchy of Carinthia. Maria W√∂rth, painting by Markus Pernhart (1824‚Äì1871) In about 1150 Bishop Otto of Freising founded a college of canons here, and had the small Winterkirche chapel built beside the collegiate church. In 1399 both churches were destroyed by fire, and afterwards rebuilt in the present late Gothic style. The Freising Prince-Bishops gradually lost their influence in Carinthia, and about 1500 the college finally became an annex of Millstatt Abbey, led from 1598 by Jesuits. With the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, Millstatt Abbey was dissolved and Maria W√∂rth passed to the re-established Bendectine St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal in 1809. Not until 1903 the present-day municipality was established on territory of neighbouring Schiefling and Keutschach. Sights Maria W√∂rth is a centre of Austrian and European summer tourism, with 330,000 arrivals (although these numbers have declined sharply since the 1950s). Today's parish church Saints Primus and Felician stands on the highest point of the peninsula, with the neighbouring Winterkirche beneath it. It is a major pilgrimage site and, due to its romantic setting, a popular wedding church. Another tourist attraction is the nearby Pyramidenkogel, an 851-meter high mountain with a 54-meter high observation platform, the Pyramidenkogel Tower. Mahler's composing hut In 1901 the composer Gustav Mahler built a villa near the hamlet of Maiernigg, on the lakeside in the east of the municipality, where he was already using a \\"composing hut\\" in which most of his works written between 1900 and 1907 were composed, including his Symphonies No. 5-8. The hut is now open as a small museum. Through his friendship with Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, Alban Berg also composed at Maiernigg, which was visited by many of the Viennese artistic elite.  Notable people  * Adolf Heinrich Bercht (1875 - 1940) was owner of Schloss Reifnitz and mayor of the capital of federal state of Carinthia, Klagenfurt between July 13, 1926 and May 31, 1931.

Geography It is located in the Klagenfurt Basin on the B 95 Turracher Stra√üe federal highway, northwest of the state capital. In the south, Moosburg borders the municipalities of P√∂rtschach and Krumpendorf, both popular bathing resorts on the northern shore of Lake W√∂rth. The nearby S√ºd Autobahn (A2) can be reached via the P√∂rtschach and Krumpendorf junctions. The Old High German name moos (\\"mire\\") refers to several swamps and ponds around the settlement, remnants of the last glacial period and today a protected area. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of B√§rndorf, Gradenegg, Kreggab, Moosburg, Sankt Peter, Seigbichl (≈Ωihpolje), Tigring (Tigrƒçe), and Tuderschitz (Tudre≈°iƒçe). History Arnulf Castle The area had at least been settled since Roman times, when it was part of the Noricum province; documented by preserved sections of Roman roads and tombstones, as well as by excavations of an ancient villa rustica near the village of Tigring. Moosburg proper is the site of the Arnulfsfeste, a hill castle first mentioned in an 879 deed. It was then located in the former Slavic principality of Carantania, which had become a Frankish march by the end of the 8th century. Arnulf of Carinthia, the Carolingian king of East Francia and Holy Roman Emperor, grew up here and used the castle as a Kaiserpfalz residence. Part of the Duchy of Carinthia from 976, the Moosburg estate was later held by the noble House of Gorizia (G√∂rz) which finally lost their remaining Carinthian possessions to the Habsburg emperor Frederick III about 1460. In the 16th century, the former Carolingian fortress was replaced by nearby Moosburg Castle and decayed. The Gothic Sts Michael and George parish church was first mentioned in a 1368 deed, it was rebuilt after demolitions by Ottoman forces in 1479. A Baroque east facade was added in the late 18th century. The present-day municipality was constituted in 1850, it has obtained the status of a market town in 1997.

The addition of Adam to the cast provided a male villain to the show. Over the next seven seasons, Adam would be motivated primarily by jealousy, undermining the professional successes of his brother Steven and brother-in-law Jeff, in an attempt to curry favor with his parents, especially his father. Adam would betray both his parents multiple times but would be forgiven, even when his acts were criminal, due to residual feelings of guilt for Adam's difficult childhood. When circumstances arise that truly make Adam sympathetic, he squanders that good will due to his selfish, jealous nature. Original series =Appearances= Robin Sachs portrays Adam in the 1991 reunion miniseries. Gordon Thomson originated the role of Adam Carrington in \\"The Plea\\", the September 1982 season premiere of Dynasty third season. According to Thomson, \\"They had planned on Adam being an impostor but they liked him so much they decided to keep him on. They tested me for 13 shows, then extended that to 24.\\" Thomson played the character until the series finale in 1989. Adam was recast with British actor Robin Sachs for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion because Thomson was unavailable, filming the daytime series Santa Barbara. =Characterization= In 1986, the New Sunday Times called Adam \\"one of the truly imaginative, despicable villains on television\\", noting that \\"Adam has raped the butler's daughter, painted poor Jeff Colby's office with poisonous, lead-based paint, tricked Blake into signing over power of attorney while he lay at death's door‚Äîand blew a competitor out of the water by plastering his son's homosexuality all over Denver's front pages.\\" Comparing Adam to J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), the villainous oil baron on Dallas, Thomson said, \\"Adam doesn't have as much money or power. But Adam is more underhanded and he isn't as blatant.\\" He added, \\"Ruthless men usually attain power.\\" Thomspn explained that soap operas need villains to drive story, and said, \\"\\"I've played heavies before but none as demonic as Adam. He's the most rotten guy in prime time.\\" =Storylines= Season 3 In \\"The Plea\\", former spouses Blake and Alexis Carrington make a televised plea for the return of their kidnapped infant grandson L.B. Colby. While on the air, Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and was never recovered. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children Fallon and Steven. Meanwhile, in Billings, Montana, an elderly woman named Kate Torrance watches the broadcast from her deathbed. She tearfully tells her grandson Michael‚Äîwhom she has raised since he was a baby after his parents supposedly died in a car crash‚Äîthat he is really Adam Carrington. After her real grandson had died in the crash, a distraught Kate had kidnapped Adam. As proof of her story, she shows Michael an engraved silver baby rattle with the monogram AAC. As her dying wish, Kate tells a stunned Michael to find and rejoin his real family. Michael agrees, telling Kate, \\"My name is Adam Carrington.\\" Still using the name Michael Torrance, Adam travels to Denver in \\"The Roof\\", and checks into the La Miranda Hotel. He meets a beautiful woman in \\"The Wedding\\", and while they flirt with each other and share a kiss, she playfully refuses to tell him her name. Adam first goes to meet Blake, who assumes that he is a con artist who saw the TV broadcast. Stunned by Blake's abrupt rejection, Adam leaves without showing him the baby rattle. In \\"The Will\\", Adam meets Alexis. She immediately accepts him as her lost child, and they have an emotional reunion. When Alexis introduces Adam to his sister Fallon, they are shocked‚Äîshe is the woman from the hotel. Adam is not bothered by their close- call with incest, but notices that it troubles Fallon. Alexis and Adam also visit a doubtful Blake, who gradually accepts the idea that Adam could be his son. Alexis offers Adam, a lawyer, a job at ColbyCo. Adam is jealous when she also recruits Fallon's husband Jeff Colby, so Adam has Jeff's office painted with toxic paint. Gradually, Jeff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. In \\"Madness\\", Alexis sends Jeff away on a vacation. Realizing that Jeff will \\"recover\\" when he's not breathing toxic fumes every day, Adam confesses to Alexis. She orders Adam to have the paint removed. He warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver- Carrington to her. Blake and his wife Krystle are suspicious of Alexis when they learn from Jeff's doctors that there is poison in his bloodstream. Fallon, however, suspects Adam, and vows to learn the truth. She notes that Adam is distressed that his family doctor from Billings is in Denver for a conference. Fallon questions Dr. Edwards, who reveals that Adam once won a court case that involved poisoning by toxic paint fumes. During this time, Adam is attracted to Kirby, Jeff and Fallon's nanny and the daughter of the Carrington majordomo, Joseph. Jeff protects Kirby from Adam's unwanted advances, increasing tension between the two men. In \\"The Search\\", a drunken Adam rapes Kirby. Adam attacks Kirby again in \\"Reunion in Singapore\\", but she is rescued by Jeff, who proposes to her. Season 4 In \\"The Hearing\\", Alexis warns Adam that he is on his own if Fallon learns the truth about Jeff's illness. Adam then tricks Alexis into signing documents that make it look like she ordered the office to be painted. Alexis travels to Montana to investigate Adam's background and learns from Dr. Edwards that Adam had experimented with drugs as a teen and suffered a psychotic breakdown. Alexis is somewhat more sympathetic to Adam at this point, feeling guilty that they gave up the search for their lost son so many years ago, and condemning him to such a tragic life. As she does not want his past drug addiction to be widely known, Alexis is resigned to suffer the consequences of his actions. She gives up her control of Denver-Carrington. In \\"The Proposal\\", Jeff attacks Adam, telling him that his new wife Kirby is pregnant with Adam's child. Surprised, Adam tells Kirby that he wants to be a father to their baby. When he learns that Kirby and Jeff plan to divorce, he proposes, and Kirby accepts in \\"Lancelot\\". Adam confesses to Blake that he raped Kirby, who is disgusted by his son. Kirby is diagnosed with eclampsia and must be hospitalized. She suffers from seizures and convulsions and doctors are forced to operate. In \\"A Little Girl\\", Adam is distressed to learn that their baby girl has not survived. He tells Kirby gently, devastating her. Stunned with grief, Adam apologizes to Blake and Alexis for the pain that he has caused them. He and Kirby decide to proceed with their wedding plans. However, Alexis blackmails Kirby into leaving Adam, who is crushed when Kirby breaks off their engagement and moves to Paris in the season finale, \\"The Nightmare\\". Season 5 Adam causes great concern when he unwillingly is duped by Sammy Jo, his former sister-in-law, into helping her kidnap her son, his nephew, Danny. Steven's wife Claudia sympathizes with Adam and encourages him to kidnap the child back, mollifying the situation. Adam is also called upon to defend Alexis against charges that she murdered Mark Jennings. Adam and Alexis's husband Dex Dexter are able to identify Congressman Neal McVane as the killer, and Alexis is acquitted. During this time, Adam mourns the death of his sister Fallon, and discovers that he has another sister, Amanda. Adam also grows closer to Claudia, and steps in to comfort her when her marriage to Steven falls apart. Despite Blake's admonition not to become romantically involved with Claudia, Adam invites her to accompany him to Amanda's wedding to Prince Michael of Moldavia. Adam promises Blake that he will end the relationship after the wedding, which is interrupted by a terrorist attack in \\"Royal Wedding\\". Season 6 After they survive the terrorist attack at Amanda's wedding, Adam proposes to Claudia in \\"The Man\\". They elope in \\"The Titans\\", and a furious Blake disowns Adam and cuts him out of his will. Meanwhile, Claudia pressures Adam to help her acquire an oil well from Blake that she believes is rightfully hers. Adam takes advantage of Blake's health problems‚Äîactually caused by Blake being poisoned‚Äîto trick him into signing a Power of Attorney. Adam is also working with Denver-Carrington on a pipeline project with Colby Enterprises. When he travels to California for a meeting, he encounters his sister Fallon, who is alive and suffering from amnesia. Fallon becomes hysterical upon meeting Adam, and accuses him of raping her. Jeff is ready to believe her accusation, but upon further counseling, Fallon realizes that her unresolved conflict over her sexual attraction to Adam when they first met was what triggered her mental breakdown and subsequent disappearance and amnesia. As part of his work on the pipeline, Adam attempts to bribe State Senator Bart Fallmont. When Fallmont refuses the bribe, Adam investigates and learns that he is a closeted gay man. Adam leaks stories to the press that Bart is sleeping with Steven, which infuriates his family but ultimately causes Bart to resign, effectively ending any opposition to Adam's pipeline deal. Meanwhile, Claudia has been increasingly obsessed with reclaiming the oil well. When Adam cannot help her, she reveals to Blake that Adam took advantage of his illness. In the season finale \\"The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta\\", Claudia accidentally sets fire to her hotel room while Adam drowns his sorrows at the hotel bar. Season 7 Adam escapes the hotel fire, but is devastated to learn that Claudia has perished in the blaze. Working for Alexis at ColbyCo, Adam attempts to seduce his father's assistant, Dana Waring. Dana is furious when she learns Adam has used her, but he convinces her that his feelings for her are true. Adam proposes in \\"The Birthday\\". Dana accepts, although in \\"The Test\\" it is revealed that Dana has a secret which she fears could come between them. Neal McVane is released from prison in \\"The Mothers\\", and tells Adam he has proof that the real Adam Carrington died as a baby. McVane begins blackmailing Adam who, recently reconciled with Blake, is panicked that he will lose everything. Adam feeds McVane insider trading information but his depression causes him to drink heavily. Adam is arrested for drunk driving in \\"The Shower\\". In \\"The Confession\\", Adam confesses to Blake and Alexis that he has learned he is not their son. Adam plans to leave Denver with Dana, but Blake convinces him not to go. Adam and Dana are married in the season finale, \\"Shadow Play\\". Just prior to the wedding, Blake and Alexis present a stunned and grateful Adam with adoption papers‚Äîregardless of what McVane says, they consider him to be their son, faults and all. Season 8 On their honeymoon, Adam tells Dana that he wants to start a family. He grows suspicious when Dana keeps avoiding the subject. He follows Dana to her doctor and is crushed to learn that Dana is unable to have children. They decide to hire a surrogate mother, and meet Karen Atkinson in \\"The Surrogate\\". After she becomes pregnant, Adam showers Karen with presents and affection, making Dana feel excluded. Meanwhile, Adam finds himself in conflict with his mother's new husband, Sean Rowan. Sean is hell-bent on destroying all the Carringtons, and blackmails Dana, who must eventually confess her secret to Adam. She cannot have children due to a botched abortion during high school; it turns out that she was a schoolmate of Adam's in Billings, and they slept together during one of Adam's drunken blackouts, leaving him with no memory of the encounter. Adam is stunned and reacts badly, accusing Dana of killing his child. Adam turns to Karen for comfort. Eventually, Adam forgives Dana and threatens to kill Sean if he hurts Dana again. Undaunted, Sean pays Karen's ex-husband, Jesse, to reconcile with her, throwing the surrogacy into question. Adam attempts to bribe Jesse to leave town, but Sean forces him to stay. After the baby is born in \\"Adam's Son\\", Karen tells Adam that she and Jesse want to keep the baby. In \\"The Scandal\\", Adam learns that McVane's story was fabricated, and Adam really is Blake and Alexis's son. Karen sues for custody, and during the trial, Alexis reveals that Sean bribed Karen and Jesse. Dana sympathizes with Karen and states that Karen is the rightful mother. Adam moves out of their bedroom. Just before the end of the trial, the baby is kidnapped. Adam is the primary suspect, but he and Steven discover that Sean is the kidnapper and are able to rescue the baby. In the season finale \\"Colorado Roulette\\", custody is awarded to Karen and Jesse. Season 9 A drunk and depressed Adam alienates his family. Dana leaves Adam and moves away from Denver. Adam continues his manipulative ways, attempting to double-cross Jeff on their pipeline work by sleeping with Steven's former secretary, Claire. Adam also seduces Virginia, Krystle's cousin, who shares a mysterious past with Dex. Adam learns that Virginia was a prostitute and humiliates her into leaving Denver. When Dex learns of Adam's actions, they come to blows. Dex tells Blake about Adam's behavior, causing a rift between father and son. Adam also flirts with Joanna Sills, Sable Colby's vice-president of mergers and acquisitions, in an attempt to help his mother with her vendetta against Sable. Blake eventually fires Adam, who returns to ColbyCo and offers Joanna a job when Sable fires her. Adam assists Alexis in investigating a mysterious mine on the Carrington property, where a 20-year- old dead body was recently found. Adam discovers a witness who claims he saw Blake put the body in the mine. Adam passes this information to Blake, and then finds the witness dead just moments after seeing Blake leave the witness's apartment. Blake accuses Adam of setting him up, but Adam insists that something more nefarious is going on. As the mystery deepens, Adam and Alexis learn that the mine holds stolen Nazi treasure and artwork. Out of spite, Adam has photographs of Jeff and his half-sister, Monica, doctored to look like they are sharing a romantic moment. In the chaos that follows, Alexis reveals that Monica is not in fact Jeff's sister, only his cousin. In \\"Catch 22\\", the final episode of the series, Adam taunts Dex when he learns that Sable is pregnant with Dex's child. The men fight and Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing and falling off a second-story balcony. The Reunion (1991) Three years later, Adam is still working for Alexis, having sold out Denver-Carrington to a foreign cartel while Blake was in jail. After Blake's release and subsequent recontrol of his company, Adam and Blake are reconciled once again. In addition, a remorseful Adam is reunited with Kirby. =Reception= Vernon Scott of the Sun-Sentinel called Adam \\"the scum of the crop\\" among soap opera villains, and noted that Thomson \\"wallows in the evil of his role.\\" He wrote, \\"Thomson is especially effective as a rotten-to-the-core villain because he plays against type. How could a guy who looks so great be such a slime ball?\\" Reboot Sam Underwood portrays Adam in the 2017 reboot series. =Appearances= A Dynasty reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. Brent Antonello debuted as the long-lost Adam / Hank Sullivan in the 2018 episode \\"A Line from the Past\\", but the character is later revealed to be an imposter. Sam Underwood began playing the real Adam in the 2019 episode \\"Parisian Legend Has It...\\". =Characterization= Underwood's costar Adam Huber, who plays Liam Ridley in the series, summed up the character: \\"It's Adam Carrington; he's always got something up his sleeve\\". =Storylines= Season one Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies) is kidnapped in the January 2018 episode \\"I Answer to No Man\\", prompting Blake (Grant Show) to confide in his wife Cristal (Nathalie Kelley) that he and Alexis had a son before Steven and Fallon. The baby, Adam, was kidnapped at six months old and never returned due to a trigger-happy police officer ruining the ransom exchange. In \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\", Alexis (Nicollette Sheridan) tells Steven (James Mackay) about Adam, and admits that she spent all of her money trying to find him. A tip from Alexis leads Steven to El Paso in \\"A Line from the Past\\", where he finds Adam living under the name Hank Sullivan (Brent Antonello). In \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Steven brings Hank / Adam home, but Blake refuses to accept him. Hank's missing finger convinces Blake that he is Adam, but Hank is actually Alexis' lover with whom she is conspiring to amass enough Carrington Atlantic shares to seize control of the company. Cristal discovers the ruse in \\"Dead Scratch\\", and Hank flees the mansion with an unhinged and pregnant Claudia Blaisdel (Brianna Brown). Season two Hank is the prime suspect in Cristal's murder, and blackmails Alexis in \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", threatening to expose their plan. He also reveals that he started the fire. Hank tries to sell the Rembrandt that Alexis gave him as collateral in \\"Queen of Cups\\", but she intervenes to keep him away from Blake. Claudia then berates Hank for his failure to get the money. In \\"That Witch\\", Hank cuts Claudia out of his payoff from Alexis. Realizing that Claudia is unhinged, he takes her baby, Matthew, and leaves him on Alexis's doorstep. In advance of the second season, executive producer Sallie Patrick said, \\"We can assume there's a real Adam out there. I don't want to confirm or deny that at this point in time, but yes. He could be dead, but...He could still be out there somewhere.\\" In \\"Parisian Legend Has It...\\", Fallon and Steven's new husband Sam (Rafael de la Fuente) fly to Paris to see Steven, who they suspect may be having a drug-induced breakdown. Steven tells them that his friend George has been staying with him, but Fallon and Sam become convinced that Steven is imagining George. They check Steven into an institution; when they are gone, George appears, and tells a sedated Steven that he has been gaslighting and manipulating him. George is the real Adam Carrington, bent on claiming what is his in Atlanta. In \\"Motherly Overprotectiveness\\", Adam introduces himself to the family at Carrington Manor with a silver rattle Blake recognizes. Six months earlier in Billings, Montana, his mother Theresa had confessed that he is not Mike Harrison as he always believed, but is really the kidnapped Adam Carrington. Fallon is dubious, Blake immediately believes the newcomer is Adam, and Alexis clings to her story that Hank is their son. Fallon offers Adam $50 million to go away; he refuses, and takes a DNA test with Blake. Fallon and Sam go to Billings and learn that Mike lost his medical license for stealing narcotics. The DNA proves that Mike is Adam, and Fallon reveals Adam's secret to Blake. Adam explains that he stole the drugs for his ailing mother, but does not tell the others that he euthanized Theresa. Adam confronts Alexis with proof that she orchestrated Hank's arrival and fake DNA test; she explains that she was desperate, and apologizes. Adam offers to keep the secret, but then pushes Alexis's face into her fireplace.

On the north and west, the Gurk (Krka) forms the municipal boundary, and on the south between Gurker Br√ºcke/Muta and Kreuth/Rute, the road to Pack forms the boundary. In 1920, on the occasion of the referendum on the affiliation of southern parts of Carinthia either to Austria or to the newly found State of later Yugoslavia, the river Gurk/Krka represented the boundary of the voting zones A and B (commemoration plaques are set on two bridges), as the zone A, comprising Poggersdorf (Pokrƒçe), was considered being largely Slovenian. = Neighbouring Municipalities = Parish Church of Poggersdorf (Pokrƒçe) = Structure of the Municipality = The Municipality is composed by four cadastral land register units: Leibsdorf (Liƒçja vas), Linsenberg (Leƒçja gora), Pubersdorf (Pobre≈æe) and St. Michael ob der Gurk (Slovenji ≈†mihel).

Until an advanced period of Middle Ages, the ancient Carantanian social group of Slavs respectively Slovenians called the ‚ÄúEdlinger‚Äù (in Slovenian ‚Äúkosezi ‚Äú) had specific social privileges. It was situated between feudality and farmers and had its own autonomous justice. It is in this tradition that developed for example the lower aristocratic domains of Eibelhof (Ovƒçjak) or Wutschein (Buƒçinja vas) which gave their names to the respective cadastral land register units.See: Wilhelm Wadl: Magdalensberg: Natur ‚Äì Geschichte ‚Äì Gegenwart. Gemeindechronik. Verlag Johannes Heyn, Klagenfurt 1995, , and following. The territory of the municipality of Poggersdorf/Pokrƒçe belonged to the higher court of Maria Saal (Gospa Sveta). In the course of the creation of the modern political municipalities in 1850, the municipality of ‚ÄúWindisch St. Michael‚Äù (Slovenji ≈†mihel) was created. For ethnopolitical reasons ‚Äì the municipality and the whole region were considered as being Slovenian ‚Äì the municipality was renamed in 1896 and its administrative center was transferred to the village of Poggersdorf/Pokrƒçe that was also nearer to the main regional road. In the course of the administrative reform of 1973, a part of the former municipality of H√∂rtendorf (Trdnja vas) was attached to it. In the last population census of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in 1910, about 59% of the population of the municipality of Pokrƒçe (Poggersdorf) declared Slovenian being their language of every day public use, which leads to the conclusion that even a higher part had or considered Slovenian being its mother tongue. During centuries, the municipality was characterized by agriculture and it is only in the last decades that the phenomenon of commuters to the regional capital city became more and more important. In 2013, the municipality was given the specific status of a ‚ÄúMarket Municipality‚Äù (German: ‚ÄúMarktgemeinde‚Äù).  Population  According to the census of 2001, the population of Poggersdorf is 2.850, 97,8 % have the Austrian nationality and 87,5 % are Catholics, 2,9 % Protestants, 0,7 % Muslims and 6,2 % without religious confession. The Jehovah's Witnesses have a worship center in Leibsdorf (Liƒçja vas). The parish church of Poggersdorf ( Pokrƒçe ) as well as its filial churches of Wutschein (Buƒçinja vas), Wabelsdorf (Vabnja vas) and Eiersdorf (Virnja vas) are formally bilingual (German / Slovenian). = Slovenian Dialect and Cultural History = Way of the Cross in Dolina The Municipality of Poggersdorf/Pokrƒçe is still bilingual with German dominance. Historically however, it belonged to the linguistic area of the autochthonous Slovenian language or dialect of the plain of Klagenfurt (called poljanski govor or poljan≈°ƒçina Celov≈°kega Polja), which is a central dialect respectively of transition of the so-called Slovenian dialect of the valley of Rosental (Ro≈æ) (the latter being formally called ro≈æan≈°ƒçina, in German Rosentaler Dialekt) and the dialect of the valley of Jauntal (Podjuna) (respectively the so-called podjun≈°ƒçina, in German Jauntaler Dialekt). The dialect was initially identified and described by Johann Scheinigg in 1882.Johann Scheinigg : Die Assimilation im Rosenthaler Dialekt, Ein Beitrag zur K√§rntner-Slovenischen Dialektforschung. Erschienen in XXXII Programm des k.k. Staatsgymn zu Klagenfurt 1882. This was confirmed by on site studies by Katja Sturm-Schnabl in 1973Katja Sturm-Schnabl, Die slowenischen Mundarten und Mundartreste im Klagenfurter Becken, phil. Diss, Wien 1973, 287 p. (quotation page 33). At the beginning of the 20th century, numerous Slovenian associations under the patronage of the church as well as private were created in order to promote the Slovenian culture and to ensure its respect and legal rights, such as the Cyril and Method-Association. The Association called ‚ÄúEdinost‚Äù (‚ÄúUnity‚Äù) of the neighbouring parish of Saint Thomas (see Magdalensberg) also developed their activities. During the ethnic cleansing of the Nazis and even before the beginning of WW II, any Slovenian activities as well as the use of the language were forbidden and persecuted and people who would speak it were put into camps at the latest in April 1942. Aster WW II, collective traumatisation and ongoing discriminations made a renewal of the Slovenian culture almost impossible.

It is a regional bilingual center of pilgrimage to Saint Mary with characteristics very similar to F√°tima in Portugal, but anterior to it. In 1849, five young girls which spoke exclusively Slovenian (in Fatima there were 3 children) had a vision of Saint Mary on a tree respectively on a stump (in Fatima it was on a tree) in the forest of Dolina. This was the origin of the veneration of Saint Mary that was promoted with enthusiasm by local and regional Slovenian inhabitants that gained a new dynamics with the construction of the church in 1860/61.

It is an established summer resort and lakeside town on W√∂rthersee.  Geography  Lakeside promenade P√∂rtschach is located at above mean sea level, on the northern shore of Lake W√∂rth, about west of the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt. The municipal territory is subdivided into the two cadastral communities of P√∂rtschach on the Lake () and Sallach. Unique locality of the municipality is P√∂rtschach on Lake W√∂rth. P√∂rtschach's neighbouring communities include Moosburg to the north, Techelsberg to the west, Krumpendorf to the east, and Maria W√∂rth to the south.  History  Basin stone Basin stones with cup marks most presumably come from the Stone Age and can still be seen in many parts of Carinthia. There is also one to be seen in P√∂rtschach, just next to a basswood tree with a park bench and next to a wooden cross. During the cultic ceremony the sacrifice, most probably blood, was placed in the little basin hole of the rock. According to archaeological findings, the Noricum main road from Velden to Krumpendorf already led across the community's territory in the Roman period. During the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps about 600 a settlement was founded, based on onomastic evidence (Slavic porecah = 'at the people who live by the brook'). In 1150 P√∂rtschach in the Duchy of Carinthia was first attested in written sources. In those days a lake castle was set up, of which little else than some scant remains of a wall can be seen to this day. A parish church was first mentioned in 1328, initially a filial church of Maria W√∂rth, the present-day building was erected in 1787 and restored in a Neo-Renaissance style in 1904/06. Parish church Saint John the Baptist Leonstein Castle ruins The nearby medieval Leonstein Castle had already fallen into disrepair by the late 17th century, but it has recently benefited from a restoration programme. It was replaced around 1490, when neighbouring Leonstain Castle was erected close to P√∂rtschach's centre. Today part of the Renaissance castle has been reborn as a hotel. A growing tourism industry started in the mid-19th century, accelerating after the establishment of the Lake W√∂rth navy in 1853. Shortly after that, in 1864, P√∂rtschach received a railway station on the new Southern Railway line from Vienna to Venice; this made it a favoured tourist destination. Famous tourists from Vienna included Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria, Gustav Mahler, and Johannes Brahms, who worked on his Second Symphony and his Violin Concerto here. After the tourism boom years in Carinthia of the 1960s and 1970s, a revival in P√∂rtschach as an events centre is under way. The goal is to develop as a \\"sustainable tourist attraction\\" affiliated to nature, culture and history.  Population  According to the census of 2001, the community of P√∂rtschach has 2,670 inhabitants. 90.3% have Austrian citizenship, the biggest groups among the foreign nationalities are Croatians (3.0%), Germans (2.3%), and Bosnia-Herzegovinians (1.3%). In terms of religion, the majority of the people are Roman Catholics (75%), followed by 10% Protestants and 1.6% Muslims. About 10% of the people do not affiliate with any religion.  Lake villas  Villa Miralago, 1893 Villa Venezia, 1891 In the late 19th and early 20th century, numerous villas were erected in the so-called W√∂rthersee style, according to Friedrich Achleitner a mix of Art Nouveau, German Romanticism, Baroque and mansion architecture. The most important representants of this specific building style were Franz Baumgartner (1876‚Äì1946), Wilhelm He√ü (1846‚Äì1916), Josef Victor Fuchs, and Carl Langhammer (1840‚Äì1906).

History The designation of SR 328 took place in 1932. Originally, the highway was a spur route that ran from Front Street, the former two-lane routing of US 33 that was designated as SR 31 at the time, in Logan, and followed the combination of Lockheed Road and the present alignment of SR 328 southeast to the unincorporated community of Union Furnace. In 1937, SR 328 was extended southwest from Union Furnace to its present southern terminus, utilizing a combination of previously un-numbered roadways and a portion of SR 56 where it crosses from Hocking County into Vinton County. Then, by 1971, the highway was shortened slightly on the north end with the completion of the US 33 four-lane divided freeway around the south side of Logan.

It used to be a firearms manufacturer and importer, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in the United States. History Charles Daly was born in New York City on October 12, 1839. In the late nineteenth century, around 1875, in New York City, Charles Daly and August Shoverling began a business importing firearms into the United States, primarily from the city of Suhl in what was then Prussia. Manufacturers for Daly at that time included Heym, Shiller, H. A. Lindner, Sauer, J&W; Tolley of England, Newman (of Belgium) and Lefever Arms. Charles Daly combination gun advertisement (1887) In 1887 Shoverling and Daly were joined by a third partner named Joseph Gales, and the company began doing business as Shoverling, Daly and Gales, before settling simply on the name Charles Daly. The original Charles Daly died suddenly in 1899, but the business continued with his son, Charles Howard Daly, taking his place until 1919, when the partnership was sold to Henry Modell. The new owners continued the tradition of importing firearms and marketing them with the Charles Daly name until the late 1920s, when the company was sold to the Walzer family, which owned Sloan's Sporting Goods in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The Walzers established a branch of Sloan's in New York City known as Charles Daly & Company. Manufacturers from all over the world produced Daly guns for the Walzers, including Beretta, Bernadelli and Miroku. In 1976, Sloan's sold the Charles Daly trademark to Outdoor Sports Headquarters Inc. (OSHI), a sporting goods wholesaler in Dayton, Ohio. In 1996, OSHI was itself sold to another firearm wholesaler, Jerry's Sport Center in Forest City, Pennsylvania. In 1996 the brand was acquired by KBI, Inc. of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which expanded the import line to include semi-auto and pump-action shotguns and 1911-style pistols and re-christened the company as Charles Daly, The Shooting Sports Specialist. In 2008, KBI formed a new division of the company named Charles Daly Defense to manufacture and market the hugely popular AR-15 type semi-automatic carbines and rifles for law enforcement, target shooting and home defense. In a departure from the tradition of selling only imported firearms, Charles Daly Defense AR-15s were manufactured in the United States. A letter from Michael Kassnar posted on the Charles Daly Website on January 29, 2010 indicated that Charles Daly and KBI were going out of business and closing their doors effective January 29, 2010. At the SHOT Show held in Las Vegas in January 2012, Charles Daly and CD Defense announced their return to the US market with distribution by Trans World Arms LLC of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. During 2017 the Charles Daly trademark was acquired by Chiappa Firearms of Italy. Sale of trademark In September 2012, Samco Global Arms, Inc. (SGAI) located in Miami, Florida, acquired the Charles Daly trademark and is importing firearms under the Charles Daly brand for the US market. Firearms imported and manufactured The firearms they import and manufacture are of all varieties and styles from all over the world: *Handguns: 1911 steel-framed pistols, from 1998 until 2008 from Armscor in the Philippines. Beginning in 2009, the new G4 model is being produced by BUL Transmark in Israel. M-5 polymer-framed 1911 pistols from BUL Transmark since 1997. A clone of the Browning Hi-Power was produced in the US from 2002 to 2006 with components from FEG in Hungary and final manufacturing by either Dan Wesson Firearms or Magnum Research in the US. 1873 style single action revolvers were manufactured by F.LLI Pietta of Italy in the mid-2000s. *While not technically under the Charles Daly brand, KBI resumed importing the Jericho 941 Pistols from Israel Weapons Industries (IWI) Ltd. in 2009. *Rifles: Bolt action Mauser and Mini-Mauser rifles were produced by Zastava Arms in Serbia from 2002 until 2005. 1892 lever action rifles are produced in Italy by Armi Sport de Chiappa. In 2008 they entered the AR-15 market with a US produced line of AR-15 type rifles and carbines under the Charles Daly Defense brand. *Shotguns: Over and under, side by side, pump action, and semi- automatics are currently produced in Turkey. All of the pumps and semi-autos are made by Akkar in Istanbul, but Sarsilmaz and ATA also produced semi-autos for Daly during the mid-2000s. SGAI is importing over and under, pump action, and semi-automatics made by Akkar factory in Istanbul, Turkey.

Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court concerning alleged discrimination against a nontenured teacher at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh. David Roth was hired as a first year assistant professor of political science in 1968 for a fixed term of one year, with a possibility of extension on mutual consent of the parties. In accordance with procedural rules set by the Board of Regents, the president of the University informed Roth he would not be rehired for the next academic year, giving him no reason for the decision and no opportunity to challenge it in any sort of hearing. The Board's employment rules provided opportunity for review of teachers \\"dismissed\\" before the end of the employment term, but did not extend these protections to teachers whose contracts were simply not renewed. Roth brought suit in federal district court alleging that he was being punished for statements he had made that were critical of the university administration. He said the decision not to rehire him infringed his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. He also alleged that the university's failure to provide a hearing violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process of law. In an opinion delivered by Justice Stewart, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require an opportunity for a hearing prior to the nonrenewal of a nontenured state teacher's contract, unless he can show that the nonrenewal deprived him of an interest in \\"liberty\\" or that he had a \\"property\\" interest in continued employment, despite the lack of tenure or a formal contract. Justice Douglas dissented, writing \\"When a violation of First Amendment rights is alleged, the reasons for dismissal or for nonrenewal of an employment contract must be examined to see if the reasons given are only a cloak for activity or attitudes protected by the Constitution.\\" Justice Marshall wrote a separate dissent saying that \\"every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment.\\" He held government to higher scrutiny than private employers and said that government employees deserve \\"fair and adequate information\\" at their terminations in order to protect against arbitrary behavior.

The two towers, called Clydesdale Tower and Cleveland Tower, are both 31 storeys tall and were part of a major regeneration and council home building scheme following World War II which in the 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of hundreds of tower blocks. Originally built and operated by the City of Birmingham, the buildings were part of a stock transfer from Birmingham local authority to Optima Community Association in 1999, and today the buildings are owned by Citizen housing association (itself an amalgamation of several West Midlands housing associations). The Sentinels were the tallest purely residential tower blocks in the city until the completion of the 102 metre tall skyscraper Bank Tower 2 in 2019. They are also surpassed by the 122 metre tall newer Radisson Blu directly across Holloway Circus Queensway with 40 floors but this incorporates a hotel as residences. History =Planning= The tower blocks were the brainchild of the Chairman of Birmingham's House Building and Housing Management Committees returning from a visit to Chicago to witness the opening of the Marina City development which consists of two 61-storey towers.Bigger is Better? Local authority housing and the strange attraction of high-rise, 1945-70, Phil Jones, University of Birmingham, 25 October 2002 The councillors decided that Birmingham needed a development similar to this and in 1965, plans began to surface for the construction of twin towers at Holloway Head to overlook the new ring road. After discussions over height, it was decided that the tower blocks should be 32 storeys tall, one storey taller than the Red Road tower blocks in Glasgow, Scotland. It was decided to construct them out of concrete, which was common among tower blocks in the city during that time. They were designed by Bryant's Ltd. and both towers were identical though angled differently to provide a different perspective to each block. =Construction= The project was approved in 1967Emporis: The Sentinels and construction of the towers commenced immediately. Cleveland Tower was completed in 1970Emporis: Cleveland Tower and Clydesdale Tower in 1971.Emporis: Clydesdale Tower Upon their opening, they had 488 flats. Recent changes to housing legislation by the incoming Conservative government allowed the Council to offer many of the flats on a cost rent basis to those not on the council housing waiting list. The flats thus initially attracted a much wider range of tenants than would usually be found in a high rise council block, including the actress Noele Gordon (who appreciated their closeness to the ATV television studios) and many gay men who found it convenient for the nearby gay bars. Although changes to the Council's letting policy subsequently ended cost rent lettings, the Sentinels have always enjoyed a wider range of residents than many other blocks and remain popular. During the height of the HIV/AIDS hysteria the number of gay men living in the Sentinels provoked hysteria in the media with the tabloid Daily Star, interviewing one new resident who said that she wore protective gloves when touching the buttons on the lift in fear of contracting the disease. =Refurbishment= In 1999, residents of The Sentinels together with four other council owned estates, voted to transfer their homes into the ownership of an independent housing association, Optima Community Association. Optima then embarked on an extensive refurbishment programme as part of a wider regeneration scheme in the Attwood Green area in Birmingham. The project at The Sentinels involved replacing windows, kitchens, lifts, refurbishing the communal areas and improving security. A new entrance was constructed as well as a roof feature, lighting scheme, which illuminates the building a blue light at night, and the addition of new cladding to the exterior of the building. In 2004, the Sentinels Residents Association submitted a petition to Birmingham City Council complaining about waste facilities. They also complained about a man, who had previously threatened suicide, being rehoused on a high floor of one of the towers.Minutes of a meeting of the Ladywood Ward Committee held on Thursday 15 April 2004 at 1900 hours, in St. Thomas' Primary School, Great Colmore Street, Lee Bank, Ladywood, Birmingham See also *Beetham Tower, Birmingham *List of tallest buildings and structures in Birmingham References External links *Clydesdale Tower on Skyscrapernews *Cleveland Tower on Skyscrapernews *Optima Community Association Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Residential buildings completed in 1971 Category:Twin towers Category:Residential skyscrapers in England ","title":"The Sentinels"},{"id":"10798166","text":"Along SR 329 in Guysville State Route 329 (SR 329) is a state highway located in southeastern Ohio.

Some earlier pieces can be found in La Gazette de Guernesey in the 1920s. She is remembered for her Guernsey-French stories and poems, and for starting the first bird hospital in the world, which she continued to run during the German occupation of the Channel Islands. Biography Ozanne was born in 1897, the daughter of a verger at Vale Church. When he was ill she used to take on his responsibilities, including grave digging, and it was in the churchyard that she developed her lifelong love of birds. After World War I she trained as a teacher in England, returning after her parents' death to teach in Guernsey. Her world-famous bird hospital was first established at Les Cordeliers in the Grange, where she lived with her companion Nell Littlefield. To pay for the birds' feed she used to make shell animals and sell them at the market. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands she carried on with the bird hospital and a German officer often helped with food. After the Occupation Marjorie Ozanne gave up teaching and moved to Bon Air, Les Adams, L'Eree, where she continued to run the bird hospital until her death in 1973. \\"The hospital became internationally known after the Occupation ended and it was perhaps the first of its kind in the world.\\"Hill, Ken. Guernsey Press, 1989 Her work at the bird hospital was shown on British television. Marjorie Ozanne had spoken Guernsey-French since her childhood and for many years wrote poems, sketches and humorous plays. Some of these were performed at the Eiseddford (Guernsey) and others published in the Guernsey Evening Press. She used the spoken bas pas lexical variation, but her spellings may seem unfamiliar or idiosyncratic, as she wrote prior to the publication of the Dictiounnaire Angllais‚ÄìGuernesiais (English‚ÄìGuernesiais Dictionary) in 1967. \\"Miss Ozanne is the most important Guernsey French writer of the last century and on a par with the two principle Guernsey-French writers, George M√©tiviere and Denys Corbet\\". Kenneth William Hill, of Guernsey, translated her works and put the Guernsey-French alongside the English translations. He commented that it was important to retain the original language as, in the 20th Century onwards, the puns and double entendres that she used do not work. Ozanne died at the Town Hall hospital, where she had been a patient for some time. She had no close relations so she was buried in an unmarked grave at the Vale church next to her parents and sister. Her grave was discovered in 1988 and La Soci√©t√© Guernesiaise organised a headstone. An unveiling ceremony in 1989 was held which was attended by friends, former students, the GSPCA, RSPB and various sections of La Soci√©t√© Guernesiaise.

It is one of the Shaolin themed films, concerning their battles against the Qing Dynasty. A sequel, called Return of the 18 Bronzemen, followed and was released in the same year. Plot The much-reviled Qing government decide to eradicate any opposition to their rulership by attacking pro-Ming families in the kingdom. One such attack sees an influential official killed, though his wife and son manage to escape thanks to the intervention of a close ally. While on the run, the son, Shaolung, is aided by his father's close friend (Jack Long) who teaches the young boy the basics of kung-fu. As time passes, the renegades must once again move on and evade capture by the Qing army. However, it is decided that the safest place for Shaolung to hide would be in the Ming-friendly Shaolin Temple where he could also further his knowledge of kung-fu. Once there, the boy finds the severe, disciplined lifestyle hard to cope with and, despite his best efforts, he lags behind his fellow pupils. Over time he does make a couple of close friends and it is their encouragement that drives him to reach his goals. Now a young man, Shaolung (Tien Peng) gradually develops into a formidable fighter and concentrates his sights on leaving Shaolin to avenge his father's death. However, to 'graduate' from Shaolin means to defeat the Shaolin bronzemen and a series of similarly fiendish tests. The first attempt to conquer these trials is unsuccessful, but Shaolung is spurred on by his straight-talking friend (Wong) and finally leaves through Shaolin's hallowed gates after a final tremendous effort. Once through the dreaded chambers, the Shaolin disciples will have the Shaolin crest of the dragon and tiger burnt into their forearms by lifting a huge bronze pot. Outside, our heroes meet up with more patriots. Shao Lung meets his uncle who tells him the true story of his past and gives him half of a royal seal, the other half belonging to his (unknown) future wife. Once on his journey again his constantly stalked by a young \\"man\\" (actually a woman in disguise), Miss Lu. After defending him from an assassination attempt, Miss Lu constantly claims how Shao Lung owes her his life, though he is still under the impression she is still a man (a typical recurring plot device in some martial arts films though it is obvious it is a woman). After another failed attempt at Shao Lung, he manages to come across Miss Lu‚Äôs half of the royal seal thus revealing she is a woman and also his wife-to-be. Shao Lung and Miss Lu meet up with Brother Wan, and in turn they meet with Brother Ta-Chi who managed to beat the Bronzemen and leave Shaolin. Ta-Chi is a mole who was placed in Shaolin by the Qings to learn kung fu and eventually kill Shao Lung. Shao Lung and Brother Wan manage to kill their former brother in self-defense, and with Miss Lu, move on to kill the Manchu general.

He was born in St Saviour in 1848 and spent most of his early life working in agriculture in Newfoundland and Lorient. He returned to Jersey in 1880 and launched a series of stories in La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey which took the form of letters supposedly written by Bram Bilo, a na√Øve and self-important ex-Centenier from St Ouen.

Taxonomy Until recently, it was placed in the genus Pionopsitta, which now is restricted to the type species, P. pileata. Furthermore, individuals previously believed to be immature vulturine parrots were described as a new species, the bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala), in 2002. Description The vulturine parrot has a total length of c. . It has a rather short, squarish tail, and a mainly green plumage, which typically is tinged blue, especially below. The chest is olive-brown. The underwing coverts are bright red, and when perched this can be hinted as an orange-red shoulder-patch. The under-tail is yellowish with a bluish tip (appears dark against light). The outer webs and tips of the remiges are bluish-black, making the outer sections of the upperwing appear quite uniformly dark in flight. The arguably most conspicuous feature, however, is its un-feathered blackish and orange-pinkish head, bordered by a broad yellow collar of feathers, followed by a second blackish collar. This bare, vaguely vulture-like head is the reason behind its common name. Juveniles have a feathered greenish head. Little is known about its behavior, but it is suspected the bare head is an adaptation to avoid feather-matting from sticky fruits. It has also been recorded feeding on seeds and berries.

Abdul Majeed; ; 20 December 1909 ‚Äì 10 July 2000) was an Indian freedom fighter, politician and a former member of the Travancore- Cochin State Assembly.Pg 20, Who is who of freedom fighters in Kerala ‚Äì K. Karunakaran Nair, 1975 He was born into one of the most prominent aristocratic Muslim families in Travancore. Influenced by the works of his uncle, Vakkom Moulavi, he became involved in social and political reform movements. Majeed was one of the early architects of the Indian National Congress in Travancore, eventually becoming the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Attingal constituency (1948‚Äì1952). Regarded as one of the great Indian nationalists of 20th century, Majeed belonged to a tradition of politics that was intrinsically value-based, secular and humanistic.Pg 66, Vol 1299, Kalakaumudi, Ormayil Vakkom Majeed (In memory of Vakkom Majeed) ‚Äì K.M. Seethi, 2000 Early life and family Majeed was born on 20 December 1909, in Vakkom, into a prominent and influential Muslim family Poonthran which had ancestral roots to Madurai and Hyderabad. His maternal great grandfather, Thoppil Thampi and maternal grandfather, Mohamed Kunju were radical for their times. His uncle, Vakkom Moulavi, was a visionary, social reformer, scholar, educationist, writer, journalist and the founder of Swadeshabhimani newspaper. Majeed was the first of four children born to Syed Mohamed and Mohamed Beevi. He had one sister: Safiya Beevi (1912‚Äì1986) and two brothers: Mohamed Abda (1914‚Äì1992), and Abdul Latheef (1917‚Äì1999). Majeed obtained his early education at St. Joseph High School, Anjengo. In 1936, Majeed married Suleha Beevi, the niece of Vakkom Moulavi. They had five children: Fathima (born 1937), infant boy (1939‚Äì1940), Najma (1943‚Äì1957), infant girl (1953-died soon after birth) and Shameema (1957‚Äì2011). Freedom struggle He was attracted to the social reform movement of his uncle, Vakkom Moulavi, as well as Narayana Guru. He came to politics in his early school days. When the Indian National Movement emerged in Kerala, Majeed was in the forefront of its leadership. He was one of the early architects of the Indian National Congress in Travancore. As a young man, he also became greatly involved in the social reform movement. Majeed was one of the few Congress leaders in Travancore who exhibited enormous courage by participating in the Quit India movement in 1942 and got arrested. He remained in jail for several months. Subsequently, when the idea of \\"independent Travancore\\" was mooted, Majeed was a staunch opponent of it and took part in the agitation against the move. He was incarcerated again for several months. When the INA hero Vakkom Kadir was sentenced to death by the British, Majeed visited him in the Madras Central jail. It was Majeed who brought Kadir's last letter to his father before the hanging. Political career Vakkom Majeed (standing right) with other members of Travancore-Cochin (Thiru-Kochi) state assembly in 1950s Majeed was a politician-extraordinary in the socio-political realm of Kerala in the 20th century. A staunch opponent of the Two-Nation Theory and Pakistan movement, Majeed argued that only a secular-nationalist India could keep the heart and soul of the masses together. In 1948, he was elected (unopposed) to the Travancore-Cochin State Assembly from the Attingal constituency. When the tenure of his term came to an end in 1952, he decided to eschew practical politics and took to serious reading. He was attracted to the writings of Bertrand Russell, M.N. Roy and several French writers. Majeed was opposed to doctrinaire politics and argued for secular-humanist perspective in politics and social issues. Majeed upheld the values of Liberalism and Modernism in Islam and called for the return of Ijtihad (freedom of thought) in Islamic traditions. He equally valued the thoughts of Narayana Guru and pointed to the increasing relevance of a \\"casteless\\" society. Later years and death The last three decades of Vakkom Majeed was the decades of his intense exploration and reading (and rereading) of nationalist history, ideology and practice. In 1972, during the Silver Jubilee celebration of Indian Independence, the nation honoured him by giving 'Tamrapatra' for his participation in the Indian independence movement. He received the 'Tamrapatra' from the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. By the end of the 1980s, Majeed's health was failing, and he was soon bedridden for a year. His wife Suleha Beevi died on 18 June 1993. Although he managed to attend few socio-political functions in the later 1990s, his health was suffering. On 8 July 2000, he fell seriously ill and admitted in a private clinic. His condition worsened soon afterward and shifted to the CCU (Critical Care Unit) of Cosmopolitan Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. On 10 July 2000 he suffered a fatal heart attack and was pronounced dead at 6:30 local time (1:00 UTC). Majeed was buried in East Jamaat Masjid (Vakkom Padinjare Jamaat Mosque) in Vakkom, alongside his ancestors.

It was originally developed in the 1950s, but has gained traction in various other national legal systems in Europe as well as the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of X and Y v. The Netherlands. The corollary of the concept in the context of the European Court and Convention of Human Rights is that a government can be held responsible for failing to prevent, through judicial or law enforcement methods, the violation of a person's human rights by another person or private, non-state actor. Drittwirkung is further subdivided into mittelbare and unmittelbare Drittwirkung. \\"The former means that the values and principles surrounding constitutional fundamental rights are to be considered by the courts when they are deciding private law cases.

The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 kW. The station is owned by Cumulus Media. Its studios are located in North Charleston and the transmitter tower is located in Mount Pleasant. History 95.1 originally signed on June 2, 1947 as WTMA-FM, the sister to WTMA AM 1250. By the late 1950s, WTMA-FM was simulcasting much of the AM's programming full-time, which was Top 40 by that point. When the FCC started to limit simulcasts of AM and FM stations in the late 1960s, WTMA-FM became WPXI in 1972 with an automated \\"beautiful music\\" format. In 1975, WPXI changed to urban contemporary as \\"Super 95 Soul\\". Although it was still automated, it was noted as being one of the few commercial urban FMs in South Carolina at the time. In 1981, WPXI dropped the Urban format as the station became WSSX, with a Top 40/AOR hybrid known as Contemporary Hit Radio. Their slogan was \\"We Are The Rock 'N' Roll Station. The All New 95 FM WSSX\\", the station went to #1 in the ratings within a year. By 1983, the station had transitioned to a fully fledged CHR radio station under their nickname \\"Hitradio The All New 95SX FM\\", again going #1 on several occasions throughout the remainder of the 1980s. By 1993, WSSX's ratings had begun to decline as the station shifted away from CHR to Hot AC as \\"The New 95 Mix\\", then later changed to Mix 95.1. This lasted until September, 1995 when the station returned to their CHR roots and their iconic nickname \\"95SX\\". Iconic DJ Danger Dan (Elm) was an integral part of 95SX in the mid 1990s. 100px In October 2007, following sister WSUY's flip from mainstream AC to country, the station invited listeners from the station to tune to 95.1FM saying \\"Welcome 96.9 Listeners.\\" As of January 2010, WSSX, whose direction favored adults and at times took a conservative approach by playing Hot AC or Pop/Rock artists, has begun to shift towards a Rhythmic-leaning direction, as it now favors Rhythmic Pop acts. This move might be due to a changing taste in its listeners' musical choices and its decision to attract a younger demo. The station's main competitor, Apex Broadcasting's WIHB, switched to a hip hop format in March 2010. This leaves WSSX as the only CHR station in the market. Their official station mascot is the 95SX's Party Parrot.

Michael was killed, aged 17, when he was hit by a motor-car whilst on a training run in High Street Doncaster (near Curnola Avenue) on Saturday evening 26 June 1971.VFL Hope Killed as He Trains, The Age, (Monday, 28 June 1971), p.1.Carter, R., \\"Rising Star is Killed\\", The Age, (Monday, 28 June 1971), p.26.  Carlton  Recruited from Myrtleford Football Club in the Ovens & Murray Football League, Kekovich was originally signed with Richmond. He was signed up to play with Carlton immediately Richmond's hold on him had lapsed.Hobbs, G., \\"Kick to Kick\\", The Age, (Tuesday, 2 May 1967), p.22. In his first Carlton pre-season practice match for 1967 he played at full-forward against Wes Lofts.Beames, P., \\"Collis hits form in Blues' first trial\\", The Age, (Monday, 13 March 1967), p.17. The Melbourne newspapers were calling him \\"Carlton's second top recruit\\" for 1967 (i.e., second to Alex Jesaulenko).Beames, P., \\"Blues get all-clear on leading recruit\\", The Age, (Wednesday, 29 March 1967), p.18. A very strong and reliable mark, and a long and accurate left-foot kick, Kekovich made his debut (as did Alex Jesaulenko) for Carlton in Round 1, 1967. =Battle for Clearance= When Carlton applied for a clearance for Kekovich in March 1967,Hobbs, G., \\"Richmond Cagey Over Successor to Neville Crowe\\", The Age, (Friday, 31 March 1967), p.24. Myrtleford refused to clear him, but granted him six match permits.

He was cleared at the last moment by Myrtleford,Hobbs, G., \\"Kekovich Cleared: No Cash Claim\\", The Age, (Thursday, 8 June 1967, p.22.Blues Help North, The Age, (Thursday, 7 March 1968), p.26. just in time for him to play in round seven (and, therefore, not miss a match). =Career= He played 34 senior games for Carlton (17 games in 1967, and 17 in 1968). He was a fine team player, who always played a strong and reliable team game. He was an excellent mark, and he had no hesitation passing the ball to a teammate who was in a better position. In one of the club's 1968 pre-season practice matches, Kekovich, playing at full-forward, had been held to only two goals by Ron Stone up to three-quarter time; in the last quarter Kekovich dominated and scored another five goals to make his total seven goals for the match.Blue Kicks Seven, The Age, (Monday, 1 April 1968), p.22. In 1968, Carlton won every match in which Kekovich took the field, and lost each of the five matches he missed: round 2 (full-forward Peter Smith, 3 goals), round 3 (full-forward Peter Smith, 1 goal), round 14 (full-forward Peter Smith, 0 goals), round 15 (full-forward Alex Jesaulenko, 3 goals), and round 16 (full-forward Bill Bennett, 2 goals). He kicked a total of 95 career goals; he kicked 6 goals in a match twice, 5 goals four times, and 4 goals six times. He was Carlton's leading goal-kicker in 1967 and 1968, kicking 36 goals and 59 goals respectively. =Last senior match= He received four Brownlow Medal votes during the 1968 season; and he was a very significant contributor to Carlton's three-point 1968 Grand Final victory over Essendon: 7.14 (56) to 8.5 (53). He played at full forward. In extremely blustery conditions, and in a torrid match, he scored four of his team's seven goals.See: At one point, as he was going for a mark, he was \\"lined up\\" at the same moment by two of Essendon's toughest defenders, Alex Epis (who was playing his last VFL game, and had been instructed by the Essendon coach Jack Clarke to \\"belt\\" Kekovich) and Neil Evans. Neither Epis nor Evans knew that his teammate was running at Kekovich and, as Kekovich noticed both approaching, he used all of his evasive skills to get out of their road. Evans smashed into Epis and knocked him out; and Kekovich remained unscathed.Dramatic end to scrappy contest, Herald-Sun, (Monday, 23 September 2008). Kekovich's four goals were scored before half-time, and it seemed that he was carrying an injury for the second half of the match. He was one of Carlton's best players, and he had made a very strong contribution to their win.Beames, P. \\"Carlton's $50,000 VFL Premiership: Four Years' Work Ends in Triumph\\", The Age, (Monday, 30 September 1968), p.26.

He had kept the severity and nature of his back ailment to himself, and the Carlton officials were not aware that the courageous and highly motivated Kekovich was secretly receiving extensive treatment, including acupuncture, each week, at his own expense. In 1969 he finally revealed that he had been badly injured when he had been kicked on the top of his right hip during a match against Fitzroy in 1968.Injury Plagues Carlton Star, The Age, (Thursday, 27 February 1969), p.28. =Carlton Reserves= Still hoping that he could return to playing senior football with Carlton, he rested, received treatment, and began training as soon as he was able to do so.Do-or-Die for Kekovich, The Age, (Thursday, 15 May 1969), p.26. He played his first game for the 1969 season, with Carlton Reserves, against Essendon on 31 May 1969 (round 9). He \\"showed outstanding form\\" and kicked four goals in the match; and \\"he reported no ill-effects from the back injury ‚Ä¶ which he had suffered towards the end of last season\\". Carlton were hoping that he would soon be restored to the senior team, because, in his absence, \\"the Carlton selectors [were] known to be unwilling to waste the brilliance of Alex Jesaulenko at full- forward\\".McFarline, P., \\"Kekovich Back\\", The Age, (Tuesday, 3 June 1967), p.28.

He \\"trained lightly\\" on that Thursday evening, and \\"did not speak to the match committee about a clearance\\". Carlton refused his request on the basis that, if he was indeed fit to play senior VFL football, Carlton needed him in their team. The match committee that had considered his request, had also sought the advice of the club doctor about the nature of his back injury. The club doctor \\"told them that at no time this season had Kekovich been fully fit\\". On these grounds, the Carlton selectors did not consider him for the weekend's Reserves Grade match, and said that \\"[Kekovich] would no be considered until the doctor had given him a fitness clearance\\". Carlton then waited to be fully informed in relation to the true extent of Kekovich's injury, his fitness levels, and their estimation of the likelihood of such an outstanding, talented footballer ever being able to return to top level VFL football once again and, hopefully, play a dominant part in Carlton's on-going future.Kekovich Turned Down by Blues, The Age, (Friday, 27 June 1969), p.22. He did not play again for the Carlton Reserve grade team in 1969.  North Melbourne  In 1970, the courageous Kekovich (still only 24) sought, and was granted a clearance from Carlton to North Melbourne. In February 1970, the Carlton secretary, Bert Deacon, apparently now in possession of the medical report from the Carlton doctor, announced that Kekovich, who had been training quite intensely in the preceding few months had been cleared, on \\"compassionate grounds\\", to North Melbourne, so that he could be with his two brothers.Carter, R., \\"Carlton Clears Kekovich to Kangaroos\\", (Thursday, 26 February 1970), p.26. Once he had transferred to North Melbourne he seemed to be training well and to be in good shape. In a March pre-season training match against Wangaratta Rovers, playing at full-forward, \\"Kekovich led well and kicked accurately, finishing with eight goals\\".North's new trio in form, The Age, (Monday, 9 March 1970), p.17. However, by the time that the 1970 home-and-away season started, his back injuries were limiting his capacity to train; and, having bravely played four Second XVIII games for North Melbourne, he was dropped from the North Melbourne training list in May 1970.Robb, J., \\"Sam Out, Brian Too\\", The Age, (Thursday, 28 May 1970), p.28.

In 1971, he founded the radical organization The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA). Ellison purchased a strip of land near Elijah, Missouri, to serve as his compound. He was also a close associate of both Richard Wayne Snell and Timothy McVeigh. Leadership Ellison was a polygamist who spent time in federal prison with his 'high priest' Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar, the founder of Elohim City, Oklahoma, became one of his spiritual advisers. He was also mentored by Richard Girnt Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations and Robert E. Miles, founder of The Mountain Church in Cohoctah, Michigan. Both extreme right leaders taught and practiced Christian Identity, a religion included on the FBI watchlist as an 'extremist religion'. Ellison had very close ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Northern Idaho-based group Aryan Nations, led by Richard Butler. Miles had a very active prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to several violent white supremacist groups, most notably the Aryan Brotherhood. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter. The siege at CSA: April 19, 1985 The ATF set up what is thought to have been a group of around 300 federal agents in Elijah, having them pose as fishermen because the area was a common destination for anglers. On the morning of April 19, 1985, they moved in with a warrant for the arrest of Ellison and surrounded the CSA compound. Some agents stayed in fishing boats in order to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers, and they walked towards a sniper hold-out, until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound; the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents, reporting to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later, and the FBI agents felt that he would not go down without a firefight. FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose in a gun battle. They convinced him that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Robert G. Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down, understanding that otherwise there would be certain bloodshed. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI agents instructed him to call in every 30 minutes in order to report on how negotiations were going. US Attorney and future Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, who would later go on to successfully prosecute Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound in order to personally join in the negotiations, ultimately leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed standoff. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Ellison, his command, and all of the males in the compound emerged, and surrendered themselves to authorities. Charges Ellison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession, and Ellison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Ellison was convicted on federal racketeering and weapons charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the Aryan Nations, which was rumored to have been strengthened by Robert Miles during his time in federal prison. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to Elohim City, Oklahoma.

Geography Althofen - Altstadt The town is located about north of Sankt Veit an der Glan and north of the state capital Klagenfurt in the Krappfeld Valley between the Gurktal Alps mountain range in the west and the Lavanttal Alps in the east. The township consists of the cadastral communities Treibach, Althofen, and T√∂scheldorf. History There are some prehistoric finds in Althofen, namely two Neolithic axes, some Late Bronze Age ceramics and a Hallstatt Age tumulus. Several small finds and some tombstones date from the Roman era. From about 600 Althofen became a settlement area of Slavic people. Altanhouun in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in a 1041 deed. Like in neighbouring Friesach, the estates were held by the Archbishops of Salzburg. The local Salzburg bailiffs resided at Althofen Castle, which was devastated in the 15th century Austrian‚ÄìHungarian War and rebuilt from about 1500 as the Neues Schloss (New Castle) under Prince-Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. Anne Tower A Catholic church was first mentioned in 1307, then under the auspices of the Friesach parish. The present-day parish church with its massive steeple is the only one in Carinthia dedicated to Saint Thomas of Canterbury, it was built about 1400, with Baroque ornamentation in the 18th century and Neo-Gothic embellishment in 1908‚Äì10. In 1230 Althofen received market rights as an important trading venue, mainly for iron (Noric steel) from the nearby mines of H√ºttenberg. In 1897 the local ironworks were purchased by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach (1858‚Äì1929), the inventor of ferrocerium (Auermetall). He developed the iron mill to a chemical plant, the later Treibacher Industrie AG, the main employer in Althofen up to today. The municipality obtained town privileges in 1993.

Davis (born 1952) is an American businessman, currently CEO and chairman of Digimarc. Formerly the head of both Imagic and Activision, he is known for his role in the development of the video game industry. Early life and education A native of New York, Davis earned a B.S. in accounting and psychology and an M.A. in criminal justice from University at Albany, SUNY, and a law degree from Columbia University. Career Davis began his professional career by establishing the intellectual property practice at the firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San Francisco, California. He assumed leadership of Imagic as it was going out of business in the North American video game crash of 1983. From 1987 to 1991, Davis was first chief operating officer, then chairman and CEO of Activision. The board of directors promoted him from senior vice president to replace Jim Levy shortly after the acquisition of Infocom, in the hopes of stemming the continuing financial damage from the crash. He had opposed the merger, and many Infocom employees believed he was deliberately working against them, changing processes that had made the game business successful. Activision co-founder and programmer David Crane was also critical of Davis: \\"Bruce Davis‚Äô biggest mistake was treating video games as commodities, rather than creative products.\\" Nevertheless, Davis's leadership of Activision began well. He led the company to a profit in his first year at the helm on strong sales growth, following 16 consecutive quarters of multimillion-dollar losses. The turnaround effort was stymied after a huge damages award for infringement of Magnavox's original home video game patents was upheld on appeal in 1988. That year Activision changed its name to Mediagenic, as Davis sought to expand the company's product lines to non-gaming software. In February 1991, Robert Kotick, backed by Steve Wynn of Mirage Resorts, staged a successful hostile takeover.Mediagenic 10-K, filed March 17, 1992. Kotick and his team then filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in cooperation with Magnavox parent company Philips in a leveraged recapitalization of Activision, as it was renamed in 1992. Kotick replaced Davis in this restructuring. Starting in 1992, Davis founded and served as president of TV Guide on Screen, a joint venture of News Corporation and TCI that supplied electronic guides and navigational software for the cable television market. The company later merged with Prevue Networks, then with TV Guide. TV Guide later merged with Gemstar International. The resulting Gemstar-TV Guide International was acquired in 2008 by Macrovision. Davis is chairman and CEO of Digimarc. He led Digimarc from start up in 1997 to a more than US$100 million public company supplying digital watermarking technologies to national and state governments and to the media industry. He has been chairman of the board since 2002. Davis has been awarded more than 50 patents on television user interface and media management and security. In 2003, Davis was named Ernst & Young's Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur Of The Year for the technology category.

Properties 4-Nitrophenol shows two polymorphs in the crystalline state. The alpha-form is colorless pillars, unstable at room temperature, and stable toward sunlight. The beta-form is yellow pillars, stable at room temperature, and gradually turns red upon irradiation of sunlight. Usually 4-nitrophenol exists as a mixture of these two forms. In solution, 4-nitrophenol has a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.15 at 25 ¬∞C. Uses =pH indicator= 4-Nitrophenol can be used as a pH indicator. A solution of 4-nitrophenol appears colorless below pH 5.4 and yellow above pH 7.5. This color-changing property makes this compound useful as a pH indicator. The yellow color of the 4-nitrophenolate form (or 4-nitrophenoxide) is due to a maximum of absorbance at 405 nm (Œµ = 18.3 to 18.4 mM‚àí1 cm‚àí1 in strong alkali). In contrast, 4-nitrophenol has a weak absorbance at 405 nm (Œµ = 0.2 mM‚àí1 cm‚àí1). The isosbestic point for 4-nitrophenol/4-nitrophenoxide is at 348 nm, with Œµ = 5.4 mM‚àí1 cm‚àí1. =Other uses= *4-Nitrophenol is an intermediate in the synthesis of paracetamol. It is reduced to 4-aminophenol, then acetylated with acetic anhydride. * 4-Nitrophenol is used as the precursor for the preparation of phenetidine and acetophenetidine, indicators, and raw materials for fungicides. Bioaccumulation of this compound rarely occurs. * In peptide synthesis, carboxylate ester derivatives of 4-nitrophenol may serve as activated components for construction of amide moieties. =Uses of derivatives= In the laboratory, it is used to detect the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity by hydrolysis of PNPP. In basic conditions, presence of hydrolytic enzymes will turn reaction vessel yellow. 4-Nitrophenol is a product of the enzymatic cleavage of several synthetic substrates such as 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (used as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase), 4-nitrophenyl acetate (for carbonic anhydrase), 4-nitrophenyl-Œ≤-D-glucopyranoside and other sugar derivatives which are used to assay various glycosidase enzymes. Amounts of 4-nitrophenol produced by a particular enzyme in the presence of its corresponding substrate can be measured with a spectrophotometer at or around 405 nm and used as a proxy measurement for the amount of the enzyme activity in the sample. Accurate measurement of enzyme activity requires that the 4-nitrophenol product is fully deprotonated, existing as 4-nitrophenolate, given the weak absorbance of 4-nitrophenol at 405 nm. Complete ionization of the alcohol functional group affects the conjugation of the pi bonds on the compound. A lone pair from the oxygen can be delocalized via conjugation to the benzene ring and nitro group. Since the length of conjugated systems affects the color of organic compounds, this ionization change causes the 4-nitrophenol to turn yellow when fully deprotonated and existing as 4-nitrophenolate. A common mistake in measuring enzyme activity using these substrates is to perform the assays at neutral or acidic pH without considering that only part of the chromophoric product is ionized. The problem can be overcome by stopping the reaction with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or other strong base, which converts all product into 4-nitrophenoxide; final pH must be > ca. 9.2 to ensure more than 99% of the product is ionised. Alternatively enzyme activity can be measured at 348 nm, the isosbestic point for 4-nitrophenol/4-nitrophenoxide. Toxicity 4-Nitrophenol irritates the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It may also cause inflammation of those parts. It has a delayed interaction with blood and forms methaemoglobin which is responsible for methemoglobinemia, potentially causing cyanosis, confusion, and unconsciousness. When ingested, it causes abdominal pain and vomiting. Prolonged contact with skin may cause allergic response. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of 4-nitrophenol are not known. The in mice is 282 mg/kg and in rats is 202 mg/kg (p.o.).

The film stars Imanol Arias, Ornella Muti and Loles Le√≥n. The film is a grotesque drama, with some elements of comedy. Set in Barcelona in the 1980s, El Amante Biling√ºe takes an ironic approach to Catalan linguistic policies, nationalism and eroticism with a pattern of double identity that was based on elements from the author's life. Plot Juan Mar√©s (an anagram of the author's name) is a Catalan man from a humble background, the son of a frustrated zarzuela seamstress and an illusionist known as Fu-Ching. He grew up in Barcelona during the 1950s, dreaming of leaving his poverty behind. In December 1970, he meets his future wife at a photographic exhibit, when he involves himself with a group organizing a four-day hunger strike to protest the verdict of the 1969 show trials in Burgos. There he meets Norma Valenti, the only daughter of a wealthy family of traditional and conservative Catalan background. In spite of economic, social and cultural differences between them, Juan and Norma get married. Norma works for the department of linguistics of the Generalitat regional government, while Juan (or Joan, his Catalan name) is overwhelmed by the social position acquired through the marriage. There is little use in Mar√©s‚Äô new life for his skills as ventriloquist or accordion player. After five years, the marriage starts to fall apart, when Norma‚Äôs real character surfaces. The beautiful Norma is proud and cold, with dark sexual tendencies. She has a special attraction for ‚Äúxarnegos‚Äù, lower-class migrants from other parts of Spain. Norma also has a shoe fetish and makes the men she sleeps with hold up a shoe with their erection. Returning home earlier than expected, Juan finds his wife having sex with a xarnego shoe shiner. Her infidelity revealed, Norma leaves her husband. Juan and Griselda live in Walden 7. The building's problem with falling tiles is shown in the film. Juan retains their apartment in Walden 7, but without his wife's financial support he must eke out a living by playing the accordion and busking for money in the streets of La Rambla. While performing on the streets, he is caught up in a confrontation between a pro-Catalan language group and some Francoist thugs. Juan plays Els Segadors, the national anthem of Catalonia, and the paramilitary extremists throw a Molotov cocktail at him. Disfigured in the explosion and his personality transformed by misfortune, Juan Mar√©s falls deeper into indigence and schizophrenic hallucinations. Obsessed with the happiness he has lost and with the memory of his wife, he encounters Norma while he is performing on the streets, but she fails to recognize him. In disguise, Mar√©s talks to her again during the carnival in Barcelona; only at the end of their talk does he impart a clue to his identity. Another day he telephones her, pretending to need help in the translation of words from Spanish into Catalan. His hallucinations increasing, a new identity takes shape in his mind: the emphatically non- Catalan Juan Faneca (the author's birth name). Faneca has a strong regional accent, a pencil mustache, dark complexion, sharp sideburns and eye patch. In this role he is a xarnego from Murcia and a childhood friend of Mar√©s, coming back to Barcelona after years supposedly living as a worker in Germany. Disguised as Faneca, Juan seduces his lonely neighbor, Griselda, an Andalusian widow who is embracing everything Catalan to start her new life in Barcelona. Their one-night stand leaves both Juan and Norma disappointed. By then the invented character of Juan Faneca has overtaken Mar√©s, and he continues his life with Griselda. Production Spanish director Vicente Aranda became well known in Spain in the 1980s for cinematic adaptations of literary works. He felt a close affinity with novelist Juan Mars√©; they had shared similar childhood experiences in their native Barcelona. Aranda had previously adapted two other Mars√© novels to the big screen ‚Äî La Muchacha de las Bragas de Oro and If They Tell You I Fell ‚Äî and in 1992 he wanted to make a third adaptation from a Mars√© novel. Aranda recalled, 'Juan Mars√© sent me the manuscript of the novel El Amante Biling√ºe, and I liked it. Andres Vicente G√≥mez, the producer, was not very eager to take on this project; he considered it too regional, very Catalan. In spite of it all, we made the film.'C√°nov√°s Belch√≠, Joaqu√≠n (ed.), Miradas Sobre el Cine de Vicente Aranda, Murcia: Universidad de Murcia, 2000, p. 69 Gomez says that he and Mars√© thought that Mario Camus was the most appropriate director to make the film. El Amante Biling√ºe, a co-production with Italy, had a budget of 164 million pesetas (then about $1.36 million USD or 1.04 million Euros).C√°nov√°s Belch√≠, Joaqu√≠n (ed.), Miradas Sobre el Cine de Vicente Aranda, Murcia: Universidad de Murcia, 2000, p. 70 Shot in Barcelona, it premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival, where it was well received. El Amante Biling√ºe was then released in Spain on 1 April 1993. Cast * Imanol Arias as Joan Mar√©s/Juan Faneca * Ornella Muti as Norma Valenti * Loles Le√≥n as Griselda * Javier Bardem as Shoeshiner * Joan Lluis Bozzo as Valls Verd√∫ * Blanca Apil√°nez as Carmen Imanol Arias was launched to star status in Spain by his work with Vicente Aranda in El Lute, a film that was a critical and commercial success. Arias came to see his role in El Amante Biling√ºe as a turning point in his career, a triumph after two years of relative inactivity.Perriam, Christopher, Stars and Masculinities in Spanish Cinema: From banderas to Bardem, Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 31 There are similarities between his own life and that of his character: he had a first failed marriage with a rich woman, and was an immigrant from modest background. He recalls that the role in El Amante Biling√ºe was an exciting challenge in that he had to play a character with dual personalities and different registers. El Amante Biling√ºe was co-produced with Italian investors, and the role of Norma was given to Ornella Muti, an Italian actress famous for her beauty. Muti first gained attention in the English-speaking world as the princess in Flash Gordon (1980). Here, she played the suggestive role of a wealthy woman with unusual sexual fantasies. Aranda recalled: 'I was very pleased with Ornella; she did as much as she could to adjust to the requirements of the film, but she is extremely beautiful, and perhaps, another less attractive actress might have better suited the dark tone of the film.'Vicente Aranda, 2006 Declaraci√≥n de Intenciones www.vicentearanda.es. In supporting roles are Javier Bardem, one of Spain‚Äôs best known actors, here in one of his first roles; and Loles Le√≥n, who had appeared in Pedro Almod√≥var's Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! and Aranda's La Pasi√≥n Turca (1994) and Libertarias (1996). Maribel Verd√∫ also has an uncredited role in El Amante Biling√ºe, as the 'violin girl'. Analysis El Amante Biling√ºe is a ruthless satire on Catalan linguistic policies, exacerbated by social and class differences. The film is a painful reflection on the human desire to be someone else. The film is clearly marked by its geographical context: the normalization of the Catalan language and the re-establishment of Catalonia as a strong national identity in the context of Spain as a nation.Perriam, Christopher, : Stars and Masculinities in Spanish Cinema: From banderas to Bardem, Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 30 Despite its support from the government of Catalonia, the film frames Catalanization comically, associating popular Catalan culture with xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and a rescue of self-identity that excludes others. The film portrays Norma (\\"Norma\\" also means \\"(linguistic) norm\\", \\"standard\\" in Catalan and Spanish), representing the intellectual force of Catalan government policies of linguistic change, as haughty, obsessive and cold, while Juan Mar√©s's disfigurement marks his alignment with the culture of his perfidious wife, whom he wants to regain sexually. The film does not escape the overblown qualities, thin characterization and inherent simplistic sexual politics of Mars√©'s novel. However, it skilfully points out the layered construction of a second identity, that of Juan Faneca, whose black cloak, wide-brimmed hat, scars and eyepatch stand for a grotesque masculine self- image of sexual predominance based on outmoded forms of seduction. What starts as an unbelievable adventure gradually develops into an ironic criticism of the dual social and linguistic policies of Catalonia. The film is a dark reflection about personal identity and alienation, through which Aranda is also able to make the viewer feel alienated. Aranda became known as a film director skillful in handling erotic scenes. In El Amante Biling√ºe, the director parodies such scenes, as in a scene in which Faneca and Norma turn and levitate to express their sexual ecstasy. Reception El Amante Biling√ºe enjoyed neither commercial nor critical success. According to Aranda, 'The film suffered from the producer's lack of enthusiasm, of which I was aware and which I tried to resolve. Producer G√≥mez, explained, ‚ÄúEl Amante Biling√ºe was liked neither by the public nor by the novelist, nor even by the actors who made it; I did not like it either. I also think that Aranda was not very happy with the film; nevertheless, we went on to make another movie together.‚ÄùC√°nov√°s Belch√≠, Joaqu√≠n (ed.), Miradas Sobre el Cine de Vicente Aranda, Murcia: Universidad de Murcia, 2000, p. 709 Aranda explained: 'I think I did not exaggerate enough. I should have used a cruder brush. Above all, I am not defending my own mistakes. I would have been more satisfied with the film if I had employed an uglier and more extreme style. It was a mistake to center the plot of the film in dialectic between two languages that were so close ‚Äî Catalan and Spanish. I stated often that the dialectic should have established between English and Spanish, which would have made the film more universal. The plot could have remained the same, just changing the scenery from Barcelona to Los Angeles or New York City and, instead of a xarnego, some other type of foreigner ‚Äî the rest working the same.' El Amante Biling√ºe and other Films Aranda often encodes his films with literary references rather than cinematic ones. He explained: 'I wanted to make cinematographic references to The Invisible Man and The Phantom of the Opera, with more subtle quotations of those film through the use of the right photography in an expressionist style, but that idea had to be sacrificed to photograph Ornella Muti beautifully.' Nevertheless, he went on to recall: 'My intention was to make a contemporary film, but with Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n in mind, and I almost made it. I should have taken things more to the extreme, but I have a tendency to moderation.' In its baroque and twisted elements, El Amante Biling√ºe is similar to the adaptations Aranda made of two of Mars√©‚Äôs novels, La Muchacha de las Bragas de Oro and Si Te Dicen Que Ca√≠. In its pattern of double identities, El Amante Biling√ºe resembles two other films by Aranda, Cambio de Sexo and La Pasi√≥n Turca: in Cambio de Sexo, a young man with gender dysphoria is driven by his desire to become a woman; in La Pasi√≥n Turca, a housewife with a placid life leaves her former identity behind in pursuit of a new persona with a Turkish lover. Awards and nominations The film was nominated for, but did not win, the 1994 Goya Award, for Best Adapted Screenplay. Home media release El Amante Biling√ºe is available on a Region 2 DVD. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. Extra items on the DVD include a press conference at the Montreal Film Festival, a making-of documentary and cast and crew galleries.

He is best known for his idealized impressionistic paintings of women and children in beach and garden settings, and romantic (usually retrospective) Americana scenes.  Early years  Dawson attended The Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, from 1980-1983. At Art Center he studied under Dan McCaw, Harry Carmean, Ted Youngkin, Eugene Fleary, and Valerie Winslow. Dawson also took extension courses at UCLA geared towards artists in which cadavers were dissected, so the artist would have complete and thorough knowledge of anatomy. After Art Center he entered the commercial art field and worked as a staff artist on He- Man and the Masters of the Universe, and She-Ra: Princess of Power (Filmation Associates, Reseda, California); G. I. Joe, Transformers, and Jem (Marvel Productions Ltd., Los Angeles, California); and Baltimore's Six Flags Power Plant theme park design (Landmark Entertainment, Hollywood, California).  Transition years: from commercial art to fine art  In 1985 he was invited to have his first one-man show at the Disney Gallery (Burbank, California). He continued his commercial work alongside his Gallery work until 1991 when he joined Cottage Gallery in Carmel, California. He joined several more galleries shortly thereafter including: Waterhouse Gallery, Santa Barbara, California (1992); Joan Baker‚Äôs Garden Gallery, Half Moon Bay, California (1992); and The Sunbird Gallery, Los Altos California (1994).  National exposure  In 2000 he signed an exclusive worldwide contract with Marco Fine Arts, (El Segundo, California). Marco introduced the Nation to Dawson‚Äôs work by publishing his original paintings as limited edition serigraphs. In addition, Dawson‚Äôs art was promoted in a national tour in which it was also showcased at the New York Art Expo, Atlanta Art Expo, and San Francisco Art Expo. All of the original Marco editions have sold out.  International exposure: original art and limited editions in demand  In 2002 the entire fleet of ships in the Princess Cruise Lines began exhibiting and selling Dawson‚Äôs art on all their onboard art galleries, and in so doing a base of international collectors began to grow and acquire his work. In 2005 (with his international market continuing to expand) he started his affiliation with the exclusive Barry Chappell‚Äôs Fine Art Showcase, a national television show that is transmitted to 50 million homes three times a week. Dawson regularly appears live on the show, and is one of only six artists that Mr. Chappell interviews on a regular basis. In addition, Dawson was one of only four artists to be featured on Master‚Äôs Month two years in a row (2005 and 2006). Dawson is the only living impressionist they represent.  Artistic style and themes  His paintings and prints are distinguished by his loyalty to the Impressionistic ideals, and to the American Scene Painters of the early 1900s. His subject matter is often romantic, sentimental, or nostalgic. Almost all his early paintings were of his childhood, childhood memories, or contemporary family life. Since the early nineties he has expanded his subject matter to include American genre scenes. There is also an emphasis on candid and casual moments with very little affectation. Posed and or staged subjects are avoided for the most part. Dawson says he wants his art to offer order, clarification, focus, and escape from a chaotic world filled with conflict without resolution.

He predominantly plays organ, piano and bass guitar. Career In 1960 he joined a group called The Paramounts as a guitarist but left in December 1962 to go to study chemistry at Leicester University. Diz Derrick replaced him in the group until they split up in October 1966. From 1963 until 1966 he studied at Leicester University, receiving an honours degree in chemistry. From 1966 to 1969, he worked for the government and studied for a PhD. During this time his first marriage had broken up and he had returned to playing music, initially playing the organ in a pub, then playing traditional German music. In 1969, he was invited by Robin Trower to replace Matthew Fisher on organ and David Knights on bass in Procol Harum (at which point that band consisted entirely of ex-The Paramounts musicians). Between December 1969 and March 1977 Copping recorded seven albums with the group and toured extensively. During this time Copping alternated between bass guitar and Hammond organ as other musicians joined the group. After recording the album, Something Magic, he left the group and was replaced by Dee Murray for the accompanying tour, after which the group broke up. In 1978 he moved to Australia where he continues to play and compose. In recent years Copping has worked with artists such as Mark Hilton, JoJo Leslie and Astrid Munday, as well as composing music for a number of short films (Miss Fortune, The Web and Slim Pickings).

The post was established by Major Edward Banker Willis in December 1863 FortWiki at Del Rio Springs just north of today's Chino Valley, Arizona. He led Companies C and F of the 1st California Volunteers and built the post under General Order #27 issued by General James Henry Carleton. The post was named Fort Whipple after Amiel Weeks Whipple, a Civil War military officer and topographical engineer. He served as a brigadier general and was mortally wounded on May 7, 1863 at the Battle of Chancellorsville in Virginia. On May 18, 1864 Fort Whipple was moved 21 miles south to a miner's tent settlement on the east bank of Granite Creek called Granite City (also Granite Dells, Gimletville), which was on higher ground, had better access to lumber, and the military could better protect miners. The relocation of the fort was recommended by Governor Goodwin. Prescott (approximately two miles west of the fort) was designated as the capital of the Arizona Territory, replacing the temporary capital at Fort Whipple. The old site at Del Rio Springs continued to be used by scouting parties and was called Camp Clark, in honor of John A. Clark, Surveyor General of the New Mexico Territory. Fort Whipple served as a tactical base for detachments of several regiments involved in the American Indian Wars between 1864 and 1886. The fort became headquarters of the Military Department of Arizona between 1870 and 1886. From May 1885 to July 1886, Fort Whipple was home to Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson and Troop B of the 10th Cavalry Regiment (United States), also known as Buffalo Soldiers. Between 1869 and 1872, the old fort stockade was razed and the majority of new construction occurred up until 1877. The depot, renamed Prescott Barracks in 1878 was merged with Fort Whipple in 1879, and was renamed Whipple Barracks. By 1895, Fort Whipple was dilapidated and in 1897 it was scheduled for deactivation. When the United States declared war on Spain in April 1898, the U.S. Army designated Whipple Barracks to be a point of muster for the Arizona volunteers and reopened on April 29, 1898. 200 volunteers were recruited, called the ‚ÄúArizona Cowboy Regiment‚Äù, they departed on May 4 to assemble in San Antonio, Texas. Officially called the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, they were nicknamed the Rough Riders and fought in Cuba. The fort was inactive between 1899 and 1902, then reactivated in April 1902 with plans to rebuild the post. New buildings, barracks and quarters were constructed and completed by 1908. Four companies (about 500 soldiers) moved in. When Arizona became a state in 1912, the fort was determined to be obsolete and troops were relocated to larger forts. Fort Whipple was placed in caretaker status and managed by a small maintenance crew. In 1918 during World War I, the Army reactivated Fort Whipple as U.S. Army General Hospital #20. The hospital was designated for treatment of soldiers with respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (TB) and those injured by nerve gas. It had 22 buildings with plans for up to 1,100 beds. In 1920, the property was loaned to the U.S. Public Health Service and operated under a permit from the War Department. The hospital continued its mission to treat soldiers and veterans with respiratory illnesses. On April 29, 1922, Executive Order 3669 was signed which then transferred the permit and functions of the hospital to the newly established U.S. Veterans Bureau (Hospital #50, Whipple Barracks, Arizona). In 1931, the U.S. Veterans Bureau was consolidated to become the Veterans Administration (VA) (renamed United States Department of Veterans Affairs in March 1989). In 2004, it was renamed the Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, after Congressman Stump, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Today, known as the Northern Arizona VA Health Care System, the campus retains over twenty of the buildings built during the reconstruction period of 1905 to 1908. The buildings on the hill originally served as the officers quarters, then served as homes to staff of the hospital for many years. The Department of Veterans Affairs has plans to renovate these former quarters to become useful in providing Veterans with additional healthcare services. Fort Whipple Museum and other historic structures Pictured is one of the military officer's quarters (Building 11, painted yellow and green) which has been turned into the Fort Whipple Museum, with artifacts and history about the fort and hospital, including medical instruments, Army weaponry, the Buffalo Soldiers, maps, photographs and memoirs written by those stationed there.

Background Marion Coyle was born on July 1954 in Derry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and lived in the Duncreggan Road, a rather middle-class and fashionable area of Derry. Coyle was a student in typing and advanced English at the time of the civil rights demonstrations and civil disorder which culminated in the Battle of the Bogside. In his work, Hostage:Notorious Irish Kidnappings, Paul Howard notes that Coyle was a very quiet teenager \\"showing none of the qualities that would make her one of the IRA's most fearless and respected Volunteers.Howard p.132 On the night of 26 June 1970 her uncle Joe Coyle, who was a member of the IRA's Derry leadership, along with Thomas Carlin, Tommy McCool and his two young daughters died when a bomb they were preparing in the kitchen of Tommy McCool's house on the Creggan estate exploded prematurely.Howard p.134 Following this, her brother Phillip was arrested and imprisoned for possession of a firearm. In 1973 Coyle and three others were arrested in Sligo after they were stopped in a car containing guns and ammunition. The alleged IRA Northern OC, Leo Martin was charged in relation to the incident.Howard p.135 In 1974 Coyle was acquitted of the attempted murder of a Garda officer during the re-arrest of Kevin Mallon in Portlaoise (Mallon had been one of three IRA prisoners airlifted to safety in the 1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape).  Monasterevin Siege  On 3 October 1975 Coyle and another IRA member, Eddie Gallagher, kidnapped industrialist Tiede Herrema near his home in Castletroy, a suburb of Limerick. They were traced to a house in Monasterevin, County Kildare, and a two-week siege began. Coyle and Gallagher demanded the release of three republican prisoners, including Rose Dugdale, in return for the release of Herrema, but the authorities refused to grant any concessions. The siege ended on 7 November when Herrema was released, and Coyle and Gallagher were arrested. The kidnapping was the longest in Irish history. In March 1976 Coyle was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the abduction, while Gallagher received a 20-year sentence. Herrema has stated he believes the sentences were too long, describing Coyle and Gallagher as young people who did something stupid. Coyle was released from prison in 1985, and Gallagher in 1990.

It was invented by British hairdresser and amateur chemist Maurice Ward (1933-2011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received significant publicity after coverage of the material aired in 1990 on the BBC science and technology show Tomorrow's World. The name Starlite was coined by Ward's granddaughter Kimberly. The American company Thermashield, LLC claims to have acquired the rights to Starlite in 2013 and replicated it.Thermashield, \\"News\\", \\"News\\", July 2019 It is the only company to have itself publicly demonstrated the technology and have samples tested by third parties.Thermashield, \\"News\\", \\"Aerospace Validation\\", November 2019 Properties Under tests, Starlite was claimed to be able to withstand attack by a laser beam that could produce a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. Live demonstrations on Tomorrow's World and BBC Radio 4 showed that an egg coated in Starlite could remain raw, and cold enough to be picked up with a bare hand, even after five minutes in the flame of a blowtorch. It would also prevent a blowtorch from damaging a human hand. When heat is applied, the material chars, which creates an expanding low density foam of carbon which is very thermally resistant. Former Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence Sir Ronald Mason noted, \\"This is really the most remarkable material\\". Materials scientist Mark Miodownik described Starlite as a type of intumescent paint, and one of the materials he would most like to see for himself. He also admitted some doubt about the commercial potential of Starlite. NASA engineer Rosendo ‚ÄòRudy‚Äô Naranjo said of their discussions with Ward, \\"We have done a lot of evaluation and ...we know all the tremendous possibilities that this material has.\\" Drawbacks are the need to have a very high temperature or flame to start the reaction and form the insulation layer, so low temperature insulation needs to be proven, as well as testing thermal conductivity and capacity in different conditions. Contamination with dust residue may occur, and so slow degradation with use. Its main use appears to be as a flame retardant. Advances in mechanical property such as composite material association needed to be done to extend the applications. Composition Starlite's composition is a closely guarded secret, but it is said to contain a variety of organic polymers and co-polymers with both organic and inorganic additives, including borates and small quantities of ceramics and other special barrier ingredients‚Äîup to 21 in all. Perhaps uniquely for a material claimed to be thermal proof, it is claimed to be not entirely inorganic but up to 90 percent organic. Nicola McDermott, Ward's youngest daughter, stated that Starlite is 'natural' and edible, and that it has been fed to dogs and horses without ill effects. The American company Thermashield, which owns the Starlite formula, stated in a radio interview that Starlite is not made from household ingredients and there is no PVA glue, baking soda or baking powder in it. Commercialisation Ward allowed various organisations such as the Atomic Weapons Establishment and ICI to conduct tests on samples, but did not permit them to retain samples for fear of reverse engineering. Ward maintained that his invention was worth billions. NASA became involved in Starlite in 1994, and NASA representative Rudy Naranjo talked about its potential in a Dateline NBC report. The Dateline announcer said that maybe Starlite could help with the fragile Space Shuttle heat shield. Boeing, which was the main contractor for the Space Shuttles, became interested in 1994, in the potential of Starlite to eliminate flammable materials in their jets. By the time of his death, there appeared to have been no commercialisation of Starlite, and the formulation of the material has not been released to the public. According to a 2016 broadcast of the BBC programme The Naked Scientists, Ward took his secrets with him when he died. Claimed Replication A YouTube user NightHawkInLight attempted to create materials that replicate the properties of Starlite in 2018. Observing that the mechanism that generates an expanding carbon foam in Starlite is similar to black snake fireworks, NightHawkInLight concocted a formula using cornstarch, baking soda, and PVA glue. After drying, the hardened material creates a small layer of carbon foam on the surface when exposed to high heat, insulating the material from further heat transfer. Several tests made with the replication and variant recipe can handle lasers, thermite, torch, etc. But the replication failed to make a crucible for an induction furnace. Thermashield's Starlite has successfully passed Femtosec Laser testing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ASTM D635-15 Standard Testing.

Throughout the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War from 1979‚Äì1989, and subsequent civil war (1989‚Äì1992) the city of Kabul saw little fighting. The collapse of Mohammad Najibullah's regime in April 1992 led to a peace treaty between the Afghan political parties. But soon after, the undisciplined commanders from both former mujahideen and Communist ranks started to vie for power, abetted by foreign powers, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Uzbekistan, who began arming their Afghan proxies to fight for control and influence. Political background With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet-supported government of Najibullah lost credibility. In 1992, Russia agreed to end fuel shipments to Afghanistan, which triggered the collapse of Najibullah's regime. In April 1992, General Abdul Rashid Dostum defected to the forces of Ahmed Shah Massoud, and began to take control of Kabul. By April 14, 1992, Massoud and his forces took control of Charikar and Jabalussaraj in Parwan province without significant fighting.Corwin, Phillip. Doomed in Afghanistan: A U.N. Officer's memoir of the Fall of Kabul and Najibullah's Failed Escape. 1992. Rutgers University Press. (31 January 2003), 70 At this point, it was reported that Massoud had approximately 20,000 troops stationed around Kabul.Doomed in Afghanistan, 71 It was also reported that the government's Second Division had joined Massoud. General Mohammad Nabil Azimi then proceeded to reinforce Bagram Air Base, and sent further reinforcements to the outer perimeter of Kabul. By mid-April, the air force command at Bagram capitulated to Massoud. With no army to defend it, Kabul had become completely helpless.The Fall of Kabul, April 1992, Library of Congress country studies As soon as he announced his willingness, on March 18, to resign in order to make way for a neutral interim government, Najibullah immediately lost control. As the government broke into several factions, the issue was how to carry out a transfer of power to a new government. Najibullah attempted to flee from Kabul on April 17, but was stopped by Dostum's troops, who controlled Kabul International Airport. Najibullah then took refuge at the United Nations mission where he remained until 1995. A group of Parchami generals and officials declared themselves an interim government for the purpose of handing over power to the dominant and most popular military force: Massoud. Massoud hesitated to enter Kabul, waiting for the political parties to reach a peace and power-sharing agreement first. In April 1992, the Peshawar Accord was signed. It stipulated that an interim government would be formed with a supreme leadership council. A transitory presidency was given to Sibghatullah Mojaddedi for two months, after which Burhanuddin Rabbani was to succeed him. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was given the post of prime minister, but he did not accept this position as he did not want to share power and Pakistan was urging him to take power for himself. Massoud, in a recorded conversation, tried to convince Hekmatyar to join the peace agreement and not to enter Kabul. But Hekmatyar replied he would enter the capital with \\"our naked sword. No-one can stop us\\". Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami forces began to infiltrate Kabul. This forced Massoud to advance on the capital in order to preserve the Peshawar Accord and prevent the establishment of a Hekmatyar dictatorship. Different Mujahideen groups entered Kabul from different directions. Hezb-i Islami made the first move and entered the city from the south. With soldiers armed and financed by Pakistan, Hekmatyar had asked other groups such as Harakat-Inqilab-i-Islami and the Khalis faction to join him while entering Kabul, but they declined his offer and instead backed the Peshawar Accord. Jamiat-i Islami had seized massive amount of weapons while overrunning the Communist garrisons in Bagram, Charikar, Takhar, Kunduz, Fayzabad and other northern cities. Adding to that, all the forces of Junbish-i Milli had aligned themselves to the Jamiat, and the former Communist government of Afghanistan had decided to surrender all its weapons to Jamiat, instead of Hezb. All the Parchamis had fled abroad through the Jamiat-controlled areas. Jamiat had seized massive stockpiles of heavy weapons such as T-62 and T-55 tanks, Scud missiles and MiG-21s. Hekmatyar's Hezb forces were very far from key points of the city such as the presidential palace, the prime minister's office, Kabul International Airport, the ministry of defense and many other important government offices. Much of the city lies on the North Bank of the Kabul River. Burhanuddin Rabbani's Jamiat forces quickly took control of these strategically important offices. Although Hezb forces got to the gates of the ministry of justice and took control of the ministry of the interior, they were quickly repulsed after bombing from the Afghan Air Force, which was supported by artillery shells fired from a TV tower onto Jade Maiwand. Hundreds of Hezb fighters were killed or taken prisoners, including some foreign fighters. In the western sector of the city, the Hezb forces crossed the Kabul River and arrived at the northern bank after taking control of the Karte Seh area. While charging towards the Kote Sangi and Kabul University, Sayyaf's forces attacked Hezb forces from the Ghazi School area in a surprise move, and the Hezb forces were separated into two groups after being cut off by Jamiat troops. Throughout the night, the exhausted and demoralized forces of Hezbi Islami fought. After suffering heavy casualties, Hezb forces on the southern bank deserted their positions, fleeing out of Kabul towards Logar. Kabul came completely under Islamic State control on April 30, 1992, but the situation was far from stabilised. The Hezb-i Islami had been driven out, but they were still within artillery range, and soon started firing tens of thousands of Pakistan-supplied rockets into the city. When Hekmatyar's forces had overrun Pul-e-Charkhi prison, while still in the centre of Kabul, they had set free all the inmates, including many criminals who were able to take arms and commit gruesome actions against the population.De Ponfilly, p. 405 With the government institutions either collapsing or participating in the factional fighting, maintaining order in Kabul became almost impossible. The scene was set for the next phase of the war. Timeline =1992= April‚ÄìMay Control in Kabul in April 1992 The immediate objective of the interim government was to defeat the forces acting against the peace agreement (the Peshawar Accord), particularly Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami (backed by Pakistan) but later to include Mazari's Wahdat (backed by Iran) and Dostum's Junbish (backed by Uzbekistan). The forces of Jamiat and Shura-e Nazar entered the city, with agreement from Nabi Azimi and the commander of the Kabul garrison, General Abdul Wahid Baba Jan, that they would enter the city through Bagram, Panjshir, Salang and Kabul Airport.Afghanistan Justice Project. \\"Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, 1978‚Äì2001.\\" 2005.

But the situation was far from stabilized. The Hezb-i Islami had been driven out, but they were still within artillery range, and soon started firing tens of thousands of rockets into the city. Fighting between Hezb-i Islami and Junbish occurred in the Shashdarak area of Kabul. On May 5‚Äì6, 1992, Hizb-i Islami subjected Kabul to a heavy artillery bombardment, killing and injuring an unknown number of civilians. On May 23, 1992, despite a cease-fire, the forces of Junbish-i Milli bombarded Hizb-i Islami positions in Bini Hissar, Kalacha and Kart-iNau. Peace talks on May 25, 1992, originally agreed to give Hekmatyar the position of prime minister. However, this lasted less than a week after Hekmatyar had attempted to shoot down the plane of President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi.Human Rights Watch. \\"Blood Stained Hands: Past atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity.\\" 2005. Accessed at: www.hrw.org/reports/2005/afghanistan0605/afghanistan0605.pdf [Accessed on 22 November 2009], 22 Furthermore, as part of the peace talks, Hekmatyar was demanding the departure of Dostum's forces, which would have tilted the scales. On May 30, 1992, during fighting between the forces of Junbish-i Milli and Hizb-i Islami in the southeast of Kabul, both sides used artillery and rockets killing and injuring an unknown number of civilians. Shura-e Nazar forces were said to have been around the customs post on Jalalabad Road under the command of Gul Haidar and Baba Jalandar, who also were active in the areas such as the military university. June‚ÄìJuly In June 1992, as scheduled, Burhanuddin Rabbani became President of Afghanistan. From the onset of the battle, Jamiat and Shura-e Nazar controlled the strategic high areas, and were thus able to develop a vantage point within the city from which opposition forces could be targeted. Hekmatyar continued to bombard Kabul with rockets. Although Hekmatyar insisted that only Islamic Jihad Council areas were targeted, the rockets mostly fell over the houses of innocent civilians of Kabul, a fact which has been well-documented.Afghanistan Justice Project. \\"Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, 1978‚Äì2001.\\" 2005. Accessed at: http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/ [Accessed on 10 November 2009] Artillery exchanges quickly broke out, escalating in late May- early June. Shura-i Nazar was able to immediately benefit from heavy weapons left by fleeing or defecting government forces and launched rockets on Hekmatyar's positions near the Jalalabad Customs Post, and in the districts around Hood Khil, Qala-e Zaman Khan and near Pul-i Charkhi prison. On June 10, it was reported that Dostum's forces had also begun nightly bombardments of Hezb-i Islami positions.Jamilurrahman, Kamgar. ‚ÄúHavadess-e Tarikhi-e Afghanistan 1990‚Äì1997. Peshawar: Markaz-e Nashrati (Meyvand, 2000) pp. 66‚Äì68 translation by Human Rights Watch. Particularly noticeable in this period was the escalation of the fight in West Kabul between the Shi‚Äôa Wahdat forces supported by Iran and those of the Wahhabist Ittihad militia supported by Saudi Arabia. Wahdat was somewhat nervous about the presence of Ittihad posts which were deployed in Hazara areas such as Rahman Baba High school. According to reports by Nabi Azimi, who at the time was a high ranking governor, the fighting began on May 31, 1992, when four members of Hezb-e Wahdat's leadership were assassinated near the Kabul Silo. Those killed were Karimi, Sayyid Isma‚Äôil Hosseini, Chaman Ali Abuzar and Vaseegh, the first three being members of the party's central committee. Following this, the car of Haji Shir Alam, a top Ittihad commander, was stopped near Pol-e Sorkh, and although Alem escaped, one of the passengers was killed.Mohammaed Nabi Azimi, ‚ÄúOrdu va Siyasat.‚Äù p. 606. On June 3, 1992, heavy fighting between forces of Ittihad-i Islami and Hizb-I Wahdat in West Kabul broke out. Both sides used rockets, killing and injuring civilians. On June 4, interviews with Hazara households stated that Ittihad forces looted their houses in Kohte-e Sangi, killing six civilians. The gun battles at this time had a death toll of over 100 according to some sources.Sharon Herbaugh, ‚ÄúPro-Government militias intervene as fighting continues in Kabul,‚Äù Associated Press, June 5, 1992. On June 5, 1992, further conflicts between forces of Ittihad and Hizb-i Wahdat in West Kabul were reported. Here, both sides used heavy artillery, destroying houses and other civilian structures. Three schools were reportedly destroyed by bombardment, and an unknown number of civilians were injured or killed. Gunmen were reported killing people in shops near the Kabul Zoo. On 24 June 1992, the Jamhuriat hospital located near the interior ministry was bombed and closed. Jamiat and Shura-e Nazar forces sometimes joined the conflict when their positions came under attack by Wahdat forces and in June and July bombarded Hizb-i Wahdat positions in return. Harakat forces also sometimes joined the fight. August‚ÄìDecember In the month of August, a bombardment of artillery shells, rockets and fragmentation bombs killed over 2,000 people in Kabul, most of them civilians. On August 1 the airport was attacked by rockets. One- hundred and fifty rockets were launched the following day, and according to one author, these missile attacks killed as many as 50 people and injured 150. In the early morning on August 10 Hezb-e Islami forces attacked from three directions ‚Äì Chelastoon, Darulaman and Maranjan mountain. A shell also struck a Red Cross hospital. On April 10‚Äì11 nearly a thousand rockets hit parts of Kabul including about 250 hits on the airport. Some estimate that as many as 1000 were killed, with the attacks attributed to Hekmatyar's forces. By August 20 it was reported that 500, 000 people had fled Kabul.Philip Bruno, ‚ÄúLa seconde bataille de Kaboul ‚Äòle gouvernment ne contr√¥le plus rien,‚Äú Le Monde, August 20, 1992. On August 13, 1992, a rocket attack was launched on Deh Afghanan in which cluster bombs were used. Eighty were killed and more than 150 injured, according to press reports. In response to this, Shura-e Nazar forces hit Kart-I Naw, Shah Shaheed and Chiilsatoon with aerial and ground bombardment. In this counterattack, more than 100 were killed and 120 wounded.Human Rights Watch. \\"Blood Stained Hands.‚Äù Hezb-i Islami was not, however, the only perpetrator of indiscriminate shelling of civilians. Particularly in West Kabul, Wahdat, Ittihad and Jamiat all have been accused of deliberately targeting civilian areas. All sides used non-precision rockets such as Sakre rockets and the UB-16 and UB-32 S-5 airborne rocket launchers. In November, in a very effective move, Hekmatyar's forces, together with guerrillas from some of the Arab groups, barricaded a power station in Sarobi, 30 miles east of Kabul, cutting electricity to the capital and shutting down the water supply, which is dependent on power. His forces and other Mujahideen were also reported to have prevented food convoys from reaching the city. On November 23, Minister of Food Sulaiman Yaarin reported that the city's food and fuel depots were empty. The government was now under heavy pressure. At the end of 1992 Hizb-i Wahdat officially withdrew from the government and opened secret negotiations with Hizb-I Islami. In December 1992, Rabbani postponed convening a shura to elect the next president. On December 29, 1992, Rabbani was elected as president and he agreed to establish a parliament with representatives from all of Afghanistan. Also notable during this month was the solidification of an alliance between Hezb-i Wahdat and Hezb-i Islami against the Islamic State of Afghanistan. While Hizb-i Islami joined in bombardments to support Wahdat, Wahdat conducted joint offensives, such as the one to secure Darulaman.Afghanistan Justice Project, 71 On December 30, 1992, at least one child was apparently killed in Pul-i Artan by a BM21 rocket launched from Hezb-i Islami forces at Rishkor.Afghanistan Justice Project, 76 About the bombardments Abdul Rashid Dostum, leader of Junbish-i-Milli Islami Afghanistan Throughout the war, the most devastating aspect of it remained the indiscriminate shelling of the city by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and later Rashid Dostum. Although most sides engaged in bombardments, some were more indiscriminate in their targeting. As Jamiat-i controlled the strategic high areas, they were better able to target specific military objectives rather than resorting to indiscriminate shelling as other factions such as Hezb-i Islami had done. According to the officer, the 3rd Regiment deployed in the Darulaman area, where Wahdat Corps had based their artillery commander, as well as the area near the Russian Embassy where Wahdat's Division 096, were particularly targeted by the long ranged rockets. Charasyab, which housed Hizb-i Islami's artillery, Shiwaki, where the intelligence department was deployed and the Rishkor Division were also targeted, in addition to the Dasht-I Saqawa airport in Logar Province.Afghanistan Justice Project. \\"Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, 1978‚Äì2001.\\" 2005. Accessed at: http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/ [Accessed on 10 November 2009], 67 By far the worst perpetrator of attacks against non-military targets were the forces of Hizb-i Islami. These included attacks against hospitals and a bombing attack on the headquarters of the International Red Cross. There was general indiscriminate bombing starting in August. In 1994 the forces of Rashid Dostum were involved in indiscriminate shelling. Kandahar at the same time Kandahar was filled with three different local Pashtun commanders Amir Lalai, Gul Agha Sherzai and Mullah Naqib Ullah who engaged in an extremely violent struggle for power and who were not affiliated with the interim government in Kabul. The bullet-riddled city came to be a center of lawlessness, crime, and atrocities fuelled by complex Pashtun tribal rivalries. =1993= January‚ÄìFebruary On January 3, 1993, Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader of the Jamiat-i Islami Party, was sworn in as president. However, Rabbani's authority remained limited to only part of Kabul; the rest of the city remained divided among rival militia factions. On January 19, a short-lived cease-fire broke down when Hezb-i Islami forces renewed rocket attacks on Kabul from their base in the south of the city supervised by Commander Toran Kahlil.Afghanistan Justice Project, 67 Hundreds were killed and wounded while many houses were destroyed in this clash between Hizb-i Islami and Jamiat-i Islami. Heavy fighting was reported around a Wahdat post held by Commander Sayid Ali Jan near Rabia Balkhi girls' school. Most notable during this period was the rocket bombardments which would start against the residential area of Afshar. Some of these areas, such as Wahdat's headquarters at the Social Science Institute, were considered military targets, a disproportionate number of the rockets, tank shells and mortars fell in civilian areas.Afghanistan Justice Project, 77 Numerous rockets were reportedly launched from Haider-controlled frontlines of Tap-I Salaam towards the men of Division 095 under Ali Akbar Qasemi. One attack during this time from Wahdat killed at least nine civilians.Afghanistan Justice Project, 78 Further rockets bombardments took place on February 26, 1993, as Shura-e Nazar and Hezb-i Islami bombarded each other's positions. Civilians were the main victims in the fighting which killed some 1,000 before yet another peace accord was signed on March 8. However the following day rocketing by Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and Hezb-i Wahdat in Kabul left another 10 dead.Afghanistan Justice Project, 79 Afshar See the main article for more information: The Afshar Operation was a military operation by Burhanuddin Rabbani's Islamic State of Afghanistan government forces against Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and Hezb-i Wahdat forces that took place in February 1993. The Iran-controlled Hezb-i Wahdat together with the Pakistani-backed Hezb-i Islami of Hekmatyar were shelling densely populated areas in Kabul from their positions in Afshar. To counter these attack Islamic State forces attacked Afshar in order to capture the positions of Wahdat, capture Wahdat's leader Abdul Ali Mazari and to consolidate parts of the city controlled by the government. The operation took place in a densely populated district of Kabul, the Afshar District. The Afshar District is situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar in West Kabul. The district is predominantly home to the Hazara ethnic group. The Ittihad troops of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf escalated the operation into a rampage against civilians. Both Ittihad and Wahdat forces severely targeted civilians in the war. The Wahhabist Ittihad supported by Saudi Arabia was targeting Shias, while the Iran-controlled Wahdat was targeting Sunni Muslims as well as their own people. March‚ÄìDecember Under the March accord, brokered by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Rabbani and Hekmatyar agreed to share power until elections could be held in late 1994. Hekmatyar's condition had been the resignation of Massoud as minister of defense. The parties agreed to a new peace accord in Jalalabad on May 20 under which Massoud agreed to relinquish the post of defense minister. Massoud had resigned in order to gain peace. Hekmatyar at first accepted the post of prime minister but after attending only one cabinet meeting he left Kabul again starting to bomb Kabul leaving more than 700 dead in bombing raids, street battles and rocket attacks in and around Kabul. Massoud returned to the position of minister of defense to defend the city against the rocket attacks. =1994= January‚ÄìJune The war changed dramatically in January 1994. Dostum, for different reasons, joined with the forces of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Hezb-i Islami, along with their new allies of Wahdat and Junbish-i Milli, launched the Shura Hamaghangi campaign against the forces of Massoud and the interim government. During this, Hezb-i Islami was able make use of Junbish's air force in both bombing the positions of Jamiat and in resupplying their men. This led to greater artillery bombardment on behalf of Hezb-i Islami. Hezb-i Islami and Junbish were able to hold parts of central Kabul during this time. Junbish forces were particularly singled out for committing looting, rape and murder.Afghanistan Justice Project, 105 Some commanders such as Shir Arab, commander of the 51st Regiment,Afghanistan Justice Project Kasim Jangal Bagh, Ismail Diwaneh [‚ÄúIsmail the Mad‚Äù], and Abdul CherikwereHuman Right's Watch particularly singled out. According to the Afghanistan Justice Project, during this period until June 1994, 25,000 people were killed. Areas around Microraion were particularly bloody. By now the population of Kabul had dropped from 2,000,000 during Soviet times to 500,000 due to a large exodus from Kabul. However, by the end of 1994 Junbish and Dostum were on the defensive, and Massoud's forces had ousted them from most of their strongholds. Massoud more and more gained control of Kabul. At the same time, Junbish was able to push Jamiat out of Mazar-e Sharif. July‚ÄìDecember Significant changes occurred in 1994 in how the war was conducted and who fought which side. The Taliban movement first emerged on the military scene in August 1994, with the stated goal of liberating Afghanistan from its present corrupt leadership of warlords and establishing a pure Islamic society. By October 1994, the Taliban movement had attracted the support of Pakistan, which was unhappy with the unsuccessful Hekmatyar, which saw in the Taliban a way to secure trade routes to Central Asia and establish a government in Kabul friendly to its interests. Pakistani traders who had long sought a secure route to send their goods to Central Asia quickly became some of the Taliban's strongest financial backers. The Pakistanis also wished for a stable government to take hold in Afghanistan, regardless of ideology, in hopes that the 3 million Afghans who for 15 years had taken refuge in Pakistan would return to their homeland since the refugee population became increasingly viewed as a burden. In October 1994, a bomb struck a wedding ceremony in Qala Fathullah in Kabul, killing 70 civilians. No fighting had been witnessed in the area in several days according to reports.Amnesty International. \\"Women in Afghanistan: A Human Rights Catastrophe.\\" 1994 Accessed at: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/003/1995/en/ Also in October 1994, the Taliban revolted in Kandahar, capturing the city on November 5, 1995, and soon going on to capture most of the south. =1995= The Taliban soon began to approach Kabul, capturing Wardak in early February and Maidshahr, the provincial capital on February 10, 1995. On February 14, 1995, Hekmatyar was forced to abandon his artillery positions at Charasiab due to the advance of the Taliban. The Taliban were therefore able to take control of this weaponry. In March, Massoud launched an offensive against Hezb-e Wahdat. Mazari allied himself with the Taliban, allowing them to enter Kabul, although many of Wahdat's forces joined Massoud instead. Massoud's forces heavily bombarded Western Kabul driving Wahdat out. According to other reports the forces of Jamiat-e Islami also committed mass rape and executions on civilians in this period.Afghanistan Justice Project, 63 The Taliban retreated under this, taking Mazari with them and throwing him from a helicopter en route to Kandahar. The Taliban then continued to launch offensives against Kabul, using the equipment of Hezbe Islami. While the Taliban retreated, large amounts of looting and pillaging was said to have taken place in South-western Kabul by the forces under Rabbani and Massoud.U.S. Department of State. \\"Afghanistan Human Rights Practices, 1995.\\" March 1996. Accessed at: http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1995_hrp_report/95hrp_report_sasia/Afghanistan.html In March 1995, Massoud's forces were able to drive out the Taliban from the area around Kabul, and retake Charasiab, leading to a relative period of calm for a few months. The battle left hundreds of Taliban dead and the force suffered its first defeat. In October the Taliban retook Charasiab. Between November 11‚Äì13, 1995, at least 57 unarmed civilians were killed and over 150 injured when rockets and artillery barrages fired from Taleban positions south of Kabul pounded the civilian areas of the city. On November 11, 36 civilians were killed when over 170 rockets as well as shells hit civilians areas. A salvo crashed into Foruzga Market. Rockets struck the Taimani District where many people from other parts of Kabul had settled. Other residential areas hit by artillery and rocket attacks were the Bagh Bala District in the northwest of Kabul and Wazir Akbar Khan where much of the city's small foreign community live.Amnesty International. \\"Afghanistan: Further Information on Fear For Safety and New Concern: Deliberate and Arbitrary Killings: Civilians in Kabul.\\" 16 November 1995 Accessed at: On November 20, 1995, the forces of the Taliban gave the government a five-day ultimatum after which they would resume bombardment if Rabbani and his forces did not leave the city. This ultimatum was eventually withdrawn. By the end of November and December, more than 150 people had died in Kabul due to the repeated rocketing, shelling, and high- altitude bombing of the city, reportedly by Taliban forces. =1996= In September 1996 the Taliban returned to seize Kabul.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Afghanistan. ¬ß5.6 Burgeroorlog\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. In its first action, the Islamic militant group publicly hanged former president, Najibullah, and his brother, perceiving them to be puppets loyal to nations other than Afghanistan. All key government installations appeared to be in the Taliban's hands within hours, including the presidential palace and the ministries of defense, security and foreign affairs. A rigidly strict version of Sharia was imposed upon the population. Massoud's militia and other groups decided to retreat to the north to reduce civilian casualties. The United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, a coalition of various armed factions known in the Pakistani and Western media as the \\"Northern Alliance\\", was constituted in opposition to the Taliban under the leadership of Massoud.

Jeanette Winterson, photographed by Mariusz Kubik 17th century map of London (W.Hollar) Set in 17th century London, Sexing the Cherry is about the journeys of a mother, known as The Dog Woman, and her prot√©g√©, Jordan. They journey in a space-time flux: across the seas to find exotic fruits such as bananas and pineapples; and across time, with glimpses of \\"the present\\" and references to Charles I of England and Oliver Cromwell. The mother‚Äôs physical appearance is somewhat \\"grotesque\\". She is a giant, wrapped in a skirt big enough to serve as a ship‚Äôs sail and strong enough to fling an elephant. She is also hideous, with smallpox scars in which fleas live, a flat nose and foul teeth. Her son, however, is proud of her, as no other mother can hold a good dozen oranges in her mouth all at once. Ultimately, their journey is a journey in search of The Self. Sexing the Cherry is a postmodernist work and features many examples of intertextuality. It also incorporates the fairy tale of the Twelve Dancing Princesses. \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" Within the novel, Jeanette Winterson utilizes the individual stories of \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" in order to make a statement about the usual, subversive nature of femininity in a patriarchal society. In this reclaimed story, the author chooses to give the women princesses a voice of determination, one that undercuts the nature of the usual fairy tale story ending. In each of the stories that the princesses tell, the male figure is oppressive, dominating, foul, and overall a burden to the women. In turn, the women decide to run away with secret lovers, or to kill their respective husbands in order to live a better life. Through the use of this story, Winterson achieves further contrast to the main characters' story lines given that Jordan is in search of a meaningful link between himself and the gender roles offered in society while Dog Woman is consistently portrayed as a highly masculine character with larger than life qualities that set her apart from the standards of femininity according to societal norms. Historiography Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry has been argued to be an important historiographical novel for women; this novel considers women's role, prominence, or lack of prominence in society within historical fiction. Jeffrey Roessner argues: \\"The focus of feminist historiographers has steadily shifted from recovering the neglected past experience of women to historicizing the patriarchal values that helped produce such experience.\\" In addition to voicing her concern with the hierarchical structures in society, within her novel Winterson encourages readers to think about sex dichotomies as a thing of the past. With her main characters of Dog Woman and Jordan she achieves a contrasting of the sexes that has been taken into consideration multiple times by scholarly articles such as Roessner's. When considering these two main characters within the novel as a historiography and the context they are put into, what is important to remember is that: \\"Ultimately...Winterson rejects linear temporality and endorses an apocalyptic urge to escape history and the power structures of a male-dominated society.\\" References Category:Metafictional novels Category:1989 British novels Category:Novels by Jeanette Winterson Category:British magic realism novels Category:Novels set in London Category:Fiction set in the 17th century Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books ","title":"Sexing the Cherry"},{"id":"10798990","text":"Sir James Robert Gowan, (December 22, 1815 - March 18, 1909) was a Canadian lawyer, judge, and senator.

The song is sung again in the finale as the final song of the musical. This second version, which immediately follows a number by Jean Valjean and others, is sung by the entire cast with revised lyrics, and becomes progressively louder with each stanza. The song is a revolutionary call for people to overcome adversity. The \\"barricades\\" referred to in the song are erected by the rebel students in the streets of Paris in the musical's second act. They are to draw the National Guard into combat and ignite a civilian uprising to overthrow the government, but their rebellion eventually fails. =Use in various languages= *The original French version of the musical did not end with the full ensemble singing this song; It only later became the musical's finale song when it was revamped for the English-language version. *At the special Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert in 1995, Do You Hear the People Sing? was sung by 17 different actors who had played Jean Valjean around the world. Each actor sang a line of the song in his own language. The languages sung were English, French, German, Japanese, Hungarian, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, Norwegian, Czech, Danish, and Icelandic. *Another unofficial adaptation of Do You Hear the People Sing? is to Turkish, named Duyuyor Musun Bizi ƒ∞≈üte √áapulcu'nun Sesi sang during Gezi Park Protests.Gezi Park protests *In 2017 during the 45th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos, an unofficial Filipino adaptation of the song, entitled as Di Mo Ba Naririnig?, was used as a protest song. * In Chinese language speaking countries/regions, there are many versions of the song. A popular Mandarin Chinese (Standard Chinese/ÊôÆÈÄöËØù) version - Ê∞ë‰ºóÂëêÂñä is a singable translation authentic to the original English lyrics. *In Hong Kong/Taiwan, there are Cantonese ‚Äì ÂïèË™∞Êú™ÁôºËÅ≤ and Taiwanese ‚Äì ‰Ω†Êï¢ÊúâËÅΩÁùÄÂí±ÁöÑÊ≠å versions are mixtures of dialect translation from the English lyrics and specific references to corresponding political protests (see below). *In June 2013, in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the song was adapted in Arabic and performed by all 27 contestants from across the Arab world on the final episode of Arab Idol (season 2). The song is titled: Hear the Voice of the Oppressed (in Arabic: ÿ≥ÿßŸÖÿπ ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇŸáŸàÿ±ŸäŸÜ). Another adaptation was created by Fabrica, an Egyptian theatrical team, in Egyptian dialect (in Arabic: ÿ≥ÿßŸÖÿπ ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ±). The song, among few others from the musical, was performed on Albernameg (episode 27 ‚Äì season 3) and aired on 14 June 2013. =Use as a protest song= The song used as a slogan in the 2014 Hong Kong protests There are unofficial adaptations of Do You Hear the People Sing? in Cantonese and Taiwanese, intended as actual protest songs; better known versions include \\"Asking Who That Hasn't Spoken Out\\" (ÂïèË™∞Êú™ÁôºËÅ≤), written in Cantonese for Occupy Central with Love and Peace, and L√≠ K√°m ≈™ Thiann-tioÃçh L√°n √ä Kua (‰Ω†Êï¢ÊúâËÅΩÁùÄÂí±ÁöÑÊ≠å) in Taiwanese Hokkien. The song can be heard in protests in Hong Kong as recently as of September 2019, when students sang this song over the national anthem during a secondary school's opening assembly. The song was initially removed on music platforms including QQ Music in mainland China because of its widespread usage in anti-extradition bill protests, while its English version was later removed from those platforms. Aside from the aforementioned Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien adaptations, The Telegraph said that the song \\"has long chimed with people protesting around the world\\", adding that it was heard at the 2011 Wisconsin protests, the 2013 protests in Turkey, and a protest against the opening of a McDonald's restaurant in Australia in 2013. It has also been used by anti-TTIP protesters who have interrupted TTIP congresses as flashmobs singing the song. The song was also used in support of the Maidan protests in 2014 by the group Ukraine 2020, who released a music video for the song on YouTube. In 2016, the song was used as a protest song in South Korea's nationwide Park Geun-hye resignation movement. Iraqis involved in the protests in 2019 also released a video with the song used. More recently in July 2020, a Tagalog version of the song has also appeared in protests in the Philippines in light of the ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy where Filipinos protested in front of the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center to express their support with the media giant. In September 2020, a number of MSLU students in Minsk, Belarus, were detained after performing Do You Hear the People Sing? in the lobby of their educational institution. The students were protesting after president Lukashenko's disputed re-election.Masked Men Drag Protesting Belarusian Students Off the Streets =Use in politics= On 16 September 2016, during his presidential campaign, Donald Trump used the song in a rally in Miami under the parody title Les D√©plorables, a response to Hillary Clinton's controversial \\"basket of deplorables\\" label.

The primary purpose of a temper mill is to improve the surface finish on steel products. Components A typical type of temper mill installation includes entry into Ryan's face equipment for staging and accepting hot rolled coils of steel which have been hot wound at the end of a hot strip mill or hot rolled plate mill. Also included in a typical temper mill installation are pinch rolls, a leveler (sometimes two levelers), a shear for cutting the finished product to pre-determined lengths, a stacker for accumulating cut lengths of product Sometimes a temper mill installation includes a re-coil line where the finished product is a coil instead of bundles of cut lengths of product. Maximum product flexibility capability could be attained if the installation was arranged to produce both coils and bundles of cut to length product. The heart of the temper mill is the cold rolling mill stand which produces the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be work roll driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single rolling mill stand, but may have two. Pinch rolls provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass. Function The process goal is physical property enhancement through cold forming of the steel product in the bite of the work rolls. The physical properties that are enhanced by the temper pass due to elongation of the product include: * Dimensional trueness and repeatability * Suppression of yield point elongation * Improved product surface finish * Improve product shape and flatness * Decrease coil memory * Increase product yield strength * Develop proper stiffness or temper Typical elongation produced in the product is 0.5% to 2%. Product dimensions vary. Thicknesses include typical sheet metal gauges up to 1.00\\" thick plate. Widths vary from 36\\" to 125\\". The finish of the rolled product is controlled by using rolls having a variety of surface finishes designed to impart the desired finish to the product. Roll finishes range from ground and polished rolls to impart a bright finish, to shot-blasted or electric-discharged textured rolls that produce a dull, velvety finish on the steel surface. Typical auxiliary equipment includes PLC based controls, overhead traveling cranes, roll changing equipment, roll grinding equipment, hydraulic power unit(s), bundle lifting devices, Coil handling devices, etc. References Category:Steel Category:Metal forming ","title":"Temper mill"},{"id":"10799090","text":"The Bridge River is a major tributary of the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada Bridge River can also refer to a number of other topics related to the Bridge River including: *Bridge River Country, a historic geographic region and mining district in British Columbia, Canada *Bridge River, British Columbia, the name of three separate towns or localities connected with the Bridge River and its valley *Bridge River Indian Band, a First Nations government in British Columbia, Canada *Bridge River Canyon, a gorge on the river separating the Shulaps Range and Mission Ridge *Bridge River Power Project, a hydroelectric power development involving the river *Bridge River Cones, a volcanic field located in the uppermost basin of the river *Bridge River Ash, a large volcanic ash deposit that spans from southwestern British Columbia to central Alberta, Canada *Bridge River Ocean, an ancient ocean in the area of what is now the Interior of British Columbia *Bridge River Delta Provincial Park, a provincial park located on the river's upper reaches *Bridge River (Yukon) is a tributary of the Tatshenshini River See also *Bridge Creek (disambiguation) ","title":"Bridge River (disambiguation)"},{"id":"10799102","text":"Robop Limited's R:Falcon Bird Deterrent \\"Robop\\" is short for robotic bird of prey. The business, Robop Ltd. is the creator of the innovative R:Falcon mechanical bird control deterrent - based on the peregrine falcon. The falcon is the natural predator of most species of pest birds that predominantly cause bird problems. The R:Falcon could be considered both a sound and visual deterrent, the device flaps its wings, moves its head, and makes the call of a real live peregrine falcon. History Of Robop Ltd. Robop Ltd. Was founded in 2001 in response to rapidly increasing Gull populations in the urban environment. This was having a serious impact on the owners of large buildings where traditional approaches to bird control were not working. The initial concept was the brainchild of Bob McIntyre who possessed a lifetime of practical knowledge and experience in bird behaviour. He was joined by Alan Davie, Bob Samuel and John Donald, experts in building and financing technology companies. As of 2020 John Donald is the MD of the company which is currently headquartered in East Lothian, United Kingdom. The aim of Robop Ltd. was to bring a sophisticated, attractive and effective product to the market for businesses. Offering flexibility, a long-life span and the ability to cover extensive areas where bird netting and spikes ceased to be practical, aesthetic or cost-effective. R:Falcon Bird Control Installation at Cavendish School, UK. R:Falcon Bird Deterrent R:Falcons are built to order at Robop Ltd's engineering centre in Scotland. The head, main body and wings are moulded out of fibreglass and each deterrent contains over 100 parts and is designed to turn off at night to save energy. Each bird is also fitted with volume controls so that R:Falcon owners can change the sound at their leisure. The R:Falcon is available in 3 power types, battery, mains and solar power. All of Robop's solar panels have been tested at a latitude of 54th parallel North. A latitude which receives some of the lowest levels of sunlight. R:Falcon has been both purchased and rented by businesses from various industries around the world and has a good success rate. The system is adaptable to purchasers needs and has been used for both deterrent and environmental reasons. Robop Ltd. designed an alternative and adapted version of the system in 2012 named the Outlander System for sports pitches. This version is currently used by both sports centres and schools around the UK. Robop's R:Falcon Outlander System For Sports Pitches. In April 2007 the Liverpool city council purchased 10 Robops at a unit cost of ¬£3,000, in an attempt to rid the town center of pigeons. It is unclear whether this has had much success but a smaller scale effort at Swansea University was effective. The birds are also used at airports, hotels, solar panel arrays, retailers, manufacturing and construction sites, railway stations, shopping centres and office blocks across the UK, Europe and the USA. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in the UK have applauded the initiative as a means to get away from attempts to poison and starve pigeons, citing the eradication program in London under Mayor Ken Livingstone. In 2004 a documentary was aired on the Discovery Channel featuring Robop and the R:Falcon. A clip from the documentary showing the deterrent in action can still be found on YouTube.

Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place. About fashion designers Fashion designers work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market, designers must at times anticipate changes to consumer tastes. Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer's role; however, there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used. Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, and they work within a wide range of materials, colors, patterns and styles. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as evening wear or party dresses. Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and every-day wear is called ready to wear.  Structure  Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other high-end fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Justice, or Juicy Couture are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.  Designing a garment  Fashion designers work in different ways. Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form, another term for mannequine. When a designer is completely satisfied with the fit of the toile (or muslin), he or she will consult a professional pattern maker who then makes the finished, working version of the pattern out of card or via a computerized system. Finally, a sample garment is made up and tested on a model to make sure it is an operational outfit. History Ch√©ruit salon on Place Vend√¥me in Paris, 1910 Fashion design is generally considered to have started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments that he created. Before the former draper set up his maison couture (fashion house) in Paris, clothing design and creation was handled by largely anonymous seamstresses, and high fashion descended from that worn at royal courts. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term couturier was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered as fashion design. It was during this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs instead of presenting completed garments on models to customers began as an economy. Types of fashion Garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories =Haute couture= Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a made-to-measure or haute couture basis (French for high-sewing), with each garment being created for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make. Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity. =Ready-to-wear (pr√™t-√†-porter)= Ready-to-wear, or pr√™t-√†-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of Fashion Week include: spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal. Half-way garments are an alternative to ready-to-wear, \\"off-the-peg\\", or pr√™t-√†-porter fashion. Half-way garments are intentionally unfinished pieces of clothing that encourages co-design between the \\"primary designer\\" of the garment, and what would usually be considered, the passive \\"consumer\\".Hirscher and Niinimaki. Fashion Activism through Participatory Design. 10th European Academy of Design Conference, Crafting the Future, April 2013, Helinski, Finland. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304354045_Fashion_Activism_through_Participatory_Design This differs from ready-to-wear fashion, as the consumer is able to participate in the process of making and co-designing their clothing. During the Make{able} workshop, Hirscher and Niinimaki found that personal involvement in the garment-making process created a meaningful ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù for the user, which established a person-product attachment and increased the sentimental value of the final product. Otto von Busch also explores half-way garments and fashion co-design in his thesis, \\"Fashion-able, Hacktivism and engaged Fashion Design\\".von Busch, O. Fashion-able, Hacktivism and engaged Fashion Design, PhD Thesis, School of Design and Crafts (HDK), Gothenburg. 2008, https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/17941/3/gupea_2077_17941_3.pdf. =Mass market= Currently, the fashion industry relies more on mass-market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready- to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their versions of the original look. To save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machines. The end product can, therefore, be sold much more cheaply. There is a type of design called \\"kutch\\" originated from the German word kitschig, meaning \\"trashy\\" or \\"not aesthetically pleasing\\". Kitsch can also refer to \\"wearing or displaying something that is therefore no longer in fashion\\".  Income  Median annual wages for salaried fashion designers were $61,160 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $42,150 and $87,120. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,150, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $124,780. Median annual earnings were $52,860 (¬£40,730.47) in apparel, piece goods, and notions - the industry employing the largest numbers of fashion designers. ,a fashion designer's median annual salary was $65,170. High end designers can earn around $92,550. In 2016, 23,800 people were counted as fashion designers in the United States.

On the US west coast, there is also a significant number of fashion houses in Los Angeles, where a substantial percentage of high fashion clothing manufactured in the United States is actually made. Beverly Hills, particularly on Rodeo Drive, is globally renowned for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in Miami, Chicago, Dallas, and especially San Francisco have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, New York Fashion Week, is the oldest of the four major fashion weeks held throughout the world. Parsons The New School for Design, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City, is considered one of the top fashion schools in the world. There are numerous fashion magazines published in the United States and distributed to a global readership. Examples include Vogue, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan. American fashion design is highly diverse, reflecting the enormous ethnic diversity of the population, but is largely dominated by a clean-cut, urban, hip aesthetic, and often favors a more casual style, reflecting the athletic, health-conscious lifestyles of the suburban and urban middle classes. Famous American brands and designers include Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Coach, Nike, Vans, Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY, Tom Ford, Caswell-Massey, Michael Kors, Levi Strauss and Co., Est√©e Lauder, Revlon, Kate Spade, Alexander Wang, Vera Wang, Victoria‚Äôs Secret, Tiffany and Co., Converse, Oscar de la Renta, John Varvatos, Anna Sui, Prabal Gurung, Bill Blass, Halston, Carhartt, Brooks Brothers, Stuart Weitzman, Diane von Furstenberg, J.

Well known Belgian designers are the Antwerp Six: Ann Demeulemeester, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Bikkembergs, Dirk Van Saene, Walter Van Beirendonck and Marina Yee, as well as Maison Martin Margiela, Raf Simons, Kris Van Assche, Bruno Pieters, Anthony Vaccarello.Holgate, Mark, ‚Ä≤How Anthony Vaccarello Is Making Saint Laurent His Own‚Ä≤, (Feb. 13, 2018), Vogue March 2018, https://www.vogue.com/article/anthony-vaccarello-interview-vogue- march-2018-issue, Retrieved 3 March 2018. =British fashion design= Models at an event in UK, wearing (from left to right)- shorts, trousers, mini skirt. London has long been the capital of the United Kingdom fashion industry and has a wide range of foreign designs which have integrated with modern British styles. Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain. =French fashion design= Most French fashion houses are in Paris, which is the capital of French fashion. Traditionally, French fashion is chic and stylish, defined by its sophistication, cut, and smart accessories. French fashion is internationally acclaimed. =Spanish fashion design= Alpargatas\\" or espadrilles are a symbol of Spanish summer fashion Madrid and Barcelona are the main fashion cities of Spain. Spanish fashion is often more conservative and traditional but also more 'timeless' than other fashion cultures. Spaniards are know not to take great risks when dressing. Nonetheless, many are the fashion brands and designers coming from Spain. =German fashion design= Berlin is the centre of fashion in Germany (prominently displayed at Berlin Fashion Week), while D√ºsseldorf holds Europe's largest fashion trade fairs with Igedo. Other important centres of the scene are Munich, Hamburg, and Cologne. German fashion is famed for its elegant lines as well as unconventional young designs and the great variety of styles. =Italian fashion design= Red carpet fashion: Italian actors Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi wearing designer formal wear at Venice Film Festival, 2009 Milan is Italy's fashion capital. Most of the older Italian couturiers are in Rome. However, Milan and Florence are the Italian fashion capitals, and it is the exhibition venue for their collections. Italian fashion features casual and glamorous elegance. =Japanese fashion design= Most Japanese fashion houses are in Tokyo.

However, the state's socialist ideology consistently moderated and influenced these trends. In addition, shortages of consumer goods meant that the general public did not have ready access to pre-made fashion. =Swiss fashion design= Most of the Swiss fashion houses are in Z√ºrich. The Swiss look is casual elegant and luxurious with a slight touch of quirkiness. Additionally, it has been greatly influenced by the dance club scene. = Mexican fashion design = In the development of Mexican indigenous dress, the fabrication was determined by the materials and resources that are available in specific regions, impacting the ‚Äúfabric, shape and construction of a people‚Äôs clothing‚Äù. Textiles were created from plant fibers including cotton and agave. Class status differentiated what fabric was worn. Mexican dress was influenced by geometric shapes to create the silhouettes. Huipil a blouse characterized by a ‚Äúloose, sleeveless tunic made of two or three joined webs of cloth sewn lengthwise‚Äù is an important historical garment, often seen today. After the Spanish Conquest, traditional Mexican clothing shifted to take a Spanish resemblance. Mexican indigenous groups rely on specific embroidery and colors to differentiate themselves from each other.Valdiosera, Ram√≥n. ‚ÄúRosa Mexicano: Moda y Marca.‚Äù Artes De M√©xico, no. 111, 2013, pp. 60‚Äì65. Mexican Pink is a significant color to the identity of Mexican art and design and general spirit. The term \\"Rosa Mexicano\\" as described by Ram√≥n Valdiosera was established by prominent figures such as Dolores del R√≠o and designer Ram√≥n Val in New York.Valdiosera, Ram√≥n. ‚ÄúRosa Mexicano: Moda y Marca.‚Äù Artes De M√©xico, no. 111, 2013, pp. 60‚Äì65. When newspapers and magazines such as El Imparcial and El Mundo Ilustrado circulated in Mexico, became a significant movement, as it informed the large cities, such as Mexico City, of European fashions. This encouraged the founding of department stores, changing the existent pace of fashion.Chassen-L√≥pez, Francie. \\"The Traje de Tehuana as National Icon: Gender, Ethnicity, and Fashion in Mexico.\\" The Americas, vol. 71 no. 2, 2014, p. 281-314. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/tam.2014.0134. With access to European fashion and dress, those with high social status relied on adopting those elements to distinguish themselves from the rest. Juana Catarina Romero was a successful entrepreneur and pioneer in this movement. = Malaysia fashion design = Malaysian Designer CSHEON Bags Display in Robinsons Departmental Store Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia In Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur is the major fashion and production city.Kuala Lumpur FASHION WEEK and Malaysia Fashion Week / Malaysia Fashion Week Fashion design terms * A fashion designer conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed. * A technical designer works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass- producing the garment. * A pattern maker (also referred as pattern master or pattern cutter) drafts the shapes and sizes of a garment's pieces. This may be done manually with paper and measuring tools or by using a CAD computer software program. Another method is to drape fabric directly onto a dress form. The resulting pattern pieces can be constructed to produce the intended design of the garment and required size. Formal training is usually required for working as a pattern marker. * A tailor makes custom designed garments made to the client's measure; especially suits (coat and trousers, jacket and skirt, et cetera). Tailors usually undergo an apprenticeship or other formal training. * A textile designer designs fabric weaves and prints for clothes and furnishings. Most textile designers are formally trained as apprentices and in school. * A stylist co-ordinates the clothes, jewelry, and accessories used in fashion photography and catwalk presentations. A stylist may also work with an individual client to design a coordinated wardrobe of garments. Many stylists are trained in fashion design, the history of fashion, and historical costume, and have a high level of expertise in the current fashion market and future market trends. However, some simply have a strong aesthetic sense for pulling great looks together. * A fashion buyer selects and buys the mix of clothing available in retail shops, department stores, and chain stores. Most fashion buyers are trained in business and/or fashion studies. * A seamstress sews ready-to-wear or mass-produced clothing by hand or with a sewing machine, either in a garment shop or as a sewing machine operator in a factory. She (or he) may not have the skills to make (design and cut) the garments, or to fit them on a model. * A dressmaker specializes in custom-made women's clothes: day, cocktail, and evening dresses, business clothes and suits, trousseaus, sports clothes, and lingerie. * A fashion forecaster predicts what colours, styles and shapes will be popular (\\"on-trend\\") before the garments are on sale in stores. * A model wears and displays clothes at fashion shows and in photographs. * A fit model aids the fashion designer by wearing and commenting on the fit of clothes during their design and pre-manufacture. Fit models need to be a particular size for this purpose. * A fashion journalist writes fashion articles describing the garments presented or fashion trends, for magazines or newspapers.

Arguably the most important progressive rock band in Russia.  Style  The band described its style as \\"a battery of keyboards - drums - bass; hard rhythm section support and soloing keyboards\\". Little Tragedies has their very own style, influenced by classical music and heavy art rock. The music of Little Tragedies is very melodic and always features a keyboard solo with an improvisation accent. The band are one of the only progressive rock bands in Russia using Moog and Hammond keyboards. Most of the songs of the band are based on known Russian poets, especially Nikolai Gumilev. The name of the group itself is taken from a piece by Alexander Pushkin. Due to the fact Ilyin moved to live in Germany, he sends the music scores to the band members via email, and after they learn it he arrives to Kursk for the rehearsals and recordings.  History  Little Tragedies were founded in 1994 by the graduate of St. Petersburg Conservatory, composer Gennady Ilyin, in the city of Kursk, after previously performing with a band called Paradox. The name was taken from a play by Alexander Pushkin. The group's first recording, 1, was never recorded as an album. It exists only on an amateur videotape made from the group's only concert at that moment. Since 1995 the band was a trio: Gennady Ilyin - keyboards; Yuri Skripkin - drums; Oleg Babynin - bass. With such a line-up the group played till 2000. After visiting Paris, Gennady Ilyin started working on the Paris Symphony. Although this album was recorded in a professional studio in Moscow and was more than once performed by the group in music schools and concert halls, it remained unrecognized until 2008 when the French label Musea Records surprisingly released it. 1997 - the beginning of 1998. It took G. Ilyin a month to compose a fairytale ballet \\"Magic Shop\\" about a little girl's Christmas adventures. He practiced it with the band and it was performed on the stage only two and a half years later. In the year 2000, Little Tragedies released their first two albums, The Sun of Spirit and Porcelain Pavilion, on the record label Boheme Music. The albums were recorded by Ilyin in 1998‚Äì1999, with the help of musicians Igor Mihel (guitar) and Yevgeniy Shukin (audio engineering). Though originally recorded as Gennady Ilyin's solo albums, Ilyin decided to release the albums under the Little Tragedies name. In summer 2000, Alexander Malakhovsky (guitar) and Aleksey Bildin (saxophone) joined the original trio (Ilyin, Skripkin and Babynin). With the new line-up, in 2001 the group created the last album of the trilogy to the poems of N. Gumilev, Return (the first were The Sun of Spirit and Porcelain Pavilion). The album was first released by the French label Musea Records. At the same time the band signed with the record label MALS, the biggest progressive music label in Russia, and the album also became available for the Russian public. In 2003 the band released their fourth album, New Faust, a double concept album which was written back in 1997‚Äì98. In this album Faust is not only the character of a national drama who is conflicting with the society, but he is also a man of the universe seeking ways to clean his soul and acquire a spirit. In 2006 the band released a fifth album, The Sixth Sense. In the same year the band opened the second day of the InProg 2006 festival. In 2007 the band released the first and later the second part of their sixth album based on Russian translations to Chinese poetry, Chinese Songs, with the main theme of the album being the relationship between man and nature. In 2008 the band released Cross, which was recorded in August 2007. The entire album was based on poetry by Nikolai Gumilev, In 2009 the French label Musea Records will release the Paris Symphony, an unreleased album recorded by the band in 1997 when it featured only three members. In 2006 an event happened which attracted the media attention when the instruments of the band were stolen from their rehearsal studio. The thief was caught and the instruments were returned to the band. In August 2008 the band recorded an instrumental Christmas album called The Magic Shop, which was written ten years before. It was released on November 2009 as a free download on the band's web-site as a Christmas gift for the fans. At the same year the band's record-label MALS re-released The Sun of Spirit and Porcelain Pavilion, with bonus-tracks, though they were re- released as Gennady Ilyin's solo albums. In 2009 the band finished recording a new album called Obsessed. The album was released in 2011. Between 2011-2012 the band recorded an album called At Nights, and the mixing process went through 2013. The release date was set for January 2014. The Magic Shop, which was released as a free download few years earlier, was released on a CD by Musea Records in 2014. In 2014 Little Tragedies held a special performance in the Kursk Philharmonic Hall to celebrate twenty years since the founding of the band. It was planned show would be later released on a double DVD. It was the first live concert held by the band since 2006. The concert was the band's first live performance in seven years, mostly due to the fact the lead singer had moved to Germany, whilst the rest remained in Kursk In 2019, the band released Paradise behind the Stove with a different record label, Macalla records.

Located beside the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba in Letterkenny, it is one of eighteen Loreto secondary schools in Ireland and is the one of the very few schools in Ireland that still have nuns employed in the school and the only Loreto school that has a direct link with the Sisters of Loreto. The Convent secondary school is linked with the primary school for girls, Scoil Mhuire Gan Smal, as they are both part of the greater Loreto College Network. Many of the girls' brothers attend or will have attended St Eunan's College, which is a short distance up the road. In addition, the primary school for boys, Scoil Colmcille, is located across the road. History Mary Ward founded The Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (better known in Ireland as the \\"Loreto Order\\") in England in the 17th century. Mother Frances Teresa Ball brought the Order to Ireland in 1821. In 1854, the then Bishop of Raphoe, Dr McGettigan, invited the religious sisters to set up a secondary school for girls in Letterkenny. The day-school opened with 5 pupils on 4 September 1854. From the 1920s until 1976 it was an all- Irish school. A new wing with a concert hall opened in 1939. Boarding ceased in 1978. Extensions were added in 1972, 1978 and 1986, while an extension (sanctioned by the Department of Education) opened to coincide with the school's 150th anniversary in mid-2004. The first classes began here in September 2005. Noel Ferry became the school's first lay and male headmaster since its opening.

It concerns George (Adebimpe), a shy, bespectacled man who is about to marry a fellow Nigerian American woman named Sophie Ochenado, played by Abiola Abrams, when he falls for a Spanish woman. It is based on a short film called Jorge.  Plot  Three days before his wedding, George meets two intriguing people: Alicia (Verbeke), a Spanish woman who invites him to a party that night, and Gerard (Girardot), an unlucky-in-love Frenchman who has just been turned down for a marriage proposal. To cheer him up, George takes him to Alicia's party. There, George finds himself attracted to Alicia, but she is already dating a British professor, Nathan. A drunk Gerard goes to the roof and attempts suicide, but George talks him out of it by telling him to \\"jump tomorrow.\\" Out of gratitude, Gerard offers to drive George to his wedding. On the road, George buys an audiocassette to learn Spanish and secretly fantasizes about Alicia. The movie spoofs Spanish soap operas in fantasy sequences where George imagines himself and Alicia as characters on the show. The compassionate Gerard figures out that George is not in love with his fianc√©e, a childhood friend whom his family has always expected him to marry. George is a passive individual who does not seem troubled by the idea of marrying someone he does not love. George spots Alicia and her boyfriend at a gas station, and Gerard talks George into following them. They all end up at a hotel with a love motif and a variety of strange furniture, including a bathtub in the form of a giant champagne glass. Gerard advises George to gain Alicia's attention by making her jealous. A reluctant George ends up inviting to his room a saleswoman who calls herself \\"Heather Leather.\\" But he doesn't know that she's allergic to cologne, and disaster ensues. He never crosses paths with Alicia, whose boyfriend gives her an engagement ring made of bone. The next day, George wants to resume his journey alone. But Gerard gives a heartfelt speech about love, and he convinces George to stick with him. Alicia and her fianc√© hitch a ride with George and Gerard, thinking their sudden appearance a coincidence. Alicia's fianc√© Nathan practices t'ai chi in the rain and argues with Gerard about whether the French language is obsolete. Meanwhile, Alicia and George find themselves falling for each other. When they arrive at the home of Alicia's family, who are meeting Alicia's fianc√© for the first time, George wants to leave. But Gerard convinces him to stick around for the night, telling him to \\"jump tomorrow.\\" Alicia's fianc√© ends up in bed the whole time after Alicia's uncle, a deaf-mute, offers him a spicy dish his stomach can't handle. The uncle takes a liking to George and teaches him a Spanish dance. Gerard finds himself attracted to Alicia's mother, a widow. They all enjoy the party that night, and George gets a chance to make his move, but he is too shy to proceed. Gerard spends the night with Alicia's mother, but in the morning she rebuffs him for moving too fast with their relationship. Gerard and George leave for the wedding. After dropping off George, Gerard heads towards Niagara Falls, where he again considers suicide until a boy standing there tells him that he gets his best ideas when he is by himself. At the ceremony, George declares \\"I am Jorge\\" (the Spanish form of George) and calls the wedding off. He and his fianc√©e Sophie agree that their intended marriage was for convenience and not an ideal match. Gerard and George catch up to Alicia and her fianc√© at the border of Canada, and George finally expresses his love for her.

One breast can have one or more breast cysts. They are often described as round or oval lumps with distinct edges. In texture, a breast cyst usually feels like a soft grape or a water-filled balloon, but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm. Breast cysts can be painful and may be worrisome but are generally benign. They are most common in pre-menopausal women in their 30s or 40s. They usually disappear after menopause, but may persist or reappear when using hormone therapy. They are also common in adolescents. Breast cysts can be part of fibrocystic disease. The pain and swelling is usually worse in the second half of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Treating breast cysts is usually not necessary unless they are painful or cause discomfort. In most cases, the discomfort they cause may be alleviated by draining the fluid from the cyst. The cysts form as a result of the growth of the milk glands and their size may range from smaller than a pea to larger than a ping pong ball. Small cysts cannot be felt during a physical examination, and some large cysts feel like lumps. However, most cysts, regardless of their size cannot be identified during physical exams. Breast cysts are not to be confused with \\"milk cysts\\" (galactoceles), which usually appear during weaning.  Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of breast cysts include: * A smooth, easily movable round or oval breast lump with distinct edges * Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the lump * Increased lump size and tenderness just before menstruation * Decreased lump size and resolution of other signs and symptoms after menstruation * Having one or many simple breast cysts does not increase a person's risk of breast cancer. Lumps in the breast are often not found during self-examinations or physical exams. However, in some cases they can be felt at touch, especially if they are larger. Breasts are usually lumpy or nodular as a result of the hormonal changes that women go through during their menstrual cycle. However, new breast lumps should always be referred to a specialist. Cysts can also be confused with infections that form on the nipple or the areola. A common cyst look-alike is a localised infection of a duct in the nipple. These can happen whether you're breast feeding or not, (if you are breast feeding it could also be a bleb) this becomes a bump that may then start to look yellow and white (pus filled). Check with your doctor if you are unsure or have other symptoms that are worrying you. Fluid leaking from a cyst, as may happen due to puncture or vigorous compression during mammography, or due to seat belt injury in the course of an automobile accident, may trigger an aseptic inflammation in the surrounding breast tissue.  Diagnosis Needle biopsy being performed to determine nature of lump either fluid-filled cyst or solid tumor The cystic nature of a breast lump can be confirmed by ultrasound examination, aspiration (removal of contents with needle), or mammogram. Ultrasound can also show if the cyst contains solid nodules, a sign that the lesion may be pre-cancerous or cancerous. Examination by a cytopathologist of the fluid aspirated from the cyst may also help with this diagnosis. In particular, it should be sent to a laboratory for testing if it is blood-stained. Commonly, cysts are detected with the help of mammograms. However, the medical history and physical examination also play an important role in establishing an accurate diagnosis. During these tests, the doctor will try to find out as much information as possible regarding the symptoms the patient has experienced, their intensity and duration and the physical examination is performed regularly to check for other abnormalities that may exist within the breast. As mentioned above, cysts are often undetectable at touch. Therefore, a mammogram can provide valuable and clear images of the breast tissue. Generally, if there is any abnormality within the breast tissue, it will be shown on the mammogram. There are two types of mammograms available. One of them is primarily used in screening, and are ordered for patients who do not show any symptoms and these are called screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms are used on patients who developed certain symptoms of a breast condition or in patients whose screening mammograms showed abnormalities. Patients suspected of breast cysts will normally be given a diagnosing mammogram, although they are not suspected of cancer. This type of mammogram provides the doctor with the possibility of performing a breast ultrasound at the same time and this is the reason why they are often preferred over the screening mammograms. Breast ultrasound is considered the best option when diagnosing breast cysts because it is 95 to 100% accurate, it provides a clear image on the cyst's appearance (simple or complex) and it may also distinguish between solid lumps and fluid-filled cysts, which a mammogram cannot do. Breast ultrasounds are performed with the help of a handheld medical instrument which is placed on the skin, after a special type of fluid has been applied on it. The instruments picks up the echo resulted from the sound waves it sends to the breast. These echoes are transmitted to a computer which translates it into a picture. Breast cysts may remain stable for many years or may resolve spontaneously. Most simple cysts are benign and do not require any treatment or further diagnostic workup. Some complex cysts may require further diagnostic measures such as fine needle aspiration or biopsy to exclude breast cancer however the overwhelming majority is of benign nature. Aspiration both diagnoses and removes cysts at the same time. That is, cysts will usually resolve on their own after the fluid is drained. Otherwise, if the lump is not a cyst, the fluid aspirated may contain blood or there may not be fluid at all. Whereas in the first case, the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further examination, the latter circumstance is a sign that the breast lump is solid. This type of tumor needs to be biopsied in order to determine whether it is malignant or benign.  Prevention  The development of breast cysts may be prevented to some degree, according to the majority of the specialists. The recommended measures one is able to take in order to avoid the formation of the cysts include practicing good health and avoiding certain medications, eating a balanced diet, taking necessary vitamins and supplements, getting exercise, and avoiding stress. Although caffeine consumption does not have a scientifically proved connection with the process of cyst development, many women claim that their symptoms are relieved if avoiding it. Some doctors recommend reducing the amount of caffeine in one's diet in terms of both beverages and foods (such as chocolate). Also reducing salt intake may help in alleviating the symptoms of breast cysts, although, again, there is no scientific linkage between these two. Excessive sugar consumption as well as undetected food allergies, such as to gluten or lactose, may also contribute to cyst development.  Treatment  Breast cysts do not require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or otherwise uncomfortable. In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms. Nipple cysts (commonly duct infections) would benefit from a hot compress to draw out the pus, antibacterial cream, and keeping it clean. Doctors have suggested these infected ducts will clear up within a few days. If there are other symptoms that are worrying you please see your Doctor. Typical treatment involves a Needle aspiration biopsy. Aspirated cysts often recur (come back); definitive treatment may require surgery. Draining the fluid and then waiting for the cyst to resolve is the main treatment applied in these cases. Moreover, if cysts are aspirated and the fluid looks normal, they do not require any other medical attention apart from following-up to make sure they have completely disappeared. Hormone therapy, by the means of oral contraceptives, is sometimes prescribed to reduce their recurrence and to regulate the menstrual cycle of the patient (which is likely to cause them in the first place). Danazol may also be prescribed to treat this condition and it is usually considered in patients on whom the non-medical treatment fails and the symptoms are intense. Surgical removal of a breast cyst is necessary only in a few unusual circumstances. If an uncomfortable breast cyst recurs month after month, or if a breast cyst contains blood-tinged fluid and displays other worrisome signs, surgery may be considered.  Epidemiology  It is estimated that 7% of women in the western world develop palpable breast cysts. In males, the occurrence of breast cysts is rare and may (but need not) be an indication of malignancy.  Cysts and bra support  Some women experience breast pain, especially when engaging in vigorous physical activity. A properly fitted sports bra, which compresses or encapsulates breast tissue, is designed to reduce pain caused by exercise.

History Bougainvillea in Mishkenot Sha'ananim Yemin Moshe was established in 1892‚Äì1894 by the Montefiore Welfare Fund. Located outside Jerusalem's Old City, it was conceived as a solution to the overcrowding and unsanitary conditions inside the walls. The Fund was continuing the work done by British Jewish banker Moses Montefiore and the new project was meant to mark the seventh year after the philanthropist's death. The name commemorates Montefiore's first name and a verse from the Book of Isaiah (). The land was bought in 1855 by Montefiore with money from the estate of Judah Touro and came to be known as Kerem Moshe VeYehudit, Moses and Judith Vineyard, after Montefiore and his wife. Yemin Moshe in snow. 1920s. The first housing project, Mishkenot Sha'ananim, consisted of two rows of buildings. Its first houses were completed by 1860 and contained 28 apartments of one-and-a-half rooms. The compound also had a water cistern with an iron pump imported from England, a mikveh and a communal oven. Few people were prepared to live there at the time due to its location outside the city walls, in an area open to Arab marauders. The original houses were built with a wall around them and a gate that was locked at night. The second row of houses of Mishkenot Sha'ananim was built in 1866 when a cholera epidemic was at its height in the Old City. Some of the people who took up residence in the new neighborhood refused to stay there at night, but that year, the demand for apartments rose as illness spread. The Yemin Moshe neighbourhood was built in 1892‚Äì1894 on the remaining lands around Mishkenot Sha'ananim. Joseph Sebag Montefiore, Moses Montefiore's nephew, signed the agreements which allowed for the construction project on the Kerem Moshe VeYehudit land.https://www.montefiorewines.net/timeline/ In addition to the windmill, which was built to allow poor Jews to grind their own flour, Montefiore built a printing press and textile factory, and helped to finance several agricultural colonies. He also attempted to acquire arable land for Jewish cultivation, but was hampered by Ottoman restrictions on land sale to non-Muslims. =Windmill= Montefiore left an indelible mark on the Jerusalem landscape by building in 1857 the windmill in what later became the Yemin Moshe neighbourhood. The windmill became operational in 1860. The idea behind it was weaning the residents from their reliance on the halukka, or charity. Montefiore believed that a mill could provide them with a source of livelihood, but it was only operative for approximately 19 years.

It was published in July 1550, and was Cranmer's first full-length book, but at his trial in September 1555, he said that it had been written seven years earlier, in 1548. Purpose Although Cranmer is concerned that \\"very simple and unlearned people\\" would understand and be edified by his book, the Defence is largely a polemic work, in which Cranmer attacked the Roman Catholic doctrine of his opponents, particularly Bishop Stephen Gardiner. In the preface he compares \\"beads, pardons, pilgrimages, and such other like popery\\" with weeds, but says the roots of the weeds are transubstantiation, the doctrine of the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and the sacrificial nature of the Roman Catholic mass. Contents The book itself is divided into five parts. Focusing mainly on using arguments based on reason, Cranmer quotes frequently from Scripture and patristic texts, structuring his argument in a lucid manner. Cranmer deals with the following topics: *The true use of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist) *The error of transubstantiation *The nature of Christ's presence in the bread and wine *The reception of the body and blood of Christ *The nature of the sacrifice Cranmer argues that for someone to eat the body and drink the blood of Jesus Christ means for that person to \\"dwell in Christ and to have Christ dwelling in him.\\" To truly partake in the sacrament requires faith.Cyril C. Richardson, \\"Cranmer and the Analysis of Eucharistic Doctrine,\\" JTS 16 [1965], 428. Cranmer distinguishes Christ's spiritual presence from his sacramental presence. Avoiding the Lutheran doctrine of Sacramental union, he argues that the spiritual presence occurs only through Christ's divine nature, he being in heaven in regards to his human nature. Cranmer follows a symbolic reading of the phrase \\"This is my body\\", and develops a view \\"remarkably close to that developed by Zwingli and Oecolampadius.\\"Alister E. McGrath, Reformation Thought: An Introduction (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999), 257. Reception During the summer and autumn of 1550, during which Gardiner was in the Tower of London, he wrote a retort which was presented to Cranmer at the conclusion of his trial in 1551. Gardiner was severely critical of Cranmer's arguments and cited a range of sources that he believed supported the doctrine of the corporeal presence of Christ in the elements of the Eucharist. Among these sources, were the Book of Common Prayer, Martin Luther, Cranmer's own catechism, and other Lutheran writers. Cranmer's use of the Church Fathers has drawn criticism. At his trial, he was charged with corrupting patristic texts and falsifying their meaning by \\"evil translating.\\"Cited in K. J. Walsh, \\"Cranmer and the Fathers, especially in the Defence,\\" JRH 11 [1981], 227. Cyril Richardson argues that \\"as a keen controversialist who wants the Fathers on his side,\\" Cranmer \\"is not above purposely leaving them unclear in order to win a point in a debate.\\"Richardson, \\"Cranmer and the Analysis of Eucharistic Doctrine,\\" 424. Geoffrey Bromiley has suggested that in the Defence, Cranmer becomes \\"so enmeshed in the detailed refutation of a false teaching that he cannot work out the implications of his positive statements.\\"G.

It drew a crowd of over 74,000 fans, which was an outdoor attendance record at the time. A VHS tape of the event was released later by Coliseum Home Video, with commentary by Gorilla Monsoon, Johnny Valiant, and Ernie Ladd. This 115 Minute tape featured edits to a number of the matches. In 2014, WWE Network made the same version of the event available on demand in the pay-per-view section (although the event was not originally broadcast via pay-per-view). Background The main event heading into the event was between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Paul Orndorff for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan and Orndorff's friendship became emphasized on the WWF's syndicated television programs throughout the summer, and eventually Adrian Adonis ‚Äì host of the talk show segment The Flower Shop ‚Äì began stirring up trouble between the two when he planted a suggestion that Orndorff was living in Hogan's shadow, calling him \\"Hulk Jr.\\" and that he had gone soft by teaming with Hogan. With a series of seemingly minor incidents involving Hogan irritating Orndorff, the two eventually accepted a challenge match with Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy (who were managed by Orndorff's former manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan), where Orndorff allowed Studd and Bundy to illegally double-team Hogan for an extended period of time before finally clearing them from the ring; Orndorff then helped Hogan to his feet, only to finish off Hogan with a clothesline and his finishing move, a piledriver. Shortly afterward, Orndorff announced he had re-hired former manager Bobby Heenan and demanded a title shot against Hogan. In the weeks leading up to the event, to help sell Orndorff's new heel character, he began using Hogan's entrance theme \\"Real American\\" and mocking him by mimicking several of Hogan's in-ring routines, such as cupping his ear to get fan reaction and flexing his muscles. Among the other top feuds going at the time was Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts. Roberts' first high-profile feud since entering the WWF earlier that year, the feud began when he attacked Steamboat before their match on Saturday Night's Main Event VI, finishing him off by hitting his finishing move, the DDT, onto the concrete floor, before resting his snake, Damien, on top of an unconscious Steamboat, all as Steamboat's wife, Bonnie, watched in horror. Steamboat later began bringing a \\"Komodo dragon\\" as his \\"pet\\" to combat the psychological effects of Roberts' snake. While Steamboat won most of their matches, the feud ratched to a point where a \\"Snake Pit\\" match (a no-disqualification match) was commissioned. Another top feud ongoing was The Machines vs. the Bobby Heenan- led team of Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. The feud's main fuel was Heenan's repeated claim that one of the Machines, the Giant Machine, was Andr√© the Giant attempting to circumvent a suspension for earlier no-showing for a tag-team match against Bundy and Studd, both of whom Andr√© had been embroiled in a bitter feud. At the time, Andr√© had been suffering from the effects of a legitimate back injury and was beginning to suffer the effects of acromegaly, a health condition that resulted in his gigantism and eventually led to his death in 1993; his \\"suspension\\" also allowed him to take time off to film The Princess Bride, which would be released a year later. Results Aftermath The following night World Wrestling Federation hosted Sam Muchnick Memorial Tournament in which Harley Race won by last defeating Ricky Steamboat The Hogan-Orndorff feud continued to rage into the fall of 1986, with Orndorff ‚Äì as he did at The Big Event ‚Äì using Hogan's entrance theme \\"Real American\\" as his own theme. Eventually, the two settled their differences in a series of steel cage matches. The most highly publicized cage match took place in December 1986, and aired on Saturday Night's Main Event IX, where at one point Hogan and Orndorff both simultaneously exited the cage and their feet hit the floor (a condition of winning the match); when video replays proved inconclusive, the match was restarted, with Hogan eventually getting a decisive victory. The Hogan-Orndorff feud would be named Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine's Feud of the Year for 1986, by a vote of the magazine's readers. The Machines continued to feud with the Studd-Bundy tag team, with Heenan's wrestlers never able to unmask the Giant Machine and prove that he was really Andr√© the Giant who was supposed to be under suspension. Eventually, the Machines disappeared and Andr√©'s suspension was lifted, to the unexplained approval of Heenan. In real life behind the scenes, the storyline for Andr√©'s eventual heel turn and demand to face Hogan at WrestleMania III for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was being planned, and Andr√©'s health was steadily continuing to worsen. The Hogan-Andr√© storyline would begin playing out in January 1987, while the other two members of the Machines team ‚Äì Blackjack Mulligan and Bill Eadie ‚Äì would adopt new gimmicks. Mulligan reverted to his normal Blackjack gimmick as a face, while Eadie would begin competing successfully as \\"Ax\\", one half of a new tag team known as Demolition with \\"Smash\\", a Road Warriors-inspired team of power brawlers with Kiss-type face paint. While Mulligan would fade from the WWF in early 1987, as Ax of Demolition Eadie would go on to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1988 and 1990. Downplayed at this supercard, but soon getting more and more hyped, was the feud between Hercules Hernandez and Billy Jack Haynes, two wrestlers who had feuded in several other organizations they had competed in at the same time. The feud began heating up in earnest in the late fall of 1986, culminating in a \\"Full Nelson Challenge\\" at WrestleMania III.

This part of the history seems to be well documented, but when the Berber dynasty of Almoravids started ruling, the history of the Rif was almost total blank. The usual tradition is that almost every existing social group in the Rif mountains, whether Arabian or Berberian in origin, originated from somewhere else, not too far away from the country.Tribe and Society in Rural Morocco Door David M. Hart Culture =Language= A Jebala woman at a marketplace The variety of Arabic spoken by the Jbala falls under the sub-dialect grouping of shamali Arabic. Together with shamali, the jebli dialect belongs to the so-called Pre- Hilali or Non-Hilali group of Maghrebi Arabic, sometimes also referred to as ‚Äòmountaineer Arabic‚Äô. This term was introduced by Mar√ßais Mar√ßais, W. (1956). Comment l‚ÄôAfrique du Nord a √©t√© arabis√©e. Annales de l'Institut d'Etudes Orientales XIV, 6-17. and ColinColin, G. (1945).

Rabat: Ecole de livre., who argued that the first arabicization of Northern Africa took place long before the migration of the famous Yemeni Bani Hilal tribe in 12th-13th centuries. The pre-Hilali group consists of the Jebli dialect together with the dialects spoken in other North African cities. The Jbala, together with several groups of population, inhabiting the Algerian and Tunisian part of the Tell Atlas, were the first Imazighen (Berbers) who arabicised their languageBrigui F., 2019. ¬´ De la continuit√© linguistique du pr√©hilalien de type jebli au-del√† du territoire des Jbala ¬ª, VII Congreso Internacional de √Årabe Marroqu√≠: din√°micas de cambios y nuevos horizontes, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, 25-26.04.2019 ; Al- Andalus-Magreb, Vol. 26, Num. 1, Universidad de C√°diz., probably due to their proximity to the old route that once connected Fes (as well as Tlemcen and Constantine) with Mediterranean ports, especially with those located in al- AndalusVignet-Zunz, J.

As the most archaic group of Arabic dialects in the region, the Pre- Hilali dialects are characterised by a strong influence from Berber on all levels ‚Äì phonetic, morphological, and lexical.Gintsburg, S. (2014). Formulaicity in Jbala poetry. Tilburg: Tilburg University Press. \\\\---- =Clothing= The traditional clothing for women includes shawls called \\"mendils\\" made from cotton or wool. These rectangular shawls are often woven in stripes of white and red in the region. They are wrapped around the waist to form skirts. They are also used as shawls and securing holding babies or goods on the back or front of the body. The traditional man's outer garment is the djellaba, a one-piece cotton or woolen cloak with a pointed hood. In the Jebala region, the wool is usually un-dyed so dark brown and off-white colours are common. White djellabas are worn for religious festivals. The Jebala favour pointed toed leather slippers. Natural light brown, yellow and white are the most common colours. Reed hats are another traditional feature of Jebala dress for both men and women. Women's hats are often adorned with woven woollen tassels and roping of black, white and red in variations. \\\\---- = Oral tradition = Today, the oral poetic tradition of the Jbala is known among outsiders under the generic term ayta jabaliya. At the national level, it became famous across Morocco largely thanks to the efforts of a talented poet, musician and singer of Jebli origin (tribe ‚ÄòBni Zeroual‚Äô, ÿ®ŸÜŸäÿ≤ÿ±ŸàÿßŸÑ), Mohamed Laroussi, (ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÑÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ≥Ÿä) (1933-2014), who received from his countrywide audiences the honorary titles of the 'fannƒÅn JbƒÅla‚Äô (ŸÅŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ©), or ‚Äòthe artist of the Jbala‚Äô, or ‚Äòma·∏•b≈´b JbƒÅla‚Äô (ŸÖÿ≠ÿ®Ÿàÿ®ÿ¨ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ©), or ‚Äòbeloved by all Jbala people‚Äô. For decades his songs have been available for purchase not only in northern Morocco, where Laaroussi‚Äôs name is known in every household, but throughout the country, first on LPs, then tapes, and recently on CDs and in MP3 format, Laaroussi‚Äôs concerts have been regularly shown on Moroccan television since the 1960s. Today both his audio and video records can be easily found on YouTube and other internet video hosting sites. Although pretty much everything produced in the Jbala region, is referred to as ayta jabaliya, in fact, there are three different genres: ‚Äòayta jebliya‚Äô (ÿπŸäÿ∑ÿ© ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑŸäÿ©), ‚Äòayyu‚Äô (ÿπŸäŸàÿπ ) and ‚Äòughniya‚Äô (ÿßÿ∫ŸÜŸäÿ©). Interestingly, and despite their heterogeneity, the Jbala trace their ethnic and cultural origin to the glorious times of Moorish Andalusian Spain (711-1492)Gintsburg, S. (2014). Formulaicity in Jbala poetry. Tilburg: Tilburg University Press.. Any Jbala musician and singer, who is often also a ‚Äòpoet‚Äô and even an ‚Äòartist‚Äô (because Jebli poetry does not exist without music and performance and a local poet almost always sings his own songs, accompanying himself with a musical instrument) will usually tell an outsider the legend of Tariq Bnu Ziad, the famous conqueror of Spain, his trip through the Straights of Gibraltar (Jabal Tariq, the Mountain of Tariq, hence Gibraltar), and the sad end of Arab rule in Spain. The sense of cultural continuity between the Jbala region and Andalusia is very strong even today Gintsburg, S. (2014). Formulaicity in Jbala poetry. Tilburg: Tilburg University Press.. \\\\---- = Poetry = The traditional Jebli poetry has the following general characteristics: it is practically always oral and almost always unauthored: in the traditional Jebli culture it is very unusual to hear that someone claims authorship of a particular song/poem. Poetry is often improvised but sometimes can also be memorised and then performed. Remarkably, Jebli poetry is always linked to music and performance and, perhaps because of this, is never referred to as ‚Äòpoetry‚Äô or shi‚Äôr (ÿ¥ÿπÿ±) or zajal (ÿ≤ÿ¨ŸÑ). Instead, it is routinely called klam (ŸÉŸÑÿßŸÖ), which can be roughly compared to the meaning of English ‚Äòlyrics‚Äô. At the same time, music or lhan (ŸÑÿ≠ŸÜ), is highly valued and it is always music that identifies the genreGintsburg, S. (2006). Some Observations on the poetical language of love songs in the dialect of the Jbala (northern Morocco). Al-Andalus-Magreb, 13, 139-161.. A traditional Jebli poet links his/her verses to a particular melody, from the set of possible melodies typical of this tradition. Once the melody is chosen, he/she then tries to organise his/her poetry into beyt-s (ÿ®Ÿäÿ™), or quatrains. It is not clear how well the poet understands the concept of Arabic beyt and links to it concept of qafiya (ŸÇÿßŸÅŸäÿ©), or rhyme. It is very possible that local poets use this terminology in a rather superficial way: after all, their poems only exist during the moment when they are being performed. In other words, a Jebli poem is difficult to visualise on paper and can be compared to a rather distant tradition of Classical Arabic poetry that was once born n the Arabian Peninsula. However, a Jebli beyt does have particular characteristics that the poet has in mind and tries to conform with: beyt is typically but not necessarily made of four hemistichs, where each one is made of 6-8 syllables, and the second hemistich is rhymed with the fourth one. If the beyt becomes a part of ayta jebliya or ughniya, the poet will also produce a lazima (ŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖÿ©), or refrain, that will cement the text together. This poetry has recently been analyzed within the framework of cognitive poetics, showing how spontaneous oral performance is aided by recourse to cognitive frames, scripts and formulaic language. \\\\---- = Music = Music and dancing are also very important in Jbala culture. The Jebala play the \\"Ghayta\\" (a form of clarinet), and the tbul (drum), and dancing is generally performed by boys. The Rif musicians, who belong to a socially and occupational inferior class calling themselves \\"Imdhyazen\\", generally come from one tribe, the \\"Ait Touzin\\". They play the \\"Addjun\\" (tambourine) and the \\"zammar\\" (a kind of clarinet) with unmarried girls and old women dancing. Economic and cultural differences Jebala house with thatched roof The Jebala people have a different culture compared to the Rifians. The Jebala people use oxen yoked by their horns for ploughing, opposed to the Rifians' use of cows yoked by their neck. For the roofing of their houses, the Jebala people make roofs made of corrugated iron or thatch, when the Rifians use dried clay. The Jebala who inhabit the Atlantic coast, Tangier area and the extreme west of the Rif have more rainfall, and therefore prefer pointed roof, in the Rif, where there is less rainfall flat roof is used. The Jebala have villages with houses clustered together, while the Rifians traditionally have dispersed homesteads, located at least 300 metres from each other. = Special technologies = The Rif is not just a mountainous area. Its proximity to the straits of Gibraltar gave this area an important role: the western part of the Rif is a transit route, leading to the Mediterranean world, in particular, to al-Andalus. This has had a certain impact on its inhabitants: early arabisation, a high density of literate people, the cultural and economic influence of neighbouring cities, etc.Vignet-Zunz, J. (2017), ¬´ Jbala : Identit√©s et fronti√®res ¬ª La r√©gion du Nord-Ouest marocain : parlers et pratiques sociales et culturelles / √Ångeles Vicente, Dominique Caubet, Amina Naciri-Azzouz (√©ds), Prensas de la Universidad de Zaragoza, Colecci√≥n Estudios de Dialectolog√≠a √Årabe, n.¬∫ 12, 18-28. In addition, these factors led to the emergence of technical innovations that are modest, yet surprising in the Maghreb context: sloping thatched-roofs (ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ± ÿØ ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ), identical to those found in the south of Andalusia; the yoking of horned cattle, where the yoke is placed at the base of the skull, just behind the horns (ÿ®ÿ±Ÿàÿßÿ≥Ÿä) to which it is fixed, a system which is known only in some limited areas in Europe; the haystack (ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÖŸàŸÜ) made without a cob bedding, instead held together by a set of cords fixed with stones; the granary raised on pillars (ŸÑŸáÿ±Ÿä), which exists in some other parts of the world, the closest place being in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains; the hand flour mill with connecting rod-crank (ÿ±ÿ≠Ÿä ÿØ ŸÑŸäÿØ), where an alternating movement transforms into a rotary movement, according to the mechanical principle of the connecting rod-crank; the water mill with vertical shed (ÿ±ÿ≠Ÿä ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿß), the use of which is limited to a small area on the straits of Gibraltar, unlike the ramp mill which is in use in the rest of the country; the oil press with double lateral screws (ŸÖÿπŸäÿµÿ±ÿ©), mobile because of its small size; and the piston-type butter-churn (ŸÖÿÆÿßÿ∑), with vertical movement instead of lateral Vignet-Zunz, J. (2012), ¬´ Outils insolites, outils d√©faillants et savantes montagne ¬ª, Des outils, des machines et des hommes, √âtudes offertes √† Georges COMET, √©dit√©es par Aline Durand, Cahiers d‚ÄôHistoire des Techniques, n¬∞ 8, Publications de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Provence, Aix-en-Provence.. Where did this technical originality come from? Perhaps, this heritage has been in a suitable position to resist changes: this is a well preserved area located precisely at the heart of the Rif chain. Moreover, it is shielded by the sea and, at the same time, protected from southern influences by the barrier of the great ridge. This isolation had a double effect, added to four centuries of no contact between Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula. But perhaps we should consider this entire region of northwest Morocco to be a privileged area in terms of confluences, since it combines a great diversity of natural factors with its proximity to the sea and presence on terrestrial routes. \\\\---- = Biodiversity and agriculture = The Rif is one of the most populated mountain ranges in the Mediterranean basin. The western and central parts of this area are considered as a ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù of Mediterranean biodiversity: we can speak of a true refuge of agrodiversity Hmimsa Y. & Ater M. (2008), ‚ÄúAgrodiversity in the traditional agrosystems of the Rif mountains (north of Morocco)‚Äù, Biodiversity, 9 (1-2): 78-81., where rare crops of cereals and legumes that are considered at a national level to be minor or marginal have been preserved, such as rye, or chentil (ÿ¢ÿ¥ŸÜÿ™ŸäŸÑ), small spelt or einkorn, chqalia (ÿ¥ŸÇÿßŸÑŸäÿ©), and sorghum, or dra (ÿØÿ±ÿ©), is the main spring cereal instead of the usual corn. As well as the impressive diversity of fruit trees. There are over a hundred varieties of fig trees Hmimsa Y. et al., (2012), ‚ÄúVernacular taxonomy, classification and varietal diversity of fig (Ficuscarica L.) among Jbala cultivators in Northern Morocco‚Äù, Human Ecology. DOI:10.1007/s10745-012-9471-x.. In addition, vine production has long been known in this region, evidence of which has been documented by many travellersMichaux-Bellaire E. (1911) ¬´ Quelques tribus de montagne de la r√©gion du Habt ¬ª. In Archives Marocaines, vol. 17. Paris : E. Leroux.. Today, grape syrup, known as samit (ÿµÿßŸÖÿ™), is still produced locally; often it is lightly fermented and then contains alcohol, which causes controversy about the legitimacy of its use (in the context of Islamic beliefs). The olive tree is essential and occupies 77% of the land used for tree planting. This area is also known for production of original honeys, particularly the carob and arbutus types. Wild plants are widely utilised because of their nutritional value. On the other hand, the flax and mulberry trees have disappeared and, with them, have disappeared a significant number of local crafts. At the level of agronomic practices, the local population has been successfully bringing innovation into local products. These products are of special value, given the current interest and strong demand for organic produce, as well as produce with important dietary properties, based on ancient traditions and local varieties. However, the transmission of this know-how to the new generation is proving difficultAter M. et al.

Such pilgrimages are usually made to shrines of local saints all over the Muslim world.

Each of the Jebli tribes has at least one Sufi lodge, or ‚Äòzawiya‚Äô (ÿ≤ÿßŸàŸäÿ©), adjacent to its shrine, or ‚Äòdarih‚Äô (ÿ∂ÿ±Ÿäÿ≠). Almost all zawiya-s have their season or ‚Äòmawsem‚Äô (ŸÖŸàÿ≥ŸÖ), or grand gatherings of faithful Muslims that happen on fixed dates during a particular time frame.

Targa-AIDE, Rabat.. Some saints, such as Moulay Bou Shta el-Khammar (ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸä ÿ®Ÿàÿ¥ÿ™ÿß ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÖÿßÿ±) and Sidi Allal el-Hajj (ÿ≥ŸäÿØŸä ÿπŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿßÿ¨), seem to be more reputable than others. However, there is one particular saint who is highly honoured not only by members of Jebli society but also across the Moroccan kingdom. This is Moulay Abdessalam Ben Mshish (ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸä ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿ¥Ÿäÿ¥¬ö), a native of the Jbala region. Moulay Abdessalam is the qu·π≠b al-Maƒ°rib al-aq·π£a (ŸÇÿ∑ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿµŸâ) ‚Äî‚Äòthe spiritual pole of the far Maghreb‚Äô. It is important to mention that the term qutb has a special meaning in the Islamic tradition, referring to a spiritual symbol of particular time. It is also of importance that throughout their history Sufi orders in the Kingdom of Morocco developed and evolved around only two qu·π≠bs‚ÄîMoulay Abdessalam ben Mshish, a native of the Jbala who is viewed as the ‚Äòwestern pole‚Äô, and Moulay Abdelqader Jilali, a native of Iraq who is regarded as the ‚Äòeastern pole'.Michaux-Bellaire E. (1911) ¬´ Quelques tribus de montagne de la r√©gion du Habt ¬ª. In Archives Marocaines, vol. 17. Paris : E. Leroux. In Morocco this term has acquired an extra nuance: qu·π≠bs are considered to be those who play the role of spiritual leaders for other saints. This idea is closely linked to the brotherhood of Shadhiliya, one of the most powerful Sufi orders not only in Morocco but throughout North Africa. The tradition of going on pilgrimage to the shrine of Moulay Abdessalam ben Mshish has played an exceptionally important role in Jebli society over many centuries. Traditionally, the beginning of the pilgrimage season to Moulay Abdessalam is calculated based on the Islamic calendar and takes place around the 15th of ShaabanÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ∑ : ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßÿ®Ÿä ÿ±ŸÇÿ±ÿßŸÇ ŸÑŸÑÿ∑ÿ®ÿßÿπÿ© Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ¥ÿ±. ÿπÿ®ŸäÿØŸà ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ . ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸä ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿ¥Ÿäÿ¥ ŸÇÿ∑ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿµŸâ. At this time not only do Jebli pilgrims come from all corners of the land of the Jbala but also pilgrims from other parts of Morocco. They flock to Mount Alam (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÖ).The gathering of pilgrims, also known as lamma (ŸÑÿßŸÖÿ©), is accompanied by the chanting of religious hymns and prayers, and then smoothly transforms into picnics and get-togethers of family and friends during which it is common to exchange short sung poems, or ayyu-s (ÿπŸäŸàÿπ).

Climate change and greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of arguably one of our most vital resources. Because water in its occurrence varies spatially and temporally throughout the hydrologic cycle, its study using GIS is especially practical. Whereas previous GIS systems were mostly static in their geospatial representation of hydrologic features, GIS platforms are becoming increasingly dynamic, narrowing the gap between historical data and current hydrologic reality. The elementary water cycle has inputs equal to outputs plus or minus change in storage. Hydrologists make use of this hydrologic budget when they study a watershed. The inputs in a hydrologic budget include precipitation, surface flow, and groundwater flow. Outputs consist of evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface runoff, and surface/groundwater flows. All of these quantities can be measured or estimated based on environmental data and their characteristics can be graphically displayed and studies using GIS. GIS in surface water USGS Real-Time streamflow gage locations with hyperlinks within a GIS to the data In the field of hydrological modeling, analysis generally begins with the sampling and measurement of existing hydrologic areas. In this stage of research, the scale and accuracy of measurements are key issues. Data may either be collected in the field or through online research. The United States Geological Survey ((USGS)) is a publicly available source of remotely sensed hydrological data. Historical and real-time streamflow data are also available via the internet from sources such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A benefit of using GIS softwares for hydrological modeling is that digital visualizations of data can be linked to real-time data. GIS revolutionized curation, manipulation, and input for complex computational hydrologic models For surface water modeling, digital elevation model are often layered with hydrographic data in order to determine the boundaries of a watershed . Understanding these boundaries is integral to understanding where precipitation runoff will flow. For example, in the event of snowmelt, the amount of snowfall can be input into GIS to predict the amount of water that will travel downstream . This information has applications in local government asset management, agriculture and environmental science. Another useful application for GIS regards flood risk assessment. Using digital elevation models combined with peak discharge data can predict which areas of a floodplain will be submerged depending on the amount of rainfall. In a study of the Illinois River watershed, Rabie (2014) found that a decently accurate flood risk map could be generated using only DEMs and stream gauge data. Analysis based on these two parameters alone does not account for manmade developments including levees or drainage systems, and therefore should not be considered a comprehensive result. A digital elevation model (DEM) from which a watershed may be delineated within a GIS GIS in groundwater The use of GIS to analyze groundwater falls into the field of hydrogeology. Since 98% of available freshwater on Earth is groundwater, the need to effectively model and manage these resources is apparent. As the demand for groundwater continues to increase with the world‚Äôs growing population, it is vital that these resources be properly managed. Indeed, when groundwater usage is not monitored sufficiently, it may result in damage to aquifers or groundwater-related subsidence, as occurred in the Ogallala aquifer in the United States. In some cases, GIS can be used to analyze drainage and groundwater data in order to select suitable sites for groundwater recharge.

Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that: *certain public-sector employees can have a property interest in their employment, per Constitutional Due Process. See Board of Regents v. Roth *this property right entails a right to \\"some kind of hearing\\" before being terminated‚Äîa right to oral or written notice of charges against them, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present their sides of the story. *thus, the pretermination hearing should be an initial check against mistaken decisions‚Äînot a full evidentiary hearing, but essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action. *in this case, because the respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the District Court erred in dismissing for failure to state a claim. As a result of the case, public sector employers are required to provide a Loudermill hearing and/or a Loudermill letter before terminating an employee.  Background  =Facts= This case consolidated two Sixth Circuit cases in which Ohio employees, both \\"classified civil servants\\" under Ohio law and therefore could be terminated only for cause and with entitlement to posttermination administrative review,Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ¬ß 124.11 (1984) were terminated without being afforded a pretermination hearing to respond to the charges: *In the first, a security guard (James Loudermill) employed by the Cleveland Board of Education was dismissed for failing to disclose a prior felony conviction for grand larceny on his job application. *In the second, a school bus mechanic (Richard Donnelly) for the Parma Board of Education was discharged because he failed an eye examination. =Loudermill's early appeals= Loudermill filed an appeal with the Cleveland Civil Service Commission, which, after hearings before a referee and the Commission, upheld the dismissal some nine months after the appeal had been filed. Although the Commission's decision was subject to review in the state courts, Loudermill instead filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Loudermill alleged that Sec. 124.34, the Ohio statute providing for administrative review, was unconstitutional on its face because it provided no opportunity for a discharged employee to respond to charges against him prior to removal, thus depriving him of liberty and property without due process. It was also alleged that the statute was unconstitutional as applied because discharged employees were not given sufficiently prompt postremoval hearings. The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, holding that because the very statute that created the property right in continued employment also specified the procedures for discharge, and because those procedures were followed, Loudermill was, by definition, afforded all the process due; that the post-termination hearings also adequately protected Loudermill's property interest; and that in light of the Commission's crowded docket the delay in processing his appeal was constitutionally acceptable. =Donnelly's early appeals= Richard Donnelly appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which ordered him reinstated a year later without backpay. The District Court, relying on Loudermill's case, dismissed Donnelly's constitutional challenge for failure to state a claim. =Sixth Circuit= On a consolidated appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed in part and remanded. The Court held that both respondents had been deprived of due process and that the compelling private interest in retaining employment, combined with the value of presenting evidence prior to dismissal, outweighed the added administrative burden of a pretermination hearing. But with regard to the alleged deprivation of liberty and Loudermill's 9-month wait for an administrative decision, the court affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding no constitutional violation.  Opinion of the Court  On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed and remanded. The majority opinion was written by Justice White, joined by Burger, Blackmun, Powell, Stevens, and O'Connor. =Holding= The Court held that all the process that is due is provided by a pretermination opportunity to respond, coupled with post-termination administrative procedures as provided by the Ohio statute. Since respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the District Court erred in dismissing their complaints for failure to state a claim. =Reasoning= In Part II, the Court found that tenured public employees (as characterized in the Ohio statute) \\"plainly\\" had a property interest in continued employment. Furthermore, the scope of this property interest was not determined by the procedures provided for its deprivation: The Due Process Clause provides that the substantive rights of life, liberty, and property cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures; since the categories of substance and procedure are distinct, \\"property\\" cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation. ::The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution provides that certain substantive rights such as life, liberty, and property, cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures. The categories of substance and procedure are distinct. Were the rule otherwise, the Clause would be reduced to a mere tautology. \\"Property\\" cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation any more than can life or liberty. The right to due process is conferred, not by legislative grace, but by constitutional guarantee. While the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest in public employment, it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards. In Part III, the Court‚Äîreiterating that the essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to respond‚Äîfound that employees who have such a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment are entitled to \\"some kind of hearing\\" before being terminated. The need for some form of pretermination hearing is evident from a balancing of the competing interests at stake: the private interest in retaining employment, the governmental interests in expeditious removal of unsatisfactory employees and the avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous termination. In Part IV, the Court determined the scope of the required pretermination hearing: it need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge, but should be an initial check against mistaken decisions‚Äîessentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action. This arises from the essential requirements of due process, notice and an opportunity to respond. Thus, the employees were entitled to a pretermination opportunity to respond but not to a full evidentiary hearing. The employees were entitled to oral or written notice of charges against them, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present their sides of the story. Because the respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the District Court erred in dismissing for failure to state a claim. The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution provided that certain substantive rights, such as life, liberty, and property, could not be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures. The Court held that all the process that was due was provided by a pretermination opportunity to respond, coupled with post-termination administrative proceedings as provided by Ohio statute. As respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the district court erred in dismissing for failure to state a claim. In Part V, the court found that a 9-month delay in Loudermill's posttermination hearing did not constitute a separate due process violation. The Due Process Clause requires provision of a hearing \\"at a meaningful time,\\" and here the delay stemmed in part from the thoroughness of the procedures. Concurrence Justice Marshall concurred in Part II and in the judgment, stating that before a decision is made to terminate an employee's wages, the employee should be entitled to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses and to present witnesses on his own behalf whenever there are substantial disputes in testimonial evidence. Justice Brennan concurred in part and dissented in part, expressing the view that the record was insufficiently developed to permit an informed judgment on the issue of administrative delay and that the security guard's case should be remanded for further evidentiary proceedings. Dissent Justice Rehnquist dissented, expressing the view that the Fourteenth Amendment does not support the conclusion that the state's effort to confer a limited form of tenure upon the employees resulted in the creation of a \\"property right\\" in their employment.
