Also playing for Ph√∂nix L√ºbeck that season was defender Peter Nogly, who would later become Stars' teammate twice more at Hamburg and Tampa Bay.Homann, Ulrich. (1990). H√∂llenglut an Himmelfahrt .

Stars played there from 1971 to 1977, and under coach Helmuth Johannsen the V√∂lklingen squad twice finished as runner-up 1972 and 1973 in the Bundesliga promotion round. In 1974 his team gained promotion to the 2. Bundesliga South. Between 1974 and 1977, he played in 112 league games at V√∂lklingen.Hoffmann, BF. (2003). Das gro√üe Lexikon der Bundesligatorh√ºter.

However, he saw limited action in three seasons, serving mostly as the back-up to Rudi Kargus, who was a fixture in goal at HSV. He only played two league games, but was a member of Hamburg's 1979 Bundesliga champion team.http://hsv-history.de/tag/juergen-stars While in HSV he appeared in several DFB-Pokal matches and one Cup Winners' Cup match. He also played in the first leg of the 1977 European Super Cup, a 1‚Äì1 draw against Liverpool F.C. In 1980 Stars moved to newly promoted second division side VfR B√ºrstadt. There he appeared in 25 matches, helping VfR to 13th place in the table. However, since it was the final year that the 2. Bundesliga used the two-track system, Buerstadt was nevertheless relegated in the Amateur Oberliga Hessen for 1981‚Äì82.Weinrich, Matthias (2001). Zweitliga-Almanach. Kassel, Germany. Agon-Sportverlag. Beginning in 1981 Stars also played four years in the NASL, initially for the Calgary Boomers. He then briefly returned to Hamburg before joining Tampa Bay Rowdies during their march to 1981‚Äì82 indoor finals. He played three indoor seasons and two outdoor campaigns in Tampa, before moving on to the Tulsa Roughnecks for the 1984 outdoor season.

It was created in response to the race-motivated violence in Charleston, South Carolina on the evening of June 17, 2015, when Dylann Roof opened fire during a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, killing 9 people. These texts provide information about racial violence in the United States and provide background on the history of race relations in South Carolina in particular and the United States in general. They also offer education on race, racial identities, global white supremacy and black resistance. Several of the suggested readings shed light on race and racism on a global scale. On June 23, 2015, NPR's Renee Montagne reported on Morning Edition that \\"academics, librarians and history students have been rallying around the hashtag Charleston Syllabus, suggesting readings that might help inform the public of some of the city's history.\\" \\"#Charlestonsyllabus is more than a list. It is a community of people committed to critical thinking, truth telling and social transformation.‚Äù‚Äì Chad Williams \\"In so many ways, the #Charlestonsyllabus is a testament to the power of Twitter as a central medium for educators to engage and strategize with members of the general public. What the #Charlestonsyllabus has done is bring together people from all walks of life who are deeply committed to social justice and determined to make a difference.\\"- Keisha N. Blain Background Twitter campaigns utilizing hashtags to generate crowdsourced lists of information sources widely excluded from academic canons emerged throughout 2014 and 2015. The most notable example of this trend is the #FergusonSyllabus, created by Georgetown University Professor Marcia Chatelain in the aftermath of the Ferguson uprising. The #CharlestonSyllabus campaign was the brainchild of Chad Williams, Associate Professor of African and Afro- American Studies at Brandeis University. The concept came from a tweet of his: \\"Lots of ignorance running rampant. Folks need a #CharlestonSyllabus.\\" Williams later stated that Roof's killing spree brought national attention to the country's history of racial injustice. Historians Keisha N. Blain, Kidada Williams, and others helped to circulate the hashtag and #CharlestonSyllabus started trending on Twitter by the evening of June 19, 2015. With the assistance of librarians Melissa Morrone, Ryan P. Randall, and Cecily Walker, Blain compiled and organized the reading list on the website of the African American Intellectual History Society (AAIHS). Within the first day of use, the hashtag generated approximately 10,000 tweets. Librarians across the nation assisted in culling and categorizing suggestions made via Twitter, also tagging the entries in WorldCat, a web resource for locating materials at nearby libraries, on the AAIHS website. More than 115, 000 visitors have accessed the list and several libraries across the country have featured #Charlestonsyllabus displays. Since its debut, the #Charlestonsyllabus has been featured on major news outlets including BBC, PBS, NPR, LA Times, New York Times, and the Chronicle of Higher Education. Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha N. Blain recently edited a book based on the syllabus entitled Charleston Syllabus: Readings on Race, Racism, and Racial Violence (University of Georgia Press, 2016). =Twitter Historians= The emergence of academic crowdsourcing on Twitter can, in large part, be contributed to the #Twitterstorians and #BLKTwitterstorians hashtag trends. In February 2014, the Pew Research Center defined six different kinds of network crowds, which they called \\"conversational archetypes\\", on Twitter, using NodeXL. The Twitterstorians channel is what the research defines as a \\"tight crowd network\\". References External links  * Keisha N.

The film focuses on Jack Stanley who is disinherited by this father, Lord Stanley, for refusing to marry his cousin. Jack heads to America and takes a job as a groom. He is dismissed from his position after his employer learns of Jack's affections for his daughter, Ann. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley decides to reinstate Jack in his will and then promptly dies, giving him his entire fortune. Jack reads of his father's death in the newspaper and learns of his father's will. The film concludes with the lawyer bringing Jack to a dinner party as \\"Lord Stanley\\". Ann's father wishes for her to earn his affections, but she is defiant and does not even look at him. Once she learns it his Jack, they kiss. The scenario was written by Lloyd Lonergan and the only known actor is Justus D. Barnes as Ann's father. A surviving print of the film exists in the Library of Congress and it shows the improvement of the Thanhouser interior sets over films from months prior. The film was released on October 25, 1910, and was met with mixed reviews.  Plot  Jack Stanley is disinherited by his father, Lord Stanley, because he refuses to marry his cousin, Lady Maude. Jack emigrates to America, but has no money and has no job upon which to sustain himself. While pondering his actions, he witnesses a trio of riders approach and speak to him. He accepts a position as a groom for a wealthy American, but he falls in love with his daughter, Ann. When her father learns of this, he dismisses Jack and Ann says she will never marry anyone but him. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley has come to forgive his son and decided to reinstate him in his will. No sooner has the task been completed does Lord Stanley suddenly dies. Upon reading the paper, Jack sees an advertisement about the heir of the late Lord Stanley. He heads to Hotel Astor and learns that he has received his father's entire fortune. The lawyer accepts a dinner invitation at the wealthy American's house and brings along Jack. The father urges his daughter to win the affections of the rich, handsome and unmarried young Lord Stanley. Upon his arrival, the father who had shunned him is taken aback and greets him, but Ann refuses to even look at the guest. She ignores him, and refuses to face him even as they head towards the dining room, but Jack attempts to kiss her and she pulls away. Suddenly, Ann sees it is Jack and embraces him with a kiss.  Cast  *Jack (Young Lord Stanley) - Unknown actor *Lord Stanley - Unknown actor *Ann (the girl) - Unknown actress *Justus D. Barnes as Ann's father *Snaith the lawyer - Unknown actor  Production  The script for the production was written by Lloyd Lonergan, an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The production of the film shows the continuing improvement of Thanhouser works, specifically for more realistic interior scenes, over those shot in the months prior. The progress referred to here is the improvement from works like The Two Roses. The interior sets are still very small, but the exterior shots show strength in their variety. Bowers believes that the uncommon surname, Snaith, is of some importance to Lonergan because of its reoccurring usage, including the titled works Miss Arabella Snaith and Professor Snaith. An analysis of the frame showing the newspaper advertisement shows that it was from a real newspaper dated from September 21, 1910. The title of the film might possibly be a reference to \\"Lord Stanley\\", the courtesy title of the heir apparent of the Earl of Derby. At the time of the production Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley, was \\"Lord Stanley\\".  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 25, 1910. The film was originally released a Young Lord Stanley, but the surviving print from the Library of Congress has \\"His Only Son\\" as what appears to be the title of the print. Bowers notes that this first card is in a different format from the other inter-titles which follow and may have been a replacement or alternate name for the print. The surviving print is 928 feet long, and its shown length is 13 minutes and 35 seconds. The film likely had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Kansas, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Walton of The Moving Picture News said the film was, \\"A bright, clean, human interest tale. It holds the attention from beginning to end. A thoroughly commendable reel - in every way.\\" The Moving Picture World offers a summary of the work and was more or less neutral in its review of the film. The reviewer states, \\"It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot in a number of different directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, a travesty upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the \\"common fault of actors\\" by throwing things on the floor and how Ann's refusal to even look at the titled guest was overdone.

The 10th Mountain Division‚Äôs headquarters, in turn, would command all land forces inside Afghanistan. Major General Franklin L. Hagenbeck, commanding general, 10th Mountain Division, later recalled that the entire process of choosing his headquarters for CFLCC (Forward) had been improvised, providing little time for his staff to prepare. CFLCC (Forward) later became CJTF Mountain. It was this headquarters that ran Operation Anaconda. The mission of CJTF-180 was to conduct operations to destroy remaining Al Qaeda/hostile Taliban command control and other hostile anti-Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan elements, trains Afghan National Army, and conducts directed information operations, civil military operations and humanitarian assistance operations in coordination with the ITGA in order to establish a stable and secure Afghanistan able to deter/defeat the re-emergence of terrorism. In mid 2003 (\\"weeks\\" after 1 May 2003) McNeill and the bulk of his staff from the XVIII Airborne Corps that had formed the core of CJTF-180 departed Afghanistan.U.S. Army, A Different Kind of War, 237. Command of CJTF 180 and its 11,000 personnel was passed to Major General John R. Vines, who had recently commanded Combined Task Force 82 (CTF 82). On 27 May 2003 Lieutenant General McNeill turned over command of CJTF-180 to Major General Vines.DKW, 238. CTF 82, mostly drawn from the 82nd Airborne Division, had begun redeploying to the United States in April. Beginning in May 2003, the 10th Mountain Division headquarters and other combat and support elements of the division arrived to replace the departing forces, but this transition would take most of the summer. The 10th Mountain Division headquarters then became the staff for CJTF-180, still under Major General Vines, significantly reducing the size and capacity of the senior military command in Afghanistan. In September 2003 Brigadier General Lloyd J. Austin arrived in Afghanistan as commander of the 10th Mountain Division and Commander CJTF 180.Koontz, Christopher N. Enduring Voices: Oral Histories of the US Army Experience in Afghanistan, 2003‚Äì2005. Government Printing Office, 2008, 14. Then Major General David Barno arrived in Afghanistan in early October 2003 on temporary duty status. He spent roughly six weeks there as a two-star officer.Enduring Voices, 14. In November 2003, Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan (CFC-A) was established as the U.S. led, coalition headquarters for Afghanistan. Now-Lieutenant General Barno took command. CTJF-180 was restructured as a subordinate organization of CFC-A, with the 10th Mountain Division seemingly remaining responsible for tactical combat/security operations only. One of the pillars of Barno's new counter- insurgency strategy was to order the troops to live alongside the people,Fred Kaplan, The Insurgents, 320. and thus he allotted brigades to specific areas of responsibility, creating Regional Command East and Regional Command South.Enduring Voices Previously the forces had conducted missions hunting insurgents without establishing long-term relationships with specific areas. Department of Defense Authorization Appropriation statements for FY 2005 describe \\"...CJTF-180 is a division level organization that exercises command over 11 separate task forces; including 2 coalition battalions and other support, medical, engineering, and training units. It also has special operations capabilities assigned from U.S. and coalition nations.\\" On 15 April 2004 the headquarters of the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division arrived in Afghanistan and took command of CJTF-180 from the 10th Mountain Division. Lieutenant General Barno then decided to rename the CJTF because the ‚Äú180‚Äù designation had traditionally been given to Joint task forces led by the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps. Barno chose Combined Joint Task Force 76 as the new name to evoke America‚Äôs history and the democratic spirit of 1776.Lieutenant General David W. Barno, interview by Center for Military History, 21 November 2006, 31‚Äì32, in A Different Kind of War. The CFC-A commander was hoping that this new designation would highlight the change in command at the operational level at a time when Afghanistan appeared to be moving closer to democracy. Rotations Operation Enduring Freedom I - Combined Joint Task Force Mountain, October 2001 to June 2002 = Command and Control 10th Mountain Division From October 2001 to June 2002, Combined Joint Task Force Mountain's primary mission was in response to the September 11 attacks. The significance of the mission was the overthrow the Taliban's government of Afghanistan and reestablish a representative Afghanistan National government. Included in this mission were the significant Joint Special Forces operations working in cooperation with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. Operations began in October 2001 when 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment deployed to Uzbekistan and established operations and securing Karshi-Khanabad Air Base and serving as the Quick reaction force (QRF) in support of Special forces. Major Combat Operations Between November 2001 and February 2002, the Taliban government was overthrown. Military operations primarily performed by the Afghanistan Northern Alliance, supported by the 5th Special Forces Group, and other coalition and United States special operations forces, with significant firepower provided by the United States and Coalition Air Force and Navy. This operation resulted in the fall of the Taliban government. During Operation Anaconda, military operations directed against a large Taliban defensive position and stronghold in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot Valley south of the city of Gardez in eastern Afghanistan. Directed by the 10th Mountain Division, this consisted of a deliberate assault by Afghanistan forces supported by US and Coalition Special Operation Forces, and elements of the 10th Mountain Division and 101st Airborne Division. This resulted in the heaviest fighting since U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan began. Operation Mountain Lion began 15 April 2002 and involved Afghan National Army and US and Coalition Forces performing search operations in the Gardez and Khost regions. Significant participation by the Royal Marines in this operation was known as Operation Jacana. Operation Snipe began in May 2002 to search and clear a significant area in the remote Afghan mountains believed to be used as a base by Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. During Operation Snipe, a major cave network was discovered and destroyed. Major units involved: *5th Special Forces Group *United States Army *2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, including units 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment and 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment *Task Force Rakkasan 187th Infantry Regiment (United States) of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division *Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry *British 45th Commando Group (Royal Marines) * Other United States and Coalition Special Operations Forces from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, and Norway *United States Air Force *United States Navy *Northern Alliance in Afghanistan = Operation Enduring Freedom II, June 2002 to January 2003 = From June 2002 to January 2003, CJTF 180's mission was to conduct full-spectrum operations to prevent the reemergence of terror organizations and set the conditions for the growth of democracy in Afghanistan. A major effort was placed on organizing, equipping, arming and training the Afghan National Army. The CJTF headquarters was formed by Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps (United States) under Lieutenant General Dan K. McNeill. McNeill took control of all civil-military operations by taking command of the Combined Joint Civil Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF).A Different Kind of War, 211. CJTF-180 also gained operational control (OPCON) over Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan (CJSOTF-A), the SOF headquarters established earlier in 2002 when Joint Special Operations Task Force‚ÄìNorth (JSOTF-N) and Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force‚ÄìSouth (CJSOTF-S) had combined. Since the spring, the Soldiers of the CJSOTF had played a critical role in the training of the ANA and this effort continued after CJTF-180 arrived. But McNeill gave greater emphasis to the overall ANA program by taking formal control of the Office of Military Cooperation‚ÄìAfghanistan (OMC-A) from the US Embassy. In mid 2002 there was both a combat division HQ and combat brigade rotation. By July 2002 the tactical-level units from the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne Division, including TF Rakkasan, had all departed Afghanistan; the CTF Mountain headquarters staff followed in early September. They were replaced by Combined Task Force 82, formed from the headquarters of the 82d Airborne Division and led by the division‚Äôs commander, Major General John R. Vines. CTF 82‚Äôs headquarters was at Bagram Airfield, and Vines based Task Force Panther, his primary maneuver element, at Kandahar Airfield. Task Force Panther was under the command of Colonel James L. Huggins and included two infantry battalions from the 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division and one attached infantry battalion from the division‚Äôs 1st Brigade. Huggins also enjoyed support from artillery, aviation, military intelligence, and other enabling units. Task Force Panther deployed to Afghanistan in late June 2002 and would serve under CTF 82 until 5 December 2002. At that point Task Force Devil, a unit formed around the 1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division arrived to become the lead combat/security formation. The 82nd Airborne Division joined with United States Army Rangers and other Coalition Special Forces to conduct Operation Mountain Sweep in August 2002, mounting five combat air Air assault missions.See Colin Robinson, 'Adjusting to Twenty-First Century Warfare,' New Zealand International Review, Vol. XXIX, No. 6, November‚ÄìDecember 2004, 21. Combat Engineer, Aviation, and Civil Affairs Detachments also took part in the operation. Military search operations were performed south of cities of Khost and Gardez. Five Taliban weapon caches and two Taliban document caches were discovered. However the aggressiveness of the 82nd Airborne Division personnel was compared unfavourably by Afghans with the Special Forces they had seen before. In early October 2002, the 3-505 PIR used FOB Salerno to launch Operation VILLAGE SEARCH.A Different Kind of War, 216. This operation focused on four villages near the Pakistani border suspected of harboring both Taliban fighters and weapons caches. But to engage the villages, the paratroopers used techniques that were less aggressive than those used during MOUNTAIN SWEEP, indicating that they had paid attention to the comments made by the ODAs after that operation. During VILLAGE SEARCH, unit leaders explained their intentions to village elders, asked permission to search homes, and had female Soldiers search the women. In addition, while searches were in progress, CA teams politely inquired about medical conditions and the general needs of the villages to identify potential reconstruction projects. From January to February 2003, CJTF-180 conducted Operation Mongoose, search and sweep operations intended to locate and engage Taliban and insurgent forces in the Adi Ghar Mountain Range southeast of Kandahar. From February to March 2003 Operation Viper aimed to search Afghanistan villages and recover weapons caches and other war marteriall left by Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Search and sweep operations conducted to locate and engage Taliban and insurgent forces in the Baghran and Baghni Valleys, northwest of Kana. In March 2003, Operation Valiant Strike directed to clear and search villages, gather intelligence, search for weapons caches, and seek out remaining Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. The combined forces moved through part of Southern Afghanistan to eliminate enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. Search and sweep operations intended to locate and engage Taliban and insurgent forces east of Kandahar in the Sami Ghar Mountains, performed by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and other units of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division along with Romanian Infantry and Afghan troops. Major Units Involved: *3rd Special Forces Group (United States) *United States Army *28th Public Affairs Detachment, United States Army *3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division *45 Commando Group, British Royal Marines *United States Army Rangers *Coalition Special Operations Forces from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, and Norway *United States Air Force *United States Navy = Operation Enduring Freedom IV - Combined Joint Task Force 180, July 2003 to May 2004 = Command and Control 10th Mountain Division From July 2003 to May 2004, CJTF-180 continued security and stabilization operations in Afghanistan to support development of representative Afghanistan Government. Major Combat Operations From August to September 2003 during Operation Mountain Viper, the Afghan National Army supported by the 10th Mountain Division performed sweep and search operations in Dey Chopan District, Zabul Province to uncover hundreds of suspected Taliban rebels dug in the mountains resulted in 124 militants killed. Operation Mountain Resolve, performed by the Afghan National Army and supported by the 10th Mountain Division, conducted sweep and search operations in the Nuristan and Kunar Province's in the Hindu Kush Mountain Range in November 2003. During Operation Mountain Blizzard, performed by the Afghan National Army and supported by the 10th Mountain Division conducted sweep and search operations from January to March 2004. During this operation, the coalition conducted 1,731 patrols and 143 raids and cordon-and-search operations. They killed 22 enemy combatants and discovered caches with 3,648 rockets, 3,202 mortar rounds, 2,944 rocket-propelled grenade's, 3,000 rifle rounds, 2,232 mines and tens of thousands of rounds of small-arms ammunition. Operation Mountain Storm started in March 2004 following the completion of Operation Mountain Blizzard, and was a similar operation in Khost Province. The 2nd Marine Regiment and 8th Marine Regiment also participated in this operation. Major Units Involved: *Afghan National Army *1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (including 1st Battalion, 501st Airborne Infantry Regiment, 172nd Infantry Brigade from Alaska) *2nd Marine Regiment *8th Marine Regiment *Romanian 151st and 208th Infantry Battalions *Task Force Ares (French special forces) *United States and Coalition Special Operations Forces *United States Air Force *United States Navy Commanders *Lieutenant General Dan K.

Research conducted in Beijing and Guilin, China. Guggenheim Fellowship , 1986‚Äì87. Research conducted in Taiwan. From 1992 to 2007, he was Editor, Late Imperial China. Education and career William Rowe grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where his father was president of a small local savings bank. He attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he majored in English, taking his A.B. in 1967. He later confessed however, that although he learned a great deal he didn't do the assigned reading. Out of college, he was drafted and entered Officer Candidate School. He was a U.S. Naval Officer, 1968‚Äì71. He first served in Newport, Rhode Island, as a communications officer, and was then assigned to a riverboat squadron in Vietnam, but the squadron was lost before he could join it. He was reassigned to Subic Bay, the major United States base in the Philippines. Riding in a military bus, all along the side of the road he saw farmers plowing fields with water buffalo: \\" I could have been on Mars. I had no idea people still did that,\\" he recalled. He spent the rest of his tour in the base library reading about Asia. When he returned home, he took a job as a construction worker, but quit to attend a summer school class in Chinese language at Columbia University. The language instructor insisted that he join the university's graduate program, where he studied with C. Martin Wilbur. He finished his degree in 1980, and taught briefly at University of North Carolina, Charlotte. In 1982, he joined Johns Hopkins University, where he was the only China scholar in the history department for most of his career. Reception and influence Rowe's scholarship on specialized topics in Qing history contributes to larger questions. Rowe's initial two volumes on the mid-Yangzi commercial city of Hankow during the Qing dynasty set out to show how capitalist organization, political institutions, and legal self-regulation were present, just as they were in the West. They were welcomed as contributions to the debate on whether urbanization was much the same historical process around the world or whether the city played different roles in each society. David Buck, writing in the Journal of Asian Studies, called the first volume \\"a landmark in the study of Chinese urbanism and capitalism,\\" showing him to be \\"an historian of great talent.\\" Reviewers endorsed Rowe challenge to earlier interpretations. The sociologist Max Weber wrote early in the 20th century that in effect the city in China played no role at all, for cities in China were not cities in the Western sense; they were merely seats of administrative power, not self-governing organizations. In the West, argued Weberians, cities were centers of the emerging bourgeoisie, rational behavior, and economic development. Buck writes that Rowe's works also oppose two other orthodox arguments. One, common in Marxist histories, saw the business class in late imperial China as being so \\"feudal\\" and oppressive that Chinese capitalism was suppressed. The second, common among Western observers, was that the development of Chinese capitalism derived from the impact of the West. Susan Mann wrote in the Journal of Urban History that \\"on every count, as Rowe conclusively demonstrates, the history of Hankow between 1706 and 1890 proves Weber wrong.\\" Hankow's merchants and urban citizens developed independent of foreign inspiration, though indirectly affected by foreign trade along the coast. Personal life In 1980, he married Jill A. Friedman, whom he met in Chinese language class. They have a son Joshua, born 1983, a daughter Sara, born 1986.

AMS has been an organized effort of specialists in infectious diseases, both in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics with their respective peer-organizations, hospital pharmacists, the public health community and their professional organizations since the late 1990s. It has first been implemented in hospitals. In the U.S., within the context of physicians' prescribing freedom (choice of prescription drugs), AMS had largely been voluntary self-regulation in the form of policies and appeals to adhere to a prescribing self-discipline until 2017, when the Joint Commission prescribed that hospitals should have an Antimicrobial Stewardship team, which was expanded to the outpatient setting in 2020. As of 2019, California and Missouri had made AMS programs mandatory by law. Definition and goals The 2007 definition by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) defines AMS as a \\"set of coordinated strategies to improve the use of antimicrobial medications with the goal to * enhance patient health outcomes, * reduce antibiotic resistance, and * decrease unnecessary costs\\". Decreasing the overuse of antimicrobials is expected to serve the following goals: * improve patient outcomes, especially patient safety * decrease adverse drug reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or kidney or heart damage (e.g., QT prolongation). * decrease antibiotic- associated disease, such as Clostridium difficile‚Äìassociated diarrhea, other antibiotic-associated diarrheas, and invasive candidiasis * guard the patient's microbiome, including the gut flora, respiratory tract flora, urogenital tract flora, and skin flora (this is closely related to the preceding goal of preventing antibiotic-associated disease) * decrease wasted costs * slow the increase in antimicrobial resistance * prevent unforeseen environmental degradation, such as likely adverse effects of altering biotas and animal microbiotas by pervading the water cycle with antimicrobials in wastewater History Antimicrobial misuse was recognized as early as the 1940s, when Alexander Fleming remarked on penicillin's decreasing efficacy, because of its overuse. In 1966, the first systematic assessment of antibiotic use in the Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada general hospital was published: Medical records were reviewed during two non-consecutive four-month periods (medicine, psychiatry, urology, gynecology and surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ear, nose and throat, and ophthalmology). Information was coded on punched cards using 78 columns. Others in 1968 estimated that 50% of antimicrobial use was either unnecessary or inappropriate This figure is likely the lower end of the estimate, and continues to be referenced as of 2015. In the 1970s the first clinical pharmacy services were established in North American hospitals. The first formal evaluation of antibiotic use in children regarding antibiotic choice, dose and necessity of treatment was undertaken at The Children's Hospital of Winnipeg. Researchers observed errors in therapy in 30% of medical orders and 63% of surgical orders. The most frequent error was unnecessary treatment found in 13% of medical and 45% of surgical orders. The authors stated \\"Many find it difficult to accept that there are standards against which therapy may be judged.\\" In the 1980s the antibiotic class of cephalosporins was introduced, further increasing bacterial resistance. During this decade infection control programs began to be established in hospitals, which systematically recorded and investigated hospital-acquired infections. Evidence-based treatment guidelines and regulation of antibiotic use surfaced. Australian researchers published the first medical guideline outcomes research. The term AMS was coined in 1996 by two internists at Emory University School of Medicine, John McGowan and Dale Gerding, a specialist on C. difficile. They suggested \\"...large-scale, well-controlled trials of antimicrobial use regulation employing sophisticated epidemiologic methods, molecular biological organism typing, and precise resistance mechanism analysis [...] to determine the best methods to prevent and control this problem [antimicrobial resistance] and ensure our optimal antimicrobial use stewardship\\" and that \\"...the long-term effects of antimicrobial selection, dosage, and duration of treatment on resistance development should be a part of every antimicrobial treatment decision.\\" In 1997, SHEA and the Infectious Diseases Society of America published guidelines to prevent antimicrobial resistance arguing that \\"‚Ä¶appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, that includes optimal selection, dose, and duration of treatment, as well as control of antibiotic use, will prevent or slow the emergence of resistance among microorganisms.\\" Ten years later, in 2007, bacterial, antiviral and antifungal resistance had risen to such a degree that the CDC rang the alarm . The same year, IDSA and SHEA published guidelines for developing an AMS program. Also in 2007, the first pediatric publication used the term AMS. A survey of pediatric infectious disease consultants in 2008 by the Emerging Infectious Disease Network revealed that only 45 (33%) respondents had an AMS program, mostly from before 2000, and another 25 (18%) planned an ASP (data unpublished). In 2012, the SHEA, IDSA and PIDS published a joint policy statement on AMS. The CDC's NHSN has been monitoring antimicrobial use and resistance in hospitals that volunteer to provide data. On September 18, 2014, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order 13676, \\"Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria.' This Executive Order charged a Task Force to develop a 5-Year Action Plan that included steps to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ensure continued availability of effective therapies for infections. Improved antimicrobial stewardship is one of the charges of this Executive Order. The Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) was formed in response to this Executive Order. In 2014, the CDC recommended, that all US hospitals have an antibiotic stewardship program. On January 1, 2017 Joint Commission regulations went into effect detailing that hospitals should have an Antimicrobial Stewardship team consisting of infection preventionist(s), pharmacist(s), and a practitioner to write protocols and develop projects focused on the appropriate use of antibiotics. Effective January 1, 2020, the Joint Commission antimicrobial stewardship requirements were expanded to outpatient health care organizations as well. Locations AMS is needed wherever antimicrobials are prescribed in human medicine, namely in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and long term care institutions, including hospice. Guidelines for prudent or judicious use in veterinary medicine have been developed by the Canadian Veterinary Medicine Association in 2008. A particular problem is that veterinarians are both prescribers and dispensers. Regulators and the veterinary community in the European Union have been discussing the separation of these activities. Participants Antimicrobial stewardship focuses on prescribers, be it physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, on the prescription and the microorganism, if any. At a hospital, AMS can be organized in the form of an AMS committee that meets monthly. The day-to-day work is done by a core group, usually an infectious disease physician, who may or may not serve in hospital epidemiology and infection control, or/ and an infectious diseases or antimicrobial certified pharmacist, ideally but rarely aided by an information technologist. In most cases, both the infectious diseases physician and the infectious diseases pharmacist co-chair the AMS committee and both serve as the directors and champions of the AMS program and committee. The entire committee may include physician representatives, who are top antimicrobial prescribers such as physicians in intensive care medicine, Hematology -Oncology, cystic fibrosis clinicians or hospitalists, a microbiologist, a quality improvement (QI) specialist, and a representative from hospital administration. Six infectious diseases organizations, SHEA, Infectious Diseases Society of America, MAD-ID, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases PIDS, and Society of Infectious Disease Pharmacists, published joint guidance for the knowledge and skills required for antimicrobial stewardship leaders. For an AMS program to be established the institution has to recognize its value. In the US it has become customary to present a business plan to the executive officers of the hospital administration. Program components The CDC recommends essential components of AMS programs for acute care hospitals, small and critical access hospitals, resource-limited facilities, long-term care facilities, and outpatient facilities. As of 2014, thirteen internet-based institutional ASP resources in US academic medical centers had been published. An AMS program has the following tasks, in line with quality improvement theory: = Baseline assessment= Parts of the baseline assessment are to: *Measure baseline antimicrobial use, dosing, duration, costs and use patterns. *Study type of microbial isolates, susceptibilities, and trends thereof *Identify clinician indications for prescriptions. In hospitals and clinics using electronic medical records, information technology resources are crucial to focusing on these questions. As of 2015, commercial computer surveillance software programs for microbiology and antimicrobial administrations appear to outnumber \\"homegrown\\" institutional programs, and include, but are not limited to TREAT Steward, TheraDoc, Sentri7, and Vigilanz. =Goals of desirable antimicrobial use= For the desired antimicrobial use, goals need to be formulated: *Define \\"appropriate\\", rational antimicrobial use for the institution, individual patient units, and define empiric treatment versus culture-directed antimicrobial treatment. *Establish treatment guidelines for clinical syndromes. These can be disseminated in the form of memos, in- services or grand rounds and may be most effective in the form of decision making tools at the point of ordering the prescription. =Interventions on antimicrobial prescribing= The actual interventions on antimicrobial prescribing consist of numerous elements =Provide feedback, continuing education= *Survey prescriber knowledge about antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral drugs. *Provide targeted education about particular antibiotics, or one specific antimicrobial at a time, as well as empiric treatment for syndromes versus culture directed treatment. *Assist in making duration more visible to prescribers. Some institutions use automatic stop orders. *Decreasing diagnostic uncertainty by appropriate testing, including rapid diagnostic methods. The most effective strategy to decrease diagnostic uncertainty would be to align the focus with other safety projects, and QI measures (e.g. blood management, adverse effects etc.). Biomerieux has published case studies of countries that introduced AMS.Be SMART with Resistance, Biomerieux, Intern. Newsletter October 2013, 8 pp Interventions The day-to-day work of the core AMS members is to screen patients' medical records for some of the following questions, in order of importance: *Appropriate antimicrobial choice based on susceptibility, avoiding redundance ? *Appropriate dose (mg/kg dosing in children) ? *Appropriate dosing interval according to age, weight and renal function or drug-drug interaction? *Appropriate deescalation of antimicrobials after culture results are final ? *Appropriate administration route and feasibility of drug conversion from intravenous to by mouth (PO)? If the answer is no, the team needs to effectively communicate a recommendation, which may be in person or in the medical record. Further tasks are: *Automatic review of the medical record after 72h empiric use, culture results, other laboratory data *Advise on appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy *Annual report to administration, calculation of cost savings if any. Outcomes to measure In 2010, two pediatric infectious disease physicians suggested to look at the following variables to judge the outcome of AMS interventions: * Annual pharmacy acquisition costs * Antibiotic days/1,000 patient days * Identifying \\"drug-bug mismatches\\" * IV to oral conversion * Optimal dosing * Stopping redundant therapy * Reducing adverse events * Overall compliance with ASP recommendations When examining the relationship between an outcome and an intervention, the epidemiological method of time series analysis is preferred, because it accounts for the dependence between time points. A review of 825 studies evaluating any AMS intervention in a community or hospital setting revealed a low overall quality of antimicrobial stewardship studies, most not reporting clinical and microbiological outcome data. A 2014 global stewardship survey identified barriers to the initiation, development and implementation of stewardship programmes internationally.Howard P. et al., ESCMID Study Group for Antimicrobial Policies (ESGAP) & ISC. Group on Antimicrobial Stewardship ECCMID 2013, Berlin Presentation Nr. 24 Controversies At this time the optimal metrics to benchmark antimicrobial use are still controversial: *To measure unit of antimicrobials consumed, one can use 'Days Of Therapy' (DOT) or Defined Daily Dose (DDD). The former is more commonly used in the US, the latter is more commonly used in Europe. *Data source for antimicrobial use: Where available, the electronic medication administration record (eMAR) is the most accurate correlate for doses given, but it may be difficult to analyze, because of hold orders and patient refusal, as opposed to administrative or pharmacy billing data, which may be easier to obtain. *The question of \\"appropriateness of use\\" is probably the most controversial. Appropriate use depends on the local antimicrobial resistance profile and therefore has different regional answers. Merely the \\"amount\\" of antibiotics used is no straightforward metric for appropriateness. *In regard to the most effective AMS intervention, the answer will depend on the size of the institution and the resources available: The system of \\"prior approval\\" of antimicrobials by infectious disease / pharamcology consultants has been used first historically. It is very time- and labor-intensive, and prescribers do not like its restrictive character. Increasingly, \\"post-prescription review\\" is used. *It can be difficult to decide if a clinical syndrome or a particular drug should be targeted for interventions and education. How to best modify prescriber behavior has been the subject of controversy and research. At issue is how feedback is presented to prescribers, individually, in aggregate, with or without peer comparisons, and whether to reward or punish. As long as the best quality metrics for an AMS program are unknown, a combination of antimicrobial consumption, antimicrobial resistance, and antimicrobial and drug resistant organism related mortality are used. *Although education consistently shows improvement in participants' knowledge and attitudes, the results do not always translate to better AMS practice.

(Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon nervosus.) It is a narrow-leaved, tropical paperbark with yellow-green and red-flowering forms. As with some other melaleucas, this species has many uses to Indigenous Australians. Description Melaleuca nervosa grows to tall, has erect branches and papery-fibrous bark which may be grey, cream, brown or white. There is variation in the leaf size and shape depending on the subspecies but they are generally long, wide, leathery, covered with fine or curly, silky hairs when young and have 3‚Äì7 longitudinal veins. The flowers are arranged in 6 to 20 groups of three in long spikes about long and diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and in this species there are 3‚Äì7 stamens per bundle. The flowers are white, creamy-green, cream, yellow-green or occasionally red. Flowers appear from April to September and are followed by fruit which are woody, cup-shaped capsules about long and wide. Collinsville, Queensland Taxonomy and naming Fibrebark was first formally described in 1848 by John Lindley and given the name Callistemon nervosum. The description was published in Thomas L. Mitchell's Journal of an expedition to the interior of tropical Australia. (Callistemon nervosum is an orthographic variant of the correct spelling Callistemon nervosus.) The type specimen was collected by Thomas Mitchell \\"at Mitchell's Camp of 16th July, 1846, which is quite close to Mantua Downs on the Claude and Nogoa Rivers, south of Springsure, north Queensland.\\" He described it as \\"a magnificent new crimson Callistemon, with its young flowers and leaves wrapped in wool\\". In 1944, Edwin Cheel changed the name to Melaleuca nervosa, the change published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (nervosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"sinewy\\", referring to the distinctive leaf veins of this species. Callistemon nervosus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca nervosa by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca is widespread in Queensland north of about Bundaberg, in the Northern Territory and the northern Kimberley in Western Australia. It occurs in a wide range of habitats including alluvium, sandy soils, along watercourses, in damp depressions and red sand dunes. Conservation Melaleuca nervosa is classified \\"not threatened\\" (in Western Australia) by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. UsesHorticulture= Fibrebark is readily propagated from seed. The red form is grown at Atherton and is the more useful ornamental. It should tolerate a wide range of soils and conditions. =Traditional uses= The bark of M. nervosa is used to make coolamons for carrying food and other items and cutting into the trunk provided fresh water. The leaves were used as a decongestant and oils extracted from the leaves had uses similar to those for tea tree oil.

This brought significant debate to the issue of religious conversion in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the turn of the century. Since she was taken to a monastery and baptized, Omanoviƒá has remained a symbol of Christian proselytism attempts on Bosnian Muslims. The case resulted in the development of the first Bosnian Muslim political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Story In the spring of 1899, Fata's father Osman Omanoviƒá's arranged for his 16-year-old daughter to marry an old friend of his. Omanoviƒá dreaded her fate and sought advice from her Catholic neighbors who persuaded her to escape to Dalmatia and renounce her religion. On the night of 2‚Äì3 May 1899, Fata met up with a Catholic guide who led her on the 32-kilometer journey to Dalmatia. In the coming days, the Omanoviƒá family learned that Fata had been taken to a monastery, baptized and accepted into the Catholic Church. On 5 May 1899, several leading Muslims of Mostar organized a protest meeting due to the kidnapping of young Fata Omanoviƒá by Catholic missionaries who took her to a monastery and baptized her. The Muslims formed a committee headed by the Mostar Mufti Ali Fehmi D≈æabiƒá. They called on the ruling Austro-Hungarian Empire to return Omanoviƒá and put an end to religious conversions. The Omanoviƒá case also resulted in the emergence of the first Bosnian Muslim political party, led by Ali-beg Firdus (1862‚Äì1910). According to Belgrade daily \\"Vreme\\", by 1940 Fata lived in Ljubljana as Darinka Prijatelj.(Serbian) Vreme, 17. aug. 1940, p. 7. digitalna.nb.rs Retr. 17. aug. 2019 She died there in 1967.(Slovenian) HMSejko: julij 2013 - BOSANCI NA SLOVENSKEM V 20.

It was the winner in the best album category in the 2016 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Singles The title track was issued as a single on 8 December 2014. \\"Flutter\\", another track from the album, was released as a single on 16 February 2015. A third single, \\"Died For Love\\", was released on 8 June 2015. Reception Mount the Air received a five-starred review in The Daily Telegraph. Reviewer Helen Brown described the album as \\"a slow, swirling affair that mixes original material with traditional tales. Underpinned by McNally‚Äôs cool, fluid piano it‚Äôs simultaneously ancient and fresh.\\" Joe Breen, writing in The Irish Times, also gave the album five stars, describing the Unthanks' Mount The Air as \\"their most ambitious work\\" and saying that it \\"places them in the same league as the likes of The Gloaming and the Punch Brothers\\". In a four-starred review for the Financial Times, David Honigmann said: \\"Once a bleak Northumbrian chamber folk outfit, the Unthanks have reinvented themselves on a symphonic scale, as witness the 10-minute title track, ushered in on harps and with an orchestration that recalls Gil Evans‚Äôs work for Miles Davis.\\" Robin Denselow, in a four-starred review for The Guardian, said: \\"This is a return to the gentle melancholia of Last, and while there are fine vocals from the Unthank sisters, the dominant figure is Rachel‚Äôs husband, Adrian McNally, who plays keyboards and percussion, and produced and wrote much of the music... It‚Äôs a lush, often exquisite set\\". Alexis Petridis, also writing in The Guardian, said it was \\"ambitious and rooted in folk traditions, without being hard work for the listener\\". Jason Noble, in a five-starred review for Culturefly, was impressed by the \\"phenomenal display of collaborative musicianship, with 16 members contributing to the record\\". Duncan Haskell, reviewing the album for Songwriting magazine, described it as \\"a majestic tour de force of classical beauty\\". Mike Davies, for Folking.com, hailed it as \\"a masterpiece\\". The Hartlepool Mail said it was The Unthanks' \\"most rewarding record to date\\". Teddy Jamieson, writing in the Sunday Herald, said: \\"The Unthanks return with an album that takes the folk tradition the sisters grew up on and sails it into wilder waters... Folk's storytelling tradition is still very much at the heart of this album. But what thrills here is the sense of scale at play in the music, the unrushed, easeful way the musicians stretch into songs, let them linger without ever overstaying their welcome. That and the earthy humanity of the sisters' voices.\\" In a four-starred review, Chris White, for MusicOMH, said that Mount the Air \\"continues The Unthanks‚Äô journey away from the traditional north-east folk of their earlier albums towards a style that's uniquely their own. It's hard to think of another group anywhere who are creating music quite like this; still grounded in the sounds and spirit of their native region yet compositionally on a different planet to the pub back room strums and ceilidh jigs knocked out by most of their contemporaries.\\" Also giving the album four stars, Thomas Ingham, writing for The Skinny, praised \\"the swelling and soaring arrangements of Adrian McNally, who manages to merge folk with the unease and medieval European gloom of recent records like Last Ex and the infamous In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\". Michael Ainscoe, for Louder Than War, described the album as \\"a textured soundscape of splendour and sensitive intensity\\". James Christopher Monger, in a four- starred review for AllMusic, described this Unthanks album as \\"a far more ambitious outing\\" than its predecessors. Simon Holland, for Folk Radio UK, said: \\"With two tracks at over 10 minutes, this was never going to be a short album, but... [it] does what great albums do, takes you on a journey, offers surprises, but gives you rewards on route, satisfying head and heart, with some moments of pure emotional static charge that make the hairs on the neck stand proud.\\" Describing the album as \\"a floating, swirling, blend of folk, indie-rock, and jazz\\", Russ Coffey, in a four-starred review for The Arts Desk, said: \\"Adrian McNally's piano motifs... bring a Wyatt-like warmth. Similarly, Tom Arthur's free-form trumpet lines add a lovely sense of yearning... Mount The Air is, above all, Adrian McNally‚Äôs album and shines brightest where his arrangements are at their most ambitious. The title track is masterful: 10 minutes of a grieving Dorset folk song set against Arthur's laconic jazz horn licks\\". Aaron Lavery, reviewing the album for Drowned in Sound, said: \\"The Unthanks have never been gentle background music as some might expect, as they‚Äôre always drawn to the darker stories that they can dig up. On Mount The Air, those stories are matched by some sumptuous, confident music, and they sound all the better for it.\\" However, The Observer's Neil Spencer bucked the trend, giving the album three stars, and criticising the \\"ambitious but lumbering orchestration... Two instrumentals eschew the group‚Äôs strength; more voices please\\". And Jim Wirth, for UNCUT, thought it \\"stylish, and extremely skillful, but a bit too much arr and not enough trad\\". Norman Miller, for Bearded magazine, said: \\"Less kow-towing to the glum side of a band of self-confessed 'miserable buggers' would have been good. As it is, we're left with one masterpiece track, a few good 'uns ‚Äì and a few too many clunkers\\".

Biography Lochore was the son of a Methodist minister and a teacher of the deaf. He studied English, French, Latin, philosophy and psychology at Auckland University College and also taught at a college in Wellington. From his adolescence, Lochore admired the German language and culture.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand: Fleeing Nazi Persecution, p.13. In 1930, Lochore moved to Germany where he became a university student. He studied at the Institute for Foreigners in Berlin and later pursued a PhD in Romance languages and literature at the University of Bonn. During his time in Germany, Lochore witnessed the rise of the Nazi Party.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp. 13, 19‚Äì21. During the Interwar period, he sought to promote friendly relations between New Zealand and Germany. He attempted to promote a trade agreement between the two countries but this initiative failed due to vocal trade union opposition in New Zealand and a lack of public interest in trade with Germany.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp.40‚Äì42. In 1938, Lochore defended a controversial visit to New Zealand by Felix von Luckner, a German commercial raider who had targeted Allied shipping in the South Pacific during World War One.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp.83‚Äì84. During World War Two, Lochore worked as the director for language services at the Department of Internal Affairs and was given the job of screening immigrants to New Zealand including Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp.118, 196‚Äì197. According to Freya Klier, Lochore's anti-Communism stemmed from an experience of being beaten up by a group of German Communists in 1930.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp.13‚Äì14. Owing to his connections to the first National Party Prime Minister Sidney Holland, Lochore worked at various diplomatic postings in Asia including Malaya and Indonesia. In 1950, he published a book called From Europe to New Zealand, which became a guide for helping the Government to screen non-British migrants.Freya Klier, Promised New Zealand, pp.227. While Lochore favoured importing Scandinavian and Dutch immigrants to supplement British and Irish immigrants, he discouraged Italian, Greek, Yugoslavian, Jewish, and Asian immigration to New Zealand. He was also opposed to settlement by Eurasians from the former Netherlands East Indies (modern-day Indonesia).Hank Schouten, Tasman's Legacy: The New Zealand-Dutch Connection, pp.67‚Äì69. In 1959, Lochore was appointed as the first secretary to Charles Bennett, the New Zealand high commissioner to Malaya and one of the first MƒÅori officials at the New Zealand Department of External Affairs.R.A. Lochore, \\"Culture-Historical Aspects of the Malayo-Polynesian Settlement in Ancient South-East Asia\\", Hocken Lecture 1973 (Dunedin, New Zealand: Hocken Library, University of Otago, 1974), p.3. Between 1964 and 1966, Lochore also served as the New Zealand minister to Indonesia. During his time in Indonesia, he witnessed the 30 September coup attempt and the rise of Suharto's New Order.Marie Gray, TƒÅmu: A New Zealand Family in Java, pp.132, 169‚Äì171.

He was an innovator in the fields of steam-powered printing presses, and lithography for book illustration. Life Bensley, the son of a printer in The Strand, had printing premises at Bolt Court, off Fleet Street in London, and William Bulmer was considered his only rival in fine printing. In a preface Bensley complains of a fire which had destroyed his premises, with much of his stock; he was burned out on two separate occasions, in 1807 and 1819. Works from the press included Thomas Macklin's folio Bible in seven volumes (1800), an edition of David Hume's History of England, and an octavo Shakespeare. A trustee of Providence Chapel, in Gray's Inn Lane, Bensley supported the ministry of William Huntington; and helped to raise the monument by Sir Richard Westmacott on the death of Huntington in 1813. He printed The Posthumous Letters of William Huntington (1822), which he also edited in part. Development of the press Friedrich Koenig came to London from Saxony in 1806, with a design for the powered \\"Suhl press\\". Bensley took up the innovation, and formed a consortium with Richard Taylor and George Woodfall to monopolise it. Working with Andreas Friedrich Bauer, Koenig took out a patent in 1810, and built a working machine for Bensley in 1811. Over the next few years, development work produced a steam- driven press adapted to printing newspapers, rather than books as initially, and it was used for The Times of London. The working relationship of Bensley and Koenig broke down by 1817, however, as Bensley enforced his shareholding rights.

It was written in 1887 by George Kitchin and revised in 1916 by Michael R. Newbolt.  History  Kitchin wrote \\"Lift High the Cross\\" in 1887, while he was the Church of England Dean of Winchester, for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. It has been suggested that the hymn was inspired by the story of Constantine the Great's conversion to Christianity after seeing a cross with \\"In hoc signo vinces\\" on it. It was intended as a festival hymn and was first performed in Winchester Cathedral. In 1916, Newbolt revised the hymn so that it was in twelve couplets and it was printed in the 1916 Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern. In that same revision, \\"Lift High the Cross\\" was set to the tune of \\"Crucifer\\" by Sydney Nicholson. The hymn is often sung during Lent or Holy Week but is also used as a processional hymn or recessional hymn before or after a church service. \\"Lift High the Cross\\" was first published in the United States in 1974 by Donald Hustad in Hymns for the Living Church and since then has appeared in a number of different hymnals outside England. In 1978 it appeared in the Lutheran Book of Worship, the hymnal for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 1982 it appeared in Lutheran Worship, the hymnal for the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. In 1989 the hymn was included in The United Methodist Hymnal, but with a replacement first verse as the original was considered to be too militaristic.  Critical analysis  Lift High the Cross church hymn The lyrics of \\"Lift High the Cross\\" have been subject to discussion. Stanley L. Osbourne wrote that the hymn's \\"images are biblical, its moods expectant, its promises courageous, and its demands costly\\" while stating that the cross in the hymn is a symbol of the love of Jesus. However, there has been a view from Christian scholars that the hymn is an endorsement of the Gospel of John's description of the Passion (remembered on Good Friday) and focuses on the cross as a source of agony rather than as a throne of Jesus. Usage of the hymn on Easter Sunday is often contextualized as the cross being a sign of resurrection rather than of death and shame.

Knapp (21 November 1870 - 14 March 1953) was an American Christian missionary and teacher who served in the Ottoman Empire. During her time as a missionary, Knapp was a witness to the Armenian Genocide. During the Armenian Genocide, Knapp was stationed in Van and eventually described the events in the region in two published books describing her experiences. The first book, The Mission at Van in Turkey in War Time, describes in detail the massacres of Armenians by Turkish soldiers during the Van Resistance. Her second book, The Tragedy of Bitlis, relates the narratives of two nurses who witnessed massacres of Armenians in Bitlis. Her recounts of Bitlis are one of the few written accounts of massacres in that area. Early life Grace Highley Knapp was born on 21 November 1870 to missionary parents in Bitlis, Ottoman Empire. Her father, Reverend George Cushing Knapp, was a dedicated missionary and her mother, Alzina Churchill Knapp, was a teacher. In April 1883, at the age of twelve, Knapp moved to the United States to receive an education in Massachusetts, Vermont and Illinois. In 1889, she began studying at the Mount Holyoke College and graduated in 1893. She then returned to the Ottoman Empire in October of that year where she taught at the Mount Holyoke Seminary of Kurdistan, located in Bitlis. She later taught at Erzurum and Van, where she was assigned to teach at different points in time. Witness of the Armenian GenocideBackground= In the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì13, the Ottoman Empire had lost its Balkan possessions to Christian uprisings, intensifying fears in the Turkish homeland that the Empire's increasingly restive Armenian Christian minority--with the assistance or encouragement of Western governments--might also attempt to establish an independent state, resulting in the breakup of Turkey itself. As a result of the wars, at least half a million Muslim Ottomans from the former Balkan possessions of the Empire sought refuge in Turkey, sparking a desire for revenge among many Turks. Distrust and suspicion of Armenians reached a peak following the outbreak of World War I, when a successful advance of Russian troops across the Turkish border into the heavily Armenian-populated vilayet of Van in early 1915 was blamed on Armenian disloyalty, leading the Turkish government to adopt a set of extreme measures which would culminate in the Armenian genocide. =Massacres in Van= Grace Knapp relates in her memoirs The mission at Van in Turkey in war time that she was in Van at the outbreak of World War I. She notes that during mobilization of the Ottoman army in the fall of 1914, many Armenians were ransacked and their wealth stolen. Armenian soldiers conscripted in the Ottoman army were subjugated to maltreatment and were forced to do manual labor under harsh conditions. Prior to the conscription, the arms of the Armenians were confiscated and the population was left in a vulnerable state at a time of war. Knapp states that despite the confiscations of the weapons, the Armenians held their restraint and forbade any further escalation of tensions. They prevented fights from occurring and forbade Armenian villagers from conducting any sort of insurrection. Like Grace Knapp, missionary Clarence Ussher was in Van during the Armenian Genocide. In 1917 Ussher published a memoir about his experiences entitled An American Physician in Turkey: A Narrative of Adventures in Peace and War in which he wrote that 55,000 Armenians were killed in Van alone. It is considered one of the most detailed eyewitness accounts of the events. In February 1915, missionary Clarence Ussher, who was stationed in the American hospital in Van, relates in his memoir An American Physician in Turkey: A Narrative of Adventures in Peace and War, that the \\"strong and liberal-minded\\" governor or vali of the province was replaced with Cevdet Bey, brother-in-law of the Turkish Commander-in- Chief, Enver Pasha. The new vali was unable to travel to Van until late March, when he arrived \\"accompanied by several thousand soldiers and Kurdish and Circassian irregulars\\".Bloxham 2005, Chapter 2. Knapp's memoir recounts the arrival of Cevdet Bey in similar detail to that of Ussher's. Just as Ussher notes in his own memoirs, Knapp writes that one of Cevdet's first acts was to demand of the Van Armenians that they supply 3,000 able-bodied men (Ussher states 4,000) for work battalions, but the Armenian leadership, fearful of Cevdet's intentions, offered 400 men (Ussher states 500) and payment of the standard exemption fee for the rest, which Cevdet rejected. On 16 April, Cevdet had a community leader in the town of Shadakh arrested, but the townspeople, acting on a rumour of his impending murder, surrounded the police station demanding his release. Ussher relates in his memoir that Cevdet then invited a small group of Armenian leaders to visit Shadakh on a peace mission, but had them assassinated en route. After the murder, Knapp relates that the Armenians urged Ussher to pacify the governor. Hence, Ussher himself, who had known Cevdet Bey since childhood, paid a visit to the vali in the hope of defusing tensions. Ussher recounts his meeting with Cevdet as follows: Ussher later suggests that this exchange was an intentional deception, as the regiment in question did not attack Shadakh but was instead diverted to a valley where they \\"destroyed six villages containing nothing but old men, women and children\\"; other sources however suggest that the diversion was simply due to the indiscipline of the unit.Bloxham 2005, Chapter 2, \\"Ethnic Agitation and 'Ethnic Reprisal' in the Eastern Border Regions\\". Knapp describes the aftermath of the Ussher's account in similar detail. After this, Cevdet again demanded that 4,000 Armenian men \\"give themselves up to the military\\", releasing a couple of Armenian leaders as a goodwill gesture, but the Armenians, by now convinced of Cevdet's hostile intentions, delayed giving a reply. Meanwhile, Ussher and the Italian Consular Agent, Signor Sbordini, continued negotiating with Cevdet, attempting to persuade him that his actions were inflaming rather than calming the situation, but Cevdet had by this time chosen another course. On 19 April, he had a secret order issued to his forces in the vilayet: Cevdet Bey, Knapp likewise wrote, was to \\"first punish Shadakh\\" and was to then punish those who resisted by killing of \\"every man, woman and child of the Christians.\\" What then followed was what contemporary historians call Cevdet Bey's \\"reign of terror\\" in which 55,000 Armenians estimated were to be killed. =Van resistance= Armenians digging trenches Grace Knapp states that the Armenians were not planning a \\"rebellion\\" as the governor claims, but trying to find a peaceful way to resolve the conflict. Other eyewitnesses, such as Elizabeth Ussher, the wife of Clarence Ussher, similarly wrote that \\"although the Vali calls it a rebellion, it is really an effort to protect the lives and the homes of the Armenians.\\" Nevertheless, the Armenians began to dig trenches, and prepared to defend themselves. Ussher states that the Armenians were deprived of many of its able-bodied men due to the mobilization, and were limited in ammunition and weapons due to the confiscations. Knapp then recounts that Cevdet Bey demanded that fifty Turkish soldiers be stationed in the American missionary compound in Van, but this was rejected by the Armenians on the grounds that it would compromise their defensive positions. By this time, the war already started, and the guards would never be sent. City of Van and its neighborhoods. The \\"Garden City\\" or Aikesdan in Armenian was the Armenian quarter which was besieged by Turkish troops during the siege. According to Knapp, the attack on Van was sparked when a group of Turkish soldiers attempted to seize an Armenian girl. When two Armenian men reproached the Turks, the Turkish soldiers immediately opened fire and killed the Armenian men. A scuffle then broke out which quickly developed into \\"a general fusillade\\" followed by an artillery barrage by the Turks in the morning of 20 April. This was followed by a charge of Turkish infantry accompanied by a \\"Turkish mob\\" which was readily repulsed with small arms fire. Ussher then reports Cevdet's command attacked Armenian villages throughout the vilayet. At Arjish, the second largest town, the commander assembled the town's leaders and its 2,500 men and had them marched to a nearby river where they were slain \\"in groups of fifty\\", after which \\"the women and children and property were divided among the Turks\\". Knapp likewise writes that a man from the village of Arjish told her that on 19 April, the Armenians were gathered and then \\"mowed down\\" by Cevdet's soldiers. The village of Shadakh, previously mentioned, proved \\"unconquerable\\", and another, Moks, was effectively protected by a Kurdish chief, but while some other villages were able to mount a degree of resistance, most had no means of doing so. Ussher recounts that the Turkish forces burned the houses of the Armenian districts that had been left outside the Armenian defensive perimeter, and settled in for a siege. Knapp similarly writes that \\"houses were seen burning in every direction.\\" It was after this point of the conflict that an estimated 55,000 Armenians were to be killed. The Armenians were then confined inside a square mile district known as the \\"Garden City\\" or Aikesdan in Armenian. This district was then subjugated to a bombardment by the Turkish forces. In order to defend themselves, the Armenians were making their own weapons and ammunition, and were able to manufacture about 2000 rounds of small-arms ammunition a day, from scrap metal and Turkish shrapnel, for the duration of the siege. According to Ussher, the city was left by the time of the siege with only 300 men armed with modern rifles, plus another 1,000 armed with pistols and \\"antique weapons\\"; this force would however prove sufficient to keep Cevdet's much larger and better equipped force at bay for several weeks. Nevertheless, the Armenians continued to make an effort to resort to peaceful means. They sent formal declarations to the Turkish soldiers saying that they did not want to fight their \\"Turkish neighbors\\". The Armenians also held disciplinary rules to restrain themselves from unlawful conduct and to engage in proper ethics during the siege. Knapp writes: Knapp writes that the Armenians did not attempt to make an offensive. She wrote that the Armenians were \\"fighting for their homes, their very lives\\". As previously mentioned, this was also stated by Elizabeth Ussher. Therefore, Knapp asserted that she was more sympathetic towards the Armenians, but had to remain neutral throughout the conflict. The Armenians likewise did not want to drag the Americans into the conflict. They refused to have their wounded soldiers be treated by American physicians at the compound. Instead, they were treated by Ussher at a hospital belonging to the Armenians. On 23 April, Knapp relates that Cevdet Bey sent Ussher a letter threatening to bombard the American compound if they allowed Armenians located nearby to enter the compound. The Americans insisted that they were to remain neutral. A photograph taken in 1913 of the Varagavank monastery in Van. In May 1915 the Turkish army attacked, burned, and destroyed much of the monastery. Knapp recounted: \\"On May 8th we saw [the village of Shushantz] in flames and Varak Monastery near by with its priceless ancient manuscripts also went up in smoke.\\" Knapp writes that Cevdet Bey's soldiers and their Kurdish allies were committing massacres in the countryside. She writes in detail: The refugees of these massacres came to the American compound for help, but Ussher had them treated at another hospital instead. As the siege continued, the Armenians held their positions well after two weeks of fighting. Knapp notes that despite the ongoing bombardment, the Armenians had succeeded in creating a government, though it was relatively ineffectual. On 8 May, the Varagavank Armenian monastery was set on fire and \\"priceless ancient manuscripts also went up in smoke.\\" The house Knapp was staying in was bombarded heavily by artillery. Although she managed to survive, her bedroom was destroyed. On 14 May, after almost a month of siege, Turkish forces withdrew due to the advance of Russian forces, who relieved the city a few days later. Knapp states that the city was \\"awake, singing, and rejoicing all nights.\\" Russian troops had occupied the city on 19 May, and the siege was officially over. With the lifting of the siege, the Armenians were to enjoy a brief ten-week period of self-governance with Aram Manukian as governor. During this time, relief was provided by the missionaries for the refugees of the conflict. But this period was also marked by the spread of disease, which claimed the lives of several missionaries including Ussher's wife, Elizabeth. Thereafter, advancing Turkish forces brought the city under threat once again. The Russian troops ordered a retreat and thousands of Armenians fled the city rather than fall once more into Turkish hands, fleeing across the border to the relative safety of the Russian Caucasus. Knapp, along with other American missionaries, were evacuated through caravans provided by the Red Cross. =Massacres in Bitlis= The Armenian monastery of Bitlis in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide with severed heads and corpses in the foreground. Although Knapp was not in Bitlis during the time of the Armenian Genocide, she published narratives from two nurses who were present at the time. In the preface of her book, Knapp states that the accounts were word for word narratives from nurses Grisell Mclaren and Myrtle Shane. She also says that Bitlis was an important place for her since it was her birthplace and her family's residence for several generations. Miss Mclaren's story begins with the description of the situation in Van where she was a nurse in a hospital. During the siege, Mclaren was told at the request of Cevdet Bey to remain in the hospital during the siege. Meanwhile, she wrote, \\"We pictured our Armenian friends as being driven from their homes and cruelly massacred.\\" Mclaren did not remain in Van long and was relocated to Bitlis by boat across Lake Van. On their way to Bitlis, Mclaren and the others stopped at the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross located on an island for a meal. However, upon arrival, the priests said that Turkish soldiers visited the monastery a couple of days before and murdered several priests and orphans. The soldiers then ransacked the church, for which Mclaren writes: Mclaren and her company arrived in the village of Tatvan located on the western shore of Lake Van. While in Tatvan, she describes a scene in which about fifty survivors of a massacre appeared before them. The survivors, who were mainly women, told Mclaren that their children had been killed and that their bodies were thrown into Lake Van. They also related how their daughters were kidnapped by local Kurds. When the women decided to complain to the local government of Bitlis, Mclaren remarked that they were not aware that \\"the affair had been ordered by the government.\\" Mclaren remained in the village as local Kurds continued to engage in massacre throughout the countryside. This was followed by the mass arrests of Armenian men aged ten years and above on June 22. On June 25, the ongoing massacres were further assisted by Cevdet Bey who arrived in Bitlis from Van accompanied with 8,000 reinforcement troops known as \\"human butchers.\\" Those arrested were then escorted out of the city and killed using axes and shovels. Mclaren related that those who resisted arrest were killed and their houses were burned. According to historian Raymond K√©vorkian, it took two weeks for the Armenian male population of Bitlis to be eliminated. Soon after the arrests, the deportation of women and children began on 29 June. Mclaren and other American colleagues tried to save young girls under their care from deportation by appealing to the Vali. The Vali then refused and stated that \\"an order had come from Constantinople that not an Armenian should remain in Bitlis.\\" Meanwhile, as Mclaren relates, \\"the police seemed to have gone mad in their thirst for Armenian blood.\\" She notes that the gendarmes were now killing the remaining women and children of Bitlis. She describes in detail: After occupying Van, the Russian army approached Bitlis in mid July. With the arrival of the Russian army, the Muslim inhabitants of Bitlis fled, effectively ending the massacres. However, by July 15 and prior to the arrival of the Russian army, the elimination of the Armenian population of Bitlis was already \\"virtually complete\\". After a short stay, the Russian army retreated on July 24 and Turkish forces reestablished their presence in Bitlis. Mclaren and Shane remained in Bitlis until 30 November 1915, when they were escorted out of Bitlis. Along the way, they both witnessed mutilated bodies and corpses as a result of other massacres and encountered many villages destroyed by fire. In October 1917, Grisell Mclaren and Myrtle Shane wrote about their experiences in Bitlis during the war. In 1919, the accounts were then published in Knapp's The Tragedy of Bitlis. Later life When Grace Knapp returned to the United States, she relocated to New York City where she began to work as a staff writer for the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief (ACASR; now known as the Near East Foundation) from 1918 to 1923. The ACASR was a relief organization in charge of assisting the victims and survivors of the Armenian and Assyrian Genocide. After relocating to Boston, Massachusetts, Knapp continued working as an editor for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions from 1923 to 1940. She had published her experiences while working in the Ottoman Empire in several books entitled \\"The mission at Van in Turkey in war time\\" (1916) and \\"The Tragedy of Bitlis\\" (1917), the latter being a collection of eyewitness accounts as noted above. Knapp has donated her personal photographs, letters, and documents related to her experiences in Bitlis, Erzerum, and Van to the Mount Holyoke College Archives & Special Collections. In addition to having published eyewitness accounts, she has also written a pamphlet of poems. On 14 March 1953, Grace Knapp died in Auburndale, Massachusetts at the age of 82.

The changes took effect on October 20, 2012, when Jack City was launched, with some of Chase's programs carried onto its roster. The full broadcast was initiated on November 11, 2012. On June 28, 2013, the channel's airing hours were reduced to 18 hours a day on free TV, in compliance with the National Telecommunications Commission's guidelines. However, it still continues to air 24 hours a day as a cable channel. On September 1, 2014, Jack City ended its run on free TV, due to the preparations being made by BEAM 31 for the incoming transition to ISDB-T digital television, though it continues to be broadcast as a separate cable channel. This move resulted in a change of its channel assignment for SkyCable and Destiny Cable (Digital) subscribers. =2015‚Äì2017: CT= On March 22, 2015, Jack City was replaced by CT, thus becoming independent from its parent network. Upon launch, the channel broadened its programming focus by adding talk shows, sitcoms and men's lifestyle programs to its roster. =Dispute with Sky Cable and Digital test broadcast= On April 10, 2017, Sky Cable & Destiny Cable was dropped CT along with Basketball TV, Jack TV, Solar Sports & NBA Premium TV allegedly due to Sky Cable's unpaid carriage fees. On December 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm, CT officially signed off the air due to low viewership and programming redundancies.

Operating primarily in Burma, he helped form the Burma Independence Army and was an advocate for Burmese independence, described as a \\"Japanese Lawrence of Arabia\\". The Burmese refererred to him by the nom de guerre Bo Mogyo, meaning \\"Thunderbolt Commander\\". However, his mission ultimately laid the groundwork for the Japanese occupation of Burma. Despite his commitment to Burmese Independence, Suzuki was opposed to the independence of Korea. Training Suzuki was trained at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and graduated as an infantry officer in 1918. He subsequently attended the General Staff College and in 1929 began clandestine operations in the Philippines. His main focus, in both his studies and early career, was Anglo-American affairs. Suzuki's official military position was the Head of the General Staff Headquarters' Shipping Section. However, he was trained at the Rikugun Nakano Gakk≈ç and was secretly an intelligence agent charged with disrupting Allied activities in Asia by shutting down supply lines to China through the Burma Road. Operations In the 1930s, Suzuki, operating out of Bangkok, recruited a number of Burmese dissidents and radicals. His network of associates would later become the nucleus of the underground spy organisation. He was closely connected with the Thakins, a nationalist group of students and labourers. In 1940, he secretly entered Rangoon with assistance from his network of contacts, posing as a reporter named Minami Masuyo. Suzuki worked on Hainan Island for six months in 1941, training the Thirty Comrades in preparation for the Japanese invasion of Burma. At one point in their training he was noted for boasting about how he had killed women and children in Siberia.Thant Myint-U. The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma. London: Faber and Faber Limited. 2008. p.229 In 1941, Japanese Imperial general Headquarters authorised Suzuki to create a Burmese military force under Japanese authority. He drew together the Thirty Comrades, a group of independence fighters which included Aung San, Ne Win and Bo Let Ya. Suzuki's work eventually led to the creation of the Burmese Independence Army. However, in 1942 a Japanese Army commander, Lieutenant-General Shijiro Iida, became concerned over Suzuki's pro-independence stance and authority over the Burmese Independence Army. He orchestrated Suzuki's recall to Japan, and the Burmese Independence Army was subsequently reorganised and placed under the direction of Aung San (himself under the control of the Japanese). Suzuki returned to Tokyo, and for the rest of the war fulfilled the duties of his official role as Head of Shipping by overseeing transport and logistics. Suzuki had a flair for the dramatic. His chosen Burmese name, Bo Mogyo, was a references to the thunderbolt which Burmese folk tradition held would destroy the \\"umbrella\\" (a symbol of British colonial rule). He also allowed rumours to develop connecting him to Myingun Min, a prince of the exiled Burmese royal family, and engaged in cultish blood-drinking oaths with his companions. During the Japanese occupation of Burma Suzuki cultivated rumors that he was a long-lost descendant of Prince Myingun, an older half-brother of the last Burmese king who had escaped to British-controlled Burma following a failed coup attempt against his father, who many Burmese people saw as the legitimate heir to the last Burmese kingdom.Thant Myint-U. The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma. London: Faber and Faber Limited. 2008. p.219 After his death in 1967, Suzuki was posthumously honoured by the Burmese leader Ne Win.

The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Northern Potter Junior Senior High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse are available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. ;Health eTools program: The School participated in Highmark Foundation's Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, Northern Potter School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Northern Potter Children's School received $7,700 which was used to fund Winter Sports Program. The Junior Senior High School also received a $7,850 grant for its Winter Sports Program.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Tuition Students who live in the Northern Potter School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Northern Potter School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates at the High School were $13,429.96. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Northern Potter School District did not apply to participate in any of the three years the grant ran. It was one of just fifty-four school districts that did not receive state funding for computers and smart boards. In Potter County the highest award was given to Coudersport Area School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide, by Governor Rendell, due to a multibillion-dollar state financial crisis. Project 720 Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High school's applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Northern Potter School District was not one of the 161 PA public school districts to apply.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.PA Office of the Budget, 2011-12 Budget General Fund - State Appropriations, June 28, 2011 Extracurriculars The Northern Potter School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, sports program. Eligibility to participate is determined by school board policy. Athletes may be failing 1 credit and still participate in sports. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. The District provides sports in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Life The son of Henry Sampson Woodfall, he was his father's partner in the printing business till December 1793, when the father retired. George Woodfall later moved to Angel Court, Snow Hill, where he carried on business till 1840, when his eldest son, Henry Dick Woodfall, fifth in a line of printers, became his partner. When Friedrich K√∂nig, inventor of the steam printing-press, was in London in 1806, Thomas Bensley brought his fellow-printers Woodfall and Richard Taylor into a consortium to develop a press. Woodfall, however, failed to see the potential. Woodfall was often chosen chairman at the meetings of the London master- printers. In 1812 he was elected a stock-keeper of the Stationers' Company; in 1825 member of the court of assistants, and master of the company in 1833‚Äì4. He was re-elected stock-keeper in 1836, and in 1841 he was elected master for the second time. In 1823 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1824 of the Royal Society of Literature. He served on the general committee of the Royal Literary Fund from 1820 to 1828, and, on his resignation, was elected to the council, an office which he filled till his death, with the exception of the period between March 1835 and March 1838, when he was treasurer to the corporation. He was a commissioner for the lieutenancy of the city of London. He died on 22 December 1844 at his house in Dean's Yard, Westminster. Identity of Junius and legacy An edition of the Letters of Junius, published in 1812, was by Woodfall; John Mason Good wrote the preliminary essay and notes. John Taylor went through the files of the Public Advertiser at Woodfall's request, looking for earlier works of Junius; from the search 140 letters were marked up, and of these 113 were printed as being \\"by the same writer under other signatures\\". Some were authentic; but most were identified by the personal opinion of Woodfall and Taylor. Woodfall left it on record, on his father's authority, that Junius wrote the Letters signed \\"Lucius\\", \\"Brutus\\", and \\"Atticus\\"; his father also said on the identity of Junius, to his personal knowledge, that Sir Philip Francis \\"did not write a line of Junius\\". Woodfall left in manuscript a detailed review of John Jaques's Junius and his Works (1843), also doubting that Francis wrote the letters. Many of Junius's letters in manuscript, which his father had preserved, passed to Woodfall, who printed the unpublished ones and added facsimiles of the handwriting. Woodfall left these papers to his son, Henry Dick Woodfall, from whom they passed, through Joseph Parkes, to the British Museum. Another edition by John Wade of \\"Junius\\" letters was published in 1850 by Henry Bohn.

Iran expressed for the first time its intention to send a human to space during the summit of Soviet and Iranian Presidents in 1990. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev reached an agreement in principle with erstwhile President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to make joint Soviet-Iranian crewed flights to Mir space station but agreement was never realized after dissolution of USSR. Iranian News Agency claimed on 21 November 2005, that the Iranians have a human space program along with plans for the development of a spacecraft and a space laboratory. Iran Aerospace Industries Organization (IAIO) head Reza Taghipour on 20 August 2008, revealed Iran intends to launch a human mission into space within a decade. This goal was described as the country's top priority for the next 10 years, in order to make Iran the leading space power of the region by 2021. In August 2010, President Ahmadinejad announced that Iran's first astronaut should be sent into space on board an Iranian spacecraft by no later than 2019 and expressed the wish to be this first astronaut after retirement from president status. Some details of the design were published by the institute in its \\"Astronaut\\" publication in February 2015. A mock up of the spaceship was displayed on 17 February 2015 during the ceremony of the national day of space of Iran. The head of the institute announced that the spaceship will be launched to space in about one year, which did not happen. The Iranian President and several of the ministers were present in the unveiling and the ceremony. If funded and developed, US Mercury and SU Vostok class Iranian small capsuled spacecraft would carry a single astronaut to a 175 km altitude and return it to Earth. The spacecraft was designated the code name \\"Class E Kavoshgar\\" project. The main components include the launcher adapter, spacecraft, and the launch abort system. A sub-orbital test flight with monkey was conducted in 2016. According to Iran's Space Administrator, this program was put on hold in 2017 indefinitely. According to unofficial Chinese internet sources, an Iranian participation in the future Chinese space station program has been under discussion. Currently Iran doesn't have a medium lift rocket similar to Long March 2F, GSLV Mk III and H-IIA. Therefore, developing of full scale spacecraft able to dock with any station is unlikely by Iran due to the lack of equipment.

At the beginning of the Ebla's tablets deciphering process in the 1970s, Giovanni Pettinato made claims about a connection. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connection with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely described as \\"exceptional and unsubstantiated claims\\" and \\"great amounts of disinformation that leaked to the public\\". In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible, and Ebla is now studied above all as a civilization in its own right. The tide turned after a bitter personal and scholarly conflict between the scientists involved, and an alleged interference by the Syrian authorities on political grounds. The controversy Pettinato, in a meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in St. Louis on October 29, 1976, said that he had identified the names of Sodom, Gomorrah, and Zoar/Bela in the Ebla tablets, locations which are known from of the Hebrew Bible.William H. Shea, \\"Two Palestinian Segments From the Eblaite Geographical Atlas\\" in The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman pp. 589-612, ed. Carol Meyers, Eisenbrauns, 1983, He repeated this claim in a speech in December and a survey article in 1977. Alfonso Archi fiercely contested these findings in 1979 and 1981. These back- and-forth interpretations of Eblaite tablets were based on tablets whose facsimiles had not been published for others to study, and some of Pettinato's findings changed. For example, Pettinato claimed to find references to Sodom and Gomorrah, but retracted his Zoar reading. The argument raged in the Biblical Archaeology Review and amongst other scholars at the time. =Geographic sites= As some of the Eblaite inscriptions were published as early as 1978,Giovanni Pettinato, \\"L'atlante geografico del vicino oriente attestato ad Ebla e ad Ab≈´ SalƒÅbikh\\", Orientalia 47 (1978:50-73). scholars attempted to translate some of them. When tablet TM 75.G.2231 was published, it was described as the \\"Eblaite Geographical Atlas\\" (EGA) because it contained 289 locations including place names, geographical constructs like forest, valley, and river, and travel directions, like circuit. The tablet was essentially a duplicate of a text found at Abu Salabikh in Iraq, and therefore assisted in the reconstruction of the fragmented one there. For example, in 1983, William H. Shea published a study of about 80 of these place names to try to identify the ones in Palestine. Of the sites studied from the EGA, many were classified by William Shea as \\"good mention\\", such as: Maakah (Abel Beth Maacah?), New Aphek, Ragaba, Damiyeh, Abila, Gibeon, Gibbethon, Janoah, Halhul, Admah, Sodom, Seir, and Aqabah. Both Admah and Sodom were given particular scrutiny due to the controversy surrounding the works of Pettinato concerning a different tablet. Questionable place names in the EGA included Abel-Shittim, Ashdod, Geshur, Lod, Yabneh, and Gilead, amongst many others. The same EGA, now called the \\"List of Geographic Names\\" by more recent researchers, has been interpreted quite differently as names of places in Mesopotamia and not Palestine. For example, the same city in the list, No. 172, is said to be Beirut in the Shea article, while at least one modern scholar believes it is Abudan, locating it in modern Iraq near Abu Duwari.The Struggle for Hegemony in 'Early Dynastic II' Sumer,\\" Douglas Frayne, The Canadian Society for Mesopotamian Studies, Vol 4, 2009, pp. 37-41, =Hebrew names and rituals= Many ancient Hebraic names that have not been found in other Near Eastern languages have been reported to occur in similar forms in Eblaite (Adamu, H'√†-wa, Jabal, Abarama, Bilhah, Ishma-el, Is√ªra-el, Esau, Mika-el, Saul, David). Also among Pettinato's claims, rituals like the release of a scape goat laden with impuritiesIda Zatelli, \\"The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Texts\\", Vetus Testamentum 48.2 (April 1998):254-263) in purification rites connected with a wedding and enthronement were immediately recognized as ancient Near Eastern parallels to Hebrew practice in the first millennium, recorded in Leviticus 16. Other claims included the election of local kings, claimed to be uniquely reminiscent of practices in early Israel.Moorey, 1991, p.150‚Äì152. However, Ebla was a hereditary monarchy, and contrary to many earlier claims, the present consensus is that \\"Ebla has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrha\\". Yahweh Among Pettinato's controversial claims, he suggested that there was a change in the theophoric names shown in many of the tablets from El to Yah, indicated in the example of the transition from Mika'il to Mikaya. This change is represented by the cuneiform sign NI (), which Pettinato read as ya, he regards this as evidence for an early use of the divine name Yah, however, Pettinato does not conclude that this is the same as the Israelite God Yahweh (YHWH). Jean Bott√©ro has suggested that this shift may instead indicate the Akkadian god Ea (Ia). On the other hand, both Archi (at first) and Anson Rainey, have suggested that the -ya is actually a diminutive ending used in shortened forms of personal names, while Hans-Peter M√ºller has argued that the cuneiform sign NI should be interpreted in this case as a short for NI-NI () and read as √≠-l√≠ which mean My God, a view that Archi has since adopted with a modification, his reading of NI being √≠l (god). No list of gods or offerings mentions a deity by the name of Ya, and the connection with Yahweh is largely rejected today by scholars. Creation myth Three tablets containing almost the same text have been found. According to Pettinato, they describe an Eblaite creation hymn, and they have been translated by him as : :Lord of heaven and earth: :the earth was not, you created it, :the light of day was not, you created it, :the morning light you had not [yet] made exist. These lines seem to have points in common both with known Sumerian creation stories and with the biblical account. Nevertheless, Archi objected that the original text is unclear to the point of being incomprehensible (texts from Ebla are difficult to read in general), leading him to conclude that \\"there is no Genesis creation story\\" in the documents. End of the controversy The supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible are now widely dismissed as unsubstantiated. The studies on Ebla focus on the civilization of the city. The controversy cooled after much scholarly conflict as well as what some described as interference by the Syrian authorities on political grounds.

Her specialty was inserting and ejecting things from her vagina onstage; when she performed at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, she was described in the program as \\"vaginiste\\", a performer using the vagina. She was often arrested. According to Bruce David, editor of SCREW in the 1970s, then editor of Hustler, she was at one point the best-known stripper in the United States. She is particularly associated with SCREW, for whom she was a sort of mascot. As Al Goldstein said, her act \\"was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, we made her our symbol.\\" She was the only female associated with SCREW over any period of time. Early years Born in Rock Island, Illinois, Divine was the tenth in a family of fourteen children. She described her father as a \\"hillbilly, banjo-playing lumberjack.\\" She was a straight-A student until she hit puberty. Religion was not a significant part of her upbringing, but when she reached her teens it started to dominate her every thought. Divine didn't drink, smoke, curse or gamble. She would help the elderly and those even poorer than her. She regularly prayed for the sick and the needy. She was a model Christian girl, but she dated boys, and had her heart broken. She became pregnant and had an abortion. At 21, bored with life in Rock Island, she departed for Philadelphia, where she became a postulant (novice) at the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart convent. After three months, unable to \\"understand the spiritual lessons they tried to teach me,\\" she left the convent, climbing out a window in the night, and went to the police, who assisted her in returning to Rock Island. Working as a stripper Unsuccessful in nursing school, she got a job as a waitress, but soon found out that she could make much more money as a stripper. She moved to Washington, D.C. and performed in burlesque clubs during the 1960s, under the name Pussy Bird. According to a 1975 interview, she left Illinois \\"armed only with a dress, a douche, and a diary.\\" Divine danced and prostituted herself in Washington and Baltimore during the 1960s, while keeping her apartment base in Washington. According to her diary, her clients included a senator, a governor, two ambassadors to the United Nations, two union leaders, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and, she claimed, the president of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson. > After I had been in Washington a couple of years, I met the President. I had > been screwing one of his aides, and this guy told me (about the President). > And then I screwed one of his relatives. So the President must have heard > about me from these people. One night (Johnson) came into the striptease > club (Fredericks) where I was with some other guys and he bought me a bottle > of champagne. He made a date with me, and we went to the Statler Hilton, and > then he took me home in a taxi to my apartment. The night I spent with the > President at the Statler Hilton might have blossomed into a more lasting > relationship if not for the Viet Nam war. He was a wonderful man who hated > the decision he had to make. Fortunately, the times I went to bed with > important people in Washington, D.C., it was strictly on a play-for-pay > basis, and no mistress-type emotional affairs. She referred many times to her liaison with Johnson. She also said that Vice- President Spiro Agnew was a fan. In the late 1960s, Divine also started to perform regularly in New York, usually staying at the Edison Hotel, appearing at various emporia of gynecomania such as the Roxy, the Psychedelic Burlesk Theater (\\"not a popular working spot because the men's room is located backstage and when the girls leave the stage at the end of their acts, guys are usually there waiting to ambush them‚ÄîI was attacked three times in one day there\\"), and the Forty-second Street Playhouse (\\"the last sign of life before a desolate stretch of parking lots leading toward the Hudson River\\"). By all accounts Divine's act was unremarkable; she wasn't a great dancer and she didn't have a particularly suggestive stage routine, but it was an era when the clubs were often being busted by cops on the lookout for anything resembling lewd behavior. Around 1970, by accident stumbling on a description of the famous flatulist Le P√©tomane, she decided that she could spice up her act. This led to her becoming a headliner across the country, as audiences were wowed by her performances, which included blowing out candles with air forced out of her vagina; shooting ping-pong balls, Jergens lotion, and other items from her vagina; inserting a mop or broom handle in her vagina and using it to pretend-clean the stage; and finally, inserting pickles in her vagina, which she then put in baggies and sold to the audience, or peanut butter smeared over her genitals, then put on bread and sold to the male audience members. > I started by wheeling out my shopping cart full of surprises. The first > thing I did was stick a mop handle in my puss and clean the stage floor. > Then I pulled the mop handle out of my puss and made a lot of pussy farts. > The audience always got a laugh out of that. I made my puss sound like a > duck. I'd say, \\"I fucked a duck and the duck's still in there!\\" I lit a > candle with a match, then extinguished the flame with my puss. Then I'd blow > out the flame from three candles all at once. After that I put three candles > in my puss, lit them, and stood on my head. I'd count down, and blast-off! > The candles shot out of my puss like a rocket. I call that 'Pussy > Propulsion'. After the candles, I smoked a cigarette in my puss and blew > smoke rings in time with Glenn Miller swing music. This is an old-time trick > for the smoker's stag parties. I used to be afraid of cancer because of the > smoke. Then I pour Jergens lotion into my parts, which I then shoot 20 feet > into the air. The guys within shooting range scatter in all directions! I > joke that the guys who are close to me are in the \\"combat zone.\\" Then I put > talcum powder in my pussy, which I blow out in big white clouds. Then I > shoot ping pong balls out; the powder gives me better grip on the ball so I > can shoot them 15 to 20 feet. I prepare each ball carefully: I write > 'Honeysuckle loves your balls' on them and then I wrap them each up in a > baggie to keep the autograph dry, so whoever catches them can keep them as > souvenirs. SCREW Magazine Bruce David introduced Honeysuckle to Al Goldstein, editor of SCREW. > I first saw Honeysuckle as I walked into Jim Buckley's office, and there was > this girl standing on her head shooting Jergens Lotion across the > room‚Äîejaculating it from her pussy onto the wall 19 feet away. I thought > that was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, we made her our symbol‚Äîlike > the Playboy Rabbit. She is without a doubt the most unhygienic mass of > femininity I've ever encountered. She's a one-woman slum. Honeysuckle is so > dirty even I wouldn't touch her. She would keep an army of 19 shrinks so > busy that they'd need shrinks to take care of them. But you know something? > She's a sweet, nice, almost innocent kind of creature. And she's the only > person on the staff who calls me Mr. Goldstein. Divine wrote a column, \\"Diary of a Dirty Broad\\", for SCREW for several years. She appeared in Goldstein's movie, SOS: Screw on the Screen. In the mid-1970s Divine took a hiatus from her bawdy act after she was arrested several times for obscenity in Philadelphia, Boston, and both Syracuse and Albany, New York. During this time she continued to work as a stripper doing a more conventional routine under a different name. However, Divine made a triumphant return to her original act in February 1976 in Cleveland, Ohio. Divine went on to perform to packed houses all over America. Divine was arrested once again on April 5, 1976 in Philadelphia as a \\"threat to local standards.\\" Charged with open lewdness, the case was quashed and that decision was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because her acts were performed before a consenting audience. In late 1976, Divine began writing a regular column called \\"The Beehive\\" for Cheri magazine. On March 8, 1977, Divine was arrested for performing at the Aquarius Adult Center in Gloucester, New Jersey. This was followed by yet another arrest in New York in April 1977. In January 1979, Divine performed one of her best received shows at the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco. In June 1983, Divine performed as part of a show called \\"Portable Vaudeville\\" at a theater in Amsterdam. Divine continued to tour the country and perform in clubs throughout the mid-1980s. Divine has long since retired from the burlesque and striptease circuits. As of 2014, she was living in a small town in her native Illinois.

The light rail system will link Maroochydore with Caloundra via Mooloolaba and Kawana. The system is currently undergoing feasibility studies and is planned to bring a frequent, high- quality light rail service that will meet the region's predicted growth. History The Sunshine Coast Council reviewed and supported the findings of a pre-feasibility study. In August 2012 the council gave the go-ahead for a full feasibility study to be undertaken. In November 2014, the options were put on display with comments sought with over 700 submissions received.Light rail route options on public display Sunshine Coast Council 3 November 2014Sunshine Coast Council release route options for proposed light rail Brisbane Times 5 November 2014More than 700 have say on Coast's light rail plan Sunshine Coast Daily 17 December 2014 After the council reviewed the outcome of the community consolation in November 2014, they have the confidence to further investigate a light rail corridor. 87% of the survey respondents were in favour of the light rail. As of 2016, the council is exploring potential funding models for the delivery of the project. It noted that the project would still require state government support. In addition, the council and the Department of Transport and Main Roads are seeking to establish a high frequency bus line that will follow the proposed light rail corridor (as a forerunner) of the light rail system. Route Options The proposed system will stretch approximately 20 kilometres from Maroochydore to Caloundra. A full route is still undecided with multiple proposed routes, however following the results of the feasibility study conducted in November 2014, the Sunshine Coast Council have identified a possible route alignment for the light rail. All routes pass through the key activity hubs of Maroochydore, Mooloolaba, Kawana and Caloundra, however various routes are proposed. = Recommended Route Alignment = Following the community consultation, the council has identified a possible route alignment for the light rail. However, this is still undecided and the previous route proposals are still being looked at. The new proposed route will follow Option A of the Maroochydore route, commencing at the Plaza Parade in the Maroochydore CBD before cutting through part of the Horton Park Golf Course, then travelling along Aerdrome Road, this route is the quickest route compared to other proposed routes and supports the Maroochydore City Centre Priority Development Area. The route continues along Aerdrome Road towards Mooloolaba. Following route B of the Mooloolaba proposed routes, the route will turn onto Veening Street, just west of the key activity area of Mooloolaba. Travelling along Walan Street, the route will then turn on to Brisbane Road, continuing south towards Kawana. Once in Kawana the light rail will follow route option A passing the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and supports the development of the Kawana Town Centre. The Caloundra corridor is still undecided. The local council will continue to investigate the three proposed routes to find the best route. = Original corridor route options Proposed Maroochydore routes= 172x172px Maroochydore is the key activity centre on the Sunshine Coast. Option A Option A is the shortest but most direct route resulting in the fastest travel time. This option will start from the Maroochydore CBD and travel along Aerodrome Road towards Mooloolaba. This route option has a wide pedestrian catchment area and supports Maroochydore City Centre Priority Development Area and transit interchange with future heavy rail. Option B A slightly longer route then Option A, Option B will start from the Maroochydore CBD, traveling briefly along Aerodrome Road before going along Kingsford-Smith Parade. This route option has an improved access to the Maroochydore Surf Club and sporting grounds and reduces interference with traffic lights along Aerodrome Road. Option C Option C, although the longest route in the Maroochydore area provides direct access to tourist and residential accommodation and tourist destinations and provides greater access to the Sunshine Plaza, the Sunshine Coast's largest shopping centre. =Proposed Mooloolaba routes= Mooloolaba Mooloolaba is an established lifestyle and tourism destination. Option A Option A provides excellent access to the beach and fantastic iconic views along the Mooloolaba foreshore. This route option also provides good access to retail and dining along the Mooloolaba Esplanade. Option B Option B, travels along the Mooloolaba Esplanade traveling before travelling along Venning Street, just short of the main retail and dining hot spot of Mooloolaba Esplanade. Option B continues along Venning Street and Walan Street before turning on to Brisbane Road and traveling south towards Kawana. Option C Option C is slightly longer than Option A and B but provides access to the Mooloolaba Spit, Wharf precinct and Surf Club. This route option also provides scenic views along the river edge and could support a new river edge lifestyle precinct. Option D Option D is the longest option in the Mooloolaba area, traveling along the Mooloolaba Esplanade, then along River Esplanade before going along Brisbane Road towards Kawana. This route combines the elements of option A and C, providing scenic views along the Mooloolaba foreshore and river edge as well as excellent access to the beach and the retail and dining precinct along the Mooloolaba Esplanade. =Proposed Kawana routes= Kawana is one of the fastest growing regions on the Sunshine Coast. Kawana is proposed as the terminus for stage 1 of the light rail project, with stage 2 continuing from Kawana to Caloundra. Option A Option A would be the longest route in the Kawana area and has a number of tight turns, increasing travel time. This route would provide direct access to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and supports the development of the Kawana Town Centre, Business Village and Bokarina Beach. This option also provides future opportunity for a fully integrated transport interchange with a heavy rail station. Option B Option B followings a similar route to Option A, however aiming to improve on travel time by passing the core of the Kawana Town Centre. This route option, like Option A provides access to the University Hospital and an interchange with a future heavy rail station. This route also travels through the Kawana Industrial Estate. Option C Option C provides access to local schools and sporting facilities and services the existing eastern residential areas of Kawana. The route travels through the Kawana Industrial Estate and supports the development of Bokarina Beach. Option C is a more direct and faster route towards Caloundra then Option's A and B. Option D Option D is both the most cheapest and fastest route in the Kawana area, however it limits access to the key destinations of the region. Option D still provides good access to local schools and sporting grounds. This option services the existing eastern residential areas but has over one kilometer walking distance to the key destinations such as the University Hospital and the Kawana Town Centre. =Proposed Caloundra routes= Caloundra Caloundra is a major lifestyle and tourism destination situated at the southern end of the Sunshine Coast. Option A Option A will travel directly on Nicklin Way to maximize travel speed and provides excellent access to Bulcock Street and Omrah Avenue. The route supports direct access to West Terrace hospital precinct and the RSL club. This route also provides good access to potential development sites along the central areas of Caloundra and partly services the western residential areas, however it bypasses a number of coastal tourist destinations. Option B This option supports direct access to Moffat Bach business and industry precinct as well as direct access to sporting facilities and the Caloundra Primary School. Option B partly services the western residential area and connects commuters with Stockland Caloundra shopping centre. Option C Option C is the longest option in the Caloundra region but provides access with recreation and tourism destinations which the other two options lack as well as the residential areas of central Caloundra. This route provides good access to sporting facilities and the local primary school and establishes strong connectivity to the beach.

The parish receives its name from the date of the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat which overthrew dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. HistoryMarcos P√©rez Jim√©nez government= In the early 1950s, under the government of General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez a Housing Unit apartments designed by architect Guido Berm√∫dez on the model of \\"Cit√© Radieuse\\" Swiss Le Corbusier, also used in the Unit was built Housing Tlatelolco (Mexico) with apartments that were granted to the population of middle and lower classes of Caracas. Initially \\"Urbanization December 2\\" would be called (in commemoration of the coup by Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez). However, the current name was assigned by his successor, R√≥mulo Betancourt, with the date January 23 (23 de enero) commemorating the overthrow of the general and marking beginning of democracy in Venezuela. In 1966, it was decided to separate 23 de Enero from the Sucre Parish and place it under the \\"parish\\" category, keeping the same name of \\"23 de Enero\\". The parish has had a history of social struggle since then. =Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez government= During the presidency of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, the Caracazo, a wave of protests, riots, looting, shootings and massacres, occurred in Caracas hat began on 27 February 1989. 23 de Enero was the one of the first areas in Caracas that began to riot and loot. Hugo Ch√°vez also organized the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts while in 23 de enero. =Bolivarian government= Since 15 March 2013, the remains of former president Hugo Ch√°vez now rest in the Museum of the Bolivarian Revolution (Cuartel 4 de febrero), also known as the \\"Monta√±a Barracks\\", the very spot where the coup attempt of 1992 was launched. Geography It is located northwest of Caracas, nestled in a series of hills, adjacent to the Catia and Sucre parishes. It is a predominantly residential area, with major recreation areas. It is under the municipal government of the Mayor of the Libertador Bolivarian Municipality and the city of Caracas, also being under the regional jurisdiction of the Government of the Capital District , which are in charge of public works in the sectors grouped in 23 de Enero. The security service consists of the Bolivarian National Police (PNB), as well as the Venezuelan Army, which has the Cipriano Castro Barracks in the vicinity of the parish, and the Directorate General of the National Reserve (General Command of the National Militia), with headquarters in the Montana Barracks. =Sectors= The parish also has separate sectors such as el Observatorio, La Piedrita, La Silsa, Mirador, El Sam√°n, La Ca√±ada, La zona Central, Monte Piedad, Zona F and others. Demographics As of 2009, the population of was 84,650. Most of the area is composed of slums of squatters who have remained in the area since the overthrow of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez in 1958. =Crime= 23 de Enero has a reputation of violence, robbery, kidnapping and drug trafficking. Colectivos such as the Tupamaros occupy the area where they allegedly partake in or combat crime. Colectivo members patrol the area thoroughly with some possessing armbands with the Venezuelan flag, firearms and radios.

He was a member of Thomas Girtin's sketching society in 1799, and one of the earliest workers in lithography. His death, in or soon after 1823, was accidental, caused by an old wall falling on him while he was sketching.

Nurse was reunited with her biological parents, Morne and Celeste Nurse, 17 years later after DNA tests confirmed her identity.  Kidnapping  Celeste Nurse delivered Zephany on 27 April 1997 by caesarean section in the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Celeste described a person in a nurse's uniform comforting her while her baby was still in the nearby cot, before falling asleep. When Celeste had woken up, a nurse kept asking her where the baby was, and at this point she realized that Zephany had been taken. The hospital contacted the police for assistance in searching the hospital; however only a few untraceable items were found, including Zephany's baby nest, a baby garment, and a handbag with no identifiable items. A pillow was found in a tunnel that was intended to provide women in labour direct access to the ward from the street. The tunnel also provided access to the old main building, psychiatric department and out- patient section, which at the time had unrestricted access. The Nurse family believe the kidnapper took precautions to move through the ward unnoticed. The pillow was probably used to fake a pregnancy, as no one questions a pregnant woman moving around in a maternity ward. The woman, now dressed as a nurse in maroon pants and oatmeal top, made an effort to befriend the mothers in the ward. One of the expectant mothers, who remembered the kidnapper's face, had spoken to her briefly. On another occasion, this same mother found her holding her baby, and when questioned the woman replied that the baby had been crying and she was comforting it. In a later interview Celeste Nurse said: \\"Her intention was to steal a child, she didn't care which child it was.\\" Five days after Zephany's birth, the Nurse family went home without their daughter.  Search  Celeste Nurse clung to the hope that what happened was not real, or a kind of sick joke and that someone would bring her daughter. \\"We came home to nothing.\\" Every year since the kidnapping, the Nurse family would celebrate Zephany's birthday on 28 April, in an attempt to keep the search for her in the media. Celeste has also given a number of interviews, many at times when other kidnappings have occurred, always offering support to the affected families. In at least two instances the Nurse family were given hope that their daughter would be returned home. One woman, whose neighbors had not noticed her pregnancy, was investigated by the police, however while the child closely resembled the missing Zephany, it was a boy. In another instance, after almost 12 years of no news, in July 2009 the Nurses received a phone call in which a woman whispered, \\"I know about your daughter,\\" and asked for 500,000 South African Rand (approx US $70,000 in 2009) to be delivered at a prearranged place. Police were contacted, and the drop off monitored, however no one arrived to collect the money. The call was later traced to Glenda Doubell, a neighbor of Celeste Nurse's mother, who was charged with extortion and was given 3 years house arrest, ZAR 5,000 fine and 600 hours community service.  Finding Zephany  The Nurses' second daughter, Cassidy Nurse, started at a new school where Zephany, now aged seventeen, coincidentally was also in attendance under the name Mich√© Solomon. Friends of Zephany commented on the uncanny resemblance between the two girls, and despite their 4-year age difference, they formed an almost immediate friendship. Once Morne Nurse heard about the physical similarities between the two girls, he arranged with Cassidy to meet Zephany at a local takeaway. After this first meeting, Morne contacted the investigating officer in the disappearance of Zephany. The police began an investigation and, after Zephany's parents could not provide proof of her birth, DNA tests were conducted. The results were conclusive that Zephany was in fact the Nurses' child, and she was removed to a place of safety by the Department of Social Services. The Nurse family were granted visitations, and apparently Zephany was already calling them mother and father at this time. In March 2016, a woman, who was not named for legal reasons, was convicted of the abduction. In August 2016, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison; her name was still withheld \\"to protect the identity she gave to [the] baby.\\"  Identity revealed  Zephany Nurse, whose new name was kept a secret for five years, applied for the ban restricting the publication of her real name (Mich√© Solomon) to be lifted, which was granted by the high court in Pretoria on 13 August 2019. Hours after the ban was lifted, Zephany announced that her book entitled Zephany: Two mothers, one daughter, an astonishing true story would hit shelves. Mich√© Solomon, as she is now called after the high court ruling on 13 August 2019, dedicated the book to both mothers in an article by Times Live. Her kidnapper was identified as Lavona Solomon.BBC News,\\"The selfie that revealed I was a stolen baby\\" October 27,2019  References  Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1997 births Category:1997 in South Africa Category:2015 in South Africa Category:Formerly missing people Category:Kidnappings in South Africa Category:Kidnapped South African children Category:Kidnapped South African people Category:Living people ","title":"Zephany Nurse"},{"id":"45626404","text":"Danny King-Bisungu (born 30 August 1993 in Kinshasa) is a Congolese football player.

Despite being most notable for their defense of Roman polytheism and traditional Roman culture (especially by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus) during the Theodosian persecution of paganism, the family also had several distinguished Christian members during the Ante-Nicene Period, including an early pope, Symmachus. The Christian philosopher Boethius was adopted into the family as a child, and named his son Symmachus in their honor. Being at the centre of the many political trials and tribulations both before and after the sack of Rome, the family declined significantly. Several members were executed for their political allegiances and religious beliefs, especially by the Goths and Vandals.History of the Wars, 5.1.34. Text and translation in H. B.

The heroic 28-day long siege resulted in pyrrhic Muslim victory and execution of the Georgian commander Gobron. Despite the important victory, the invaders were unable to maintain a strong foothold in western Georgia and were forced to withdraw. Background The most detailed information about the event is described by a contemporary Georgian hagiographer Stephen of Tbeti in his best-known work Passion of Gobron. Before beginning their destructive campaign in Georgian kingdoms and principalities, the Sajids overran Caucasian Albania and Armenia, executing king Smbat I. After pillaging 87 settlements in eastern Georgia and capturing Ujarma and Bochorma fortresses in Kakheti, the Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan, known as Abu l'Kasim in Georgia and Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj elsewhere, launched his massive army to Uplistsikhe, only to find the fortifications demolished by their defenders in order to prevent him from gaining a foothold in the vicinity. From there, the amir surged into Samtskhe and Javakheti. Unable to seize control of the stronghold of Tmogvi, he besieged the castle of Q'ueli (Q'uelis-Tsikhe), which was a fief of a prominent Georgian feudal, Gurgen II of Tao.Machitadze, p. 414-415 Siege The defense of the fortress was headed by Gobron, a military commander on Gurgen's court. The size of the Muslim army, which included siege engines, was so colossal that the camps set up by its soldiers would cover the expanses of five villages: The Georgians, despite being vastly outnumbered, sporadically launched sorties, inflicting heavy casualties on the opposing force. On the other hand, the Muslims constantly bombarded the castle walls and fortifications with catapults and trebuchets, gradually bringing the castle walls down. At the twenty-eighth day of the siege, the walls came down and the fortress was overrun, putting the most of its defenders in captivity.Silogava, p. 64-65 Aftermath Despite the large ransom sent by Gurgen, Yusuf refused to release his prisoners and decided to hold onto Mikel-Gobron as well as 133 others. Gobron, despite Yusuf's multiple attempts, firmly rejected to convert to Islam. According to The Passion of the Holy Martyr Gobron, the Georgian commander who was stubbornly refusing Yusuf's proposal, was ordered to bow down for execution. After the first strike of the sword, Gobron made the sign of the cross with blood on his forehead and exclaimed, \\"I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, that you have accounted me, the most contemptible and chief among sinners, worthy to lay down my life for your sake!\\". The enraged Muslim general ordered the rest of the men to be massacred and their bodies left to the wild beasts.Thomas, p. 142-144 Despite securing the hard-earned castle of Q'ueli, the Sajids were forced to evacuate Tao-Klarjeti due to increasing Georgian power in the west. The general partisan warfare strategy carried out by the Georgians inflicted heavy casualties to the invaders during their campaign in western Georgia.Machitadze, p. 416 NotesReferencesFurther reading * Silogava, Valeri; Shengelia, Kakha (2007). \\"History of Georgia: From the Ancient Times Through the Rose Revolution\\".

Before this, a dissolution of parliament was not required except on the demise of the Crown, and the previous three general elections were held in 1715, 1727, and 1761, on the respective deaths of Anne, George I, and George II.McGrath 2001, p.12 After the act, general elections were held in 1769, 76, 83, 90, and 98. Limiting the duration of parliament was a prime objective of the Patriot Party. Heads of bills were brought, by Charles Lucas in 1761 and 1763 and by Henry Flood in 1765, to limit parliament to seven years as the Septennial Act 1716 did for the Parliament of Great Britain. The heads were rejected by the Privy Council of Great Britain, which, under Poynings' Law, had to pre-approve any bill before it was formally introduced in the Irish parliament. Since the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the British government had wished to increase the size of Irish regiments, the part of the British Army charged on the Irish exchequer rather than the British.Bartlett 1981, p.541 In 1767, the Chatham Ministry appointed George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and instructed him to secure the support of the Irish parliament for an Augmentation Bill to effect this increase. The British considered several possible concessions to win over the Patriot Party,Bartlett 1981, p.547 and at his speech from the throne, Townshend promised judicial tenure quamdiu se bene gesserint (on the model of the Act of Settlement 1701) and hinted at a Septennial Act.Bartlett 1981, p.546 Lucas again introduced heads of a Septennial Bill on 20 October 1767; Barry Maxwell introduced heads of a judicial tenure bill the same day. In November, the appointment of James Hewitt, 1st Baron Lifford as Lord Chancellor of Ireland alienated the Undertakers who had hoped for the post. In addition, the British Privy Council added a wrecking clause to the judicial tenure bill, which caused the Irish parliament to reject the bill once returned to Dublin.Bartlett 1981, p.548 The council also made three amendments to Lucas' bill: to the preamble, to extend the limit from seven to eight years (thus an Octennial Bill) and to bring forward the date of the next general election from 1774 to 1768.Bartlett 1981, p.555 According to Francis Plowden, the Privy Council insisted on the modification to eight years as a wrecking amendment, expecting that the Irish parliament would reject the bill on principle once any amendment had been made to it, and was disappointed when its amended bill was passed. W. E. H. Lecky calls this \\"without foundation\\", stating the actual reasons for eight years were that the Irish Parliament only met every second year, and to reduce the chance of Irish and British general elections coinciding. The Octennial Act reinvigorated the Commons, both with newly elected reformers and with MPs made more active by the prospect of imminent re-election. Changes included more assertiveness over supply bills and Poynings' Law,McGrath 2001, p.24; Bartlett 1979, p.76 easing the penal laws, and securing the Constitution of 1782. There were unsuccessful attempts to shorten the maximum duration, in 1773 by Sir William Parsons and in 1777 by Sir Edward Newenham. The act was rendered moot when the Parliament of Ireland was abolished by the Act of Union 1800. It was formally repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1879.

On 30 October 1916, she became the first female to be accepted into an institute of architects in Australia. This followed the rejection of earlier female applicants, including Florence Taylor in 1907, on the grounds of being female. Life and work Born 16 July 1893 at The Folly, Lakes Creek, central Queensland, Beatrice Hutton was the second of seven children of a grazier and surveyor Falconer West Hutton and Clara Susannah, n√©e Holt. Her early life was spent on the family property at Comet Down. Drought forced the family off the land in 1902 and they moved to Rockhampton in 1906 where she was educated at Rockhampton Grammar School. Beatrice Hutton did not undertake any formal architectural education, but began her training in Rockhampton firstly, in her father‚Äôs surveying office. She initially wanted to pursue a career in surveying but had to \\"accept architecture as the nearest feasible alternative\\". Later, she was an articled pupil in Hocking and Palmer, the architectural office of Edwin Morton Hockings. She became the firm's chief draftsperson during Hockings' war service. Hutton became the first woman admitted to an architectural institute in Australia, when she was accepted as a member of the Queensland Institute of Architects on 30 October 1916. The Sydney architectural journal The Salon announced: > \\"The Queensland Institute is, we believe, the first Australian Institute of > Architecture to admit a lady member...The credentials placed before the > Institute Council by the candidate showed that Miss Hutton was an earnest > and industrious student, and the application was supported by her > principals.\\" It is not yet clear what constituted her contribution to the work of Hockings and Palmer, however, several wide verandahed houses in Rockhampton have been attributed to Hutton's early career, such as the now heritage-listed Rudd Residence. Houses were Hutton's particular interest and like other early women architects, she felt that women had a significant role in designing houses that were suitable for the climate and that utilised labour saving features. Her career progressed following her move to Sydney in late 1916, where her work focussed mainly on residential projects, as well as the New South Wales Masonic Club building (1927) and Sirius House in Macquarie Place. From April 1917 she worked for expatriate Queensland architect, Claude William Chambers, becoming a junior partner from 1931 to 1933. The firm was listed for those years as \\"Chambers and Hutton\\" in Sands New South Wales Directory, and it may be that Hutton was the only woman practising as a principal in Sydney at the time. She returned to Rockhampton in 1934 to care for her elderly parents, effectively ending her architectural career. Hutton believed that women had a valuable contribution to make in the design of the residential realm, ‚Äúin the design of homes suited to climate and equipped for modern living‚Äù, and she is best known for her residential work, in Rockhampton and Sydney. Later life In 1933, Hutton's career was cut short, due to her father‚Äôs failing health, when she moved back to Rockhampton to care for him and her aging mother. After her father died, Hutton moved to Brisbane with her mother in 1936 and opened an art studio in the Colonial Mutual Life Building in Queen Street where she exhibited and sold her wood carvings. Judith Mackay wrote in 1984, when Hutton was 90, that \\"Beatrice Hutton currently lives surrounded by an impressive array of her own handwork in wood carving, pottery and rug-making. Her sustained enthusiasm for using her creative skills is inspirational. She exhibited and sold her work in a studio she opened with her mother, called ‚ÄòThe Glory Box‚Äô, in Brisbane. In her later life, she continued to develop her craft work, with a brief return to architecture practice in 1940.\\" Hutton died on 7 October 1990 at Indooroopilly, Brisbane, and was cremated. She is commemorated by the Beatrice Hutton Award for Commercial Architecture, given by the Australian Institute of Architects Queensland Chapter, the Beatrice Hutton room in the Rockhampton Art Gallery, and the Beatrice Hutton House of Capricornia College, in Central Queensland University, Rockhampton.

She gave birth to Asuras, or demons, who were also known as Krodhavasas. As she was very short-tempered, the children born to her were ferocious animals, birds, and fish, all monsters species with sharp teeth. Offspring In one version it is said that Krodhavasa had ten daughters: Mrgi, Mrgamanda, Harl, Bhadramata, Matarigl, Sarduli, Sveta, Surabhi, Sarasa, and Kadru. According to Vanaparva of Mahabharata, some of Krodhavasa's sons worked as guards at Kubera's lotus lake. Once Bhima, one of the Pandavas, came to the lotus lake and started picking Saugandhika flowers. Krodhavasas went to Kubera complaining about it. It is also said that Krodhavasas worked in the army of Ravana of Ramayana fame. A legend According to a story from the epic Mahabharata, which was adopted into a drama, Bhima is on a pilgrimage to Gandharvamadana to pluck some Saugandhika flowers to gift them to Draupadi. A Brahmin sage warns Bhima not to go there, as he himself was incapable of going up the mountain to pluck the flowers because of old age. Meanwhile, a Saugandhika flower from the inaccessible mountain is carried by the wind and falls on Draupadi, while she had sent Bhima to fetch that very flower. Bhima, holding his mace and blowing a conch, walks through the thick forest to scare wild animals on his way to the mountain lake. While he walks through the forest, a strong wind (Vayu, representing Bhima's father) carries to him the sweet smell of the flower. His approach scares away the demons and spirits who were guarding the lake. Bhima then gathers the flowers from the lake. Krodhavasa then enters the lake with a drawn sword and threatens Bhima. Bhima informs the demon that even Rama, a man, could kill demons. Bhima then attacks Krodhavasa with his mace and breaks his sword. Krodhavasa runs away in fright. Then Kubera appears on the scene and tells Bhima to take as many flowers as he wants.

It later formed a branch of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind by the name Jamiat Ulema- e-Bangala in 1921. History The association was established in March 1913 at a conference in Beniapara, Bogra by some of Bengal's most senior scholars such as Abul Kalam Azad, Muhammad Abdullahil Baqi and Muhammad Shahidullah. The first president and secretary of the Anjuman was Mohammad Akram Khan with Maniruzzaman Islamabadi as joint secretary. Ismail Hossain Siraji was also a notable member of the organisation. Aiming to bring about Muslim unity, regardless of sects, and prevent Muslims from converting to Christianity. On 3 May 1915, the association initiated an illustrated monthly Bengali publication known as Al-Eslam, with Akram as chief editor. Notable writers for the paper included Begum Rokeya and Fazlul Hoque Selbarsi. Over 1500 copies were in circulation. It contained articles on history, literature, philosophy, and cultural heritage. Two years later, they hosted their second conference in Calcutta. The third conference took place in Patiya in August 1919. Promoting Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity, the organisation actively participated in anti-colonial uprisings such as the Khilafat Movement as well as Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement. They opened a Swadeshi-Khilafat store in Calcutta, promoting the sale of native goods. The uprisings changed the socio-politics in India and the association was eventually disbanded in 1921 to merge with the Jamiat Ulema-e-Bangala, a regional branch of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind. Aims Its aims included providing Islamic education, countering hostility and misconceptions preached by Christian missionaries as well as reforming and uniting Muslim society to an orthodox fashion through the Quran and Sunnah. This included actively educating unlettered and illiterate Muslims of Bengal and Assam about shirk and bid ªah. At the same time, the organisation promoted Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity. Many maktabs, madrasas, bayt al-mal and social arbitration boards were founded and funded by the organisation; bringing about solidarity and a strong morale amongst Muslims. They popularised the use of the Bengali language amongst the Muslim middle-class. There was also an aspiration of establishing an Islamic university in Chittagong although this never came into being.

SKAT performs across the country as well as in China, the UK, Germany, Laos and Sri Lanka. The Surya Kirans were among the top three nine-aircraft aerobatics teams in the world, along with the British Red Arrows and the Canadian Snowbirds. Also known as The Sharks, No 52 Squadron was initially established on 1 January 1986, and is the youngest of IAF's fighter squadrons. The Sharks flew the MiG-21 FL and were used in MiG Operational Fighter Training. They were briefly used in OAS role in 1996, before being 'number- plated' (deactivated), in June 2005. The Squadron motto is \\"Sadaiv Sarvottam\\", which translates as \\"Always the Best\\". For its consistent performance since 1996, the Suryakiran was awarded Chief of the Air Staff's Unit Citation on 8 October 2004. It is the first unit in the IAF to receive this award.

However, during peacetime the Squadron was given the additional responsibility of conducting MOFT syllabus of young pilots. The Squadron moved to Bagdogra on January 1990. On 1 November 1996 the Squadron moved to 14 Wing at Chabua. Formation aerobatics has been a part of IAF aviation history since it was established. The Surya Kiran (which means 'sunbeam' in Sanskrit) squadron was conceived in 1996 to serve as Ambassadors who would showcase the prowess of the Air Force's fighter pilots in precision aerobatic flying. The SKAT was a successor of the earlier display team, the 'Thunderbolts', who performed in the early 1980s.

The GGS directly supports the British Forces Germany garrison security mission. British Forces Germany (BFG) is the name for British Armed Forces service personnel and civilians based in Germany. It was first established following the Second world war as the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). Although much smaller than the BAOR, it is still the largest concentration of British armed forces permanently stationed outside the United Kingdom. With the end of the Cold War and the Options for Change defence review in the early 1990s, BFG has been considerably reduced. Since the 1990s, the British presence has centred on the 1st Armoured Division, and supporting elements. BFG is concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The concept of the GGS from the beginning was to employ local civilian volunteers in performing Armed security functions alongside British Forces. The GGS has been in service for decades, it is a civilian volunteer paramilitary (as defined under German laws) security force responsible for providing security of BFG garrisons in Germany. Hiring of GGS personnel is the responsibility of the Garrison Labor Support Unit which supports all major UK Forces garrisons within Germany. All GGS personnel are subject to in-depth vetting and receive local clearance once hired. The GGS receives formal training by MOD (Army) and MOD Police force instructors. The initial three week qualification course is held at Sennelager, Paderborn garrison, Germany. This course prepares personnel for their duties by qualifying in knowledge of UK Army standard operating procedures regarding anti-terrorism measures, weapons qualification, communications, security procedures, use of force, self-defense techniques, access control, security systems monitoring, the GGS professional development program, driver qualifications, command structure and integration with Army security and Royal Military Police operations, as well as general orders, authority, and uniform in the garrison environment. GGS primary duties include access and badge control, vehicle searches, static security, roving foot and vehicle patrols, surveillance detection, CCTV and alarm systems monitoring, security checks, as well as acting as quasi interpreters by using their German language skills (required) when interacting with local contractors and authorities. The GGS is not a policing organisation and holds no police authority. They are however integrated into the Army‚Äôs 24/7 Armed security operation and may detain violators and use force measures appropriate to secure the garrison, up to and including deadly force when necessary. Uniform ‚Äì The GGS uniform is very similar to the other MOD security and Police uniforms. The uniform consists of royal blue or navy blue slacks with cargo pockets, black boots, a royal blue or dark blue blouse (supervisors may wear a white blouse) with shoulder markings, a dark blue beret with emblem, duty belt, a black tie for specific occasions, black gloves, service weapon, radio, baton, and ID badge. The GGS does have a formal rank system that is based on the civil service structure and rankings. The majority of GGS volunteers are German nationals, but there has been diversity within the force that includes local expat employees (usually former military) including British, French, Dutch, and US personnel among the ranks.http://www.sixth-sense- newspaper.de/1488-judge-s-praise-for-soldier-who-faced-teen-gunman See also *British Forces Germany ReferencesExternal links *Germany Guard Service Badge *NATO JHQ, Germany Guard Service Office, Flickr page Category:Law enforcement in Germany ","title":"Germany Guard Service"},{"id":"45626862","text":"Camponotus mendax is a species of carpenter ant (genus Camponotus).

In 1984 he became, as matters turned out, the last head of the service's Central Department for surveillance, fact finding and arrests (\\" / Section VIII\\"). LifeEarly years= Coburger was born in a very small village roughly 10 km (6 miles) south of Sonneberg in rural Thuringia, a couple of weeks before a Stock market crash in New York heralded a decade of economic challenges on both sides of the Atlantic. His father was a porcelain worker. He completed his basic schooling in 1943 and switched to a trade focused secondary school for a basic commercial training. He was halfway through his three year period here in May 1945 when the war ended, and after the invading armies had repositioned themselves in order to align reality with their previous agreements, the whole of Thuringia ended up in the Soviet occupation zone of what had been Germany. Between 1946 and 1948 Coburger attended the Economics Senior School in Sonneberg, and then, in 1948/49 worked as an informal trainee at the \\"Plastewerk\\" factory in the town's K√∂ppelsdorf quarter. The entire zone operated under Soviet Administration till it became a separate German state, the German Democratic Republic formally founded in October 1949. Long before that, in April 1946, the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD had created the basis for a return to one-party rule in this portion of Germany. Coburger joined the new Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED), which had resulted from the merger, in 1949, the year of his twentieth birthday. He studied for a year at the prestigious \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" National Administration Academy (Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft) and then, till 1952, took a job as a commercial assistant, while simultaneously progressing his education through evening classes. =The Ministry for State Security= In 1952 Coburger joined the Ministry for State Security (MfS / Stasi). He worked initially at the Stasi regional administrative office in Leipzig, before being posted to Berlin in 1953. Here he became lead investigator in \\" (\\"Section IX\\"). Interrogation techniques applied by Coburger against political detainees included psychological torture such as sleep deprivation and isolation- detention. These methods were used to force victims to make incriminating statements which were then used in the preparation of political show trials. This was part of the elaborate approach taken to prepare the high-profile trial of Elli Barczatis, a former chief secretary in the office of Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl. Barczatis was executed by guillotine on 23 November 1955 (but rehabilitated by a Berlin district court on 28 November 2006)Landgericht Berlin, Gesch√§ftsnummer (551 Rh), 3 Js 322/06 (331/06). Between 1957 and 1960 Coburger undertook a correspondence degree course in Crimininalistics - technological aspects of criminology with the Police Academy in Aschersleben. He passed his professional exams in the subject at the Humboldt University of Berlin, albeit only in 1966. That was also the year in which he was promoted, becoming deputy president of the Investigation Department. Ten years later, under a slightly unusual arrangement, he received jointly a doctorate with two other Stasi officers for a \\"collective dissertation\\" which bore the title \\"Enforcement by the Ministry for State Security of Criminal Responsibility on citizens on non-socialist states\\".‚ÄûDie Durchsetzung der strafrechtlichen Verantwortung von B√ºrgern nichtsozialistischer Staaten durch das MfS‚Äú \\"Non-socialist states\\" (\\"nichtsozialistischer Staaten\\") in this context will have been taken at the time as a thinly veiled reference to West Germany. The doctorate was awarded by the recently renamed Potsdam Legal Academy (Juristische Hochschule Potsdam). In 1984 Karli Coburger was promoted to the rank of Major general and appointed to the headship of the service's \\"Section VIII\\" (Surveillande, Investigations and Arrests) in succession to . He held this office till 1989. As the single party dictatorship and its Ministry for State Security dissolved, Coburger was released from his duties in 1990. He became an active participant in Historical revisionist movements that quickly emerged,Hubertus Knabe: Die T√§ter sind unter uns. √úber das Sch√∂nreden der SED-Diktatur. Berlin 2008, p. 304 notably the Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support (GSV / Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanit√§ren Unterst√ºtzung), formally established in 1993 by former East German politicians and Stasi officers in response to a growing number of legal cases focusing on legal abuses allegedly committed under the old one-party dictatorship that had been East Germany until 1990. In 2003 Coburg was one of a number of former Stasi officers to provide a filmed interview apparently intended to highlight positive aspects from the Stasi record in East Germany, with one of his fellow interviewees, Erich Mielke, characterising the old days with the phrase \\"A warm heart and clean hands!\\": the interview failed to gain much coverage or to impress reviewers. =Trial and conviction= On 14 December 1992 the Public Prosecutor (Generalbundesanwalt) preferred charges against Coburg in respect of his intelligence service activities.Roland Schi√üau: Strafverfahren wegen MfS-Unrecht - Die Strafprozesse bundesdeutscher Gerichte gegen ehemalige Mitarbeiter des Ministeriums f√ºr Staatssicherheit der DDR, Berlin 2006, , p. 151.

Oregon law specifically bans mutual combat, according to subsection three of ORS 161.215: \\"a person is not justified in using physical force upon another person if: the physical force involved is the product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.\\" There have been numerous cases where this concept was successfully used in defense of the accused. In some cases, mutual combat may nevertheless result in killings. Notable examples In 2012, MMA fighter Phoenix Jones hit the headlines for engaging in mutual combat. A video of the fight went viral. The Seattle Police Department later defended their officers for not intervening. The Seattle Municipal Code 12A.06.025 states that \\"It is unlawful for any person to intentionally fight with another person in a public place and thereby create a substantial risk of: 1. Injury to a person who is not actively participating in the fight; or 2. Damage to the property of a person who is not actively participating in the fight.\\" Thus since the fight did not injure a third party or damage property, it was not disallowed by this law. Also in 2012, Gabriel Aubry and Olivier Martinez engaged in mutual combat and were not charged. In 2014, after Zac Efron had engaged in a fight in Skid Row, law enforcement officials did not make any arrests because they viewed it as mutual combat. Mutual combat has been used to deny damage claims, as a legal defense, and to drop charges against fighting students.

Recorded in epic history and ruled by Bhils and descendants of Maitraka of Vallabhi, its history traced back to the 7th century. The region was ruled by Rajput clans. Initially Parihar Rajput refounded Idar and ruled until its chief died in the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192. Idar then fell into the hands of a Koli named Hathi Sora who was succeeded by his son Samalio. The latter was killed by a Rathod prince named Sonangji, who occupied Idar, and became the founder of the dynasty of the Rao Rajputs who ruled there for several generations. After numerous changes of fortune and many struggles with the Muslims rulers of Gujarat, the Rao Rajputs had at last to leave Idar, and were, in 1728, succeeded by the Rathod dynasty from Marwar. They ruled Idar State for generations and became part of Mahi Kantha agency under British. On independence of India in 1947, Idar became part of the Indian Union. Legends Idar is first known in tradition as Ilvadurg, the residence in the Dvapara Yuga, or third age, of Elvan the Rakshasa, and his brother Vatapi. These demons who harassed and laid waste the country round, were at last destroyed by the seer Agastya. The town is mentioned in Mahabharata and Bhavishottar Puran as 'Ilvadurg'. In the Kali Yuga, or present age, when Yudhishthira was ruling over Hastinapur at the end of the Kurukshetra War of Mahabharata, Veni Vachh Raj ruled in Idar. He owned a magic gold figure which gave him money for building the Idar fortress and reservoirs. Veni Vachh Raj's queen was a Nagputri, the daughter of one of the Snake Kings of the under world. After living together happily for some time, as they were seated in an oriental window in Idargadh, a corpse, followed by mourners, chanced to pass. Asking what the procession meant, the Rani was told that one of them was dead and that the rest were mourning. 'Let us leave a place where men die' said the Rani, and she and the king went together to the hill of Taran Mata, and entering a cleft in the rock, close to where the goddess is now worshipped, they were no more seen. Then the land lay desolate for many years. Early history The first clear tradition shows Idar in the possession of Bhils. When Vallabhi fell in 770, Pushpavati or Kamalavati, one of the queens of Maitraka king Shiladitya, was at the Arasur shrine of Amba Bhavani at Ambaji, fulfilling a vow, for the goddess had heard her prayer and she was with child. On her way back Pushpavati heard that Vallabhi had fallen and that she was a widow. Taking refuge in a mountain cave, she was delivered of a son, whom she named Gruhaditya or 'Goha', the Cave-born. Leaving the baby in the charge of a Brahman woman, and telling her to bring him up as one of her own sons but to marry him to a Rajput's daughter, she committed Sati by mounting the funeral pile. Idar was then in the hands of the Bhils, and the young Goha, leaving his Brahman mother, took to the woods with the Bhils, and, by his daring, won their hearts. One day the Bhils in sport choosing a king, the choice fell on Goha, and one 'of the children of the forest' cutting his finger rubbed the blood on Goha's forehead as the sovereign mark, tilak. Thus Goha, the son of Shiladitya, became lord of the forests and mountains of Idar. His descendants are said to have ruled for seven generations, till the Bhils tired of strangers, attacked and slew Nagaditya or Aparajita, the eighth prince of the line. His infant son Bappa Rawal, then only three years old, was saved to become, twelve years later (974), the founder of the Mewar dynasty. Then the city fell into ruins. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang (640) mentions a place which he calls O-clia-li, the Chinese way of writing Vadali, a village nearby. British General Cunningham identified this place with Idar. He further noted that in the eleventh century Vadali or Vadari was the capital of a family of chiefs claiming descent from Raja Bhara Gupta, whom the General believed to be the same as the above-mentioned Bappa. =Parihar Rajput rule= Some time after, a band of Parihar Rajputs, from Mandovar in Marwar, binding the garland upon its gates, refounded Idar, and ruled there for several generations. In the time of one of these Parihar rulers, Amarsingh by name, the Raja of Kanauj, performing a sacrifice in honour of his daughter's marriage, sent letters of invitation to the neighbouring kings. Idar was then subject to Chittor, and Samarsinh Rawal of Chitor, invited by his brother-in-law Prithviraj to accompany him to the marriage, summoned his vassal Amarsingh to attend him. The Parihar chieftain, with his son and a body of five thousand horse, went to Chittor, and took part with Prithviraj Chauhan, king of Delhi, against the Ghurid Sultanate and was killed in the Battles of Tarain (1193). When the news reached Idar, many of the queens cast themselves from the steep cliff to the north of the town, still known as the 'Ranis' Leap' or 'Murder Hill'. Idar then fell into the hands of a Koli named Hathi Sora who was succeeded by his son Samalio. Rao rule (1257‚Äì1300) Driven south by the Muslims, the Rathods, about the end of the twelfth century, under the guidance of Siyoji, the son or nephew of Jaychand Dale Panglo of Kanauj, established themselves in the sandy deserts of Marwar. Siyoji's second son, Sonangji, repaired to the court of Anhilwad Patan, whose sovereign, probably Bhim Dev II (1177-1215) of Chaulukya dynasty, assigned him the fief of Sametra in the district of Kadi. And not many years after the Rathods won for themselves the fort aud lands of Idar in 1257. The local story of this conquest is, that Samalio Sora by his tyranny roused his subjects' discontent. His chief adviser, a Nagar Brahmin, had a beautiful daughter, whom Samalio demanded in marriage. The father, not daring to refuse, begged half a year's delay. This was granted, and in the interval he paid a visit to Sametra, and, introducing himself to Sonangji, asked him if he was bold enough to take Idar. Sonangji agreed to try, and the Brahmin, returning home, declared that he was making preparations for the marriage and was assembling his relations. By twos and threes a hundred carriages, supposed to contain Brahmin women, brought to the minister's mansion the Rathod warriors and their leader. The minister at length gave out that all was ready, and asked Samalio and his relations to the feast. After the arrival of the bridegroom and his party, intoxicating drugs and liquor were freely served, and, on the minister's ordering his servants to bring the second course, the Rajputs rushed forward and surrounded the banquet hall. Samalio strove to cut his way through his enemies and regain the fortress, but, within a short distance of the gate of Idargadh, fell mortally wounded. When Sonangji came to the spot where he lay dying, Samalio, raising himself for the last time, made the royal mark on the victorious Rathod's brow, and with his dying breath begged that each Rathod Rao on mounting the royal cushion should be marked with the tilak by a Sora, who should draw the blood from his own right hand, and say 'May the kingdom of Samalio Sora flourish.' Spots on the ascent to Idargad, still pointed to as Samalio's blood stains, are marked by the Hindus with vermilion on Kali Chaudas and other days on which Hanuman is worshipped. Later when a descendant of Sonangji when took charge of the lands of his ancestors in their last retreat at Polo, a Koli of Sarvan marked his forehead with blood in token of his unsurrendered title to Samalio's domains. For the next four generations the Idar territories remained unchanged. Then Ranmal, the fifth in descent from Sonangji, took from a Yadav family the country called the Bhagar between Idar and Mewar. Rao during Muslim rule (1300‚Äì1731)During Delhi Sultanate= During this time Muslim power had spread over Gujarat, and Idar had been forced to acknowledge its supremacy. According to one account Muzaffar, one of Alauddin Khalji's general took Idar, and it seems probable that Idar was unable to avoid sharing in the general submission enforced by Alph Khan in the early years of the fourteenth century (1300‚Äì1317). Muhammad bin Tughluq, about forty years later, on entering Gujarat to quell a revolt, first turned his arms against the chiefs of the northeast frontier, and Idar was probably included in the settlement of the province, a work on which he spent the next three years (1347 - 1350). Under the weaker rulers that followed Tughluq, Idar would seem to have been left unmolested. =During Gujarat Sultanate= Near the close of the 13th century, Zafar Khan, afterwards Muzaffar Shah I, founded Gujarat Sultanate. In 1393, the Idar chief refusing to pay his tribute, the governor invested his fort, and after a long siege, forcing the garrison to surrender, extorted a large payment of money and jewels. Five years later (1398) Zafar Khan, determining to reduce Idar, besieged the fort and laid the country waste. While the garrison held out, news came of Timur's victory against Tughlaq dynasty of Delhi, and concluding a peace with Ranmal, Zafar Khan returned to Anhilwad Patan (1401). After three years, according to one account, he again marched to levy the tribute of Idar when the chief fled to Visalnagar leaving Zafar Khan to occupy his capital. If this account is correct the Idar chief must soon after have been restored, for, in the revolt that followed tho death of Muzaffar Shah (1411), two of the rebels, Moiduddin Firoz Khan the cousin, and Masti Khan the uncle of Sultan Ahmed Shah I who founded Ahmedabad, were aided by Ranmal the Idar chief, and took refuge in his fortress. Ahmad Shah I sending troops against the rebels forced them to flee to Nagor, and Rao Ranmal despairing of success made peace with the king by surrendering his horses, elephants, and other war materials (1414). About thirteen years later (1426), Ahmed Shah I again marched against Idar, defeated the force brought to meet him, and drove Rao Punja, the successor of Ranmal, to the hills. Idar was difficult to subdue, for, when his country was threatened, the chief could retire to his hills where he could not easily be followed. As a permanent check on his movements Ahmed Shah I, in 1427, built the fort of Ahmednagar, later known as Himmatnagar, on the banks of the Hathmati river. In the following year (1428) during a frontier foray, Rao Punja, repulsed and pursued by the Muslim cavalry, gallopped towards Idar, and, as he passed along a path at the edge of a ravine, his horse shied, and, falling into the chasm below, killed his rider. After Rao Punja's death, Ahmed Shah I marched on Idar and did not return till Punja's son Narandas had agreed to pay a yearly tribute of ¬£300 (Rs. 3000). Next year Narandas failing to pay his tribute, Ahmed Shah again marched to Idar, and, on 14 November, stormed one of the chief forts in the province, probably Idargadh, and built in it a magnificent mosque. In 1445 Muhammad Shah II, the son and successor of Ahmed Shah, marched against Rao Bhan, the brother and successor of Narandas, who by the Muslims is called Bir or Vir Rai. The Rao appears to have remained quiet during the reign of Mahmud Begada, as, from 1459 to 1513 no mention is made of any expedition against him. Rao Bhan left two sons, Surajmal and Bhim. Surajmal ruled for only eighteen months, leaving a son Raimalji, whose place was, in his minority, usurped by his uncle Bhim. In 1514 Rao Bhim defeated Ain-ul-mulk, governor of Patan, who on his way to Ahmedabad had turned aside to attack the Rao. Advancing with a great army he found Idar abandoned, and destroyed it. At this time Muzaffar Shah II was anxious to advance into Malwa, and, on receiving a large sum of money, made peace with the Rao. Rao Bhim, on his death, was succeeded by his son Bharmal, who soon after was deposed by Rana Sanga of Chittor, whose daughter was married to Raimal the son of Surajmal. In 1515 Bharmal sought the aid of Sultan Muzaffar, and he sending Nizam-ul-mulk, one of his chief officers, replaced Bharmal as ruler of Idar. Raimal did not despair, and two years after again appearing in Idar, defeated a Muhammadan officer Zehr-ul-mulk, the Jher Khan of Hindu tradition. Soon after this Raimal died, and Bharmal became the undisputed chief. But his capital remained in the hands of the Muslims. In 1519 in the presence of Mubariz-ul-mulk, governor of Idar, some one praised the bravery of Rana Sanga of Chittor. Mubariz, to show his contempt, ordered a dog to be tied to the gate of the Idar fort, and to be called Rana Sanga. Hearing of this insult, Rana Sanga marched against Idar. Mubariz having only 900 men retired to Ahmednagar, and Sanga taking Idar and marching against Ahmednagar defeated Mubariz and plundered the town. In the next year (December 1520) Sultan Muzaffar marched on Idar and again took it. During the Muslim occupation of their capital, the Raos are said to have lived at Sarvan, the village held by the descendants of Samalio Sora, formerly in Idar and later in Mewar. The Muslims do not seem to have held Idar for any length of time. Rao Bharmal again occupied his capital and was twice attacked by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat Sultanate in 1528 and in 1530. The second expedition seems to have reduced Rao Bharmal to obedience, as mention is made that in 1530 Bahadur led an army into Bayad and the kings of Idar and Dungarpur were present and served in his camp. Dying in 1543, Bharmal was succeeded by Punjaji. During Punjabi's time the power of the Gujarat Sultanate greatly declined, and, as he is never mentioned, the Idar chief probably left in almost complete independence. Afterwards in the reigns of the last Gujarat Sultanate kings (1540-1572), the Rao of Idar was freed from the demand of tribute on agreeing to serve with 2000 horse. Punjaji was succeeded by his son Narandas, a great ascetic, who lived only on grain that had first been eaten by cows. =During Mughal Empire= Later Ahmedabad fell to Mughal Empire. In 1573, Narandas took part in the revolt against Khan Aziz Koka, the Mughal governor of Gujarat. This revolt was checked by Akbar in person, and, in 1575 and again in 1576, expeditions were sent against Idar. In the last of these the Rao fled, and Idar fell into the Akbar's hands. Following his usual policy, Akbar, asking for no more than an admission of his supremacy, restored the Rao to his state and made him a commander of 2000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Rao Narandas was succeeded by Viramdev, a favourite hero with the bards. Viramdev left no son, and, in supersession of his elder brother Gopaldas, was succeeded by his brother Kalianmal. Going to Delhi, Gopaldas took service with the Emperor in the hope of being helped to regain Idar. At length, advancing at the head of an array, he took possession of Mandva, planning from there an advance on Idar. While at Mandva, Lai Mia, the Muslim landlord of that place, fell on him, and Gopaldas, with fifty-two Rajputs, was slain. When he went to Delhi, Gopaldas left his family at the hamlet of a cowherd named Valo. On growing up Gopaldas' sons made the hamlet their headquarters, calling it Valasna after the cowherd, and gradually encroached on the country round till their lands included the estates of great and little Valasna. At the same time Kalianmal, the ruler of Idar, conquered from Mewar the districts of Panavda, Pahari, Javas, Jora, Pathia, Valecha and others that had been brought under Mewar in the reign of Viramdev. Kalianmal was succeeded by his son Rao Jagannath. During Kalianmal's rule two political parties had been formed, one including the proprietors of Vasai, Mondeti, and Kariadaru supported by tho chiefs of Poshina and Derol; and the other including Garibdas, the Rehvar Thakor of Ranasau, the chief Muslim Kasbatis of Idar, and Motichand Shah, proprietor of Vadali. In these times (about 1650) the Mughal governors of Gujarat began to levy the Idar tribute more regularly than before, and Vetal Bharot of Baroda was the Emperor's security for the Idar chiefs. This security became in time his creditor for so large an amount that the determined to get rid of him, and bringing a charge of fornication against him, drove him out of Idar. Upon this Vetal going to Delhi sought tho Emperor's help, promising to bring Idar into his hands. The Emperor ordered Murad Baksh, then Viceroy of Ahmedabad, (1654‚Äì1657), to help Vetal with 5000 horse. The Rao's agent at the court of Delhi sent word of the threatened danger. But on Vetal's assurance that the rumour was false, the Rao made no preparation. Soon after, Murad Baksh appeared, and, the Rao retiring to Pol, Idar was taken without a blow (1656). Placing a Muslim officer Syed Hatho in command, Prince Murad continued the Idar ministers in the management of affairs. Soon after, in his retreat at Pol, Rao Jagannath died. His son Punja, then a minor, went to Delhi to receive investiture, but failing by the rivalry of the Jaipur king, fled in disguise and joined his mother at Udaipur. Helped by the Rana of Udaipur, Rao Punja, in 1658, won back Idar, where he lived, placing his Ranis and treasure at Sarvan. Poisoned after ruling for about six months, he was succeeded by his brother Arjundas, who while attacking Kanasan was slain by the Rehvars. On Arjundas' death, Rao Jagannath's brother Gopinath began plundering as far as Ahmedabad, and was bought off by Syed Hatho, the Muslim governor, by money payments. Pol Raos still levied from Idar. Syed Hatho was replaced by Kamal Khan, an indolent man whom Rao Gopinath drove out, and, regaining Idar, held it for five years (1664). Garibdas Rehvar, who was at the head of a party in Idar, fearing that Gopinath would take vengeance for Arjundas, brought an army from Ahmedabad to drive him out. The Rao fled to the hills and died for want of opium of which he was accustomed to take a pound and a quarter a day. The affairs of Idar now fell into the hands of Motichand Shah, proprietor of Vadali, and the proprietor of Vasai, Garibdas being the chief minister. In 1679 Karansingh, Gopinath's son, drove out tho Muslim garrison from Idar and regained possession of his capital. Shortly after, Muhammad Amin Khan and Muhammad Bahlol Khan retook Idar, the chief flying to Sarvan where he stayed till his death. Karansingh had two sons, Chando or Chandrasing, and Madhavsing. Madhavsing took possession of Verabar, which his descendants held it until independence of India. For several years Idar remained in the hands of a Muslim garrison commanded by Muhammad Bahlol Khan. In 1696 Chandrasing began to make raids on the Idar territory, and in 1718 the proprietors of Vasai having driven out the Muslim garrison, brought him back to Idar. His soldiers getting clamorous for their pay he gave Sardarsingh of Valasna as security, and entrusting tho government to him retired to Pol. Putting the ruler a Parihar Rajput to death, he seated himself on the royal cushion and founded the present ruling family of Pol. At Idar, after for a time ruling in Chandrasingh's name, Sardarsingh was raised to the chief ship; but afterwards quarrelling with the Kasbatis he had to retire to Valasna. Marwar dynasty rule (1731‚Äì1948) Genealogical tree of Idar State royal family, as of 1900 Bacha Pandit then ruled in Idar till in 1731 he was driven out by Maharajas Anandsinh and Raisinh, brothers of Maharaja Abhai Singh of Jodhpur. Of the succession of the Jodhpur chiefs of the Rathod clan two stories are told; one that they were called in by the Idar ministers; the other that they had been in revolt against their brother, the Maharaja Abhai Singh, Viceroy of Gujarat, and had been pacified by the grant of Idar. In 1734 Jawan Mard Khan, one of the leading Gujarat Muslim nobles, marched on Idar. Anandsingh and Raisingh sought the aid of Malhar Rao Holkar and Ranoji Scindia, who were at this time in Malwa. The Maratha chiefs at once marched to their help, and Jawan Mard Khan, who found himself opposed to an overwhelming army, was forced to agree to pay a sum of ¬£17,500 (Rs. 1,75,000). At tho close of the rainy season of 1738, Momin Khan (1738‚Äì1743) tho Governor of Gujarat came to Idar and levied tribute from the chiefs of Mohanpur and Ranasan. This tribute Anandsingh and Raisingh claimed as being within tho limits of their own territory. But tho dispute was amicably settled, Raisingh, at Momin Khan's request, remaining with him, and Momin Khan agreeing to pay his men's expenses. In 1741 Rangoji, the Maratha chief, induced Raisingh to leave Momin Khan and join his service, but Momin soon detached Raisingh from this alliance by conferring on him the districts of Modasa, Kankrej, Ahmednagar, Prantij, and Harsol. Next year (1742) the Itehvar Rajputs attacked and took Idar killing the chief Raja Anandsingh. On hearing of this, his brother Raisingh, taking leave from Momin Khan, went to Idar, attacked and drove out the Rehvars, and placing Anandsingh's son, Shivsingh, a boy of six years on the throne, himself acted as minister. Raisingh died in 1750 or 1751 or 1765. During the Maratha and Mughal struggles which ended in the Maratha capture of Ahmedabad in 1757, Shivsing would seem to have sided with tho Mughals, and to have been, as a punishment, forced to give up Prantij, Bijapur, and his halves of Modasa, Bayad, and Harsol. About the year 1766 the Gaekwad army under Appa Saheb came to Idar and demanded from Shivsingh half of the territory of Idar as belonging to his uncle Raisingh who had died without heir. Shivsingh tried to avoid compliance, but was in the end compelled to write over a half share of the revenues of tho state. In 1778 the Peshwa's deputy at Ahmedabad, with the help of the brother of Surajmal, one of the Idar proprietors who had been put to death by the eldest son of Shivsingh, levied a tax in the Idar districts named ghanim ghoda vero or the robbers' cess. Thirteen years later Shivsingh died (1791) leaving five sons, Bhavanisingh, Sagramsingh, Zalimsingh, Amirsingh, and Indrasingh. His eldest son Bhavanising succeeded him, but dying after twelve days was succeeded by his son Gambhirsingh, then thirteen years old. Shortly after Gambhirsing's accession his uncles conspired to murder him, but the plot was found out and they were ordered to leave Idar. Sagramsingh retired to Ahmednagar, and Zalimsingh and Amirsingh for whom no provision had been made by their father took possession of the Bayad and Modasa sub-divisions. In 1795 the three brothers made a joint foray into the Idar districts, and Gambhirsingh, meeting them and being worsted, had to enter into agreements very disadvantageous to him. The brothers were allowed to keep not only tho two sub-divisions they had seized, but several other tracts including Davar, Arora, Viravada, Senol, Gabat, and the Sabarkantha tribute. These lands were taken possession of by Zalimsingh, on who so death his childless widow adopted a younger son of the Ahmednagar family. In 1801 the Koli chiefs of Gadvada were attacked and defeated by a Muslim force from Palanpur State. The chiefs applied to Gambhirsingh, but he was unable to give them any help. Next year the Gaekwad's revenue-collecting force came from Kathiawar, and encamping at Siddhpur, summoned Gambhirsingh to pay tribute arrears. Whilst at Siddhpur Gambhirsingh, by the promise of an increase in the tribute, induced the commander of the Gaekwad's force to help him in driving out the Muslims from Gadhvada. After some difficulty the tribute was settled at tho sum of ¬£2400 (Rs. 24,000), and its name changed from tho robber-horse, ghanam ghoda, to the grass and grain, ghas‚Äìdana, cess. The Koli chiefs on their restoration to Gadhvada wrote over a third share of their revenues in Idar's favour. In 1804 the Thakor of Ghadhvada, a Rehvar chief, was murdered by his brother. Gambhirsingh helped the Thakor's son to avenge his father's death, and two-fifths of the produce of Ghadhvada were written over to Idar and afterwards assigned to Indrasingh. Gambhirsingh, in 1808, attacked Virahar, a cadet of the Pol family, also Temba a Koli village, and the villages of Navargam and Berna belonging to the Rana of Danta, from all of which he compelled the payment of tribute, khichdi. Rao Ratansingh of Pol was also obliged to enter into a similar security. Next year Gambhirsingh again sallied out and collected tribute from the Koli villages of Karcha, Samera, Dehgamri, Vangar, Vandeol, and Khuski, the last a Rajput possession. He subsequently spread his levies over the Rehvar estates of Sirdoi, Mohanpur, Ranasan, and Rupal. In 1823, Amirsingh of Bayad died leaving two daughters. Both Idar and Ahmednagar laid claim to his estates. In 1827 by the help of British Lieutenant-Colonel Ballantyne, an agreement was framed, by which Idar renounced all claim to Modasa and received two-thirds of Bayad, the remaining third going to Ahmednagar. This agreement was never carried out. One of the daughters died, and later Amirsingh's widow wrote over the estate to Gambhirsingh on condition of his effecting the marriage of her surviving daughter. The terms were not fulfilled and the daughter fled to Ahmednagar, in who so favour a precisely similar document had been executed by the mother. The daughter declined matrimony and with the help of the Ahmednagar chief continued to manage her estate. Gambhirsingh died in the midst of these discussions (1833) and the matter dropped. A few months before his death, Gambhirsing took advantage of British agent Erskine's being at Idar to make over his son to the care of the British Government. And a few years later (1837) the continued mismanagement of the Idar state and the helpless condition of the young prince induced the queen to demand help of the British Government. British Government agreed and shortly after, the Modasa and Bayad disputes were re-opened and referred by the Rani to Captain Outram. Meanwhile, the death of the Maharaja of Jodhpur, and the adoption of Takhtsing of Ahmednagar, put a stop to any further proceedings, as the Idar house claimed as the head of the family the whole of the Ahmednagar possessions. This claim the Maharaja of Jodhpur attempted to set aside. But it was finally decided by the Government of India on 14 April 1848, that Ahmednagar and its dependencies should revert to the elder or Idar branch, and that the two estates should, as they had before 1784, form one state under the Raja of Idar. It became part of Mahi Kantha Agency. Of Gambhirsingh's two sons Umedsingh and Javansingh, the first died in his father's lifetime. Ghambhirsing was succeeded by Javansing. In 1861 Javansing entered into an agreement binding himself to prevent the smuggling of salt through his territory. Later he gained seat in Bombay Legislative Council and the reign was, in 1868, cut short by his death at the early age of thirty-eight. He was succeeded by his son Keshrisingh, during whose minority the affairs of the state are managed by the British Political Agent. Kesrisingh ruled until his death in 1901.

Daulat Singh succeeded Pratap Singh and ruled till 14 April 1931. Followed by Himmat Singh, who renamed Ahmednagar as Himmatnagar ruled until Independence of India on 15 August 1947.

Himatnagar became capital of Sabarkantha district eclipsing Idar. Idar continued as taluka (subdivision) of Sabarkantha district. Idar expanded significantly when some villages were relocated to Idar for construction of Dharoi Dam. Later when Aravalli district carved out of Sabarkantha in 2013, Modasa became capital of new district.

During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he took an internationalist and pacifist position. After the war he tried to establish a radical Communist party that blended Bolshevism with anarchist concepts. Early years Raymond Louis P√©ricat was born on 23 January 1873 in Gretz- Armainvilliers, Seine-et-Marne. He entered the building trade, and soon became involved in union activities. He was secretary of the Building Federation (F√©d√©ration du B√¢timent) from 1908 to 1912. P√©ricat represented the Federation of Building Trades Workers at the CGT's Conf√©rence Ordinaire des F√©d√©rations Nationales et des Bourses du Travail held on 13‚Äì15 July 1913. This was the last general meeting of the CGT before World War I (1914‚Äì18). P√©ricat was in favor of fusing the national federations and bourses, while L√©on Jouhaux and Alphonse Merrheim were in favor of keeping a degree of autonomy. World War I During World War I (28 July 1914 ‚Äì 11 November 1918) P√©ricat devoted much effort to fighting the nationalist unions that supported the war, along with Merrheim, Albert Bourderon and Fernand Loriot. On 31 July 1914 he was the only member of the National Confederal Committee of the CGT to propose to implement the decision made by its congress and launch an insurrection against the war. The International Action Committee (CAI: Comit√© d'action internationale) was founded in December 1915 by French syndicalists who supported the pacifist declarations of the Zimmerwald Conference. P√©ricat was secretary of the CAI. In 1916 the CAI merged with the Socialist Minority Committee to form the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations (Comit√© pour la r√©prise des r√©lations internationales). P√©ricat was a member of the executive of this committee. Albert Bourderon proposed and Louise Saumoneau supported a manifesto that said the Committee would function \\"until the party majority and the International Socialist Bureau resume international relations.\\" In February 1917 the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations split up. Alphonse Merrheim withdrew to concentrate on union work. Pierre Brizon, Jean Raffin-Dugens and Bourderon joining the SFIO minority led by Jean Longuet. The socialists Fernand Loriot, Charles Rappoport, Louise Saumoneau and Fran√ßois Mayoux took control of the committee. P√©ricat disagreed with the committee's direction and founded a Committee of Syndicalist Defense (Comit√© de d√©fense syndicaliste) early in 1917 to campaign for a general strike and demand an immediate peace. When a series of strikes began in the spring of 1918 in the Loire Basin, centered on Saint-√âtienne, Pericat and Andr√©e Andrieux tried to convert the strikes into a general strike against the war along the same lines as the Bolshevik actions in Russia. The strikes were suppressed and the leaders of the Committee of Syndicalist Defense were arrested. Merrheim had disagreed with the strikes, but defended P√©ricat and told the premier Georges Clemenceau and the Left deputies that they must listen to the proletariat and understand their grievances if France was to avoid the fate of Russia in being forced into peace on disadvantageous terms. P√©ricat was released in November 1918. Later career P√©ricat's position after the war has been called \\"Ultra-Left\\", a blend of Bolshevism with syndicalist anarchism. He founded and became editor of the newspaper L'Internationale. In the first edition, published on 15 February 1919, he disparaged the Second International and called for a true International to be established. On 8 May 1919 the Committee for Resumption, the Committee of Syndicalist Defense and other anarchist elements decided to combine into the Committee for the Third International (Comit√© pour la 3e Internationale.) The secretaries of the committee were Alfred Rosmer, P√©ricat, Loriot and Saumoneau, all Anarcho-Syndicalists. They decided not to break with the CGT, but to spread propaganda for the new International. Pericat disagreed with this approach, wanting to form a Communist Party. P√©ricat accused the committee of being unrevolutionary, and even of taking a parliamentary approach. He wanted to expand the strikes that broke out in the spring of 1919 into a full-scale revolution. P√©ricat founded a new party, officially the Parti Communiste, Section Fran√ßaise de l'Internationale, which published a manifesto and by-laws at the start of June 1919. It called for a general strike to overthrow the state. The civil service and the state itself were to be abolished, replaced by a system of corporations, or soviets, administering themselves with a confederation. On 1 September 1919 Leon Trotsky chose to ignore P√©ricat's dispute with the mainstream French Communists and wrote a letter to Pierre Monatte, Loriot, P√©ricat and Alfred Rosmer in which he talked of his \\"bonds of friendship\\" with them all, and said the revolution in France would be in strong hands. In October 1919 Lenin wrote in an article that Pericat's L'Internationale and Georges Anquetil's Titre Censur√© were the two Communist newspapers in Paris. He did not mention La Vie Ouvri√®re. At the CGT's first post-war congress, held in Lyon on 15‚Äì21 September 1919, Monatte, P√©ricat, Gaston Monmousseau and Joseph Tommasi led the minority that wanted to bring the CGT into the Third International, seize power and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. They led a committee of 26 minority unions that was formed in October 1919, later named the Comit√© Syndicaliste R√©volutionnaire (CST). L'Internationale was forced to stop publication in September 1919. In late December 1919 P√©ricat's group, harassed by the government and the press, split into a Parti Communiste and a F√©d√©ration Communiste des Soviets. In 1920 the anarchist militants in these two groups became disillusioned with the Bolsheviks, and in 1921 and 1922 became extremely hostile opponents of the Communist Party. Raymond P√©ricat died in Paris on 13 July 1958 at the age of 85.

Organized in 1889 by George W. Hinckley, the membership-driven organization is dedicated to providing assistance to indigent and troubled families. It has a campus of more than in Fairfield, on which it operates the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences, a boarding and day school focused on agricultural and outdoor education, and the Glenn Stratton Learning Center, a day treatment school focused on children with social, emotional, and behavioral challenges. It is also home to the L. C. Bates Museum, one of the oldest natural history museums in Maine. History The Good Will-Hinckley Home Association was organized in 1889 by George Walter Hinckley, a native of Guilford, Connecticut who trained both for the ministry and as a teacher. As a young man he was impressed by the changes effected in under-privileged and troubled youth when given a suitably nurturing environment, and to this end he established a home on a farm in the northeastern part of Fairfield, Maine, a rural community in southern Somerset. Hinckley traveled widely to raise funds for the Good Will School, and had by his death in 1950 grown the campus to and 45 buildings, and served more than 3,000 underprivileged and troubled youth. Sometime thereafter the organization, then operating as the Hinckley School, began marketing itself as a college preparatory school, similar to Phillips Exeter Academy and Tabor Academy. The Maine Attorney General sued the organization, which in 1970 was found to be operating outside its chartered purpose, and was given three years to return to that purpose. This was addressed in part by enlarging the organization's charter to include a broader range of educational activities. The school closed its doors in 2009 after state funding for boarding facilities of the sort it provided were reallocated to home-based treatments for at-risk youth, leaving only a day program. The subsequent reorganization consumed part of the organization's endowment and forced the sale of of its campus. Organization Good Will-Hinckley is the operating name of the Good Will Home Association, a nonprofit member-driven organization dedicated to propagating Hinckley's legacy. The organization operates three major programs from its campus (now just ): The Maine Academy of Natural Sciences, a secondary charter school for students who do not thrive in traditional academic settings, the Glenn Stratton Learning Center, a day treatment center for troubled children, and the L. C. Bates Museum of natural history. The organization provides on-campus housing for students who live too far away, and for those who require an alternative home environment. Campus Good Will-Hinckley's campus is located in northeastern Fairfield, on the west side of United States Route 201, on either side of Martin Stream, with what was historically the girls campus on the north side and the boys campus on the south side. The historic core of the campus, some that include all of its buildings built between 1889 and 1930, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The campus includes a number of architect-designed residence cottages, spread out along Page Terrace, along with several other architecturally distinguished buildings. The 1897 Moody Chapel was designed by Wilfred E. Mansur of Bangor, Moody Hall (1905‚Äì06) was designed by William R. Miller of Lewiston, and the Prescott Administration building (1916) was designed by New York City architect Edward Josselyn. New York architect Albert Randolph Ross designed by 1906-07 Carnegie Library, built with funding support from Andrew Carnegie. Josselyn also designed the 1919 woodworking shop, and Miller was responsible for the Romanesque Revival building housing the L. C. Bates Museum.

Stanley on August 23, 1954 to study the effects of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education issued on May 17, 1954 and May 31, 1955, and to make recommendations.E. Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia 1939-1960 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1961) p. 311 Its counsel were David J. Mays (until December 1957) and his associate Henry T. Wickham.James Sweeney (ed.), Race, Reason and Massive Resistance: the Diaries of David J. Mays (University of Georgia Press 2008)  Background  Even before establishing the commission, Stanley had announced his opposition to the Brown decision. Stanley was allied with U.S. Senator, Harry F. Byrd, head of the Byrd Organization that had long dominated politics in the state, and who as time passed would become more and more staunchly against racial integration, which he rationalized on anti-miscegenation grounds. The day after Brown I, Stanley had called for \\"cool heads, calm study, and sound judgment\\" and said he would write to Byrd, who at first was neither defiant nor conciliatory. But within days, the governor's office was deluged with letters expressing fears about communist plots (this being the McCarthy era and early Cold War) and race mixing. Stanley assured those citizens that schools would remain segregated for the 1954‚Äì1955 school year.Ronald Heinemann, Harry Byrd of Virginia (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1996, p. 325-326 On June 20, 1954, twenty legislators from Southside Virginia met in a Petersburg firehouse, called together by state Senator Garland Gray (in whose district the firehouse lay) and declared themselves \\"unalterably opposed\\" to racial integration in the schools. They included U.S. Congressmen Watkins Abbitt and Bill Tuck, as well as state senators Gray, Mills Godwin and Albertis Harrison. Four days later many fourth District citizens descended onto the state capitol. On June 25, 1954, after meeting with other Southern governors in Richmond (and learning about the Petersburg firehouse meeting, but about two months before announcing this commission's membership), Stanley had vowed, \\"I shall use every legal means at my command to continue segregated schools in Virginia\\". Section 140 of the State Constitution had specifically provided for racial segregation in public schools. Stanley now proposed repealing Section 129 of the State Constitution, which required the state provide free public schools.Heinemann p. 327 Radical segregationists proposed to close public schools to avoid integration, which upset other Virginians. Because all 32 of Governor Stanley's appointees on August 30, 1954 were legislators (13 senators and 19 delegates), all were male Caucasians. The Virginia Council of Churches had urged Stanley to appoint commissioners of both races, but he announced that a legislative commission would be better because legislators would have to consider and act upon its proposals.Sweeney p. 28. Republican Ted Dalton had also called for a nonpartisan biracial commission to work out a desegregation program for Virginia. State superintendent of public instruction Dowell Howard expressed his hope that the problem could be solved gradually.Heinemann p. 326 Stanley's appointees were weighted towards those districts with the largest black communities by percentage, which thus would be most affected by the Supreme Court's rulings. Thus, the 4th and 5th U.S. Congressional districts (Abbitt's and Tuck's) accounted for ten members and the 1st U.S. Congressional district (then represented by ex-football coach Edward J. Robeson Jr.) had five members. All three of those districts were Byrd Organization stronghold and had many counties with more black than white residents, although poll taxes, Jim Crow laws and other tactic restricted blacks' voting power (sometimes those southern and eastern Virginia counties were referred to as \\"Black Belt\\"). By that autumn white leaders in those affected communities had formed the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties, which would radicalize their response.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/massive_resistance#start_entry The commission's first meeting was held on September 13, 1954; members elected Gray chairman. Gray then selected an eleven-member executive committee. The full commission decided that all its sessions, as well as those of the executive committee would be closed to the public, although it could hold public hearings.Sweeney p. 28  Members of the Commission  *Garland Gray of Waverly (6th Senatorial District), Chairman *Harry B.

That eleven hour session occurred after the elections, on November 14, 1954 in Richmond, and included testimony from over a hundred persons.Sweeney p. 28 citing Gates, Making of Massive Resistance pp. 31-41. The Commission then issued a preliminary report in January 1955, as the next legislative session began, noting popular opposition to integration and pledging to design a program to prevent enforced integration in Virginia's public schools.Sweeney p. 29 citing Gates, Making of Massive Resistance pp. 44-46. Basically, it proceeded from an assumption that Brown was both bad law and bad social policy.http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/civilrightstv/glossary/topic-009.html Brown II, in which the Supreme Court told school districts to desegregate public schools \\"with all deliberate speed\\" was issued on May 31, 1955. Six months later the Gray Commission issued its 18-page final report, on November 11, 1955,http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/civilrightstv/documents/images/commissionreportonpubliceducation.pdf four days after the Virginia Supreme Court in Almond v. Day (which concerned other vouchers) held that Section 141 of the state Constitution barred appropriating public funds to support private schools. The commission's final suggestions included, but were not limited to: * Amending the state compulsory attendance law so no white parent need send his or her child to an integrated school * Pupil placements boards with a local option so that a school board could assign pupils to various public schools, based on factors including availability of facilities and transportation, health, the child's aptitude and the welfare and best interests of other pupils attending that schoolPratt p.5 * A tuition grant program for parents who wished to send their children to private academies rather than an integrated school  Criticism and aftermath  Even Gray withdrew support because the plan Mays drafted included a local option. Many segregationists wanted any public school allowing segregation to be closed. On November 14, 1955, Governor Stanley called an extra session of the Virginia General Assembly which began on November 30, 1955 and adjourned on December 3, 1955. Virginia's voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional convention on January 9, 1956 (necessary to amend the constitution to allow private school vouchers), but little legislation was passed in the regular legislative session which began two days later and ended on March 12. Meanwhile, on March 6, 1956 the constitutional convention approved a tuition voucher amendment. The Gray Commission met again in May 1956, but made no additional recommendations. Both segregationists and moderates had come to oppose the original Gray Commission plan, especially after extensive press criticism led by James J. Kilpatrick and after federal judges in July 1956 ordered integration of schools in Norfolk, Arlington and Charlottesville. Meanwhile, the Gray Commission's executive committee met, and with the assistance of then-attorney general J. Lindsay Almond Jr. crafted the more radical Stanley Plan. An initial draft of July 25, 1956 failed to receive the full commission's approval the following day. However, the commission passed a redrafted version by a 19‚Äì12 vote on August 22. Governor Stanley had called a special legislative session, which began meeting on August 27. It ultimately passed the Stanley Plan. However, that defiance produced more litigation, and the existing desegregation lawsuits dragged on. On March 26, 1957, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld lower court orders for desegregation of Arlington and Charlottesville schools, but gave segregationists some hope by denying certiorari a case which denied black children admission to a school in Old Fort, North Carolina using a pupil placement system (and without the school closure provisions of the Stanley Plan). That spring, the NAACP also challenged various aspects of the new Virginia plan which were directed against it and similar to new legislation in other southern states. Those reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1958 as Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities and Harrison v. NAACP. Meanwhile, Almond brought a \\"friendly\\" lawsuit against comptroller Sidney C. Day, seeking the Virginia judiciary's approval of the school voucher plan after the constitutional changes (after he was elected Governor in 1957, his successor as Attorney General, former Gray Commission member Albertis Harrison was substituted in the legal proceeding captions). On January 19, 1959, both the Virginia Supreme Court in Harrison v. Day and a three judge federal panel in James v. Almond found the Stanley Plan unconstitutional.

Binta Masi Garba always advocated for women rights; thus prompting her to take up the mandate to represent them in the Federal House of representative Kaduna South Federal Constituency. Not long from that gender inequality experience, she decides to venture into politics in 1998 in Kaduna South Federal Constituency, a place where the prevailing culture forbid women to be in public domain. Her first bid in 1998 was not successful. she contested again in 1999 for the office of Federal House of Representatives and won with 5,000 votes. She was the youngest Federal legislator in Nigeria in 1999. After her first successful tenure, she contested again in 2003 and won against her opponent with a margin of not less than 50,000. In 2006, close to the end of her second term in the Federal House of Representatives, the then Governor of Adamawa State, Boni Haruna, having heard of her excellent performance as a legislator representing Kaduna South, entreated her to come back to her State of origin, Adamawa State, and contest. After making consultations, she consented and came down to contest for House of Representatives in Madagali/Michika Federal Constituency under PDP. She eventually won the seat and represented the constituency from 2007 to 2011.

McBryde is credited with training \\"at least three generations of Australian archaeologists\\" and is affectionately referred to as the \\"Mother of Australian Archaeology\\". McBryde had a \\"holistic\\" approach to studying the archaeology of Aboriginal Australia, which has been carried on by many of her students (and her student's students). McBryde has also made considerable contributions to the preservation and protection of Australian cultural heritage, particularly Aboriginal cultural heritage.  Biography  McBryde was born in Fremantle, Western Australia on 16 July 1934. Her family moved to Melbourne not long after her birth. McBryde completed honours and master's degrees, in Latin and history, at the University of Melbourne. She received her formal archaeological training at Cambridge University where she undertook a Diploma in Prehistoric Archaeology in 1959. In 1960, McBryde returned to Australia and was appointed as the first lecturer in prehistory and ancient history at the University of New England (UNE), the first titled position of its kind in Australia. She completed her PhD at UNE in 1966 with a regional study of the Aboriginal archaeology of the New England region of New South Wales. According to Sandra Bowdler and Genevieve Clune, her PhD was the first-ever awarded based on Australian archaeological fieldwork. At UNE, McBryde set up courses in archaeology, focusing on the \\"importance of regionally focused archaeology.\\" McBryde was appointed as senior lecturer in the Department of Prehistory and Anthropology at the ANU in 1974, and in 1986 she was appointed as the chair of prehistory. McBryde retired from ANU in 1994.  Awards and Honours  McBryde was elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1979. In 1990, McBryde became an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for her \\"service to education, particularly in the field of Australian Prehistory\\". In 2001, McBryde received a further honour from the Australian Government, being awarded a Centenary Medal \\"for service to cultural heritage and as a distinguished archaeologist\\". McBryde remained continually involved within the world of archaeological academia with great enthusiasm, as she routinely reviewed fellow archaeological work. In 2003, McBryde was awarded the Rhys Jones Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Australian Archaeology, which is the highest honour bestowed by the Australian Archaeological Association. In the citation for her medal it was noted that: \\"Few people have created such an enduring legacy for Australian archaeology. She has touched the minds, hearts and actions of virtually the entire Australian archaeological community. She is celebrated by students, Indigenous communities, colleagues and friends.\\" In 2005, McBryde was awarded life membership for Outstanding Contribution to the Australian Archaeological Association, an association of which she was a founding member, and also served as its first secretary in 1974‚Äì1975. Her work is described and lauded in Billy Griffiths' 2018 award-winning book Deep Time Dreaming: Uncovering Ancient Australia.

He is the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation. Biography Jay Ruderman was born in Boston to Marcia and Morton E. Ruderman, the eldest of three children. Ruderman's father was a founder of Meditech.Morton Ruderman devoted life to helping others, Boston Globe Ruderman attended public schools in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, and received his undergraduate degree in 1988 from Brandeis University, where he served as president of the student body in 1986‚Äì1987. He earned his JD from Boston University School of Law in 1993. Ruderman is married to Israeli-American Shira Menashe Ruderman, who serves as executive director of the Ruderman Foundation.50 Most Influential Jews: Jay and Shira RudermanRuderman met Shira while living in Israel and attending an ulpan where she was teaching.Small family foundation, large global impact Ruderman lives in the Greater Boston area and has four children. Legal and philanthropic career Ruderman began his career as Assistant District Attorney in Salem, MA and also worked as Deputy Director of AIPAC before enlisting in the Israeli Defense Forces. He then went back to AIPAC as Leadership Director in Israel before assuming a position at the Ruderman Family Foundation. In addition, Ruderman served on the board of directors of the National Organizationon Disability. He sits on the board of governors of the University of Haifa, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and is a member of the Gann Academy's Board of Trustees. Ruderman says the Ruderman Foundation's first major investment was in Jewish day schools, to ensure the inclusion of children with disabilities.How the Rudermans helped bring disability awareness to the Oscars  Disabled rights activism In November 2015, Ruderman criticized Donald Trump for mimicking the disability of New York Times writer Serge Kovaleski, who suffers from a congenital condition that affects joint movement. Ruderman released two white papers focusing on television content and people with disabilities, as well as a white paper on first responders and suicide. In 2019 Jay Ruderman enacted a scholarship for students with disabilities at Yale School of Drama with the goal of increasing authentic representation for disabilities in Hollywood.https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/disabled-actors-say- theyre-the-last-civil-rights-movement-in-hollywood-hardly-anyones-discussing- it/2019/01/24/cbde57a2-1817-11e9-9ebf-c5fed1b7a081_story.html Since then, Ruderman has also focused on increasing authentic representation in the entertainment industry. Despite recent improvements in authentic casting in 2020, Ruderman has emphasized that the low representation on screen had implications in shaping attitudes towards people with disabilities. Ruderman works with actors, disability activists and celebrities to spread awareness of disability inclusion in the entertainment industry. Some of them serve on the Ruderman Family Foundation's International Advisory Council. Ruderman partnered with Variety Magazine for Variety's 2019 Inclusion Summit, where panelists discussed disability inclusion in entertainment. Ruderman and his wife have also been credited with helping to bring disability inclusion to the Oscars. In 2020, Zack Gottsagen, an actor who has Down syndrome, presented an award with actor Shia LaBeouf. In February 2019, Ruderman collaborated with a disabled rights group, LINK20, in an appeal to rename Major League Baseball's \\"disabled list,\\" the 'injured list.' In May 2019, Ruderman announced that his foundation would award a Seal of Authentic Representation to television or feature film projects featuring actors with disabilities in substantial acting roles. At the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, Ruderman pushed to improve accessibility and the inclusion of people with disabilities and diversity. In March 2020, Ruderman organized an event in which Peter and Bobby Farrelly were awarded the Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion for hiring actors with disabilities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ruderman expressed concern about the effects on the mental health of first responders and healthcare workers. He also announced grants to workers at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Boston Police Foundation to support their mental health.  U.S.-Israel relations  Ruderman is actively involved in fostering understanding between American Jewry and Israel. He was among several signatories of an ad expressing disappointment over the stance of the Israeli government on egalitarian prayer at the Western Wall. Ruderman was also critical of the comment of Israel's Minister of Education regarding the high rate of intermarriage among American Jews. Ruderman was quoted as saying the \\"doomsday talks of an irreversible chasm between Israel and the American Jewish community were mistaken,\\" in light of a recent Ruderman Family Foundation survey and in response to the notion that the bond between U.S. Jews and Israel is weakening. Views and opinions Ruderman was critical of the movie Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot for casting Joaquin Phoenix in the role of a disabled man instead of an actor with a disability.\\"Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Worry, He Won‚Äôt Get Far on Foot‚Äô Casting Slammed as Offensive by Ruderman Disability Foundation\\" IndieWire. Retrieved 2018-03-22. In July 2017, he similarly condemned the movie Blind starring Alec Baldwin and Demi Moore on grounds that Baldwin played a blind character. In his view the movie was \\"just the latest example of treating disability as a costume.\\" He likened the casting of able-bodied actors to portray characters with disabilities to blackface and states that it's time for society to condemn the practice just like casting white actors to play black characters is no longer socially acceptable. The incident led to written exchanges between the movie's director, Michael Mailer, and Ruderman, both published by the industry publication Deadline.com. Ruderman also criticized Me Before You for its portrayal of disability: The protagonistwho is paralyzedends up committing suicide because he feels his life is not worth living. Ruderman stated: \\"To the millions of people with significant disabilities currently leading fulfilling, rich lives, it posits that they are better off committing suicide.\\" Ruderman's second major point in this controversy was that it is problematic for an able-bodied actor to play a character with a disability, a topic he often speaks up about.

Its name, meaning anchor in English, comes from an older neighboring building.  Historic build-up area  On the site of the department store stood the Romanesque church of St. Benedict. Before the mid-13th century, there was a commandry of Prague Teutonic Knights which had a fortress character and was related to current fortifications built in the Old Town. Strahov premonstratensians in the 17th century established a campus Norbertinum here and a baroque church was rebuilt according to plans by Domenico Orsi, newly consecrated as St. Norbert. The church was demolished in the late 18th century due to the construction of the New Town noblewomen Institute. During the construction of the department store, valuable houses from the 19th and 20th century were demolished. Due to time pressure during construction, significant archeologic areas were lost.  Construction  The Kotva department store was created between 1970 and 1975, designed by Czech architect couple Vƒõra Machoninov√° and Vladimir Machonin. It was built by the Swedish construction company SIAB, which was at that time very unusual. The floor plan consists of multiple intertwined hexagons. Kotva has five stories above ground, a total of ten interconnected escalators (two shafts of five escalators) and about the same number underground, serving as a garage and supermarket. It was intended to become a symbol of abundance and wealth in socialism. At the time of construction it was the largest department store in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Kotva did not avoid supply problems, which showed the weakness of the country's economy. Until the 1990s, the store offered a diverse range of products, today its focus is on clothing and fashion goods.  Monument declaration  In 2007, architectural historian Rostislav ≈†v√°cha suggested the Ministry of Culture declare the building a cultural monument because it represents a highpoint in Czech architecture of the first half of the 1970s and its visual and structural concept is peculiarly dealing with the suggestions of several directions in the post-war world of architecture. A similar architectural character began to be used before the Second World War by Frank Lloyd Wright.Jana Nov√°kov√°: Stane se Kotva pam√°tkou?, Lidovky.cz, 15. 2. 2007 This request failed. Since April 2019, Kotva Department Store is a Czech cultural monument. A new request from 2016 was success.

He is also the founder of Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation, a not for profit organisation working in tandem with government and non government bodies for spreading awareness about breast cancer and Pink Connexion, the first newsletter from India, a quarterly, about breast healthcare. The Government of India honoured him in 2015 with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. In 2017, the Medical council of India selected him for the prestigious Dr B C Roy National award for ‚ÄòOutstanding service in the field of Socio Medical Relief‚Äô for the year 2016. Biography Raghu Ram Pillarisetti was born on 22 September 1966 in Guntur in the undivided Andhra Pradesh in India to medical doctor parents, P. V. Chalapathi Rao and Ushalakshmi Kumari, a breast cancer survivor. He graduated in medicine (MBBS) Siddhartha Medical College, secured a master's degree in surgery (MS) obtaining first place from Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore in 1995. He then went to UK and obtained FRCS in 1997 from all the four Surgical Royal Colleges in the British Isles (Edinburgh, London, Glasgow & Ireland). He subsequently completed Higher Surgical Training & subspecialty training in oncoplastic breast surgery at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in London and at the Nottingham Breast Institute. In 2002, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. He relocated to India in 2007 and established a dedicated purpose built facility for breast health care at KIMS Hospitals in Hyderabad. The Centre, KIMS-USHALAKSHMI Centre for Breast Diseases, bears his mother‚Äôs name (Ushalakshmi). Raghu Ram, over the course of time, founded Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation for spreading awareness about the disease and, later, started publishing Pink Connexion, a quarterly newsletter to aid his awareness campaigns. Under the auspices of Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation, he championed a number of unique and innovative initiatives in India to transform breast cancer from a ‚Äòtaboo‚Äô issue to a much commonly discussed one, thus creating the much needed awareness about importance of early detection. Since 2007, he has spearheaded the annual ‚ÄúPink Ribbon Campaign‚Äù, which is a benchmark breast cancer awareness activity in Hyderabad‚Äôs calendar during the month of October (international breast cancer awareness month). Between 2012 ‚Äì 2016, he has overseen the implementation of south Asia‚Äôs largest population based breast cancer screening programme in the southern Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation in partnership with the Governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh screened 200, 000 underprivileged women spread across 4000 villages for early signs of breast cancer by way of Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) performed by over 3000 healthcare workers. Women diagnosed with breast cancer were treated free of cost under the State Government‚Äôs Arogyasree scheme. In 2016, the Government of India invited him to be part of the Steering Committee and a high powered Technical Advisory Group (TAG) set up by the Union Ministry of Health, which has drafted guidelines to replicate the Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) based breast cancer screening programme across the nation.

Clarembald was a native of Normandy before he became prior of the Cluniac house Montacute Priory in 1155.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 122 Around 1158 he became prior of Thetford Priory, which he held until 1163.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 125 Clarembald was appointed to St Augustine's in 1163,Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 36 at the command of King Henry II of England.Greatrex \\"Clarembald\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After his appointment, he refused to make a profession of obedience to Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury,Barlow Thomas Becket p. 96 claiming that the abbey was exempt from oversight by the archbishop and that swearing obedience would compromise the abbey's independence. Pope Alexander III ordered Clarembald to swear to obey Becket on 10 July 1165, but offered two small concessions ‚Äì one that the form should be in the same form that previous abbots had sworn and secondly that the oath would not preclude further legal actions on whether the profession was required.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 138 Clarembald, who was supported in his defiance of the archbishop by the king, continued to refuse to swear to obey Becket and was never consecrated as abbot. He remained as abbot-elect for his entire time in office. In late 1167 Clarembald was a member of a royal deputation to the papacy, along with Reginald fitzJocelin, Simon de Prisun, and Henry of Northampton. The envoys were part of diplomatic efforts on behalf of the king as part of the Becket controversy between the king and Becket.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 175 In 1168 the monks of St Augustine's complained to the papacy that Clarembald was allowing infants and small children to become monks of their abbey. The monks were given a papal ruling that stated no one should be allowed to become a monk younger than age 15.Knowles Monastic Order p. 421 The next year Clarembald was the sole supporter of a royal effort to remove England from papal and archiepiscopal authority. Clarembald was appointed to conduct the sheriff's inquest of 1170 in Kent and other southern counties. On 29 December 1170, Clarembald was host to the four knights, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy, and Richard le Breton, who were on their way to confront Becket. The knights asked Clarembald's advice, and the abbot-elect sent a knight of the abbey, Simon de Criol, along with the other four to confront the archbishop,Barlow Thomas Becket p. 238 which led to the murder of the archbishop later that day.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 246‚Äì248 The monks of St Augustine's had long complained that their abbot was incompetent, stole revenues meant for the monks, sold property belonging to the abbey for his own use, and accepted bribes. The dispute between Becket and the king appears to have delayed the papacy noticing the dire straits the abbey had fallen into, but after Becket's death in 1173 the situation finally resulted in papal action. Clarembald was deposed from his abbacy in 1173, by a papal commission composed of Bartholomew Iscanus the Bishop of Exeter, Roger the Bishop of Worcester, and the abbot of Faversham. The judgement of deposition was seen by the judges as not just a punishment for Clarembald's offences against his monks, but also as a punishment for his involvement in the murder of Becket.Cheney Roger, Bishop of Worcester pp. 134‚Äì135 Clarembald had fled the abbey before the commission arrived, and his later career is unknown. Clarembald probably died on 18 March, when his obituary was remembered at St. Augustine's, but the year is not known.

He was born at home in a humble house in Roubaix, an industrial city where his mother was a housekeeper and his father a textile worker. A Republican under the Second Empire and a syndicalist, Jean-Hippolyte Lebas was a socialist who had become member of the Parti Ouvrier Fran√ßais (POF) at its foundation in 1880. Altogether, it was observable that Jean- Baptiste Lebas had been brought up in a working class family and steeped in a left-wing milieu in his birth town. In 1896, following his father at the age of eighteen, he joined the POF.

He lived there from May 3, 1807 until his death in 1843. The building is located on the Neckar riverfront and is one of the most popularly known sites in T√ºbingen.  History  An inscription in the tower that reads: \\"1807-1834 / Here lived and rested H√∂lderlin\\" The construction of the building traces back to the 13th century. The stone foundation originates from the medieval city wall that originally ran along the northern bank of the Neckar. H√∂lderlin was forcibly admitted by his family to the clinic of physician Johann Autenrieth on September 15, 1806. The 34-year-old master carpenter Ernst Friedrich Zimmer acquired the property in 1807. H√∂lderlin was released on May 3, 1807, around the same time as Zimmer's purchase, with a prognosis of incurable illness and three years to live (\\"h√∂chstens noch drei Jahre\\").Anja Th√ºer: Forgotten History Autenrieth, meanwhile, had encouraged Zimmer to take H√∂lderlin into his home, and, looking back on the situation, Zimmer wrote: :\\"Ich besuchte H√∂lderlin im Klinikum und bedauerte ihn sehr, da√ü ein so sch√∂ner herrlicher Geist zu Grunde gehen soll. Da im Klinikum nichts weiter mit H√∂lderlin zu machen war, so machte der Kanzler Autenrit mir den Vorschlag H√∂lderlin in mein Haus aufzunehmen, er w√º√üte kein passenderes Lokal.\\"H√∂lderlin ‚Äì Gro√üe Stuttgarter Ausgabe ‚Äì S√§mtliche Werke, Hrsg: Friedrich Bei√üner/Adolf Beck, Band 7,3, Nr. 528 :\\"I visited H√∂lderlin in the clinic and regretted that such a beautiful, lordly spirit should perish. Because there was nothing more to be done with H√∂lderlin in the clinic, Autenrit made the suggestion to me to admit H√∂lderlin into my home, since he could not think of a more appropriate locale.\\" H√∂lderlin moved into the first floor of Zimmer's residence the day after his release and lived there until his death in 1843. During H√∂lderlin's tower period, he often wrote under the pseudonym Scardanelli. He also received visitors from the neighboring T√ºbinger Stift, the school H√∂lderlin himself had once attended. A visit to the ill H√∂lderlin by Eduard M√∂rike and Wilhelm Waiblinger, figures both known for their relationship to H√∂lderlin, is documented by Hermann Hesse in his 1914 short story \\"Im Presselschen Gartenhaus\\" (\\"In Pressel's Garden- House\\").

Initially, the street was a thoroughfare, but in the second half of the 19th century, it turned residential. It ran from the Brda river to Bydgoszcz northern part of town an has gradually become the city center of trade and entertainment. During the interwar period, Gda≈Ñska street was the third longest street in Bydgoszcz with a total length of 3.19 km. The street connects the Old Town with the northern areas of Bydgoszcz agglomeration. The southern part is the real \\"spinal column\\" of Bydgoszcz downtown and the most architecturally representative, while the northern part - from the Municipal Stadium to the northern boundaries of the city- is bordered by Forest Park of Culture and Leisure and the Gda≈Ñsk Forest. Rich architecturally, Gda≈Ñska Street has got many buildings registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage list. History Gda≈Ñska street was laid in the 1820s, following the old route leading to Gda≈Ñsk (parallel to Pomorska street).Brƒôczewska-Kulesza Daria, Derkowska-Kostkowska Bogna, Wysocka A., i inni: Ulica Gda≈Ñska. Przewodnik historyczny, Bydgoszcz 2003 The creation of the street is associated with the expansion of the city to the north, which happened after 1816, when the city bought the land east of the route to Gda≈Ñsk. The thoroughfare has been designed as a straight line, 26 meters wide: the land on both sides was then divided into plots, which became the property of individuals.Jastrzƒôbska-Puzowska, Iwona: Od miasteczka do metropolii. Rozw√≥j architektoniczny i urbanistyczny Bydgoszczy w latach 1850-1920. Wydawnictwo MADO. Toru≈Ñ 2005. , 978-83-89886-38-5 At the beginning suburbs were limited to the area delimited by the bridge on the Brda River, Gda≈Ñsk Gates, Carmelite Church (now Theatre Square) and the Old Church of the Holy Spirit (now Poor Clares' Church). The area has been the place where downtown townspeople used for their annual shooting competition, awarded by the \\"Golden Hen\\" badge\\". The first intersection in Gda≈Ñska street - with Dworcowa street and Pomorska street - is located at the medieval road fork leading to Koronowo. The pace of urban center development to the north-west has increased from 1850 on, after the construction of Railway Main Station in Bocianowo district which became city area. Gda≈Ñska street quickly became a central representative thoroughfare, and developed as a new city (). Inextricably linked with the development of the street was the construction of cross and parallel streets, enabling Gda≈Ñska street to connect to downtown district (on the other side of Brda river), the Bocianowo district to the west, and Grodztwo, Bielawy and Forest ( Le≈õne) districts to the east. This network of adjacent streets was created between 1850 and the early years of the 20th century. The only surviving old streets lattice, dating back to the Middle Ages, consists of Focha, Jagiello≈Ñska, Dworcowa and Pomorska streets. Important milestones in the evolution of Gda≈Ñska street were the setting up of Freedom Square (, ) in 1854, and Adam Mickiewicz Alley in 1903, since they particularly influenced sections of Gda≈Ñska street in these areas. On Freedom Square has been established consecutively: in 1876 the Evangelical parish church; in 1893 an equestrian statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I; and in 1904 a monumental fountain. After 1854, in the western part of the street -between Artyleryjska street and Powsta≈Ñc√≥w Warszawy street- was created a training and shooting area, which resulted in the development of the so-called \\"Barracks area\\". In 1861, the newly built Warsaw-Bydgoszcz railway line crossed Gda≈Ñska street at Artyleryjska street, cutting off those military areas and putting a provisional end to the northern extension. It was only in the 1930s, after a level crossing had been established, that further developments towards Forest district could resume. Street attractiveness declined after World War II. After 1996, a gradual revitalization began. In 1998, initial sections of the street (from downtown to Freedom Square) had their car traffic significantly reduced. In 2002‚Äì2007, a modernization of the pavement was performed, as well as roads and streetcar railways, and stylish lighting has been installed. Continuous work is also underway to restore buildings facades and interiors. In 2005 and 2006, two sculptures by Micha≈Ç Kubiak were unveiled: \\"The Wanderer\\" and \\"Marian Rejewski on a bench\\". Naming Since Gda≈Ñska Street was formed in two steps, it had originally two names. Its primary section - from Brda river to Dworcowa street - dating back to the 14th century, was called Gda≈Ñska street (), while the extension that started in 1820 was named Road of Gda≈Ñsk (, ). Later, with urban development, Gda≈Ñska street was the denomination of subsequent extensions (in 1879 it stretched to Warsaw Uprising street intersection). In 1977, the street reached its current administrative length and borders, and therefore \\"Gda≈Ñska street\\" indicates now the road leading from Bydgoszcz Old Town up to the northern boundary of the city. Successive names of the street in its historic section are as follows:* 1820-1920 ‚Äì Danzigerstra√üe / Danziger Chaussee; 1920-1939 ‚Äì Gda≈Ñska street; 1939-1945 ‚Äì Adolf-Hitler-Stra√üe; 1945-1990 ‚Äì 1 May Avenue, and since 1990 ‚Äì Gda≈Ñska street. Tract division Once Gda≈Ñska street set up, the land situated on both sides has been divided into plots and sold to individuals. Probably most of the plots all the way to ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñskia street, has been drawn around the 1850s and their limits are still the same today. The parcelling process of properties on Gda≈Ñska street and their numbering was finally completed in February 1931, followed by the administrative imposition for even-numbered (eastern side) and odd ones (on the west). Between 1879 and 1931, 169 numbers were registered and since 1931, 190 are in use in total. Following adjustments were related to the further development of the street to the north, especially on the eastern side. Currently, the highest administrative number is 260, corresponding to the Forest district (\\"My≈õlƒôcinek\\") area. Development of buildings and means of communication The origins of road construction dates back to 1448, when were erected the buildings of the Old Church and Hospital of the Holy Spirit (now Poor Clares' Church), just on the immediate northern side of the river. In 1615, the Church of Rome took over the Order of Saint Clare, which had a significant impact on the Poor Clares' Church architecture: until the mid-17th century, the building was redesigned in the late Gothic - Renaissance style and the sublime monastery's cloister connected with the temple. At the end of the 18th century, there were several residential buildings along Gda≈Ñska street: in addition to the Church, an inn was standing at the crossroads with the road to Koronowo and ≈öwiecie. In 1816, Gliszczy≈Ñski family established another inn at the location of the current Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\". The rapid development of building frontage along the entire length of Gda≈Ñska street took place after 1835. Around 1860, edifices extended up to the crossing with ≈öniadeckich street, then in 1870 up to the ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñski street, while basic, core building across Kamienna street -where there was a level crossing- was established in 1890. After 1900 were built the first large buildings in the northern part of the street including: Water Supply station (1899-1900); War College building (1913-1914); buildings within the newly created Forest district () after 1933, like houses at No.208 to 238. In the 1950s, new buildings in Osiedle Le≈õne have been constructed, such as the \\"Zawisza\\" WKS sports complex. In 1860, the street began to be illuminated with gas lanterns, and with electric lights since 1900. Street on the entire length of the road had paved surfaces, separating curbs, along with a tree line. The sidewalks were laid from granite boards. On May 18, 1888, was launched a horsepowered tram, along the so-called \\"Red\\" line (from Theatre Square to Dworcowa street) and in 1892 a second line, \\"Green\\", has been launched (along the entire length of Gda≈Ñska street to the artillery barracks). Trams were electrified in 1896, and in 1937, in connection with the creation of the district Forest, a bus line has been launched. In 1932, with the construction of Polish Coal Trunk-Line, a viaduct has been built over the railway (named after J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki), has been rebuilt in 1968 and 2006, and the level crossing was closed. In 1989, a viaduct was built for the tram and a tram terminal set up in the immediate vicinity of the Forest Park of Culture and Leisure, at the intersection with Rekreacyjna street. In 2012 first contraflow lanes for cyclists have appeared in Gda≈Ñska street.  Architecture  The landscape of Gda≈Ñska street has remained unchanged for over 150 years. Be that as it may, the lengthy construction process made the ensemble of the whole street much diversified. Adjacent houses, hence, generally come from different eras, with different scales and styles. Originally sections up to ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska street consisted mainly of tenements for rent, and further north were reserved plots for construction of grander buildings with front-garden. Between 1890 and 1914 a significant increased number of grandiose buildings were constructed including: nine grand habitation houses, at No.16, 27, 30, 34, 51, 55, 63, 62 and 95; and several reconstructed or built villas for rich industrialists and bureaucrats, like at No.48 & 50, with dominant architectural importance. Until the end of the 19th century, the predominant style was Neo-Classicism: tenements were built with simple, symmetrical facades and usually modest decoration. In the last quarter of the 19th century, classicism forms were tinged with Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Baroque elements. Between 1885 and 1898, Bydgoszcz's architect J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki built 21 edifices along Gda≈Ñska street, and associated Eclecticism with different new styles: some of his projects permanently etched the street landscape with Neo-Baroque designs, such as No.14, 36, 63, or Freedom Square No.1. Best instance is Hotel Pod Orlem at Gda≈Ñska street No.1 which is now a real showcase of Bydgoszcz's architecture. At the beginning of the 20th century, houses were built following German Historicism, pioneering architecture style. As such, specific architects possessed their own characteristics: Fritz Weidner represented the picturesque current; Rudolf Kern, the German Secession; Alfred Schleusener and Paul Sellner the early Modern Architecture. Houses built in the 1930s in the northern part of the street follows so-called International Style with simple cubic lumps, like Jan Kossowski's works. After World War II, building architecture was styleless, as displayed in the features from this period: Supermarket \\"Rywal\\" (1971-1973) at No.47 or three typical houses at No.23, 53 & 76\\\\. Three new edifices have been erected between 1990 and 2005 in Gda≈Ñska Street, No.121, 125 & 139, none of which fits into a proper style regarding the surrounding buildings. At the eve of the 20th century, several architecturally interesting buildings, referring to Eclecticism and Art Nouveau, rose in the network of adjacent streets buildings. Such realizations can be found mainly in following places: Krasinski St., S≈Çowacki St., Adam Mickiewicz Alley, Cieszkowski Street, Paderewski Street, Weyssenhoff Square, 20 January 1920 Street and partly in buildings around ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñskiego St., Zamoyskiego St. and Chodkiewicza St.  Social Role  Paul Storz Tenement (left), and Otto Riedl Tenement (right) The role of Gda≈Ñska Street, till 1850, was principally that of a means of communication; after this date, it became a representative, bourgeois area and the expanding axis of downtown Bydgoszcz. The buildings giving onto the street have been housing a mix of wealthy representative officials, manufacturers and traders of different professions, whereas craftsmen and laborers lived in the outbuildings and more modest homes. Habitation ground floors were generally designed to house commercial or catering service. The area of Gda≈Ñska Street soon experienced a booming trade expansion: craft workshops developed -20 tailors and 25 shoemakers were referenced in the street at the end of the 19th century, as well as small industry and gastronomy. Nonetheless, the street did not suffer from any rapid industrialization process: very few companies (with the exception of G. Rady's factory of artistic metalwork in 1896) did build typical factory buildings on this axis. The only companies operating in the area were quite modest and housed in buildings backyards. The shop on Gda≈Ñska street which has the longest history is the pharmacy \\"Under the Swan\\", located at No.5 since 1853. At the beginning of the 20th century, department stores began to appear: in 1910, Modehaus Bromberg lasted a couple of years in 1911, Department Store \\"Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne\\"; in 1919, Boniface Cyrus shop. At the beginning of the 20th century, the street was also the address of 5 banks seat. Gda≈Ñska Street had also an important role in catering and entertainment business. During the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, it was the venue of restaurants and caf√©s for wealthy people, locations for modest retailshops, brasseries, as well as concert halls, hotels, theaters, cinemas. The street also housed the first seat of Provincial and Municipal Public Library at No.27. Street Festival Each September, since 2002, the \\"Gda≈Ñska Street Festival\\" ( ≈öwiƒôto Ulicy Gda≈Ñskiej) is the time for outdoor events, concerts and competitions held in different places and buildings along the street. The main organizer of the event is Bydgoszcz's branch of Gazeta Wyborcza.  The street today  Gda≈Ñska Street is 7.3 kilometers long, with a 2 km long stylish houses section, and 1.5 km away to the north the city's barracks and the forest district. In fact the 3.8 km long stretch of road located north of the railway viaduct has a completely different character from the urbanized one, between Gda≈Ñsk forest and the Culture and Leisure Forest Park. On the northern outskirts of the city, the street climbs up the 45-meter high Fordo≈Ñski rising. Along Gda≈Ñska street one will find: three churches; four museums (District museum, Pharmacy museum, Museum of the Army and Sports museum); concert halls (Academy of Music, \\"Club M√≥zg\\") and the seat of Radio PIK; the oldest hotel of the city (Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\"); one of the oldest department stores, the Department Store \\"Jedynak\\" built on the like of Berlin and Paris department stores at the beginning of the 20th century; landscape architecture, including \\"Marian Rejewski on a bench\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\", as well as two sculptures created with dead trees Woman in pigeons at No.30 and As soon as we play at the intersection of Gda≈Ñska St. and S≈Çowacki Street.

Architecture A walk through Gda≈Ñska Street and nearby areas gives an overview of styles and trends of last two centuries construction style. One- storey houses (representing suburban housing type) mix with two and three story tenements (close to 100 of them), as well as urban four and five story buildings and monumental buildings. More than 90% of the building in Gda≈Ñska Street dates back from before 1920. Half of them have been built or rebuilt in the years 1890‚Äì1914, when wealthy Bydgoszcz inhabitants put proudness in architecture, fashioning different styles, from Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic, Neo-Baroque, to Secession and early Modern architecture. Buildings along Gda≈Ñska Street are realizations of Bydgoszcz/Bromberg's most prominent architects, including: J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki (21 buildings, 20 still left); Fritz Weidner - 8 buildings; Rudolf Kern - 7 buildings; Karl Bergner - 5 buildings; Alfred Schleusener - 3 buildings; Carl Rose - 2 buildings; Paul Sellner - 2 buildings. Some of them were architects from Berlin, like Heinrich Seeling, Otto Walther or W. Hildebrandt. In side streets, there are a large number of tenements constructed before 1914: over 30 tenements by Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki, 19 from Rudolf Kern, 14 from Fritz Weidner and a number of them by other builders (i.e. Karl Bergner, Paul B√∂hm, Erich Lindenburger).

This is an advancement of the perceptron which does not incorporate a spike timing framework. It is general consensus that spike timing (STDP) plays a crucial role in the development of synaptic efficacy for many different kinds of neurons Caporale, N., & Dan, Y. (2008). Spike timing-dependent plasticity: a Hebbian learning rule. Annu Rev Neurosci, 31, 25-46. Therefore a large variety of STDP-rules has been developed one of which is the tempotron. Algorithm Assuming a leaky integrate-and-fire-model the potential V(t) of the synapse can be described by V(t)= \\\\sum _i \\\\omega _i\\\\sum _{t_i}K(t-t_i) +V_{rest}, where t_i denotes the spike time of the i-th afferent synapse with synaptic efficacy \\\\omega _i and V_{rest} the resting potential. K(t-t_i) describes the postsynaptic potential (PSP) elicited by each incoming spike: K(t-t_i) = \\\\begin{cases} V_0[\\\\exp(-(t-t_i)/\\\\tau)-\\\\exp(-(t-t_i)/\\\\tau_s)] & t\\\\geq t_i  0 & t< t_i \\\\end{cases} with parameters \\\\tau and \\\\tau_s denoting decay time constants of the membrane integration and synaptic currents. The factor V_0 is used for the normalization of the PSP kernels. When the potential crosses the firing threshold V_{th} the potential is reset to its resting value by shunting all incoming spikes. Next, a binary classification of the input patterns is needed(\\\\circ refers to a pattern which should elicit at least one post synaptic action potential and \\\\bullet refers to a pattern which should have no response accordingly). In the beginning, the neuron does not know which pattern belongs to which classification and has to learn it iteratively, similar to the perceptron . The tempotron learns its tasks by adapting the synaptic efficacy \\\\omega _i. If a \\\\circ pattern is presented and the postsynaptic neuron did not spike, all synaptic efficacies are increased by \\\\Delta \\\\omega _i whereas a \\\\bullet pattern followed by a postsynaptic response leads to a decrease of the synaptic efficacies by \\\\Delta \\\\omega _i with Robert G√ºtig, Haim Sompolinsky (2006): The tempotron: a neuron that learns spike timing-based decisions, Nature Neuroscience vol. 9, no.3, 420-428 \\\\Delta \\\\omega _i=\\\\lambda \\\\sum _{t_i Here t_{max} denotes the time at which the postsynaptic potential V(t) reaches its maximal value.

From 1998 to 1999 he was a State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Finance () where he also advised former finance minister Oskar Lafontaine on a reform of the European Monetary System. He became the Chief of Macroeconomics and Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva in January 2003, a position that he held until resigning at the end of 2012 due to his age.  Life  Heiner Flassbeck studied economics at Saarland University (1971‚Äì1976). During that time he was assistant at chair of Wolfgang St√ºtzel with emphasis on currency issues. Afterwards, up to 1980 he worked in the assistants staff of the German Council of Economic Experts. 1987 he received a doctors degree Dr. rer. pol. at the Free University of Berlin with his work: Prices, Interest and Currency Rate. On Theory of Open Economy at flexible Exchange Rates (). After he was operating at the Federal Ministry for Economy and Technology since 1980, he changed over to the German Institute for Economic Research () in Berlin in 1986, where he worked on labour market- and business cycle analysis and concepts of economic policy. 1990 he became head of the department business cycle at the institute. When the government changed in October 1998 he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance in the first Schr√∂der cabinet. He counseled the former finance minister Oskar Lafontaine with his intent to establish together with French finance minister Dominique Strauss- Kahn a Keynesian fiscal policy and monetary policy on level of the European Union and to reform the international monetary system. After Oskar Lafontaine resigned from minister in March 1999, Flassbeck's work as a state secretary ended in April 1999 as well. That followed a period of working free lance as an economic researcher and a publicist. From November 2000 to December 2002 he worked as a senior economist at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). From January 2003 up to his service retirement he was the chief economist, Chief of Macroeconomics and Development of the UNCTAD, since August 2003 Director of Division on Globalization and Development Strategies. The Hamburg University of Economics and Politics appointed Flassbeck an honorary professor in March 2005.Persondata about Heiner Flassbeck at the Hamburg University  Positions on economic policy  In his early scientific career, in the 1980s, Flassbeck in particular dealt with questions of foreign trade theory (an area of International economics) and monetary policy. In his work Free trade, GATT and the international currency system () he offered an essay to redefine the benefits of free trade based on a new trade theory. In frame of a system of flexible currency rates a decision between protectionism and free trade could not be made and in addition the targeted national autonomy in monetary policy not be achieved. In his dissertation from 1988, Prices, Interest and Currency Rate, he spoke for \\"absolutely fixed currency rates\\" as only solution that could ensure an efficient and continuous adjustment of global economy and outer price stability. According to Flassbeck, the effects by revaluation and devaluation at flexible currency rates were equal to state interference at its discretion and as much exogenous as non-market driven changes in currency rate. Flassbeck explained his positions on economic policy together with economist Frederike Spiecker in their book The End of Mass Unemployment (). He does not consider the reasons for the weak growth and mass unemployment of many years in Germany as a result of technological progress, globalization or too high wages, but as a consequence of a not demand-orientated policy. Flassbeck since then instead advocates an economic policy which follows basic Keynesian principles and claims a \\"reform of thinking\\". After the first worsening of the financial crisis since 2007 he published his book: Failed. Why politics surrenders to economy (). There he particularly highlights the omissions made by German economics policy during the German reunification and its recurrence at the European monetary union. He put the economic crisis down to a structure- conservative policy which focused on individual economic (microeconomic) particular interests, with what the market economy in the end was questioned. In September 2010 Flassbecks book The Market Economy of the 21st Century () was released: shocks and crisis were the normality in a market economy system, periods of stability the exceptional case. It needed an international monetary system like it already rudimentarily had existed in the early postwar period with the Bretton Woods system. In the new market economy of the 21st century, for every problem solutions should open-ended be searched for, which either could be borne by market or by state. Interests, exchange rates and prices for natural ressources would clearly belong to state price control on international level. Already in a system of decontrolled financial markets as existent since beginning of the 1980s, the price formation by way of supply and demand was suspended ‚Äî so that a market in the classical meaning had not been existent there. Flassbecks latest publication, the Ten Myths of Crisis (), predominantly contains a political evaluation of the finance- and eurozone crisis, as well as the estimation that the economic \\"Aufkl√§rung\\" could be achieved not until a future expectable new crisis happens. = Saving and investment = Flassbeck assigns a major role to the insight that a national economy cannot save: the common understanding that a national economy could gain net savings, thus saving money during a certain period of time to finance investment in a future period using saved money, was false. This thinking by Flassbeck follows the results of Balances Mechanics developed by German economist Wolfgang St√ºtzel. Saving of one economic unit currently inevitably led to revenue loss of another unit. At present somebody in the economy was stuck with his supply. Expenses which are not done would fall away in same height. Because the sum of revenues, with that the incomes, of all economic units equals the sum of all expenses and with that the overall demand of all economic units, incomes would decline in future. The income generated in one period was to be used \\"always\\". By analogy with \\"time saving\\", which cannot be saved, saving in terms of not-using could not exist in an economy. Today's investments were the condition to build up assets, not invers. Both quantities were equal solely in an ex-post examination. From the people's and economic politicians' ignorance about the difference between the overall economic and the individual economic unit view, according to Flassbeck, many fallacies of today's economics can be analysed. For example, national debt was falsely seen as debts towards future generations, but in fact the welfare of a country was determined solely by its future capital stock, thus mainly by the existing machines and facilities plus the standing of qualification of its population and the social capital (which enclosures the stability of the society's constitution). On macroeconomic level debt was only problematic if it existed net towards the foreign sector. = Monetary, fiscal and wage policy = Flassbeck sees the need for a coordination of monetary policy, wage policy and fiscal policy. He assigns monetary policy an outstanding impact on growth and employment and refuses its shortening on retaining price stability. He declares monetarism fauiled to control inflation through money supply. It had been practised in the 1980s by some federal banks in response to the oil crisis and the stagflation going along with it in the 1970s but led to drop of investments and high unemployment. It was abandoned by the 1990s. Flassbeck emphasises the speciality of the German and European monetary policy, which, contrary to the majority of central banks, retained monetarism. Flassbeck cites that the monetary policy of the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB) to control the money supply ever geared to the potential output of the past. If economic growth would exceed money supply respectively Gross National Product, the estimated potential output, the ECB would swivel in the Bundesbank already in advance to a restriction course without a noteworthy endangering of price stability by exceeding the target inflation rate. One could never set a potential output beforehand. Flassbeck also considers the target inflation rate of the ECB to be too low and refers to the height at other major central banks. According to Flassbeck, wage policy should work towards a macroeconomic \\"distribution neutral\\" wage adjustment. The optimal rate of wage increases would result from the addition of inflation rate and rise of labour productivity. Flassbeck views the labour agreement on national area as solution best compatible with market economy. The mechanism would accomplish the law of one price, the law of the same price for same goods against the labour market's imperfections and information asymmetries.Heiner Flassbeck: Who owns the world? Power struggling for ressources. (German) Lecture at: 25. Heidelberger Symposium, Heidelberg University, 2013. (video, 44 min.) = European Monetary Union and crisis = Flassbeck views a currency union primarily as an \\"inflation community\\".‚ÄûArbeitnehmer werden doppelt bestraft‚Äú, Salzburger Nachrichten, 17 June 2011 This means that all member countries of a monetary union had to show the same price change rate. That could only be achieved by equalisation of growth of unit labour costs, with the aim to maintain the price competitiveness of all countries and to avoid high current account surpluses as well as deficits. As consequence for the eurozone he requests that all euro states had to comply with the Central Bank's target inflation rate. Because Germany had seriously undershot this target inflation rate through its concept of \\"wage restraint\\" since introduction of the monetary union, while other countries have met or slightly exceeded it, the German industry had gained market share on a large scale to the expense of the other countries in the eurozone. As solution for this problem, which he considers as the fundamental cause of the euro crisis, he proposes coordination of wage policies in the European monetary union. In view of the facts that the option of revaluations and devaluations is not given anymore because of the abolition of national currencies, the only alternative was a real devaluation of states with high current account deficits such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, as well as a real revaluation of Germany ‚Äî brought by steadily higher wage increases in Germany than in the other eurozone countries.Heiner Flassbeck & Friederike Spieker, \\"The Euro: a Story of Misunderstanding\\", Intereconomics 4/2011, p. 180‚Äì187. = German \\"Wirtschaftswunder\\" = Flassbeck does not attribute the Wirtschaftswunder (German for economic miracle) in the 1950s and 1960s to the economic policy of Ludwig Erhard and his only partially applied concept of an ordoliberal social market economy, but to the American monetary policy which, during the time of the Bretton Woods system (until about 1973), had significantly influenced the German interest level. Also, the steady exchange rates which often reflected an underrated D-Mark (former German currency), had essentially benefited the catching up of the other countries. Furthermore, Flassbeck compares the German economy growth in the years of the \\"Wirtschaftswunder\\" with other countries and concludes that West German growth rates were only slightly higher than those of France and Italy in the 1950s, but that already in the 1960s, it was slower than the average of those countries. In comparison with the growth of the Japanese economy, which much less had been geared to market economy and competition, the economic miracle appeared \\"like a stroll\\". Only the United Kingdom had not been able to keep up with that continental European and Japanese development.Heiner Flassbeck: Das Ende der Massenarbeitslosigkeit, p. 149  Statements on today's economic policy and the European crisis  In media Flassbeck frequently holds his views on economic policy and theory, which in part are in favour of Keynesianism and particularly Joseph Schumpeter and Wilhelm Lautenbach. In April 2010, facing the beginning monetary crisis, also called euro crisis in Germany, he demanded to \\"separate the deals of the gamblers from the normal market activities\\" of banks. The function of rating agencies should no longer be left to the private sector. The austerity requested from Greece was unrealistic; the principal problem was not Greece but the economic imbalance in the European economic area, in particular concerning the competitiveness of the South European countries. A working market economy in the 21st century had the following needs/necessities/musts: ::\\"It will take a Global Governance. Globalisation requires global rules. The G-20-states are a step towards that, albeit not the best one. Better would be the UNO, but things take very long there. Moreover the European monetary union must be rescued, otherwise the European Union will fall apart too. Thirdly, the participation of all people must domestically be secured. Wages must rise ‚Äî as much as the increase in productivity. At climate protection the oil price must not be set by speculation anymore ‚Äî it is to be taken out of market system and supranationally controlled.\\" In May 2013 Flassbeck wrote, it was irresponsible in the political discourse to repress the option to exit the Euro and that Germany without doubt would be hit hard in an exit scenario. On the possibilities to solve the crisis in the eurozone he demanded Germany to radically change its position to reduce the slope of competitiveness in the eurozone. On the question if the government would behave successfully in the Euro crisis, Flassbeck in an interview with n-TV commented: ::\\"Nothing has happened at the internal economic trend. We have driven the other countries against the wall. Our customers are on the way going bust ... I don't know if one can call that successful.\\"  Publications German= * Environment and Economy ().

Johnstone which stands on a slight promontory beside Morecambe Bay on the eastern approach to Morecambe, Lancashire, England. The sculpture The sculpture depicts a seated woman, facing out to sea, holding the hands of a child who is suspended in the air extending horizontally from her arms, as if being swung round. It is covered in multicoloured mosaic. It was originally intended for St George's Quay in Lancaster. It was erected in 2005 on Scalestone Point, site of a former gun emplacement, between the coast road and the sea, and commemorates the 24 cockle-pickers who died in the bay in 2004. In 2011 the artist threatened to destroy the sculpture because the local council was not prepared to pay for its insurance and upkeep. The Venus & Cupid Arts Trust was formed to save the sculpture and to care for other public art in Morecambe. The trust is responsible for the sculpture's insurance, maintenance and repairs. The sculpture was damaged by frost in the winter of 2017‚Äì2018, which caused some of the mosaic tiles to fall off. It was moved temporarily into the Arndale Centre in Morecambe in November 2018, for repair, and was returned to the sea front in June 2019. The sculptor, Shane Johnstone, used the Japanese technique of Kintsugi, replacing the missing tiles with gold leaf to celebrate the repair rather than attempting to hide it. The repair cost over ¬£4,000, including the cost of moving the sculpture. The artist Shane Johnstone describes himself as \\"Originally a fairground artist in Blackpool and Morecambe\\".

Robinson, an unarmed 19-year-old man, was fatally shot by Madison police officer Matthew Kenny, during a \\"check-person\\" call. Kenny was responding to dispatch reports that Robinson was jumping in front of cars and acting erratically, and that he had harmed someone in an apartment. On May 12, 2015, the shooting was determined to be justified self-defense by the Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne. The death was protested by the Black Lives Matter movement; Robinson was biracial and of African American descent. Shooting On March 6, 2015, the police received reports that 19-year-old Tony Robinson was yelling and jumping in front of cars. Robinson had reportedly been running in and out of the street while shouting at bystanders. Some of the reports were from friends of Robinson, who were concerned by his erratic behavior and called for help. The original caller and witnesses all stated that Robinson was unarmed and expressed concern over his well-being. 45-year-old officer Matt Kenny responded to the call to \\"check person\\" at 6:30 pm. Officer Kenny was backed up by Sergeant Gary and Officer Christian. Gary and Christian arrived to the front of the residence as Kenny was standing in the entrance to the stairwell by the open door. Officer Kenny went into the open side porch door into a stairway of twelve steps. According to Kenny, based upon shouting he overheard, he believed that Robinson was assaulting someone in the second-floor apartment, and went in to stop it. Kenny encountered an aggressive Robinson at the top of the stairs, who punched Kenny in the head, causing Kenny to sustain a concussion. Kenny feared for his life, as he could be knocked down the stairs and have his weapon taken, and fatally shot Robinson to protect himself. The Robinson estate's description of the events alleges that Kenny was dispatched to a \\"check person\\" call, knew that he should wait for backup, but entered the building with his weapon drawn anyway. Then, as he stood near the bottom of the stairwell, Robinson appeared at the top, and Kenny fired unnecessarily. Robinson fell down the stairs and Kenny fired the fatal shots as he lay helpless at the bottom of the stairs. Sergeant Gary, first on scene after Kenny asked Kenny if Robinson had any weapons. Kenny replied that Robinson did not have any weapons. Sergeant Gary saw Robinson laying at the bottom of the stairs on his back with his feet out the door. Sergeant Gary saw Robinson gasp for breath and pull his hands inward toward the front of his body near his stomach. Sergeant Gary noted that Robinson had nothing in his hands. Sergeant Gary also noted that Officer Kenny appeared to have no injuries. Physical evidence at the scene showed all bullet casings at the bottom of the stairs, the entryway, and outside the stairwell on the porch. Squad video footage showed Kenny exiting the house as he was firing the final 3-4 shots. Further evidence at the scene showed Robinson's blood on the wall at 5 feet above the top of the fifth step from the entryway. Additionally, Gary went upstairs and cleared the apartment but did not find anyone. Kenny went to the hospital, and photographs indicate that he had a cut on the left side of his head, near his hairline. Medical personnel cleaned the cut and did not need to bandage it. Kenny denied having pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or visual changes, but he was diagnosed with a head injury about a month after the incident. Robinson was taken to UW Hospital in Madison, WI where he was pronounced dead. Autopsy results confirmed that Robinson had been struck by 7 bullets that were from 0‚Äì5 foot range. Officer Kenny had no confirmed injuries and although he claimed a concussion 28 days after the shooting incident a ruling by Judge James Petersen said Kenny's claims of concussion were not verifiable and only based on Kenny's ‚Äúsay-so‚Äù Robinson was determined post-mortem to have ingested Xanax, psilocybin mushrooms, and THC hours before the shooting. The drugs may have contributed to his erratic behavior. Background Court documents show that Robinson was on probation after pleading guilty to armed robbery in 2014. This stemmed from a home-invasion robbery in which Robinson was caught by police fleeing the scene, armed with a fake, but realistic-looking gun. In 2007, Officer Matt Kenny had shot and killed Ronald Brandon, who was standing on the porch of his home, holding what was later learned was a pellet gun. The case was determined to be \\"suicide by cop\\". Aftermath The Black Lives Matter movement has protested Robinson's death. Some 1,500 protesters, mostly high school students who had staged a walk-out, filled the state capitol on March 9 to protest Robinson's death, yelling the \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\" chant through the capital building. The Wisconsin Department of Justice investigated the Robinson shooting, as required by Wisconsin law. Robinson's uncle said that the family had faith that the Division of Criminal Investigation will \\"handle [the investigation] with integrity\\". On May 12, 2015, Dane County District Attorney, Ismael Ozanne, announced that Officer Matt Kenny would not face charges for the shooting of Tony Robinson. The shooting was labeled a \\"lawful use of deadly police force.\\" In February, 2017, Robinson's family accepted a $3.35 million settlement from the city, to settle a civil rights lawsuit.

Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011. NLI works through identifying language-usage patterns that are common to specific L1 groups and then applying this knowledge to predict the native language of previously unseen texts. This is motivated in part by applications in second-language acquisition, language teaching and forensic linguistics, amongst others.  Overview  NLI works under the assumption that an author's L1 will dispose them towards particular language production patterns in their L2, as influenced by their native language. This relates to cross-linguistic influence (CLI), a key topic in the field of second-language acquisition (SLA) that analyzes transfer effects from the L1 on later learned languages. Using large-scale English data, NLI methods achieve over 80% accuracy in predicting the native language of texts written by authors from 11 different L1 backgrounds. This can be compared to a baseline of 9% for choosing randomly. ApplicationsPedagogy and language transfer= This identification of L1-specific features has been used to study language transfer effects in second-language acquisition.Malmasi, Shervin, and Mark Dras. \\"Language Transfer Hypotheses with Linear SVM Weights.\\" Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). 2014. This is useful for developing pedagogical material, teaching methods, L1-specific instructions and generating learner feedback that is tailored to their native language. =Forensic linguistics= NLI methods can also be applied in forensic linguistics as a method of performing authorship profiling in order to infer the attributes of an author, including their linguistic background. This is particularly useful in situations where a text, e.g. an anonymous letter, is the key piece of evidence in an investigation and clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in identifying the source. This has already attracted interest and funding from intelligence agencies.Ria Perkins. 2014. \\"Linguistic identifiers of L1 Persian speakers writing in English: NLID for authorship analysis\\". Ph.D. thesis, Aston University.  Methodology  Natural language processing methods are used to extract and identify language usage patterns common to speakers of an L1-group. This is done using language learner data, usually from a learner corpus. Next, machine learning is applied to train classifiers, like support vector machines, for predicting the L1 of unseen texts.Tetreault et al, \\"Native Tongues, Lost and Found: Resources and Empirical Evaluations in Native Language Identification\\", In Proc. International Conf. on Computational Linguistics (COLING), 2012 A range of ensemble based systems have also been applied to the task and shown to improve performance over single classifier systems.Malmasi, Shervin, Sze-Meng Jojo Wong, and Mark Dras. \\"NLI Shared Task 2013: MQ submission\\". Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications. 2013. Various linguistic feature types have been applied for this task. These include syntactic features such as constituent parses, grammatical dependencies and part-of-speech tags. Surface level lexical features such as character, word and lemma n-grams have also been found to be quite useful for this task. However, it seems that character n-gramsRadu Tudor Ionescu, Marius Popescu and Aoife Cahill. \\"String Kernels for Native Language Identification: Insights from Behind the Curtains\\", Computational Linguistics, 2016Radu Tudor Ionescu and Marius Popescu. \\"Can string kernels pass the test of time in Native Language Identification?\\", In Proceedings of BEA12, 2017. are the single best feature for the task.  2013 shared task  The Building Educational Applications (BEA) workshop at NAACL 2013 hosted the inaugural NLI shared task.Tetreault et al, \\"A report on the first native language identification shared task\\", 2013 The competition resulted in 29 entries from teams across the globe, 24 of which also published a paper describing their systems and approaches.

Following this, she danced as a principal with numerous companies in Germany (Fountainhead Tanz Theater, Dance Butter Tokyo and Pyro Space Ballet [1992-1995]) as well as the United States (Cleo Parker Robinson [1996-1999] and Dayton Contemporary Dance Company [1999-2000]). She was critically acclaimed for her performance Stravinsky‚Äôs Firebird as ‚ÄúFirebird‚Äù with the Denver Symphony under the direction of Marion Alstop and choreographed by Cleo Parker Robinson. During this time, Ms. Yatkin worked with such leading choreographers as Donald McKayle, Eleo Pomare, Anzu Furukawa, Katherine Dunham, and Ron Brown among many others. In 2000, Ms. Yatkin began choreographing solo works for herself inspired by Martha Graham and other great female choreographers who all started as soloists and later moved to choreograph on companies. To date, she has choreographed on the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble, Dallas Black Dance Theatre, the Washington Ballet, the Maryland Dance Ensemble and the Baltimore Ballet. Her work has toured the world: Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Guatemala, El Salvador, England, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Santo Domingo, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United States and Yugoslavia. Additionally, it has been performed in some excellent venues. For example, as a Guest Choreographer with the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Company, her work was commissioned and presented at Lincoln Center Out of Doors (2001) as well as the Joyce Theater (2003). Other venues include Dance Place and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (Washington, D.C.), The Place in London, England, Metropolitano in Medellin, Colombia and the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba, Brazil among many others. Philosophy In her choreography, she explores the beauty as well as complexity of memory, migration, transformation, identity and multiculturalism through movement. ‚ÄúThis is achieved by drawing upon diverse traditions of dance, cultures and medium as well as utilizing subjects that are at once universal and timeless. Through dance, Ms. Yatkin seeks what Isaiah Berlin refers to as an ‚Äúawareness of the deep currents‚Äù ‚Äì a comprehension of the connection between all things, an awareness of the present as well as that which transcends time and space. The paths along this quest are numerous (each culture and each time period has their own variant of the theme). To embrace all of these approaches is to embrace nothing less than our humanity, our common journey on this planet of existence. While this involves a discussion of the past and present, it also involves a discussion of the future. First, she draw from the most basic and ultimate instrument ‚Äì the human body. ‚ÄúThis lies at the core of our existence and it has done so since the birth of humanity, predating even speech as a means of expression.‚Äù Second, Ms.Yatkin draws from history. She has drawn from Jose Limon, Donald McKayle, Eleo Pomare and danced in many modern dance classics during my professional dancing career like Kathrine Dunham, Talley Beatty, Donald McKayle, Merce Cunningham and Dianne McIntyre. She worked on reconstructing a solo entitled Terpsichore created by Barbara Gardner in 1973. Barbara Garder, who is a student of Mary Wigman, created this work as a homage to Mary Wigman upon her death in 1973. Through my work she attempts ‚Äúto not only create but preserve. Third, drawing upon her multi-cultural background, as a choreographer, Ms. Yatkin has brought together influences from a variety of places: specific geographic locales such as the Mediterranean, which brings together Africa, Asia and Europe (where her family comes from) and United States, which brings together individuals from all around the world. This led to working in a range of techniques/places/companies. For example, Dance Butter Tokyo was a dance theatre company combining Japanese Butoh with German Dance Theatre and Mark Headley fused Afro Caribbean with American Modern Dance. This also is expressed in diverse dance education. Rooted in American Modern dance ‚Äì both modern as well as older forms, Ms. Yatkin simultaneously interested in dance traditions from around the world (e.g., Japanese Butoh Dance, Turkish Folkdance, Middle Eastern Dance and West African Dance). Fourth, she draws on ancient myths but also upon modern theatre traditions, cinematic techniques, poetry as well as physical and psychological theories.

Yatkin"},{"id":"45628053","text":"Open College was a radio-based university-credit distance education provider based in Toronto, Canada; it primarily served listeners in Ontario. Founded in 1971, the courses were accredited by Ryerson Polytechnic Institute and York University's Atkinson College and broadcast throughout Toronto and much of southern Ontario on what was then Ryerson owned radio station CJRT which produced and administered the courses. The service was conceived of by the Dean of Arts of Ryerson Polytechnic Institute who was inspired by the creation of Open University in the United Kingdom, which used radio and television to broadcast some of its credit courses. In 1969, CJRT began broadcasting a non- credit education series which led to the development of credit courses two years later. Ryerson sociology professor Margaret Norquay volunteered for the project and produced its first course, Introduction to Sociology, which commenced in January 1971. Norquay went on to become Open College's first director in 1972. In 1974, Ryerson divested itself of CJRT and the radio station became an independent government funded corporation with Open College as one of its departments. The service used the name \\"Open College\\" due to its open admissions policy. At its peak, Open College offered 28 credit courses, produced at the radio station and accredited by Ryerson and Atkinson College. An estimated 15,000 students took courses using the service during its existence with student enrollment peaking in 1995. By the 1980s Open College broadcasts were heard throughout Ontario as CJRT was added to the FM services offered by cable systems throughout the province. Alberta's public radio broadcaster, CKUA, purchased and broadcast several Open College courses which were broadcast in conjunction with credit courses at Athabasca University; CKUA has continued to develop educational broadcasts in conjunction with Athabasca. In 1999, the administration of Open College was transferred to Ryerson University. In 2003, as a result in the development of the internet as a mode of transmission for distance education and the resulting decline of interest in taking radio courses, as well as CJRT's transformation into an all-jazz radio station, radio broadcasts ended and the service was transferred to Ryerson's G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education which now offers distance education through the internet instead of by radio. In its last years, Open College broadcasts were aired Sunday mornings from 6am to 8am.

It was produced by Gaughan, Irvine and Carsten Linden with a line-up including Gaughan (acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitar and vocal), Irvine (bouzouki, mandola, mandolin, harmonica, hurdy-gurdy, vocal), Nollaig Casey (fiddle), Martin Buschmann (saxophone), Judith Jaenicke (flute) and Bob Lenox (Fender Rhodes piano). D√≥nal Lunny also overdubbed the fiddle parts and remixed the album at Lombard Studios in Dublin. Background In his online autobiography, Irvine recalls:Andy Irvine's autobiography ‚Äì Part 8. Retrieved on 7 March 2015 About the recording of Parallel Lines, Irvine added in a later interview: Retrieved on 2 April 2015. Recording of the original album \\"The Creggan White Hare\\" is a fairly modern ballad that Irvine learned from the singing of Vincent Donnelly from Castle Caulfield, Co. Tyrone, on an old BBC disc recorded in 1952 by Sean O'Boyle and Peter Kennedy. It relates the hunting of hares with greyhounds, a popular pastime in many rural areas in Ireland. However, \\"the white hare of Low Creggan was too smart for them all\\". \\"The Lads O' The Fair\\" / \\"Leith Docks\\". The first part, sung here by Gaughan, is a modern ballad written by Brian McNeill \\"(...) to commemorate a piece of his home town‚Äôs social history, the Falkirk Tryst, the great meeting at which the cattle of the Highlands, herded from the north by the drove roads, would be sold to southern buyers. (...) The song takes three characters; a weaver who wants to sell his cloth, a drover who‚Äôs looking forward to a good drink at the end of his work, and a ploughman who wants a new job, and it lets each of them tell of their expectations of the Tryst\\".Origin of \\"The Lads O' The Fair\\" at Brian McNeill's website. Retrieved on 8 March 2015 \\"Leith Docks\\" is a short instrumental coda composed by Gaughan and lasting approximately 20 seconds. \\"At Twenty-One\\" is the heartbreaking story of a poor young man who watches his sweetheart sail away after she gave her hand in marriage to a rich young man. Irvine learned it from the singing of Robert Cinnamond who lived on the banks of Lough Neagh, Co. Tyrone and who had many songs collected for the BBC by Sean Boyle in 1955. \\"My Back Pages\\" / \\"Afterthoughts\\". The first piece is Gaughan's interpretation of Bob Dylan's song. \\"The Dodger's Song\\" was first recorded by the Almanac Singers in 1942, which included Woody Guthrie. Irvine and Gaughan \\"added a few extra verses for good measure\\". \\"Captain Thunderbolt\\" is usually called \\"The Shannonside\\", but Irvine learned it from Tom Moran of Mohill, Co. Leitrim, who had changed it to \\"Lough Allen Side\\" to make it more localized. Captain Thunderbolt was a pseudonym often used by the United Irishmen around the time of the 1798 rising. \\"Captain Colston\\" is the story of a ship of poverty-stricken Irish emigrants being attacked by pirates on their voyage to the new world. However, Captain Colston's wife comes on deck \\"And with a pistol ball/She took the pirate captain's life\\". Irvine heard this song from Brigid Tunney and filled out the story from a longer version he learned from an old recording of Peter O'Donnell, also from Castle Caulfield, Co. Tyrone. \\"Floo'ers O' The Forest\\" is Gaughan's interpretation of \\"Flowers of the Forest\\", an ancient Scottish folk tune commemorating the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Two versions of the CD The original, 1982 vinyl LP was re-released twice on CD: * in 1990, on the German label Wundert√ºte Musik, as a direct transfer on CD of the original 8 tracks described above;Dick Gaughan & Andy Irvine - Parallel Lines on CD, Wundert√ºte Musik ~ T√úT 72.150, 1990. * in 1997, on the US label Appleseed Recordings, with the original 8 tracks--plus a bonus track of the 1980 recording of \\"Thousands Are Sailing To Amerikay\\", described below.Dick Gaughan & Andy Irvine - Parallel Lines on CD, Appleseed Recordings ~ Appleseed 1017, 1997. = Bonus track: \\"Thousand Are Sailing To Amerikay\\"= While most emigration ballads are in the first person and concern themselves with the general misfortune of leaving Ireland, this song is related by an observer and describes the emigrants' last night at home, the packing of trunks, the tearful farewell to friends, relations and neighbours, his journey to the train and the final heartbreak of pulling away from the shore. Irvine first heard a version of this song on a recording by Cathal McConnell and Robin Morton and afterwards, another version by Eddie Butcher from Magilligan, Co. Londonderry.Sleeve notes from Words & Music, WEA Ireland 240101 1, 1983. This version of the song was first recorded by Irvine and Gaughan during the Folk Friends 2 sessions in 1980. Irvine would re-record \\"Thousands Are Sailing to Amerikay\\" with Planxty in December 1982, for release--under the shorter title of \\"Thousands Are Sailing\\"--on their album Words & Music.

The Hualong One is the most common reactor design under construction in China, and the mainstream technology in the near future. China also plans to export the reactor.  Design  The Hualong One was developed by the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG) and the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) based on the ACPR1000 and the ACP1000 designs. Both are three-loop designs originally based on the same French M310 design. In early 2014 it was announced that the merged design was moving from preliminary design to detailed design. Power output will be 1170 MWe gross, 1090 MWe net, with a 60-year design life, and would use a combination of passive and active safety systems with a double containment.

On 19 January 2017 the United Kingdom Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) started their Generic Design Assessment process for the Hualong One, expected to be completed in 2021, in advance of possible deployment at the Bradwell nuclear power station site. On 16 November 2017 the ONR and the Environment Agency announced they are progressing to the next phase of their Generic Design Assessment of the UK HPR1000 reactor. Step 2 formally commenced on this day and is planned to take about 12 months. The targeted timescale for the UK HPR1000 GDA process is about five years from the start of Step 1.

He has produced several of the standard works on resistance and state repression in the German Democratic Republic (1949‚Äì1990). In 1955 he became one of several hundred kidnap victims of the East German Ministry for State Security, captured in West Berlin and taken to the east where for nearly five years he was held in state detention.More than 700 people were kidnapped in West Berlin and taken to the Communist Eastern zone of the city. See Falco Werkentin: Recht und Justiz im SED-Staat, 2nd edition, 1998, From 1970 till 1994 he worked for (West) Germany's national radio station where he was influential as a political commentator and as the broadcaster's editor for \\"East-West affairs\\". LifeKarl Oskar Fricke= His father was Karl Oskar Fricke. When the son was aged 16 his father was denounced by someone and arrested. The family lived at that time in what had recently become the Soviet occupation zone of what had formerly been Germany. Karl Oskar Fricke had worked as a teacher, journalist and photographer. During the Nazi years he had worked in the little town of Hoym as the head of a press office and a \\"deputy propaganda chief\\" of the local Party Group. He had also involved himself with the (Nazi) Teachers' Association and written for the Teachers' Association journal. Karl Oskar Fricke was taken into investigative custody in June 1946. After four years in the Buchenwald internment camp he faced a mass trial in the Waldheim mega-jail near Dresden. At the Waldheim Trials his turn lasted 30‚Äì40 minutes, before he was sentenced, along with another 3,400 internees processed in the space of a few weeks. He received a further twelve-year prison sentence. However, he died 1952 because of an outbreak of dysentery and flu at the Waldheim penitentiary.Karl Wilhelm Fricke in an Interview with Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk. In: Karl Wilhelm Fricke: Der Wahrheit verpflichtet, Ch. Links, Berlin 2000, p. 14ff. Available online in Geschichte betrifft uns (History affects us) 1/2006, PDF, 267 KB. =Two new Germanys= Karl Wilhelm Fricke was permanently affected by his father's fate. The son was unusual among his contemporaries in refusing to join the Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend), which was in effect the youth wing of the region's Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). The SED, formed only in April 1946, had already positioned itself as the ruling party, while the entire Soviet occupation zone had by October 1949 reverted to one- party government and redefined itself as the German Democratic Republic. Fricke's refusal to join the ruling party's youth wing left him with no opportunity formally to complete his secondary education. For a time he nevertheless worked as a language teaching assistant at the school where earlier his father had worked: there was a desperate shortage of Russian language teachers and Russian was the foreign language which Fricke had by now sufficiently mastered. Life as a teaching assistant came to an end on 27 February 1949 when he was arrested at the school by two policemen, after a colleague had denounced him for criticising the Russians. The charge he faced was the standard one of conspiracy to commit high treason. The police station in which he was held was a former villa that had not yet been converted and fortified, and he knew one of the arresting policemen from their childhoods. While awaiting the commissar responsible for processing his case he managed to escape. That night he crossed the (at that stage still relatively porous) frontier which by now separated East and West Germany. In 1949 the occupation zones that had been under US, British and French control had been merged to form the German Federal Republic (West Germany), formally founded in May, nearly half a year before the launch of the German Democratic Republic to the east. Fricke's first months in West Germany were spent in a succession of refugee camps, originally established to accommodate Germans made homeless by frontier changes mandated at the Potsdam conference, and now increasingly filled also by refugees escaping the former Soviet occupation zone. After about five months in the refugee camp at Hannover-Kirchrode, thanks to the intervention of an academic called Fritz Voigt, he was offered a stipendium and the chance to study at the Academy for Work, Politics and Economics which had been set up on the north-west German coast at Wilhelmshaven in May 1949, and where Voigt had a professorship. Fricke moved to Wilhelmshaven and started his studies at the end of the summer of 1949. A particular influence at Wilhelmshaven was Wolfgang Abendroth, a Marxist academic with a record of active opposition to Naziism who had nevertheless been persecuted in the German Democratic Republic and then expelled to the west when his ideas proved inconsistent with the objectives of the Soviet sponsored \\"Marxist\\" East German state. Fricke later recalled the impact on him of Abenroth's monthly informal seminars at Wilhelmshaven where students sat and discussed the works of Socialism's pre-Stalin heroes such as Rosa Luxemburg and Leon Trotsky. Fricke would remain at Wilhelmshaven till 1953. His father had worked as a school teacher with a side-line in journalism, but Karl Wilhelm Fricke had by now resolved to make journalism his principal career. When he received news of his father's death Fricke was still studying at Wilhelmshaven, but he was already making a career as a political journalist at the same time, with political repression in the new East German state a particular area of expertise because of his personal experience. While he always maintained a reputation for well-researched and accurate reporting, the circumstances of his father's death were clearly no random misfortune: they profoundly strengthened his opposition to what he later described as a governmental structure politically predicated not on the democratically expressed will of the people but on \\"systematic injustice\\".\\"...[es] hat mich nat√ºrlich best√§rkt in der Auffassung, nun wirklich zu ergr√ºnden, ist das ein zuf√§lliges Schicksal oder ist das systembedingtes Unrecht?\\" Before completing his time at Wilhelmshaven Fricke had already begun his relocation to West Berlin, then the brittle front-line between intellectually incompatible competing power blocs. In Berlin there was a rich stream of material for a free-lance political journalist: Fricke's career in print continued to progress, now complemented by excursions into radio-journalism. His themes included reports on the KgU, an anti-communist resistance group based in West Berlin, and he also reported on the UFS, a West Berlin-based human rights advocacy group widely believed to be funded and controlled by the CIA. These organisations were primarily devoted to tracking the persecution of government opponents through use of the \\"justice system\\" in the German Democratic Republic. In the German Democratic Republic itself Fricke's reports attracted far more interest than he would appreciate till much later. Officers of the recently established East Germany Ministry for State Security considered that his published articles, which they studied in close detail, were deeply damaging to the German Democratic Republic. =Abduction and imprisonment= Karl Wilhelm Fricke was kidnapped in West Berlin on 1 April 1955. Five days later State Security officials arrested his mother, Edith. Baited In the course of his researches Fricke came across a man called Kurt Maurer, a formerly Communist fellow-journalist who had spent time in a concentration camp during the Nazi years, and then following the war been interned by the Soviets. Fricke was intrigued by the man's complex political background and was keen to get to know him better. Also Maurer had somehow obtained access to a source of books in the German Democratic Republic which were helpful in the context of Fricke's journalistic investigations. Hooked On 1 April 1955 Fricke visited Maurer in his Berlin apartment to collect a book. Maurer was out, but his wife Anne-Marie was at home and offered Fricke a brandy. The third glass tasted odd, and after feeling unwell Fricke excused himself and went to vomit. Returning to the living room he still felt unwell and asked Mrs Maurer to call a taxi to take him home, before losing consciousness. Fricke himself was able to reconstruct the ensuing 24 hours only through the reports of others, but it seems that he was placed unconscious in a sleeping bag which was then concealed in a caravan and taken across the border into East Berlin. He had earlier mentioned his plan to visit Maurer to his fianc√©e, Friedelind M√∂hring, whom he had arranged to meet for dinner later that day. His disappearance was therefore quickly noticed and reported by his fianc√©e. Within a few hours Kurt Maurer was arrested, suspected of involvement in a kidnapping, but in the absence of better evidence against him, a West Berlin judge released him after 24 hours: meanwhile, across the city, Fricke was by now being interrogated without the benefit of a judge or even a lawyer being present. Kurt Mauer had not lied about his politically complicated past, but he had lied about his name, which was actually Kurt Rittwagen. His wife was Anne Marie Rittwagen. The Stasi knew him as \\"\\"IM Fritz\\". For Fricke, then still only 25 years old, they used the code-name \\"Student\\". Purpose The pattern of Stasi kidnappings in West Berlin was not advertised at the time, and only became fully apparent in retrospect. Years later it became clear that the abduction was carefully planned by the Stasi over many months. Three days before the abduction of Karl Wilhelm Fricke, its purpose was summarized by a Stasi officer called \\"Buchholz\\" in a memorandum that was opened up to a wider circle of researchers more than three decades later, after the Stasi archives had become accessible following reunification: :Subject: Fricke :The enemy activities of Fricke are that he obtained from persons in the German Democratic Republic documents and materials about leading Party Officers, leaders in the economy and of industry. [...] Furthermore, Fricke writes articles for the West German press. The purpose of arresting him is to identify and learn the methods by which our enemy sometimes succeeds in getting hold if the above mentioned items.BStU-Akte ZA, AOP 22/67, Bd. (Vol) V, Blatt (page) 207: 28 March 1955 Interrogation, verdict and sentence Imprisonment authorisation for Karl Wilhelm Fricke, dated 13 April 1955 (12 days after the abduction) and signed by Stasi chief, Erich Mielke. The document relates to \\"pre-trial\\" detention, so no term is specified, but the grounds for imprisonment are given as \\"Actions against the GDR\\". A succession of interrogation sessions over the next fifteen months ensued at the \\"Investigation Jail\\" at Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen. For most of that time Karl Wilhelm Fricke was held in solitary confinement and without access to any natural light. His interrogators were keen that he should name his illegal contacts in the German Democratic Republic, but they failed, according to Fricke, for the simple reason that there were none. After nineteen weeks his interrogators knew nothing of significance beyond what they had been told to know before their victim had even been kidnapped. \\"The guilty man [had] under the cover name \\"Student\\" undertaken extensive crimes against the German Democratic Republic.\\" Having gone to the trouble of abducting and interrogating him, however, there was little logic in releasing Fricke, and in July 1956 he came before the Supreme Court in order to be condemned in a secret trial to fifteen years in prison for \\"Agitating for wars and boycotts\\".\\"Kriegs- und Boykotthetze\\" The sentence was quite soon reduced to four years, which Fricke spent in solitary confinement at Brandenburg-G√∂rden and Bautzen II. Looking back from more than half a century later, in 2013 Fricke opined that he had been fortunate not to have been kidnapped and interrogated by the Stasi a couple of years earlier than he was. Joseph Stalin had died in March 1953, and East Germany underwent its own (violently suppressed) popular revolt later the same year. Khrushchev delivered one of the world's best remembered secret speeches in February 1956. Although it was not always immediately apparent, the political temperature in the power hubs of East Berlin and Moscow did become less nervous as the 1950s progressed, and there was an accompanying diminution in the savagery with which the regime treated its identified enemies. Fricke was released in 1959 and ordered back to West Berlin: he was content to comply. Mother During the same period Karl Wilhelm Fricke's mother Edith received a two-year prison term in February 1956. It was asserted that she had known about and supported her son's activities. =Back to work as a political journalist= After his release from prison in 1959 Fricke relocated to Hamburg and resumed his career as a free-lance journalist and writer. However, print journalism was progressively losing out to the broadcast media at this time, and West Germany's broadcasting industry was even more heavily concentrated on Cologne then than now. It was to Cologne that Fricke moved in 1970. Between 1970 and 1994 he worked as a senior (political) editor with Deutschlandfunk, the national radio station. From East Germany the Ministry for State Security continued to observe him. A Stasi internal paper from 1985 notes: :Fricke operates at Deutschlandfunk as head of the \\"East-west editorial\\" section. In his contributions and commentaries he slanders and distorts the political relationships in the German Democratic Republic (Party and state leadership, justice and sentencing). His books about the Stasi are intended to discredit the socialist security service internationally.BStU, MfS, ZA, HA II/13-322, Bl. 30.

He continued with them till 1994, the year of his 65th birthday. During the 1990s he also acted as an expert witness for two Bundestag formally constituted study commissions. One of these worked on the history and consequences of the one- party GDR dictatorship: the other looked at how to overcome the consequences of that one- party dictatorship in the ongoing unification process of which the \\"de jure\\" reunification of October 1990 was only one of many elements. For many years he also chaired the advisory boards of the Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen Memorial Museum and of the National Foundation for the Re-evaluation of the one-party GDR dictatorship. Evaluation Today Fricke's books are standard works in the field of resistance and opposition, criminal justice and national security in the former German Democratic Republic (1949‚Äì1990). In 2008 the senior East Germany scholar , himself a colleague of Fricke's at Deutschlandfunk (and previously a pupil of ) called Fricke the :[de facto] pope for resistance, opposition and oppression. When it comes to the subject of repression in [former] East Germany, Fricke has in effect covered the entire field single handedly. Whatever there was that needed saying [on the subject], Fricke has already published it.\\"Papst f√ºr Widerstand und Opposition und Unterdr√ºckung. Fricke hat das Thema Repression in der DDR tats√§chlich allein abgedeckt. Was zu sagen war, hat Fricke publiziert.\\" Awards and honours In 1996 the Free University of Berlin awarded Fricke an honorary doctorate for his work on political opposition in the former German Democratic Republic. In 2001 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (First class). In 2010 the Berlin- Hohensch√∂nhausen Memorial Supporters' Association honoured him with the Hohensch√∂nhausen Prize.

In the late 17th century amid a search for indigenous peoples to use in the slave trade, Portuguese colonists began to recognize the abundance of gold in the Amazon and catalyzed what would become the longest gold rush in history. Consequently, this flooded the area with prospectors from around the globe. Because of an already profitable agricultural operation taking place in the east, many Brazilians have been funneled into the jungle as part of several agricultural reform programs. Though the methods and practices have changed in the consequent centuries, the fact remains that the Amazon can yield tremendous quantities of gold for those who are willing to venture into the jungle. The work is often dangerous and detrimental to the surrounding ecosystems. Because artisanal mining is prohibited under federal mandates, the methods employed are often crude and unregulated resulting in polluted water and massive deforestation. The beginning During the 1690s in southeastern Colonial Brazil, when Portuguese colonists known as bandmasters roamed the countryside looking for indigenous peoples of Brazil to capture for the slave trade, gold was discovered. The discovery changed the history of eastern South America, expanded the use of indigenous and African slaves in the Portuguese colonial regions of the continent, and contributed to the borders of present- day Brazil. The bandmasters had found gold in the present day Mina Raiser region. Unlike other gold rushes in the world's history, the Brazilian Gold Rush lasted the longest, from the 1690s into the 19th century. In contrast to the 1840s‚àí1850s California Gold Rush, which helped the United States establish new \\"Industrial Revolution\\" era infrastructure, the Brazilian gold rush saw mass migration but little new non-mining infrastructure in the colony. Much like other gold rushes around the world of the era, the natural resources received notable environmental degradation from the mining process. What sets the Brazilian gold rush apart is that the consequences from losing environmentally crucial resources did not hinder the mining of gold. Between 1693 and 1720 some 400,000 Portuguese and 500,000 slaves had relocated to southeastern Brazil to mine gold. Such was the growth that, by 1725, half Brazil‚Äôs entire population was residing in Minas Gerais.[Davenport, J. (2012, October 12). The Brazilian Gold Rush.] The excitement of the thought of instant wealth brought many people to the mines. The Brazilian Gold Rush also provided a new excuse for slavery to thrive as thousands upon thousands were forced to do the work, while the slave/mine owners prospered. The Gongo Soco gold mine, operated by the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association of Cornwall using skilled Cornish miners and unskilled slaves, produced over of gold between 1826 and 1856. The initial Brazilian Gold Rush lasted up until the late 1800s. Those present day village residents known as garimpeiros still try to make a living from gold mining.  Brazil‚Äôs modern illicit gold mining industry  World production graph synonymous with growing global demand for gold. The necessity of the Amazon is indisputable, however, abuses of it and its natural resources persist in ways that are detrimental to the rain forest, the surrounding local communities, and the planet. Brazil‚Äôs illicit gold mining industry began to fully blossom in the 1950s consequently making the Amazon a focal point for the Brazilian Government. Up until this point, the traditional means of accessing the Amazon were via waterways, however, while this may have been somewhat sufficient for exploratory purposes, if the government were to extract resources in abundance then it would need a more fluid means of getting in and out. The solution to said dilemma was to build a network of roads and highways penetrating the forest, thus allowing not only mass-settlement in the region but also the opportunity to extract resources quickly and effectively. This was also seen as a way to prevent further migration in the south of Brazil, because highly successful agricultural operations were already underway and the government wanted to avoid any conflict between farmers in the region. Management of the rain forest's resources began to take shape with Brazil‚Äôs Agrarian Reform Program. The program, established in the 1970s, has since trans-located approximately 1.2 million settlers, mostly into Amazonian hinterlands. Available records indicate that between 1995 and 2011, 1,235,130 families had been trans-located into 8865 settlement projects, those of which account for roughly 10.3% of Brazil‚Äôs territory. Though only 13% of those families have been relocated to Amazonia, this program has still been heavily taxing on the Amazon. This is due, in large part, to the lackluster enforcement of environmental regulations by the government. Though Brazil‚Äôs Ministry of Agrarian Development presides over the land allocations and regulations that stipulate the rules landowners must adhere to, they fail in ensuring cooperation. For example, in an assessment from 1985-2001, of 4340 agrarian settlement projects, only 43% retained the mandated environmental buffer established by the ministry. Also, Brazil Amazonia reported the highest rates of illegal timber extraction. This results in a situation in which the Brazilian Environmental Agency (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov√°veis‚ÄîIBAMA) repeatedly fines the federal agrarian agency (Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria‚ÄîINCRA). Thus, there ensues a case in which government agencies that preside in overlapping jurisdictions fail to clearly define multilateral policy objectives, which ultimately produces inefficiencies. When this rural-rural migration took place, the land that the migrants were allotted was often infertile. Once they found that the land they were allowed to farm on was not yielding consistently, they saw the need to make use of the entirety of their allotment thus leading to the deforestation of the required riparian buffers. However, even after having made use of the entire plot, they did not realize any substantial production. It is this series of events that has led many to resort to illegal mining. Gold mining is explicitly illegal in the Amazon according to official federal mandates, however, it persists due to the lack of government oversight described earlier. One maneuver that gold prospectors have been employing is to pay local village leaders to ‚Äú‚Äòguide‚Äô‚Äù them through the local forests. Because the government does a poor job of patrolling the forest, the local chiefs are the informal gatekeepers and can essentially control who has permission to mine. This dynamic is a newer emergence, however. After the initial Amazonian development boom took place in the 1970s, many of the indigenous Amazonian tribes took action against the exploitation of the forest. These efforts largely took place in the 80‚Äôs and achieved marked success. Among the victories that local people enjoyed was a greater emphasis on the conservation of the forest itself and the limitation of mining. Many developers took little issue with the limitation of mining practices because at the time, the price of gold did not render it worth the hassle. Fast forward to today and the price has skyrocketed, thus making the risk worth the potential reward. Not only does mining in general contribute to deforestation, but the crude methods used in ‚Äòwildcat mining‚Äô, specifically, poison the ground and surrounding water supplies. However, while the market for gold in the Amazon is technically an illicit act, those who mine in the Amazon are simply meeting a real global demand. The global demand for gold rose in 2019 to 2,351 tonnes following increases from both, China and India respectively. Additionally, gold accumulation by official sectors rose 75% in 2018. Present-day miners and culture Brazilian miners, garimpeiros, came from all walks of life and corners of the country out to the Amazon rainforest to mine for gold. These men, much like the 49ers in California, ventured out on their own and mined the jungle without interference from the government or any other entity. Makeshift towns and enterprising people followed these men into the jungle. ‚ÄúIn all Garimpos there is a considerable floating population of non- garimpieros supplying goods and services; cooks, male and female prostitutes, mechanics, mule drivers, gold buyers, police troopers, traders, pilots, doctors, dentists, entertainers, photographers, and others‚Äù.[Cleary, D. (1990). Anatomy of the Amazon Gold Rush (First ed., p134, 212).] The culture that surrounds these camps is on one hand a brotherhood where every miner looks out for one another, however on the other hand it seems that it is survival of the fittest. ‚ÄúLife inside Garimpos is wild and anarchic. It sees other garimpieros as competitors rather than comrades. Gold is seen as fundamentally corrupting. It ignites greed and amorality in people who seem, and may even once have been, honest and likable‚Äù.[Cleary, D. (1990). Anatomy of the Amazon Gold Rush (First ed., p134, 212).] These makeshift pop-up towns seemed to resemble that of the Wild West in America, where the law was scarce, and a sense of Darwinism was established. Natural resources hang in the balance While the fleeting wealth brought all the Garampieros, they brought the destruction of the ecosystem. From the beginning up until the present day, miners are still looking for their wealth. The difference is that today‚Äôs technology vastly accelerates the mining process in the jungle, effecting double or triple the amount of land before. The recent popularity surge in gold mining is due to the unstable global economy over the past two decades. The price of gold has nearly tripled in that time. ‚ÄúResearchers from the University of Puerto Rico have shown that between 2001 and 2013, around of tropical forest was lost in South America as a result of gold mining, which increased from around to since the global economic crisis in 2007‚Äù.[Alvarez, N. (2015, January 13). Environmental Research Letters.] Gold mining in the Amazon rainforest has destroyed whole state-sized chunks of rainforest. However the destruction is not simply kept to where the mining is taking place. Mercury is used to purify gold in the Amazon. Unfortunately this toxic element has been reported downstream and poisoning the fish that fishermen catch and sell in the markets. This technique of separation, called amalgamation, is done without protective equipment and without any regulations to discard the mercury safely. Therefore, a massive amount of mercury has been flowing down the Amazon River since it first made its way into the hands of the miners. According to the University of Idaho, it is believed that gold mining contributes approximately 80% (168 tons annually) of mercury contamination.[Diaz, E. (2000, November 2). Mercury Pollution at the gold mining sites in the Amazon Environment.] Mercury has devastating effects on wildlife and ultimately to the people who ingest this deadly poison. It can harm the fetus of a pregnant mothers, which results in abnormal growth/malformation of the baby‚Äôs central nervous system. The two main sources of mercury contamination is the fish that these communities consume and how close to mining the individual is, more importantly the exposure to amalgamation. There are often harmful, societal by-products that mining has brought to communities near various operations. Among among such byproducts are: prostitution, drugs, alcohol abuse, and violence. For example, in 2017 the New York Times reported that 10 members of an ‚Äòuncontacted‚Äô Amazonian tribe had been murdered by gold miners near the Columbia border. Another negative aspect of mining is that it renders the land essentially useless for further use. Most of the mining that takes place in the Amazon is done via the aforementioned process known as ‚Äòwildcat mining‚Äô, in which miners essentially try their luck in different locations without sophisticated surveying technology. This results in a gritty operation through the use of hazardous technology such as explosive fertilizer and mercury, which ensures the capture of even the smallest pieces of gold. This poisons and degrades the surrounding soil and can pollute water sources up to one hundred miles away. Regarding the economy of illicit gold mining in particular, another issue is that the lack of regulation inhibits the government from being able to capture any rent from mining activities. The Amazon provides a number of ecosystem services. It is widely known that it is the world‚Äôs largest carbon sink, however, if it were to reach approximately 20-25% deforestation, this could be the tipping point at which it would no longer be a buffer against atmospheric carbon dioxide build-up. Currently, the Brazilian government estimates the current level of deforestation to sit at 19.3%. Also, the Amazon is responsible for about 16% of all oxygen produced on land alongside regulating weather patterns and mitigating climate change. Gold mining resurgence Many experts have speculated that ever since the global economy took a crash over 2 decades ago, gold‚Äôs worth has been on the rise ever since. ‚ÄúThe price of gold, which stood at $271 an ounce on September 10, 2001, hit $1,023 in March 2008, and it may surpass that threshold again. Gold's recent surge, sparked in part by the terrorist attack on 9/11, has been amplified by the slide of the U.S. dollar and jitters over a looming global recession‚Äù.[Larmer, B. (2009, January 1). The Real Price of Gold. National Geographic] This jump in gold prices was especially drastic in 2005 when the price continued to climb every year at a rate of nearly 200 dollars per year, which previously took over 160 years to achieve. This spike in price is an ominous warning to the global economy. However, this would explain why deforestation rates during the same period has reached an all-time high. Gold mining over the past five years in the Amazon however has taken a hit due to the unpopularity of gold.

The film focuses on Frank Wilson, the son of an inventor who has constructed a new airplane model. After failing to secure financing, his father suggests that he marry Rose, the daughter of his wealthy employer, to get the money they need. Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman, but he soon learns she does not love him. He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful. He returns to the aviation field and meets Rose again, after a successful flight she confesses to loving him. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park. One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in full flight. The film was released on November 25, 1910, but is now presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 26, 1910. It states: \\"Frank Wilson is the son of an inventor who has perfected an airship model in which Jack is greatly interested, but which neither of them have the money to finance. Wilson tries to interest his wealthy employer, Fisher, but is unsuccessful in the attempt. However he gains the support of his employer's beautiful daughter, Rose. The old inventor suggests to his son that if he marries Rose they could secure the money to perfect the invention. But Jack spurns the idea, as he is already engaged to marry a country girl, Daisy Lane, who, he believes, loves him devotedly. Upon learning that Daisy is a heartless coquette, Jack is heartbroken, and goes west to seek a fortune and forget her conduct. Success comes to him quickly, and he returns to tell his father that now, unaided, they can finance the invention. On the aviation field, Jack once more meets Rose, and confesses to her that it was the memory of her kindness that helped him achieve success. Jack makes a successful flight in the invention ‚Äì a new style of aeroplane ‚Äì and in offering her congratulations Rose confesses that she has loved him from the first.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. It is unknown when the film was shot, but the aviation meet may have been at Belmont Park in Long Island, New York. The second International Aviation Meet took place from October 22‚Äì30, 1910. One newspaper would state that a \\"one of the Wright Brothers' 1910 model flying machines\\" was shown in full flight. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 25, 1910. The film had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and Oklahoma, The New York Dramatic Mirror was neutral to slightly praising the production. The reviewer stated, \\"It is a discursive narrative, not bound by laws of cause and effect, although it does not contradict them. It is amusing to see the rapidity with which a motion picture hero goes West. He throws a toothbrush and his pajamas into a suitcase, takes his hat over his arm, and breaks the news to his father before stepping from the living room out into the street. The special point of this film is the aviation exhibition, which is well handled. The hero is a very jocose gentleman, who smiles broadly with and without provocation. Other parts are adequately filled.\\" The Moving Picture World spared three roughly three sentences surrounding the focus of the plot, \\"A love story built up around the invention of a new type of aeroplane. The machine flies and the inventor gets the girl of his choice. The picture has, therefore, a pleasant ending.\\" See also * List of American films of 1910  References  Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films ","title":"The Wild Flower and the Rose"},{"id":"45628577","text":"Gary V.

It has been paid for not by corporate funding or public grants, but by private donations. The theatre is the legacy of the Brighton showman and construction manager, Adrian Bunting, who died of pancreatic cancer, aged 47, in May 2013. In 2016, the Tatler placed the theatre in its list of the UK's six best outdoor theatres,Emma Beaumont, 'The UK's Best Outdoor Theatres', The Tatler, 13 May 2016 while the Guardian included it in the 'Top 10 outdoor cinema and theatre events in the UK'.Joanna Mason and Will Coldwell, 'Top 10 outdoor cinema and theatre events in the UK ', The Guardian, 9 July 2015 In 2017, the Brighton Open Air Theatre was number three in Curtain Call's list of the world's ten best outdoor theatres, after Shakespeare's Globe and Epidaurus.Curtain Call, 'Ten of the Best: Outdoor Theatres'6 June 2017 In 2019, B‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢T was number two in the Guardian's list of '10 great UK open-air theatres you can visit on public transport'Dixe Wills, '10 great UK open-air theatres you can visit on public transport', The Guardian, 6 August 2019 Adrian Bunting Adrian Bunting on Hove seafront in November 2012 Adrian Bunting was a buildings project manager, working on the refurbishment of the Brighton Dome and designing and project managing the construction of hotels in Africa and the Caribbean. He first became involved in theatre in the early 1990s, when he created and presided over Brighton's Zincbar Cabaret. His Guardian obituary recalls, 'The Zincbar, staged every fortnight at the Basement Club in the city, was a gloriously unpredictable crucible into which both gold and rubbish were thrown: comedians, poets and situationists alike. Adrian celebrated all, rousing the audience at the end of each act with: \\"Wasn't that magnificent?\\" Adrian Bunting promoting Kemble's Riot in Edinburgh in August 2012 In 1996, Bunting created the street theatre installation The World‚Äôs Smallest Theatre, which led to a well publicised battle with Marcel Steiner's Smallest Theatre in the World when both were programmed at the Pleasance in Edinburgh.David Bramwell, 'The battle between the world‚Äôs smallest theatres', The Stage, 10 June 2016 He was one of the founding members of the Upstairs Theatre Company and a regular performer with the Festival Shakespeare Company as well as a writer and performer of comedy and theatre. In 2011, he wrote, directed and produced the play Kemble's Riot, which cast the audience as rioters taking part in the 1809 Covent Garden Theatre Old Price Riots. The play won the Best Theatre award at the Brighton Festival that year and a five star review from Fringe Guru.Richard Stamp, 'Kemble's Riot' review, FringeGuru It went to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2012 and the New York Fringe in 2013. Bunting had a long-held ambition to create an open-air theatre for Brighton, and had even identified the perfect location, the bowling lawn on Dyke Road Park. In April 2013, when Bunting was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer, he learned that the bowling lawn was being closed by the council, which was looking for a new use for the space. Interviewed six days before his death, he said, 'The bowling lawn was always the place that I dreamed of. It's a magical place, with its own copse, hidden from the world....I always dreamed of putting it there. But of course it was a bowling lawn. You've heard about my unfortunate illness...(that) combining with the fact that the bowling green is no longer needed was too big a coincidence to think about. I really think that Brighton deserves an open-air theatre...that one of the most artistic towns in England can have a theatre that it can be proud of, alongside all the big beautiful theatres inside....And this is a chance for us to make one, and look after it, and enjoy it for the whole of the summer. This is when the tourists come, this is when people want to go outside, in June, July and August and watch great theatre.' The old bowling green in November 2013 In his last weeks, Bunting initiated the theatre designs and arranged for his life‚Äôs savings (¬£18,000) to be left to the project. He then brought together a team of five friends to help create it after his death. The BOAT team was made up of Steve Turner, construction manager, James Payne, television writer, Ross-Gurney-Randall, actor and playwright, Donna Close, Arts Manager and Producer, and Claire Raftery, theatre director. James Payne told etc magazine, 'If anyone else had asked, you would have said 'we will do our best' but couldn‚Äôt make any promises, but Adrian was one of those people, if he asked you would move heaven and earth for.' In March 2015, Bunting was one of 24 celebrated Brightonians honoured by having their names on the front of the new bus fleet. His friend, Dan Wilson said, 'There are few greater Brightonian accolades than having your name on a bus and Adrian would have been delighted.'Jo Wadsworth, 'Inspirational playwright among latest city greats to be given bus honour', Brighton and Hove News, 27 March 2015 Winning Support Creating a theatre was a long and difficult process. The BOAT team first had to win the backing of the local community organization, The Friends of Dyke Road Park; to register BOAT as a charity; and to secure planning permission from Brighton and Hove Council. Fund Raising BOAT supporters organised several fund- raising events. The biggest was the BOAT benefit at the Dome, on 16 June 2013, featuring Stewart Lee, Tim Vine, Simon Evans, Joanna Neary, Mark Thomas and Susan Murray as MC. James Payne told etc. magazine, 'Adrian gave such a lot when he was alive. People feel they owe him so they came and performed for free. The benefit raised over ¬£20,000 doubling our funds over night.' The Dome show was followed by a Zincbar Reunion evening in the Spiegeltent, as part of Brighton Fringe on 23 May 2014. Performers from the original Zincbar cabaret, many of whom had not been on stage in years, revived their old acts. A third benefit, 'Toast the Boat', was held at The Old Market, Hove, in December to celebrate the granting of planning permission. Acts included Simon Evans, Tom Binns (who first performed at Zincbar), Susan Murray and MC Guy Venables, joined by many original Zincbar performers. In March 2015, there was an online auction, BidforBoat, in which dozens of artists donated more than 60 works to be sold for the theatre. The artists who contributed include the cartoonists, Chris Riddell and Guy Venables; the comic/graphic novels illustrator, Clint Langley; the designer, Cressida Bell; the film director, Darren Walsh; the oil painter, Sam Hewitt; and the television writer, Graham Duff. The auction raised ¬£13,605.59. The Acoustic Wall of the theatre carries this memorial plaque Apart from the big fundraising events, there were many other generous donations. The Crescent pub at 6 Clifton Hill raised more than ¬£1,000 from its regular quiz for BOAT. The Crescent was Bunting's favourite pub, and he often took part in the quiz, as well as performing as occasional quizmaster. The Theatre The theatre's final design was the work of the architect, Graeme Hawkins, of the Miller Bourne partnership, who offered his services for free. BOAT resembles a classical Greek theatre, with semi-circular banks of seating looking down at a performance space. Its lawned terraces, with seating for 425 audience members, lead down to a sunken flat thrust lawned stage. A concrete sound wall behind the stage provides an acoustic cushion and a back stage wall for exits and entrances. Programming Policy According to the BOAT website, the theatre 'will operate from the beginning of May to the end of September each year and will provide a space for local artists alongside national touring productions. The programme will primarily be theatre and spoken word but will also include screenings and public talks. Uniquely the exact programme will be chosen by lottery to ensure that it remains accessible and open to all comers.' James Payne told Viva magazine, 'Adrian's artistic policy was that there is no artistic policy. He wanted everyone to have a chance.' Launching the BOAT Isobelle Bunting launches the BOAT BOAT opened on 9 May 2015, with a gala night, featuring Flick Ferdinando, Nick Pynn, Joanna Neary, Richard Durrant, Simon Evans, Steve Wrigley, Glenn Richardson, Dan Atkinson and the Brighton Early Musical Community Choir (with which Bunting sang). The theatre was formally launched by Adrian's mother, Isobelle Bunting. Flick Ferdinando comperes the gala opening Since the opening of the theatre, the venue has been used to stage further fund-raising events. Boost the Boat, on 3 July 2015, was an evening of stand-up comedy, starring Tim Vine, Shane Richie, Simon Evans, Joanna Neary, and George Egg. 2015 Programme The first production staged was Romeo and Juliet from Shakespeare's Globe, from 13‚Äì16 May, as part of Brighton Festival. In May, the BOAT team announced the appointment of the playwright, Brian Mitchell, a close friend of Bunting's, as Manager of the theatre. For the summer of 2015, Mitchell programmed Radio City Theatre, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Twelfth Night, Our Mutual Friend, The Eunuch, As You Like It, Madame Butterfly, Iolanthe, Hamlet, the Nettle Knickers Puppet Show, Trumpton Comes Alive!(a musical celebration of Trumpton), The Tragedian, Prodigal Theatre's trilogy about Edmund Kean, Shakespeare in a Day, The Brighton Beach Boys, and Kemble's Riot.

With limited funds for marketing it's a remarkable figure.'Posting on the BOAT facebook page, 13 September 2015 2016 Programme In 2016, Anne-Marie Williams took over from Mitchell as the new manager of BOAT.

This was a '20-minute piece... specifically designed for the canine ear, including frequencies audible only to dogs'Brighton Festival Programme listing for Music for Dogs The show, performed to an audience of around 100 dogs and their owners, was pronounced a 'howling success' by the Argus.Joel Adams, 'Music for Dogs is a Howling Success', The Argus, 11 May 2016('Performances greeted by howls rarely receive five star reviews, but when they are accompanied by wagging tails and barks of approval the show‚Äôs rating goes without saying.') On 19 June, the theatre was the setting for Lifeboat, a family fundraiser for refugees. The money raised went to the School Bus Project, converting buses into mobile schools to provide teaching in the Calais Jungle Camp. In July 2016, BOAT hosted the Starboard Festival, a new festival of outdoor performance by, for and with children and young people from 0 to 21. Over 16 days, 20 different shows were staged, as well as workshops in playwriting and performing. Festival founder Naomi Alexander told the Latest that she was inspired by seeing a show at BOAT: 'I wanted to do something that would enable children and young people in the city to discover this magic for themselves and for BOAT to become part of their psychogeography of the city.''Starboard Festival showcases the magic of Brighton Open Air Theatre for children', The Latest, 11 July 2016 2017 Programme In 2017, the comedian Simon Evans joined BOAT as a patron, and also hosted BARKING! a stand-up comedy show for dogs.

The first Grounds for Coffee shop opened in Salt Lake City in 1989. The business currently operates as a franchise owned by Dan and Suzy Dailey, with multiple shops located in Ogden, Layton, and Sunset, Utah. One independently owned shop also operates under the Grounds for Coffee name in Clearfield, Utah. Grounds for Coffee also operates a mail-order business via its website, selling fresh roasted coffee beans. Grounds for Coffee in Ogden, Utah, on historic 25th St. Grounds for Coffee in Ogden, Utah, on Harrison Blvd. Grounds for Coffee in Ogden, Utah, at the Wisebird Bookery location on Harrison Blvd. Grounds for Coffee in Clearfield, Utah Grounds for Coffee in Layton, Utah on Highway 89  History  Grounds for Coffee opened its first location approximately 1989 adjacent to Liberty Park in Salt Lake City. The original owners (Bendt and Sandra Johnson) operated as a licensed retail coffee business and roaster. By the early 1990s they had nine separately owned and operated locations mostly in Salt Lake City, with a shop in both Ogden and Clearfield which carried their name, drink recipes, and line of roasted coffee beans. By the mid- to late 90s the Johnsons closed the roasting operation and left Utah. This left each existing shop to operate as an individual location. One by one they mostly closed with the exception of the shop at 3005 Harrison Blvd., Ogden owned and operated by Dan & Suzy Dailey and the Clearfield shop owned and operated by Pam McLaughlin at 375 South State St. (Lakeside Square), in Clearfield. It was at this point in time that Dan and Suzy Dailey acquired the trademarked logo and Grounds for Coffee name. They restructured the operation from a licensed business to a franchise. With only the two existing locations, Pam McLaughlin was invited but declined the offer to operate under the new franchise. She continues to operate independently from, and amicably with, the Daileys today. In 1991, Grounds for Coffee had a coffee shop at 4881 South Redwood Road in Salt Lake City owned by Lew and Holly, which is now the location of another coffee house called Hidden Peaks Gourmet, located a few blocks from the Salt Lake Community College. In 1996 Grounds for Coffee experimented with setting up a \\"Cappucino Corner\\" located on the Salt Lake Community College campus on Redwood Road.  Locations  As of April 2015 eight coffee shops operate under the Grounds for Coffee franchise. They are: * 3005 Harrison Blvd., Ogden UT 84403, opened by Dan & Suzy Dailey on January 15, 1992 * 1480 Hwy. 89, Layton UT 84404, opened by Jennifer Zeemer in 2000 And purchased by Tim & Teri Ohrenberger in 2009 * 111 Historic 25th Street, Ogden UT 84401, opened in 2004 By Dan & Suzy Dailey and taken over operationally by Sadie Clifford in 2009. This location includes a Bake Shop * McKay-Dee Hospital Center, Ogden UT coffee kiosk opened by Dan and Suzy Dailey in the original hospital site in 1999 and relocated to the new hospital in 2002 * 4101 Riverdale Rd, Riverdale UT 84405 opened by Sadie Clifford Gleave in October 2012, this location closed in August 2015 * 2853 North Main St. Sunset UT opened by Dan & Suzy Dailey in January 2014 * Ogden Regional Medical Center UT opened by Sadie Clifford in December 2015 * 157 North Commercial St. Morgan UT opened by Adam & Shauna Walker in March 2016 Grounds for Coffee franchised locations include full service, sit down coffee shops, drive-thrus, and a scaled down kiosk model. Each are independently owned and operated. The franchise does not operate with a top-down oriented chain of command. Each shop owner makes decision regarding interiors, product line, peripheral products, hours, and pricing. The unifying and consistent attributes of each shop are: the coffee & espresso based drink menu, ingredients and recipes, and an emphasis on customer service and community integration. Every GFC location appears as a local, independent business reflecting the tastes and preferences of the unique market place and clientele. GFC is a strong supporter of the Buy Local movement. Every shop participates in many community related events and fundraisers. Like all locally owned independent businesses the monies spent and tax dollars collected stay within the local economies they serve.  Honors  In October 2012, Indie Ogden in Utah awarded Grounds for Coffee as the Best Local Coffee.  Community  Grounds for Coffee is known for its community presence, sponsoring and partnering with many local businesses and events. The 30th and Harrison location regularly held shows by artists' work from Weber State University. There was an occasion however in 1994, where the management at that time had determined that the subject matter was too offensive for some patrons, and remove those which contained paintings and photographs of nudity. On \\"Make a Difference Day\\" held on May 12, 2011, and also on May 10, 2012 included notable partners the McKay-Dee Hospital Center, the LDS Church, the Ogden School District, the Ogden Nature Center, the Utah Transit Authority, the YMCA, the Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services and the Keller Williams Realty. It is a member of Local First Utah, a network of many local businesses and non-profits that emphasizes the importance of buying local products. In 2014, the Clearfield location participated in their first \\"Coffee with a Cop\\" meeting, giving the citizens a chance to find out what is happening with the local police department, and provide some feedback as well.

A talented age group thrower, Accambray set a world junior record in men's hammer throw in 1969. During the early 1970s he studied at Kent State University in Ohio, winning NCAA championship titles in both hammer throw and weight throw. He represented France as a hammer thrower at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics, as well as at the European Championships of 1969, 1971, 1974 and 1978. From 1985 to 1996 he was President of the French American Football Federation. Biography Accambray was born in Divion, Pas-de-Calais on 23 May 1950. He developed rapidly as a hammer thrower; in June 1968 he threw 64.40 m in a dual meet against West Germany, setting a new French junior record. On 31 May 1969 he threw 68.24 m in Sochaux, breaking the world junior mark; the throw placed him 21st in the world that year among throwers of any age. Accambray was selected to represent France at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens, but only managed 60.76 m and was eliminated in the qualification round. He won his first French national championship title that summer, repeating as champion the following year. For the next four years Accambray studied at Kent State University in Ohio, continuing his throwing career there. Accambray and his Kent State teammate Al Schoterman were the top collegiate heavy throwers of the early 1970s; in 1971, Accambray placed second to Schoterman in the 35 lb weight throw at the Division I indoor championships and won the hammer throw, with Schoterman taking second, in the outdoor meet; Accambray's winning mark of 227 ft 10 in (69.44 m) was a new collegiate and meeting record. Accambray and Schoterman reversed roles in 1972, with Accambray winning the NCAA weight throw title and Schoterman the hammer throw; again, they claimed the top two in both events. Accambray's winning mark in the weight throw, 71 ft 3 in (21.71 m), broke Schoterman's meeting record from the previous year. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich Accambray cleared the qualification with a throw of 68.00 m, but in the final he only managed 65.06 m and placed 19th. With Schoterman no longer in college, Accambray regained the NCAA hammer title in 1973. Accambray won his second collegiate indoor weight throw title in 1974, throwing 71 ft in (21.91 m); the mark was a new collegiate and meeting record, and remained Kent State record until Matthias Tayala broke it in 2014. Accambray also won the 1974 United States weight throw championship, defeating four-time defending champion George Frenn. In his final year at Kent State, he joined the university's American football team as a defensive tackle; after his graduation in 1974 he was signed by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, but although he visited the Alouettes' training and selection camp he never played a game for them. Accambray became French hammer throw champion for a third time in 1975, throwing a meeting record 69.76 m. He won bronze with 65.16 m at the 1975 Mediterranean Games. Accambray achieved his best results in 1976, winning his fourth French title with 69.86 m; at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal he threw 70.44 m for ninth place, his best placing in a major international meet. He set his final personal best (and French record), 73.46 m, in Antony on 23 June 1976. At the 1978 European Championships in Prague Accambray was again eliminated in the qualification round. He won his fifth and final French national title in 1979. From 1985 to 1996 he was President of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Football Am√©ricain (FFFA), France's national federation of American football. Personal life Accambray's wife, Isabelle Accambray (n√©e Reynaud), was French national champion in women's discus throw from 1980 to 1982. Handball international William Accambray is their son.

Background King Tribhuvan's anti Rana attitude had been an open secret for long in Nepal. In November 1950, King Tribhuvan took refuge at the Indian Embassy against the Ranas. He was accompanied by his son Mahendra and the eldest grandson Birendra, among others. On 10 November, two Indian planes landed at Gauchar Airport and flew back to New Delhi with the Royal family excluding the infant King, Gyanendra. King Tribhuvan was formally welcomed by the Indian prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru and other high officials. Provisions The major provisions of the Delhi Accord (Agreement) are as follows: *An elected constituent assembly will frame a democratic constitution within 2 years. *There will remain an interim cabinet (government) of 10 ministers under the Prime Ministership of Mohan Shumsher of which 5 will be taken from the Nepali congress. *There will be no restriction to open political organizations. All the political prisoners will be set free and agitators have to hand over all the weapons to the government and stop the movement. *King Tribhuvan will remain the King of Nepal and ultimate power lies in the monarch. Aftermath On 15 February 1951, King Tribhuvan and the leading members of the Nepali Congress returned to Kathmandu. Huge flock of supporters gathered and welcome their monarch at the airport. On 18 February 1951, King Tribhuvan announced Nepal‚Äôs first steps to democracy with a historical proclamation. According to the Delhi accord coalition government was formed.

Officially unveiled on March 9 and launched on April 7, 2015 the service allows subscribers on-demand access to HBO's library of original programs, films and other content on personal computers, smartphones, tablet devices and digital media players. Unlike HBO Go, HBO's online video on demand service for existing subscribers of the linear television channel, HBO Now is available as a standalone service and does not require a television subscription to use, targeting cord cutters who use competing services such as Netflix and Hulu. As of February 2018, HBO Now had 5 million subscribers. The service was succeeded on May 27, 2020 by HBO Max, a superset of HBO Now with a broad array of content from Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. properties, and other third-party content. Most HBO and HBO Now subscribers were migrated to HBO Max at no additional cost, although some providers ‚Äî such as Amazon and Roku ‚Äî did not reach such agreements. The HBO Now service remains available for these users, but its apps have since been rebranded as \\"HBO\\". Development On October 15, 2014, following a trial of a similar service in Nordic Europe, HBO announced plans to launch an online, subscription video on demand service in the United States in 2015. This new service would be geared towards cord cutters ‚Äì consumers who primarily use online video services to view television programs rather than subscribe to cable or satellite television ‚Äì and would not have to be purchased as part of a television subscription, therefore also making it a competitor to services such as Netflix. This contrasts with HBO's existing online video on demand service, HBO Go, which is only accessible to those who have subscribed to HBO through a television provider. Former HBO Now logo, used from April 7, 2015 until July 31, 2020. On December 9, 2014, it was reported that HBO had outsourced development of the service's infrastructure to Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM), who also developed the infrastructures used by WatchESPN and WWE Network. The network was previously working on a new platform codenamed \\"Maui\\"; however HBO, especially after major outages of HBO Go that occurred during several recent season premieres of high-profile HBO series, felt that outsourcing the service to a third-party would bring lower risk to the project. Otto Berkes stepped down as the company's Chief Technical Officer following this move. The service was officially unveiled as HBO Now during an Apple press event on March 9, 2015. It was also announced that Apple would be the service's exclusive launch partner, with the HBO Now app being exclusive to Apple TV and iOS devices for a three-month period following the service's launch. HBO Now content can also be accessed on its website. HBO Now officially went live on April 7, 2015, to coincide with the April 12 premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones. Apple keeps 15% of the monthly subscription fee from users who sign up from an iOS device. Following the end of the exclusivity period, HBO Now for Android and Amazon Kindle Fire was released on July 16, 2015. HBO Now apps for Xbox 360 and Xbox One were released on April 21, 2016. On September 15, Sony announced that HBO Now will be available on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, which was later released on September 29, 2016 in anticipation for the series premiere of Westworld on October 2, and that anyone that subscribed to HBO on PlayStation Vue would be able to access HBO Now at no extra cost.Dwayne Benefield.

Like with HBO Go, HBO Now strictly serves as a video on demand service and does not include access to near-real-time streams of HBO's linear channels ‚Äì unlike similar (in particular, TV Everywhere) streaming services offered by other television networks. HBO Now also does not include programming streams or content from sister premium service Cinemax; while there is no similar standalone service for Cinemax, its programming is also available through selected vMVPD services including Hulu + Live TV, Prime Video Channels, and the Apple TV app. Availability HBO Now is only available to customers in the United States and certain U.S. territories. Due to regional rights restrictions, HBO cannot offer the service outside of the country, and its terms of use explicitly forbid the service from being used outside the United States. Users from outside the U.S. that are detected to have used services such as virtual private networks (VPN) to evade the geo-blocking to use HBO Now are subject to have their services terminated with no refund. In many other countries, HBO has licensed exclusive rights to its programming to television networks owned by third parties, including Bell Media's Crave (formerly The Movie Network, and including an HBO-branded multiplex channel) and Super √âcran in Canada, and Sky Atlantic in the United Kingdom. In these cases, HBO has left it up to individual rightsholders to decide whether to offer its programming on an over-the-top basis. In Canada, the Crave OTT streaming service launched a version with current HBO programming in November 2018, well after the launch of HBO Now. On April 1, 2015, as part of an agreement with Time Warner that renewed its carriage contract for the Turner Broadcasting System networks and gave its over-the-top television service Sling TV distribution rights to the linear HBO channel, Dish Network secured an option to become a distribution partner for HBO Now following the exclusivity period with Apple.

The daffodil is the national flower of Wales associated with St. David's Day. In other cultures it many be associated with wealth, good fortune and beauty. Because of the time that it flowers it is also a symbol of Spring, and associated religious festivals such as Easter, hence the use of Lent lily or in German, Easter bells, amongst its common names. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is also associated with festivals in many places. While prized for its ornamental value, there is also an ancient cultural association with death, at least for pure white forms. Historically the narcissus has appeared in written and visual arts since antiquity, being found in graves from Ancient Egypt. In classical Graeco-Roman literature the narcissus is associated with both the myth of the youth who was turned into a flower of that time, and with the Goddess Persephone, snatched into the underworld as she gathered their blooms. Narcissi were said to grow in meadows in the underworld. In these contexts they frequently appear in the poetry of the period from Stasinos to Pliny. In western European culture narcissi and daffodils are among the most celebrated flowers in English literature, from Gower to Day-Lewis, while the best known poem is probably that of Wordsworth. In the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological, floral art, or landscapes, from mediaeval altar pieces to Salvador Dal√≠. The narcissus also plays an important part in Eastern cultures from their association with the New year in Chinese culture to symbolising eyes in Islamic art. The word 'Daffodil' has been used widely in popular culture from Dutch cars to Swedish rock bands, while many cancer charities have used it as a fundraising symbol.  Symbols  N. triandrus 'Thalia', considered a grave flower The daffodil is the national flower of Wales, where it is traditional to wear a daffodil or a leek on Saint David's Day (March 1). In Welsh the daffodil is known as \\"Peter's Leek\\", (cenhinen Bedr or cenin Pedr), the leek (cenhinen) being the other national symbol. The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or Newroz in the Kurdish culture. The narcissus is perceived in the West as a symbol of vanity, in the East as a symbol of wealth and good fortune (see Eastern cultures). In classical Persian literature, the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes, together with other flowers that equal a beautiful face with a spring garden, such as roses for cheeks and violets for shining dark hair. In western countries the daffodil is associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter. In Germany the wild narcissus, N. pseudonarcissus, is known as Osterglocke or \\"Easter bell.\\" In the United Kingdom, particularly in ecclesiastical circles, the daffodil is sometimes variously referred to as the Lenten or Lent lily.Rarely \\"Lentern\\", especially ecclesiastical usage as here, or dialect, particularly Scottish Tradition has it that the daffodil opens on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, and dies at Easter which marks the end of Lent. Although prized as an ornamental flower, some people consider narcissi unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune, and hence refuse to have them in the house. White narcissi are especially associated with death, especially the pure white N triandrus 'Thalia', and hence are considered grave flowers. Indeed, in Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs. Robert Herrick, describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld (see The Arts, below). The artsAntiquity= N. tazetta growing in Israel Demeter and Persephone surrounded by daffodils - \\"Demeter rejoiced, for her daughter was by her side\\" Narcissi have been used decoratively for a long time, a wreath of white-flowered N. tazetta having been found in an ancient Egyptian grave, and in frescoes on the excavated walls of Pompeii. It is thought to have been mentioned in the Bible, for instance in the Book of Isaiah. The rose mentioned here being the original translation into English from the Biblical Hebrew word chabatstsileth (). This so-called \\"Rose of Sharon\\" being actually a bulbous plant, probably N. tazetta which grows in Israel on the Plain of Sharon, where it is a protected plant. They make a frequent appearance in classical literature.  Greek culture  The narcissus has also frequently appeared in literature and the visual arts, and forms part of two important Graeco-Roman myths, that of the youth Narcissus () who was turned into the flower of that name, and of the Goddess Kore, or Persephone (; ) daughter of the goddess Demeter (), snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades () while picking narcissi. Hence, the narcissus is listed as having been sacred to both Hades and Persephone, and to grow along the banks of the river Styx (Œ£œÑœçŒæ) in the underworld. The Greek poet Stasinos (, flourished ca. 800 ‚Äì 900 BC) mentioned them in the Cypria (ŒöœÖœÄœÅŒØŒ±) in which he sings of the flowers of the island of Cyprus. The legend of Persephone comes to us primarily in the anonymous seventh century BC Homeric Hymn To Demeter (Œï·º≤œÇ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ±ŒΩ),. In the opening scene, the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she later recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for; \\"ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∫ŒπœÉœÉœåŒΩ Œ∏·æΩ, ·ΩÉŒΩ ·ºîœÜœÖœÉ·æΩ ·Ω•œÇ œÄŒµœÅ Œ∫œÅœåŒ∫ŒøŒΩ Œµ·ΩêœÅŒµ·øñŒ± œáŒ∏œéŒΩ\\" (l. 428) \\"and the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow as a crocus\\". Other Greek authors making reference to the narcissus include Sophocles (, c. 497 ‚Äì 406 BC) and Plutarch (, c. 46 AD ‚Äì 120 AD). Sophocles, in his Oedipus at Colonus (Œü·º∞Œ¥ŒØœÄŒøœÖœÇ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ ŒöŒøŒªœâŒΩ·ø∑) utilises narcissus in a highly symbolic manner, implying fertility, and allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore (Persephone) (ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ±ŒπŒΩ Œ∏ŒµŒ±ŒØŒΩ, the Great Goddesses), but by extension through the Persephone association, a symbol of death. Jebb comments here that ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∫ŒπœÉœÉŒøœÇ is the flower of imminent death with its fragrance being ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∫Œ∑ or narcotic, emphasised by its pale white colour. Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom, the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his death. Plutarch refers to this in his Symposiacs as follows, \\"and the daffodil, because it benumbs the nerves and causes a stupid narcotic heaviness in the limbs, and therefore Sophocles calls it the ancient garland flower of the great (that is, the earthy) gods.\\" This reference to Sophocles' \\"crown of the great Goddesses\\", here is the source of the commonly quoted phrase in the English literature \\"Chaplet of the infernal Gods\\" incorrectly attributed to Socrates. A passage by Moschus' (, fl. 100 BC) has been incorrectly attributed to Theocritus (, fl. c. 150 BC). Moschus describes fragrant narcissi (ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∫ŒπœÉœÉŒøŒΩ ·ºêŒ∞œÄŒΩŒøŒøŒΩ) in his Idylls (Œï·º∞Œ¥œçŒªŒªŒπŒ±), \\"Now the girls so soon as they were come to the flowering meadows took great delight in various sorts of flowers whereof one would pluck sweet breathed narcissus\\" (Europa and the Bull), See also John Gerard's verse translation: and narcissi were said to have been part of Europa's floral headdress. Another Greek writer, Homer (, ca. 7th century BC), in his Odyssey (·ΩàŒ¥œçœÉœÉŒµŒπŒ±), in several places (e.g. Od. 11:539; 24.14) described the underworld as having Elysian meadows (·º®ŒªœçœÉŒπŒøŒΩ œÄŒµŒ¥ŒØŒøŒΩ) carpeted with flowers, though using the term asphodel (·ºÄœÉœÜŒøŒ¥ŒµŒª·Ω∏ŒΩ), hence Asphodel Meadows. This may have actually been narcissus, with its associations with the underworld, as described by Theophrastus (), and frequently used in later literature to refer to daffodils.The Asphodel of the Greek underworld has been variously associated with the white Asphodelus ramosus () or the yellow Asphodeline lutea (), previously classified as Asphodelus luteus A similar account is provided by Lucian (, c. 125 ‚Äì 180 AD) in his Necyomantia or Menippus (ŒúŒ≠ŒΩŒπœÄœÄŒøœÇ ·º¢ ŒùŒµŒ∫œÖŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ±), describing asphodel in the underworld (Nec. 11:2; 21:10). The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias (, c. 110 ‚Äì 180AD) in his Description of Greece (·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒÆŒ≥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ). Pausanias, deferring to Pamphos, believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus, and hence discounts the idea the flower was named after the youth.  Roman culture  Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70 BC ‚Äì 19 AD), the first known Roman writer to refer to the narcissus, does so in several places, for instance twice in the Georgics, Book four, l. 122 \\"nec sera comantem Narcissum\\" (nor had I passed in silence the late-flowering narcissus) In and l. 159 \\"pars intra septa domorum, Narcissi lacrymam\\" (some within the enclosure of their Hives, lay Narcissus' tears). Virgil refers to the cup shaped corona of the narcissus flower, allegedly containing the tears of the youth Narcissus. In Milton makes a similar analogy in his Lycidas \\"And Daffodillies fill their Cups with Tears\\". Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the Eclogues. In the second book l. 48 \\"Narcissum et florem jungit bene olentis anenthi\\" (joins the narcissus and flower of sweet-smelling anise), In also the fifth book, l. 38 \\"pro purpureo narcisso\\" (in lieu of the empurpled narcissus). In For the idea that narcissus could be purple, see also Dioscorides (ŒµœÄ ŒµŒΩŒØœâŒΩ Œ¥Œµ œÄŒøœÅœÜœÖœÅŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ≠œÇ) In and Pliny (sunt et purpurea lilia). In This was thought to be an allusion to the purple-rimmed corona of N. poeticus. In Finally, in the eighth book of the Eclogues, Virgil writes, l. 53 \\"narcisso floreat alnus\\" (the alder with narcissus bloom). In Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso, 43 BC ‚Äì 17 AD) was also familiar with narcissi, in his recounting of the self-loving youth who is turned into the flower, in the third book of his Metamorphoses l. 509 \\"croceum pro corpore florem inveniunt, foliis medium cingemtibus albis\\" (They came upon a flower, instead of his body, with white petals surrounding a yellow heart) and also the fifth book of his Fasti l. 201 \\"Tu quoque nomen habes cultos, Narcisse, per hortos\\" (You too, Narcissus, were known among the gardens). This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just Narcissus, for instance see crocus (Krokus), laurel (Daphne) and hyacinth (Hyacinthus). He also advocated the use of the bulb of the narcissus as a cosmetic, in his Medicamina Faciei Femineae (Cosmetics for the Female Face), ll. 63‚Äì64 \\"adice narcissi bis sex sine cortice bulbos, strenua quos puro marmore dextra terat\\" (add twelve narcissus bulbs after removing their skin, and pound them vigorously on a pure marble mortar). = Western culture = 30px Although there is no clear evidence that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus, for instance Elizabeth Kent (Flora Domestica, 1823), FW Burbidge (The Narcissus, 1875), Peter Barr (Ye Narcissus Or Daffodyl Flowere, 1884), and Henry Nicholson Ellacombe (The Plant-lore & Garden-craft of Shakespeare, 1884). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors including John Gower, Spenser, Constable, Shakespeare, Addison and Thomson, together with Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. In An example of this is Gower's retelling of Ovid's Metamorphoses : Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579), \\"Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies\\". Constable compares the object of affection to the daffodil, Shakespeare, who frequently uses flower imagery, refers to daffodils twice in The Winter's Tale (Autolycus act iv, sc. 3(1) \\"When Daffodils begin to peer\\" and Perdita act iv, sc. 4(118) \\"Daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty\\" 1623)., and also in The Two Noble Kinsmen (act iv, sc. 1(94) \\"chaplets on their heads of Daffodillies\\" 1634). However Shakespeare also uses the term 'Narcissus' in the latter (act ii, sc. 2(130) \\"What flowre is this? Tis called Narcissus, madam\\"). Robert Herrick, in Hesperides (1648) alludes to their association with death in a number of poems such as To Daffadills (\\"Faire Daffadills we weep to see, You haste away so soone\\") In and Divination by a Daffadill; Among the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth's short 1804 poem I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (The Daffodils) which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image, here associated with vitality and pleasure. Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems, such as Foresight. In Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister, Dorothy is just as poetic, if not more so, just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of first section of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (see Greek culture, above); Among their contemporaries, Keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing 'joy for ever'; while Shelley looks back to the legend in his description of the flower; A. E. Housman, using one of the daffodil's more symbolic names (see Symbols), wrote the Spring poem The Lent Lily in his collection A Shropshire Lad, describing the traditional Easter death of the daffodil: Later Cecil Day-Lewis wrote: In Black Narcissus (1939) Rumer Godden describes the disorientation of English nuns in the Indian Himalayas, and gives the plant name an unexpected twist, alluding both to narcissism and the effect of the perfume Narcisse Noir (Caron) on others. The novel was later adapted into the 1947 British film of the same name. The narcissus also appears in German literature. Paul Gerhardt, a pastor and hymn writer wrote: In the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association, for instance those of Fran√ßois Lemoyne, John William Waterhouse, and that of Poussin depicting flowers sprouting around the dying Narcissus, or Salvador Dal√≠'s Metamorphosis of Narcissus. American usage The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth. Narcissi first started to appear in western art in the late middle ages, in panel paintings, particularly those depicting crucifixion. For instance there is a crucifixion scene by the Westf√§lischer Meister in K√∂ln (c. 1415 ‚Äì 1435) in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in the resurrection, because they are perennial and bloom at Easter. Another example from this period is the altarpiece panel Noli me tangere from the Magdalenenkirche, Hildesheim Germany, by the Meister des G√∂ttinger Barf√º√üeraltars (c. 1410). In the centre of the panel, between the hand of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, daffodils can be seen growing. = Eastern cultures = In Chinese culture interest in narcissi centres on Narcissus tazetta, which can be grown indoors. Narcissus tazetta subsp. chinensis is widely grown in China as an ornamental plant and often known outside China as Chinese sacred lilies (N. tazetta 'Chinese Sacred Lily', Ê∞¥‰ªôËä±) or joss flowers. Tazetta daffodils were probably introduced to China, where they became naturalised, by Arab traders travelling the Silk Road at some time prior to the beginning of the Song Dynasty (i.e. before 960), presumably for their claimed medicinal properties. Flowering in spring, they became associated with Chinese New Year, signifying good fortune, prosperity and good luck. If the narcissus blooms on Chinese New Year, it is said to bring extra wealth and good fortune throughout the year. Its sweet fragrance is also highly revered in Chinese culture. The flower has many names in Chinese culture, including water narcissus (since they can be grown in water) and seui sin faa (water immortal flowers). In ancient Chinese culture the narcissus is referred to as water goddess of the Xiang River (), or the \\"goddess standing above the waves\\" (lingbo xianzi), also translated as \\"fairy over rippling waters\\". There are many legends in Chinese culture associated with Narcissus, including one of a poor but good man who was brought great wealth by this flower. As Chinese Garden Art expert Marianne Beuchert writes, in contrast to the West, narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art, but have become a symbol of good luck, in which the multi-headed inflorescence of N. tazetta symbolised a hundred headed water spirit. However, Zhao Mengjian (Ë∂ôÂ≠üÂ†Ö, c. 1199 ‚Äì 1267), in the Southern Song Dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi, and Zhao's love of the flower is celebrated by the loyalist Song poet Qiu Yuan (c. 1247 ‚Äì 1327). Narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to Japanese bonsai. The bulbs may be carved to create curling leaves (crab claw culture). The bulbs can produce six to eleven flower stems from a single bulb, each with an average of eight fragrant blooms. With the additional use of props such as ribbons, artificial eyes, bindings and florists' wire, even more elaborate scenarios can be created, representing traditional subjects such as roosters, cranes, flower baskets and even teapots. The Japanese visual novel Narcissu contains many references to the narcissus, the main characters setting out for the famed narcissus fields on Awaji Island, N. tazetta having also naturalised there. = Islamic culture = Islamic scholar Annemarie Schimmel states that the narcissi (called in Persian, whence the Arabic, Turkic and Urdu common names) are one of the most popular garden plants in Islamic culture. The Persian ruler Khosrau I () is said to have not been able to tolerate them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day. The Persian phrase (, literally \\"a reddish-blue narcissus\\") is a well-known metonymy for the \\"eye(s) of a mistress\\"Hayyim, Sulayman (1934‚Äì1936), ‚Äúÿ¥ŸáŸÑÿß‚Äù, in New Persian‚ÄìEnglish dictionary, Teheran: Librairie-imprimerie B√©roukhim in the classical poetries of the Persian, Turkic, and Urdu languages;Naravane; Nathani. to this day also the vernacular names of some narcissus cultivars (for example, Shahla-ye Shiraz and Shahla-ye Kazerun).Hanafi & Schnitzler, p. 75. As described by the poet Ghalib (1797‚Äì1869), \\"God has given the eye of the narcissus the power of seeing\\". The imagery could also be negative, such as blindness (white eye), sleepless or longing for love. The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas (756‚Äì814). In one of his most famous poems about narcissi he writes \\"eyes of silver with pupils of molten gold united with an emerald stalk\\". Schimmel describes an Arab legend that despite the apparent sinfulness of much of his poetry, his narcissus poems alone would earn him a place in Paradise. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi (1207‚Äì1273). Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus, \\"Whoever has two loaves of bread, sell one and buy narcissi, for while bread nourishes the body, the narcissus feeds the soul\\".  Popular culture  The word 'Daffodil' has been used widely in popular culture from Dutch cars to Swedish rock bands.  Festivals  In some areas where wild narcissi are particularly prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. The slopes around Montreux, Switzerland and its associated riviera come alive with blooms each May (May Snow), and are associated with the Narcissi Festival. However, the narcissi are now considered threatened. Festivals are held in many other countries and regions including Fribourg (Switzerland), Austria and in the United States, including Hawaii (Chinese New Year) and Washington state's Daffodil Festival.  Cancer  Various cancer charities around the world, including the American Cancer Society, New Zealand Cancer Society, Cancer Council Australia, the Irish Cancer Society, and Marie Curie (UK)'s Great Daffodil Appeal use the daffodil emblem as a fundraising symbol. \\"Daffodil Days\\", first instituted in Toronto in 1957 by the Canadian Cancer Society, are organized to raise funds by offering the flowers in return for a donation.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The facility and site were redeveloped into a mixed-use district after the power plant closed. HistoryOperating power plant= The Seaholm Power Plant was commissioned in 1948 to meet Austin's growing demand for electric power. The engineering firm Burns & McDonnell designed the complex, which was constructed in two phases in 1951 and 1955. The facility originally included a Turbine Generator Building, a Water Intake Structure and an Oil Heating Building. A guard booth and a storage building were added to the site later. Originally called \\"Power Plant No. 2,\\" on 2 June 1960 the plant was renamed posthumously for Walter E. Seaholm, a prominent figure in the administration of Austin's municipal utilities. Seaholm served as Austin's sole source of electric power from 1950 to 1959, until demand outpaced the 120 megawatts the plant could generate with all five boilers running. As other stations were built the city's reliance on Seaholm waned, and in 1989 the plant stopped providing power to the city, though it was used as a training facility until 1996, when it closed entirely. =Redevelopment= The site lay dormant until 2004, when the Austin city council requested proposals for redevelopment partners. Several firms and consultancies formed an organization called \\"Seaholm Power, LLC\\" which was designated in April 2005 to lead redevelopment of the defunct power plant and the surrounding site. A master development agreement was reached with the city in April 2008 specifying the renovations and new construction that would be undertaken. Work began on the plant's redevelopment in mid-2013. The interior of the turbine generator building was converted to a mixture of office, retail and restaurant space, with tenants occupying the facility beginning in 2015. A residential tower called Seaholm Residences was constructed at the west end of the site, also opening in 2015. , the city has not selected a final plan for the redevelopment of the water intake facility. Power generation Seaholm was a semi-outdoor power plant, with its boilers outdoors but its generators inside the Turbine Generator Building. It ultimately housed five Westinghouse turbine generators; the plant was originally built with two 20-megawatt generators and later expanded with two more 20-megawatt units and then one larger 40-megawatt unit. Seaholm was built with underground ash pits to accommodate coal-firing, but in fact the plant never ran on coal; the Oil Heating Building and underground fuel tanks also allowed the plant to burn crude oil, yet over its operating lifetime it was fired primarily with natural gas. Architecture Exterior lettering above the east entry to the Turbine Generator Building's south face =Turbine Generator Building= The largest building (which formerly housed the turbine generators) stands three stories high and faces southward, toward the lake. The exterior surface of the building is of structural cast-in-place reinforced concrete, punctuated by two south-facing doors and numerous large industrial windows.

The west facade carries additional metal lettering reading \\"City of Austin Power Plant.\\" The north facade of the building is dominated by the five external boilers and their tall smokestacks. The building's interior is divided into four levels centered on the vast two-story Turbine Room. =Water Intake Structure= The Water Intake Structure sits on the shore of Lady Bird Lake directly south of the Turbine Generator Building. The structure shares many design and architectural elements with the generator building, with exposed structural concrete walls and large industrial windows opening into a vast interior space. The south face of the building rises two stories above the lake, with ten sluice gates through which cooling water for the plant's steam condensers was taken in. This water was pumped to the generator building through massive underground pipes; after being used as coolant the water was discharged into nearby Shoal Creek.

It was written in 1797 but was unperformed following its rejection by Drury Lane Theatre. Coleridge revised and recast the play sixteen years later, giving it the new title of Remorse. Remorse met with considerable critical and commercial success when it was first performed in 1813: it ran for twenty nights at Drury Lane and was issued in print three times within the year.Moore, p.444 Despite the play's success, later critics dismissed the work as an Elizabethan pastiche. Swinburne said Remorse had \\"little worth praise or worth memory\\".Banerjee, p.130 Historicist scholars, however, have identified a revolutionary viewpoint embedded within Osorio which Coleridge, disavowing his youthful radicalism, sought to dilute when he later reformulated the work to create Remorse.Erving, p.392 Set in sixteenth-century Granada, the play is notable for its use of Gothic elements such as a castle, dungeon, cave and the supernatural. Coleridge's use of these may represent an attempt to elevate what he saw as the vulgar and sensational trappings of popular Gothic plays by situating them within a more refined form of poetic drama.Parker, p. 111 SynopsisAct I= A Moor Chief On a shore on the coast of Granada, Maria, the orphan ward of Velez, reaffirms her fidelity to Velez's son, Albert, who is missing. Velez urges the case for his other son, Osorio, the younger brother of Albert, but Maria dislikes Osorio. Velez believes Albert is dead because of Osorio's (false) report that he witnessed Albert's ship founder in a storm after it was captured as a prize by a Moorish pirate.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.1-8 Velez and Maria are interrupted by Francesco, an inquisitor, who has arrested and imprisoned a Moresco, Ferdinand, on suspicion of relapsing to Islam. Alhadra, the Moorish wife of Ferdinand, pleads for Osorio to intervene on his behalf. Osorio declares he will question Ferdinand. He then departs, followed by Francesco and Velez.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.8-16 Albert enters disguised as a Moor and wearing forbidden Moorish garments. He has been ‚Äòloitering‚Äô in the area for three weeks with a view to arousing the pain of remorse in Osorio and Maria for jointly plotting to have him murdered. When he encounters Maria, she fails to recognise him. Under the veil of a dream account, Albert relates the attempt on his life by a hired assassin. Maria's reaction to his account suggests to Albert that she was innocent of the assassination plot.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.21-31 =Act II= After arranging Ferdinand's release from prison, Osorio asks Ferdinand to trick Maria using a mock incantation to convince her that Albert is dead. Ferdinand was the assassin hired by Osorio to kill Albert. Osorio, convinced of Albert's death, is persuaded by Ferdinand to ask the \\"stranger\\" to trick Maria instead. Ferdinand relates how the stranger (the disguised Albert) has identified himself as \\"He that can bring the dead to life again\\".Coleridge, Osorio, pp.33-48 Osorio goes to Albert's cottage and fails to recognise his disguised brother. He demands that Albert perform a fraudulent s√©ance before Maria in which her portrait, which Albert used to wear around his neck, materialises. Osorio obtained the portrait from Ferdinand as proof of Albert's assassination. Osorio \\"returns\\" the portrait to Albert so that it can be used in the \\"dark trick\\". This will convince Maria that Albert is dead and encourage her to accept Osorio as husband.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.52-65 =Act III= Albert performs his act of sorcery before Maria, Velez and Osorio. Instead of using the portrait of Maria, however, Albert reveals a picture he has painted of his own assassination. Albert does this to show Osorio that his scheme to have his brother killed is known. Maria swoons and Velez is delighted by what he regards as a harmless manoeuvre by Osorio to convince Maria of Albert's death. Upon seeing the painting of Albert's assassination, Osorio immediately assumes that he has been betrayed by Ferdinand. He allows Francesco to imprison Albert for his sacrilegious act of sorcery.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.67-92 =Act IV= Osorio confronts Ferdinand in a dark cavern. The two men fight with swords before Ferdinand is disarmed and hurled down a chasm by Osorio to die.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.93-108 A castle near the coast of Granada In the court before Velez's castle, Maria and her Foster-Mother discuss the stranger (Albert). The Foster-Mother recounts a tale of a baby boy found by a woodman. The boy was a wild child of nature but became a learned youth. He was imprisoned for heresy but escaped to the New World where it is believed \\"he lived and died among savage men\\". The tale awakens sympathy within Maria for the imprisoned Albert. Velez condemns Maria for stubbornly refusing Osorio, and Francesco suggests that Maria should enter a convent. Maria's response is to mock Francesco's faith and oppressive behaviour.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.108-125 At night, Alhadra and her cohort of Moors meet in the mountains. In defiance of the Christian laws, they wear Moorish garments and proclaim their adherence to Mahomet. Alhadra reveals to the group that she followed Ferdinand to the cave and, after seeing Osorio leave the scene, entered the cave to hear Ferdinand's death groan in the chasm. She calls on the group to avenge his death.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.125-133 =Act V= Alhadra and the Moors capture Francesco but are prevented from killing him by Albert's companion, Maurice, who has joined the group. Alhadra and the Moors then proceed to the castle of Velez.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.135-143 In the dungeon, Osorio visits Albert and reveals a tortured sense of remorse for Albert's disappearance. Maria enters with the intention of helping Albert escape and Albert finally reveals himself to Osorio. Although Osorio begs for forgiveness, he nevertheless craves punishment for his crimes. When Alhadra enters, Osorio openly admits to murdering Ferdinand, whereupon he is dragged away and killed by the Moors.Coleridge, Osorio, pp.143-162 Dates Osorio was Coleridge's second drama, having written The Fall of Robespierre with Robert Southey in 1794. The creation of Osorio was prompted by a letter Coleridge received in February 1797 from W. L. Bowles through which Sheridan asked him \\"to write a tragedy on some popular subject\\".Mays, p.47 He began writing the work in March in Stowey, and on 6 June Coleridge read the first two and a half acts to William and Dorothy Wordsworth when he visited them at Racedown. Two days later, Coleridge wrote to Joseph Cottle that \\"Wordsworth admires my tragedy - which gives me great hopes\\".Banerjee, p.122 Coleridge had difficulties completing the work, however, and it was not until October that two copies of the play were prepared and sent to Bowles and William Linley (Sheridan's brother-in-law) for consideration.Mays, p.48 Coleridge was informed by Linley in December that Sheridan had rejected the play because of \\"the obscurity of the last three acts\\".Banerjee, p.121-2 Despite the rejection, the play was appreciated by Poole, Southey and Wordsworth. Coleridge also recited the play to William Hazlitt and showed it to the Wedgwoods in June 1798. Coleridge thought of publishing the work with Wordsworth's drama, The Borderers, but instead printed two extracts, \\"The Dungeon\\" and \\"The Foster-Mother‚Äôs Tale\\", in Lyrical Ballads in 1798. Sheridan communicated to Coleridge in May 1798 and July 1800 about the possibility of staging Osorio, but Coleridge resented Sheridan's cavalier handling of his manuscript and referred to him as \\"a damned impudent Dog\\".Mays, p.48 By October 1812, Sheridan's interests in Drury Lane had been bought out and the theatre was run by a subcommittee and largely managed by Samuel Whitbread and Samuel Arnold. Coleridge applied directly to Whitbread to request that his play, now entitled Remorse, be performed. The committee voted on 16 November to accept it. Osorio and Remorse Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1813 It is not known what text of the play Drury Lane received for consideration in 1812, but it is likely that the most extensive structural changes that made Remorse distinct from Osorio were undertaken only after the play went into production. The fact that Coleridge acknowledged the help he received from Arnold and the actors in making the play fit for the stage supports this view.Mays, p.1028 The revisions Coleridge made to Osorio to produce Remorse include the renaming of the characters and the rearrangement and supplementation of scenes and lines. Unlike Osorio, for example, who is dragged off by the Moors at the end of the play, Ordonio in Remorse is killed onstage. Among other passages, Coleridge also omitted \\"The Foster-Mother‚Äôs Tale\\" from Remorse, although it was printed in the appendices of the second and subsequent editions. Further significant structural changes include amendments to the first scene, which Don Alvar (Albert) opens in Remorse rather than first appearing in the latter part as Albert does in Osorio. Coleridge also modified the incantation scene in Act III to produce a greater climactic moment. In Osorio, none of the characters have any faith in magic before or after the s√©ance, which renders the scene undramatic. There is also confusion regarding which picture has been witnessed; in Remorse the image of Alvar's assassination is exposed amidst clashing music and stage effects to produce a shocking moment to which Valdez (Velez) reacts in horror.Banerjee, p.190 =Original cast= Alexander Rae was the original Ordonio (Osorio), \\"a character that did something to augment his reputation\\".Knight, DNB The following cast is from the original production of Remorse which ran from January - May 1813.Mays, p.1042 The equivalent names of the characters from Osorio are in brackets. *Don Alvar (Albert), the eldest son...Robert William Elliston *Don Ordonio (Osorio), the youngest son...Alexander Rae *Isidore (Ferdinand), a Moresco Chieftain, ostensibly a Christian...Vincent De Camp *Donna Teresa (Maria), an orphan heiress...Sarah Smith *Alhadra, wife to Isidore...Julia Glover *Marquis Valdez (Velez), father of the two brothers, and Donna Teresa's guardian...Alexander Pope *Monviedro (Francesco), a Dominican and Inquisitor...Snelling Powell *Zulimez (Maurice), the faithful attendant on Alvar...Mr Crooke *Naomi...James William Wallack *Familiars of the Inquisition *Moors and Servants, etc.Coleridge, Remorse, sig.A4r Music A glass harmonica Two published settings were made of Albert's Invocation Song from Act III. The first was made by William Carnaby in 1802 who must have received the text from Sheridan. Coleridge claimed he discovered Carnaby's music only in 1813. Coleridge expressed indignation that his authorship was not acknowledged on the printed sheet music and that Sheridan had obviously suffered his manuscript of Osorio to \\"wander about the Town from his house\\".Coleridge, Remorse, p.iv The second published setting of the Invocation Song is by Michael Kelly, the music supervisor at Drury Lane during the production of Remorse. Kelly wrote that Coleridge considered \\"my music was everything he could have wished\\". Coleridge also said that Kelly's setting surpassed the efforts of composers in Italy who had also put the same words to music.Kelly, p.374 Coleridge's stage direction that the song should be accompanied by an \\"Instrument of Glass or Steel\\" refers to the glass harmonica. This direction provides a small example of Schiller‚Äôs influence over Coleridge's conception of the play. Schiller referred to the instrument in a similar sorcery scene narrated by the Sicilian sorcerer in The Ghost- Seer.Banerjee, p.151 Sources For Osorio, Coleridge was chiefly indebted to the works of Schiller, in particular The Robbers, and the novel, The Ghost- Seer. The plot of Osorio is clearly drawn from the story narrated by the Sicilian sorcerer in The Ghost-Seer in which Jeronymo, who is betrothed to Antonia, goes missing and is believed to be the victim of Algerian pirates. The sorcerer is requested by Lorenzo, the younger brother and murderer of Jeronymo, to contrive the appearance of Jeronymo's spirit so that Lorenzo can marry Antonia.Banerjee, p.150 Osorio's desire for Maria and his betrayal of Albert has parallels with the actions of Franz Moor in The Robbers. Franz strives to dispossess his brother Karl of his inheritance and his lover, Amelia. Karl forgives his brother, but Franz is punished by Karl's band of outlaws.Banerjee, p.153 Robert Watson‚Äôs History of Philip II provided Coleridge with the setting for his play.Fox, p.258 From Watson‚Äôs book, Coleridge garnered information about the Inquisition and Philip‚Äôs persecution of the Morescoes. Coleridge used this to furnish his drama with details to which the characters often refer, such as the prohibition of native Moorish dress, religion and customs. These oppressive measures incited revolt in Spain in Watson‚Äôs account, and they are contributory reasons for the revolt of Alhadra and her followers in Coleridge‚Äôs drama.Banerjee, p.156 Critical interpretationsBiographical= The ambivalent relationship between Albert and Osorio has been likened to that between Coleridge and his brother, George. Coleridge‚Äôs discharge from the army in 1794 was facilitated by George who also took on his brother‚Äôs college debts.Fox, p.263 It has thus been argued that Coleridge \\"must have seen himself at times as Osorio receiving Albert‚Äôs forgiveness\\".Fox, p.266 On the other hand, Coleridge may on occasion have seen himself as the wronged Albert because of George's desires that his brother lead a more conventional lifestyle, which Coleridge resented. Coleridge's plans to create a Pantisocracy in the Americas had been met with hostility by his family, and he regarded them \\"as commonplace rich men, bigots from ignorance, and ignorant from bigotry\\".Fox, p.266 =Political= William Pitt addressing Parliament Some critics have attended to the political context in which Osorio was produced and how it reflects Coleridge's radicalism around 1797. The oppressive conduct of Francesco's Inquisition probably alludes to the Pitt government which Coleridge denounced for its reactionary measures such as the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in 1794 and the passing of the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act in 1795.Fox, p.261 By the time Coleridge had completed Remorse in 1812, however, he had adopted a considerably more conservative outlook. Some attempts to explain the differences between Osorio and Remorse have therefore focussed on Coleridge's political transformation. Rather than the despotism of Pitt, the tyranny condemned in Remorse may be that of Napoleon, whom Coleridge despised.Moore, p.463 Such rewriting has also been regarded as a sign of Coleridge using a Spanish setting, influenced by the Peninsular War, to address national identity. Radical allusions are diminished in Remorse: the persecuted character of Alhadra, for example, is simplified in Remorse with the notable omission of her apocalyptic vengeance speech that ends Osorio. This reduction of Alhadra's complexity betrays Coleridge's diminished sympathy for the oppressed masses.Erving, pp.404-5 The excision of Albert's dungeon soliloquy in Act V (\\"The Dungeon\\" in Lyrical Ballads) from Remorse is another illustration of Coleridge's later conservatism. Dungeons like the Bastille were a potent Gothic symbol of ancien regime tyranny. Albert asserts that it is Nature, not the punitive \\"friendless solitude\\" of prison, that most effectively heals the \\"wandering and distemper‚Äôd child\\". Without such ideas, Remorse is much less politically and morally heterodox than Osorio.Erving, pp.404-5 =Theatrical= The supernatural sorcery episode and the scenes in a castle, cave and dungeon demonstrates Coleridge's engagement with the Gothic conventions that were popular with contemporary audiences. Yet Coleridge, like Wordsworth, Hazlitt and Lamb, strongly disliked popular Gothic dramas because of their common emphasis on sensational spectacles rather than an audience's imagination. Coleridge identified the merit of Monk Lewis‚Äôs successful Drury Lane production of The Castle Spectre, for instance, as deriving entirely from \\"situations\\" that were \\"all borrowed, and all absolutely pantomimical\\".Parker, p. 111 Osorio and Remorse can therefore be seen as Coleridge's attempt to accommodate popular Gothic features within a form of Shakespearean poetic drama that he regarded as more dignified.Moore, p.444 One supernatural element in the play is the central dramatic suggestion that Albert is a walking spirit. It is never made explicit that Ferdinand did not in fact assassinate Albert. When Albert relates the attempt on his life to Maria in Act I, he only says that his assassins \\"thank‚Äôd me for redeeming them from murder\\". His decision later in the scene to \\"haunt this scene no more\\", Velez's remark to Maria in Act IV that the \\"Wizard haunts you\\", and Osorio's exclamation in the final act that Albert is a \\"Spirit of the dead!\\" are among many intimations that Albert is a ghost.Parker, p. 123 NotesReferences *Banerjee, Jibon Krishna, The Dramatic Writings of Wordsworth and Coleridge (Calcutta: Prajna, 1983) *Coleridge, Samuel Taylor, Osorio: A Tragedy (London: John Pearson, 1873) *Coleridge, Samuel Taylor, Remorse (London: W.

It was Coleridge's last play and, like Osorio, was rejected by Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. It received its first performance in a production by Thomas Dibdin at the Surrey Theatre in 1816.Mays, p.1330 Plot The first part of the drama presents Raab Kiuprili, a heroic chieftain who confronts Emerick, the usurper of the crown of Illyria. Casimir, Kiuprili's son, turns against his father as a result of Emerick's deceit. Kiuprili is imprisoned with the deposed queen, Zapolya, but they escape with her son and rightful heir, Prince Andreas. In the second part, Zapolya is forced to live in the forest and is separated from Andreas, who is raised as a peasant by Old Bathory, a mountaineer. The play culminates in the defeat of Emerick and the reunification of Zapolya and Andreas. Kiuprili and Casimir are also reconciled.Erving p.406 Analysis The play is manifestly influenced by Shakespeare's \\"romances\\", in particular the tragicomedies The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline. These plays are concerned with usurpation and both feature the raising of rightful heirs in wild or pastoral environments.Mays, p.1335 Coleridge probably used William Coxe's History of the House of Austria and Carolus Franciscus Palma's Notitia rerum Hungaricarum as historical sources for the setting of the play. Zapolyas character of Pestalutz, an assassin in the employ of Emerick, derives his name and profession from Schiller's Death of Wallenstein.Mays, p.1334 A reviewer of Dibdin's production in 1816 wrote that Zapolya was \\"of too serious a cast for the frequenters of this Theatre, and were we not fearful of giving offence we should say too good, at any rate we may be allowed to pronounce it too poetical\\".Mays, p.1331 NotesReferences *Erving, George, ‚ÄòColeridge as Playwright‚Äô in Frederick Burwick (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Oxford: OUP, 2009), pp.392-411 *Mays, J.

According to See the constructing of a 30-knot turbine steamship for transatlantic trade was entirely feasible. Turbine engine would come to stay, and would solve many marine problems. He and a colleague had declared, according to the article, that \\"there is no question but that the turbine engine will ultimately displace the reciprocating one on shipboard, as it Is now doing on land, but up to, the present time it has failed to do ee or shewn any. Superiority outside of reduced vibration, as there yet remains unsolved the exact combination of turbine, hull, and screw propeller to give results superior to those obtained from the reciprocating engine in vessels...\\" One of the chief engineers at the Cramps yard declared, that \\"it was not until 1894, that the idea of propelling a vessel by means of a turbine was first put into practical form. Before that time the turbine had never been used for marine purposes, but its use had been devoted to pumping, coaling driving fans forced draught and ventilating purposes. The first vessel to be fitted with turbine engines was the Turbinia. Then came torpedo boat destroyers, the Viper and Cobra, achieved remarkable speed, but unfortunately were both lost before it was able to obtain comparisons in service with other destroyers, and this somewhat adversely effected the progress of the turbine engine generally.\\" Furthermore, the \\"British cruiser Amethyst was the next step of the application of the turbine war vessels, and the result of the trail of this vessel in compared with sister vessels ordered at the same time and of the same dimensions and lines, butt fitted with other engines demonstrated the economy of the turbine to fit to this class of vessels and more especially of higher power.\\"  Publications  Horace See was portrayed in the July 1892 edition of Cassier's Magazine. * Horace See, Some Sea Specialties.

Studies have shown that certain scenes in certain films stimulate different part of the brain in different ways. Gaining this knowledge is not only beneficial on a neuroscience level, but for filmmakers as well. History Although these studies began in the 2000s, this idea has been around since the early years of film. This is demonstrated with Sergei Eisenstein's experiments with montage theory and Lev Kuleshov's famous ‚ÄúKuleshov Effect‚Äù. These Russian filmmakers studied American filmmakers such as D.W. Griffith and discovered that film was a ‚Äúmalleable‚Äù art. The Kuleshov Effect proved that the juxtaposition of a series of images together can create ideas and emotions in an audience's mind. This revolutionized propaganda in the Soviet Union to spread the influence the collective strength of a new Marxist state after the revolution of 1917. This idea has grown ever since. Alfred Hitchcock referred to this idea of film saying, ‚Äú[Film] creation is based on an exact science of audience reactions‚Äù.\\"BrainCraft\\", PBS Digital Studios. \\"How Movies Control Our Brain.\\" Online Video Clip.

Movies are projected onto those mirrors and sound is transmitted by the subjects wearing high-fidelity MRI compatible headphones. As the viewers‚Äô watch these films they are being monitored in fMRI machines that map the brains activity. When the studies are conducted the participants are told they can look where ever they please, which is referred to as ‚Äúfree-viewing‚Äù, and they were told they could stop the study at any point. All the participants in the study had similar eye movement and stimulation in areas of the brain when shown certain movies, scenes or clips of video regardless of the ‚Äúfree-viewing‚Äù method that was in place. This was documented by a new method of ‚ÄúInter-Subject Correlation‚Äù in which they mapped the brain activity of the participants and aligned them over the same timeline.Hasson, Uri et al. \\"Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film.\\" Projections: Journal for Movies and Mind 2:1, Summer 2008: 1-26. Current Application Peter Katz, working with MindSign Neuromarketing is another group involved in the neurological studies of film. He and his team are bringing this ‚Äúcurrent market research‚Äù by focusing on specific genre's to gain an understanding of how directors could affect an audience's subconscious mind. For example, in the horror genre, MRI used to view activity in the amygdala to look for fear, anger, rage and fight or flight type emotions. By using information obtained from MRIs they can determine exactly what scenes and even specific images invoke an emotional response, or the opposite. The potential for this kind of information is that it can be more accurate than forms filled out at the end of test screenings since the data is recorded in the moment, and is recording how they the subjects are subconsciously reacting, as opposed to how they consciously perceive they are reacting.Silver, Curtis. \\"Neurocinema Aims to Change the Way Movies Are Made.\\" WIRED.

He served as governor of the Armenian region of Vaspurakan, and is one of the first known members of the Komnenos family, which came to rule the Byzantine Empire in 1081‚Äì1185.  Biography  Nikephoros Komnenos is one of the first documented members of the Komnenos family, but nothing is known of his early life or his connection to the main branch of the family, which eventually gave rise to the imperial dynasty. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos suggested that he was born , and that he was the younger brother of the Komnenian dynasty's patriarch, Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, but neither assumption can be verified. Nikephoros is first mentioned in the historical record in , shortly after the King of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes (), unable to resist the pressure of his Muslim neighbours, surrendered his kingdom to the Byzantine emperor Basil II in exchange for large estates and the governorship of the theme of Sebasteia. Basil II initially gave the new province (, Asprakania, in Greek) to Basil Argyros, but was forced to replace him soon after due to his ineptitude. The protospatharios Nikephoros Komnenos was chosen to succeed Basil Argyros as governor (strategos or katepano), and swiftly managed to enforce Byzantine rule over the country. The contemporary Armenian historian Aristakes Lastivertsi records that Nikephoros captured the principality of Arzes on the northern shore of Lake Van, and incorporated it into his province, although according to the narrative of the likewise contemporary Arab Christian historian Yahya of Antioch, the feat was carried out by Emperor Basil himself. Nikephoros Komnenos continued to serve as strategos of Vaspurakan under Basil II's brother and successor, Constantine VIII, but in 1026 he was dismissed on suspicion of disloyalty and recalled to Constantinople, where he was blinded. Two different versions are provided by the historical record on the background to his recall: the Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes reports that he insisted on a written pledge of support from his troops, intended to be used against the neighbouring Turkish rulers, but which was interpreted by Constantine as an attempt to create a force personally loyal to him. While Skylitzes declares the accusation baseless and puts the blame on the over-suspicious Constantine, Aristakes claims that Nikephoros was indeed engaged in treasonous talks with King George I of Georgia (), aiming to either declare himself emperor, or make Vaspurakan an independent kingdom. When the troops of Cappadocia found out about it, however, they captured Nikephoros and sent him as a prisoner to Constantinople, where Constantine VIII, after carefully examining the affair and convincing himself of Nikephoros' guilt, had him and eight of his companions blinded in the next year. His fate after that, the date of his death, as well as the existence of any descendants, are unknown.

Background In early Angevin England, sheriffs played an important part in local government, representing the Crown, keeping the peace, running the operations of the county and royal hundred courts and managing summons and similar legal orders.; They usually managed the royal manors in their shire, collecting the rents and spending money locally on the Crown's behalf. They were typically members of the local baronage, but were appointed by the king, and they expected to make a profit from their office. Inquest In 1170, King Henry II, who ruled over a network of lands across Europe, returned to England after several years of absence. He promptly established a commission to examine any malpractices in local government, which became known as the Inquest of the Sheriffs. The inquiry was widespread, extending not just to the King's sheriffs but to other royal officers, and even to the financial practices of the leaders of the clergy, the barons and burgesses in the towns. A series of local circuits were established,G.O. Sayles. the Medieval Foundations of England (London 1967) p. 329 and the commissioners (in a contemporary's words) required ‚Äúall the men of the realm, including earls, barons, knights, freeholders and even villeins in every shire to...give true testimony concerning the things of which the sheriffs and their men had deprived them‚Äù.'The Deeds of Henry II', in D. Baker ed., The Early Middle Ages (London 1968) p. 148 Outcome By the end of the year, 21 out of the 26 sheriffs in England had been dismissed from office. Of those retained, the majority were not barons, but members of the royal household; while sixteen of the new sheriffs chosen were already employees of the Exchequer.W. A. Morris, The Medieval English Sheriff (Manchester 1968) p. 113 The sweeping changes undermined the links between the local barons and the office of sheriffs, leaving the majority of holders as ministeriales.J. R. Tanner ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol V (Cambridge 1926) p. 581 Henry also increased the role of travelling royal judges in the court system, and increasingly the role of sheriff became one of a local official whose purpose was to represent the royal bureaucracy and assist the judges when they visited, rather than acting as an independent power in their own right. Surviving returns Unfortunately only two partial returns from the Inquest survive, one detailing payments to the Earl of Arundel in East Anglia, for such things as the aid for the marriage of Henry's daughter; the other payments to the sheriff from the borough of Worcester for the farm, for conveying prisoners, and for the royal marriage.J.

It was first published in 1964 in the Editorial Sudamericana.  Analysis  \\"The Continuity of Parks\\" is a short story written by Julio Cort√°zar, which is, according to Lauro Zavala, \\"simultaneously the fiction and metafiction most studied in the history of literature\\".Zavala, Lauro (2006). La minificci√≥n bajo el microscopio. UNAM. pp. 193-198. . Consultado el 15 de febrero de 2013. In the story, reality and fiction intertwine through a story within a story. The frame story presents a man reading a novel on his return to his home estate after completing some \\"urgent business\\" in town. The novel that he is reading, the embedded story, describes two lovers who meet in a cabin in the woods, with a plan to destroy \\"that other body\\". The structure of the story is broken when one of the characters of the novel, the embedded story, introduces himself into the reality of the frame story. The reader of the novel is an ironic adaptation of Cort√°zar's passive reader, who \\"does not want problems but solutions, or false problems that allow others to suffer comfortably sitting in his chair, without committing himself to the drama that should also be his\\". At the end of the story, the drama he does not want to be a part of is his own. The name of the story refers to the three contexts, or reality plans, which are identified as \\"parks\\". The first is the author and reader of \\"The Continuity of Parks\\", the second is the frame story of a man of business reading a novel, and the third is the embedded story about the two lovers. The story is divided in two paragraphs of 380 and 170 words. The first paragraph presents the frame story of the man reading and the embedded story of the lovers meeting in a cabin in the woods. The second paragraph provides detailed description, an excess of information, that constitutes a case of paralysis. There are several allusions that parody the murder mystery, both in its rules and in its logic. The story begins by introducing a landowner who escapes from his business responsibilities by taking refuge in his study to read a novel. He seems to take pleasure in sitting in a high-backed armchair covered in green velvet as he reads and looks out the windows. This space is not accidental: everything is organized and closed to the outside. The novel that he reads has the style of a simple plot and realistic characters, with a final scene that shows two lovers in a cabin planning a murder, creating a disturbing atmosphere in the story within the story. The actions of the fictitious reader are described with words that suggest passivity (rest, armchair, sprawl, etc.) while the actions of the lovers present suspenseful action (blood, kisses, dagger, etc.). The text presents a labyrinthine temporal succession. The real reader begins reading the story as innocently as the character reading his novel. The closer to the end of the story and the embedded novel respectively, both readers feel that something terrible will happen. In the last paragraph the reader-character becomes a victim and the real reader becomes guilty for imagining the death of the character. The lack of closure of the story for not having read the novel makes the end disappear, evidencing the guilt of the real reader, who has become victimized or an accomplice in the death of the character while watching the crime. But it is also a double crime, since the real reader is also a real victim because the end of the story has disappeared, at the same time that he is an imaginary victim by his own imagination. This conclusion multiplies the doubts instead of revealing the mystery. When the character reader dies, the two realities are confused.  Plot  The story begins with a landowner reading a novel that he had started a few days earlier. He had been sidetracked by business matters and a trip to town to discuss a matter of joint ownership, but on his return to his estate, he resumes reading the novel. He sits in a high-backed, green velvet armchair, savoring the \\"almost perverse pleasure\\" of reading the story while enjoying his cigarettes and the view of the park from his study window. In his novel, a man and woman, two lovers, meet in the woods to carry out a plan. The novel that the businessman is reading is about a couple of lovers who are meeting in a cabin in the woods. He has a wound on the face from a branch, and she is waiting for him. She wants to caress him but he rejects her because they have planned this meeting to finalize how they were going to kill someone. They review their alibis and eliminate possible errors. Nightfall is approaching. In the second paragraph, the woman goes north, while the man approaches a house on the estate. Armed with the dagger, the man goes inside the house, all according to plan and sees his victim: a man sitting in a green velvet armchair reading a novel. At that moment, the two stories join, as the (real) reader realizes that the man in the chair is the victim of the two lovers in the novel he is reading.  Characters  * The man reading ‚Äì Despite owning an estate and attending to matters of joint ownership in town, the man enjoys the privacy of reading a romantic murder mystery in his study. Through his perspective, the narrator describes the dual consciousness in the experience of reading. He is absorbed into the fictional world of his novel while still being aware of kinesthetic sensations of his own world, such as the texture of the chair, the cigarettes at hand, and the wind blowing outside. * The heroine ‚Äì A woman is meeting her lover at a mountain cabin in the woods. She is apprehensive, caught in a \\"sordid dilemma,\\" and is meeting for the last time in the cabin to finalize plans and alibis before heading north. * The hero ‚Äì He is the woman‚Äôs lover. The wound on his face from a branch and his rejection of the woman's caresses suggests his impatience and tension. He carries a dagger and has been given information about the layout of house, the absence of dogs and estate manager, and the location of his victim.

At this time, the Mission District was predominantly Latino (around 45% of the neighborhood was Latino according to a 1970 census) and the Muralistas were hugely inspired by the Chicano Movement and the cultures of their community. There were other muralists/muralist groups, such as Los Tres Grandes, working in the Mission District at the time, but they were the first females to step onto the scene. The male artists, like Los Tres Grandes, often painted murals about violence, war, and revolutionary figures, but the Muralistas were not interested in such aggressively political paintings. They focused on portraying their culture and the beauty of Chicana/Latina-American womanhood. Murals Latinoamerica (1974) = Their first publicly commissioned mural was called \\"Latinoamerica\\", located on Mission Street and 25th Street, and painted for the Mission Model Cities organization. They were tasked with creating a mural that would represent the Latino culture of the area. To accomplish this, they used a lot of symbolism that was relevant to Latinos in their mural, such as a pyramid of cornstalks illustrating the significant role that corn played in the lives of indigenous American peoples. The mural Latinoam√©rica helps to connect Latinos to their culture and teach future generations more about their cultural roots. Some culturally significant symbols found in the mural include an Aztec eagle and ancestors; this homage to Latin American mythology bridged a connection between the Latino community and their \\"indigenous past as a form of cultural empowerment.\\" San Francisco's Mission District was home to a large and diverse group of Latinos, whom the Mujeres Muralistas acknowledged in their mural. Alongside Latinos native to the United States, Latinoam√©rica extended its representation to Latinos from nations such as Bolivia, Venezuela, and Peru. The mural recognized and honored Latinos from both North America and South America in efforts to foster a \\"pan-Latino identity.\\" Much like the Mission District, the Murjeres Muralistas had a diverse group of Latinas, their unique cultural and national identities influencing their stylistic contributions to Latinoam√©rica. According to Latinas in the United States, set: A Historical Encyclopedia, edited by Vicki L. Ruiz and Virginia S√°nchez Korrol, common themes underlying the work of many Latina artists were those of \\"human welfare and social justice.\\" Artwork, for example, would depict people performing daily jobs and tasks, often focusing on the working class (e.g. farm workers and laborers). In fact, Latinoam√©rica \\"[drew] inspiration from the role that Latinas [played] in the labor force.\\" In particular, the portrayal of women and children in Latinoam√©rica was the Mujeres Muralistas' way of redefining Latino murals, celebrating the Latino community with vibrant images instead of recreating the dark \\"'blood and guts' aesthetic\\" painted by their male counterparts. = Para El Mercado (1974) = The Muralistas were recruited to create a mural on the side of Paco's Tacos, a restaurant on the corner of 24th and South Van Ness. A McDonald's had just been built across the street, so the mural on the Paco's Tacos building was an effort to keep the restaurant unique and relevant compared to its new competitor.This mural featured four large women surrounded by an abundance of colorful fruits, animals, and exotic natural landscapes. The group chose to focus the mural around the theme of food and the concept of the Latin American marketplace. The theme felt fitting to them given that the wall mural was located on the side of a restaurant. = Fantasy for Children (1975) = Fantasy for Children is the only mural created by the Muralistas that is still standing and can still be seen today. They were commissioned to make the mural for the 24th Street Minipark. Because it was a space for children, they wanted to use the mural to make the park's environment more friendly and appealing to families so it would be used more. They considered the kind of people that would engage with the space and the final product was extremely colorful and had a lot of symbolism tying back to the Latino culture, such as a female sun acting as a sort of Mother Nature type goddess and a woman blowing wind in the top lefthand corner that appeared to be of Mayan descent. Although the mural can still be seen today, it is in need of restoration.  Media Attention  Prominent Mujeres Muralista artist Patricia Rodriguez has commented on the group's work saying, \\"The statements that we made were very feminine and we got a lot of criticism because we weren‚Äôt doing soldiers with guns, weren‚Äôt doing revolutionary figures. We were painting women. Women in the marketplace, women breastfeeding, women doing art. People got really angry that we were doing that. ‚ÄòHow could you do this when there‚Äôs so much going on?‚Äô but we were saying that being a women is a revolution in society.\\" References  Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:Arts organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Mission District, San Francisco Category:1970s in San Francisco Category:1970s in art ","title":"Mujeres Muralistas"},{"id":"45629934","text":"The Journal of Early Modern History is a peer-reviewed academic journal focusing on the early modern period.

The series focuses on funny and absurd situations happening to the various characters of the Type-Moon franchises, mostly from Fate/stay night and Tsukihime. Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia characters ; : :The main hero of Fate/stay night. Appears in most Fate/stay night segments of Carnival Phantasm. He is shown to enjoy spending time with the girls in his life and will often bend over backwards to keep them all happy, including agreeing to go on four simultaneous dates so that none of them would feel sad or neglected. Shirou is very naive and believes that his girls all get along fine and seems generally unaware of some of their more underhanded attempts to keep him to themselves, such as Illya hexing him with sleep paralysis so that she could sleep next to him. ; : :One of the main heroines of Fate/stay night and considered to be the \\"main heroine\\" of the Fate segments. In Carnival Phantasm, Saber is shown to be very awkward and gullible in her attempts at living in and interacting with the modern world, to the point that she believes her maid outfit for her waitressing job at Ahnenerbe is merely common working attire. Due to her life as King Arthur she has a hard time openly expressing her love for Shir≈ç and usually ends up blushing heavily and stuttering when confronted with a situation where she must openly express her affection, often forcing Shir≈ç to make the first move. She turns into Saber Alter when her ahoge is plucked, and can only be restored to her original self by Shirou. Certain aspects of her character, such as an appreciation of good food, supernatural charisma, and love of lions, are greatly exaggerated. ; : :One of the main heroines of Fate/stay night. In Carnival Phantasm, she also appears in a Magical Girl alter ego form known as Kaleido Ruby. Her tsundere attitude, greed and lack of skill with modern technology are exaggerated. ; : :One of the main heroines of Fate/stay night. In comparison to Fate/stay night, has a greatly reduced role, receiving only one dedicated episode, and minor appearances in two other episodes, one of which almost entirely consists of her stalking Shirou while he is on dates with Saber and Rin after she figured out his and Shiki's multiple date plan. She seems to be obsessed with her role as her story's \\"tragic heroine\\" and enjoys playing the part to the point of absurdity, such as goading others into mistreating her for the sake of her role, to the point where she can't refrain from referring to her own \\"beauty\\" while Shinji attempts to rape her as if to rile him up further so as to make the scene that much more horrific. ; : :Shir≈ç's adoptive older sister. Illya is portrayed within the series as a spoiled brat, throwing tantrums when she doesn't get her way. She is in love with Shir≈ç (who only loves her as a sibling) and is very possessive of him. She sees the other girls as threats and constantly battles with Rin for Shir≈ç's attention. She is not above using her magecraft to get her way, including the use of a sleep spell on Shir≈ç, followed by a paralyzing curse so that she would either have the opportunity to sleep next to him or \\"awaken\\" him with a kiss. She is one of the announcers of the Holy Grail War in the first episode, though her servant Berserker still competes by himself. She appears in the Phantas-Moon movie as an Angra Mainyu- like monster, complaining about her lack of a route before being calmed by a combined attack from Arcueid and Rin and realizing that she is still beloved by the Type-Moon community regardless. ; : :A hotheaded, prideful Servant of Kirei Kotomine and Bazett Fraga McRemitz. One of the recurring gags with Lancer in Carnival Phantasm is that due to bad luck, he will always be killed off in every episode. The other characters will exclaim, \\"Lancer died!\\" and \\"You bastards!\\". This appears to be a reference to Kenny from South Park. He is in love with his would-be master, Bazett, who loves him in kind and any conversation they have eventually devolves into flirting and loving words, much to Caren's annoyance. ; : :The Servant and wife of S≈çichir≈ç Kuzuki and a talented mage. While Caster in the canon series is haughty and cruel, Caster in Carnival Phantasm flips between acting dignified and lovestruck over her master/husband. Although she is devoted to S≈çichir≈ç, she also has an obsession with Saber, creating dozens of figurines of her and hoping to kidnap her so she can dress up Saber in homemade outfits. Unlike the visual novel and anime, she almost never wears her hooded cloak. ; : :The Servant of Illyasviel von Einzbern. Berserker is powerful and foolish, yet well-meaning. Under Illya's control, she frequently uses him for menial tasks like shopping for batteries. He has a fondness for Lancer (which Lancer does not return), often chasing after him and lugging him around, and even using him as a weapon. He is capable of transforming into a tank-like vehicle, dubbed \\"Berser-Car\\". ; : :A Servant summoned by Caster. Assassin's movement is confined only to within the gate of the Ry≈´d≈çji Temple, so as such he is usually represented by a cardboard cutout Caster carries around to stand in for him. However, he manages to finally leave the temple during the Holy Grail Grand Prix, via the loophole of carrying the gate around with him aboard a truck. Due to having been trapped in one location for so long, Assassin has gone crazy and holds conversations with the inanimate gate, treating it like a loyal friend. ; : :An arrogant Servant who is constantly showing off his wealth and interrupting others much to everyone's chagrin. Gilgamesh also makes an appearance as a younger version of himself, Caren Hortensia's Servant. Unlike his older self, the younger Gilgamesh is more kind and respectful. His lust for Saber is shown to extend to her Saber Alter side, unlike in Fate/stay night where he loses all interest in her, but his feelings becomes more masochistic and he is reduced to a meek and subservient slave in her presence. Tsukihime and Melty Blood characters ; : :The main character of Tsukihime. He is portrayed as a playboy of sorts who enjoys the company of the females who are in love with him and the challenge of balancing all five of them at once, unlike his counterpart Shir≈ç (who sees him as unfaithful), but often finds himself used as a prize as his girls compete for his affections unlike Shir≈ç, whose harem gets along with only some passive-aggressive behavior. ; : :One of the main heroines of Tsukihime and main heroine of the show's Tsukihime segments. Unlike most of the cast, she is unfazed with various absurd things happening in the show. She is also the star of her own segment where she plays her magical girl alter-ego \\"Phantasmoon\\" where she fights mushroom-like monsters. ; : :One of the main heroines of Tsukihime. In the series, her love of curry is exaggerated and is constantly at odds with Arcueid and Akiha due to all of them being in love with Shiki. A running gag in the series has her being mistaken for an Indian due to the smell of curry on her body. ; : :One of the main heroines of Tsukihime. In this series, her tsundere personality is exaggerated, with her \\"angry\\" stage represented by her hair turning red, a reference to her demonic heritage. The \\"Phantasmoon\\" segments portray her as the villain and nemesis of Arcueid, although her \\"evil\\" plots are merely good deeds like feeding stray dogs or drawing a manga. ; : :One of the main heroines of Tsukihime. Along with exaggeration of her emotionless persona, she also is the subject of frequent references to inside jokes within the fans, such as \\"Brainwashing Detective Hisui,\\" and hypnotism. ; : :One of the main heroines of Tsukihime. In Carnival Phantasm, she is portrayed as a mad scientist/witch, a reference to her role in Tsukihime. ; : :A classmate of Shiki, also known as Sacchin. A running gag with her is that the cast frequently cannot remember her name, which is a reference to her route being cut from the original visual novel. She leads a three-girl comedy troupe called the \\"After-school Alleyway Alliance\\", with Sion Atlasia (Rio Natsuki) and Riesbyfe Stridberg (Akeno Watanabe). Their segments follow a formula where Sacchin starts the act by speaking about some topic, Riesbyfe gets distracted and derails the act, the two get into an argument, and Sion confuses them all by claiming the entire event was all within her calculations. Ahnenerbe Cafe ; : :An anthropomorphic cat spirit and employee of Ahnenerbe resembling Arcueid. She along with the other cats serve as the hosts of the show and often comment on the episode's story, as well as introduce upcoming segments in interludes. In some episodes she plays other roles aside from host. ; : :An anthropomorphic cat spirit resembling Nrvnqsr Chaos. He is often seen smoking a cigarette. He is obsessed with the idea of \\"manliness\\" and often uses strange phrases to describe things, such as claiming that laser beams are \\"unisex\\". ; : :A pink haired anthropomorphic cat spirit. She is sensible and converses regularly with the others with a more reserved attitude and is often seen drinking with Neco Arc Chaos. She is also prone to occasional bouts of drama and fantasizes about settling down and having children of her own some day. ;Type-Moon Ace Vol. 7. \\"Neco Arc Bubbles\\". : :A blond haired anthropomorphic cat spirit. She babbles and nods her head in agreement to any situations while keeping a spaced-out grin on her face. ; : :An otaku anthropomorphic cat spirit. He is a big fan of magical girls, Type-Moon heroines, and cosplay. While not actually an employee of Ahnenerbe, he often hangs out with its staff and drags them to events outside the restaurant. He is also a huge fan of Saber and will prostrate himself before her when the two are in the same room. Other characters ; : :A giant slime-like creature which is the embodiment of all the evil in the Holy Grail. Grail-kun is the host of his own segment, reminiscent of Doraemon where various characters ask him for help over certain matters. Due to his nature, Grail-kun's solution to every problem is a kitchen knife, along with a flashy name for it and a suggestion to commit violence. ; : :The female protagonist from the videogame Fate/Extra. While similar in appearance to Saber from Fate/stay Night, Red Saber is arrogant, proud and shamelessly flaunts her sexuality, noting that her transparent skirt does not bare her flesh, but rather 'deliberately allows others to see it'. She makes an appearance at the end of episode 8, during the Tiger Dojo segment where she mentions that she had heard that there was a 'carnival' taking place, but was disappointed to find that she had missed it.

She also made her own films and animations, including the award-winning Up is Down from 1969.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401252/ Millie Goldsholl grew up in Freeport, New York on the south shores of Long Island. As a child she developed a love for pastoral life and art, creating elaborate chalk drawings of her family and grandparents' farm animals outside her family's home. Millie moved from the sidewalk to the easel when she entered high school. Here, encouraging art teachers inspired Millie to make a career out of her passion for art. Millie moved to Chicago, Illinois when she was sixteen with her sister and widowed mother. They moved in with Millie's brother, who had recently acquired a factory job and needed help around the house. After failing to enroll in art classes that required too many prerequisites, Millie joined her brother in the factory.http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/17 Millie entered the design world through her husband, Morton (Mort) Goldsholl, who invited Millie to enter the world of advertising alongside him. The two met at work, a paper box manufacturer where Millie did accounting and Mort designed packaging. Mort kept his day job as a freelance designer and encouraged Millie to enter the newly formed IIT Institute of Design, the first school in Chicago to offer a design degree. Millie ultimately studied architecture, but the school's Bauhaus inspired environment encouraged her to experiment with different materials, mediums and machines. It is here where she was first introduced to filmmaking, and where she developed a lifelong connection to L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy's vision of industry, art and design. In 1955, Mort and Millie Goldsholl established Goldsholl Design & Film Associates. Mort took responsibility for the design division, while Millie took charge of building a film division. Their Northfield, Illinois studio reflected the flexibility and freedom of the Bauhaus tradition, combining traditional graphic design work alongside a filmmaking studio. Millie compared the studio to a beehive, but noted the proximity led to collaborations and experiments that wouldn't have happened any other way. ‚ÄúWe are involved here in every step of the film process, from idea to imagery,‚Äù Millie told Rhodes Patterson shortly after moving in, ‚Äúand we find this maintains the integrity of the concept. Phonics can be manipulated with the same freedom as image. The auditory is mobilized to create mood. Images may be heard, and sound seen. It is not so much in the components of the film structure that its art resides, but rather in relationships, interaction and transitions that it assumes its significance. The pulse or rhythm of a film can produce tension, excitement and release,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIn editing, the filmmaker gives wings to the parts . . . cleaving them from their place in time and space . . . releasing them into a designer's stratosphere‚Äì‚Äìthere to be juggled, taken, rejected, extended, clipped, superimposed and recomposed.‚Äùhttp://www.theweekbehind.com/2013/02/27/meet-mort-millie/ In addition to her Goldsholl Design Associates firm work, Millie made a handful of films on her own, including the award-winning animation, Up is Down (1969). This short film looks at a study of an unconventional, young boy who is temporarily persuaded to accept others' viewpoints as his own.http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/14240 Millie, who dedicated the film to Martin Luther King, considered herself a maverick like the young boy who walks on his hands in the animated film. She once stated, \\"It is better to be utopic than myopic ‚Äì even if you're not a designer ‚Äì and especially if you are. It's not so much a matter of thinking big as thinking deep.\\" Millie died in May 2012, preceded by Mort in 1995.

It was owned and operated by two major war profiteers: Fritz Emil Schultz from Danzig,Powell 2000, p. 114 (ibidem). and a convicted war criminal, Walter C. T√∂bbens (i.e. Walther Caspar Toebbens, from Hamburg). History Schultz and T√∂bbens appeared in Warsaw in the summer of 1941, not long after the Ghetto was closed off with walls topped with barbed wire. The unemployment, hunger and malnutrition there were rampant. At first, they both acted as middlemen between the German high command and the Jewish-run workshops, and placed production orders with them. Within weeks they opened their own factories in the Ghetto using slave labour on a record scale. By spring 1942 the Stickerei Abteilung division run by Schultz at Nowolipie 44 Street had 3,000 workers making shoes, leather products, sweaters and socks for the Wehrmacht. Other divisions were making furs and wool sweaters also, guarded by the Werkschutz police. Some 15,000 Jews were working for T√∂bbens in the Warsaw Ghetto, at the Prosta Street and at the Leszno Street factories among other places. Staying with any of them was a source of envy for other Jews living in fear of deportations. In early 1943 T√∂bbens gained for himself the appointment of a Jewish deportation commissar of Warsaw in order to keep his own workforce secure and maximize profits. =Relocation= Resulting from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the destruction of an entire city district by the SS, in May 1943 T√∂bbens had transferred his businesses, including 10,000 Jewish slave workers with families spared from Treblinka, to the Poniatowa concentration camp facility set up near Lublin, part of the so-called \\"territorial solution to the Jewish Question\\" never fully realized by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Fritz Schultz took his manufacture along with 6,000 Jews and their 400 children to the nearby Trawniki concentration camp commanded by Karl Streibel. A number of vastly profitable enterprises were run by the SS in the Lublin reservation, part of the General Government during the Holocaust in Poland. SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer and Generalleutnant der Polizei Odilo Globocnik from Austria racked up millions of Reichsmarks and gold from his murderous Operation Reinhard. The business was booming, with large amounts of money initially coming from the victims of gassing, and foodstuffs requisitioned from terrorized farmers for free. But not for long. During the final phase of the Holocaust, the SS-WVHA's economic department under Oswald Pohl had given up the idea of a \\"reservation\\", partly due to the Soviet counter-offensive and the Jewish revolts.See: the uprisings at the Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps, and armed resistance in the Warsaw, Bia≈Çystok, and Vilna ghettos. The SS proceeded to shut down the Ostindustrie entirely in order to prevent further unrest. On 3 November 1943, all sub-camps of the Majdanek death camp were liquidated in Aktion Erntefest, the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war, with approximately 43,000 victims across District Lublin fatally shot in fake anti- aircraft trenches by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 (a unit of the German Order Police), augmented by a squad of Hiwis called \\"Trawniki men\\". T√∂bbens was captured in Austria by the Americans in 1946. He escaped from a train on the way to a trial in Poland and settled under an assumed name in Bavaria, where he founded a new business from his wartime profits. He revealed his identity in 1952, and died in a car accident two years later.

When activated, she becomes part of the United States Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).  Design and Construction  The vessel now known as Cape Trinity was laid down by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel, Germany, in 1977. She is a conventional RO/RO (Vehicle Carrier) ship with the superstructure aft, followed by twin funnels, and a stern ramp. She is in overall length with a lightweight displacement of and a fully loaded displacement of . For carrying US Army and Marine Corps combat vehicles, she has of cargo capacity. She can carry 340 containers plus vehicles and her hull is ice strengthened.  Service history  Commercial service = She began commercial service on 7 December 1977 with DDG Hansa Line as MV Rheinfels. She was sold to Anker Shipping GmbH, an affiliate of DDG Hansa, 13 October 1980. Following the bankruptcy of DDG Hansa, ownership passed to a Hamburg bank in December 1980. She was then sold to Christian F. Ahrenkiel of Hamburg and renamed MV Norefjord. Ownership passed in July 1981 to Heyo Janssen, Leer, Germany, she was renamed MV Radbod and was reflagged Panamanian. She was auctioned off in September 1987 to a group of German banks, and resold to Argentinean interests. Again, she was resold in November 1987 to Vericaribe CA and renamed MV Santos retaining the Panama flag. In May 1990, she was chartered to Kent Line with the name MV Canadian Forest. She was resold to Conro Shipping Ltd. of Panama in September 1991 and renamed MV Santos. Ownership passed in 1993 to South American Shipping Co., tonnage date rearranged and modified and vessel was retransferred to Conro Shipping Ltd. = US Government service = Cape Trinity was acquired by the US Government on 15 November 1994 and became part of the Ready Reserve Fleet. In January thru March 1999, Cape Trinity participated in Operation Battle Griffin, the triennial exercise of reinforcing Norway, carrying US Marines between Morehead City, North Carolina, Cheatham Annex Naval Base, Virginia, and Hommelvik, Norway. On 23 January 2003, Cape Trinity was activated and placed \\"In Service\\" from the Ready Reserve Force to haul military cargo to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She proceeded to Corpus Christi, Texas, to load military vehicles and equipment.

Early life  Lording was born on December 26, 1828, and is descended from two Pilgrim forefathers. His father was William Price Loring, who was born in Boston in 1795, and who was in early life a silversmith, and afterwards served as an officer of the customs. He was also an early California pioneer, where he remained until within a few years of his death, which occurred in Boston in 1878. His mother, whose maiden name was Eliza Harding, was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1800 and bore her husband four daughters and two sons.  Navy career  As his educational period was before the day of technical schools, he followed the usual course of preparation for mechanical engineering and served a regular apprenticeship in the machine shop with Jabez Coney. At its close, in 1851, he entered the United States Navy as a third assistant engineer, attaining, by competitive examination, the highest place in a class of 14. His entrance was just too late to give him an opportunity for participation in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and by the time the American Civil War broke out he had passed through all the junior grades and had become a chief engineer. During his service in junior grades he had been laying the foundation for his more important work when an older man and in higher positions, a portion of his shore duty having been as assistant to the engineer-in-chief of the Navy, in which capacity he had charge of the experimental work and tests of engineering devices coming before that office. While engaged in this duty he made a test of the first injector which came to this country. = Civil War = During the Civil War he was in active service the whole time, and during the first 18 months was fleet engineer of the North Atlantic Squadron, being attached to the steamer . He was on board this ship during the attacks of the on the Northern fleet in the battle of Hampton Roads on March 8‚Äì9, 1862, when was sunk and burned, and when the Minnesota also was attacked. A little later he was detached from sea duty and sent to Cincinnati, Ohio, to supervise the construction of three river and harbor monitors and also of some light-draught sea monitors building there. Subsequently, he was made general inspector of all the iron-clad steamers building west of the Allegheny Mountains, having in charge at one time 11 monitors building at Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and St. Louis. During the Civil War a number of excellent engines had been accumulated for hulls which were in process of construction, but with the close of the war all work was stopped, and after a time a board was appointed to recommend the best disposition of these engines which were stored in the various navy yards. It was about this time that the compound engine was coming into general use, and the same board was directed to make a study of the compound engine with a view to its introduction in naval vessels. Of this board, Loring was senior member, and associated with him was Chief Engineer Charles Hinckley Baker. = Study of compound engines = After a very exhaustive study of the subject, they recommended the introduction of compound engines and the abandonment of the simple form, and the conversion of a number of the engines which were on hand into compound engines. Four sets of these simple engines were so converted and were fitted to the , , , and . The tests of these engines were very satisfactory and showed a coal economy for short runs of not much over two pounds of coal per horsepower hour. This study of the compound engine made it natural that Loring should be selected as the representative of the Navy Department when, in 1874, he and Charles E. Emery made an elaborate series of trials of the engines of the revenue cutters , , , and , to determine by actual test the relative economies of compound and simple engines, designed for the same work in similar hulls, and also to secure reliable and authoritative data with respect to the economy of steam jacketing. These tests were the first of the kind conducted under circumstances of entire reliability, with the result that the report of the trials was republished all over the world and is still quoted in all the text books on steam engineering. = Fleet engineering = Loring's next tour of sea duty was as a fleet engineer of the Asiatic Squadron on the , where he had as his chief assistant, George W. Melville, who later became his successor as Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering. There was nothing especially eventful in this cruise, and at its end, in 1880, he was assigned as the head of the steam engineering department of the New York Navy Yard. This was the period of greatest inactivity in the history of the Navy, and there was little to do, even for a very active man, except routine work. During this tour, however. Loring was senior member of a board that made a test of the machinery of the Anthracite, a little yacht with a triple-expansion engine working with 600 pounds pressure. The experiments were valuable as showing that, with the form of apparatus on board the Anthracite, there was no such gain in economy as to warrant the tremendous pressure carried, while it involved numerous practical difficulties. In 1881, he was a member of what is known as the First Naval Advisory Board, appointed by Secretary William H. Hunt to formulate a shipbuilding program for the Navy which he might submit to Congress. The personnel of this advisory board was distinguished in all its branches, and the work they did made possible our splendid fleet of today, as they definitely decided to abandon wooden hulls for those of iron and steel, and for general progress in every respect. In 1882, he was a member of another important board known as the Navy Yard Board, of which Admiral Stephen Luce was senior member. The duty of this board was to visit all the navy yards of the country for the purpose of determining which of them might with advantage and economy be closed. It was a delicate task, but the report, when finally approved, gave general satisfaction, and its recommendations were carried out. = Bureau of Steam Engineering = On the retirement of the engineer-in- chief, William H. Shock, only two successors were thought of, one of whom was Loring, and his merit and thorough qualification for the position were so well recognized that the appointment came to him entirely unsought. This was in 1884, during the administration of President Chester A. Arthur. Secretary William E. Chandler was presiding over the Navy Department at this time, and it was under his supervision that the four vessels commonly known as the Roach cruisers, the , , , and , were built. Part of the scheme of building the new navy was the organization of what was known as an advisory board, composed of two civilians and a number of naval officers. Owing to this regime the bureaus were not given the same free hand that has obtained since the advisory board was discontinued, although they did valuable work in the details of designs. Forced draft was used on these new vessels, after having been tried on two others‚Äîthe Alliance and Swatara‚Äîunder Loring's direction. In 1885, with the advent of a new administration, there was a general spirit of unrest about the Navy Department from what seemed to be a prevailing belief that whatever was, was wrong. The air was filled with rumors of intended changes, among them one which promised to cause a violation of the contract labor law, as it was actually seriously under consideration to import a British engineer and put him in charge of the design of machinery. From this intent and other indications it became evident to Loring that he did not enjoy the Secretary's confidence, and he tendered his resignation. After leaving the Bureau of Steam Engineering he was made senior member of the Experimental Board of Naval Officers at the New York Navy Yard, which board, under his direction, conducted many exceedingly valuable experiments. Among the most important were the competitive tests of water-tube boilers to determine the type that should be used on the coast-defence vessel , and it may be well here to call attention to the fact that this was the first case on record where a boiler had ever been run for 24 hours when burning more than 50 pounds of coal per square foot of grate. Another very important series of experiments conducted by Loring were those on the boilers of the torpedo boat , to determine the economy of evaporation with different air pressures and rates of combustion. These experiments have proven of the greatest interest, and form a very valuable collection of engineering data. A number of clever devices had to be schemed out to carry on these tests, and the whole success was a great credit to Loring and the board.  Retirement  Having reached the age limit in December 1890, he was placed on the retired list; but having always been a man of very vigorous physique, he did not give up active employment and was for a time consulting engineer to the United States and Brazil Mail Steamship Company. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War he was recalled to active duty and assigned as inspector of engineering work in New York City. This record shows the active naval work of Loring, but to those who knew him well, this side of his character was less important than the social one. Although a man of great dignity, he was what is now called \\"a good mixer,\\" being most companionable and a delightful associate. He wrote well and was a good speaker, but he was perhaps at his best in a party of moderate size where his keen sense of humor, his genial personality and his remarkable skill as a raconteur made him a most enjoyable associate. He was for two years president of the Engineers' Club of New York, which is a sure test of popularity and wide acquaintance in the engineering world. He was also president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the highest honor which his branch of the profession could confer. He was a vice-president of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers from its formation until his death, and, as long as his health permitted, was very active in its council and general meetings. He was a member of our own Society from the beginning. He had also been very active in the Army and Navy Club of New York, filling various offices and acting as its secretary for several years. Lording succumbed to an attack of paralysis. Loring's career covered almost the whole period of progress in marine engineering from the side-wheel engine and box boilers down to the triple- expansion engine and steam turbine, forced draft and the water-tube boiler. In nearly all of this progress he played an important part, and he could justly feel that he had not only done his duty but had been a factor in the continued advancement of the profession and the service he loved so well.

The suit noted that the baby powders contained zinc oxide, which can contain lead, and that babies can be exposed if they inhale the compounds, and/or can absorb them through irritated skin, and/or could ingest them if they get the powder on their hands or mouth.Jane Kay, \\"Group wants lead out of baby powder.\\" San Francisco Examiner, November 19, 1999 Accessed March 8, 2015 Ultimately, several manufacturers agreed to significant reductions in the lead in the products, up to 80% less for the products that had tested highest for lead. In a similar suit, CEH and the California Attorney General sued makers of Kaopectate for high lead content in its products; the company agreed to reduce the levels of lead in its children's Kaopectate by 95%, and by 80% in its adult variety.

The quartet was commissioned by the Endellion Quartet with contributions from the Holst Foundation.Ad√®s, Thomas (1994). Arcadiana: Program Note. Retrieved September 9, 2016. Structure The work consists of seven movements played without pause: #Venezia notturna #Das klinget so herrlich, das klinget so sch√∂n #Auf dem Wasser zu singen #Et... (tango mortale) #L'Embarquement #O Albion #Lethe Style The piece is written to evoke images of the idyll, and does so by employing many extended string techniques, such as harmonics and glissandi. The dynamic range is wide, with rapid changes, and the piece is rhythmically very complex. The second movement is inspired by Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, and in the closing bars quotes the aria Der H√∂lle Rache. The third movement alludes to Schubert's Lied of the same name. The central movement, in a departure from the general style of the quartet, is loud and brash, an exaggeration of the tango. It is inspired by Nicolas Poussin's painting Et in Arcadia ego. Ad√®s makes use of Bart√≥k pizzicati in this movement to add to the staccato style. L'Embarquement is inspired by the painting The Embarkation for Cythera by Jean-Antoine Watteau. By far the most tonally and metrically traditional movement, O Albion is slow, quiet and nostalgic. The main focus is a 'sighing' motif, which is passed around the quartet, before the music comes to rest with a gently unresolved perfect cadence. The final movement is named after the river of oblivion in Greek mythology. Short, soft, high-pitched figures are played by the violins and the viola, with many harmonics, whilst the cello plays a high and lyrical melody. The piece finishes with long, overlapping notes passed around the quartet, forming a melody out of perfect fifths. The notes are double-stopped, creating a 'spacious' effect which evokes the river which the movement represents. Reception Arcadiana has been praised by music critics. Reviewing a 1999 performance by the Borromeo String Quartet, Allan Kozinn of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Ades's Arcadiana, written in 1994, is meant to be an evocation of paradise in seven short movements. Paradise for Mr. Ades is a place of complexity rather than simplistic loveliness; in fact, the idyllic and the terrifying are closely intertwined here. One moment dark, sliding string figures evoke a dance of death; the next is a serene paean to England in slow, gracefully consonant chordal passages.\\" He continued, \\"Mr. Ades evokes a pantheon of sorts in fleeting, subtle, half-submerged references to Mozart, Schubert, Elgar and Wagner.

Facts Coutts & Co gave Mr Stock‚Äôs company a ¬£200,000 overdraft. Mr Stock gave a personal guarantee for it. Then came a winding up petition, as the account was ¬£500 in credit. But by the time the petition was advertised, the account was overdrawn by ¬£121,875 and ¬£190,000 by the time the petition was granted. The bank honoured cheques in favour of third parties, most of which were three companies controlled by Mr Stock. Coutts & Co wanted to enforce the guarantee. Mr Stock argued the Insolvency Act 1986's section 127 prevented the bank from debiting the account, and so the bank could not recover from him. Judgment The Bank was held to be entitled to the full sum claimed, as it was a debt owed by the Debtor.par. 18 Lightman J noted that \\"[t]he authorities are in disarray and the state of the law is uncertain, if not confused.\\"par. 4 He then proceeded to identify \\"the principles which would be expected to operate in a case where Section 127 applies\\":par. 7 #The invalidation of dispositions of a company's assets after the date of presentation of a winding up petition is part of the statutory scheme designed to prevent the directors of a company, when liquidation is imminent, from disposing of the company's assets to the prejudice of its creditors and to preserve those assets for the benefit of the general body of creditors. #The retrospective invalidation effected by Section 127 does not change what happened between the date of the petition and the date of the winding up order #The invalidation is limited to dispositions of property: it does not invalidate a company's assumption of liabilities, and it has no impact on the company's use, consumption or exhaustion of its assets. #Presentation of the winding up petition has no impact on the powers of the directors of the company, the authority of the company's agents or the powers of disposition of the company. #If the acts of the bank of honouring cheques drawn on a company's overdrawn account constitute payments by the bank (by way of loan to the company) of its own monies to the party in whose favour the cheques are drawn, the transaction is outside Section 127, for there is no disposition of the company's property. #The acts of the bank in honouring cheques drawn on a company's overdrawn account constitute (i) loans of the sums in question by the bank to the company and (ii) payment by the bank as agent of the company of the sums loaned as monies of the company to the party in whose favour the cheques are drawn. The first act is not a disposition of the company's money and is therefore outside Section 127; but the second act does constitute a disposition to the payee by the company within Section 127 and is recoverable by the liquidator from the payee.

He was a co-founder of the Coxe Brothers and Company coal mining operation which became the largest individual producer of anthracite coal in the United States at the time. He was instrumental in the formation of Lehigh University as a mining school in 1865 and founded the Institute of Miners and Mechanics in 1879. He served as president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers from 1878 to 1880 and of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers from 1893 to 1894. He served as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 21st district from 1881 to 1884. Early life and education Coxe was born June 4, 1849 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Charles Sidney Coxe (1791‚Äì1879) and Anna Maria Brinton (1801‚Äì1876). His great-great grandfather was Daniel Coxe, his grandfather was Tench Coxe and his cousin was George B. McClellan. Coxe graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1858 with degrees in Chemistry and Physics. He spent six months after graduation in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania conducting a topographical geology survey of his grandfather's 35,000 acre estate under the supervision of Benjamin Smith Lyman. In 1860 he traveled to Europe and studied for 2 years at the Ecole des mines in Paris, France and for 1 year at Freiberg Mining Academy in Freiberg, Saxony. He spent an additional 2 years studying the mines in England and continental Europe and returned to the United States in 1864. He served during the U.S. Civil War on the staff of Major General George Meade. Career Eckley Coxe's grandfather, Tench Coxe, had purchased 800,000 acres of land in Pennsylvania and urged his heirs to hold on to the land as he suspected coal would be found in the region. Tench's son, Charles, was able to retain ownership of 35,000 acres and left it to his sons including Eckley. Coal was found in the Coxe owned land and the Coxe Brothers and Company mining company was founded in 1865 with the first mine opened in Drifton, Pennsylvania. By the late 1800s, the company was the largest independent producer of anthracite coal with nearly 4,000 employees, coal shipments in excess of 1.5 million tons and land assets valued at $10 million. The Coxe Brothers & Company organization became the Cross Creek Coal Company led by Coxe, and in 1890 Coxe organized and became president of the Delaware, Susquehanna and Schuykill Railroad. In 1869, Coxe married Sophia Georgina Fisher. Together they worked to improve the lives of miners by building a fully functional hospital at the mines to help miners injured on the job. He lectured frequently before scientific bodies. He published several technical papers on mining and translated the first volume of Julius Weisbach's \\"Mechanics of Engineering and Construction of Machines\\" from German to English in 1872. He was instrumental in the founding of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania as a mining school in 1865 and served on its board of trustees until his death. In 1877, his mines were selected by the Columbia College School of Mines for their study program due to the quality of the mines. He founded the Institute for Miners and Mechanics in 1879 in Freeland, Pennsylvania. The intent of the school was to teach math, science and English to the men working in the mines. He was strongly anti-union and defeated two powerful unions in one of the longest strikes in the coal industry from September 1887 to March 1888. He was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In 1880 Coxe was one of the original founders of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He served as the president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers from May 1878 to February 1880 and as vice president of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers from April 1880 to November 1881. Coxe was an inventor who was granted over 100 patents. He developed a long steel tape for the measurement of land by surveyors and the traveling grate, which he patented in 1893. He served as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 21st district from 1881 to 1884. He served as chairman of the Pennsylvania delegation to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1884. He died on May 13, 1895 of pneumonia and was interred at Saint James Episcopal Churchyard in Drifton, Pennsylvania. Legacy Eckley Miners' Village in Pennsylvania was named for him in 1857 by his father. The Coxe Hall (1910) at Lehigh University, originally a mining laboratory, is named after him. Coxe was admitted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for his work on the traveling-grate furnace.  Publications  * Eckley B.

In the beginning of the 90s he and his partners established Vikomt company which had a great break through on the market. He sold his share of the company in the middle of the 90s. He used the acquired money to buy at the time small Regiobanka in Karlovy Vary (today\`s Hypoteƒçn√≠ banka); he subsequently sold it to IPB at a very advantageous price. Already at that time he was considered to be a very rich man. In 1995 he participated in the creation of free community of investors around Motoinvest whose participants gained shares in several banks and investment funds thanks to buying cheap shares after the privatization. Forced termination of their activities has led to the rapid sale of assets of the majority of participants in this community. At the turn of the millennium, after several years in seclusion, Tykaƒç returned to the world of big business. Share trades (mainly electricity company ƒåEZ and Telef√≥nica) and currency rate movement speculations are probably the biggest source of Tykaƒç\`s billion-dollar assets. In 2006, he entered the energy sector by investing in a minority stake in the Czech Coal mining group.

Career  After completing military service, he worked as a technician in the TOS ƒåel√°kovice. In 1990 he started to import and sell computer equipment, and later, in 1991, he founded Vikomt company with three other partners, which became one of the top three companies on the market in the first half of the nineties In 1995 he sold his share and used the money (up to one billion dollars) to take over a small Regiobanka in Hradec Kralove, which he subsequently sold to IPB. IPB transformed it into Czechomoravian mortgage bank. The proceeds from this transaction were the source for his further activities. Tykaƒç gained a significant portion of his assets while trading with shares of the coupon privatization in the nineties. He participated in the creation of a free group of people and companies around Motoinvest (brokerage house) which the media later called \\"the Motoinvest group\\". The group shared common vision of the emergence of strong Czech financial and industrial group. Individual members of this group were massively buying shares from small shareholders during the privatization. Thanks to these activities the group gained shares in a number of large investment funds (e.g. funds managed by Komerƒçn√≠ banka, ƒåSOB, ≈Ωivnobanka, CS Funds, Creditanstalt or PPF), several banks (Credit banka Plze≈à, Agrobanka) and many other major companies (e.g. Slov√°ck√© Machinery, Gravel and sand pits of Olomouc, ...). In autumn 1996, after the purchase of a significant share in the then state- majority-owned ƒåesk√° spo≈ôitelna and an attempt to gain influence and position among its authorities a hard clash between \\"group Motoinvest\\" on one side and the ƒåNB together with the then largest banks (Czech Savings Bank, Commercial Bank, ƒåSOB) on the other started blazing. The result was a forced administration of Agrobanka by ƒåNB. This forced investors around Motoinvest to a rapid sale of their assets; it caused their forced departure from the Czech capital market and extinction of the group. At the beginning of the new millennium, after several years in seclusion, Tykaƒç started to invest into equities on the Prague Stock Exchange and speculative trading in foreign currencies. He was trading with shares of Telef√≥nica or Czech Radiokomunikace, but his best-known business has been a massive purchase of ƒåEZ shares at a time, when one share cost less than 100 CZK. Within a few years he was able to sell the same share for more than 1000 CZK. He was sure that ƒåEZ fusion with various regional distributors into \\"SuperƒåEZ\\" will result into a significant increase in the value of the investments in a relatively short time. According to some sources, he earned up to ten billion CZK solely on this transaction. In 2002 he was involved in securing funding for the company EC Group, which won the tender for the purchase of receivables from the Czech Consolidation Agency in the nominal amount of 38 billion CZK. Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) has been called the \\"bad bank\\" of the state, into which the problem loans from the privatization of large banks after debt relief were redirected. EC Group, which was then owned by former collaborators of Pavel Tykaƒç Jan Dienstl and Pavel ≈†imek paid 3.4 billion CZK for a package of receivables.. The group overpaid such renowned consortiums as Goldman Sachs / Flow East or PPF / CS First Boston, by about half a billion CZK. In 2003, the EC Group sued ƒåKA and demanded the return of about 570 mil CZK against portions of the claims that ƒåKA never owned due to legal shortcomings and therefore the claims could not even be sold. ƒåKA eventually returned about 440 mil CZK based on a judicial verdict.. In 2006 Tykaƒç invested via a Cyprus company Indoverse Investment Limited into a minority share in one of the leading mining and energy groups in the Czech Republic Czech Coal. At the end of 2010 Indoverse Investment Limited became the sole 100% owner of the Czech Coal group. In the summer of 2013 Litv√≠novsk√° uheln√° a. s., which operates a ƒåSA mine and Chvaletice power plant purchased from the ƒåEZ group, separated from the Czech Coal group. This business move created a new group on the market called Severn√≠ energetick√°, in which Tykaƒç owns a 40% share. Apart from his holding in Severn√≠ energetick√°, Tykaƒç also operates on the real estate and financial markets. He has been described as ‚Äúa person with the reputation of an unscrupulous player and a secretive pirate of Czech business comparable to Gordon Gekko ‚Ä¶, professing greed as the highest virtue‚Äù.Lidov√Ω noviny, 19 October 2011. ‚ÄúRoman wants to destroy the pirate of Czech business. Who is Pavel Tykaƒç?‚Äù (Czech)  Criminal investigations  Tykaƒç and the CS Funds = His earlier activities on the financial market in the 1990s included the acquisition of CS Fund, the asset manager of three smaller investment funds, which Tykaƒç divested himself of just a few weeks before it was ‚Äòtunneled‚Äô or defrauded in March 1997. The most valuable acquisition of his investment company, Motoinvest, established in 1991, however, was Agrobanka. It was this company that financed most of Tykaƒç‚Äôs activities, which before long led it to the brink of ruin as the bank was unable to meet its liabilities, leading to the intervention the Czech National Bank to rescue its clients by pumping CZK 20 billion into it. Tykaƒç also acquired shares through Motoinvest in other banks whose capital was subsequently passed on to companies and funds linked to Tykaƒç whereupon those banks also went bankrupt as a result of these transactions, e.g. Kreditn√≠ banka Plze≈à, and Ekoagrobanka. As a result, he is often called \\"the pest of the capital market\\" in the Czech Republic, an appellation which he failed to have the Czech courts prohibit the magazine Respekt from using in connection with his person.Spurn√Ω, J., √öƒçet pro Pavla Tykaƒçe [A bill for Pavel Tykaƒç], Respekt, 13 August 2006 Tykaƒç was investigated by the police in 2006 over the tunneling of CS Fund, but the prosecution was later suspended. Many of his former associates have been convicted of financial crimes and have often ended up behind bars, although Tykaƒç himself has always remained at liberty. Investigations against him, however, continue. In 2012, Franti≈°ek Bu≈°ek alleged in court that he assisted Tykaƒç in defrauding CS Fund of CZK 1.23 billion. Tykaƒç said the allegation was the result of an earlier failed attempt by Bu≈°ek to blackmail him.Lidov√Ω noviny, 29 February 2012.‚ÄúI tunnelled CS Fund with Tykaƒç, says court witness (Czech) One of the media monitored cases associated with Pavel Tykaƒç are the CS Funds. 1,3 bil CZK was fraudulently withdrawn from the funds in 1997. Four offenders were convicted in 2001 (legally effective in 2007.) In 2006 prosecution of Tykaƒç and another five people started. The prosecution of Tykaƒç and other three suspects was terminated after a review by the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office in 2008 with the conclusion that the conduct of these persons in connection with CS Funds had not been a criminal offense. The remaining two suspects were indicted in the same year, but were subsequently freed by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2012. Tykaƒç\`s involvement in the money withdrawal from the CS Funds became a subject of criminal prosecution again in 2013, when criminal proceedings against him were resumed. New facts that led to the restoration of the process were represented by a particularly dubious testimony of people who either changed their testimony or refused to testify in the retrial. Based on this testimony, the police and the prosecution tried to secure Tykaƒç\`s property twice. In both cases the court found the decision as unjustified and it was canceled. In March 2015 the police investigation ended after two and a half years with a recommendation for indictment submitted to the Chief Prosecutor's Office in Prague. In December 2015 the High Prosecutor's Office in Prague terminated the prosecution against Tykaƒç. State prosecutor Zdenƒõk Matula stated in the preamble that no evidence of Tykaƒç\`s guilt had been found. This verdict thus ended 19 years of CS Funds cause. In his interview for Forbes magazine in 2014 Tykaƒç stated that, in his opinion, the money from the funds disappeared during the management of its new owners, to whom the funds were sold by the Motoinvest group after pressure caused by a hostile attack of ƒåNB. This caused a wave of inspections of tax authorities, the Stock Exchange, Securities Office, a wave of police interrogations and strongly negative media atmosphere directed against \\"Motoinvest group\\". Further examples of Tykaƒç‚Äôs alleged unscrupulousness include posting letters to the wives of shareholders who were refusing to sell him a Czech Coal competitor, Sokolovsk√© uheln√©, urging them to talk their husbands into the deal, and the way he dealt with a run-down but listed residence he owned in the exclusive Prague quarter of Vinohrady ‚Äì it mysteriously caught fire twice and was eventually demolished without permission. = End of chapter \\"CS Funds\\" = Probably the definite end for CS funds was caused by Czech Television, which on February 11, 2020 broadcast in its main news program CT Events the following post: ‚ÄúCzech Television apologizes to Pavel Tykaƒç for having made a false and manipulative statement on December 29, 2015 in the program CT Events in a post called The Final End of the CS Fund Case: \\\\- that Pavel Tykaƒç is responsible for the tunneling of CS Funds, \\\\- that Pavel Tykaƒç was involved in committing fraud in CS Funds, \\\\- that Pavel Tykaƒç was involved in the purchase of the shares of Dr≈Øbe≈æ P≈ô√≠≈°ovice by CS Funds, \\\\- and that as a result of transactions involving Mr. Pavel Tykaƒç, the banks went bankrupt.‚Äù  Involvement into the energy sector  Tykaƒç kept a very low profile from the late 1990s only to re-emerge in 2006 with his purchase of shares in Czech Coal, since when he has aggressively defended the price demands of the company and lobbied for the cancellation of the brown coal mining limits in North Bohemia, beyond which lie huge coal reserves. Tykaƒç is the effective owner of Czech Coal with 50% of its shares. He originally purchased a 40% share in the company in spring 2006 and then quickly increased that share to 49% for allegedly nearly CZK 10 billon.Hospoda≈ôsk√Ω noviny, 3 September 2009. ‚ÄúMoves among the coal barons.

Eight years of conflict, which began even before Tykaƒç joined the coal business, was terminated by a mutual agreement of the parties and by signing a 50-year contract about coal supply to the power plant Poƒçerady. = Hard clash with EPH because of power plant Opatovice = In 2012 Tykaƒç\`s Czech Coal terminated the contract for the supply of coal to the power plant Opatovice, which belongs to the Energy and Industrial Holding (EPH) owned by K≈ôet√≠nsk√Ω and JT Bank. Tykaƒç justified this step by EPH having claims of half a billion CZK. The conflict between Czech Coal and EPH ended with amicable settlement in 2014. Part of the deal was the mutual termination of litigation. = The dispute with Sokolovsk√° uheln√° = Since 2006 Tykaƒç supported the minority shareholder of Sokolov coal company Jan Krou≈æeck√Ω in his conflict with the majority shareholders. Subsequent litigation lasted for years. In 2015 the whole issue ended in an agreement when Krou≈æeck√Ω sold his shares to the company, that was now completely controlled by its majority shareholders Franti≈°ek ≈†tƒõp√°nek and Jaroslav Rokos. The price of Krou≈æeck√Ω\`s 30% share of the company was supposedly around 4-5 billion CZK. There are speculations that most of this money was received by Tykaƒç, who had previously bought Krou≈æeck√Ω\`s share. Only ≈†tƒõp√°nek publicly addressed ending of the dispute by saying that the company bought Krou≈æeck√Ω\`s share, there was a longstanding dispute settlement and that the parties consider the transaction to be positive and beneficial. = The case with Respekt = In 2013 weekly magazine Respekt published an information about the alleged freezing of Tykaƒç\`s assets of roughly 19 bil CZK by Swiss claimants. This should have occurred due to the renewed prosecution in the case of stripped assets of CS Funds in the Czech Republic. Tykaƒç denied any blocking of his assets with a statement that it is a deliberate or unconscious attempt to prevent the signing of a contract between ƒåEZ and Czech Coal about a long-term supply of coal to power plant Poƒçerady.

One can see the bell tower of the sanctuary near the Fidenza gate of the A1 autostrada. It is about west of Parma. History In 1512, Veronica da Correggio founded a Dominican monastery in Fontanellato. A brotherhood dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and a chapel were established in the monastery church in the second half of the sixteenth century. In 1641, construction of a larger church began; it was inaugurated on 18 August 1660 with the coronation of the statue by the Bishop of Fidenza Alessandro Pallavicini. The front was completed in 1680. Construction of a new convent began in 1672. In 1769, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma took the sanctuary to the Dominicans who were then reassigned in 1775. With the suppression of religious orders, by Napoleon I in 1805, the convent became the school of the Canossians Sisters and the Boys' School of St. Stephen, named \\"Corpo dell'Industria\\". In 1816, Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, granted the convent to Dominican sisters of Colorno. The monastery was restored in 1822 and the church in 1858‚Äì1860. With the suppression of religious orders in 1866 the building of the convent passed to the municipality, from which it was given-back to Dominicans in 1879. In August 1903, pope Pius X elevated the church to the rank of minor basilica.Catholic.org Basilicas in Italy In the years 1913‚Äì1920 a new monumental neo-baroque facade was replaced by the architect Lamberto Cusani, joined by an orphanage, opened in 1925. In the same year it was placed in front of sanctuary of a bronze statue of blessed cardinal Andrea Carlo Ferrari, by sculptor Amleto Cataldi. The orphanage during the World War II was used as a prison and school for officials- soldiers. It was bombed by the Allies, reopened in 1948 and closed in 1982. In 1965, an access road to the shrine opened; it includes a portico. In 1978 the monastery was equipped with an internal cloister.  The structure  The church has a form of Latin cross, with a single nave with four chapels. It also has a transept and a small choir area. The paintings are located on the altars of seven chapels, and a wooden crucifix is in the eighth chapel. They were built in 1663. The facade of 1680 hosts four marble statues (Saint Dominic, Saint Joseph, Saint Rose of Lima and Saint Louis Bertrand). There are some ex-voto in the sacristy of sanctuary, in the gallery of the graces received. Since 1699 in the sanctuary there are two pipe organ keyboards. They are used to perform concerts and solemn masses. The organists, as of ????, are father Daniele Mazzoleni, Roberto Marchesi, and Leonardo Pontremoli.

John Francis Amherst Cecil (30 June 1890 ‚Äì 22 October 1954) was the first secretary of the British Embassy, Washington, known for his marriage to Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt. Early life John Francis Amherst Cecil was born on 30 June 1890 in London, England. He was the third son of Lord William Cecil (1854‚Äì1943) and Mary Rothes Margaret Tyssen-Amherst, 2nd Baroness Amherst of Hackney (1857‚Äì1919). After the death of his mother in 1919, his father remarried to Violet Maud (n√©e Freer) Collyer. As his eldest brother, Capt. Hon. William Amherst Cecil, predeceased their mother, William's eldest son, succeeded their mother as the 3rd Baron Amherst of Hackney. His father, a Groom-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria until her death in 1901 and an Extra Gentleman Usher from 1924 under King George V until 1937, was a younger son of the William Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Exeter and Lady Georgina Sophia Pakenham, the daughter of Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford. His maternal grandfather was William Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney. He attended Eton College and Oxford University. Career He became the first secretary of the British Embassy in Washington in 1923. After his marriage in 1924, he resigned from his diplomatic post and moved to Biltmore, North Carolina. Personal life In 1924, he married Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt at All Souls Cathedral in Biltmore Village. Cornelia was the only child of the late George Washington Vanderbilt II and the former Edith Stuyvesant Dresser. The following year, Cornelia's mother married Peter Goelet Gerry, a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, in London. Together, Cornelia and John were the parents of two children: * George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil (b. 1925), who married Nancy Owen (1930‚Äì2016). * William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil (1928‚Äì2017) who married Mary Lee Ryan (1931‚Äì2017), a first cousin of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, as their mothers, Janet Norton Lee and Marion Merritt Lee, were sisters. Around 1932, reportedly finding life at Biltmore too dull, his wife moved to New York City to study art, leaving Cecil to manage Biltmore. A few months later, she moved to Paris where she divorced him in 1934, dyed her hair bright pink, and changed her name to Nilcha. After her 1934 move abroad, she never returned to Biltmore or the United States again. After Paris, she moved to London, where she met and married Captain Vivian Francis Bulkeley-Johnson in October 1949. Bulkeley-Johnson, the aide-de-camp to the 9th Duke of Devonshire when he was the Governor General of Canada from 1916 to 1918, served in the offices of the Imperial War Cabinet in World War I and in the Air Ministry.

It was established in 1931 by Charles Albert Verschoor with financial backing from Ann Arbor mayor William E. Brown, Jr., and a group of local business leaders. IRC manufactured numerous different radios, many bearing the Kadette name, including the first mass-produced AC/DC radio, the first pocket radio, and the first clock radio. Due to the seasonal nature of radio sales, the company attempted to diversify its offerings with a product that would sell well during the summer, eventually settling on a camera that would become the Argus. In 1939, IRC sold its radio-manufacturing business to its former General Sales Manager, W. Keene Jackson, although his new Kadette Radio Corporation only survived for a year before it went defunct. After World War II, International Industries and its International Research division became wholly owned subsidiaries of Argus, Inc., after which point the International name ceased to exist.  History  Establishment = The International Radio Corporation was founded in 1931 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the creation of Charles Albert Verschoor, who had begun making radios in the 1920s. Described as a \\"colorful old-time promoter\\" in a January 1945 Fortune magazine article and as a \\"go-getting inventor\\" by Mary Hunt, Verschoor had previous experience in automobile manufacturing as well. The company was initially financed with $10,000 raised by Ann Arbor mayor William E. Brown, Jr., and a group of local business leaders who desired to create a new local company with substantial potential for growth and job creation during the Great Depression. It was based out of a former furniture factory located at 405 Fourth Street on Ann Arbor's west side. = Early products and profitability = Kadette Model H (1932), made of Bakelite IRC debuted its first radio, the International Duo, on August 7, 1931; it was named for its ability to receive both local longwave and European shortwave radio signals. It measured by by , at a time when most table radios measured in length without their separate speaker. A 1933 Kadette radio receiver Shortly thereafter, IRC introduced the Kadette, the first mass-produced AC/DC radio; it was a four-tube, radio small enough to be easily portable that featured an innovative plastic cabinet. This cabinet material, called Bakelite, was fairly cheap to produce and helped IRC to turn a substantial profit on its radio sales. Manufactured by the Chicago Molded Products Company, the Kadette's plastic cabinet was the first to be used on a radio, although its Gothic styling gave it a fairly traditional appearance. The radio also boasted an innovative new circuit design, while its ability to operate on either alternating (AC) or direct current (DC) allowed it to operate without a power transformer, resulting in it being cheaper, smaller, and lighter than its competitors; it also allowed the Kadette to be plugged into typical household wall sockets. Furthermore, IRC released a kit that instructed customers how to modify their Kadettes for battery-powered mobile applications, such as in railroad cars and automobiles; in the words of Robert E. Mayer, this kit \\"effectively started the car radio market\\". The popularity of the Kadette led to \\"almost immediate profitability\\" for IRC, and by 1933 it was the only company in Ann Arbor that was still able to pay dividends to its shareholders. During the early 1930s, Ann Arbor was less adversely affected by the Great Depression than Detroit or most other Michigan communities, although lost orders and inability to pay dividends were common occurrences for Ann Arbor-based companies. = Later products and financial difficulties = Following after the Kadette were a variety of other models, many of which were innovative in their own right: the Kadette Jr., the world's first pocket radio; the Kadette Jewel, the original Kadette's successor that was available in five different color combinations; the Kadette Classic, built with three different types of plastic; and the Kadette Clockette, which resembled a small mantel clock and was available in four different wooden case styles. IRC also introduced a number of related accessories, including the Tunemaster, a portable radio remote control, and the Kadette Autime, the first mass-produced clock radio. In 1937, as its sales had climbed to $2,700,000, IRC introduced a 10-tube Kadette radio for $19.95, a price comparable with many four- and five- tube sets when its 10-tube competitors cost $100 or more. With three ballast tubes, these 10-tube radios were met with largely negative reviews; in the words of Alan Voorhees, they were \\"$20 sets with extra ballast tubes thrown in\\". They were also reminiscent of 10-tube radios that Verschoor had built between 1925 and 1930 under the \\"Arborphone\\" name, which had only five functioning tubes alongside five superfluous ones intended simply to impress prospective customers. Furthermore, when radio dealers sold IRC's 10-tube Kadettes, they achieved profit margins of 15% at most, far less than what they could earn selling premium models made by competitors. After the company began requiring its dealers to stock its slower selling units in order to also have access to its 10-tube Kadettes, some dealers resorted to giving unauthorized discounts to move the less attractive models, resulting in their total profit margins on the whole Kadette line falling to as low as 5% in some cases. As their profit margins fell, many dealers dropped Kadettes from their catalogs altogether; while IRC made efforts to reverse this trend, in many cases irreparable damage had already been done. = Diversification = An Argus C3, produced by Argus between 1939 and 1966 While IRC's radio business was initially successful, it was generally seasonal in nature; due to better reception in winter as well as general patterns of behavior before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, sales of radios were much higher during the winter months than during the summer. This prompted Verschoor to explore possibilities for expanding the company's product line in order to reduce the slack periods caused by the seasonal variation in its radio sales. Looking for a product that could be produced relatively cheaply and that would also sell well during the summer months, he decided upon an inexpensive Leica- inspired camera that would ultimately become the Argus, which launched to nearly instant success in 1936. That same year, when IRC had 150 employees, it sold its Kadette AC/DC patents to RCA. = Final years = In 1938, Verschoor departed from IRC after being pressured to leave. By the early 1940s the company was being run by a \\"modern management team\\". In 1939, International Industries sold its radio-manufacturing business to the company's former General Sales Manager, W. Keene Jackson. After renaming it the Kadette Radio Corporation, Jackson expressed his desire to expand its product line by adding television sets, vowing that the new company would \\"employ every technical resource to bring the price of efficient television reception to the point where every American home can enjoy this new art as quickly as possible.\\" However, Jackson's company suffered from the same problems that IRC had, and just a year after its establishment it was already out of business. While its radio business had faltered, International Industries had found success in the camera and optical equipment fields with its Argus line; by 1942, Argus, Inc.'s sales had climbed to $4,800,000, and during World War II the company employed 1,200 people. After the war, International Industries and its International Research division became wholly owned subsidiaries of Argus, Inc., and shortly thereafter the International name ceased to exist.

Huron in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was built in 1940 as the Eastern Michigan Motorbus Terminal, and operated as a bus station until its demolition in 2014. It was designed by the Cleveland-based architects Banfield and Cumming, in partnership with Ann Arbor architect Douglas Loree, in an Art Deco style. Between 1988 and 2001, it was listed as an Individual Historic Property on the Ann Arbor Register of Historic Places. The Bus Depot was demolished in 2014 to make way for a six-story, 110-room hotel on the property, although its facade and marquee are being preserved and will be incorporated into the new hotel. It served as Ann Arbor's Greyhound station until shortly before its demolition in 2014. It was also both the last surviving example of Streamline Moderne architecture and the last public Art Deco structure in Ann Arbor.  History  The former interurban station at 116 W. Huron, served by Greyhound buses, circa 1939 Located at 116 W. Huron, the Ann Arbor Bus Depot was designed by the Cleveland-based architects Banfield and Cumming, in partnership with local architect Douglas Loree, and was built in 1940 as the Eastern Michigan Motorbus Terminal. It cost $60,000 to build, and was at the time considered one of the most modern bus stations in the United States. It was dedicated by Ann Arbor mayor Walter C. Sadler on September 5, 1940. The building operated as a bus station from 1940 until its demolition in 2014. Originally, it was owned by the Eastern Michigan Motorbus Company, and was used by the Blue Goose, Greyhound, and Short Way bus lines. By 1952, Blue Goose service had ended and had been replaced by the Bee Line bus company. Prior to the creation of the Bus Depot, the site was home to an Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway depot and transformer tower that were built in 1898. The interurban system served the location until its demise in 1929, at which point it was succeeded by a replacement bus service.  Design  One of a number of bus stations built in the Art Deco style during the 1930s and 1940s, the Ann Arbor Bus Depot was featured in the book Modern Bus Terminals and Post Houses. Similarly designed Banfield and Cumming bus depots were also built in Kalamazoo and Windsor during 1940. The exterior design of the Bus Depot consisted of a black granite base, Indiana limestone, and curved glass, finished with a stainless steel-trimmed, porcelain enamel marquee. According to Karen L. Brandt, the exterior design was intended to \\"evoke a feeling of movement and speed\\". The building itself was steel framed and rectangular in shape, measuring by . The Bus Depot's rear and side walls were built with buff brick, and a porte-coch√®re served as a bus lane on the building's east side. The original interior of the Ann Arbor Bus Depot featured birchwood cabinetry and stainless steel stairways designed to complement the sleek appearance of the exterior. As originally built, the Bus Depot's interior included a baggage room, a ticket counter, a waiting area that could accommodate 62 people, and a lunch counter that sat 14 diners. Restrooms were located on the mezzanine level. By 2005, however, the building's interior had been extensively modified, and the only original features that had survived were the ceramic tiled walls in the restrooms and banded steel rails on the stairs. The original beige and brown terrazzo floors had been covered over with beige vinyl tile. In 2005, Brandt described the Bus Depot as being \\"in dire need of cleaning, repair and restoration\\", noting examples of chipped enamel, roof corrosion, rusted window frames, cracked windowpanes, and cracked mortar in masonry throughout the building.  Awards and accolades  In 1986, the Ann Arbor Observer named the Bus Depot one of its \\"favorite buildings\\". It was added to the Ann Arbor Register of Historic Places in 1988 as an Individual Historic Property. In 2001, it lost this designation due to a Michigan Supreme Court decision that ruled that a city's historic district could only consist of contiguous properties, which resulted in numerous buildings losing their historic status.  Redevelopment and demolition  First Martin Corporation purchased the Ann Arbor Bus Depot property in 1989. Its March 1998 proposal to tear down the bus station and build a ten-story office building on the site was approved by the Ann Arbor Historic District Commission in January 1999, but in 2005 the station was still standing and the office building had not been built. In 2013, First Martin's restoration of the Bus Depot's blue neon and steel marquee won a Special Merit Award from the Historic District Commission, which is given to recognize \\"exceptional projects, landscapes or other unique preservation projects\\". In December 2013, First Martin proposed the construction of a six-story hotel on the Ann Arbor Bus Depot property, and at the same time voiced its intention to preserve the Depot's marquee and facade and ultimately incorporate them into the proposed hotel. In June 2014, the Ann Arbor City Council voted unanimously to approve First Martin's proposed hotel, which at that point was revealed to be a 110-room, extended- stay Residence Inn by Marriott. The plan included the destruction of the Bus Depot, and a subsequent move for Greyhound services to a repurposed Republic Parking office inside a parking garage on the corner of Fourth and William. Both the Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council, represented by chair Ray Detter, and the majority of the Historic District Commissioners voiced their support for the project and its commitment to preserve the Bus Depot's facade and marquee. Rebecca Binno, the Preservation Committee Chair of the Detroit Area Art Deco Society, testified in opposition to the plan to preserve only the building's facade and demolish the rest of the structure. After the Ann Arbor Historic District Commission gave its approval to the First Martin plan, Binno lamented the decision as \\"another case of our moderne architecture being considered expendable and not appreciated as significant to the community‚Äôs history.\\" On June 20, 2014, the Ann Arbor Bus Depot's marquee was removed in preparation for the demolition of the building and subsequent construction of the hotel. The hotel, scheduled to open on September 1, 2015, has been described by city planner Alexis DiLeo as being a blend of the Bus Depot's art moderne design and \\"classic downtown Ann Arbor\\". On July 9, 2014, Greyhound left the Bus Depot and transferred its services to 115 E. William, approximately half a mile away and just across the street from the Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority's Blake Transit Center. The bus station was then demolished on July 21, 2014.  Legacy  The Ann Arbor Bus Depot was both the last surviving example of Streamline Moderne architecture and the last public Art Deco structure in Ann Arbor. It was a popular photographic subject in the city, and it was also featured in numerous Ann Arbor-related promotional materials and guide books.

It is one of the largest college athletic facilities in the country. RIMAC Arena is the home arena of the UC San Diego Tritons men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams, and Triton Soccer Stadium on the adjacent RIMAC Field hosts Triton men's and women's soccer matches.  History  In 1990, UC San Diego proposed a fee increase of $70 per student to fund a new athletic and event complex. Advocates of the project argued that the existing Main Gym did not have enough aerobic or weight-lifting space to support a rapidly growing university. In addition, Main Gym only seated 2,200 and was rarely available for concerts. The referendum narrowly passed with 51% of the votes, but the results were contested for years. In September 1991, the Regents of the University of California approved a $33.5 million design by Parkin Architects for the proposed complex, which was architecturally similar to the existing Price Center. Construction began in December 1992, and the facility was completed in December 1994. Upon its completion, RIMAC was the largest NCAA Division III athletic complex in the country and remains one of the largest among all universities. The complex was inaugurated by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech dedicating the newly-named Eleanor Roosevelt College. Since 2011, the facilities has been run by the Senior Public Events Manager, Marc Beasley. In 2015, RIMAC was LEED-silver certified by the U.S. Green Building Council.  Arena building  A side entrance of RIMAC Arena The interior of RIMAC Arena RIMAC Arena is the name used to refer to the 186,000 square foot building that houses both the home arena of the Tritons and the adjacent auxiliary gym. The 44,000 square foot arena itself stands 52 feet tall (45 feet from floor to rafters) and contains six dressing rooms and a 60-by-40-foot-stage, among other facilities. It seats 4,200 spectators in the bleachers for Triton basketball and volleyball home games, expandable to 5,000 through the use of floor seats for concerts. Curtains can divide the facility into five basketball courts that use Robbins Bio-Cushion I flooring. The floor space can also be used for conventions, concerts, trade shows, and other events. In the past, it has hosted training camps for the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers, and Sacramento Kings. Since 2011, concerts have been exclusively booked by Nederlander Concerts. The auxiliary gym accommodates two additional basketball or volleyball courts, as well as three mirrored activity rooms, two squash courts, eight racquetball courts, a wellness center, a pro shop, two conference rooms, and two locker rooms. It also contains a 12,000 square foot weight and fitness room, which was the highest priority for students upon construction. This supplements the original UCSD Main Gym weight room, as well as the subsequently constructed Spanos Training Facility and Canyonview Aquatic Center. A 3,000 square foot pit can be reserved for athletic teams.  Field  RIMAC Field is an 11.8-acre Santa Ana Grass field located immediately northeast of RIMAC Arena. The field is used for NCAA, club, and intramural athletic events, as well as the UC San Diego convocation and commencement ceremonies. It can be divided into five regulation soccer fields or adapted for concerts and music festivals. Previously, it was used by the San Diego Chargers as their training camp facility. UC San Diego's annual Sun God Festival is held on RIMAC Field. The festival, which features two concert stages and various attractions, typically approaches the field's maximum attendance of 20,000. Like those at RIMAC Arena, outside concerts on RIMAC Field have been exclusively booked by Nederlander Concerts since 2011. = Triton Soccer Stadium = For NCAA soccer games, a western section of RIMAC Field is cordoned off by temporary fences to create a regulation-sized soccer pitch. Permanent stone bleachers on the west side of the stadium allow a maximum capacity of 750, which can be expanded to 1,750 through the use of temporary bleachers for NCAA postseason fixtures. A commentary and scoring table is usually erected opposite the bleachers between the two teams' benches. The UC San Diego men's and women's soccer teams play their home games here. = Triton Softball Field = The Triton Softball Field on RIMAC Field The regulation-sized UC San Diego softball field is located just south of Triton Soccer Stadium. It is usually separated from the rest of RIMAC Field by a fence that measures 220 feet from home plate. In 2008, the school spent $8.6 million to expand the bleachers, improve the dugouts and field, and add a press box.  RIMAC Annex  RIMAC Annex with the arena in the background RIMAC was originally planned to include more conference-room space, dining facilities, additional hot tubs, saunas, a rock-climbing center, and an outdoor resource center. Budget controversies forced the university to postpone many of these plans. In 2005, discussion reopened regarding the expansion of RIMAC's facilities to keep up with growing student demand, but these plans were again postponed. Finally, in 2008, construction began on RIMAC Annex, a 10,000-square-foot building located adjacent to RIMAC Arena. The $10 million building was completed September 2009. RIMAC Annex opened with several meeting spaces and study lounges, a convenience store, and a Peet's Coffee and Tea. A sports bar opened shortly afterwards.

He has earned four degrees from the University of Michigan, and served on the boards of directors of various Ann Arbor non-profit organizations before being elected to public office. In 2008, Taylor was elected to Ann Arbor City Council as a Democrat, on which he served a total of three terms before announcing his mayoral campaign in 2013. After winning a highly contested Democratic primary in August 2014, he was elected Mayor of Ann Arbor on November 4, 2014, winning 84.21% of the vote as he easily defeated independent candidate Bryan Kelly. Taylor's philosophy generally resembles that of his predecessor, John Hieftje, including his emphases on development, infrastructure, and the relationship between the city and the University of Michigan. Early life Taylor was born in 1967 in New York City, and moved to Illinois with his family in 1976. During his junior and senior years of high school, he attended the Interlochen Arts Academy, near Traverse City, Michigan. In 1985, he enrolled at the University of Michigan, from which he has earned four degrees: a B.A. in English, a B.M.A. in Vocal Performance, an M.A. in American History, and a J.D. He was president of the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan, a housing cooperative counting 550 members, and served as editor-in- chief of the Michigan Law Review while attending the University of Michigan Law School. Taylor is a corporate and commercial attorney, and he practices with the law firm Hooper Hathaway in Ann Arbor. Prior to joining Hooper Hathaway, he worked with Butzel Long, also in Ann Arbor, and Ropes & Gray in Boston; he was additionally a law clerk for Bruce Selya, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Prior to being elected to public office, Taylor served on the boards of directors of the Ann Arbor non- profit organizations 826michigan, Ann Arbor in Concert, and FestiFools. Political career Ann Arbor City Council = In 2008, Taylor ran for Ann Arbor City Council as a Democrat on a platform that included restraining spending, balancing development with the city's character, investing in infrastructure, protecting the city's parks and recreation offerings, and supporting its neediest residents. In the election, he defeated fellow Democrat Stephen Kunselman by a two-to-one margin for a seat on the council. He would not be challenged in an election again until he ran for mayor in 2014. Taylor served a total of three terms on Ann Arbor City Council, where he represented the city's Third Ward. In 2010, he announced that he would seek re-election due in part to the effects of the Great Recession on the city. During his tenure, Taylor participated in the City Council's Budget Committee, City Administrator Search Committee, Council Rules Committee, Parks Advisory Commission, Senior Center and Mack Pool Task Force, and Taxicab Board. As a Council member, Taylor gained a reputation for supporting Ann Arbor's local crosswalk law, advocating for more commercial and residential recycling, maintaining zoning boundaries and downtown building height limits, opposing digital billboards, and subsidizing public art; in December 2013, he co- sponsored a proposal to contribute $10,000 to help fund the 2014 Ann Arbor Street Art Fair. = Mayoral campaign = Taylor officially announced his campaign for mayor on December 20, 2013, when he submitted the 250 signatures (50 each from Ann Arbor's five wards) required to run for the office. At the time, MLive reporter Ryan Stanton described him as one of then-mayor John Hieftje's \\"closest political allies\\"; for his part, Hieftje called Taylor \\"incredibly competent and highly qualified\\" and opined that he would \\"make a fine mayor\\". In August 2014, Taylor took 47.57% of the vote and the party nomination in the Democratic primary, edging fellow Council members Stephen Kunselman, Sabra Briere, and Sally Hart Petersen in a highly contested race. During his campaign, Taylor spent more money than any of his competitors: a total of $75,698. = Mayor of Ann Arbor = On November 4, 2014, Taylor was elected Mayor of Ann Arbor, winning 84.21% of the vote as he easily defeated independent candidate Bryan Kelly. Andrew Cluley of WEMU described the result as one that would not bring any major changes to Ann Arbor's municipal government, opining that while \\"a few names may be changing...most of the policies are expected to remain the same\\". Taylor was sworn in on November 10, 2014 at the city clerk's office. In a December 2014 interview, he outlined some of the most pressing issues facing the city and his administration: among them, the need for greater residential density downtown, making the city more affordable for the working class, better supporting the arts, and determining the future direction and development of Liberty Plaza, a downtown park. Ann Arbor Observer writer James Leonard described the similarities between Taylor and his predecessor, Hieftje, as \\"striking\\"; Michigan Daily reporter Emma Kerr noted that Taylor's philosophy echoed Hieftje's on several key issues, including development, infrastructure, and the relationship between the city and the University of Michigan. More specifically, Taylor expressed his intentions to individually evaluate construction projects and amend then- current zoning regulations, maintain and repair local roads (although he acknowledged that much of this work was being done at the county level), and meet with University president Mark Schlissel. Both Taylor and Hieftje consider transportation to be among the most important and impactful of the city government's responsibilities, including its local bus service and a proposal for commuter rail. Leonard also noted what he perceived to be key differences between the two mayors, describing Hieftje as \\"at heart a salesman who truly loves his product\\" and Taylor as \\"at heart an attorney who persuades through reasoned discussion\\"; he added that Taylor's \\"cooler approach could accomplish as much while alienating fewer people\\". Personal life Taylor is married to Ann Arbor native Eva Rosenwald, and the couple have two children. Outside of his political and professional careers, Taylor has also performed with a large number of community theaters and local choirs.

In crystallography, a stacking fault is a type of defect which characterizes the disordering of crystallographic planes. It is thus considered a planar defect.Fine, Morris E. (1921). \\"Introduction to Chemical and Structural Defects in Crystalline Solids\\", in Treatise on Solid State Chemistry Volume 1, Springer. The most common example of stacking faults is found in close-packed crystal structures. Face-centered cubic (fcc) structures differ from hexagonal close packed (hcp) structures only in stacking order: both structures have close-packed atomic planes with sixfold symmetry ‚Äî the atoms form equilateral triangles. When stacking one of these layers on top of another, the atoms are not directly on top of one another. The first two layers are identical for hcp and fcc, and labelled AB. If the third layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above those of the first layer, the stacking will be ABA ‚Äî this is the hcp structure, and it continues ABABABAB. However, there is another possible location for the third layer, such that its atoms are not above the first layer. Instead, it is the atoms in the fourth layer that are directly above the first layer. This produces the stacking ABCABCABC, which is actually along the [111] direction of a cubic crystal structure. In this context, a stacking fault is a local deviation from one of the close-packed stacking sequences to the other one. Usually, only one- two- or three-layer interruptions in the stacking sequence are referred to as stacking faults. An example for the fcc structure is the sequence ABCABABCAB. Stacking faults carry a given formation enthalpy per unit area; this is called stacking-fault energy.  Formation of stacking faults in FCC crystal  Stacking faults are two dimensional planar defects that can occur in crystalline materials. They can be formed during crystal growth, during plastic deformation as partial dislocations move as a result of dissociation of a perfect dislocation, or by condensation of point defects during high-rate plastic deformation.Li, B.; Yan, P. F.; Sui, M. L.; Ma, E. Transmission Electron Microscopy Study of Stacking Faults and Their Interaction with Pyramidal Dislocations in Deformed Mg. Acta Materialia 2010, 58 (1), 173‚Äì179. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2009.08.066. The start and finish of a stacking fault are marked by partial line dislocations such as a partial edge dislocation. Line dislocations tend to occur on the closest packed plane in the closest packed direction. For an FCC crystal, the closest packed plane is the (111) plane, which becomes the glide plane, and the closest packed direction is the [110] direction. Therefore, a perfect line dislocation in FCC has the burgers vector ¬Ω<110>, which is a translational vector.Hull, D.; Bacon, D. Chapter 5. Dislocations in Face-Centered Cubic Metals. In Introduction to Dislocations; 2011; pp 85‚Äì107. Splitting into two partial dislocations is favorable because the energy of a line defect is proportional to the square of the burger‚Äôs vector magnitude. For example, an edge dislocation may split into two Shockley partial dislocations with burger‚Äôs vector of 1/6<112>. This direction is no longer in the closest packed direction, and because the two burger‚Äôs vectors are at 60 degrees with respect to each other in order to complete a perfect dislocation, the two partial dislocations repel each other. This repulsion is a consequence of stress fields around each partial dislocation affecting the other. The force of repulsion depends on factors such as shear modulus, burger‚Äôs vector, Poisson‚Äôs ratio, and distance between the dislocations. As the partial dislocations repel, stacking fault is created in between. By nature of stacking fault being a defect, it has higher energy than that of a perfect crystal, so acts to attract the partial dislocations together again. When this attractive force balance the repulsive force described above, the defects are in equilibrium state. Stacking faults may also be created by Frank partial dislocations with burger‚Äôs vector of 1/3<111>. There are two types of stacking faults caused by Frank partial dislocations: intrinsic and extrinsic. An intrinsic stacking fault forms by vacancy agglomeration and there is a missing plane with sequence ABCA_BA_BCA, where BA is the stacking fault.5.4.1 Partial Dislocations and Stacking Faults http://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/MatSE584/kap_5/backbone/r5_4_1.html. An extrinsic stacking fault is formed from interstitial agglomeration, where there is an extra plane with sequence ABCA_BAC_ABCA.  Visualizing Stacking Faults using Electron Microscopy  Stacking faults can be visualized using electron microscopy. One commonly used technique is transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The other is electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) in scanning electron microscope (SEM). In an SEM, near-surface defects can be identified because backscattered electron yield differs in defect regions where the crystal is strained, and this gives rise to different contrasts in the image. In order to identify the stacking fault, it is important to recognize the exact Bragg condition for certain lattice planes in the matrix such that regions without defects will detect little backscattered electrons and thus appear dark. Meanwhile, regions with the stacking fault will not satisfy the Bragg condition and thus yield high amounts of backscattered electrons, and thus appear bright in the image. Inverting the contrast gives images where the stacking fault appears dark in the midst of a bright matrix.Weidner, A.; Glage, A.; Sperling, L.; Biermann, H. Observation of Stacking Faults in a Scanning Electron Microscope by Electron Channelling Contrast Imaging. IJMR 2011, 102 (1), 3‚Äì5. https://doi.org/10.3139/146.110448. In a TEM, bright field imaging is one technique used to identify the location of stacking faults. Typical image of stacking fault is dark with bright fringes near a low-angle grain boundary, sandwiched by dislocations at the end of the stacking fault. Fringes indicate that the stacking fault is at an incline with respect to the viewing plane.  Stacking faults in semiconductors  Many compound semiconductors, e.g. those combining elements from groups III and V or from groups II and VI of the periodic table, crystallize in the fcc zincblende or hcp wurtzite crystal structures. In a semiconductor crystal, the fcc and hcp phases of a given material will usually have different band gap energies. As a consequence, when the crystal phase of a stacking fault has a lower band gap than the surrounding phase, it forms a quantum well, which in photoluminescence experiments leads to light emission at lower energies (longer wavelengths) than for the bulk crystal. In the opposite case (higher band gap in the stacking fault), it constitutes an energy barrier in the band structure of the crystal that can affect the current transport in semiconductor devices.

Thus far in her career, she is known for exploring the relationship between painting and sculpture through deconstruction and materialization of traditional painting materials and tools. Molzan is an adjunct Professor of Visual Art at the UCLA School of Arts and Architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles. Molzan's paintings are often considered as more of a three-dimensional object than a two dimensional surfaces on the wall. Referred to as carrying a sculptural quality, Molzan's paintings are grounded within the practice of painting through the materials she uses, such as oil paints, canvas, linen, and canvas frame. Molzan‚Äôs pieces consist of a process of deconstruction of the traditional elements of painting, which are then recombined into a new composition. She creates a juxtaposition between the mediums of sculpture and painting through the alteration of the physical state of the canvas. Molzan‚Äôs work is associated with the techniques of impressionism, abstract expressionism, and minimalism. Biography Dianna Molzan was born in 1972 in Tacoma, Washington. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2001 and also attended the Universit√§t der K√ºnste in Berlin. She received her Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Southern California, writing her senior thesis, How the Frame was One, on the development both theoretical and symbolic framing devices within art, primarily focusing on two works: Georges Seurat's La Grande Jatte (1884) and Eva Hesse's Hang Up (1966). Her first solo exhibition was at Overduin and Kite, Los Angeles, in 2009. Molzan's solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art titled \\"Bologna Meissen\\" in 2011 was her first solo museum exhibition and debut in New York. According to the Whitney Museum, Molzan \\"uses a variety of material approaches that differ from one work to the next, each painting exhibits a subtle precision in its intention and execution. Although she works with traditional materials, such as oil on linen, she approaches her canvases irreverently, invoking elements of fashion, the decorative arts, ceramics, and popular design.\\"https://whitney.org/Exhibitions/DiannaMolzan Molzan chose the title for \\"Bologna Meissen\\" because of \\"two cities that are the origins of two of [Molzan's] biggest influences‚ÄîBologna, Italy, for the painter Giorgio Morandi and Meissen, Germany, for Meissen porcelain ware.\\" https://api.whitney.org/uploads/generic_file/file/192/molzan_brochure.pdf In conversation with curator Margot Norton of the Whitney Museum, Molzan states, \\" I limit myself to traditional painting materials because I want to show that it isn‚Äôt the materials that have changed over the centuries, but the thinking about the materials and the philosophy behind their application. Oil paint and linen and the wooden support are all inherited materials that date back to the Renaissance and continue through modernism and all the other styles of painting that are radically different from one another but use the same stuff. I love that I can paint-splatter a canvas and make it look like hard plastic by using more or less the same materials Rousseau used to depict the forest of Fontainebleau in the nineteenth century.\\" https://api.whitney.org/uploads/generic_file/file/192/molzan_brochure.pdf ExhibitionsSolo exhibitions= * 2013: La Jennifer, Overduin and Kite, Los Angeles * 2012: Grand Tourist, ICA Boston, Boston * 2011: Bologna Meissen, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York * 2009: The Case of the Strand, Overduin and Kite, Los Angeles * 2009: A Diamond in the Square, USC Roski Gallery, Los Angeles =Group exhibitions= * 2015: Speed Space, Tif Sigfrids, Los Angeles, curated by Alexandra Gaty * 2015: Matters of Pattern, Skarskedt, New York * 2014: Forever Now: Painting in the New Millennium, MoMA, New York, curated by Laura Hoptman with Margaret Ewing * 2014: Animal Mineral Vegetable, Andrew Kreps Gallery, New York * 2014: Another Cat‚Äôs Show, 356 Mission, Los Angeles * 2014: The White Album, Richard Telles, Los Angeles * 2013: Xstraction, The Hole, New York * 2013: Expanding the Field of Painting, ICA Boston, Boston * 2013: Painter Painter, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis * 2012: The Piano Lesson, Vilma Gold, London * 2012: Paintings from the Rubell Family Collection, Fundaci√≥n Banco Santander, Madrid * 2012: Il Regalo, Overduin and Kite, Los Angeles * 2011: The Rose-Colored Room, Overduin and Kite, Los Angeles * 2011: Progression Minus Progress, Romer Young Gallery, San Francisco * 2011: All of this and nothing, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles * 2010: How Soon Now, Rubell Family Collection, Miami * 2009: Rogue Wave ‚Äô09: 10 Artists from Los Angeles, LA Louver, Venice * 2009: CAA Los Angeles MFA Exhibition, USC Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery, Los Angeles * 2008: Some Paintings, LA Weekly Annual Biennial, Track 16 Gallery, Los Angeles References Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American painters Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Category:University of Southern California alumni ","title":"Dianna Molzan"},{"id":"45630857","text":"Voliba gigantea is a moth in the family Crambidae.

The album is a notable shift in musical direction for the band as they moved away from garage rock, and began experimenting more with psychedelic rock. Upon its release in 1967, the album reached the Top 100 on the Billboard 200, but their single, \\"A Thousand Shadows\\", was less successful than The Seeds' previous hits. Background The Seeds moved into 1967 as an established band with national hits, including \\"Pushin' Too Hard\\", and two albums solidifying their individual sound. With their new manager, Lord Tim Hudson, and a knack for outlandish live performances, the band's public profile was at an all-time high. The band went into recording sessions hoping to capitalize on their past success, and create a more sophisticated sound. Recording sessions began in Gold Star Studios as early as November 3, 1966, but the majority of studio work was completed in 1967. The first recorded track, \\"Travel With Your Mind\\", was the only one complete in 1966, and was a contrast to the future developments. The project was complete on June 6, 1967 with the final track being \\"March of the Flower Children\\". The Seeds, mostly under the direction of Sky Saxon utilized orchestrations, and classical instruments in a psychedelic format. Compared to past material, the band established a complexity in their instrumentals as there were more overdubbing involved in the process. Each individual song took an obviously increased amount of takes to find cohesion with the overdubbing. Saxon had embraced the psychedelic scene in the band's own take on the genre, and infused it with their own sound. New instruments more prominent in Future recordings including the piano, trumpet, and percussion. Release Future was released in August 1967 on the GNP label, and reached moderate chart success when it peaked at number 87 on the Billboard 200. The band's lead single, \\"A Thousand Shadows\\", fared better than the group's last single, \\"Mr. Farmer\\", but still only reached number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100. Future was the last Seeds album to chart nationally, and, despite its success, has been unfavored by some. Critics directed their disappointment at the album's similarities to The Beatles' work, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, even though The Seeds began recording before that album could potentially influence their work. In 2013, Future was re-released on the Big Beats label featuring outtakes, alternate versions, and extensive liner notes by Alec Palao.

The landmark has been featured in countless television and film productions. History In 1956, the site began as a gas station, real-estate office, and restaurant called Panorama Pacific at Solimar on property owned by Eastman N. \\"Jake\\" Jacobs near the Pacific Coast Highway on the Ventura-Los Angeles county line. The locals soon began calling the restaurant - which served burgers, sandwiches and fried seafood classics - simply Jake's Diner. Jacobs was an aerodynamicist and engineer who contributed major advances in aeronautics, including the design and applications of advanced airfoils and wind tunnels, and initial studies of then-futuristic concepts such as jet propulsion and nuclear fusion. In the 60's, Jacobs leased the restaurant to a Venice family, who took a shot in the \\"restaurant\\" business. There were John and Jean Leech, their three children, Myrna, Richard and Becky, Grandparents, Ollie and Kathryn. The whole family worked there from 6:00am until 9:30pm. All the surfers loved John for allowing them to work for a cup of coffee and breakfast. The hardworking family decided to move back to L.A. when rumor surfaced of a proposed eminent domain forcing a road right through the property east to the 101. In 1974, Jacobs sold the place to Paul Seay and his wife Dolly, and the couple changed the name to Neptune's Net. Chong Lee and his wife Michelle purchased the restaurant from the Seays on July 4, 1991, and are the current owners. In film and television *Losin' It (1983) - Woody (Tom Cruise), Dave (Jackie Earle Haley), Spider (John Stockwell), and Wendell (John P. Navin Jr.) engaged in an epic food fight at Neptune's Net.

But a decided mechanical instinct, evinced in the construction, while a schoolboy, of a small working engine and other appliances, induced a reluctance to the law, and a strong desire to try his fortunes in the shop.

Since the mid-1980s Cuomo has often collaborated on books and exhibitions with the Magnum Photos agency and Aperture. Cuomo is the recipient of numerous awards, including the International Center of Photography‚Äôs Infinity Award in 1991, 1995, and 2004, and the National Magazine Award, in 2004, from the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) for her art direction of Aperture.  Early life  Cuomo was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and was raised in West New York, New Jersey, by John Cuomo and Rosa DeGennaro, both Italian immigrants. DeGennaro took Cuomo to Saturday morning art classes when she was in the third grade. She attended Saint Joseph of the Palisades High School. Cuomo began college at Montclair State University, where she studied fine art, before transferring to Cooper Union. At Cooper Union, Cuomo focused her fine art practice by working with the filmmaker Robert Breer and her practice in conceptual art with sculptor Hans Haacke.  Early career  After graduating from Cooper Union, Cuomo began working as an Assistant Designer at Mademoiselle magazine in 1980. Mademoiselle‚Äôs Art Director, Paula Greif, introduced Cuomo to Marvin Israel, who took an interest in the young designer. In their first work together, Israel and Cuomo designed a poster celebrating the visionary work of Alexey Brodovitch for a retrospective exhibition in Paris at the Grand Palais. Israel hired Cuomo as the Art Director of the Movies magazine where she began working with many of the photographers who would later shape her career. Through Israel, Cuomo had her first opportunities to work with Richard Avedon, Gilles Peress, Deborah Turbeville, Sylvia Plachy, Hiro, and Neil Selkirk, among others. In 1983, while working at the Movies, Cuomo was asked by Laurie Simmons to design a book of her photographs from the series In and Around the House. In the early 1980s, Cuomo was the Associate Art Director at Vanity Fair, working closely with Alexander Liberman. At the same time, Avedon soon hired Cuomo to art-direct advertising campaigns for Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, and Calvin Klein. Later, Cuomo would collaborate with Avedon, Israel, and the dancer-choreographer Twyla Tharp, on a poster for Twyla Tharp Dance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Cuomo‚Äôs mentor, Marvin Israel, died in May 1984 while working on Richard Avedon‚Äôs exhibition of In the American West in Dallas. In 1985 the Village Voice hired Cuomo as the Art Director for VUE (called View for the first issue), their new fashion magazine. During VUE‚Äôs short life of six issues, Cuomo hired photographers, including Nan Goldin, Larry Fink, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Gilles Peress, Richard Corman, Amy Arbus, Michael Spano, Lynn Davis, Ellen Carey, Jeremiah Dine, William Wegman, and Sylvia Plachy, to photograph fashion spreads. While on assignment for VUE, photographers were given total creative freedom. For one assignment, Nan Goldin photographed a pregnant female body builder at a Russian bath in New York City‚Äôs East Village. The image was eventually included in Goldin‚Äôs book The Ballad of Sexual Dependency. VUE‚Äôs unconventional approach to fashion content was polarizing, which earned praise but also scorn. Radio personality Howard Stern called VUE ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù after seeing Goldin‚Äôs photographs. David Schneiderman, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Voice, said, ‚ÄúAn executive from one major store, whose goods grace another model in the spread, found the ladies in lace ‚Äòshocking‚Äô‚Ä¶ I knew the magazine would be controversial, but we‚Äôve built a profitable business here in the last thirty years being controversial.‚Äù In fall 1986, the Village Voice dissolved VUE.  Career and artistic practice  Toward the end of 1986 Cuomo founded her own studio, Yolanda Cuomo Design, on Lafayette Street. During this time, Cuomo continued working with Richard Avedon as art director for a Revlon ad campaign. The new studio‚Äôs first commercial project was a collaboration with Laurie Simmons. Together they produced Waterballet/Family Collision, bound with a lenticular 3D cover. The book was designed to be ‚Äúspit-proof‚Äù because Simmons‚Äôs daughter, Lena Dunham, had just been born. The studio‚Äôs next project involved the design of a slipcase for a book of Andy Warhol‚Äôs cat drawings. Geraldine Stutz, who had helped launch Warhol‚Äôs career while Vice President at I. Miller Shoes, asked Cuomo to design a book of pre-Pop Warhol drawings and ephemera. Pre Pop Warhol was published by Stutz‚Äôs imprint at Random House, Panache Press, winning the Art Directors Club‚Äôs 68th annual award for best book of the year. In 1987 Cuomo was hired as the creative consultant for Parents (1989), a black comedy horror film set in the 1950s suburban America, directed by Bob Balaban and written by Christopher Hawthorne. Cuomo researched and designed the sets and titles, hiring Philip-Lorca diCorcia to photograph the sets. The film opened to mediocre reviews and poor box office attendance, however, reviewers took note of the production‚Äôs attention to detail. In the New York Times, Caryn James remarked on the film‚Äôs ‚Äúauthentically garish costumes and sets.‚Äù Around the same time, Cuomo began collaborating with the photographer Sylvia Plachy on the design for what would become Sylvia Plachy‚Äôs Unguided Tour. Published in 1990, the book includes photographs from Plachy‚Äôs assignments and travels as well as a vinyl record soundtrack by Tom Waits. It won the International Center of Photography‚Äôs Infinity Award for best publication in 1991. In 1988 Cuomo began sharing a studio building on West 19th Street with the photographer and master printer Neil Selkirk. Selkirk and Cuomo met through Marvin Israel while Cuomo was at the Movies. Selkirk and Cuomo would collaborate for the next twenty-five years on many projects and productions, including the books Infra-Apparel (1993), 1000 on 42nd Street (2000), See No Evil (2006), and Lobbyists (2007); the film Who Is Marvin Israel (2005) and ongoing collaborations with the estate of Diane Arbus. Selkirk is the only person ever authorized to make posthumous prints of the work of Diane Arbus. In the late 1980s Paul Simon called Avedon because he needed someone who knew about photographs. Avedon introduced Simon to Cuomo, who began working with him on the art direction and design of his album, The Rhythm of the Saints (1990). After searching the archives of Magnum Photos, Cuomo designed the packaging, using photographs by Miguel Rio Branco for the front cover and Ren√© Burri for the back cover. Upon its release, The Rhythm of the Saints was an enormous commercial success, selling more than two million copies and going double platinum in the United States, platinum in the United Kingdom and Canada, and earning two Grammy nominations. Cuomo‚Äôs work with Paul Simon led to collaborations with Laurie Anderson on the albums Bright Red (1994) and The Ugly One with the Jewels (1995) as well as producing promotional materials for the Songs and Stories from Moby Dick performances. Anderson was the first person to suggest that Cuomo begin designing with computers. Anderson sat Cuomo down in front of windows with a view of the Hudson River and played music while Cuomo looked through her image archives. Anderson‚Äôs music served as the catalyst for Cuomo‚Äôs designs. In the early 1990s, Cuomo again collaborated with Twyla Tharp, this time designing Push Comes to Shove: An Autobiography (1992). Titled after Tharp‚Äôs 1976 dance work of the same name, Push Comes to Shove features many photographs by Richard Avedon, Martha Swope, James Klosty, and Lois Greenfield, among others, in addition to numerous posters designed by Israel and Cuomo. = Work with Aperture Foundation = In 1992 Melissa Harris became the principal editor of Aperture magazine, ushering in more than two decades of collaboration on the magazine, as well as books and exhibitions. Harris and Cuomo had first worked together on Jean Pigozzi‚Äôs A Short Visit to Planet Earth (1991), a book of photographs that Mick Jagger wrote, ‚Äúshows us an inside view of the world of flesh, food, celebrities, and dogs that most paparazzi can only dream about. . . He has recorded moments of my life that I was barely aware were happening, usually with great humor.‚Äù Harris and Cuomo collaboratively produced numerous monographs, including Sylvia Plachy‚Äôs Goings On About Town and Self Portrait with Cows Going Home; Nick Nichols‚Äôs Earth to Sky; Donna Ferrato‚Äôs Love and Lust; Dona Ann McAdams‚Äôs Caught in the Act; Dario Fo‚Äôs Artful Laughter; Luca Babini‚Äôs Francesco Clemente: A Portrait; Luigi Ghirri‚Äôs It‚Äôs Beautiful Here, Isn‚Äôt It . . .; and Letizia Battaglia‚Äôs Photographs of Sicily. In 2008, Harris and Cuomo collaborated on Josef Koudelka‚Äôs exhibition ‚ÄúInvasion 68 Prague‚Äù which opened at Aperture Gallery to mark the fortieth anniversary of the invasion that ended the Prague Spring. The exhibition featured more than seventy large black and white photographic prints, as well as posters from that era. In August 1968, Koudelka waded into the streets documenting Prague‚Äôs turmoil as Soviet tanks overran the city. Koudelka‚Äôs negatives were smuggled out of the country, eventually distributed by Magnum Photos under the pseudonym ‚Äúunknown Czech photographer‚Äù for the next sixteen years. Koudelka personally selected the images for the exhibition from his archive. The show later traveled to Washington, D.C.; Mexico City, Mexico; Hamilton, NY; Miami, FL; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Tokyo, Japan; Moscow, Russia; Charlottesville, VA; and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In addition to these book and exhibition projects, Cuomo art-directed more than thirty issues of Aperture magazine between 1992 and 2002. = Diane Arbus: Untitled, Revelations, The Libraries, A Chronology = In the early 1990s Cuomo began what has thus far been a two-decade-long collaboration with Doon Arbus on books and exhibitions of the photographs of Diane Arbus. Cuomo and Doon Arbus, Diane Arbus‚Äôs elder daughter, assembled Untitled (1995), the third volume of Arbus‚Äôs work and the only one devoted to a single project, from contact sheets of previously unpublished photographs taken at residences for the mentally retarded between 1969 and 1971. Untitled was not only an expos√© of unknown photographs with a common throughline, but was meant to encourage a more complicated assessment of Arbus‚Äôs work. Starting in 1999 Cuomo and Doon Arbus studied Diane Arbus‚Äôs contact sheets and prints preparing for the first major retrospective since 1972 when the Museum of Modern Art in New York mounted a major posthumous exhibition accompanied by the book Diane Arbus: An Aperture Monograph, designed by Marvin Israel and Doon Arbus. Revelations (2003) was a massive, collaborative effort resulting in a book and exhibition presented by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany; Victoria & Albert Museum, London; Fundaci√≥ la Caixa, Barcelona; and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; between 2003 and 2006. The retrospective included more than two hundred photographs as well as libraries and study centers, which recreated Arbus‚Äôs darkroom, bookshelves, and documents tracing the artist‚Äôs life and trajectory. Revelations, the book, for the first time revealed the scope of Arbus‚Äôs artistic production and her life and work. Revelations includes an essay by Sandra S. Philips, senior curator of photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; ‚ÄúIn the Darkroom,‚Äù a discussion of Arbus‚Äôs printing techniques by Neil Selkirk; a 104-page Chronology by Elisabeth Sussman, guest curator of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art show, and Doon Arbus; and biographical entries on the photographer‚Äôs friends and colleagues by Jeff L. Rosenheim, associate curator of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The success of Revelations inspired the subsequent publication, The Libraries, an accordion-fold book annotating the volumes in Diane Arbus‚Äôs personal library of books, which had been recreated for the Revelations exhibition. Sussman and Doon Arbus‚Äôs text from the Revelations catalogue was subsequently published as a stand-alone volume, Diane Arbus: A Chronology (Aperture, 2011). In the fall of 2011, Cuomo‚Äôs design for Diane Arbus, a show featuring many of the same materials, traveled to four European venues sponsored by the Jeu de Paume in Paris. = New York September 11 by Magnum Photographers = On the morning of September 11, 2001, eleven members of Magnum Photos immediately dispersed from their monthly meeting in New York, documenting the day, as the events unfolded, creating a haunting photographic archive of the attacks. Within weeks, while New Yorkers were still paralyzed by the incomprehensible violence of the loss, photographer Thomas Hoepker approached PowerHouse with the images, and publisher Daniel Powers asked Cuomo to help make a book to benefit victims and their families. The team edited, designed, and produced the book in three weeks; New York September 11 was printed and bound in the United States with paper, ink, and printing donated to support the effort. = Here Is New York: A Democracy of Photographs = Here Is New York (2001) was a crowd-sourced exhibition and book of photographs spontaneously conceived and organized by Alice Rose George, Gilles Peress, Michael Shulman, and Charles Traub, in response to the attacks of September 11. Within two days of the attacks, messages and photographs taped to the window of 116 Prince Street inspired an exhibition, as Michael Shulman notes in the book‚Äôs essay, ‚Äúas broad and inclusive as possible, open to ‚Äòanybody and everybody‚Äô: not just photojournalists and other professional photographers, but bankers, rescue workers, artists and children‚Äîamateurs of every stripe.‚Äù In this spirit, Cuomo and Peress designed the book not ‚Äúto showcase the ‚Äòbest‚Äô or ‚Äòstrongest‚Äô images, but to give the most coherent sense of the whole.‚Äù The proceeds from the sale of Here Is New York were donated to the Children‚Äôs Aid Society to benefit the families of victims of the attacks. = Access to Life = Between 2007 and 2009 Cuomo curated and designed Access to Life (2009), an exhibition and book featuring the work of several Magnum photographers: Jim Goldberg, Eli Reed, Steve McCurry, Larry Towell, Jonas Bendiksen, Paolo Pellegrin, Alex Majoli, and Gilles Peress. Access to Life was a historic collaboration between the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Magnum Photos, ‚Äúto document the transformative effects of treatment with antiretroviral drugs against AIDS on more than thirty individuals and their families in nine countries around the world.‚Äù This combination of art, documentary, and advocacy, resulted in a book published by Aperture and an exhibition that traveled to Rome, New York, Sydney, Tokyo, Oakland, Oslo, Madrid, Paris, and Washington, D.C., to spread awareness and garner support for the Global Fund. Editions of Access to Life were presented to world leaders at the UN summit on AIDS in New York City on October 5, 2010. = Richard Avedon = After Richard Avedon‚Äôs death, Cuomo and Norma Stevens, the executive director of Avedon‚Äôs studio, poured through the breadth of his work. Together, they revisited Avedon‚Äôs negatives, books, magazines, and contact sheets to assemble two rich volumes. Avedon Fashion 1944‚Äì2000 (Abrams, 2009) surveys Avedon‚Äôs distinctly inventive, dynamic photographs of models, designers, stylists, and clothes that filled the pages of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Vogue, Egoiste, and The New Yorker throughout his career. The book accompanied an exhibition of the same name at the International Center of Photography in 2009. Richard Avedon: Performance (Abrams, 2008) brought together, in one volume, more than two hundred photographs of iconic artists and musicians, dancers and divas, Pop stars and performers, actors and comedians, who shaped the culture of the second half of the twentieth century. = New York at Night = In 2012 Cuomo again collaborated with Norma Stevens to edit New York at Night: Photography After Dark, an anthology showcasing New York City‚Äôs nightlife through photographs by James Van Der Zee, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Diane Arbus, Elliott Erwitt, Larry Fink, Robert Frank, Gilles Peress, Weegee, and Ryan McGinley, among others. New York at Night features essays by Adam Gopnik, Vince Aletti, Patricia Marx, and Pete Hamill, and an introduction by Norma Stevens. Diverse photographs present the city that never sleeps through the lenses of great photographers across the decades who habituated venues and locales everywhere, from gin joints to Studio 54, from Harlem to the harbor. As Gopnik writes in his essay, ‚ÄúUrban Nocturne,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew York shines at night very bright, and it shines, kaleidoscopically, in many different pieces.‚Äù = The Library of Julio Santo Domingo = In 2012 Cuomo was commissioned by the family of the late Julio Mario Santo Domingo, Jr. to create a book celebrating Santo Domingo‚Äôs remarkable private collection devoted to ‚Äúaltered states.‚Äù The resulting two- volume opus, The Library of Julio Santo Domingo, written by Peter Watts,http://collections.si.edu/search/record/siris_sil_1033989 includes photographs, posters, paintings, and objects related to drugs, erotica, the occult, revolution, and rock music. Santo Domingo‚Äôs library and archives featured more than one hundred thousand items and covered everything from drafts by Marcel Proust and Sigmund Freud to the Rolling Stones and Lenny Bruce. The bulk of Santo Domingo‚Äôs collection is on long-term loan with Harvard University, where it is being catalogued by the distinguished Houghton Library. It has been described by the Harvard Gazette as ‚Äúuniquely rich even within Harvard‚Äôs enormously diverse collections.‚Äù Santo Domingo‚Äôs rock collection was donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland.  The new studio  In January 2013, Cuomo moved her studio to the Landmark Arts Building in Chelsea. The building is shared by the Aperture Foundation, The Magnum Foundation, Peter Hujar‚Äôs Archive, and numerous galleries.  Teaching  Cuomo has taught courses on graphic design and bookmaking since 1982 when she started at the School of Visual Arts. In the late 1980s, she taught graphic design at the Parsons School of Design. In the late 1990s Cuomo taught at SVA‚Äôs Graduate Photography Program. Cuomo is currently an adjunct professor of design in the Department of Photography and Imaging at New York University‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts since 1996.  Recognition and awards  Cuomo‚Äôs devotion to art and design has been repeatedly recognized. In 2013 she was profiled by the New Yorker in a short film, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Make a Book About This,‚Äù and featured on Time magazine‚Äôs LightBox in ‚ÄúProfile of a Curatorial Master: Yolanda Cuomo.‚Äù Cuomo‚Äôs work has also been honored by several important industry awards. She was the recipient of the prestigious National Magazine Award, in 2004, from the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) for her art direction of Aperture, the premier magazine for significant photography. She received Infinity Awards in the best publication category in 1991 and 2004; and for design in 1995, from the International Center of Photography. Other leading professional organizations have recognized Cuomo‚Äôs work, including the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), Society of Publication Designers (SPD), the Art Directors Club, and Magazine Publishers of America.  Personal life  Yolanda Cuomo is married to Joseph McLaughlin, a professor of Urban Studies at Saint Peter‚Äôs University. Together they have two children, Gianni, born 1992, and Luca, born 1998.

It is found on St Aignan Island in the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. The wingspan is 16‚Äì18 mm. The forewings are orange yellow with a fulvous tinge and some white at the base in and below the cell. There is an erect silvery-white subbasal band and a silvery-white band just before middle, defined on each side by dark brown below the cell, excurved below the costa and above the inner margin and emitting a spur at the discal fold to the white discoidal lunule defined by black except above. The medial part of the costa is white and there is a silvery-white wedge-shaped mark in the discal fold before the postmedial band, which is silvery white defined on each side by dark brown, incurved below the costa, then excurved to vein 3, below which it is angled inwards, then erect with its outer edge excurved at the submedian fold. There is also a silvery-white subterminal band from the costa to vein 1, defined on each side by dark brown, strongly on the outer side, its extremities at the costa and above vein 1 dilated into spots, excurved between those points. The hindwings are orange yellow with a slight fulvous tinge and a white base. There is a silvery white antemedial band from the cell to the inner margin connected with a silvery-white patch in the end of the cell with a black discoidal bar on its outer edge. There is also a silvery-white postmedial band, excurved and defined on the outer side by brown to vein 2, then incurved. The subterminal band is silvery white, defined on each side by black from the costa to vein 1, its extremities on the costa and above vein 1 expanding into spots, excurved between those points.
