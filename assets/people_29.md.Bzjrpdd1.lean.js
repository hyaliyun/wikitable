History  The Committee on Indian Depredations was created by a Senate resolution on March 15, 1893, and superseded a select committee on Indian depredations that had been established in 1889 to deal with the increased volume of Indian depredation claims. The committee oversaw claims under the Indian Depredation Act, which allows for citizen claims against the federal government for crimes committed by American Indians. Many committee petitioners requested that claims for crimes committed during wartime be eligible for compensation, because the act limited claims to depredations committed in times of peace with the Indians. The committee was terminated April 18, 1921, when the Senate eliminated this and several other obsolete standing and select committees. =Predecessor committees= *Select Committee on Indian Depredations (18891893) Chairmen *Gideon C.

The building is currently in ruin, where the dome and a significant portion of the western wing have since collapsed. There is a dodecagonal drum that is centrally positioned over the structure. Two prayer rooms or \\"studies\\" are positioned adjacent to and at either side of the apse. Each room contains a secret passage entrance at the second story level, facing the direction of the apse. The small passage allegedly leads to small rooms above. The apse contains the remnants of numerous portraits of the Apostles painted as frescoes around the semi-dome above.  Kamsarakan S.

Astvatsatsin is situated adjacent to the entrance of the cemetery and monastic complex at Talin and near the main cathedral. It is a small cruciform central- planned building with a Byzantine-style single red tile, octagonal umbrella domed roof that is centered over the church. The dome sits above an octagonal drum that is pierced by four small windows. A decorative geometric projecting cornice trims the dome and gable roof. There is a single entrance to the building from the western façade, with an inscription written upon the half- rounded tympanum above. The inscription attests to a construction date in the 7th century. It reads the following passage: There are two Nersehs that are noted to have ruled as governor; one during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius in 639, and another during that of Byzantine Emperor Justinian II in 689. Its construction has been attributed to Prince Nerseh Kamsarakan who commissioned the church during the 7th century; a time when the Kamsarakan family ruled over the region surrounding Talin.

Bill shock can happen when, for example, a user grossly overuses data applications without an appropriate data plan, or uses a mobile device while roaming (whether domestically or internationally) without understanding the voice or data roaming charges involved.27000 mobile bill shock Bill shock can generically be used as a term for the surprise an individual receives on any bill that has an amount higher than expected pending to be paid. In recent years, with the growth of SaaS, and subscription based services, Bill Shock has become a popular phrase in the software sector. Other examples of bill shock have been noted in credit card bills, rental bills, and utility bills. The use of non- geographic telephone numbers in the United Kingdom has also been a major cause of bill shock. Pollster YouGov found that 49% of mobile users have been surprised to see how much they have been charged for calling non-geographic numbers and 90% believe organisations should make the cost of these calls clearer. According to Ofcom, UK consumers paid around £1.9 billion for calls to non-geographic numbers in 2009. Impact In some cases bill shock can be extreme, usually a result of a mobile bill priced into the tens of thousands of dollars. These cases often make news both locally and nationally due to the sense of compassion the experience provokes, and the suitability the story has for mainstream media. This can result from another company - not the customer's provider - refusing to waive roaming charges. In Europe and the United States, governments are becoming more involved with monitoring issues around bill shock and implementing proper regulations around smart devices that protect consumers. Notably, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in the United States handles nearly all FCC domestic wireless telecommunications programs, policies, and outreach initiatives. A survey in 2010 revealed that over 30 million Americans are impacted by bill shock each year. It can be difficult to prevent bill shock while using a mobile device because monitoring the data, voice and SMS and roaming consumption on a mobile device is difficult. It can also be difficult for phone companies to alert their customers to potential impending bill shock, because various third-party companies impose various roaming charges (a mobile phone company pays other companies for its customer's usage of their networks), so the customer's usage of networks in different areas of the country or the world will result in different charges. Migratory birds can be particularly prone to bill shock; in 2019 a single Russian eagle used up the entire telecoms budget of a research project, when it unexpectedly flew to Iran where it was charged over three times more for each SMS message it sent. Mobility is an important trend in the marketplace as consumers and businesses continue to embrace smart devices. The following mobility trends are noteworthy as they demonstrate the continued dependence on smart devices, and all of these can have billing effects. If consumers use products or services without checking pricing, they may experience bill shock. #Consumerization of IT: Employee-owned devices on the corporate network. Consumerization is driving the adoption of mobility in the workplace. Businesses see mobility as an opportunity to offer employees flexibility. Companies enhance their revenue by using devices that increase productivity. #Device diversity: iOS, Android, Windows, etc. #App explosion: People are communicating beyond email and web. Many apps are getting integrated into workplace operations. #Mobile threat emergence: Android an early favorite #Changes in Wireless Speed: 4G speeds have revolutionized wireless accessibility. Individuals are more inclined to stay connected when the networks are fast and efficient. #Carrier plans are also becoming more customizable and complex, except with certain stable calling plans, such as those often offered by small and regional carriers, and this makes it hard for individuals to completely control their usage and costs. Legal action Since 1 July 2010 bill shock is mitigated in the EU. Eurotariff protected consumers by introducing a cut-off mechanism once the bill reaches €50 per month, unless they choose another cut-off limit.3 disables data roaming to avoid bill shock See also * Oligopoly * User-in-the-loop: Transparent dynamic prices all provided before usage References External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20111108041642/http://reboot.fcc.gov/billshock Category:Mobile phone culture Category:Telecommunications economics ","title":"Bill shock"},{"id":"22802228","text":"Montgomery County courthouse.

General structure of the loline alkaloids produced in grasses infected by fungi of the Epichloë/Neotyphodium complex (epichloae endophytes); R' and R denote variable substituents that can include methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups giving rise to different loline species. A loline alkaloid is a member of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by endophytic fungal symbionts of the genus Epichloë (anamorphic species: Neotyphodium). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition. They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, Adenocarpus species (family Fabaceae) and Argyreia mollis (family Convolvulaceae). Discovery A member of the loline alkaloids was first isolated from the grass Lolium temulentum and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification and analysis of the lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the very intimate association of plant and endophyte and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to endophyte infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some chemically defined growth media, which suggests that the endophyte is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature. Mechanism of action Lolines are insecticidal and deterrent to a broad range of insects, including species in the Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Blattodea, such as the bird cherry- oat aphid (genus Rhopalosiphum), large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), and American cockroach (Periplaneta americana). LC50 values of N-formylloline or N-acetylloline from grass seed extracts are 1-20 μg/ml for aphids and milkweed bugs and impair insect development and fecundity and cause avoidance of loline-containing grass tissues. However, results of feeding tests with grass extracts are occasionally difficult to interpret due to the presence of other endophyte alkaloids in these extracts, and the exact mechanisms of the insecticidal actions of the lolines are unknown. The lolines may be neurotoxic to the insects, and differences in the chemical groups at the C-1-amine result in different levels of insect toxicity; for example, N-formylloline (see Fig. 2), which occurs in higher concentrations in endophyte-infected grass plants, has greater insect toxicity than some other lolines, which occur at lower concentrations in the grass plant. Figure 2. N-formylloline, one of the most abundant lolines in endophyte-infected grasses. Loline bioactivities show some unexpected variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, N. coenophialum, has been associated with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. At low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear. Many epichloae endophytes—including N. coenophialum symbiotic with Lolium arundinaceum (syn. Festuca arundinacea, tall fescue)—also produce ergot alkaloids that are toxic to mammalian herbivores. The ergot alkaloids occur at relatively low concentrations in the plant and are often difficult to detect analytically. By contrast, the lolines frequently accumulate to very high levels in grass tissues, and were, therefore, initially associated also with toxicity to mammalian herbivores. Specifically, the lolines were thought to be responsible for toxic symptoms called fescue toxicosis displayed by livestock grazing on grasses infected by N. coenophialum. However, subsequently it was demonstrated that only the endophyte-produced ergot alkaloids are responsible for the symptoms of fescue toxicosis (or summer syndrome), and not the lolines which, even at high doses, have only very small physiological effects on mammalians feeders. Another group of alkaloids, the senecio-type alkaloids, are produced by various plants and like the lolines, the senecio alkaloids possess a pyrrolizidine ring structure. Unlike the lolines, however, the senecio alkaloids exhibit strong hepatotoxicity, owing to a double bond between C-1 and C-2 in their ring structure. This double bond is absent in the lolines, explaining the lack of hepatotoxicity of this group of compounds. The lolines have been suggested to inhibit seed germination or growth of other plants (allelopathy), and to increase resistance of infected grasses against drought, but such effects have not been substantiated under more natural conditions of cultivation or in habitats. Production and distribution in the grass plant Figure 3. Neotyphodium coenophialum hyphae in tall fescue leaf tissue. Lolines commonly accumulate in the N. coenophialum–tall fescue symbiosis, providing protection from insects and other environmental stresses. Lolines are produced by several grass–endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenoids, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines are produced at levels, however, that can exceed 10 mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2–20,000 μg/g), exceeding the concentrations of the other endophyte alkaloids by >1000-fold. Lolines produced in the grasses Lolium pratense (syn. Festuca pratensis, meadow fescue) and tall fescue infected by N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum (see Fig. 3), respectively, exhibit variable concentrations in grass tissues. Higher loline concentrations (100–1000 μg/g) are present in the seeds and in younger leaf tissues, and the lolines display seasonal changes in concentration levels throughout the plant. The periodical appearance of tissues with high loline concentrations, such as flowering stems and seeds, contributes to this seasonal variation. Loline concentrations often increase in grass tissues regrown after defoliation and clipping of plants, suggesting an inducible defense response mechanism, involving both symbiotic partners. However, this increase appears to be due to higher loline levels in younger leaves compared to older leaves, but loline increases resembling inducible plant defenses have also been reported. Variation of loline concentration with the developmental stage of specific grass tissues suggests regulation of in planta loline distributions, providing greater protection of newly grown or embryonic tissues against attacks by insects. Surprisingly, exogenous application of the plant signaling compound, methyl jasmonate—which commonly signals predation by insects—decreases expression of the genes for the lolines. The factors that control loline production vary also among endophyte- infected grass tissues: whereas plant-supplied amino acids that are loline precursors limit accumulation of lolines in many grass tissues, their production in tissues that bear external mycelial growth for fungal reproduction (stromata) is regulated by the expression of loline genes. Biosynthesis The lolines are structurally similar to pyrrolizidine alkaloids produced by many plants, notably the necine ring containing a tertiary amine. This led to the early hypothesis that the biosynthesis of the lolines is similar to that of the plant pyrrolizidines, which are synthesized from polyamines. However, feeding studies with carbon isotope–labeled amino acids or related molecules in pure cultures of the loline-producing fungus N. uncinatum recently demonstrated that the loline alkaloid pathway is fundamentally different from that of the plant pyrrolizidines. The basic loline chemical structure is assembled in several biosynthetic steps from the amino acid precursors, L-proline and L-homoserine. In the proposed first step in loline biosynthesis, these two amino acids are coupled in a condensation reaction linking the γ-carbon in homoserine to the secondary amine in proline in a PLP–type enzyme–catalyzed reaction to form the loline intermediate, N-(3-amino-3-carboxy)propylproline (NACPP). Further steps in loline biosynthesis are thought to proceed with sequential PLP-enzyme-catalyzed and oxidative decarboxylations of the carboxy groups in the homoserine and proline moieties, respectively, cyclization to form the core loline ring structure, and oxidation of the C-2 and C-7 carbons to give the oxygen bridge spanning the two pyrrolizidine rings. Genetic studies agree with the biosynthetic routes established in the precursor-feeding experiments. AFLP-based studies using crosses between strains of the endophyte, Epichloë festucae, that differ in the capacity to produce lolines, show that loline production and protection of the grass, Lolium giganteum, from feeding by the aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, segregate in a Mendelian fashion. The presence of a single locus for loline production was later confirmed by the finding that loline-producing epichloae endophytes contain a gene cluster (LOL cluster) of at least eleven genes. The LOL genes are greatly and coordinately upregulated during loline alkaloid production, and experimental genetic tests involving manipulation of selected LOL genes by RNA interference and gene knockout have directly confirmed the involvement of two of the LOL genes in loline biosynthesis. These tests and similarities in the peptide sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes to known enzymes indicate that one gene, termed lolC, is likely required for the first step in loline biosynthesis (condensation of L-proline and L-homoserine for NACPP formation), and another gene, lolP —likely encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase—, for oxygenation of one methyl group on the C-1 amine of N-methylloline, which gives the most abundant loline in many grass–endophyte symbiota, N-formylloline.

He is best known as the founder of the Kennel Club in Britain in 1873. Background and education A member of the Shirley family headed by the Earl Ferrers, Shirley was the son of Evelyn Shirley and Mary Clara Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Lechmere, 2nd Baronet. His paternal grandfather was Evelyn Philip Shirley. Shirley was born at the family's English estate of Ettington Park near Stratford-upon-Avon. He was educated at Eton before matriculating to Christ Church, Oxford in 1864, though he did not take a degree. He was presented to the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) at a special levée at St James's Palace on 1 June 1869. He was accompanied by his father, and was one of 350 gentlemen to be shown at the event. Political career Shirley's family had a long connection with County Monaghan in Ireland, and they owned a large estate at Lough Fea, Carrickmacross. Shirley entered Parliament for Monaghan (a seat previously held by both his father and grandfather) on 17 November 1868, and won election through a promise to defend the Protestant constitution. He continued to represent the constituency until 31 March 1880, but rarely spoke in Parliament, and is thought to have lost his seat when opposition Liberal supporters ran a successful campaign based on tenants' rights. He attempted to return to politics in 1885, standing against an Irish nationalist candidate for the newly created seat of South Monaghan, but was heavily defeated. Shirley was also a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for County Monaghan and served as High Sheriff of Monaghan in 1884. Although heavily involved in local affairs as initially guided by his father, and was involved in improvements to the estate such as the construction of a new church in 1865. But relations with the tenant farmers on his estates, which he inherited in 1882, remained poor. This, combined with forced evictions following the agricultural depression of the 1880s, led to his estate being targeted by the Irish nationalist Plan of Campaign. It also resulted in issues with the local railway, with a boycott by farmers of the station at Carrickmacross taking place in 1890. Dog breeding Throughout his life Shirley had a keen interest in dogs, both working dogs and pure breeds. His Fox Terrier won a silver cup at the Birmingham Dog Show in 1867, and three years later he repeated the victory with an English Bull Terrier. During his show career he also owned a variety of other breeds including Bulldogs, Collies and a number of Retrievers. In 1873 he brought together a group of similar minded people with the aim of creating an establishment of a governing body which would allow the definition of dog breeds to protect pedigrees and to improve the standards of hygiene at dog shows. Later that year, the Kennel Club was formed, with Shirley sitting as secretary from 1873 to 1899. He also acted as a dog judge, including at both shows across all types and in field trials for breeds such as Setters and Pointers. The last show he attended was the twentieth annual Hunter's Improvement Society, held at the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington less than a week prior to his death. He was also known for owning several racehorses. Family Prior to his marriage, he continued to reside at Ettington Park with his father and siblings. Shirley married Emily Jean, daughter of Colonel William Macdonald, in 1884. By the time of the 1891 census, he was the head of the household of Ettington Hall, along with his wife, their son Evelyn, and his widowed mother, Mary. Emily Jean died in July 1918. Death Shirley died in London on 7 March 1904 while there on a short visit. He was staying at the Hotel Windsor on Victoria Street and returned there by taxi after visiting his friends. Some early newspaper reports stated that he had been assaulted, with his watch and other valuables taken, but his obituaries omits those details. He was rushed to Westminster Hospital but died soon after he was admitted. The coroner later determined that the cause of death was a brain haemorrhage, and described the more elaborate reports as \\"the result of a lurid imagination\\".

It is similar to the Japanese video game Puyo Puyo originally released in 1991 by Compile for the MSX2.  Game play  A screenshot of Ka-glom! on the iOS platform. The objective of Ka-Glom! in Survival mode is to create explosions and chains of explosions using pieces that drop from top to bottom thereby accumulating the highest score possible before the stack of pieces reaches the top of the screen. Of the two block types, only the Ka-Glom jelly is explosive. Connect four Ka-Gloms of the same color to start an explosive reaction eliminating all connecting blocks of that color. In building huge chain-reacting explosions the Ka-Glom Factor increases and the bonus points multiply. The regular pieces drop in from the top in pairs, with two Ka-Gloms or at minimum a Ka-Glom and a Block. Players can rotate pieces as they drop, and try and combine the colors with other Ka-Gloms on the bottom. Gravity pulls the pieces toward the bottom, and increases slowly as play proceeds. When four Ka-Gloms of the same color are combined, they explode creating a reaction that explodes all blocks of that same color also. After the explosion, gravity pulls down the rest of the pieces, and could cause even more exploding Ka-Gloms. The Special pieces drop in one at a time. If a block is placed that extends above the screen, the game ends.http://www.magmic.com/game/KaGlom = Bonus points = The Ka-Glom Factor is a timed bonus meter. It consists of a Bar and a Multiplier. The Bar increases whenever blocks are destroyed. If there are explosion combinations, the Bar will increase faster. If the Bar fills up to the max, the multiplier increases to the next level. The Multiplier doubles or triples player scores as ever more blocks are destroyed. This is termed the Ka-Glom Factor. The better one plays, the better the Ka-Glom Factor. However, one must hurry as the Bar constantly decays over time. Players soon discover that chaining multiple explosions keeps the Ka-Glom Factor high and dramatically improves scores. = Time Attack = In Time Attack, play is against a 3, 5 or 8-minute timer to try to accumulate as many points as possible. = Puzzle Mode = In Puzzle Mode, preset situations exist that need a specific configuration to cause explosions to clear the screen fully.

He helped develop one of the two atomic bombs that was dropped on Japan in the closing days of the war. Later, he was a pioneer in the development of nuclear propulsion, nuclear weapons, guidance systems for ground- and air-launched rockets, and underwater anti-submarine weapons. A former batboy for the New York Yankees, Hayward dropped out of high school and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Navy at age 16. He was subsequently admitted to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, from which he graduated 51st in his class of 1930. He volunteered for naval aviation. During World War II, he served at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, where he was involved in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He attended the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and studied nuclear physics. In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators, which he led in a daring raid on Wake Island, in the Solomon Islands campaign, and in the Southwest Pacific Area. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California, where he joined the Manhattan Project, participating in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components of the Fat Man bomb, and in its drop testing. After the war ended, he travelled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as part of the team investigating the bomb damage, and during Operation Crossroads, he led the effort to photograph the nuclear explosion at the Bikini Atoll. In 1949, he assumed command of VC-5, the first naval nuclear bomber squadron. In March 1949, he took off from the carrier in the Atlantic in a Lockheed P2V Neptune bomber carrying a dummy Little Boy pumpkin bomb, flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on a test site in California., and flew back to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying. In August 1950, he was at the controls of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber. From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward was head of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he conducted atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In June 1953, he assumed command of the escort carrier , and was involved in the rescue of a baby who was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. In June 1954, he became the first naval aviator to command the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where he was involved with the development of the Mark 52 naval mine and the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge. He was Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development, and then Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development. In 1962 he assumed command of a carrier task force which included the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . He commanded the Antisubmarine Warfare Force, Pacific Fleet, from 1963 to 1966, and then was president of the Naval War College from 1966 until 1968. Early life Hayward was born in New York City on 15 November 1908 one of eight children of Charles Brian and Rosa Hayward, née Valdetaro. As a youngster, he was a batboy for the New York Yankees. In May 1925, he dropped out of high school at Loyola School and enlisted in the United States Navy by lying about his age, which at the time he believed to be only 15, and forging his father's signature on the papers. He soon acquired the nickname \\"Chick\\" from a bosun who asked \\"And how in did a little chick like you get in here amongst all these grown men?\\" The nickname would remain with him for the rest of his naval career. Hayward did his initial naval training at the Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward to be sent to the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one- hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406. After graduation, Hayward volunteered for naval aviation, and learned to fly in a Consolidated NY seaplane at Naval Air Station Hampton Roads. A tour of sea duty on the cruiser followed, after which he was posted to the Naval Air Station Pensacola to complete his flight training. He received his aviator's wings in July 1932. While there he met a local woman, Leila Marion (Lili) Hyer, and the two were married at St John's Church in Warrington, Florida, on 15 October 1932. Their marriage would produce five children. Hayward was posted to a scout bombing squadron, VS-1B, flying Vought SBU Corsairs, on the aircraft carrier on the West Coast, and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade), but owing to government austerity measures, was not paid as such. In 1935, the squadron was transferred to the . Coming in for a landing, a fuel line on his aircraft broke, spraying him with fuel and damaging his left eye. After he recovered, and his flight status was restored, he was sent to VP-2, which was stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, flying Martin PM patrol aircraft. Following a two-year tour there, he was assigned to the SON Seagull detachment aboard the newly commissioned cruiser , where he was promoted to lieutenant on 30 June 1937. He then repeated the procedure of commissioning the aircraft detachment of a new cruiser on another ship of the same class, the in 1938. World War IIPacific Theater= A Navy PB4Y bomber Hayward was posted to the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia in June 1940, where he continued graduate studies at Temple University that he had begun in 1937, and then attended the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, where he studied nuclear physics. At the Naval Aircraft Factory, he was involved in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in January 1942. In June 1942, Hayward assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators. He was promoted to commander in August 1942. VB-106 trained in Hawaii, and flew its first combat mission against Wake Island in October 1943. For this mission, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His citation read: Hayward was awarded a second Distinguished Flying Cross on the recommendation of Captain Arleigh Burke for leading his squadron in the South Pacific Area. His citation read: In March 1944, VB-106 was transferred to Nadzab in the Southwest Pacific Area, where it came under the command of the Fifth Air Force. It thus served in three different theaters in the Pacific. Hayward was awarded a third Distinguished Flying Cross: He was also awarded the Legion of Merit with the valor device: Somewhat depleted in both aircraft and aircrews, VB-106 handed over its three PB4Ys with the least hours on the clock to its relief, VB-115, on 27 May 1944, and returned to the United States. =Manhattan Project= Hayward's next posting was to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California. Initially he was involved with test firing rockets from various aircraft, including the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the twin engine Grumman F7F Tigercat. Once his security clearance was complete, he was assigned to the Manhattan Project. He participated in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components of the Fat Man bomb, and in its drop testing. This involved flying the four engine Boeing B-29 Superfortress. After the war ended, he travelled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki as part of the Manhattan Project team investigating the bomb damage. He was promoted to captain on 10 December 1945. During Operation Crossroads, he led the effort to photograph the nuclear explosion at the Bikini Atoll. Post warNuclear weapons= After a series of clashes with his superior at Inyokern, Captain James B. Sykes, Hayward left to become the Director for Plans and Operations for Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Sandia National Laboratories on 1 August 1947. On 1 January 1948, he was reduced in rank to commander again. The Air Force offered a commission as a brigadier general, and Convair offered a job working on the SM-65 Atlas missile, but Hayward elected to stay in the navy. He participated in the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests in the Pacific in April 1948. A P2V takes off from using JATO on 21 April 1950 After World War II, the US Navy sought to acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from aircraft carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; it could only be operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea. On 28 April 1948, two P2Vs were launched from a carrier, the , for the first time. The intention was that each of the three Midway-class carriers would have a nuclear attack squadron. The first of these, Composite (Heavy Attack) Squadron 5 (VC-5) was formed at Moffett Field, California, on 9 September 1948, with Commander Frederick L. \\"Dick\\" Ashworth, who had been weaponeer on the Nagasaki raid, as its acting commander. However, Rear Admiral Deak Parsons felt that Ashworth did not have sufficient flight time for the role, so it was decided that Hayward would command VC-5. He assumed command on 3 January 1949, with Ashworth as his executive officer. Hayward intended that Ashworth would take command of the next squadron, VC-6, when it was formed. A nuclear capable AJ Savage launches from the aircraft carrier in 1955 Hayward was promoted to captain again on 19 February 1949. On 7 March, he took off Coral Sea in the Atlantic in a P2V carrying a dummy Little Boy pumpkin bomb, and flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on the Salton Sea test site near El Centro, California. He then flew to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying. Hayward had tailhooks fitted to a pair of P2Vs, and made practice landings on a carrier deck painted on the ground at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, He made some touch and go passes at the , but a carrier landing was considered too dangerous for regular crews to attempt. The P2Vs would be first augmented, and then replaced, by the more capable North American AJ Savage as they became available. These could take off and land on a carrier, carrying a Fat Man. On 21 August 1950, Hayward was at the controls of the first carrier landing and takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber, on the Coral Sea with the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMAIRLANT), Vice Admiral Felix Stump, in the back seat. However, by mid- December VC-5 still only had six AJ-1s. From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward was head of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he conducted atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also worked on the foundation of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test. =Point Cruz= In June 1953, Hayward took command of the escort carrier . He confessed to the crew that he did not know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing something wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruz's chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: \\"You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby.\\" Hayward is credited with putting his naval career \\"on the line\\" by bringing the baby on the ship, which was against regulations, and he subsequently received orders to get the baby off the ship. However, having a baby on board boosted sailors' morale, and Hayward later said that a leader must \\"know when to intelligently disregard regulations.\\" A visa was obtained by intervention of Richard Nixon's staffers, and a passport was secured by winning a poker game against the South Korean who issued passports. The baby, adopted by Navy surgeon Hugh Keenan, who was also in port at Inchon, was later named Daniel, and was transferred to a civilian ship in Japan. Daniel Keenan was raised in Seattle and began attending reunions of the crew of the Point Cruz in 1993. The story of Daniel Keenan was made into a television movie, A Thousand Men and a Baby, which aired on CBS in 1997. =Later career= , and in 1964 Hayward assumed command of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the previous commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air- delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955. From a naval career point of view, Hayward's most notable drawback was his lack of time in command of a ship at sea. Admiral Arleigh Burke, now Chief of naval Operations, arranged for Hayward to be given command of the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt in February 1956. This would normally be the climax of naval aviator's career, but that year he was selected for promotion to rear admiral. His record of 13,200 flight hours was the highest ever achieved by a flag officer. On 7 January 1957, he was assigned to the office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Operations. In October, he became Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development. The very public failure of Project Vanguard resulted in Hayward being called to appear before a Congressional Committee, where he was grilled by its chairman, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. The post was upgraded to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development in 1959, and he was promoted to vice admiral. He pushed the development of a number of new weapons systems, including the Lockheed P-3 Orion and the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . Between 1959 and 1961, Defense expenditure on research and development grew from $525 million (roughly equivalent to $ in 20) to $4 billion (roughly equivalent to $ in 20). Hayward (left) and other dignitaries including Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney (at podium), and Admiral Arleigh Burke (third from right) attend the commissioning ceremony for the destroyer in 1991 In 1962, President John F. Kennedy offered Hayward four stars and the job of Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayward turned it down, accepting a demotion to rear admiral on 9 March 1962 to take command of Carrier Division 2, which included the nuclear-powered Enterprise, , and . In October 1962, his ships participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis. In June 1963, he was restored to the rank of vice admiral, which was backdated to 25 April 1959, the day he had first been promoted. He commanded the Antisubmarine Warfare Force, Pacific Fleet, from 13 June 1963 to 12 January 1966, for which he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his \\"leadership, judgment and foresight in research and development associated with antisubmarine warfare and the training of Antisubmarine Warfare Groups during his tenure of command.\\" Hayward was president of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island from 1966 until 1968. He strove to transform the Naval War College into the Navy's premier postgraduate school, one from which graduation would fit officers for, and mark them out as future flag officers. Heading a captain's selection board in May 1967, he disapproved of two officers with spotless records. \\"You mean they never argued, never had a difference of opinion?\\" he remarked. \\"What kind of man is that?\\" Hayward was awarded a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his service as president of Naval War College. He retired in 1968, but returned to serve to duty as a rear admiral from November 1970 to December 1971 as Commander, 14th Naval District, Commander Fleet Air Hawaii and Commander, Naval Base Pearl Harbor. His responsibilities included \\"the planning, training and execution of highly successful recoveries of Apollo spacecraft in the Mid-Pacific\\", for which he was awarded a third Legion of Merit. Later life After retiring from the Navy, Hayward worked for General Dynamics as a vice president for international programs until 1973, and then as a consultant until 1979. He then worked with the Draper Laboratory and the Hertz Foundation. He became an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Fellow in 1998, and was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor in 2004. Hayward joined a team of scientists that was sent to investigate the origins of the Shroud of Turin in Vatican City. While speaking at the Naval War College in 1982, Hayward said that the evidence collected during the investigation convinced him that the shroud was in fact used to bury Jesus Christ. However, he spoke only for himself and not the entire team. According to the rest of the team, the image on the shroud was rather formed by a combination of heat and light. Hayward decided that further research into the age of the shroud via Carbon-14 dating was needed but Church authorities would not permit this to happen at the time. Hayward died of cancer on 23 May 1999 in Atlantic Beach, Florida, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, along with his wife Leila, who had died the year before. He was survived by his son and four daughters. His papers are in the Naval History & Heritage Command at the Washington Navy Yard.

Although few people had FM radios, Wilkerson also applied for an FM station at 100.3. In 1956, WSM in Nashville, Tennessee closed its FM station, and Wilkerson did the same, believing that if such a big station couldn't succeed, he had no chance. Knoxville got its first FM station in 1966, and Wilkerson realized he may have made a mistake. WLIL-FM signed on at 93.5 in 1967.

Background Martin Gaffney was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1949. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1975 in Lowell, Massachusetts and would eventually rise to the rank of Chief Warrant Officer (CWO4). In 1978 on the Japanese island of Okinawa, Martin met Mutsuko Kuniyoshi. In late 1980 Mutsuko became pregnant with the couple's first child. On March 7, 1981 she and Martin married. She was two months pregnant when they married. Stillbirth of son and wife's infection with AIDS It was in September 1981 that Mutsuko Gaffney went to Long Beach Naval Hospital. In spite of her saying she felt labor pains, medical personnel sent the mother home on several occasions over a span of five weeks. Six weeks after Mutsuko's due date, she returned to the hospital. It was during tests that it was discovered the baby Mutsuko was carrying no longer had a heartbeat, and naval doctors performed an emergency caesarean section but it was too late for the boy Mutsuko was carrying, who weighed 11 pounds. As a result of the operation, Mutsuko was given a transfusion of two units of blood. Years later it was discovered that one of the blood donors had been discharged from the United States Navy for homosexual activity. The other donor tested negative for HIV. At the time of Mutsuko Gaffney's transfusion, there were no blood screening tests for the virus. It was also discovered that the donors had donated blood the day before Mutsuko Gaffney's caesarean section was performed. It is possible that she would not have been infected with HIV if Navy doctors had treated her and the unborn child she was carrying in a timely manner. AIDS diagnosis and federal lawsuit In 1983 and 1985 Mutsuko Gaffney gave birth again, first to a daughter named Maureene and then a son named John. John was a sickly child and tests were done to find out why. It was discovered John had AIDS, having contracted it from his mother who also tested positive for the disease. Mr. Gaffney recalled the reaction of his wife, to the news she had AIDS: Mutsuko turned to the doctor and asked for enough sleeping pills to commit suicide, he said. John Gaffney died at the age of thirteen months in August 1986. Mutsuko Gaffney died of AIDS on May 31, 1987 at age 38. Maureene Gaffney was tested for HIV but the results were negative. Martin Gaffney tested positive for HIV but showed no symptoms yet when he filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the federal government in 1988. In April 1989 a federal court ruled in Martin Gaffney's favor. U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel stating \\"infection with a communicable disease was a foreseeable consequence of administering blood to a patient even in 1981.\\" Martin Gaffney was awarded $3.8 million by a jury but the Federal government was initially slow in paying the judgment. By 1991 Martin Gaffney had come down with lymphoma. On October 10, 1991 the Federal government decided not to appeal the judgment. Less than a month later, Martin Gaffney died in a Boston, Massachusetts hospital. After the death of her father in 1991, Maureene Gaffney went to live with her paternal uncle, John Gaffney, and his wife, Sandra Gaffney (née Farber). John Gaffney died at age 54 in a plane crash in 1996, along with one of his three sons. As of 2019, Maureene Gaffney works as a manager and owner of M.F. Dulock Pasture-Raised Meats, a boutique butcher shop in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Biography He was born into a family of musicians in Seggiano in the province of Grosseto to parents originally from Montecelio, Lazio. After briefly studying electronics, he studied piano, violin and composition at the Conservatorio Rossini at Bologna, teaching music on his graduation. In 1947, after military service, he was appointed artistic director of the Metropolitan music hall in Naples, where he developed a liking for Neapolitan music. In 1948 he visited the United States for six months, meeting Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Kenton and Charlie Ventura. American jazz was also a formative influence. On his return, Marini wrote music for films and revues and played in cabaret in Rome and Naples. In 1954, he placed a newspaper advert seeking “young musicians without experience, singing in tune. If not cheerful, don't apply.\\" From the many applicants he chose Gaetano “Totò” Savio (guitar), Sergio (drums) and Ruggero Cori (bass and vocal) for a quartet, Marini playing piano and occasionally singing solo. This quartet played together from 1954 to 1960, a period regarded as the Marino Marini Quartet’s most prolific and successful. Marino Marini They made their first recording on the Durium label in 1955. The following year they appeared on Italian TV. Their recordings of \\"Guaglione\\", \\"Don Ciccio o' piscatore\\", \\"Rico Vacilon\\", \\"La Pansè\\", and \\"Maruzzella\\" were very popular, \\"Guaglione\\" becoming the first European single to sell more than five million copies. (It was used on the soundtrack of the 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley.) Following this successful debut, Marini commenced touring with his quartet, in the following years performing in hundreds of concerts in western and eastern Europe, the USA, the Middle East and Japan. Marini's recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s included covers of Domenico Modugno's \\"Volare\\" and \\"Ciao ciao bambina\\" and Rocco Granata's \\"Marina\\". In 1960, he won the first and the second prizes in the Naples song festival with \\"Serenata a Margellina\\" and \\"Uè uè uè che femmena\\". In 1958 he performed Mikis Theodorakis's \\"The Honeymoon Song\\" in Michael Powell's film Honeymoon. In 1960 the first quartet disbanded and in 1961 new quartet was formed with Marini, Bruno Guarnera (guitar), Pepito di Pace (drums) and Vittorio Benvenuti (bass, vocal, dance). The quartet was re-formed again in 1963 with Francesco Ventura (guitar), Sergio (drums), and Franco Cesarico (bass guitar and vocal). Marino Marini's music was rooted in the tradition of Italian song, and in particular Neapolitan song, as he sometimes performed in the Neapolitan language (e.g. \\"Maruzzella\\"). Many of his numbers are in 4/4 or 4/8 time, but he sometimes used the 6/8 tarantella rhythm with an off-beat tempo accentuated by the piano on the second and fourth beat. He performed in several styles and genres, reinterpreting American standards or current pop songs (e.g. \\"Just Young\\") and using dance rhythms such as cha-cha-cha, the twist, the letkiss and the samba. He often combined genres (e.g. Neapolitan song and samba in \\"Ciccio 'o piscatore\\"). He made innovative use of the echo chamber (using one made to his own design) and is said to have been the first European performer to use sound mixing on stage, anticipating the techniques used by rock musicians in the 1960s. Among the performers he influenced were the French singer Dalida and the French-Italian Caterina Valente. He retired from performing in 1966 but continued to compose.

Regular season The 1942–43 Illinois Fighting Illini men’s basketball team represented the University of Illinois. The Illinois Fighting Illini finished the season with a record of 17 wins and 1 loss. The season was cut short as three of the five starters headed off to active duty in the armed forces. Illinois won the Big Ten Conference Title and had finished the regular season as the nations' top ranked team. Paced by a group of players known as the Whiz Kids, the team consisted of 20-year-old All-America forward Andy Phillip and teenagers Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and team captain Art Mathisen. These players were so dominant in the Big Ten, that only Northwestern's Otto Graham could crack the all-conference team.http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0747268.html The Army drafted Mathisen, Menke and Smiley. That left only Vance and Phillip, both good enough to be selected to Illinois' All-Century team. Head coach Doug Mills made a decision in February 1943 that all five always supported, the club did not participate in either the NCAA or NIT tournament. Wyoming's NCAA championship that season may not have happened had Illinois’ season not coincided with World War II. The team was retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Four of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to Illinois and tried to recapture the glory for one more season in 1946–47 after the war ended, but the chemistry had changed as well as their talent. Illinois went 14–6.

Merrie Melodies animated cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 26, 1954, and stars Tweety, Sylvester and Granny. The title is a play on the Yiddish expression \\"mazel tov\\", which roughly translates to \\"good luck\\". Synopsis The story begins with Granny and two moving men in their truck (which reads \\"Checker Movers, It's Your Move\\") searching for her new house, which they soon find. The movers walk Granny's things past Sylvester as he is napping on top of the wall surrounding the house. Sylvester suddenly wakes up when the movers parade Tweety in his cage past him, and Tweety says: \\"I tawt I taw a puddytat!\\" Immediately, Sylvester starts to pursue Tweety atop the wall, but then crashes into a lamp post and falls off the wall. Sylvester climbs back up as Tweety is carried into the house, while another mover sets Hector's doghouse down on the ground. Sylvester steps down upon the roof of the doghouse as he comes down from the wall, and when Hector sees him, he likewise says: \\"I tawt I taw a puddytat!\\" Hector then bites Sylvester's tail and chases him back out to the street. Plotting to get past Hector and finagle his way into the house, Sylvester disguises himself as a lamp, putting a shade on his head. After a mover carries him in and sets him on the table next to Tweety's cage, Tweety plugs Sylvester's tail into the outlet, giving Sylvester a massive electric jolt. Hector bites Sylvester and also gets zapped, then chases him out of the house and back to the street again. Sylvester then tries posing as one of the movers...and gets Granny's piano loaded into his arms! Tweety guides Sylvester all the way up the stairs to the top floor and through a doorway, which sends Sylvester plummeting with the piano to the street below, prompting Tweety to remark: \\"Ooooh, dat wast step was a wuwu!\\" Making another attempt, Sylvester hides under a bear rug to sneak up on Tweety and climbs up to his cage. Granny, frightened at the sight, thinks the bear had been \\"playing 'possum for twenty years\\" and fires several pistol shots at Sylvester (a partial reference to The Fair-Haired Hare) before Hector chases him out again. Finally, Sylvester goes to the costume shop and dresses up full-body as a voluptuous female dog to lure Hector away from the front steps. As the instantly lovestruck Hector approaches, Sylvester is preparing to knock him out with a mallet, but before he does, a dog catcher captures Sylvester in his net and locks him in his truck. Outraged, Sylvester furiously pounds on the window, demanding the dog catcher to let him out, but the dog catcher isn't listening to a word. He then removes the rubber dog mask from his costume yelling, \\"I'm not a dog, I'm a cat! K-A-T!\\"—a fatal error, as all the dogs in the truck notice immediately and begin to attack him as the truck disappears down the street. Tweety then says: \\"Dere won't be no more puddytats awound to chase me now.\\", before he sees two cats in the room with lamp shades on their heads, to which he says: \\"Of tourse, I tould be wong.\\" Availability *VHS- Sylvester and Tweety's Tale Feathers *VHS- Looney Tunes Collectors Edition: Canine Corps ReferencesExternal links * Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

Sixteen businesses existed including a jug factory, hotels, taverns, blacksmith shop, tan yard, the \\"Temperance House\\" as well as the first established Methodist Church in the county. The Southern Military was established in the village by the Alabama State Legislature, but it was forced to close by the Civil War. Incorporation In October 2008 the Chambers County Commission petitioned Probate Court to forfeit the charter of the Town of Fredonia. The Probate Court ordered that Fredonia's charter be forfeited. A majority of the people in the town decided that they wanted to reinstate the town and, in order to do so, would first have to reverse the forfeiture. A group called \\"Free Fredonia Community\\" was formed and fundraising begun, an attorney was hired and an appeal was filed to reverse the forfeiture. While waiting for the case to come before the court, an election happened, and a number of the new commissioners agreed that the forfeiture should be reversed. In July 2011 the Chambers County Commission voted to reverse the forfeiture. On July 26, 2011, the court returned Fredonia to the status it held before forfeiture.

He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the eighth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. French debuted with the Tigers in 2009, then played with the Seattle Mariners in 2009 and 2010. Born in Kansas, French attended Heritage High School in Littleton, Colorado, where he was a Louisville Slugger Preseason High School All-American in his senior year. Drafted by the Tigers, he spent the next several years in their minor league system before making his debut with the team in 2009. He won his first game in the major leagues on July 9, then was traded to the Mariners on July 31 as part of a deal that brought Jarrod Washburn to Detroit to help the Tigers try to win the American League Central Division. With Seattle, French replaced Washburn in the starting rotation. He had more wins that year with them than he did in Detroit, but his earned run average (ERA) was higher. In 2010, he split the year between the Mariners and the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers, though after Ryan Rowland-Smith was placed on the disabled list on July 28, he spent the rest of the year in the Mariners' starting rotation. Twice, he took a no-hitter through five innings. At Tacoma, he tied for fifth in the Pacific Coast League in wins despite only pitching half the season for them; in Seattle, he had a 5–7 record and a 4.83 ERA. French would never appear in a Major League Baseball game again after 2010. He spent all of 2011 with Tacoma, where his ERA was 6.27. Allowed to become a free agent after the season, he pitched one final season in the Minnesota Twins organization in 2012. Early life Luke was born to Greg and Colleen French on September 13, 1985, in Salina, Kansas. He grew up rooting for the Seattle Mariners, listing Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, and Jay Buhner among his favorite players. At Heritage High School in Littleton, Colorado, he played football, basketball, and baseball. After his freshman year, he stopped playing football to focus more on baseball; then after his sophomore year, he quit basketball for the same reason. As a senior, he was a Louisville Slugger Preseason High School All-American selection. French was selected to play in the inaugural Aflac All-America High School Baseball Classic on August 23, 2003 at Hammond Stadium in Ft. Myers, Florida. He said this about the experience: At the end of his senior year, French was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the eighth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. Professional careerDetroit Tigers= In 2004, French began his minor league career with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) Tigers. In 11 games (10 starts), he had a 1–3 record, a 2.74 earned run average (ERA), 49 strikeouts, and 19 walks in innings pitched. French split the next season between the GCL Tigers, the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League, and the Single-A advanced Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League (FSL). In 12 starts among all three, he had a 5–3 record, a 5.45 ERA, 50 strikeouts, and 87 hits allowed in innings pitched. French spent all of 2006 with West Michigan. Used exclusively as a starter in his 26 appearances, he had an 11–8 record, a 3.72 ERA, 94 strikeouts, and 156 hits allowed in innings pitched. His 11 wins tied with three other starters for seventh in the Midwest League, and his innings pitched ranked sixth. For the 2007 season, French spent the whole year with Lakeland. He finished second in the FSL with 14 losses (behind Zach Ward with 17), tied for second with 27 starts (tied with three others behind Tyler Norrick's 28), and finished fourth with 149 innings pitched (behind Norrick's , Drew Carpenter's 163, and Brandon Magee's ) in 2007. French earned a promotion to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves in 2008. He went 9–11 with a 4.02 ERA in 27 games (26 starts). French led the Eastern League with 170 innings pitched and 195 hits allowed, while he tied Brad Bergesen and Magee for the lead with three complete games, finished second with the same amount of losses as four other starters (11, behind Magee's 13), and gave up the fifth-most walks in the league (60, tied for fifth with Kyle Aselton). In 2009, French began the year with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. He was called up to the Tigers on May 14, 2009, when Nate Robertson was placed on the disabled list retroactive to May 6. He said he was very excited about the chance to pitch in the major leagues: He made his major league debut on May 15 in the 9th inning of a 14–1 victory over the Oakland Athletics. French appeared in one more game before being optioned back to Toledo on May 21 after Robertson returned from the disabled list. At Toledo, French went 4–4 with a 2.98 ERA in 13 games (all starts). He was called up at the end of June, this time to serve as a starter, replacing Alfredo Figaro on the Tigers' roster. On July 3, he made his first major league start, holding the Minnesota Twins to two runs over innings. He got a no-decision, but the Tigers won 11–9. Six days later, he logged his first major league win, holding the Kansas City Royals to one run over innings in a 3–1 triumph, defeating Zack Greinke, who would go on to win the American League (AL) Cy Young Award in 2009. It was his only win in seven games (five starts) for the Tigers through the end of July, but French posted a 3.38 ERA in that span. =Seattle Mariners= Though they led the AL Central through the 2009 season's first four months, the Tigers wanted some help for their rotation as they sought to make the playoffs. On July 31, 2009, French and prospect Mauricio Robles were traded to the Seattle Mariners for Jarrod Washburn. The trade brought French to the team he rooted for as a kid: French replaced Washburn in Seattle's rotation and won his first start for the Mariners. In his August 5 debut, he gave up four runs over five innings but again defeated the Royals in an 11–6 victory. On August 15, he was the losing pitcher in a 5–2 defeat by the New York Yankees, but all four runs French allowed were unearned, the result of a Franklin Gutiérrez error in the second inning. After he started for the Mariners on September 5, manager Don Wakamatsu moved him to the bullpen so the team could use Brandon Morrow in the starting rotation. French was only used once the rest of the year, on September 19. In eight games (seven starts) for Seattle, he had a 3–3 record, a 6.63 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 54 hits allowed in 38 innings. His combined totals between Seattle and Detroit were a 4–5 record, a 5.21 ERA, 42 strikeouts, and 87 hits allowed in innings. Safeco Field was French's home ballpark during his time with the Mariners. In 2010, French started the season with Tacoma, where he had a 6–2 record and a 1.93 ERA (second in the league) through June 6. On that day, he was recalled by the Mariners to work out of the bullpen when Doug Fister went on the disabled list. He made two relief appearances and started a game on June 14 in place of Ian Snell, who had not been pitching well. French allowed four runs in four innings in a 9–3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Four days later, French was optioned back to Tacoma. (Note: For transaction info, may need to click \\"more\\" under transactions section) He was briefly recalled on July 9, making a relief appearance against the Yankees before being sent back to Tacoma the next day. After Ryan Rowland- Smith was placed on the disabled list, French was called up on July 28 to take his spot in the Mariners' rotation. He remained in the rotation the rest of the year. On August 6, he again beat Greinke and the Royals, limiting Kansas City to one run over eight innings in a 7–1 victory. Eleven days later against the Baltimore Orioles, he had a no-hitter going until Josh Bell had a single with one out in the sixth inning, but he allowed no runs in innings as the Mariners won 4–0. On August 29, he held the Twins to three hits in seven innings. One of the hits was a home run by Michael Cuddyer, but Seattle scored two runs to defeat Minnesota 2–1. Five days later, French carried a no-hitter through six innings before Shelley Duncan singled with one out in the seventh. He finished the game with seven scoreless innings and got the win as Seattle beat the Cleveland Indians 1–0. His season ended poorly, as he gave up eight runs in four innings on October 1 against the Oakland Athletics in what ESPN called \\"the worst of his 13 [2010] starts for the Mariners.\\" French glumly reviewed his performance, saying, \\"All I can say is it wasn't my night. It's going to happen. It's not very fun, not the way you want to end the season.\\" In 17 starts for Tacoma in 2010, French had an 11–3 record, a 2.94 ERA, 63 strikeouts, and 109 hits allowed in innings pitched. Though he only made 17 starts for Tacoma, his 11 wins tied with six others for fifth in the league. Additionally, his .786 winning percentage was the third-highest among starters with at least 100 innings pitched in the PCL. In 16 games (13 starts) with Seattle, he had a 5–7 record, a 4.83 ERA, 37 strikeouts, and 88 hits allowed in innings. French participated in spring training in 2011 for the Mariners, competing for a long relief spot in the bullpen. He was sent to Tacoma at the end of spring training. On August 13, 2011, French was designated for assignment by the Mariners to allow Wily Mo Peña onto the team's 40-man roster. In 26 starts for Tacoma, he had a 9–9 record, a 6.27 ERA, and 81 strikeouts in innings. He ranked among PCL leaders in runs allowed (115, second to Alan Johnson's 118), earned runs allowed (102, second to Johnson's 109 and Chris Seddon's 104), and hits allowed (196, fifth in the PCL). The Mariners allowed him to become a free agent after the season. =Minnesota Twins organization= French signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins on January 27, 2012. He split the season between the Eastern League's New Britain Rock Cats and the International League's Rochester Red Wings. In nine starts for New Britain, he had a 4–1 record, a 2.10 ERA, 27 strikeouts, and 35 hits allowed in innings. With Rochester, he appeared in 19 games, 14 of which were starts. He had a 1–5 record, a 6.42 ERA, 49 strikeouts, and 90 hits allowed in innings. On November 3, he became a free agent. Further biography Before he reached the major leagues in 2009, French married his wife, Blythe. He threw a fastball, slider, and changeup during his baseball career. When the Tigers played the Mariners in 2009, Griffey (back with the Mariners for his final season) gave French, who was a fan of his growing up, an autographed jersey. Griffey later became his teammate on the Mariners. \\"Mike Sweeney and I were talking when he walked up and stood there near us,\\" Griffey recalled French's first day with the team. \\"We knew he wanted to introduce himself, so when we were done talking, both of us turned and started to walk away. Luke had his hand out and he just stared. Then I turned around and said, 'I'm just messin' with you.'\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Baseball players from Kansas Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Sportspeople from Salina, Kansas Category:Gulf Coast Tigers players Category:West Michigan Whitecaps players Category:Lakeland Tigers players Category:Lakeland Flying Tigers players Category:Erie SeaWolves players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Tacoma Rainiers players Category:New Britain Rock Cats players Category:Rochester Red Wings players ","title":"Luke French"},{"id":"22802738","text":"Nelson Walter Demarco Riccardi (February 6, 1925 - July 21, 2009) was a basketball player from Uruguay, who competed in three Olympics.

The pharmacological agents usually belong to a class of drugs called sedatives, which exert their action by depressing the central nervous system, specifically those areas concerned with conscious awareness. There are different degrees of central nervous system depression, each corresponding to a level of relaxation which ranges from minimal, moderate, to deep sedation. In general, minimal sedation refers to a patient who has reduced anxiety but readily responds to verbal or physical stimulation. With moderate sedation the patient is even more relaxed, and will respond to purposeful stimulation. In deep sedation, the patient may not exhibit any signs of consciousness and therefore be unresponsive to stimulation. Sedation by pharmacologic methods may be obtained by two general routes. The enteral route involves absorption of medication across enteric membranes which line the alimentary canal from the oral cavity, through the digestive tract, ending in the rectum. This route includes medications that are either swallowed, absorbed through the mucosa of the oral cavity, or inserted rectally. The parenteral route involves the administration of sedative drugs other than absorption across enteric membranes (outside of the alimentary canal). These methods include intravenous, inhalation, intramuscular, and submucosal administration, among others.  Sedation for children  Although researchers are calling for further studies to be carried out, current research indicates that oral midazolam is a useful sedative drug for pediatric patients. Nitrous oxide inhalation has also proven to be useful method to treat anxious children.

Formation of biexcitons  In quantum information and computation, it is essential to construct coherent combinations of quantum states. The basic quantum operations can be performed on a sequence of pairs of physically distinguishable quantum bits and, therefore, can be illustrated by a simple four-level system. In an optically driven system where the  0 1 \\\\rangle and  1 0 \\\\rangle states can be directly excited, direct excitation of the upper  1 1 \\\\rangle level from the ground state  0 0 \\\\rangle is usually forbidden and the most efficient alternative is coherent nondegenerate two-photon excitation, using  0 1 \\\\rangle or  1 0 \\\\rangle as an intermediate state. Model for a single quantum dots. E_b is the biexciton binding energy  Observation of biexcitons  Three possibilities of observing biexcitons exist: (a) excitation from the one-exciton band to the biexciton band (pump- probe experiments); (b) two-photon absorption of light from the ground state to the biexciton state; (c) luminescence from a biexciton state made up from two free excitons in a dense exciton system.  Binding energy of biexcitons  The biexciton is a quasi-particle formed from two excitons, and its energy is expressed as :E_{XX} = 2 E_{X} - E_{b} where E_{XX} is the biexciton energy, E_{X} is the exciton energy, and E_{b} is the biexciton binding energy. When a biexciton is annihilated, it disintegrates into a free exciton and a photon. The energy of the photon is smaller than that of the biexciton by the biexciton binding energy, so the biexciton luminescence peak appears on the low-energy side of the exciton peak. The biexciton binding energy in semiconductor quantum dots has been the subject of extensive theoretical study. Because a biexciton is a composite of two electrons and two holes, we must solve a four-body problem under spatially restricted conditions. The biexciton binding energies for CuCl quantum dots, as measured by the site selective luminescence method, increased with decreasing quantum dot size. The data were well fitted by the function :B_{XX} = \\\\frac{c_1}{a^2} + \\\\frac{c_2}{a} + B_{bulk} where B_{XX} is biexciton binding energy, a is the radius of the quantum dots, B_{bulk} is the binding energy of bulk crystal, and c_1 and c_2 are fitting parameters. = A simple model for describing binding energy of biexcitons = In the effective-mass approximation, the Hamiltonian of the system consisting of two electrons (1, 2) and two holes (a, b) is given by :H_{XX} = - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m_e^*} ({ abla_1}^2 + { abla_2}^2) - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m_h^*} ({ abla_a}^2 + { abla_b}^2) + V where m_e^* and m_h^* are the effective masses of electrons and holes, respectively, and :V = V_{12} - V_{1a} - V_{1b} - V_{2a} - V_{2b} + V_{ab} where V_{ij} denotes the Coulomb interaction between the charged particles i and j (i, j = 1, 2, a, b denote the two electrons and two holes in the biexciton) given by :V_{ij} = \\\\frac{e^2}{\\\\epsilon \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j} where \\\\epsilon is the dielectric constant of the material. Denoting \\\\mathbf{R} and \\\\mathbf{r} are the c.m. coordinate and the relative coordinate of the biexciton, respectively, and M = m_e^* + m_h^* is the effective mass of the exciton, the Hamiltonian becomes :H_{XX} = - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{4 M} { abla_R}^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{M} { abla_r}^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 \\\\mu} ({ abla_{1a}}^2 + { abla_{2b}}^2) + V where 1/\\\\mu = 1/{m_e^*} + 1/{m_h^*}; { abla_{1a}}^2 and { abla_{2b}}^2 are the Laplacians with respect to relative coordinates between electron and hole, respectively. And { abla_r}^2 is that with respect to relative coordinate between the c. m. of excitons, and { abla_R}^2 is that with respect to the c. m. coordinate \\\\mathbf{R} of the system. In the units of the exciton Rydberg and Bohr radius, the Hamiltonian can be written in dimensionless form :H_{XX} = - ({ abla_{1a}}^2 + { abla_{2b}}^2) - {2 \\\\sigma}{(1 + \\\\sigma)^2} { abla_r}^2 + V where \\\\sigma = {m_e^*}/{m_h^*} with neglecting kinetic energy operator of c. m. motion. And V can be written as :V = 2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{1a}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{1b}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{2a}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{2b}} + \\\\frac{1}{r_{ab}}\\\\right) To solve the problem of the bound states of the biexciton complex, it is required to find the wave functions \\\\psi satisfying the wave equation :H_{XX} \\\\psi = E_{XX} \\\\psi If the eigenvalue E_{XX} can be obtained, the binding energy of the biexciton can be also acquired :E_{b} = 2 E_{X} - E_{XX} where E_{b} is the binding energy of the biexciton and E_{X} is the energy of exciton. = Numerical calculations of the binding energies of biexcitons = The diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method provides a straightforward means of calculating the binding energies of biexcitons within the effective mass approximation. For a biexciton composed of four distinguishable particles (e.g., a spin-up electron, a spin-down electron, a spin-up hole and a spin-down hole), the ground-state wave function is nodeless and hence the DMC method is exact. DMC calculations have been used to calculate the binding energies of biexcitons in which the charge carriers interact via the Coulomb interaction in two and three dimensions, indirect biexcitons in coupled quantum wells, and biexcitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors. = Binding energy in nanotubes = Biexcitons with bound complexes formed by two excitons are predicted to be surprisingly stable for carbon nanotube in a wide diameter range. Thus, a biexciton binding energy exceeding the inhomogeneous exciton line width is predicted for a wide range of nanotubes. The biexciton binding energy in carbon nanotube is quite accurately approximated by an inverse dependence on r, except perhaps for the smallest values of r. :E_{XX} \\\\approx \\\\frac{0.195 eV}{r} The actual biexciton binding energy is inversely proportional to the physical nanotube radius. Experimental evidence of biexcitons in carbon nanotubes was found in 2012. = Binding energy in CuCl QDs = The binding energy of biexcitons increase with the decrease in their size and its size dependence and bulk value are well represented by the expression :\\\\frac{78}{{a^*}^2} + \\\\frac{52} + 33 (meV) where a^* is the effective radius of microcrystallites in a unit of nm. The enhanced Coulomb interaction in microcrystallites still increase the biexciton binding energy in the large- size regime, where the quantum confinement energy of excitons is not considerable.

She was due to be extradited back to Italy to serve her sentence, having exhausted her appeal rights against her extradition in Portugal, when the President of Italy issued her a pardon ending extradition proceedings against her in February 2017. She was still due to serve community service when she left Italy for the US in October 2019 citing fears for her safety. Sousa claims to be a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) field officer who used diplomatic cover. In 2009 she sued the U.S. State Department, claiming that the State Department should grant her diplomatic immunity for her role in the kidnapping, irrespective of the fact that diplomatic immunity is granted by the host country. The State Department denied that she had diplomatic immunity, and she lost her lawsuit against the State Department. In a July 27, 2013 interview with the McClatchy News Service, she said that she worked undercover for the CIA when the kidnapping took place. She maintains she played no role in the kidnapping, was unaware of the plans, and was on a ski trip when it took place. Background Sousa was born in Goa, India and grew up in Bombay (now Mumbai). She is a citizen of Portugal and the United States, having obtained her U.S. citizenship in 1985. De Sousa's role in the kidnapping and torture of Abu Omar The underlying case is called the \\"Imam Rapito affair\\", which involves \\"kidnapping charges in Italy for the seizure of a suspected terrorist.\\"Nedra Pickler, \\"Lawsuit seeks diplomatic immunity in Italian case,\\" Associated Press, slightly different versions found at Kansas City Star website, AOL New Zealand website, CBS website, and The Herald online.

Abu Omar, a Muslim cleric, was abducted on February 17, 2003, in Milan by the CIA, and transported to the Aviano Air Base, from which he was transferred to Egypt, where he was interrogated (and allegedly tortured). (Abu Omar is also known as Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr and Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr.) The Italian government originally denied having played any role in the abduction, but Italian prosecutors Armando Spataro and Ferdinand Enrico Pomarici indicted two dozen American and Italian government employees and agents.\\"Rapimento Abu Omar, a giudizio l'ex capo del Sismi Nicolò Pollari\\", La Repubblica, 16 febbraio 2007.

She was convicted of kidnapping for her role in the Imam rapito affair on November 4, 2009 by an Italian court, after a trial in absentia and a plea of not guilty. She was briefly detained at the Lisbon airport in Portugal on October 5, 2015. Her passport was confiscated, and she is awaiting a decision on whether she will be turned over to Italy to serve her six-year sentence. In January 2016, she was ordered extradited to Italy, although that order will be appealed. She has disclaimed any involvement in the affair and has been working to clear her name, including writing a memoir about her activities. Her appeal was denied on April 11, 2016. On April 11, 2016, the Portuguese Supreme Court upheld De Sousa's extradition. According to the New York Times, she will be filing a further appeal to Portugal's Constitutional Court, due to a difference between how Portugal and Italy handle convictions in absentia. According to the New York Times she will argue that if she were extradited she could not count on Italy granting her a re-trial, whereas a right to a re-trial is routinely allowed in Portugal. On 8 June 2016, the Portuguese Constitutional Court upheld the Supreme Court's decision. Sabrina de Sousa was due to be extradited to Italy at that time. De Sousa's lawsuit De Sousa sued for a declaration that she is a diplomat with immunity from prosecution: De Souza tried to appeal her extradition on the grounds that the CIA had documents that would establish she did not play the roles in the kidnapping for she was convicted, but that the documents were unavailable for her to use to defend herself, because they were classified as secrets. Extradition De Souza eventually lost all her appeals against extradition. In an email to the Associated Press De Souza's lawyers wrote that Portuguese authorities took her into custody on February 20, 2017, and that she would be transferred to Italian custody within a few days. Even though De Sousa exhausted all her appeals in Portugal's Justice system, she will be entitled to appeal her conviction, or request a new trial, once she is extradited to Italy, because she was convicted in absentia, and wasn't formally advised of her trial. On February 28, 2017, the New York Times reported that, Sergio Mattarella, the President of Italy, had commuted De Sousa's sentence, to just three years. They reported that Italian law allowed convicts sentenced to three years or less to serve an alternate sentence, like house arrest, instead of prison time. De Sousa's initial sentence had been for seven years, and had previously been reduced to four years. After Mattarella's partial commutation of De Sousa's sentence Italian prosecutors revoked their extradition order. De Sousa had expressed confidence that, when inaugurated Donald Trump would save her from imprisonment. When Mattarella did partially pardon her, there was widespread speculation that Italy was succumbing to diplomatic pressure from the newly inaugurated President. In October 2019 De Sousa left Italy for the U.S. because \\"she fears for her safety\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/sabrina-de-sousa-cia-spy- italy-milan-hassan-mustafa-osama-nasr-a9173296.html See also * Jeffrey W.

History Accepted into the Standard of Perfection by the American Poultry Association in 1874, the original strain of Buff turkey was used in the development of the Bourbon Red breed, but had died out entirely by the early 20th century. This was partly due to the difficulty in selectively breeding the proper color pattern, and also to the rise of new commercial breeds on the market. In the 1940s, interest in a buff turkey was revived, and a new strain of the breed — called the New Jersey Buff after where it was developed — was created. Still, the Broad Breasted White continued to edge out all other heritage turkey breeds like the Buff, and today is critically endangered, according to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. It has also been included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste. The breed is most popular in the U.S., but is also found in the U.K. and Australia. Characteristics The Buff has a very light or reddish brown plumage, which is its defining characteristic. A trait that drew interest from breeders is the fact that the lighter feathers of the breed present an easier, cleaner carcass. However, it has not been aggressively selected for production characteristics, and is thus significantly smaller than many modern breeds. Young toms weigh around 21 pounds and mature hens weigh roughly 12 pounds.

The station increased its power to 5,000 watts in 1955. WLIK's office, studios and transmission facilities were seriously damaged by a fire in 1958, reputed to be caused by a roof mounted neon sign. The station quickly resumed operations, with a mostly concrete block structure replacing the former wooden building.

Main charactersSam Oliver= The protagonist of the show, Sam Oliver (played by Bret Harrison) is a college dropout and all-around slacker who, thanks to a deal made by his parents in order to save his father's life, becomes a bounty hunter for the Devil when he turns 21. He dates his manager Andi. Upon learning of his infernal debt, Sam initially thought that he was instantly doomed to be dragged down to Hell, only to be informed by the Devil that he is required to function as a bounty hunter for Hell - for the rest of his life. He now collects souls for the Devil using various vessels (which vary by episode), with the assistance of his best friends Sock and Ben. A quitter by nature, Sam's morality was immediately pressed when he realized that if he didn't go along with his part of the bargain, more and more people would be hurt because he failed to capture the escaped souls. Sam is also given various powers to capture each soul, but these are often as much a hindrance as a help. In the season one finale, it is revealed that at least one of these abilities was retained from when Sam inadvertently used telekinesis trying to save a large heavy box from falling onto Andi's head on the pilot episode, by preventing a washing machine from falling onto himself in the last episode. In the second season he admits that he does not yet have full control over his \\"devil powers.\\" Near the end of season 1, Sam and Andi start a relationship briefly after she discovers Sam is the Devil's bounty hunter for hell. At the end of season one, the demon Tony tells Sam that he believes Sam's parents were paid by the Devil to carry his (the Devil's) baby, though Sam's mother denied this, and the Devil admits that he would probably not answer Sam honestly if asked about it. Later, the Devil says that Sam is his son, while the father who raised Sam, Mr. Oliver, tells Sam that the deal with the Devil will not allow him to tell Sam the truth of the matter. All other characters who know about the claim assume that Sam, though kindhearted, is indeed the Devil's son. During season 2, Sam discovers an escaped soul, Alan, that can't be sent back to hell because he claims he escaped the Devil. Sam continues throughout the season hunting down Alan, trying to get information on how to escape his contract. In \\"Underbelly,\\" the Devil hints that Sam is invulnerable. In \\"The Home Stretch,\\" Sam inadvertently wins a competition with his half-brother Morgan and is appointed the Devil's right- hand man. In the words of the Devil, he is \\"my right-hand man, my human representative in this realm, serving at my side as we create hell on earth.\\" In \\"No Reaper Left Behind\\", the Devil tells Sam, \\"I expect you to rise to the heights of political power here on earth, seize control of the planet, and hasten the Apocalypse.\\" Andi breaks up with Sam once Morgan revealed to her that Sam is the son of the Devil. She stated she recognized evil within him, and she can't deal with it. Even though she ended the relationship, Andi continues to assist Sam in capturing souls. =Bert \\"Sock\\" Wysocki= The lowest-performing salesperson at the Work Bench, Bert \\"Sock\\" Wysocki (played by Tyler Labine) spends most of his time sleeping in the stock shelves, planning his topless home supply store, and other time-wasting activities. He won the dog of the month award (the opposite of employee of the month) nine months in a row. He also regularly steals supplies from the Work Bench which aids Sam in capturing souls or he just uses them for fun (like making a mechanic bull from paint mixers and lumber). Fortunately, he is braver and more athletic than his slacker persona suggests, and often provides the muscle of Sam's group. Sock assists Sam with collecting souls. Sock lived with his mother for the majority of the first season but had to move out after she re- married in Las Vegas. After being kicked out, he first lives in the Work Bench but then he finds an apartment and forges Sam's and Ben's signatures on the lease and they live there for the rest of the season. At the start of the show Sock and Josie have just broken their relationship off but they get back together in the 14th episode and break off again in the final episode, with Josie saying that Sock is a bad boyfriend. In the last episode of the first season Sock kissed the succubus Marlena multiple times, losing one year from his life for each kiss (he estimates he has three years left). In the beginning of the second season it is revealed that Sock has a beautiful Asian stepsister whom he finds sexually appealing and considers asking out. He continues down this path, even with his new sister continually viewing him as a big brother, and eventually convinces her that there is nothing wrong with them sleeping together which they do in the second season episode \\"Underbelly.\\" She leaves for Japan shortly after. Sock is also one of four characters other than Sam who have captured a soul (the others being Andi, Ben, and Morgan). He captured the blob soul in episode five (\\"What About Blob\\") with the sweater vessel, and in the season finale (\\"Cancun\\"), he caught the fortune teller soul by throwing the baseball vessel through her car window after the fortune teller tried to run over both Sam and himself. In the first episode of season 2 (\\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\"), he captured one of the 40 fight club souls with the cattle prod vessel. =Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Gonzalez= One of Sam and Sock's co-workers and friends, Benjamin Casper Perez Gonzalez (played by Rick Gonzalez) knows Sam is working for Satan and helps him out. He seems to have a tendency to get hurt when assisting Sam in capturing escaped souls (though this tendency diminished as the series progressed, partially because he doesn't go soul-hunting along with Sam as extensively as Sock does). In the series pilot he is sent to the hospital by the fire soul and consumed by the blob monster in episode 5 (\\"What about Blob\\"), was held hostage in episode 10, (\\"Cash Out\\"), and hit by a 2×4 along with his friends while fighting two of the 40 fight club souls (Episode IV \\"A New Hope\\"). However in \\"Dirty Sexy Mongol\\" Ben shows a rare side of bravery fending off a demon with a tiki torch, thereby saving Sam from the would-be assassin. Ben is initially seen as the brains of the trio as he is usually the one responsible for coming up with tactics and strategies in aiding Sam capture escaped souls, and is not above recommending and taking advantage of the Work Bench's merchandise as makeshift hunting gear whenever the three conduct a hunt; he initially sought training as a priest and has an extensive knowledge of the Bible, and often raises theological questions about the nature of their missions and the Devil's involvement. Ben appears far less competent when he agrees to a green card marriage with his British co-worker Sara. He had just given up on his search for the perfect girl, who happens to be independently wealthy, enjoys mixed martial arts, and reads Sue Grafton novels. Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criterion for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, though she has no qualms about her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child. When Ben's sham marriage is discovered by an INS agent, he is told he is going to jail. He gets money together to pay a fine in lieu of jail time, but Sara tricks him into giving her the money so that she can go on the lam. At the end of the episode \\"The Leak\\", Cassidy drives Ben to jail, telling Sock \\"When this is all over, my boyfriend will no longer be married.\\" Early in the next episode, \\"Cancun,\\" Ben arrives at the Work Bench disappointed that his friends forgot to pick him up after serving his eight-day sentence. Ben is one of four people who have captured a soul for Sam (the others are Morgan, Sock and Andi) – he captured the tentacle soul in episode 24 (\\"Underbelly\\") with Sam's grenade vessel. In season two, he begins dating Nina, a demon. In \\"The Home Stretch\\", he breaks up with her at the insistence of his domineering grandmother, but gets back together with her in \\"No Reaper Left Behind\\". =Andi Prendergast= Andi Prendergast (played by Missy Peregrym in the series and Nikki Reed in the unaired pilot) is Sam's manager and girlfriend. Initially unaware of Sam's Reaper duties, she is let down multiple times when Sam is called away from dates to capture souls. Chancing to see him on duty, Andi watches Sam behead an escaped soul from a distance, and initially threatens to go to the police. Sam is warned by the Devil to ensure she remains unaware of his activities, but eventually he receives permission to let her know what he does. With help from Sam's neighbor (and demon) Tony, as well as from the escaped soul at the time, Sam convinces Andi of his \\"job\\". Andi reacts poorly, but eventually accepts Sam's fate and becomes his third assistant in hunting souls, though her assistance seems more focused on research rather than actual confrontation. Sam and Andi start dating near the end of season one but ends abruptly in \\"Underbelly\\" because Andi discovers from Morgan that Sam is the son of the devil. She can't handle this and believes that evil is brewing within Sam. Although they broke up, Andi continues to help Sam on his quest to get out of his deal with the Devil. Andi is one of four people who have captured a soul for Sam (the others are Ben, Morgan, and Sock) - she captured the multiplying soul in episode 15 (\\"Coming to Grips\\") with Sam's scythe vessel. =John Oliver= Mr. John Oliver (played by Andrew Airlie) is possibly Sam's father. Though equally distressed by his son's predicament as his wife, he, in effect, works against Sam for the protection of his family. In one episode, Mr. Oliver is seen burning a page from the contract which binds Sam to the devil, to hide information from Sam (which he later admits to in the season finale). It is implied that not only may he not be Sam's father, but that he possesses some degree of supernatural power; it is not known whether or not it had something to do with the \\"cure\\" the Devil provided him more than 21 years ago prior to the deal he made involving the then-unborn Sam at that time (as to the fact that he survived being buried alive). In the season two premiere (\\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\"), Sam is confident that the Devil is his true father, not Mr. Oliver. After surviving being buried alive at the end of Season 1, Mr. Oliver reappears as a zombie. Sam sees him again in \\"The Favorite\\" when delivering a fridge to his mother's house. Mr. Oliver explains that he cannot die because of the deal with the Devil that cost Sam his soul. As a zombie, he cannot go out in public and needs to be kept cool. His deceased status gives him plenty of free time, which he attempts to spend rekindling his relationship with Sam. At the end of \\"I Want My Baby Back,\\" Mr. Oliver moves into the garage of Sock's parents' house and sleeps in a fridge. In \\"No Reaper Left Behind,\\" Mr. Oliver attempts to regain some semblance of a normal life through the use of the internet, only to be disappointed. In an effort to find some purpose, he asks Sam to send him to Hell in an attempt to locate Alan Townsend and help Sam get out of his deal. Sam agrees and captures him with the Nerf gun vessel. =The Devil= Smooth-talking and debonair, known as \\"Jerry Belvedere\\" to those who have no idea of his true identity, the Devil (played by Ray Wise) claims the rights to Sam's soul thanks to a deal he made with Sam's parents before Sam was even born. Although he knows how it all ends (\\"God wins\\"), he is determined to do as much as he can to oppose God until the end. He also convinces Sam that he (Sam) is doing good by clearing the world of the escaped evil souls. Aside from Sam and Morgan, the Devil never appears before any of Sam's friends face-to-face despite the Devil knowing about them and aware that they know Sam's secret job of being a reaper for him. While firm at times, the Devil has never expressed outright anger, in spite of Sam's frequent complaints, incompetence, and meddling; however, when Sam cheated him out of a deal with another human, he caused all of the surrounding racks in the Work Bench to collapse on Sam out of \\"disappointment.\\" The Devil has nearly omnipotent supernatural powers, and often teleports an unsuspecting Sam to locations that serve to exemplify whatever subject he wishes to speak with Sam about. He also has a habit of providing Sam \\"motivation\\" in catching escaped souls, usually by informing him that someone just died (or is about to die) due mainly to Sam's inaction - a habit which generally gets acceptable results; this habit became less displayed in later episodes however, as Sam is beginning to \\"adjust\\" to his infernal fate. The Devil is nearly indestructible, and scoffs at the idea that he could be contained within a Solomon's cage (which can confine the strongest demon). He also has superhuman strength, having tricked and placed Sam once in a painful arm-hold to interrogate him. However, the Devil can be affected by angelic relics, as he can be killed by the Sword of the Archangel Michael (which he has in safekeeping), and could be \\"destroyed\\" if whole world were to turn to pacifism (as Sam deduced after the Devil's near-annihilation of a demon rebellion, as if the Devil couldn't tempt others with sin, he would cease to exist - although the Devil notes that all humanity adopting complete pacifism would be nearly impossible). In addition, the Devil cannot see, hear, or appear within curves or circles, although he can be summoned within a circle. He holds no influence over true love, which may be attributed to his belief that humans are incapable of experiencing it. The Devil also confesses that even though he tried to overthrow God, he still loved Him when Sam asked the Devil about love. He confesses to Sam that God loves us all no matter what we are. The Devil loves ice cream, but cannot eat it, as it melts as soon as he touches it. This doesn't happen on his own volition, but was apparently a curse given upon him by God shortly before he was cast out of Heaven, knowing how much he loves ice cream. It is later revealed that the devil opposes anthropogenic global warming as anyone who dies of it would be considered an innocent and not be sent to hell. The Devil is apparently Sam's father, according to the Devil throughout the second season. He does many things throughout the series that imply this: He never gets truly angry with Sam, he only gets outwardly angry with him one time where he says that he is \\"a disappointment.\\" He often offers guidance to Sam. He seems to have an extreme dislike of Sam's father. Throughout the series he and Sam do things that could be considered 'father-son activities' such as going to hockey games, eating ice cream, and playing baseball together. In \\"The Home Stretch\\" the Devil held a competition between Sam and his half-brother Morgan. Whoever captured a soul would be made his right-hand man. Sam wanted Morgan to win because his incompetence would thwart the Devil; he inadvertently won, however, while saving Morgan's life from the escaped soul. Supporting characters *Ted Gallagher (played by Donavon Stinson) - Ted was the Work Bench's pompous, imperious manager (and recovering gambling addict) who gave his employees, especially Sam, Andi, Ben, and Sock, a hard time. In episode 20 (\\"Dirty Sexy Mongol\\") Ted was fired from his job as manager at the Work Bench after sexually harassing a secret shopper sent from corporate. Corporate appointed Andi as the new store manager. She took pity on Ted and rehired him as a trainee for the Work Bench with Sock as his trainer. * Gladys (played by Christine Willes) - A demon who works at a DMV office, which actually houses a portal to Hell. Gladys collects the filled vessels from Sam and sends them back to Hell. In \\"The Leak,\\" when it was revealed that Gladys was the one repeatedly freeing home-wrecking soul Mike Volta from his vessel, the Devil \\"transferred\\" her to the \\"main office.\\" She was later released at Sam's request. *Josie Miller (played by Valarie Rae Miller) - Josie is Sock's ex- girlfriend who works at the district attorney's office. Despite her obvious dislike for Sock, Josie remains friendly with Sam and agrees to provide information that helps him track down different souls, unaware of his work for the Devil. However, after Sock used a share of stolen bank loot to buy duplicates of all the stuff lost in a fire at her apartment (which he inadvertently caused), she begins to suspect that something isn't quite on the \\"up-and-up\\" with the boys, and is even more suspicious and upset when her lost I.D. is used to access the city morgue. Toward the end of season one, Josie got back together (and subsequently broke up again) with Sock, due to his insecurity and his apathetic nature, respectively. Josie Miller only appeared in season one. * Nina (played by Jenny Wade) - A demon who tried to kill Sam, but her assassination attempt was thwarted by Ben. Enamored by his loyalty to his friend and love for his pet bunny, Nina kidnaps Ben and takes him to her lair. In \\"The Sweet Science\\", Nina is introduced to the group as Ben's girlfriend, but Ben remains concerned that Nina is not really interested in him and still trying to kill Sam. Nina reveals to Ben that she once had a physical relationship with a fellow demon named Brad in \\"The Favorite\\". When Ben tries to break up with Nina in a restaurant, she cries tears of acid. She tells how, while she was still an angel, she once fell in love with a human. After her relationship with the human was discovered by God, her human lover died shortly thereafter, explaining her reluctance to get more involved with Ben. In \\"The Home Stretch\\", Ben shows his reluctance to introduce Nina to his grandma who has 'the eye'. Nina strikes up a pleasant conversation with her about St. Peter but is shocked into her demon form, which sends Ben's grandma into cardiac arrest. Ben later breaks up with Nina at the Work Bench, and Nina declares a vendetta. However, at the end of \\"No Reaper left Behind\\" they get back together. * Tony (played by Ken Marino) - Sam's former neighbor, a demon and Steve's \\"widower\\". Tony was a leader of the anti-Devil rebellion, and was often plotting against the Devil. He helps Sam and his friends in their quest to capture escaped souls. As of the first season finale, his whereabouts are unknown. It is Tony who tells Sam that he is the son of the Devil. In the Second Season, he reappears and adopts the newborn daughter of an escaped soul, who he names 'Stevie' after his deceased husband Steve. * Mrs. Oliver (played by Allison Hossack) - Sam's guilt-ridden mother. Initially led to believe that Sam refused to do the Devil's work, she now accepts her son's fate, and actively supports him in his everyday life. According to the Devil, her soul is on the line if Sam should decide to quit his \\"job\\" as a Reaper. At the end of episode 18 (\\"Cancun\\"), she is seen digging up the very much alive Mr. Oliver, despite the fact that, when confronted by Sam about Mr. Oliver's burial, she claimed to be unaware of both the burial site and the fact that Mr. Oliver was still alive. * Kristen (played by Eriko Tamura) - Sock's new stepsister who adores Sock for being the older brother she's always wanted and wants to be involved in 'brother/sister' activities with him. These put no end to Sock's frustrations as he's extremely attracted to her and wishes to sleep with her. He eventually convinces her that they should sleep together and as this new incestuous relationships began to develop, their parents return home. She leaves to return to Japan in \\"The Good Soil\\" to continue her education at hotel school. * Morgan (played by Armie Hammer) - He is the son of The Devil and presumably Sam's paternal half brother. He first appears in \\"The Favorite\\", where Sam unwittingly bails him out of jail with his lottery winnings. He was arrested for stealing a limousine. He drives a silver Maserati, which was a gift from his ex, and tells Sam that he has no qualms in fighting Sam to the death for The Devil's righthand seat. Since The Devil feels that Morgan is unmotivated, he orders Sam to take Morgan on a reap in the hopes that Sam's good work ethics rub off. While Morgan is and always has been the Devil's favourite of the 2 sons so far introduced (Sam and Morgan) he is growing increasingly unsure of the situation, because while Morgan behaves as the Devil would like, he has little to no desire to work. By contrast Sam, though he regularly complains and defies the Devil, always \\"gets the job done.\\" In \\"The Good Soil,\\" he attempts to bribe Sam with money into capturing a soul and giving him the credit. He takes back his money after Sam turns in the dodgeball vessel with a corpse and later in the episode captures the soul with the vessel. In \\"The Home Stretch\\", The Devil challenges Sam and Morgan to a contest, in which whoever returned the soul back to Hell would become his right-hand man. When Sam accidentally wins the contest, The Devil takes everything from Morgan, and he swears revenge against Sam. * Alan Townsend (played by Sean Patrick Thomas) - The man who reneged on his deal with the Devil. Sam meets Alan first in the Season 2 premiere, \\"A New Hope,\\" during a reap to capture 40 fighting souls in a warehouse. After being knocked unconscious from Alan, Sam continues his hunt for him in \\"Dirty Sexy Mongol\\" and tracks him down to an apartment. He tries to solicit Alan's help, but two demons, sent by The Devil, attack Sam at the gate. Scared that he'll return to Hell, Alan leaves his apartment. Sam and Andi find out that Alan's been trying to stay off The Devil's radar by avoiding all temptation. Alan accepts a job offer as a gravedigger and takes refuge at a cemetery after being informed that the grounds have been consecrated and thus untouchable by the Devil and other demons. Sam and the others corner him at the cemetery and, since Alan was a gambling addict, attempt to bribe him with horse-racing tickets for the information. Alan eventually buys into a trip to Vatican City and tells Sam that he needs to challenge and beat The Devil (Alan beat The Devil in a game of poker). He promises to tell Sam how to make The Devil agree to the challenge after landing. As he is on a plane toward Vatican City, the Devil sends the plane to Las Vegas and gave him 100 dollars in casino chips, Later the Devil tells Sam that he took Alan back to hell after he started gambling (which is a sin, and Alan's deal with the devil was that if he sinned again he would return to hell). * Steve (played by Michael Ian Black) - A deceased former neighbor of Sam, also a demon, and Tony's \\"ex\\"-husband. Prior to his death, Steve was an active part of the rebellion against the Devil. He chose the more passive path of rebellion over Tony's aggressive route, but still stood by him regardless. It is revealed in the first season finale that Steve is still \\"alive\\", and is now an angel (again). * Cady Hansen (played by Jessica Stroup) - Sam's ex-girlfriend, and possible daughter of the Devil. Cady is the daughter of Mimi, the Devil's ex-girlfriend, but her true father is unknown. Although Sam is initially attracted to her, he suspects that she may be the Devil's daughter (a suspicion seemingly put to rest by Sock and Ben in \\"Cash Out\\"). Despite his general calm to the situation, Sam's suspicions re-surface later on, due to her reportedly strange behavior around Andi and the manifestation of strange phenomena around her, such as breaking glass spurred by a kiss, and flowers wilting and dying several moments after she has touched them. At the end of \\"Unseen\\", Cady, upset by the fact that Sam still has been distant and in her eyes deceitful, goes to New Mexico to stay with her mother and sort things out. If the Devil truly was her biological father as well as Sam's, that would technically make them paternal half-siblings. Minor characters * Kyle Oliver (played by Kyle Switzer) - Sam's younger brother. Much pressure has been put on him by his parents to be successful in life, which he considers unfair compared to them letting Sam slide. Kyle is the one member of the family unaware of Sam's debt to the Devil, and does not realize how lucky he was to be born second. He has only appeared in the pilot episode and \\"Charged\\" to date. Because of the Second season's premier, Kyle is now technically Sam's maternal half-brother. * Judy Wysocki (played by Marilyn Norry) - Sock's mom. She went unseen until \\"Hungry for Fame,\\" when she returned from Las Vegas and announced she had married an Asian cowboy named Morris. Angry that his mother had married without his blessing, Sock ran away from home; when he finally returned, his mother kicked him out of the house, prompting him, Sam, and Ben to move in together. * Greg (played by Colby Johannson) - Andi's college boyfriend. He initially comes across as caring and sympathetic toward her needs, but it becomes clear that he knows very little about her and is more concerned about himself and his feelings. Greg and Sam end up fighting in \\"The Cop\\", and Andi breaks up with him. Broken-hearted, Greg sold his soul to the Devil, and returned (in \\"Greg, Shmeg\\") with a newfound influence over Andi. Unfortunately, as a result of his deal with the Devil, his id began physically manifesting itself as a chainsaw-wielding maniac that materializes from his body every time he got angry. Greg eventually realized that no matter what deal he made, Andi would never love him, as the Devil cannot influence true love. Sam used his \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card to undo Greg's deal. * Sara (played by Lucy Davis) - Ben's ex-wife, a British national formerly employed at the Work Bench. In \\"Coming to Grips,\\" after Ben gives up on finding his perfect girl, he agrees to a green card wedding with Sara in exchange for $1600. Ben eventually meets his perfect girl, Cassidy, later on while chasing a soul, but Sara expects him to live up to their deal and refuses to let him go out with Cassidy. When Ben threatens to report her to immigration, Sara counters by threatening to report him for extorting money from her. Ben considers just giving her the money back, until he discovers that Sock spent it on tickets to the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. In addition to being married to Ben, Sara is also involved with a married Cirque du Soleil performer named Esteban. When Sara reveals she's pregnant with Esteban's child, Ben has the bargaining chip he needs, and Sara eventually lets him date Cassidy. After an immigration officer discovers their ruse, Sara convinces Ben to give her $2000 to help bribe the officer; in actuality, she takes the money and goes on the lam. * Cassidy (played by Kandyse McClure) - Ben's ex-girlfriend. She is a nurse at St. Vincent's Hospital who practices jiujitsu and enjoys Sue Grafton novels. Cassidy and Ben met in the maternity ward of St. Vincent's in \\"Coming to Grips\\" when Ben was pursuing prolific soul Jack King. After a string of dates in the hospital cafeteria, Cassidy began to ask questions, specifically about Ben's wedding ring; it was at that point that Ben came clean about his green card marriage to Sara. The three of them came to an understanding, although Cassidy would still get a little excited about being Ben's \\"mistress.\\" When Immigration busted Ben and Sara, Cassidy was the one who took Ben to jail, excited at the prospect that he would be single again when he got out. In \\"The Sweet Science\\", Ben explains to Nina that Cassidy ditched him while he was still in jail. Sam's Powers For every soul that Sam is forced to catch, the Devil gives him a special power to help him catch it, or give a hint for what he can do to stop it. These powers can range from psychic control, to growing tattoos that hint where the soul will be. It also seems that Sam can activate the powers any time, as seen in \\"The Underbelly,\\" when through only anger, Sam can break the wine bottle without touching it. Not all of these powers affect his body. In \\"Love, Bullet, and Blacktop,\\" all that happens is the song Radar Love by Golden Earring keeps playing. Demons Demons, in the Reaper universe, are portrayed as seemingly neutral and non-aggressive (so far) entities who are either in the direct service of the Devil or plotting to overthrow his rule. It was stated that all demons were once angels who \\"fell\\" out of their place after joining up with the Devil's attempt to overthrow God and got banished along with him from Heaven. Demons residing within the mortal realm exhibit the ability to assume near-human forms that enable them to live along with real humans, with the only thing distinguishing them from actual mortals (besides their immortality) being two small horns protruding from their foreheads which can be sanded down to create the complete illusion that they are human; they are also capable of morphing into their true demonic forms, as displayed by Tony, which seem to grant an incredible boost of physical power in the process, and flight to those with wings. They are immune to mortal weapons in either form. Types of Demons include standard demons and succubi. Reapers 'Reapers' are beings tasked by the Devil to apprehend souls that have escaped the depths of Hell. Sam became one in the premiere episode of the series. The word was first used in the episode \\"Acid Queen\\", which implies that there may be others like him with a similar obligation (or predicament). Currently, it is not exactly known how many Reapers there are, or if all of them are even human. Sam does not like this status but begins to live with this fate, though shows no surprise towards its utterance. It is made clear by the demon Steve that Sam is perhaps the only person on Earth that the Devil talks with face-to-face, which raises suspicion amongst Sam and his friends. This suggestion is later disproved when the Devil introduces Morgan, a young man the Devil claims is his son. Escaped souls These are fugitives from Hell whom the Devil has entrusted Sam to recapture. All of them were once mortals who committed various crimes or sold their souls that ultimately led to their damnation. When they come back to Earth, they are intent on finishing the jobs that they started. After escaping Hell and returning to the earthly realm, not only do they regain a corporeal body with which to interact with the living world once again, but they also exhibit supernatural powers that often reflect the nature of their crimes or punishments. For example, an arsonist imprisoned in Hell for 50 years being tortured by being burnt everyday came back with pyrokinetic powers and could take on the appearance of a humanoid creature made of molten rock. Leon Czolgosz, the assassin of William McKinley, gained the ability to turn his hands into guns. Not all souls come back to Earth with a corporeal body, as seen in \\"Ashes to Ashes,\\" where the soul came back as a spirit since his body was destroyed. Vessels As the souls that Sam is sent to apprehend have already died once (along with the fact that they have various paranormal abilities), an attempt to capture or even kill them by a mere mortal could prove almost impossible. The Devil provides Sam with vessels to help him do his work. The vessel is usually sent for Sam to open in a wooden box which varies in shape per episode, sometimes inappropriate for the vessel they hold (i.e. a large box contained a Zippo lighter vessel) and it's usually up to Sam to figure out how to use it to capture the escaped soul assigned for him to apprehend since the vessels don't usually come with an instruction manual. All vessels are unique because each of them is intended to capture the escaped soul for whom they were created and intended to confine. The vessel could even be a living thing (e.g. a live dove). Vessels often have the appearance of seemingly ordinary day-to-day accessories, and can easily be mistaken for such. Most escaped souls shown in the series seem to be aware whenever a vessel is brought to their presence, especially if that particular vessel is the one intended for their capture, thus alerting them of potentially being sent back to Hell by the one wielding the vessel. In \\"The Good Soil\\", it is revealed that vessels can capture other objects besides souls (e.g. a corpse). The Ender Introduced in \\"The Good Soil\\", The Ender is The Devil's backup plan. When Sam refused to capture the soul and return it to Hell, The Ender was summoned to seek out and destroy the soul. As a result, the soul would neither be sent to Heaven or Hell. The Ender took on a form of a cloaked phantom and can destroy anything with one touch. It is unclear as to whether or not The Ender is real, or was simply an elaborate ruse set up by The Devil to trick Sam into believing the soul was safe so that Morgan could capture it.

It was designated as a Grade I listed building on 29 March 1963. The farm now offers bed and breakfast accommodation and is a wedding venue. Building The farmhouse was originally built for Thomas Tremayll as a manor house, with integrated chapel, in approximately 1480. During the 16th century a porch was added, as well as a service wing. The interior was altered in the 19th century, adding windows to the rear of the property at the same time. The two story farmhouse is made of red sandstone rubble, with roughly cut quoins and rubble chimneystacks. The roof is slate ending in coped verges. The front of the building has a number of bays ending in the chapel wing to the north, which includes tall lancet arch windows as well as an ogee-headed moulded stone door frame. The main entrance to the house is in one of the bays, with a studded door, in a similar ogee-headed moulded stone door frame. On the south side of the house there is a garderobe, also two storeys high, with a turret to the rear. The building has many architectural features of its period with the roof structure comprising a series of jointed crucks together with some curved wind-braces still in place. There are coffered ceilings and a plank and muntin screen with soot blackening to one side now in one of the upstairs rooms (possibly re- sited from being a screens passage at the entrance to the main hall where one would expect to see this type of structure).

It is located west-northwest of Redway, at an elevation of . History A post office operated at Ettersburg from 1902 to 1906 and from 1915 to 1965. The name comes from the ancestral home of homesteader Albert F. Etter. =Development of Ettersburg= Albert's German-born mother, Wilhelmina (Kern) Etter (d. 1913) was skilled at cultivating plants, and Etter showed a talent for hybridizing plants in childhood, working with apples, peaches, dahlias, and strawberries by the time he was twelve. He attended public school and by the end of his teens was looking out for a site where he could continue his plant-breeding experiments. On a fishing trip to the Mattole River Valley, he found a section of land above Bear Creek and in 1894 he staked a claim to it. This area along the Pacific coast in the King Range has wet winters and hot summers, and Etter later attributed his success partly to his choice of location. The site where Albert developed his ranch was subsequently named after him, first as Etter and then as Ettersburg. Etter managed the ranch with three of his brothers, George, Fred, and August; and another four of his siblings also lived nearby. While Etter focused on plant breeding, his brothers oversaw other kinds of farming and stockkeeping operations. The ranch holdings, operated under the business name Etter Brothers, eventually reached 800 acres in size. Although the Etter Brothers firm and the Ettersburg Experimental Place became internationally known among plant breeders, and Etter renowned as \\"the Luther Burbank of Humboldt County\\", they never made more than a modest living from the land. For one thing, they were far removed from the main trucking and rail routes, and for another, new plant hybrids were not protected by the patent system until 1930. Geography Ettersburg is located west-northwest of Redway at an elevation of . Nearby cities are: Shelter Cove (17.8 miles south-southwest), Garberville (19.2 miles east/southeast) Benbow, (22.4 miles ESE), Weott (27 miles NNE), Redcrest (33.7 miles N), Alderpoint (35.7 miles E). According to the USGS Site Map, the city has a drainage area . Ettersburg is in the Lost Coast region which includes Pacific Ocean coast, and several rivers. The location of Ettersburg on U.S. 101 is northwest of Sacramento and north of San Francisco. The next big city is Eureka, principal city and county seat of Humboldt County. The city is only away with access the coast and increases in elevation slightly as it spreads north, south, and especially to the east. The city then gives way to hills and mountains of the rugged coast range, which quickly exceed in elevation. Climate Ettersburg experiences mild to warm (but not hot) and dry summers with some rainy days, with not many average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Ettersburg has a cold- summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csc\\" on climate maps. There are cool winters during which intense rainfall occurs. It has warm, dry summers with moderate rainfall through the summer months. Snow in Ettersburg is very rare, occurring every 20–30 years in winter months. Average January temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . Average August temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . The record high temperature was . The record low temperature was . Average annual precipitation is . There are on average 120 days with measurable precipitation which makes Ettersburg a Mediterranean climate. Ettersburg's Köppen classification and climate is similar to locations such as parts of Balmaceda, Chile, in high elevations of Corsica, Haleakala Summit in Hawaii and the Cascades or Sierra-Nevada-ranges. Education Ettersburg once had an Elementary school from 1980 to 2012 serving 3 Grades. The next school district is either in Shelter Cove, Whitehorn or in Garberville.

Early years (1927-1949)  Professor Harald Christian Pederson founded the A/S Ila and Lilleby smelteverk melting facilities in the 1920s. He worked with a chemical process which later has been called the Pederson-2 process. It consists of melting ironmalm which gives ferrosilicon as a by-product.  Occupation years (1940-1945)  Lilleby closed on the same day Norway was attacked by Nazi Germany, but it did not remain closed for long. The Norwegian aluminium industry was of great strategic importance for the German government, which requested that Lilleby resume operation right away. Birger Solberg was placed in charge, because professor Pedersen had left with his family to Sweden. Solberg was dismissed the day that Pederson returned, undoubtedly related to his views on the occupation, which differed from Professor Pedersen's views: Pedersen was a supporter of Nazi Germany and wanted to collaborate with the occupation. During the war, the plant was geared mostly towards aluminium, which was more important for the German war effort; however, many employees sabotaged the work in order to keep productivity low. 180px  Post-World War II  After the war, Birger Solberg resumed control, but the economics and equipment of the facility had become unfavorable.

The game has game play similar to rock paper scissors, except with ships Gameplay The gameplay is very similar to chess, but with a much larger map, a wider variety of units, and a greater level of detail. Combat uses a rock/paper/scissors system to determine outcomes. There are three phases of play during a turn: the navigation map, the battle map, and the end of turn overview. Ships on the navigation map can be identified by its corresponding image or hull classification symbol =Battleship= Battleships are robust vessels used for aggressively attacking the enemy. They have 12 hit points and can deal up to 6 points of damage. They are extremely vulnerable to submarine attacks. Their heavy armor makes machinegun fire ineffective against battleships. =Carrier= Carriers are defensively weak fleet vessels with 7 hit points. They have 2 attack strength but all vessels nearby get an extra attack point due to fleet airplanes. The planes on board appear to be Douglas TBD Devastators. Carriers are extremely vulnerable to all vessels but the passive damage buff for nearby vessels and their extended sight range makes the carrier an essential element of any fleet. =Cruiser= Cruisers are like small versions of battleships. With eight hit points they have less firepower than battleships but come equipped with a depth charge launcher to repel submarine assaults. They can deal two points of damage towards submerged submarines. =Destroyer= Destroyers are fast multipurpose vessels used to harass enemy transports and disrupt sea routes. They have six hit points. They are most effective against submerged submarines with their multi-depth charge launcher which deals six hit points of damage to submerged submarines. =Submarine= Submarines in Lost Admiral Returns are modeled after German U-Boats. They have six hit points which makes them very vulnerable to a destroyer's depth charge attack. Because of this a suggested tactic is to surface the sub. When surfaced, the destroyer's guns deal four points of damage, giving the sub a chance to escape. During battle phase, the submarine fires three torpedoes against enemy ships. There is no ammunition limit for submarines. =Patrol Boat= Patrol boats are light and fast boats used for reconnaissance and transport raid. They deal only one point of damage, which is enough to sink a transport ship in one turn, but not enough to engage in a duel with an armored transport ship. They are armed with machineguns and are boosted greatly by the presence of a carrier. * Armored Transport * Transport * Flagships See also * Hull classification symbol * Fogstone ReferencesExternal links * Fogstone main site * Lost Admiral main site Category:1991 video games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ","title":"Lost Admiral Returns"},{"id":"22803647","text":"WLIJ (1580 AM) is a radio station broadcasting an Americana/Bluegrass format, licensed to Shelbyville, Tennessee.

Biography Born and raised in Stevensville, Montana, Tyler Bradt was first introduced to kayaking at only six years of age by his father, Bill Bradt. Tyler's skills seemed to be above average as he kayaked class five rapids only six years later at the age of twelve. By age fifteen, he was a kayaking prodigy, receiving national recognition for his abilities. In July 2001, Tyler was invited to kayak rapids in Norway. While on this trip, Tyler had a near death experience when he was flipped and pinned up against a rock under the force of the water. To this day he still calls it \\"the closest call he's ever had\\". Tyler has appeared in several films. He has gone on kayaking expeditions and holds the record for the highest waterfall kayaked at 189 ft. World Record at Palouse Falls On April 21, 2009, Bradt successfully kayaked Palouse Falls in Washington state. At an estimated (This drop was re-measured at 189 ft.), this made Bradt's descent a world record, breaking the previous record set by a Brazilian kayaker named Pedro Oliva who ran the Salto Belo of the Rio Sacre just a month before. In turn, Oliva's descent of Salto Belo broke Bradt's previous record of from 2007 over Alexandra Falls on the Hay River in the Northwest Territories. Bradt's plunge attracted media attention since the Palouse Falls are taller than Niagara Falls. His media agent sold both pictures and video of Bradt's descent to Sports Illustrated. On May 18, 2009, the first published photos appeared in the magazine along with video footage on SI's website. Bradt and kayaker/film maker/friend Rush Sturges used footage of the plunge in their 2010 collaborative film, Dream Result. Injury at Abiqua In March 2011, Tyler was on his Huck Fest Tour, which is an annual tour that he and his friends go on looking for big waterfalls. On this trip, they found Abiqua Falls, a 95 ft. waterfall located in Oregon in which Tyler made a mistake and went into the water too flat, causing him to break the L1 vertebra in his back. It took Tyler's friends, including Aaron Rettig who was with him that day, four hours to carry him out of the canyon to a nearby hospital. Once there, Tyler underwent a four-hour surgery by Dr. Joseph Sherrill, getting four screws and a bone graft to replace crushed bone. Tyler wasn't cleared to kayak by doctors for three months following the injury. Expeditions After Bradt healed from a back injury he planned an expedition to the Gulf of California in Baja California, Mexico, accompanied by Sarah McNair-Landry and his friend Erik Boomer. The plan was for the trip to be a 450-mile journey over a span of 30 to 45 days. The group set off as scheduled from Kino Nuevo on January 21, 2012, but a couple of days into the trip, nasty weather held them up on shore for seven days. They were forced to cut the trip short because Sarah had to catch a plane and fly north for an arctic expedition training camp she had to teach. The group decided their new destination would be Loreto, Mexico, 258 miles from their starting point. On February 14, 2012, 24 days after they started and two days before Sarah's flight took off, they made it.

It is located on Humboldt Bay south-southwest of downtown Eureka, at an elevation of 13 feet (4 m). The ZIP Code is 95537.USPS ZIP Code lookup tool The population was 276 at the 2010 census. History Before the arrival of European settlers, the area now known as Humboldt County was occupied by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Wiyot, Yurok, Hupa, Karuk, Chilula, Whilkut, and the southern Athabascans. Fields Landing is located within the original territory of the Wiyot tribe.Northwestern Fisheries Service of the NOAA The first recorded entrance into Humboldt Bay occurred in 1806 by members of a Russian-American company from Sitka. The Josiah Gregg party arrived by land in December 1849, and by 1850 the first ships came to the bay bringing men seeking gold. As the Gold Rush subsided, the economy shifted to the use of the surrounding natural resources, mainly timber, salmon, and agricultural land. The area was a prime exporter of agricultural products from 1857 to 1900. Fields Landing was named for Waterman Field, a resident of Humboldt County since 1861. He established the town in 1862. Field owned 160 acres in what is currently known as Fields Landing. Waterman Field built a dock there to ship his farm products and the name \\"Fields Landing\\" was derived from this landing place for ships. Fort Humboldt was built in 1853 to protect settlers from retaliatory attacks and keep peace between the settlers and the natives was a failure, as the garrison did neither successfully. Indians were enslaved under the terms of the 1850 \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians\\" that provided legal basis for the continued Californio practice of capturing and using Native people as forced workers, particularly that of young women and children, which was carried on as a legal business enterprise. Compiled laws of the State of California: containing all the acts of the Legislature of a public and general nature, now in force, passed at the sessions of 1850-51-52-53, Benicia, S. Garfeilde, 1853. pp. 822-825 An Act for the Government and Protection of Indians Intrusion of professional hunters and settlers and their herds of cattle and pigs into the hunting and gathering areas of the natives in the interior led the reduction of their food supplies and native resistance to this began the Bald Hills War. Development around the bay, disease, and the February 26, 1860 Indian Island Massacre, and consequences of the Bald Hills War, led to decimation of the peaceful Wiyot reducing their numbers from 3,000 to less than 100 survivors by 1865.Heizer, Robert F. The destruction of California Indians. Lincoln and London: Univ. of Nebraska Press, (1974). In the 1880s, docks were built in Fields Landing for shipping redwood and other timber. When the Northwestern Pacific Railroad was extended into the Humboldt Bay area in 1914, it functioned as a dike, and allowed the tidal marshes to be converted into agricultural lands. The construction of U.S. Route 101 in 1927 also created more fill, allowing most of the marshes to be drained and diked. After World War II, a new Douglas fir and plywood industry brought in many out-of-state loggers and mill workers. From 1940 to 1951, a whaling station operated in Fields Landing. However, the timber industry continued to dominate life in the community into the 1970s. The demise of the timber industry in the 1980s forced a fresh perspective on resource use.

Life  Neumark was born in Langensalza, the son of Michael Neumark and his wife Martha. From 1630 he attended the gymnasium in Schleusingen and later transferred to that of Gotha. In 1640 he began law studies at the University of Königsberg. Fleeing the tumult of war he took a position as tutor in Kiel. In 1643 he was able to return to Königsberg, where he devoted himself more and more to music, in which he was greatly supported by Simon Dach. After graduating in law Neumark went first to Danzig and in 1649 to Thorn. Two years later, in 1651, he returned to his native Thuringia. There his uncle, councilor Plattner, introduced him to the duke Wilhelm IV of Saxe-Weimar, who appointed him Kanzleiregistrator and in 1652 librarian. In the following year the duke brought Neumark into the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft. He received the nickname der Sprossende (the sprouting) and the motto Nützlich und ergetzlich (useful and delightful), as well as the emblem Schwarzbraune gefüllte Nelken (dark-brown carnation). In 1656 he was elected Erzschreinhalter der Fruchtbringenden Gesellschaft (guardian of the shrine). His famous hymn Wer nur den lieben Gott läßt walten appeared in 1641. The Pegnesische Blumenorden (a poet's society in Nürnberg named after the river Pegnitz) accepted Neumark as a member in 1679. He carried on an extensive but not untroubled correspondence with the society's president, Sigmund von Birken, who acted as his literary agent. On 8 July 1681, Neumark died at the age of 60 in Weimar, where he was interred in the Jacobsfriedhof. The Evangelical Church marks his memorial on 9 July.

The Osprey was of conventional wood and fabric construction, with single-bay triplane wings. It was powered by a Bentley BR2 rotary engine, and featured the required armament of two Vickers machine guns and a single Lewis gun. The synchronised Vickers guns were mounted ahead of the pilot, while the Lewis gun was mounted on a movable mounting on the centre section of the middle wing, where it had a very limited field of fire, with the large diameter propeller blocking any forward fire.Bruce 1965, p.27. Like a similar gun mounted on the Snipe it would probably have been deleted had the type gone into production. The first Osprey flew in February 1918,Bruce 1965, p.28. being tested at Martlesham Heath in March. It was heavier than expected, and its performance was inferior to Sopwith's Snipe. When the Snipe was selected as the winner of the competition for the new fighter, Austin abandoned development of the Osprey, with the second and third prototypes not completed.Mason 1992, p.273. The first prototype was briefly used for trials at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough until at least June 1918.Bruce 1965, p.29. Specifications See alsoNotesReferences *Bruce, J.M.

Wind & Stars Production Group is the bannerhead under which she produces. Her contributions to over 25 PBS productions have taken her all over the world. Vietnam Passage: Journeys from War to Peace, a trilogy on post war Vietnam, premiered on PBS, and won national recognition. Early work Making movies has taken Northrop all over the world. Among her many assignments was working for the National Geographic Society in Africa as location manager and editor on two acclaimed television specials. Last Stand in Eden covered the plight of endangered elephants in Kenya. Gorillas, explored Rwanda's mountain gorillas. Current projects Northrop is also a recognized authority on American editorial cartoons. In 1996 she co-authored Drawn & Quartered, with Steven Hess on the history of American editorial cartoons and their impact on political and popular culture. The book grew out of two NEH grants. An updated version of the book will be published in Summer, 2009. She combined her love of filmmaking and political cartoons to produce two segments for The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer on the 2004 presidential race as seen by the cartoonists. Northrop followed The Economist's Kevin Kallaugher who was making the transition for two-dimensional to three dimensional caricatures. The resulting film, The World According to Kal, was featured in Mightier Than the Sword: The Satirical Pen of Kal, at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore the summer of 2006. Northrop also curated a retrospective on United States Presidential Elections, 1796–2008, as covered by editorial cartoonists, for the Newseum in 2007. Work in Vietnam In 1997 Northrop moved to Hanoi, Vietnam. While there she produced, directed, shot and edited Vietnam Passage: Journeys from War to Peace, a trilogy of three one-hour television specials on post war Vietnam. These programs which premiered on PBS offer an intimate view of the changes that have taken Vietnam forward from the ashes of a devastating war to the opportunities for peace. Assignment Hanoi, the first program, told the story of Pete Peterson, who having survived six years as a POW in the “Hanoi Hilton” during the war and was returning to Vietnam as the United States' first Ambassador since 1975. The second program, Vietnam Passage: Journeys from War to Peace highlighted the Vietnamese perspective on the “American” War and its aftermath. The Next Generation, the final program in the trilogy, focused on eight Vietnamese kids, born during or just after the war and their hopes for the future. The Library of Congress recently selected Next Generation for its permanent collection. Other production Northrop spent eight years producing the historical montages that have become the signature for PBS's National Memorial Day and A Capitol Fourth live concert celebrations. Education Northrop graduated from Stanford University's Masters documentary program in 1972. She received a BFA in photography from the University of Michigan in 1969.

The group was organized on February 14, 1892, when members of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, under the leadership of Joseph B. Lynch, became convinced that they could not be saved without experiencing the \\"second blessing,\\" i.e. entire sanctification. Christ's Sanctified Holy Church grew significantly during the first part of the 20th century as members traveled across the country preaching the doctrines of holiness and sanctification. At its early stages the movement was known as the Sanctified Band, Sanctification Band, or Lynchites. History Christ's Sanctified Holy Church has its roots in Methodism and in the Holiness Movement illustrated, in part, by minutes of a convention on entire sanctification from 1841 and the preaching of George Watson, who also originated from the Eastern Shore. In 1887 on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, a group of people was convinced that they, though living in a state of forgiveness before God, could not be saved without sanctification. Through reading the Bible and through prayer, they sought and obtained this second blessing of sanctification. They started to proclaim this message to others in their church and community. In 1892, after their petition to the Methodist Episcopal Church requesting a holy minister was rejected, they organized themselves into Christ’s Sanctified Holy Church. Joseph B. Lynch, their earliest leader, was “the first person on the Eastern shore of Virginia to embrace the Holiness doctrines that so divided American Methodism at the end of the 19th century” and Christ’s Sanctified Holy Church is the “oldest Holiness congregation on the Virginia peninsula”. There was no way the Chincoteague residents of the day could have known it, but Lynch “and his followers were not unique in their beliefs and practices” as Holiness revivals begin in the United States in the last half of the nineteenth century. The message of Holiness was strong, convicting, and forced a decision in those that heard the doctrine. It seems those outside of the community were more than ready to believe scandalous accusations. Where the community preached that sanctification would remove the desire for sinful acts, some observers took that to mean that acts that would normally be sinful are not sinful to the sanctified. A former member of the movement was killed by local vigilantes from a ‘stray bullet’. Those who committed that act never paid for that crime as the community came to their defense, but, later, leaders of the band, Lynch, Collins, and two other men were arrested for free love offenses, and jailed and fined by the authorities. According to Rev. Kirk Mariner, a retired United Methodist minister, writer and historian, their “crime being by today’s standard, nothing more than the practice and promotion of religious beliefs that run counter to the current community standards”. Today the church “enjoys peace and acceptance among the islanders and its members, like those of the sect in general, are now held in respect throughout the community”. The belief that compelled the split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, sometimes affected families and the community. Undoubtedly there were occasions where a husband or wife wanted to join the Sanctified Band, becoming a traveling evangelist and the other didn’t. Indeed, they moved frequently, seeking fertile fields for the preaching, avoiding persecution, and trying to make a financial living. Some family separations likely resulted from decisions to move with them, perhaps others were of personal convenience and contrary to the teachings of the community. Some of the earliest Doctrine and Discipline documents from 1897 state that “No brother or sister shall leave his wife or her husband except it be for fornication and adultery”. Nevertheless, there were examples where a husband or wife left along with the Sanctified band from the original founding through the evangelical period. 503x503px Even amid the persecution, many recognized the sincerity. In the summer of 1894, a writer from the New York Recorder heard about the group that was preaching that a person could live a life free from sin and be holy. The writer was convinced they were “perfectly sincere” “Every face bore the stamp of perfect contentment with a full-souled peace and spiritual happiness that shined in their faces”. 414x414px Seeking those receptive to their message and fleeing the persecution, the group migrated from Chincoteague drawing attention for its unusual practices of living in houseboats. Through their evangelistic efforts, their message immediately spread to neighboring communities on the eastern shore of Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland. Others believed and were sanctified. The traveling band was generally becoming well received in many communities, but did face numerous challenges. In 1895, a group of people from Christ's Sanctified Holy Church left the eastern shore of Virginia and Delaware to begin an evangelistic effort to spread the message of sanctification. In February 1897 a local newspaper in Oregon, NC published an interesting account. “They held many meetings – almost daily…. Some 150 persons have professed a belief in their doctrines of sanctification.” “Whilst many good men are opposing them, very many of the best citizens in the section where they have chiefly operated say they have done a great good”. An approximately 60 year old experienced-local minister from a larger denomination challenged them to a joint debate on scripture subjects on Tuesday January 20, 1897. Mrs. Sarah E. Collins, a 26 year old co-leader was reported to be “thoroughly posted as to the doctrines she advocates and seems to know the entire Bible by heart”. The report continues that “space will not allow us to give a report of the discussions, but we feel warranted in saying that Reverend Davenport will not want to renew the discussions, and that at least nine out of 10 who heard the debate would give the victory to the woman”. Perhaps events were embellished with international coverage, as a paper in New Zealand carried a story repeated by the Oxford Observer The paper reports that fleeing persecution in Chowan County North Carolina, they loaded onto their houseboats and moved them about 50 yards out into the water. Some time later, with bullets ripping through the sides of their houseboats they started singing. “Raucous cries, curses and threats were heard from the river bank”, but from the Sanctified houseboats only “a wail of prayer and weeping” as Patty Watkins lost her life to a bullet. The paper goes on to report “Yet not a word was said in bitterness against those who had killed her”. Though blogs are posted online as recently as 2012, a more thorough treatment of the context and historical events appears in these references. Some examples provide insight into Christ’s Sanctified Holy Church. From the beginning it was asserted that there would be no salaries for ministers of the church; there would be no money raising methods, collections or festivals in the church. They teach that everyone (both men and women) who was sanctified had the freedom to preach, testify and sing as the Spirit moved on them (though leaders often stopped anyone talking over 15 minutes). They stand in a group, singing, clapping hands and shouting as the Spirit moves on them with no musical instruments. During World War I, the church encouraged its members to seek jobs in the shipyards to avoid conscription, as their beliefs prohibited military service. Their initial travels extended from Maryland to North Carolina and by the end of the decade, to South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Others were sanctified and joined in the evangelistic efforts. By 1905, meetings were held in cities of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and the western states of Colorado and California. Others were sanctified and joined in the evangelistic efforts. By 1905, meetings were held in cities of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and the western states of Colorado and California. As the church grew, other groups formed and carried on the evangelistic efforts to many other places in the United States. These travels continued on a broad scale for the first half of the twentieth century. After that time, permanent churches were established by the believers in all of the states of the southeastern United States. Christ's Sanctified Holy Church Camp Ground Church In the summer of 1938 efforts begin to establish a Camp ground where the traveling Sanctified bands could meet once a year to spend a week or two together and where older members could retire. Today that Campground exists near Perry, GA centered around an updated sanctuary dedicated in 2004. Annual Camp meetings are held there starting the Saturday night before the 3rd Sunday in July. Rather than traveling bands convening there, today most of the faithful come there from active churches established in Leesburg/Albany, GA; Between/Atlanta, GA; Perry, GA (location of the campground), Columbia County / Augusta, GA; Hanahan/Charleston, SC; Columbia, SC; Jacksonville, FL; Jemison, AL; Terry, MS; Raleigh, NC; Wilmington, NC; Greensboro, NC; Old Trap, NC; Belvidere, NC; Piney Woods, NC; Chesapeake, VA; Chincoteague, VA; Houma, LA, and Omar, DE. Beliefs The church teaches that salvation is a two-step process consisting of conversion (repentance and forgiveness of sins) and sanctification (the indwelling of the Holy Spirit) which cleanses the believer from all sin. Believers are then expected to live clean, holy lives. Other doctrines include the inspiration of the Scriptures, the deity of Christ, and the existence of a literal heaven and hell. It is the practice of the CSHC to use the King James Version of the Bible. Singing is a cappella, with spontaneous preaching and prayer. The church is firmly within the Wesleyan- Arminian tradition. Salvation is considered an act of free will on the part of the believer.CSHC official website Women may preach and teach in the assembly. It does not pass around a collection plate, or ask for offerings during a church service. In addition, no clergy position or ministry worker is ever given monetary compensation for their work, as this work is assumed to be voluntary and without pay. The church was a product of the \\"anti-ordinance\\" controversy that arose within the holiness movement during the 1890s. Lynch and others believed that the traditional ordinances of the church – namely, water baptism, Communion, and footwashing – were no longer necessary for believers. The church takes literally the words in Ephesians 4:5, \\"One Lord, one faith, one baptism\\", believing the \\"one baptism\\" for believers to be the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The doctrine of physical resurrection of the dead was also rejected in favor of a spiritual resurrection taking place at sanctification. This places the church within the Preterist fold eschatologically. Present activities The church maintains a cemetery and campground in Perry, Georgia, and hosts an annual camp meeting during the month of July. The church also operates a home for the elderly. Membership today is largely confined to seventeen congregations located in Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Related movements In the late 1800s members of the movement fled Chincoteague after violent attacks due to their heterodox beliefs. In 1904 several members of the movement arrived in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, and worked with African American Methodists there. This inspired the 1904 formation of the Christ's Sanctified Holy Church Colored. The group later dropped the \\"Colored\\" from their name, but maintained a separate existence from the main CSHC body. Today it is called Christ Holy Sanctified Church and headquartered in Texas.

Its primary purpose was to present works of art created by artists of conscience through exhibitions of contemporary art, world music concerts, performances and panel discussions. Art works that focused on social and political issues were given primary consideration for presentation.  History  The Alternative Museum was founded in December, 1975. It closed its doors in April, 2000. It was at a number of locations in New York: * First location: 28 East 4th Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10003. * Second location: 17 White Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10013. * Final location: 594 Broadway, N.Y., N.Y. 10012. Its motto was: Ahead of the times and behind the issues. The museum's founders were: Geno Rodriguez (AKA Eugene Rodriguez), Janice Rooney, and Robert Browning.  Rationale  The Alternative Museum opened its doors in 1975 with an exhibition of 10 Japanese artists living in New York City. Founded and operated by artist Geno Rodriguez, Janice Rooney and Robert Browning, The Alternative Museum's primary functions were to provide a professional showcase for artists, leadership with an \\"artist\\" perspective within The Alternative Museum profession, and an atmosphere where ideas could be presented and challenged. Being non-profit, The Alternative Museum's choice of artistic presentation was not governed by commercial interests. At the same time, maintaining a small staff that worked closely with the participating artists minimized the bureaucracy that so often beset larger institutions and permitted the exploration of provocative projects. The Alternative Museum became a complement to the larger established museums and a role model for newer artist founded organizations like Art in General and later on Exit Art.  Location and space  Originally housed on New York City's East Village, at 4th Street between Lafayette Street and the Bowery, The Alternative Museum moved in 1980 to White Street in Tribeca. In the summer of 1991, it moved to its last physical location at 594 Broadway in SoHo, at that time the heart of New York's cultural scene. Its last facilities included of exhibition space. Additional space for administration, and storage made up another .  Goals  Starting in 1975, The Alternative Museum pioneered fully integrated programming; its mission always mandated that its exhibitions, concerts and cultural programs as well as the organization itself include equitable participation by people from all racial, economic and gender backgrounds. In its 25-year history, The Alternative Museum presented over 300 exhibitions and more than 600 concerts, poetry readings, workshops and panel discussions. The Alternative Museum presented artists from almost every region of the United States as well as Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Alternative Museum’s first exhibition was “10 Japanese Artists” which led the way to the many presentations of contemporary art works and artists from the diverse global community at a time when most contemporary arts institutions were only interested in Eurocentric art. Through its integrated programs, The Alternative Museum developed a history and a catalogue archive of 25 years of issue-oriented art presentations. Creating a new paradigm, The Alternative Museum added a previously missing dimension to the American contemporary art scene that would later be emulated by many other art institutions. The Alternative Museum produced professional quality catalogs for its major exhibitions. Each catalog included biographies of participating artists, artists’ statements, photographic documentation and essays by art historians, scholars, and critics. These catalogs are collected by major museums and libraries worldwide, which provide a unique service for museum professionals and the exhibited artists.  Exhibitions  The Alternative Museum presented between five and seven exhibitions each year. Over its 25-year history, more than 2,700 artists exhibited at The Alternative Museum. From its inception, The Alternative Museum presented ground-breaking thematic exhibitions focusing on the pressing issues of American society, creating an ongoing dialogue which examined the definitions and boundaries of art and contemporary society. Exhibitions focused artistic interpretation and critical attention on such issues as homelessness (DIA DE LOS MUERTOS: THE HOMELESS); media manipulation (DISINFORMATION: THE MANUFACTURE OF CONSENT); and racial, ethnic and gender stereotypes (PRISONERS OF IMAGE). SYNCRETISM explored the merging of distinct cultural traditions, while PEOPLE'S CHOICE examined the actual aesthetic preferences of the American people and the impact of market research on its society. Equally important were The Alternative Museum's solo exhibitions, which included many of today's most outstanding artists, including Luis Cruz Azaceta, Komar and Melamed, Maureen Connor, Ben Sakoguchi, Luis Jimenez, Houston Conwill, Adrian Piper, Dennis Adams, and Tseng Kwong Chi. Other artists, such as HANNAH WILKE, DAVID HAMMONDS, ALFREDO JAAR, LEON GOLUB, ANDRES SERRANO, TIM ROLLINS K.O.S., X PREZ, and GROUP MATERIAL, were all exhibited at crucial moments in their careers. Starting in the fall of 1996, The Alternative Museum refocused its programming direction by concentrating on media based arts such as photography, video, film, computer generated art, and multimedia electronic installations – a missing dimension of arts programming in the downtown area of Manhattan.  Music program  In 1976, The Alternative Museum launched its World Music Program. For the first time, New York City had an ongoing venue where music from all over the world was presented in an informal environment that seated a maximum audience of 150 people. Traditional, folk, and modern music from India, Gambia, China, Peru, Ireland, the U.S., and many other countries found its way to American audiences. Concerts at The Alternative Museum looked like a gathering at the United Nations. The Alternative Museum also provided a showcase for experimental work that had little chance of exposure in conventional concert halls. In 1985, the main emphasis of The Alternative Museum's Music Program became the presentation of new American music, including music with firm roots in the classical and jazz traditions. Composers and musicians who performed at The Alternative Museum include: DON CHERRY, JOSEPH JARMAN, LEROY JENKINS, THE KRONOS QUARTET, CARMAN MOORE, BOB MORAN, HAMlET BLUIETT, JOAN LA BARBARA, FRANK LONDON, HORACE TAPSCOTT, TERRY RILEY, RICHARD TEITELBAUM, JOHN ZORN, HENRY THREADGILL, GLEN VELEZ and REGGIE WORKMAN.

Variants may include the addition of Bloody Mary mix. Although not a vodka martini, which consists of vodka and vermouth, the term \\"bacon martini\\" is consistent with the trend of calling any straight liquor in a martini glass a \\"martini,\\" such as the saketini or other variations. Origin The bacon martini was invented independently by Sang Yoon, owner of the gastropub Father's Office in Santa Monica, California, and P. Moss, owner of the Double Down Saloon in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sang Yoon made his bacon martini in 1998, inspired by the Bacon of the Month Club run by the Grateful Palate in Fairfield, California. P. Moss appears to have concocted his bacon martini the same year. Sang Yoon's version of the drink uses juniper-cured bacon, while P. Moss's method calls for hickory-smoked bacon. Preparation To make a bacon martini, the vodka needs to be prepared in advance through a process called fat washing.\\"Fat Washing for Bacon Infused Vodka\\" This is done by soaking strips of cooked bacon in vodka and straining off the fat, similar to the process for marinating meat before cooking. The drink is ready when the liquid becomes filmy and opaque. At the Double Down Saloon in the East Village in New York City, the bacon martini is created by straining the bacon-infused vodka through shaken ice and serving it in a martini glass with a piece of bacon at the bottom, similar to the worm in a bottle of mezcal. Taste The taste of bacon martinis is similar to that of vodka martinis, but with a spicier and saltier bacon flavor and a tangy \\"heat\\". According to a saloon owner, the pork fat reacts with vodka to give the drink its unique taste. Reviews of the beverage have been varied, with one drinker comparing it to Castrol motor oil, and a bacon enthusiast saying it was a satisfying and delicious beverage on many levels.

(July 2, 1823 – December 3, 1895) was a German businessman and political activist who emigrated to the United States as a result of his financial ruin related to participation in the Revolution of 1848. Born in Frankweiler in the Rheinpfalz in what was then the Kingdom of Bavaria, Cullmann was the son of a school principal. At the age of 13, he began attending the Zweibrücken Polytechnic Institute, taking a degree in engineering. He married the daughter of a wealthy banking family, Josephine Low, and settled in the town of Neustadt, founding an export business there. Cullmann became involved in revolutionary activity in Neustadt during the Revolution of 1848, and following the Bavarian crown's suppression of the rebellion with assistance from the Prussian Army, his business fell apart and he lost much of his wealth. In the years afterwards, he was able to re- establish himself but again lost his fortune following speculation during the Dano-Prussian War. Ruined in Germany, he began to look abroad for opportunity. His sights settled on the United States. However, at the time the American Civil War was ongoing, and fearing conscription, Cullmann temporarily settled in London in 1864. Not wanting to leave her family in Germany, his wife stayed behind. By 1865, Cullmann had made his way to New York City, the first stop in a series of residences including Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and a number of unsettled regions he was considering as places to establish himself and a small colony for German expatriates like him. In Cincinnati, he was able to establish himself as a lawyer and gathered the money to begin putting his colony together. He finally focused his attention on Alabama, where a proposed settlement near St. Florian in Lauderdale County was rejected by locals. However, through connections with Governor Robert M. Patton, he was able to conclude a deal with the Nashville-Montgomery Railroad in 1872 to purchase a tract of land near the modern day town of Cullman. In total, the land was , a vast plot that he quickly began to advertise to German-Americans. The railroad, whose business would benefit as more settlers made their homes along their rail line, made him a land agent and gave him the title of Colonel to reflect the new role. Cullmann spent the following years recruiting immigrants to settle his lands, beginning with the first 13 families he established the town of Cullmann with in 1873. There were plenty of interested immigrants from the same region as Cullmann, as the events that had precipitated his leaving his homeland had likewise encouraged thousands of his countrymen to seek a new home as well. His leadership brought nearly a thousand new settlers to the area within a few years, something many locals weren't happy with. In one notable instance, a local man stabbed Cullmann in the head during an assassination attempt, an attack he survived but which left a lifelong scar. However, over the next twenty years, he was able to build and incorporate the town of Cullman, Cullman County, and to re-establish himself as a wealthy businessman. He died on December 3, 1895 of pneumonia, leaving behind a small enclave of German settlers in the middle of the American south. Name Some sources state that Cullmann had earlier Americanized his name from \\"Kullmann\\". Stanley Johnson, his only surviving American descendant, told The Cullman Times in 1998 that there are no German records indicating \\"Kullmann\\", and that \\"Cullmann\\" was always the correct spelling.)

It also explains the mythical origin of Ratu Boko () palace, Sewu temple, and the Durga statue in Prambanan temple compound. The title Roro (pronounced /rɔrɔ/ in Javanese) is an ancient honorific title to address unmarried princesses and female nobility, thus the name Rara Jonggrang in Javanese means 'slender maiden'. Summary The legend tells the story about two ancient and neighbouring kingdoms in Java, Pengging and Boko. Pengging was prosperous, and wisely ruled by its king Prabu Damar Moyo () who had a son named Bandung Bondowoso. By contrast, Boko was ruled by a cruel man-eating giant named Prabu Boko, supported by another giant Patih Gupolo (). Despite his unpleasant nature, Prabu Boko had a beautiful daughter named Roro Jonggrang. The story relates that Prabu Boko desired to expand his kingdom, and so began training an army and raising taxes for an invasion of Pengging. His forces launched a surprise attack on Pengging, and the ensuring war caused devastation and famine on both sides. In order to defeat the invader, Prabu Damar Moyo sent his son Bandung Bondowoso to fight Prabu Boko. After a furious battle, Prabu Boko was killed by the prince's supernatural powers. His assistant, the giant Patih Gupolo, led his armies away from the battlefield in defeat. Returning to Boko Palace, Patih Gupolo told princess Rara Jonggrang of the death of her father. The princess was heartbroken, but before she could recover from her grief the Pengging army besieged and captured the palace. Prince Bandung Bandawasa was mesmerized by the beauty of the mourning princess and proposed marriage, but his offer was swiftly rejected. Bandung Bandawasa insisted on the union, and finally Rara Jonggrang agreed on two impossible conditions: first the prince must build a well named Jalatunda, and second, he must construct a thousand temples in only one night. The love-struck prince agreed, and immediately started work on the well. Using his supernatural powers once again and summoning all manner of demons, the prince swiftly finished construction and proudly displayed his work for the princess. As a trick, she urged him to enter the well and when he did so, Patih Gupolo piled stones into it and buried him alive. With great effort Bandung Bandawasa escaped, but his love for the princess was so strong that he forgave her the attempt on his life. To fulfill the second condition, the prince entered into meditation and conjured up a multitude of spirits from the earth. With their help he built the first 999 temples and started work on the final one. To thwart his efforts the princess and her maids lit fires in the east direction and begin pounding rice padi, a traditional dawn activity. The roosters crowed. Fooled into thinking the sun was about to rise, the spirits fled back to the darkness, leaving the last temple unfinished. The prince was furious when he learned of this deception, and He did not want to pay the blood price of sorcery alone. She tried to plead for mercy, as the prince seemed possessed by preternatural powers. But he placed a curse on Rara Jonggrang, turning her into stone. In this way she herself became a feature of the final temple, completing its construction and fulfilling the conditions for their marriage. The Interpretation A depiction of the legend on an Indonesian stamp This legend is a local popular folklore that connects and explains the supernatural origin of Central Java's famous archaeological sites; such as of the Ratu Boko palace, the Durga statue in northern cella/chamber of the main Prambanan shrine, and the Sewu temple complex nearby. Although the temples itself dated from circa 9th century, the legend was composed in later times, probably during Mataram Sultanate era. According to tradition, this thousandth temple is part of the Sewu temple compound (sèwu means \\"thousands\\" in Javanese), and the Princess is the image of Durga in the north cell of the Shiva temple at Prambanan, still known as Rara Jonggrang or Slender Virgin. Another interpretation mentioned that this legend could be a collective but vague local memory about past historical events that happened in the area, staged around the 9th century struggle for power between the Sailendra and the Sanjaya dynasty for control of Central Java. King Boko is probably inspired by the King Samaratungga of Sailendra dynasty, Bandung Bondowoso is Rakai Pikatan, a prince of Sanjaya dynasty, and Rara Jongrang is Pramodhawardhani, wife of Rakai Pikatan and the daughter of Sailendran king. The actual historical event was probably the contest of power between Balaputradewa, the Sailendran heir, against his sister, Pramodhawardhani, aided by her husband, Rakai Pikatan, which led to Pikatan as the victor, thus ending the Sailendran rule on Central Java.

Chesnutt, first published in July 1898. It later served as the title story of the collection The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color-Line. That book was first published in 1899, the same year Chesnutt published his short story collection The Conjure Woman. \\"The Wife of His Youth\\" features an upwardly mobile, light-skinned mulatto man, a respected member of the Blue Veins Society in a Midwestern city. He is preparing to marry another light- skinned mulatto woman when a much darker woman comes to him seeking her husband, whom she has not seen in 25 years. The story, which was met positively upon its publication, has become Chesnutt's most anthologized work. The story has been read as an analysis of race relations, not between black and white but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.  Plot  \\"The Wife of His Youth\\" follows Mr. Ryder, a bi-racial man who was born and reared free before the Civil War. He heads the \\"Blue Veins Society\\", a social organization for colored people in a northern town; the membership consists of people with a high proportion of European ancestry, who look more white than black. The organization's name stemmed from the joke that one would have to be so white (to be a member) that veins could be seen through the skin. Ryder is sought after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose to her at the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired apprentice to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves. At the ball Ryder addresses the members and tells them 'Liza Jane's story. At the conclusion, he asks the attendees whether or not they think the man should acknowledge his wife. Everyone urges yes. He brings out 'Liza and says, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the woman, and I am the man, whose story I have told you. Permit me to introduce to you the wife of my youth.\\"  Publication and response  Charles W. Chesnutt, author of \\"The Wife of His Youth\\", c. 1899 \\"The Wife of His Youth\\" was first published in the July 1898 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, without reference to the author's own racial background (he was African American, with majority-white ancestry).Chakkalakal, Tess. \\"Wedded to the Color Line: Charles Chesnutt's Stories of Segregation\\", in Representing Segregation: Toward an Aesthetics of Living Jim Crow, and Other Forms of Racial Division (Brian Norman and Piper Kendrix Williams, editors).

After Chesnutt read several compliments from friends and in various newspaper reviews, he wrote to editor Walter Hines Page, \\"taking it all in all, I have had a slight glimpse of what it means, I imagine, to be a successful author.\\" One later review by influential critic William Dean Howells particularly praised Chesnutt. In \\"The Wife of His Youth\\", Howells was impressed that the main character offered up a Christ-like sacrifice, unimpeded by his being African American.McElrath, Joesph R., Jr. \\"W. D.

In 1891, Chesnutt contacted Aldrich's successor Horace Scudder about publishing a book of his tales and revealed his African-American heritage. Scudder advised against trying a book at that time, and suggested Chesnutt wait until he earned a broader reputation.

White readers, such as William Dean Howells, considered this a realistic portrayal of mixed-race Americans, revealed by Chesnutt as an \\"insider\\", much as Paul Laurence Dunbar had shown whites the lyrical side of blacks. Howells wrote: Ultimately, Chesnutt is challenging the idea of two \\"races.\\" The story serves as an allegory of the changing relationship of freeborn and freedmen, mixed race and blacks, in a post-Reconstruction Era. Such differences are expressed in language used by the characters, which also reflects differing education and class levels. Ryder tries to speak in the higher rhetoric of \\"white\\" English (emulating the Tennyson he reads) while 'Liza uses a thick black dialect. That difference is further emphasized by Ryder's writing 'Liza's address in the flyleaf of his Tennyson book and, when recounting her story, switching into his own \\"soft dialect\\".McWilliams, Dean. Charles W. Chesnutt and the Fictions of Race. Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2002: 112. Ann duCille suggests the story questions the legality of marriage during enslavement.

Her husband died in 1795, and in 1798 she married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé.  Life Early life= Maria Caterina was the daughter of Giuseppe Brignole-Sale, Marquis di Groppoli, and Maria Anna Balbi, daughter of Francesco Maria Balbi, who had been Doge of Genoa in 1732. As her father was the Genovese ambassador to France, Maria Caterina and her mother frequented the salons of Paris and the royal court of Versailles. Her biographer, Philippe Paul, Comte de Ségur, called Maria Caterina \\"the most beautiful woman in France\\". In 1755, a marriage was proposed between Maria Caterina and Prince Honoré III of Monaco. Honoré III had previously been the lover of her mother,Anne Edwards, The Grimaldis of Monaco, 1992 but wished to marry to provide an heir to his throne, and was attracted by Maria Caterina's beauty. The Prince had declined many marriage proposals, but was willing to marry Maria Caterina because of her beauty and dowry. Her father, however, disagreed because of the bad reputation of Prince Honoré as well as the prospect of the Prince inheriting his fortune. He relented only after intervention by King Louis XV of France and Madame de Pompadour, giving his consent in late 1756. =Princess of Monaco= The marriage ceremony took place 15 June 1757 in Genoa per procura without the groom present. Maria Caterina came to Monaco by boat accompanied by a suite of the Genovese nobility. When they arrived, however, Prince Honoré did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. When they asked him to do so, he replied that his status as a monarch demanded that she come to him instead. The Genovese entourage answered that Maria Caterina, was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa (her uncles, Gian Francesco and Rodolfo Brignole-Sale, held the dogeship in, respectively, 1746–48 and 1762–64).Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser IV. \\"Monaco\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 1956, p. 75. (German). and refused to do so. The ship was therefore stranded offshore for several days, until the predicament was resolved by the couple meeting halfway on a bridge between the boat and the shore. The relationship was at first amicable, and the couple had two sons, Honoré IV, Prince of Monaco (born 17 May 1758) and Prince Joseph (born in 1763). Maria Caterina was described as beautiful and charming and, initially, as truly in love with her spouse. Honoré III was however not satisfied with his life in Monaco, where the political issues were managed by his uncle the Chevalier de Grimaldi, and in the summer of 1760, he left for Paris and left Maria Caterina behind. When he eventually allowed her to join him in Paris, the marriage deteriorated, with Honoré spending more and more time with his mistress in Normandy. Maria Caterina attended the French royal court and high society life, but was described as an introverted personality who preferred to sit with the elderly during the balls rather than to dance and who did not use make up, but also considered a great beauty. Maria Caterina lived in Matignon, where she spent her days with the Prince de Condé, and seldom took part in court life. Honoré became more and more jealous, and demanded that she write down her thoughts for him. Once, she was alone for several hours with a handsome nobleman, who helped her to open a cupboard which had been stuck. After this incident, the jealousy of her husband worsened to the point where it was no longer endurable. In 1765, it attracted attention in Paris that she was courted by the Prince of Condé, Louis Joseph de Bourbon. When her spouse was informed by his brother's wife Marie Christine de Rouvroy, he returned from his own adultery in Normandy to scold her: when he left, Maria Caterina, who until then had regarded Condé as merely a friend, reportedly responded to Condé's feelings, and they became involved in a love affair. Honoré III and Maria Caterina lived separate lives with their own lovers, and he did not bring her with him during his state visit to London in 1768. By 1769 she had begun to set up a home in the Hôtel de Lassay, an annex of the Prince de Condé's primary residence in Paris, the Palais-Bourbon.Braham (1980), p. 215. In 1769, Honoré III, who was informed of Maria Caterina's adultery, responded by returning to Paris and openly flaunted his lovers and his adultery, upon which Mara Caterina left Paris to seek asylum in the convent of Visitation in Le Mans under the protection of her uncle, who was the bishop there. Mediation by her mother brought about a temporary reconciliation, but when her father died and left his fortune to his daughter on the condition that her husband should have no access to it, Honoré III threatened to have her sent back to Monaco, upon which Maria Caterina again sought asylum in Le Mans. =Mistress of Condé= On 9 January 1770, the lover of Maria Caterina, the Prince de Condé, managed to use his influence to obtain a legal separation from her husband and the right to manage her own fortune. Maria Caterina moved in with her lover days after her official separation was approved, and openly lived happily with him in his residence Chateau de Chantilly in Paris. Honoré finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was finished and turned his attention to his own lovers. Maria Caterina wrote to her spouse that the marriage could be summarised by three words: greed, bravery, and jealousy. Honoré III eventually accepted the relationship, and she acquired the Chateau de Betz, where Honoré allowed her to meet her sons. In 1774, due to Maria Caterina's illicit position as Condé's mistress and status as a separated woman, the new French queen, 18-year-old Marie Antoinette, offended Condé by refusing to receive Maria Caterina at court. Around 1774, Condé and Maria Caterina began the construction of the Hôtel de Monaco, to be her permanent home in Paris. It was in the rue Saint- Dominique, near the Palais Bourbon, and was completed in 1777. = Exile= Maria lived with Condé in France until the outbreak of the French revolution in 1789, when the couple left for Germany. In 1791, she lived with Condé in Koblenz, where she was one of the leading ladies of the French exile émigrée court, termed as one of the 'Queens of the Emigration' along with the mistress of the count of Provence, Anne de Balbi, and the mistress of the count of Artois, Louise de Polastron.Sandars, Mary Frances. Louis XVIII (Kelly - University of Toronto, 1910). The prince was the leader of the Condé army of émigrés. She used her great fortune to help finance the exiled French community's armed resistance. The émigrée court at Koblenz was dissolved in 1792, and the couple left for Great Britain. In 1795, Prince Honoré died, and on 24 October 1798 she and the prince de Condé were married in London.The Royalty, peerage and aristocracy of the world, Vol 90 The marriage was kept secret for a decade, the couple reportedly only becoming openly known as husband and wife as of 26 December 1808. She died at Wimbledon House in Wimbledon on 28 March 1813, and was buried at the French émigré chapel, St Aloysius Church in Somers Town, London on 4 April.

It should be built immediately, and garrisoned by at least one full company, with a sufficient number of mules and riding saddles to mount a party large enough (say thirty) to follow rapidly and chastise all Indians that may commit depredations within fifty miles of it. This I believe will soon put a stop to all depredations and give ample security to the inhabitants and their property.

Life He was the son of Abraham Lott and Maria Lott. He was educated at the Flatbush Academy, and graduated from Union College in 1823. Then he studied law with Henry E. Werner in New York City. On February 16, 1829, he married his first cousin Catherine Lott (b. 1807). In 1835, he began practicing law in Brooklyn with Henry C. Murphy, and soon entered politics as a Democrat. In 1838, he was appointed by Governor William L. Marcy Judge of the Kings County Court. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co.) in 1842. He was a member of the New York State Senate (1st D.) from 1843 to 1846, sitting in the 66th, 67th, 68th and 69th New York State Legislatures. In 1849, he ran on the Democratic ticket for New York State Comptroller, but was defeated by the incumbent Whig Washington Hunt. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (2nd District) from 1858 to 1869, elected in 1857 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William Rockwell, and re-elected in 1861 to a full eight-year term. He was ex officio a judge of the Court of Appeals in 1861 and 1869. In 1869, he was elected to an eight-year term on the New York Court of Appeals, but at the same election a constitutional amendment re-organized the Court of Appeals, and Lott remained on the bench only for six months, until July 4, 1870, when the new judges took office. However, Lott was appointed a Commissioner of Appeals. In 1874, he was made president of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway, but resigned a few weeks before his death. At the time of his death he was president of the Flatbush Board of Improvement. During the last two years of his life, he had suffered from diabetes. He died suddenly, dropping dead in the bathroom of his residence. He was buried at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

Such buildings were common in Sussex County, Delaware, and adjoining areas of Delaware, Maine, and Maryland in the early 20th century, when sweet potato production was at its local peak. Potato houses were typically two- story wood frame structures, of tall and narrow proportions, heated in winter with a coal or wood stove. Potatoes were stored from October through February, requiring a constant temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The potato houses were constructed to allow the free circulation of air among the stored crop, sometimes employing gaps between the bins and the exterior walls or at the floor level. The tall, narrow proportions of the houses encouraged circulation. Windows were typically provided at the top of the house to allow ventilation if temperatures rose too high. Multiple layers of siding, the use of red rosin paper for sealing against drafts, and sometimes the use of sawdust as insulation were other measures to safeguard the crop. In general, potato houses were two stories tall, with gable roofs aligned with the long axis. The entrances were through the gable ends, with doors at the first and second floors in the front with an attic window for ventilation in the gables. Rear elevations usually featured a door at the first floor and windows at the second floor and gable. Side elevations were generally plain, with shuttered windows or doors. Openings fit tightly. While two-story elevations were typical, 1-1/2 to three-story houses existed. Most potato houses have been demolished or have been converted to other uses. A number of surviving potato houses has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Personal life  Laura Ross-Paul was born in Portland, Oregon in 1950.

In 1968, Ross-Paul worked as a political cartoonist and illustrator for The Scab Sheet 10 cents for the Truth, a Vietnam-era underground anti-war newspaper in Corvallis, Oregon. In 1974, Ross-Paul received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting from Fort Wright College. She went on to obtain her Master of Fine Arts in Painting and her B.S. from Portland State University. She married Alex Paul in 1970. In 2014 Ross-Paul, her husband Alex, and Dr. Peter Littrup published They're Mine and I'm Keeping Them through the self- publishing service CreateSpace, an account of her experience with breast cancer and seeking successful cryoablation treatment for it. Ross-Paul illustrated the book.  Career  Ross-Paul frequently uses the landscape of the Pacific Northwest as a background for her paintings. Her style uses the inherent qualities of the medium and lets paint bleed across her composition, frequently using a resin compound to blur the colors together to achieve a soft look. Geometric shapes such as orbs are a common reoccurring motif in her paintings. Her 2002 collection is a strong example of this.

Professor In January 1899 Prince Maximilian graduated Doctor of Theology from the University of Würzburg. After working as a pastor at a church in Nuremberg, on 21 August 1900 Prince Maximilian accepted the post of Professor of Canon Law at the University of Fribourg. In late 1910 Prince Maximilian caused controversy by publishing an article in an ecclesiastical periodical on the union of the Eastern and Roman churches. Prince Maximilian argued that the six dogmas should be waived in order to facilitate the return of the Eastern to the Catholic Church. Consequently upon the article he went to see Pope Pius X to explain, and as a result of the meeting agreed to retract the article and signed a declaration acknowledging errors in it. It was announced that he had renewed his full and unconditional adhesion to the doctrines of the Catholic Church. War During the First World War Prince Maximilian served as an Army chaplain and in this capacity he attended to wounded soldiers, gave unction to the dying and said mass while under shell fire. He was liked by the French prisoners of war as he also dedicated himself to their welfare. He also used the international bureau in Geneva to send word to the families of the French prisoners. Following the German Empire's defeat in the war his brother King Frederick Augustus III was forced to abdicate as the monarchy was abolished.

James II of Scotland had started a campaign to recapture Roxburgh and Berwick from the English, while the rulers of England were occupied with the Wars of the Roses. King James would die during the siege.  Background  Following the Wars of Scottish Independence a century earlier, Roxburgh was one of the last castles in Scotland still to be held by the English. By 1460, England was in the middle of civil war, the Wars of the Roses, and it would seem that both sides had requested the aid of King James in this struggle, with James intending to use the opportunity to take back both Roxburgh and Berwick for Scotland. Prior to the attack on Roxburgh, the English had believed that Berwick was the target, and were thus outmaneuvered.  Siege  King James and his army first arrived at Berwick in July, first taking and demolishing the English dominated town. When the castle refused to surrender, James began the siege. On the 3rd August the James was standing close to one of his cannons when he ordered it to be fired. The cannon exploded, mortally wounding him. Following his death, James' queen, Mary of Guelders, ordered the army to continue the siege. The castle would surrender on the 5th August, with the defenders allowed to depart and no prisoners being taken.  Aftermath  Following the siege the castle was destroyed so it could not be used by the English again. With the death of the King, Mary of Guelders and Bishop James Kennedy ruled as regents until James III of Scotland was old enough to rule. During this time, Mary would prove an able diplomat, gaining Berwick in return for supplying aid to the Lancastrians.

Bred by Highclere Stud, Niche was owned by Lord Carnarvon - the Queen's racing manager, owner of top class fillies Lemon Souffle and Lyric Fantasy, and grandson of George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon who discovered the tomb of Tutenkhamun. Racing career Trained by Richard Hannon, Sr., and ridden in all her races bar one by the (then) 57-year-old Lester Piggott, Niche started her career with three wins in a row, including the Group 3 Norfolk Stakes. In her fourth race, the Cherry Hinton Stakes (one of the top 2yo filly races of the season) she met Sayyedati for the first time, finishing fourth carrying a penalty. These fillies would battle for honours throughout their two- and three-year-old careers. Before the end of her first season, Niche also went on to win the Group 2 Lowther Stakes over 6f. At 3yo, Niche met Sayyedati in the classic trial the Nell Gwyn Stakes, beating her rival and placing her at the top of the betting for the 1,000 Guineas. Sayyedati hit back in the one mile fillies classic, beating Niche into 2nd when Lester Piggott reputedly felt that she became unbalanced in the Dip. Sayyedati would go on to win the Sussex Stakes and the Prix Jacques le Marios. Niche went on to win the Group 2 Falmouth Stakes beating Dancing Bloom (Princess Royal Stakes) and Culture Vulture (Premio Emilio Turati, Prix Marcel Boussac, Fillies Mile), winning unchallenged in what would turn out to be her last race. Untimely Death Whilst in training for the Prix Jacques Le Marois, Niche unseated her rider on the gallops, running into the road and collided with a van. She died almost immediately. Her trainer, Richard Hannon, Sr. said: \\"'She caught the edge of the all-weather gallop, stumbled and went down, her lad going over the top. I went after her but then she crossed a minor road, which normally wouldn't see 10 cars between 7am and 4pm. It was a million to one chance. My blacksmith was travelling slowly up the road and the filly crashed into his van. She died within a minute. She was one of the best I've trained. I still cannot believe it's happened.\\" Lady Carolyn Warren, daughter of Lord Carnarvon, added: \\"'She was such a gutsy filly, very brave and gave us a tremendous amount of pleasure. It is a major loss for us and must have been horrible for Richard Hannon to be at the scene.\\" Pedigree Niche is by Risk Me, British-trained French Champion 2yo and winner of the Prix Jean Prat, Grand Prix de Paris, Greenham Stakes and the National Stakes.

The video game was produced by Disney Interactive Studios, Heavy Iron Studios and Pixar. A Nintendo 3DS version was intended for release, but was cancelled due to its concerns. Plot The story centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell who fly to South America in a house suspended by helium balloons. The PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii versions of the game follow the film's plot more tightly, spanning eleven levels, with some liberties taken. The PS2, PSP and PC versions are a much looser adaptation, in which Carl and Russell take longer detours through the jungle to attempt to reach the end of Paradise Falls. Consequently, those versions are over 20 levels long.  Gameplay  Up follows the storyline of the film, featuring Carl, Russell, and Dug walking through the jungles of Venezuela. All of the mentioned characters are playable in the game, and in all versions, the player must switch between them to take advantage of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles, while being careful to avoid injury as all playable characters (depending on the version) share a single health bar. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was the first game based on a Pixar film to support the trophy system. This version and the Xbox 360 version feature online achievements that are themed off of Wilderness Explorer badges. All versions feature multiplayer aerial combat in addition to the main story mode. = Version differences = The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii versions are fast-paced platformers with some puzzle scenarios and plays similar to LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, but can be finished in about an hour or two. The Wii version is slightly different than the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions in that it uses more artfully rendered visuals to accommodate that system's graphical constraints (for example, rocks have purplish textures and the sky is represented with a cartoony skybox in the Wii version, while rocks have brownish, more realistic textures and the sky is represented by a fluid skydome in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions). The Wii version also supports optional motion controls to perform certain actions, such as shaking the Wii Remote to launch rocks as missiles or tilting it down to reach over ledges to help a partner up. Carl and Russell can also use special abilities for a limited number of times to scare off or distract enemies or bosses, accessed by pressing certain directions of the directional pad. Cutscenes are presented in newsreel format, similar to Spotlight on Adventure in the film's first scene. Character health is measured discretely in these versions, and the characters' survivability gradually increases automatically as the game progresses. These versions also have the fewest bosses, which are simply a giant anaconda, a crocodile, and The Spirit of Adventure, Muntz's airship. There are two biplane sequences, one at the start of the game that takes place immediately before a final battle over Paradise Falls, and another for the actual battle, and in both of them, a second player can \\"man the guns\\" and fire at incoming enemies and ground artillery with an on-screen reticule, while sharing the first player's camera view. This feature also takes advantage of the Wii Remote pointer in the Wii version to control Player 2's reticule. Loading screens in these versions also displays hints and trivia about the real wildlife near the tepui. The PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PC/Mac versions of the game are longer, giving the player more opportunities to explore the various terrain atop the tepui as the characters take longer detours to reach their destination. At the beginning of these versions, the player is exclusively required to stop the house from floating away. These versions also exclusively feature side areas that cannot be accessed the first time around without acquiring a certain tool, as well as fast-moving linear levels (namely on-rails chase sequences played from a reverse angle or river canoeing courses), where players cannot backtrack and must carefully avoid accidents that instantly require a restart from a checkpoint. Health is measured in a continuous gauge. There are four bosses in these versions, which are three battles against some of Muntz's top dogs, along with The Spirit of Adventure. The Nintendo DS version is only six levels long, but they usually consist of one or more large areas and players are required to have Carl and Russell together at the end of each level (and at the end of each part of some levels), which becomes a challenge as the characters are easily separated in this version. There is also a boss at the end of each level. Exclusively in this version, players must acquire and use certain tools to overcome obstacles (although the use of such tools is constrained by an energy meter), and are encouraged to finish levels as fast as possible, but must be careful not to arouse too much suspicion from Muntz's dogs, who patrol the jungle and will engage Carl and Russell in battle if they move around too often. Characters also share a continuous health bar as in the PS2, PSP and PC versions, although total loss of health would require a full restart of the current level due to a lack of checkpoints. However, levels that are divided into multiple sections offer a fresh spring in between areas that can fully replenish health. In between levels, players are taken to a campsite where they can purchase health upgrades and consumable supplies for power-ups, examine acquired tools, save progress and more. Some sequences involve using touch screen gestures, such as pulling a lever to extend a bridge, turning a crank to operate an elevator or repeatedly scribbling on the screen to break free of traps. This version also exclusively has mini-games that can be played with a friend who has a copy of the game.  Reception  The PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to the review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported for DS and Wii and published by E Frontier on December 3, 2009, Famitsu gave it a score of all four sixes for the DS version, and three sevens and one six for the Wii version.

The town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its castle were captured and the English army briefly occupied Edinburgh. These events followed the signing of the Treaty of Fotheringhay, 11 June 1482, in which Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, the brother of James III of Scotland declared himself King of Scotland and swore loyalty to Edward IV of England. The follow-up invasion of Scotland under the command of Edward's brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester failed to install Albany on the throne, but Berwick has remained English ever since the castle surrendered on 24 August. The English army left Edinburgh with a promise for the repayment of the dowry paid for the marriage of Princess Cecily of England to the Scottish Prince. Treaty of Fotheringhay Edward IV was disappointed by the failure of his 1474 treaty with James III who had promised that his son, Prince James would marry Cecily of York. The betrothal was made in October 1474 with a forty-five year truce to last until 1519. Her dowry payments were to be made yearly on 3 February in Edinburgh, brought by Edward's servants from Norham Castle, and a meeting was to be held to resolve the dispute over the 'fish-garth,' a salmon trap on the Esk.Rymer, Foedera, vol. 11, pp. 820–34: see Rymer, Thomas, Foedera, conventiones, literae,... inter Reges Angliae et alios, vol. 5 part 1 & 2 (Johannes Neaulm, Hague, 1741) part 2, pp. 44, 47–53. Since February 1475, Edward's officers had delivered installments of Cecilia's 20,000 mark dowry to James's treasurer in St Giles, Edinburgh.Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland, vol.4 (London, 1888), nos. 1425, 1434, 1437, 1444, 1446, 1449, 1450, 1456. However, border conflict had restarted in 1480, perhaps due to Scotland's Auld Alliance with France.Ross, Charles, Edward IV, University of California, (1974), p.213, 278–9 According to a chronicle, the Earl of Angus had attacked Bamburgh Castle, and the Earl of Northumberland had raided in Scotland.Kirkby, Joan, ed., Plumpton letters, CUP/Camden, (1996), p. 56: Macdougall, Norman, James III (John Donald, Edinburgh, 1982), p. 311. By October, James III had written to Louis XI of France asking for guns and artillerymen to repulse further attacks.Calendar State Papers Milan, vol.1 (London, 1912), p.245 Eleven ships were put on war-footing for Scotland in February 1481 and Sir Robert Radcliffe was commanded to arm a fleet with guns and gunners on 8 July. These ships made raids in Forth, attacking Blackness Castle and harassing shipping in the spring and autumn of 1481. There does not seem to have been a land-based invasion of Scotland, but there were three raids into England by a Scottish army in that year. Edward IV had made invasion preparations and began to travel north, but went no further than Nottingham.Ross, Charles, Edward IV (University of California, 1974), pp. 281–3. In May 1482 James III's brother, Alexander, Duke of Albany landed in England at Southampton from France in a Scottish carvel, the Michael, captained by James Douglas. Edward IV seized this new opportunity to invade Scotland, hired Master Douglas and his ship on 9 May, and summoned fighting-men for the cause of the \\"king of Scotland\\" on 10 May. Edward IV, Albany and Richard, Duke of Gloucester made a formal treaty at Fotheringhay Castle near Peterborough, where Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned and executed a century later. According to the treaty, Alexander, if he became King of Scotland, would reserve to Edward IV the town of Berwick upon Tweed, Lochmaben Castle with land in southern Scotland in Annandale, Liddesdale, Eskdale, and Ewesdale. He would do homage to Edward IV and break the Auld Alliance with France. If he could extract himself from other engagements in the sight of the Church, he would marry Cecily of York. He had already married Anne de la Tour, the daughter of the Count of Auvergne and Bouillon in January. On 11 June, Albany signed \\"Alexander R.,\\" for Alexander, Rex.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 5 part 1 & 2 (Johannes Neaulm, Hague, 1741), pp. 120–1. The invasion Edward IV had been preparing an army of 20,000 men to invade Scotland by sea and land, and on 12 June Richard, Duke of Gloucester was made commander, with John Elrington appointed war-treasurer on 22 June.Foedera, vol.12, p.158 One of his officers, Francis Lovell, had his orders before 24 June, as he wrote that he could not travel south from Tanfield near Durham for the feast of John the Baptist as he had a command in Gloucester's army.Calendar Documents Scotland, vol.5, Scottish Record Office (n.d.) p.303 no.1100 Equipped with 2,000 sheaves of arrows and ordnance brought from Newcastle upon Tyne by 120 cart horses, Gloucester and Albany recaptured Berwick. The town had been in Scottish hands for the previous twenty years after the Lancastrian fugitives Henry VI of England, and his wife Margaret of Anjou gave it to James, and was held by David Lindsay, Earl of Crawford and Andrew, Lord Gray. They surrendered by negotiation, although the castle held out for Scotland.Foedera, vol.5 part 2 (Hague, 1741), p.114, 120–2: Foedera, vol. 12 (London, 1711), pp. 120 (11 ships February 1481), 154, 156. Edward IV and the Duke of Albany made a deal to invade Scotland at Fotheringhay Castle =Lauder Bridge= The English army moved west from Berwick and divided into two. The Earl of Northumberland stayed on the Scottish border taking castles and bastle houses and burning farms at Kirk Yetholm, Bemersyde, Morebattle, Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Ednam, and other places. Richard, Duke of Gloucester also moved west to Kimmerghame with the support of James, Earl of Douglas, but near Duns turned north-west to Edinburgh.Hall, Chronicle, (1809), p.332 list of place names, mostly between Berwick and Duns. The Scottish army of James III got no further south than Lauder Bridge, to the west of Gloucester's route, where there was some kind of mutiny involving Archibald, Earl of Angus. The exact events at Lauder are unclear, but chronicles relate that some of the king's favourites including the architect Robert Cochrane, merchant Thomas Preston, and composer Sir William Roger were hanged from the bridge.http://www.lauder.bordernet.co.uk/history/articles/jamesiii.html James III was brought back to Edinburgh on 22 July. There were now three clear factions in Scotland; Albany's party, the loyalists, and the Lauder mutineers. The Queen at Stirling with Prince James may also have had independent influence. A London merchant, George Cely, wrote a letter with exaggerated news of the campaign in July; > \\"the Dewke of Albany ys comyn ynto Ynglond and he has sworne to Kyngys good > grace, and the King hasse sent hym ynto Scottland wyth 60,000 men yn iii > battelles and many lordys of Ynglond wyth hym, ...

E., 'An unedited Cely letter', in > Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, vol.10 (1916), pp.159–165: > Cely's letter is an unsent draft, the mention of Dumfries reflects Percy's > western march. Richard, Duke of Gloucester marched on Edinburgh but was unable to put Albany on the throne =Richard, Duke of Gloucester at Edinburgh= At the beginning of August, Richard's army entered Edinburgh but he could not establish Albany as King. James III remained safe in Edinburgh Castle apparently as a prisoner of the lords who had mutinied at Lauder, although he had secretly contracted with the Keeper Lord Darnley and the garrison for his safety.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), p.173 citing Fraser, William, Lennox, vol.1, pp.124–6 Richard, not expecting to meet this coup d'état, did not have resources to besiege the castle. As the details of the Fotheringhay treaty became known, vital Scottish support for Albany as king evaporated. Albany, his brother's party, and the keepers of the castle became reconciled. On 2 August Albany and Gloucester signed a bond with Colin, Earl of Argyll, Archbisbop Scheves, Lord Avandale, and the Bishop of Dunkeld which promised a pardon for Albany and the restoration of his previous dignities.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), p.168: Foedera, vol.12 (1711), p.160 The English army made a truce on 4 August and withdrew with an undertaking from the town of Edinburgh to repay an advance on Cecilia's dowry which Edward had given to James III. The money had been paid as James III had previously promised his son Prince James would marry Cecilia. Albany was left to take possession of Edinburgh Castle and become for a time his brother's keeper.Tytler, P. F., History of Scotland, book 2 chapter 4, various editions: Macdougall, Norman, James III, John Donald (1982), p.129, 152–173 Gloucester left 1,700 men to assault Berwick Castle on 11 August and the castle was captured after a fortnight's siege.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), p.169: Devon, Frederick, ed., Issues of the Exchequer (London, 1837), p.501. Edward IV wrote to Pope Sixtus IV on 25 August describing the campaign in Scotland, explaining that Richard had spared all the citizens of Edinburgh, helped by the intercession of Albany, who was restored to his estates by the power of the English army. Edward explained that the taking of Berwick was the chief advantage he had gained. Berwick Castle, Edward writes, was taken on the army's return, not without slaughter and bloodshed. This letter was written before news of surrender of the castle could have reached him, according to the date 24 August given in the chronicles of Raphael Holinshed, John Lesley, and Edward Hall.Calendar State Papers Venice, vol.1 (1864), no.483, 25 August / 8 Kalends September 1482: Macdougall, Norman, James III (1982), pp. 169, 182 n54. =Siege of Edinburgh Castle= After Gloucester's departure, Albany seems from the chronicle stories to have looked for supporters for his faction, possibly including discussions with the Queen Margaret of Denmark at Stirling Castle, then besieged Edinburgh Castle.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), pp.7–9. James III came out on 29 September, but Lord Darnley, who had joined James's party, held it in defence till 7 October.Macdougall, Norman, James III (1982), pp. 170–173, the source cited has James in the castle from 22 July to 29 September British Library Royal MS.17 Dxx f.308r. The historian Norman Macdougall supposed that James III came out of the castle after Albany made a deal with his half-uncles and rebels at Lauder, John Stewart, Earl of Atholl and James Stewart, Earl of Buchan.Macdougal, Norman, James IV (Tuckwell, 1997), pp. 9–10. James wrote an official letter to Lord Darnley on 19 October which confirmed that he was brought from Lauder and held in the castle against his will. The letter exonerated the garrison from any censure. Darnley, James III wrote, had made a compact with him for his safety, and held the castle against Albany's siege on James's orders.Fraser, William, Lennox Book, vol.2 (Edinburgh, 1874), pp. 121–123. =Aftermath= For some months Albany remained powerful in Scotland, and on 11 December, James III made him \\"Lieutenant-General of the realm\\" to defend the borders from English raids.Brown, K. M., and others eds., Records of the Scottish Parliament to 1707, NAS PA2/3 f.32v When James III was restored to power, on 8 January 1483 he rewarded the Provost of Edinburgh Walter Bertrahame, who had underwritten the bond to repay Cecilia's dowry while the King was captive and warded in Edinburgh Castle, with a pension of £40. He also paid bills from July for minting an unpopular base-metal copper \\"black money\\" coinage and £214 for iron used for making serpentines and other guns, and arranged for the repayment of money seized from George Robison, the customs officer of Edinburgh, at Lauder.Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, vol.9, Edinburgh (1886), 218–220: the bond is printed in Foedera. Albany went to Dunbar Castle and renewed his treaty with Edward IV in February. The new treaty was made at Westminster by Henry Earl of Northumberland, John Lord Scrope and William Parr with the Earl of Angus, Andrew Lord Grey and James Liddale of Halkerston. This had the unintended effect of strengthening home support for his elder brother.Foedera, vol.5 part 2, Hague (1741), p.127-128: Macdougall, Norman, James III (1982), 180, 184 Albany was forfeited as a traitor by the Parliament of Scotland in June, for making this new treaty, not for the events of the previous summer.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol.2 (1814), p.147 After a period of exile, joined with the Earl of Douglas, his next attempt in Scotland was defeated at the Battle of Lochmaben Fair. In England the boast \\"I was a captain when Barwycke was wonne\\" became a commonplace saying and was included in the Eton headmaster William Horman's 1519 Latin phrasebook Vulgaria as \\"Duxi ordinē qň Berwikũ venit in potestē.\\"Horman, William, Vulgaria, Richard Pynson (1519), f. 261v. The Scottish chronicles and Berwick Castle The Trinity Altarpiece shows from right, Margaret of Denmark facing James III with their son James, Duke of Rothesay, Royal Collection / National Gallery of Scotland The sixteenth century Scottish chronicles present a differing story. All accounts emphasise the coinage of the \\"black metal\\" currency and its devaluation as major factor in the King's unpopularity at Lauder,Holmes, NicholasScottish Coins (NMS, 1998), pp. 22–27, for the \\"black money.\\" along with his favouritism of non-noble upstarts. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, probably writing in the 1570s, misunderstands the Treaty of Fotheringhay and presents Albany as his brother's rescuer after the coup at Lauder Bridge, seeking English support at the King's request. After Gloucester comes to Edinburgh and James III is released, the royal brothers ride together from the Castle to Holyroodhouse. Then Pitscottie has the brothers and the Duke of Gloucester travel to Stirling and tour Scotland.Dalyell, ed., Robert Lindsay's: Chronicles of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1814), pp. 184–201, see external links. This may represent Albany's labours to build his faction while James III remained in Edinburgh Castle after Gloucester's departure. The idea that Albany brought an army to rescue his brother appears in the brief chronicle written by the Jedburgh monk Adam Abell in the 1530s. The historian Norman Macdougall supposed the sixteenth century writers were influenced by later stories which praised the Albany Stewarts and notes an apparently pro-Albany appendix to a manuscript of Andrew of Wyntoun's chronicle which omits Gloucester's invasion in 1482.Macdougall, Norman, James III (1982), pp. 275–281, 314. Another early narrative, a 1492 Italian life of Margaret of Denmark, possibly informed by the recollections of a Scottish student at Bologna, merely states that James III was imprisoned for a time after a period of unsatisfactory rule with the consent of his wife and brother.Chandler, S. B., 'An Italian life of Margaret of Scotland' in Scottish Historical Review, vol.32 no.113 part 1 (April 1953), pp.52–57, by Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti. History which showed James III in a bad light and was positive about Albany may have been pleasing to the courtiers of James IV and Albany's son, John, Regent Albany. Macdougall calls this effect the \\"Albany legend,\\" which combined with the parliamentary record published by Robert Lekprevik in 1566 shaped the writings of these historians in the 1570s.Macdougall, Norman, James III, (1982), 283. Other records such as the valuable \\"golden charter\\" on 16 November 1482 by which James III rewarded the town of Edinburgh with the customs duties of Leith contributed to this legend. The charter recorded the loyal and hearty services of the whole community of Edinburgh and Albany in freeing him from Edinburgh castle.Extracts form the Records of Edinburgh, 1403–1528 (Edinburgh, 1869). John Lesley, who knew of Alexander's pretension to be king in 1482, has Gloucester take Berwick on his return to England after vigorous defence by Sir Patrick Hepburn of Dunsyre, Lord Hailes, and significant English casualties. An addition to the English Croyland Chronicle also records that Berwick Castle was taken by Gloucester on his return after \\"vast slaughter and bloodshed,\\" a phrase similar to that used by Edward IV in his letter to the Pope.Riley, Henry, ed., Ingulph's chronicle of the abbey of Croyland, Bohn, London (1854), p.481 George Buchanan has Albany at Lennoxlove camped with the English army in August and reconciled by the negotiation of Colin Campbell, Earl of Argyll, the Chancellor Andrew Stewart, and the Bishops of St Andrews and Dunblane. On 26 August, according to Buchanan, Berwick Castle, still held by Scotland separately from the town, was surrendered by negotiation in Edinburgh to England.Leslie, John, The History of Scotland (Bannatyne Club, 1830), pp. 49–50: Buchanan, George, History of Scotland, book 12, chap.49, various editions. The English writer Raphael Holinshed, who used Lesley as a source, understood that James III had gone to Lauder Bridge to meet his brother's invasion. He has Lord Stanley and Sir John Elrington, (the English war treasurer), holding Berwick town while Gloucester went forward to Edinburgh and camped at Restalrig and Lord Hailes defended Berwick Castle. Holinshed and Lesley mention an English navy in the Forth, not mentioned by other writers, although a record of its armament survives. Holinshed adds that after his reconciliation Albany sent an army south to aid Lord Hailes at Berwick which reached Lammermuir, and like Lesley simply says 24 August was the date that Patrick Hepburn yielded the castle, as Hepburn knew there was little hope of relief because of the dissension in Scotland.Holinshed, London (1586), p.282-283 see external links (use of Lesley is indicated in Holinshed's margins): Holinshed, The Scottish chronicle or, a complete history and description of Scotland Arbroath (1805), p.108-110: The 'Scots' Lesley (1830) has 24 August, Dalrymple's 1590s Scots Language translation of Lesley, and the 2nd Latin edition (1675) give the date 23 August; Cody, ed., vol.2 SHS (1895), 98; De origine moribus, (1675), p.310: the appointment of the naval commander is in Foedera, vol.5 part 2 (Hague, 1741), =The English chronicles: Hall (1542), Grafton (1569), Stow (1580)= The English chronicle of John Stow first published in 1580 adds more details. Edward IV, says Stow, invaded Scotland at Albany's request, \\"forgetting his oath,\\" and borrowing £5,000 from the City of London. The sum is less than the 8,000 marks or £5,333 of Cecilia's dowry received by James III.Macdougall, Norman, James III (1982), p. 117. The army mustered at Alnwick at the start of July. There were three \\"battles\\" as mentioned in George Cely's newsletter. The vanguard was commanded by the Earl of Northumberland with Lord Scrope of Bolton, Sir John Middleton, Sir John Ditchfield, and 6,700 soldiers. Gloucester formed the middle section, with Albany, Francis Lovell, Lord Greystock, Sir Edward Woodville, and 5,800 men. Lord Neville followed with 3,000; Thomas, Lord Stanley on the right of the Duke with 4,000; Lord Fitzhugh, Sir William Parr and Sir James Harrington on the left with 2,000; while 1,000 men guarded the carriage of the ordnance. Stow and Richard Grafton called the keeper of Berwick Castle, Patrick Hepburn, \\"Earl of Bothwell,\\" a title he acquired in October 1488. As Hepburn would not yield the castle, 4,000 troops were left to besiege it with Stanley, Parr, and the household treasurer, Sir John Elrington. On the way to Edinburgh the army burnt numerous towns and castles. Edward Hall's earlier Chronicle published in 1542 supplied the battle order and gave a list of some forty places burned by Gloucester en route and other places burned by the Earl of Northumberland (who carried out a parallel campaign in the borders) agreeing in number with Cely's newsletter. Richard Grafton in his Chronicle at Large published in 1569 has the same detail of the army as Hall, but like Cely states 44 towns were burnt. Much of Grafton's chronicle is taken from directly from Hall but his deviations are sometimes of interest.Grafton, Richard, Grafton's Chronicle: The Chronicle at Large, 1569, vol.2 London (1809), p.73 Hall has nothing to say about Lauder, and wrote that James III voluntarily enclosed himself in Edinburgh Castle,Hall, Edward, (1809), 332. which coincides with the detail of Lord Darnley's secret contract. Stow says the Scottish army lay at Haddington, and Albany was reconciled with the lords much as described by George Buchanan, and made \\"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\\" an appointment made or renewed in December. Edward Hall and John Lesley wrote that Albany mustered the Scottish army at Cranshaws Castle in the Lammermuir Hills to save Berwick Castle from his former allies Hall's Chronicle has the army entering Edinburgh without any destruction at Albany's request, and issuing a public proclamation for James III in the castle, while the Scottish lords and army were at Haddington. After the reconciliation, Hall describes an indenture made at the English camp at Lennoxlove (Lethington), just south of Haddington, on 3 August between Albany and Gloucester wherein Albany promised to deliver on his treaty at Fotheringhay despite his new agreement. Hall quotes the 4 August bond of the community of Edinburgh for the dowry repayment, Grafton has Albany direct the city of Edinburgh to make the bond after Berwick castle surrendered, but as in Hall, Grafton has the Garter Herald King at Arms return to Edinburgh on 23 October to request payment on the 4 August bond. The date is nearly correct; Edward IV decided to abandon the marriage plan and redeem the bond and the Garter herald John Writhe came to Edinburgh on 26 October. On the herald's return Duke of Gloucester withdrew from Newcastle to Sheriff Hutton. Hall and Grafton continue that Albany only now let James III out of the Castle, after having previously besieged him there, though records show James III was released earlier.Grafton, vol. 2 (1809), 76–77: Hall, (1809), 336: Macdougall, Norman (1982), p.169: (the sequence fits the letters to Lord Darnley in Lennox Book, vol.2) Soon after 4 August, in Hall's Chronicle, as in Holinshed and Lesley, as \\"Lieutenant-General of Scotland,\\" Albany summoned the army to relieve Berwick Castle to meet on 8 August at Cranshaws on the way to Duns, but told Gloucester it was a pretence. Gloucester declared that if Albany opposed him at Berwick, he would defend the besiegers or die in the attempt.Grafton, vol.2, (1809), 75. However, the council of Scotland was reluctant to fight and instead drafted a surrender of Berwick Castle by treaty in Edinburgh on 24 August. When the document was sealed by both parties, which would be a couple of days later as Gloucester was now at Berwick or Alnwick, Berwick Castle was delivered straightaway, \\"incontinent,\\" to Lord Stanley.Hall, Edward (1809), p.334. It is possible either that the castle fell to Stanley before Albany's negotiations with the council were completed and agreed by Gloucester, as Edward IV's letter to the Pope may suggest, or that Edward IV anticipated the castle would be taken by force when he wrote. The Earl of Northumberland knighted his commanders at the mains of Cessford Castle on 22 August 1480 or 1482 Hall's 1542 chronicle, compiled using English historical materials, may be less affected by the \\"Albany legend\\" than the Scottish accounts and certainly shows Albany acting with duplicity, yet he concludes these events of 1482 with a lamentation of Albany's eventual fate, comparable with the Duke of Clarence, caused by the \\"prime envy\\" of James III against \\"his brother, the only organ and instrument by whom he obtained liberty and freedom,\\" which seems at odds with his own account of the invasion.Hall, p. 338: Grafton, p. 78. Stow says when Berwick Castle was delivered to Stanley, Sir Thomas Molyneux of Haughton was knighted there as a banneret. Among the burnt places mentioned by Edward Hall, \\"Hooton\\" and \\"Heton Hall\\" must be the Hatton-Field, \\"Hoton feld besyde Berwyke\\" where Gloucester is said to have knighted Sir Ralph Assheton of Middleton as a banneret, and knighted Thomas, Lord Scrope of Masham and 26 others. These knights were made on 22 August, about the time of the surrender of Berwick Castle, and so Richard seems to have travelled back from Newcastle. The Earl of Northumberland is said to have knighted 18 men at the \\"mayne of Sefford,\\"Cessford in the Scottish Middle-march, during a previous campaign, on 22 August 1480, or at the same time. A grand total of 70 knights and bannerets including Molyneux and Edward Stanley were made on 24 August which seems to mark the end of hostilities.Burke, A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies, (1844) p.20 Assheton, 360 Molyneux: Metcalfe, Walter Charles, A book of Knights Banneret etc.,, London (1885), p.5-7, citing BL Cotton Ms. Claudius, c.iii, fol. 61–67: William Arthur Shaw, Book of Knights, vol.2 (1906), p. 20 includes knights made at Cessford in 1482. The occasion on the 22 August may have prompted Edward's letter to the Pope. Stow concludes with the Duke of Gloucester returned to Sheriff Hutton and Edward IV rewarding the Mayor of London, William \\"Harriot,\\" and some of aldermen of the city with a feast and hunting at Waltham Forest. The feast appears in other chronicles of Edward IV as an example of his princely largesse, not connected with the Scottish expedition: the city loan of 5000 marks but not the Scottish expedition is mentioned under the year 1482 in Fabyan's chronicle.Howes, Edmund, Annales, or, a Generall Chronicle of England begun by John Stow, London (1631/2), p.432: Ellis, Henry, ed., Fabyan's new chronicles of England and France, 1516, (1811), pp. 656–7. Stow's description of a city loan and reward are corroborated by surviving documents; Edward IV's Garter King of Arms gave the bond from Edinburgh to William Heryot, Mayor of London on 11 October 1482. Garter went to Edinburgh and contracted its payment with the city in the porch of St Giles' Church on 27 October 1482.Calendar Documents Scotland, pp. 304–5 no. 1481, exemplification of the Edinburgh bond, nos. 1482–4: Foedera, vol.12 (London, 1711), pp.164–5, 167.

Winters are cool and rainy, and while snow at sea level in Humboldt County is rare, light snowfall is typical several times a year in Kneeland because of the higher elevation. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Kneeland has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Kneeland, California History Humboldt County was occupied by several native groups of at least two language families prior to and after the European settlers arrived. The Wiyot people used the area around Kneeland for salmon and locally harvested roots as well as lamprey from the Eel River and other subsistence food items. They may have used fire to maintain the prairies around Kneeland for hunting. Estimates of California Indian populations prior to the whites vary widely, but there were about 1500 to 2000 Wiyot in the Humboldt region shortly before the arrival of the whites, however due to the Indian Island Massacre, other massacre events, Indian wars, introduced diseases, starvation and forced relocations, they numbered around 100 individuals. Today, many Wiyot live on the Table Bluff Reservation, located south of Eureka. The area around Kneeland was not settled by whites until after the California Gold Rush brought waves of new settlers to the region to supply inland gold miners. The area around Kneeland was originally known as Kleizer's Prairie, but in 1852 with the establishment of a ranch by John A. Kneeland and his sister Mandala, the area became known as Kneeland's Prairie.Cooper, Russell, Kneeland through the years, January 1987, Humboldt Historian, January/February 1987, Vol. 38 Issue 1, page 16 Other sources cite the name to Tom and John A. Kneeland, first American settlers there. As more settlers arrived, conflict with the Indians resulted in the establishment of two U.S. Army stations Camp Lyon (1862) and Camp Iaqua (1863), nearby and Army soldiers patrolled settler's ranches. Until the Homestead Act of 1862 permitted formal settlement, there were conflicts between settlers and squatters. The former small holders sold out in the 1870s and the land became consolidated into large ranches and at the turn of the century, these large ranches were owned by prominent local families. The first Kneeland school, which doubled as a meeting hall and a church, was built in 1869. Some stage hotels were built in the 1880s. The Kneeland post office operated from 1880 to 1891 and from 1892 to the present. After World War II commercial logging drove the local economy. A sawmill was built and in 1962 a small airport was built nearby for emergency landings for small planes since the other Humboldt County airports often become fog bound before Kneeland. The airport also provides facilities for CalFire. Economy Kneeland has no central downtown district, the new 1952 Kneeland Elementary School building, the Kneeland Airport, and the Kneeland Volunteer Fire Department in the community. The post office closed in 2014. Logging continues in the surrounding timber. Most of the ranches and the few houses past the post office and toward Bridgeville are also referred to as Kneeland. The cemetery is a from the post office. Memorial Day weekend brings a few of the locals out for a cleanup and get-together to commemorate the history of this small community.

The school was modernized in 1951, and again in the 1980s. Demographics According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the population of Kneeland was 244. The population was 51.6% female and 48.4% male. The median age of the population was 41.5, higher than the national median of 35.3. The population was 95.9% White, 1.6% Native American or Alaskan Native, 0.9% other races, and 1.6% identified with two or more races. Only 2.2% of the population was foreign born, and of those, 50.0% were born in Guatemala.

They extended the railroad up the North Fork Mad River, where they built the Humboldt Lumber Company sawmill in 1883 with a company town for worker housing. The sawmill was the first in Humboldt County to use a kiln for drying lumber. The town was originally called North Fork, but was renamed Korbel in 1891 with the arrival of the post office. The Korbel family sold their Mad River properties to the Northern Redwood Lumber Company in 1902. Rail passenger service ended in 1931. The sawmill closed in 1933, but was reopened in 1942. In 1956 Simpson Investment Company of Washington purchased the site. Rail connection with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad was abandoned in 1985. Sawmill operations have continued into the 21st century, but few residential or commercial structures remain. Simpson operations in Korbel were spun off to sister company Green Diamond Resources. The mill was sold to Trinity River Timber in 2016; Green Diamond continues to own timberland in the area.

The character made his first screen appearance on 18 May 2009. Harry departed on 11 June 2010 after accepting a Basketball scholarship in Sydney. Harry has been portrayed as having a unique persona, being a loner refusing to accept help from others and rebelling against those around him. The character has been involved in storylines including being orphaned, plots involving the Department of Human Services and his subsequent time in foster care. Moore revealed that some viewers became angry at some of the things Harry did during his time on the show. Character creation and casting In February 2009, it was announced that Neighbours producers were introducing a new generation of the Ramsay family to the show, more than a decade after the family had last appeared. Executive producer Susan Bower said the introduction of the new characters was based on the American drama series Party of Five. She added \\"We have three orphans, basically. That, as you can imagine, has a tremendous amount of story material with it and they're fabulous! Wait until you see this cast. They just clicked\\". Bower introduced the new characters despite the show receiving criticism because they did not have a nuclear or a \\"normal\\" family. Bower said that where she lives, in the suburbs, \\"there's not a lot of your mum, dad and two kids\\". Actress Ashleigh Brewer was cast as older sister Kate Ramsay. It was after this Will Moore was cast as Harry, and Kaiya Jones was cast as Sophie Ramsay, completing the family unit. Speaking of his character being part of the Ramsay family Moore said \\"At first I thought \\"Oh my God, am I supposed to do something special?\\" Everyone said \\"Your character's Harry Ramsay? Like Ramsay Street?\\" So I have those connections, but I got used to playing it after a while. It's pretty cool to be playing a part that has so much history and it's cool that we're related to so many of the original characters – Anne Robinson and Max Ramsay had an affair and had our mum.\\" In March 2010, it was announced that Moore and Harry were to leave Neighbours in June. Bower said that she was aware that viewers would be disappointed that one of the Ramsays was leaving already. She added \\"We were very saddened too, because we fell in love with Harry, but Will had a one-year contract and he decided he didn't want to continue. I believe he's furthering his school studies.\\" Bower also added that there were no plans to recast the role, because the character of Declan Napier had just been through a recast. Harry departed for a Basketball scholarship in Sydney on 11 June 2010. Character development Harry has been described as a loner, an outcast and unlucky in love. Speaking of his character during an interview with Last Broadcast, Moore said \\"Harry is a confused teenager trying to figure out who he is. He's a bit of a loner and doesn't have too many friends. He puts up a facade of confidence and toughness, but really underneath he is a sensitive dork. All he really wants is to be accepted and fit in, but nothing seems to work for him. He also finds it hard to score with girls.\\" Moore has also compared the character to himself commenting that he is a rebel. During an interview with Channel Five's soap opera reporting site, Holy Soap, Moore revealed an insight into his character and how his storylines have had a direct effect on his personality stating: Network Ten state on the series official website that Harry only has a close relationship with Kate. They call him a \\"shrewd judge of character\\" and he makes \\"whip-like observations\\" of everything. He has a \\"reflective soul.\\" Also describing him as an accomplished musician who meditates with music. Harry feels like he needs no one in his life but his sisters, playing a loner. He masks who he really is, a laid back character that tests everyone he meets fearing he cannot trust them, making harsh observations. They add he is hard to shock and likes children for their honesty and lack of guile which he applies to himself. They also state that due to his complex personality that other people think he is \\"aloof\\" and \\"withdrawn\\". Harry has never been popular with female characters featured in Neighbours, often messing up any chance of a relationship due to his bad nerves around females other than his sisters. He also finds it hard to bond with other females as he masks his true identity whilst making his harsh observations he applies to other characters. Moore said he felt bad for Harry and that it was time for him to find some love. He said \\"Harry's been a bit isolated just having his sisters. Unfortunately you're not going to see any romance with Harry at all. The character hasn't been kissed before, which is quite incredible. He hasn't really been with a girl before so it's a very nerve-wracking experience for him and he kind of screws those opportunities up.\\" StorylinesBackground= Harry is one of the Ramsay siblings who arrived in Erinsborough in 2009 following the death of their mother Jill Ramsay (Perri Cummings). Harry is the middle child and the only Ramsay boy, he is particularly close to Kate as she has been a mother figure to Harry. Harry has had to deal with a great deal already in his life and as a result he does not let others in easily. He is devoted to his two sisters and will do anything to ensure their safety and happiness. =2009–10= Despite finding out that Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) had not killed his mother, Harry still blamed Paul for taking her away from him. On his first day at Erinsborough High Harry met Declan Napier (James Sorensen) and Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) and he was unaware of Declan's connection to Paul. At the opening night of the school play, Kyle Canning tells Harry that Declan's mother Rebecca (Jane Hall) is Paul's girlfriend. Harry began a fight with Declan, which Dan Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker) interrupted. While helping out Bridget behind the scenes he found out she and Declan were a couple and asked her how Rebecca could stand by Paul. Declan appeared and another fight broke out between them, in which Harry was pushed off the stage. While Dan was telling them off, yet another fight broke out between them. They fell into a man holding a rope connected to some scenery, which crashed down on top of a Bridget. Harry later went to the hospital to see if Bridget and her unborn child were okay. Dan then gave Harry and Declan weekend detention. Harry later forgave Paul and he no longer blames him for his mother's death. During a jumble sale that Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) is holding, Harry sees a keyboard that he wants. He can't afford to buy it, but when it goes unsold, he breaks into the Kennedys' home to play it. When Susan discovers that Harry was the person who had broken into her home she asks him to play for her. During his time with Susan, Harry breaks down and cries when he plays Moonlight Sonata as it was his mother's favourite piece. After Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) was blamed for the death of Bridget, Harry spray paints \\"Guilty\\" in on her driveway. He is caught by an angry Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) who says he is going to the police, but Harry begs him not to. Toadie makes him apologise to Steph and work for her doing jobs around the house. At first he was sullen and rude to Steph, but when he realised how upset she was about the accident they reconciled. In the buildup to the Deb Ball, Harry was manipulated into buying alcohol by Amanda Fowler (Bella Heathcote). After smuggling the alcohol into the school and hiding it in a locker, it was discovered by Dan. Harry tried to pin the blame on Declan, but he later admitted that the bottle was his and he was suspended from Erinsborough High. As a result, Roz Challis (Janet Watson Kruse) from the DHS is forced to intervene with the Ramsay family's living arrangements and she rules that Harry is failing to adapt to his new life style and he is taken into foster care. Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) then offered to become the legal guardian of the Ramsay's and Paul and Toadie helped to improve Lou's image and financial situation. Whilst he was in care, Harry was bullied and beaten by a boy at his foster home. When Lou discovered this, he made Harry come back to Ramsay Street and was almost arrested for kidnapping Harry. Roz assures Lou that the situation was now sorted and Harry had to return to his foster home. The DHS eventually agreed to Lou becoming the Ramsay's guardian and when the paperwork came through, Harry was allowed to return home. Lou moved in with the family shortly afterwards. Harry displays a natural talent for basketball and his cousin Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) encourages his ambition to play for school team. Scott Griffin, (Eamonn George), a school bully who is jealous of Harry's talent, tried to stop Harry from attending tryouts by intimidating and threatening him. Harry, with the support of his family, Andrew and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) decided to ignore Griffo and successfully tried out for team. Harry and Andrew both begin to compete to win Summer's affection and, after helping Summer out with her grandmother's love life, they share a kiss. However, Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) tells Summer about Harry and Andrew's competition. Summer later tells Harry and Andrew that she does not want to be friends with them for them treating her like an object. Harry and Andrew decide to work together to regain Summer's friendship and she eventually forgives them until she gets into a fight with Natasha over her interfering with her friends and she realises how they have turned her into someone she doesn't want to be and so tells them she can't be their friend anymore. Harry grows jealous when he finds out that Summer is dating Chris Pappas (James Mason), but he eventually makes up with Summer. Sophie applies to the National Basketball Academy on Harry's behalf, as she knows he will not do it himself. Harry is then chosen to try out in front of Andrew Gaze. Harry is accepted into the academy and he struggles to tell Kate that he is going to be leaving for Sydney. Harry changes his mind about going after listening to Andrew, but Kate helps him out and convinces him that he has the courage to go. Harry then leaves for Sydney after saying goodbye to his friends and family. Reception The character of Harry has previously proved to outrage some viewers. Moore revealed that people had been angry at some of the stuff Harry had done. Moore said \\"They say 'How can you do this? You're such a horrible person.' I'm like 'Sorry.' Some people come up to me and say 'Did your mum really die?' And I'm like 'It's fictional!'\\".

The station contains research facilities and equipment, conducts undergraduate education and courses, and serves as center for conferences, symposia, and retreats. The Pyatuning Laboratory hosts researchers from the University of Pittsburgh as well as those from universities throughout the nation and world, which have included, among others, researchers form Duke University, the University of Virginia, the University of Georgia, the University of Miami. Likewise, course instructors at the lab come from the University of Pittsburgh, but also have included instructors from other institutions including Georgia Tech, the University of Connecticut, and the National Aviary. In addition, the University of Pittsburgh has instituted a collaborative program for study at the Pymatuning Lab with other area universities in which students that are enrolled through any of these institutions register, pay tuition, and receive credit at their home institutions. Schools participating in the collaborative program include Clarion University, Edinboro University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Slippery Rock University. History Canoeing near the lab The University of Pittsburgh established a biological field station at Presque Isle, Pennsylvania on the shores of Lake Erie in 1926. However, the creation of Presque Isle State Park crowded out the modest field station, and in 1949 the field station moved to Pymatuning State Park. The University of Pittsburgh obtained a lease from the state for a wooded peninsula adjacent to the Pennsylvania State Fish Hatchery which became known as the Sanctuary Lake Site. The first building was constructed on this site in 1952. Over time more research buildings were erected on the site in order to satisfy the educational and research needs of the University of Pittsburgh and visiting faculty and students from other colleges and universities in Western Pennsylvania. By 1965, the university had outgrown the Sanctuary Lake Site facilities and it obtained a second lease from the Pymatuning State Park for a dedicated housing site. As the Housing Site expanded and developed, the Sanctuary Lake Site was dedicated to maintaining modern research and teaching facilities. Today, this site has modern facilities for housing instructors, researchers, and students as well as a Dining Hall, Kitchen, and Recreation Hall. Major renovations and building projects were undertaken in the mid-1990s that resulted in a 30% increase in space and included the installation of numerous pieces of equipment and lab renovations. Among the projects was a new $81,000 administration building with a library and a $102,000 faculty housing unit that was completed in 1997. Since 2000, the University of Pittsburgh has renovated and expanded the facilities, as well as adding a significant increase in land. This has included the acquisition of three research properties, Wallace Woods, Beagle Road, and the Livingston Farm, that total . In addition, the university has constructed five additional labs. In addition, the lab has been awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to construct a new $1.2 million, laboratory building to be completed in 2014 that will contain three new research labs including new animal care space for bird researches and sterile lab space for molecular and microbial biology. This facility will also be open to K-12 public school students when the universities are on hiatus. Facilities right The lab and teaching facilities of the Pymatuning Laboratory are located within public lands consisting of an Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation area owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In addition, the Pymatuning Laboratory owns 360 acres of research sites that includes tracts of forest, successional field, and wetland along Linesville Creek in the Pymatuning watershed, and another tract of successional meadow, designated for experimental plantings and manipulations, a few miles from the laboratory site. An old-growth forest preserve of the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy also is managed by the Lab. Facilities include 10 research labs, cabins, dormitories, a dining hall, and lecture rooms. The lab is also stocked with a variety of equipment for research as well as recreational purposes. =Sanctuary Lake Site= Lab buildings at the Sanctuary Lake Site The Sanctuary Lake Site is the original research site for the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology since 1949 and is situated on Sanctuary Lake, a protected waterway, which several of the original classrooms overlook.

Barontius (Barontus) (, ) and Desiderius (, ) were two 8th century hermits who are venerated as saints by the Catholic Church. They were hermits near Pistoia, in Italy. Barontius had been a Frankish nobleman of Berry who had, with his son, been a monk at Saint-Pierre de Longoret (Longoreto, Longoretum, Lonrey) (diocese of Bourges), now the monastery of Saint-Cyran-du-Jambot. Barontius was a former member of the court of Theuderic II. Visio Baronti Monachi Longoretensis According to the text known as Visio Baronti Monachi Longoretensis, a 4700-word long text dated 25 March 678 or 679 purportedly written by Barontius himself, Barontius received a vision of heaven and hell around 678.Caroline Walker Bynum, Paul H. Freedman, Last things: death and the Apocalypse in the Middle Ages (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000), 54. Barontius, described by one scholar as “a middle-aged former public servant with three marriages and far too many mistresses on his conscience,” claims that he fell into a coma and had a vision that he was flying through the air above the Bourges region as demons clawed and kicked at him. Accompanied by the archangel Raphael, Barontius journeys through the four levels of heaven, although he continues to be tormented by the demons, who want to pull him down to hell.Eileen Gardiner, Medieval visions of heaven and hell: a sourcebook (Published by Taylor & Francis, 1993), 43-44. Barontius meets people he has known, including fellow monks from Longoreto. Raphael asks another angel to bring Saint Peter to them, so that Peter can judge Barontius. The demons bring their evidence against Barontius, going “over all the sins that [Barontius] had committed from infancy onwards, including those which [he] had totally forgetten.” However, the demons get so annoying that Peter whacks them with his keys, sending them away. Peter then decides to send Barontius back to earth via hell, where Barontius sees all of the souls in torment before returning to earth. When he recovers, he is asked to tell of his vision. At Pistoia This vision led to Barontius' decision to become a hermit in Italy, and he established himself near Pistoia with Desiderius, also a former monk. They lived an austere life, and were joined by disciples. They died around 725 AD. Their names appear in the Martyrologium Romanum.

As a tax-exempt 501(c)3 grassroots bicycle advocacy organization, Bike East Bay endeavors to broaden awareness of bicycling with local, regional, and state government agencies and their staff, as well as elected officials, and the general public they represent. History The coalition was founded in 1972 Alexander Zuckermann, who was among the first to persuade BART to allow bicycles aboard its trains. Zuckerman also lobbied for bike access on the Richmond-San Rafael, Benicia (successfully) and Carquinez (successfully) bridges, among other accomplishments. The bike and pedestrian path on the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge was named for him. Membership The coalition now counts over 4000 dues-paying members, plus several thousand members of nineteen affiliated clubs and organizations that are part of the coalition. Current campaigns Bike East Bay is developing community liaisons for all 55 cities and municipalities in the East Bay, to include promoting the efforts of bicycle advisory committees in those municipalities; coordinating the annual Bike-to-Work Day in the East Bay; promoting bicycle access on all roads, at all facilities, and on all transit for both sides of the hills; improving BART access and parking; obtaining safe and convenient bicycle parking in downtown areas and other key destinations. Bike East Bay also watchdogs the spending of millions of dollars in transportation and strategic planning funds it has succeeded in allocating for bicycle facilities. Bike East Bay is currently engaged in joint efforts in Oakland with the East Bay's Cycles of Change organization to establish two Neighborhood Bicycle Centers (NBC's) to serve low income cyclists, one in East Oakland, and another in West Oakland. Other campaigns include bringing the Bay Area Bike Share program to the East Bay, guiding city bike plans in Berkeley, Concord, Moraga, Hayward and others, asking for more protected bikeways to be built and closing gaps in the bikeway network.https://bikeeastbay.org/campaigns OutreachBike to Work Day= In 1994, following joints efforts with the City of Oakland's Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee (BPAC), the coalition began celebrating Bike-to- Work Day with a free pancake breakfast at Oakland's City Hall Plaza. Today the event has become an annual celebration on a regional and national scale. In 2014 Bike to Work Day celebrated its 20th birthday. Bike East Bay counted close to 20,000 bike commuters on the day of and organized a pop-up protected bikeway on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland =Education= Bike East Bay strives to inform both bicyclists and motorists with its Bicycle Safety Quiz, which it has made available online, and in Chinese and Spanish. The organization also supports traffic safety classes in the East Bay which endeavor to educate cyclists on how to drive a bicycle safely and more effectively. The education program offers bike commuting workshops to employers and other groups that wish to foster bicycle commuting to work, errands, and play. =Maps and newsletters= The organization publishes two East Bay Bicycle Transportation Maps, one covering areas \\"East of the Hills\\" and another covering areas \\"West of the Hills,\\" which planners and activists have used as templates for municipal bike plans in the East Bay. Members are kept informed of advocacy issues with quarterly issues of \\"rideOn,\\" the coalition newsletter, each year. =Member meetings= The coalition holds General Membership Meetings at a variety of public venues in both counties to engage the energy and talents of its grassroots base. =Pedestrian, bicycling and transit-oriented planning advocacy= Bike East Bay has a long history of advocating for broad-based and sustainable transportation and land use planning solutions that also enhance the built environment for pedestrians, cycling and transit riders. The Bike East Bay website links to educational material and activists working toward bus rapid transit,http://www.bikeeastbay.org/brt better pedestrian safety and facilities, and smart growth =Valet bicycle parking= Bike East Bay and its vast volunteer network across two counties frequently offers free, secure, valet bicycle parking at cultural and civic events throughout the East Bay. Public policy accomplishmentsBicycle accommodation= The organization, and its diverse constituencies, have achieved numerous public policy accomplishments over the years in areas of state and local legislation and administrative regulation to include: helping secure $1 billion in funding for the Regional Bicycle Network included in MTC's T2035 Plan; bicycle access on BART trains, all Bay Area ferry services, all East Bay bus systems, as well as bicycle access on Golden Gate Transit buses across the Richmond-San Rafael bridge. Bike East Bay helped implement the Caltrans Bay Area Bridge Bicycle Shuttle and worked to pass Prop 116 funding for Amtrak's Bike-Friendly California Cars on Capitol and San Joaquin trains by 1990. Bike East Bay's calls for \\"Routine Accommodation\\" of bicyclists in all transportation projects were adopted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission a regional planning, financing, and funding government agency in the San Francisco Bay Area which coordinates the transit systems in the area's nine counties. =Transportation projects funding= In 2014, Bike East Bay campaigned to pass Measure BB, a re-authorization of the previous Measure B. Measure BB, passed November 2014 with 70% of votes, will generate nearly $8 billion over 30 years for essential transportation improvements in every city throughout Alameda County. Of that $8 billion, bikes will get over 10% to fund complete streets, bicycle infrastructure projects and program.

It is located on the Northwestern Pacific Railroad east-northeast of Redcrest, at an elevation of . Larabee only has seasonal access across the Eel River; alternatively there is a former lumber road through Larabee Ranch, and on through Pacific Lumber Company property, that connects to Shively Road approximately five miles northwest. This road is only open during the winter when the temporary summer bridge is washed away by the rain-engorged Eel River. History Larabee, a historic settlement and community from the 1800s through today, is named after an early pioneer rancher of the area, Henry P. Larrabee (1830-1906). Also known as Hank Larrabee, he was a 49er and a local rancher, and a militiaman in the Bald Hills War, believed to have been among the perpetrators in the Indian Island Massacre. The settlement that later developed near his ranch at its peak had a blacksmith shop, stable, general store, school house, and productive farms and orchards. When the Northwestern Pacific Railroad was constructed residents had more ready access to the rest of the county and points south. The community proper was largely untouched by the great floods of 1955 and 1964, given its elevation just out of reach of the Eel River. Today Larabee is a quiet settlement with a handful of residents, bypassed by 101 and on the track of an abandoned railroad. The Laribee post office operated from 1888 to 1891, and from 1892 to 1899. The Larabee post office operated from 1921 (having been transferred from Dinty) to 1943. Larabee has regular mail delivery but is within the Redcrest, California postal zip code.

The formal liaison began some time before the 1960s, with a single position named the 'legislative liaison'. This later became the 'legislative counsel'. In the 1960s, an actual office was created for this purpose - the Office of Legislative Counsel. In the 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ramped up its congressional-liaison staff to deal with the large number of investigations coming from the Congress. It was the era of the Rockefeller Commission, the Church Committee, and the Pike Committee, all of which requested large amounts of information from the agency. In the 1980s, there were several reorganizations and renaming of the office. Near the end of the 1980s, the office was renamed the Office of Congressional Affairs and has kept that name, as of 2009.Snider, The Agency and the Hill, Chapter 4 In the early 2000s (decade), the relationship became more intense, with debates about the Global war on terror and controversies surrounding it.

From 1836, the railway line only ran from Sunderland to Ryhope, a year later reaching Sherburn, and after another year stretching to Shincliffe. The original Sunderland terminus was at Town Moor, a station later described as being a building that \\"has never been much admired for its architecture, nor for its convenience and accommodation\\". At this stage, the railway was powered by rope hauling, until around 1857, when locomotives were first used. In 1858, a new Sunderland station was opened at Hendon, about 880 yards south of the original terminus, but, from 1879, passenger trains were diverted into a new Central station. 1893 saw the line reach Durham Elvet by way of a branch off before Shincliffe. The line started to see decline after World War I, and passenger services were stopped at the start of 1931, the only exceptions being specials used to ferry in visitors during the annual Durham Miners Gala. In 1953, the line saw its last ever train, a travelling circus from Europe. The station buildings at Durham Elvet were demolished in the mid-1960s. The line today The site of Durham Elvet station, near Whinney Hill, is now occupied by a student accommodation for the University of Durham.

It was a small single-seat biplane, intended to be an inexpensive aircraft for the amateur private pilot, and a small number were built before Austin abandoned aircraft production. Development and design In 1919, John Kenworthy, chief designer of the motor manufacturer Austin Motor Company, (who had built large numbers of aircraft under license during the First World War) designed a small single-seater light aircraft in order to cash in on an expected boom in private flying. The resulting aircraft, named the Austin Whippet, was a small single-seat biplane of mixed construction, with a fabric covered steel tube fuselage, and single-bay, folding wooden wings. The wings avoided the need for rigging wires by use of streamlined steel lift struts.Jackson 1974, p.89.Flight 15 July 1920, pp. 751-752. The first prototype, powered by a two- cylinder horizontally opposed engine,Flight 14 August 1919, pp.1076-1078. flew in 1919, receiving its Airworthiness Certificate in December that year. Production aircraft were powered by a six-cylinder Anzani air-cooled radial, and four more aircraft followed before Austin abandoned aircraft production in 1920, when it realised that the postwar depression was severely limiting aircraft sales.Gunston 2005, p.36.

Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the series for publication in North America. A sequel series, Franken Fran Frantic, began on February 19, 2019. Plot Fran is a girl created by Dr. Naomitsu Madaraki, the world's most famous surgeon. Originally intended to be his assistant, she has taken over his work and home while he is away. Her life is rather uneventful besides scientific research work until various medical cases begin falling into her lap, ranging from resurrection to aesthetic surgery. There is a fair amount of dark humor with nearly each story ending with Fran having created some sort of gruesome monstrosity or misfortune of and upon her patients, though usually she is seemingly content with the results due to her extreme life-preserving mindset. Continuity is often rather loose, as individual chapters rarely reference one another. Though recurring characters outside the main cast do exist, arc-based storylines are practically nonexistent. =Finale= The final chapter, entitled \\"Dream\\", was published as \\"Episode\\" 61 of the manga. Notably, the chapter features no elements of the \\"typical\\" Franken Fran formula. Instead, most of the chapter consists of Fran being trapped on a sunken ship beneath the ocean, where oxygen deprivation soon leads her to experience a surreal dream - Okita, now a normal human, is her brother, Veronica is no longer a bio-weapon, etc. The dream culminates in an enormous party, which every character to have ever appeared in the manga attends. The \\"party\\" then (from the reader's point of view) concludes just as the most important guest - Dr. Madaraki - arrives, a tearful Fran throwing open the door to welcome him in. In the real world, Okita and Veronica manage to find the sunken ship, and spot the unconscious Fran through one of the portholes. They knock on the porthole, trying to rouse Fran with words. The final page of the manga shows Fran back at the Madaraki estate, plowing through a standard day of work. Franken Fran Frantic follows the events of this final chapter and resumes the episodic nature of its predecessor series.  Characters  ; The protagonist of the manga, Fran lives at the Madaraki estate. Though she is often mistaken for Naomitsu Madaraki's daughter, she is actually his greatest \\"masterpiece.\\" She is fitted with two sizable bolts upon her temples and marred with faint stitches, giving her a distinctly inhuman appearance. She has a unique view of morality, finding certain cases emotionally moving and experimenting out of the goodness of her heart. While most often aloof, she has shown that she is aware that her actions ruin lives, and is very capable of using her talents to punish others, should they seriously offend her or hurt others, such is the case with a group of spies sent to steal her and Dr. Amatsuka's secrets and research. Fran is able to make her clients' dreams come true and very often their nightmares as well - the consequences of her actions are extraordinary. Even so, Fran carries on without a concern. Though Fran is usually completely analytical and logical in her approach to cases, prioritizing the advancement of science and medicine for the overall benefit of humanity over traditional moral values, she has a soft spot for cases involving romantic affection. During surgery, she is able to increase the number of her arms and operate at a greater speed. Her one oath is to never take life, believing that \\"regardless of the shape or form, if it can function as a living organism, it is good.\\" ; Veronica is a bio-weapon assassin crafted by Dr. Madaraki for his own protection. As such, she is notably violent, though bound to a humane battle etiquette and creed: \\"to murder while causing as little suffering as possible\\" and \\"rather a painless death than a painful life.\\" In addition to her naturally high combat ability, she is trained in the handling of explosives and the setting of traps in the field. Wielding a huge guillotine blade in her right arm and a sharp sword in her left, she also appears to have needles on the ends of her fingertips which allow her to inject viruses into her victims. She has an X-shaped stitching across her face and a fairly benign, young appearance. Although her first appearance is as somewhat of an antagonist, she quickly joins Fran at her home and resumes her guard duties with Fran as a charge. She does not hesitate to eliminate anything that threatens the estate, though is usually rebuffed. As she was created after Fran, Veronica regards her as an older sister, calling her \\"onee-sama.\\" ; Fran's and Veronica's older sister and one of Naomitsu's earliest and most dangerous projects. Gavrill has the appearance of a woman in her twenties or late teens with wild, unkempt violet hair, a line of stitching going across the bridge of her nose, and black leather clothing adorned with various arm and leg braces she presumably wears as accessories. She is what Fran calls a \\"Transformer,\\" the entirety of her skeletal, muscular, organ, and nervous systems being partitioned into many smaller divisions so that she can consciously control them, which grants her the ability to manipulate her body and formidable regeneration. This suits her incredibly violent, often self- serving needs; her primary combat form being a humanoid wolf (giving her the nickname Gavrill the Wolf). However, Fran says that transformations require a great amount of willpower. As a result, the Professor has abandoned the practice due to the danger that comes with it if the subject's will is not strong enough. She, too, is introduced as an antagonist, casually mutilating Veronica in an attempt to lure Fran. Despite her foul mouth and exceptionally violent behaviour, she is loyal to Dr. Amatsuka, vowing to murder all of his attackers and proves to be a surprisingly adept confidant during her tenure of teaching at Fran's school on Amatsuka's request. Her hatred towards Dr. Madaraki and her \\"sisters\\" may stem from his abandoning the Transformer practice, abandoning her in turn. In Franken Fran Frantic, it is implied that Gavrill had been going to Dr. Amatsuka for her body tunings due to her legitimately caring for his company and well-being, despite her vulgar and insulting language towards him. ; The creator of Fran and her \\"siblings.\\" An unseen character, he owns the mansion that Fran lives in but has not lived there for a long time. During the second World War, Naomitsu worked for the Biochemistry Division, earning fame and the moniker of \\"Devil of Biology\\" and \\"Spider's Thread\\" due to the nature of his experiments. He is considered a top-class thinker in the field of biotechnology. Given his service in the war, he is presumed quite old, constantly traveling the world for the sake of his research. His current whereabouts are unknown to Fran. Dr. Madaraki defines World War II to be \\"a war to kill the gods\\" because of its promotion of scientific development and the erosion of religion accompanied by it. ; A friend of Madaraki's since the days of the old Japanese Empire, his various achievements have earned him the title of Viscount in England. He has an open bet with Madaraki on the existence of God. Amatsuka is also the one responsible for Gavrill's check-ups in order to keep her superhuman abilities stable. Fran is shown to hold a great deal of reverence towards Amatsuka and his contributions to humanity, and even Gavrill appears to show some respect for him despite the fact that Gavrill constantly badmouths him for his age and his cautionary warnings towards her. He is later assaulted by a group of agents who are hired by corrupt politicians. However, Fran is able to save his life with immediate treatment. When Gavrill finds out that Amatsuka was attacked, she vows revenge against the politicians responsible. ; A bespectacled female investigator who has the occasional interaction with the Madarakis, much to her terror. She first meets Fran in order to get help in tracking down a possible murderer; the second she undergoes surgery in order to heighten her senses and eliminate the clones of one of Fran's previous experiments, though this may be a stress-induced nightmare following her interaction with Fran. After isolating Gavrill on an island, Rumiko was cloned and genetically coded to undergo a form of mitosis, creating an endless force. She is also used as a base for Fran's artificial humans and was constantly cloned. She had also attracted a rich island owner Matsumae Tadashi. ; One of Fran's engineered companions, Okita has the head of a handsome young man with the body of a cat. He works along with Fran, supporting or making fun of her. Outside of the estate, his head is grafted onto a human body, taking the guise of a perfectly normal adult man. He is sometimes bewildered by Fran, but in general he supervises her actions in silence. He most often serves as the voice of reason amongst the group. ; Another of Fran's companions, she serves as a flexible reserve of organs. Stock is collected through her \\"face\\", which when not concealed with her full-body bandaging, is nothing more than hundreds of tentacles used to tear and collect reagents from the patient before death, keeping them fresh and viable. They are accessible via zippers in her skin. Her origin is revealed in an extra chapter; originally a beautiful, though terminally ill girl, she had a handsome lover in a similar condition. Due to their love for each other, they agreed to give each other their organs upon death, so that the other could live, but the man went back on his word, and took all of Adorea's organs for himself. Dr. Naomitsu Madaraki, the surgeon in charge at the time, modified Adorea into her present condition so she could reclaim her organs with interest.

It is an arrangement of twenty-two Corinthian columns which were a part of the United States Capitol from 1828 to 1958, placed amid of open meadow, known as the Ellipse Meadow. Original use The columns were quarried from sandstone near Aquia Creek in Virginia and transported to Washington on a barge. Old identification marks from the quarry are still visible on some of the stones. They were originally built as part of the east portico of the Capitol in 1828, long before the familiar Capitol dome was completed. However, when the dome was completed in 1866, it appeared inadequately supported by the columns, because the iron dome was significantly larger than the dome that the designer envisioned. To correct this visual illusion, an addition to the east side of the Capitol was constructed in 1958 and the columns were removed. Transfer to Arboretum The National Capitol Columns During the 1980s, Arboretum benefactor Ethel Garrett took up the cause of establishing a permanent home for the columns. Russell Page, a landscape designer and close friend of Garrett's, visited the Arboretum in September 1984, only months before his death. He determined that the east side of the Ellipse Meadow would be an ideal location, as the columns would be in scale with the more than of open meadow available at the site. The columns were relocated to this site, and set on a foundation of stones from the steps that were originally on the east side of the Capitol. A reflecting pool, fed by a small rivulet of water running down a channel in the steps, reflects the columns and provides sound and movement. A capital, or top portion, of one of the columns is located elsewhere in the meadow, so that visitors can see the detail that the stone carver incorporated into the design. Acanthus leaves are clearly visible, and the many layers of paint applied while the column was in place at the Capitol are visible on portions of the stone. The two missing columns One of the missing columns Only 22 of the original 24 columns stand in the Ellipse Meadow.

Early life and career He was born in a middle class Slovene family in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today in Italy). He attended private Slovene language schools in Trieste. As a teenager, he attended an intensive English course at the local Berlitz language school, where he was a pupil of the Irish novelist James Joyce.Richard Ellmann, James Joyce (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), p. 341Marta Verginella, Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36 After finishing the German language State gymnasium in Trieste in 1913, he went to study law at the University of Paris.Marta Verginella, Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36 After the break of World War I, he returned to Austria-Hungary, and enrolled in the University of Vienna. He finished his studies at the University of Bologna after the end of World War I. In 1920, he obtained a PhD from the University of Zagreb. In 1920, Furlan returned to his home city of Trieste, which had become a part of the Kingdom of Italy. First, he worked as an assistant in the Josip Wilfan's law firm, establishing his own practice in 1925. In 1926, when Fascist Italianization was already in full advance, he managed to get a permit to publish a Slovene-language legal journal named Pravni vestnik (The Legal Herald), in which both Furlan and Wilfan published numerous text on legal philosophy and legal theory.Marta Verginella, Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 37 The journal was abolished in 1928, as one of the last Slovene-language and Croat-language media prohibited by the Fascist regime. Between 1928 and 1930, Furlan worked as political advisor to Wilfan, who became one of the leaders of the Congress of European Nationalities.www2.arnes.si In 1930, he escaped to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in order to escape Fascist persecution. In 1931, he opened a law practice in Ljubljana, and in 1936 he became a professor of sociology of law at the University of Ljubljana. Exile during World War II In late March 1941, when Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, Furlan was evacuated from the country with the help of the British intelligence service with which he had established a collaboration.www.rtvslo.si After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the Italian occupation of Slovenia, he was convicted to death in contumaciam by the Italian authorities. After a short stay in Palestine, Furlan travelled to the United States. Together with the liberal conservative Slovenian émigré politicians Izidor Cankar and Franc Snoj, Furlan propagated for the Yugoslav and Slovene cause. In 1942, he published a brochure titled Fighting Yugoslavia: The Struggle of the Slovenes, in which he articulated, among other, the Slovenian claims for the annexation of his native Julian March region to Yugoslavia. In 1943, he moved to London, where he served as Minister of Education in the exile government of Miloš Trifunović between June and August 1943. In the first years of the war, Furlan supported the Chetnik resistance movement of Draža Mihajlović, but after early 1944, he became supportive of Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans. After the Yugoslav Prime Minister Ivan Šubašić recognized the partisan movement in June 1944, Furlan replaced Alojzij Kuhar as the official Slovene speaker of the Yugoslav government in exile for the Radio London. In summer 1944, he had several speeches directed to the members of the collaborationist Slovene Home Guard, urging them to join forces with the partisan forces. One of his speeches, titled A Clear Word from London was printed on leaflets which were dropped by Allied airplanes over Slovenia. In Autumn 1944, Furlan replaced Izidor Cankar as Minister for Culture and Telecommunication in the Provisional Government. In early 1945, he went to the liberated territories in southern Slovenia together with Franc Snoj. Under the Communist regime After the end of World War II, he became the dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana. He tried to maintain a critical attitude towards the Communist regime; among other things, he secretly translated George Orwell's Animal Farm.\\"Razprava pred Okrožnim sodiščem v Ljubljani proti vohunski skupini: Nagode, Snoj, Furlan.\\" 1947.

Furlan was accused of having been member of a Masonic lodge in the 1930s, of having maintained contacts with the British intelligence since the late 1930s; the main accusation regarded his translation of Orwell's Animal Farm and his friendly relations with the American Red Cross official Jack Hoptner.Marta Verginella, Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 123 In August 1947, he was sentenced to death.\\"Komentarji.

Plot  Nate (Mickey Rourke), a small-time jazz musician and recovering heroin addict, is clearly a hard-luck case. After a performance one night, he is mugged and bound. He awakens to find himself in a vehicle and being driven out into the desert, but he is helpless to do anything about it. His assailant then walks Nate away from the car and is about to kill him, but instead the assailant is shot dead by a band of Native Americans, and Nate is left unharmed. Nate wanders around in the desert and climbs a mountain, where he looks down upon a carnival and sideshow. He walks through the carnival, and asks the owner to use a telephone, and he wanders among the fire eaters, sword swallowers, and other performers. Nate finds himself drawn to the exotic beauty of Lily (Megan Fox), a freak performer who has wings on her back. Lily is cold and dismissive, but it dawns on her that this gentle giant may well be her ticket to a better life. The sideshow owner (Rhys Ifans) attempts to kill Nate, but Lily rescues him by stealing a truck, and together they flee to the city. Nate and Lily begin to form a relationship. Nate, fearing another assassination attempt, seeks out Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), a gangster with deep pockets who had ordered Nate killed after Nate had slept with his wife, whom Happy also had murdered. Nate plans to put Lily on display for paying customers, and he offers Happy 75 percent of the proceeds. Happy dismisses the proposal and does not believe Lily has wings, but he later sees for himself, when Nate arranges an appearance of Lily for him, but at a safe distance. Nate and Lily go to a motel, talk, and then have sex. Happy finds them and then abducts Lily, but to keep Lily compliant, he agrees not to harm Nate so long as Lily lives with him. Nate tries to stay away from Lily, but he realizes he is in love with her. When Nate attempts to see Lily and rescue her from Happy, he fails. By now, the sideshow owner has also learned that Lily is with Happy, and he breaks in and attempts to take her. Happy pulls out a pistol and shoots him to death. Later, Nate discovers that Happy is showcasing Lily in a theater, and again Nate goes to rescue her. He smashes the glass case in which Lily is being confined, and together they run to the top of the building, chased by Happy's men. Nate tries to convince Lily to fly away, but Lily lacks confidence in her ability to fly. Nate then jumps off the building, and Lily jumps after him, discovering that she can indeed fly. She catches Nate before he hits the ground, and together they fly off into the desert. Nate looks down on the ground below as they are flying and sees his own corpse at the spot in the desert where the Native Americans had shot his assailant, suggesting that everything that happened from that point forward was actually a dying dream. He is last seen being carried away by Lily into the sky.

It was first published in 1983 and has since been included in a single book with Fox's Feud and in the \\"Omnibus\\" edition (Hutchinson, 1994) with Fox's Feud and In the Grip of Winter. Plot summary Having left White Deer Park after the defeat of Scarface, Bold is exploring his new surroundings which he refers to as \\"the real world\\". He sees a magpie, which criticises him for being out during the daytime and feeding off scraps that many smaller animals would be grateful for, instead of hunting for his own food. Next he encounters a carrion crow who warns him that humans could be about. Bold ignores this warning as he sees nothing to fear from humans and in the following days he encounters several humans who do no harm to him at all, which increases his confidence. A few weeks later, Bold discovers a game wood on some farmland and develops a taste for game birds (mainly partridges and pheasants). He sleeps in a badger set, but its owner soon arrives and wakes him up. Bold is friendly towards this female badger and she warns him about the humans in the area. Bold ignores this warning too and upon coming across a collection of animals killed by the gamekeeper kills and eats a bird in front of it as an act of defiance. However, a few days later he discovers the female badger in a snare. Though he manages to save her by biting through a wire, this wire snaps back and injures his eye. The badger is grateful and offers to help Bold whenever he may need her. One day, Bold hears the sound of gunfire and discovers he has been caught in a pheasant shoot. When a dog comes towards him to get a dead pheasant, he tries to run away but runs towards the hunters because his bad eye prevents him from seeing them. One of the hunters then shoots him through the leg. Bold limps across the field with his injured leg dragging along the ground and eventually reaches a ditch where he is out of sight. Bold sees a dormouse nearby and tries to catch it, but is no longer nimble enough. Bold is unable to move far from the ditch and his diet consists mainly of slugs and insects he can find nearby. Unfortunately, those do not provide enough sustenance and Bold becomes very weak. He is found by the crow he met previously and Bold asks the bird for help, but the crow refuses until Bold tells him that his father is the famous Farthing Wood Fox. After this, the crow agrees to help him and heads off to find the badger that Bold helped. She eventually arrives with three of her kin and they feed Bold. One of the badger's offspring suggests that Bold should return to their set until he recovers. A few days later, Bold prepares to travel back to the game wood with the female badger, whom he has decided to call Shadow because she constantly watches over him. Due to Bold's injury they travel very slowly and when Shadow goes hunting Bold decides to leave as he do not want to be dependent on others. He finds an abandoned earth containing the remains of another fox's catches, which he gratefully devours. The next day he tries to catch a vole but has no success. He then resolves to live by raiding the food supplies of humans as revenge for his injuries. The next day, Bold travels to a nearby farm and comes across a pair of bantams which have been allowed to make their nest in the open. They notice the young fox and escape, but Bold is able to eat the eggs that they have abandoned in their nest. He returns to the farm a few days later and catches one of the bantams (it runs towards him after being startled). While taking it back to his earth, he meets Shadow again in a Swede field. Bold does not want to talk to her as he does not want to share the bantam but Shadows see him. Despite offering part of the bantam Shadow insists that Bold has all of it. Bold returns to the farm the next evening but the remaining bantam has been locked away and the farm dog sees him, forcing Bold to escape. Two humans use their terrier to track down Bold and dig up his earth, but when they see his weakened state they assume he cannot be the culprit and that his mate must have killed the bantam. Assuming Bold will not survive the winter they leave him alone. Bold again meets the crow, who suggests that he scavenge for food in a nearby town. It takes Bold several days to arrive, but when he does the two friends agree to collect food for each other in their scavenging. The crow is the first to look for food and after telling Bold that he has eaten some food left out for a dog or cat Bold decides to call him Robber. As Bold is injured he cannot jump over fences meaning he cannot get into most gardens, so his scavenging is limited. One evening while scavenging Bold sees a vixen in one of the gardens, but she completely ignores him and Bold feels humiliated. Several days later Bold sees the vixen in the garden once more and tries to dig his way in but she comes out to greet him. She tell Bold she moved into this town during the winter because food is more plentiful and offers to help him hunt but Bold's pride causes him to reject her offer. The vixen sees Bold again a month later and tells him she wants to hunt with him, and this time Bold does not refuse. Together they catch some rats and Bold calls her Whisper because of her stealth. Whisper offers to let Bold stay in her earth, but he goes back to his usual home to give one of the rats to Robber. When Bold tells Robber about Whisper, the crow insists that his friend forget their agreement and go to live in the vixen's earth, which Bold does the following night. Bold is unable to jump the wall to get in, but they find a hole through which he can enter. In the earth Whisper mistakes Bold for a much older fox and asks where he was born. Bold tells her he was born in White Deer Park and that his father is the famous Farthing Wood Fox, and Whisper makes a plan which Bold knows nothing of. A few days later they come across a large dog who barks loudly outside their earth. One day Bold cannot get back into the earth because the wall has been mended and the dog pursues him, so Bold hastily tries to make a new hole but gets stuck. Robber comes to his rescue but the dog turns out to be friendly and he helps Bold to make the hole in the wall big enough for him to get through. The dog, a mastiff, tells them his name is Rollo and that he is very lonely during the day as his master has left him nothing to play with. He visits the foxes frequently during the day in the ensuing weeks, even though the foxes are trying to sleep during the day. As mating season arrives the two foxes mate and Whisper is soon carrying Bold's cubs. Whisper tells Bold that she choose him as her mate because he was a cub of the Farthing Fox and she wants their cubs to be born in White Deer Park. Bold is crushed by this but he reluctantly agrees to lead her there. The foxes are fed for their last few days in the town by Rollo, and they head off back towards the country. Heavy snow makes travelling difficult for Bold, so their pace is very slow. Whisper wants to speed up but traveling through the slush exhausts Bold and he collapses on open land. He insists that Whisper go to find cover while he rests. Robber, who has been tracking their journey, discovers Bold on the ground and promises to bring Bold some food. Robber heads back to Rollo, who agrees to bring a bone he has buried to Bold and Whisper. While waiting, Bold digs himself into the snow to hide himself. However, two men with two greyhounds are chasing a hare. One greyhound kills the hare, the other chases Bold. Fortunately, Robber arrives and distracts the greyhound until Rollo gets there. Rollo then grabs the greyhound by the neck, shakes it, and casts it away. Rollo brings the foxes his bone and the hare killed by the other greyhound before heading back home to his master. As the foxes approach White Deer Park, Bold leaves Whisper while she is sleeping and hides himself away, forcing her to finish the journey alone. She arrives at the reserve and meets Charmer, who immediately tells her family of Bold's return. Meanwhile, Robber has noticed Bold go into hiding and offers to feed him, but the injured fox wants to wait for his death. Robber notices Fox and Friendly searching outside the park and leads them to Bold, joining up with Vixen and Charmer along the way. The foxes arrive and Fox tells Bold how proud he is, before the young fox passes away.

Origin  Sandrone, is represented as a peasant who is crude, clever, and cunning. He is seen as the spokesman of a humble people who are ill-treated, eternally hungry, and always using tricks to make ends meet. The character of his wife, Pulonia, appears in 1840, soon followed by a son Sgorghiguelo. The three form what is known as the Pavironica family. Initially, these characters were presented as puppets. Beginning in the late 19th century the three were represented by male actors known as \\"the Pulonia\\". Dressed in a style of clothing popular around 1700, Sandrone sports a corduroy jacket, short corduroy pants, red and white cross-striped socks, a floral embroidered vest, and sturdy farmer's boots. He also wears a wig with long hair, partly covered by a white wool nightcap ending in a tassel. His son (Sgorghiguelo) wears a wig and a reddish-brown cap with a visor. His wife (Pulonia) wears a white hat and an ankle length dress decorated with brightly colored flowers. She may also wear a white apron, black patent leather shoes with bright buckles, and a white wig with ringlets. For over a century these three characters have been a symbol of Carnival in Modena. The tradition is kept alive by the Society of Sandrone. Every year, on the Thursday before Lent, Sandrone and his family arrive at the train station from the imaginary village of Bosco di Sotto (\\"Lower Wood\\"). From there, they parade to Piazza Grande where the crowd witnesses the traditional \\"sproloquio,\\" a speech spoken in traditional Modenese dialect by the three from the balcony of Palazzo Comunale. The speech includes witty comments on city life and humorous criticism of local authorities.

It featured a number of popular musical acts from the 1950s and 1960s.Toronto Rock & Roll Revival Promotional Handbill ; www.wolfgangsvault.com. The festival is particularly notable as featuring an appearance by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, as the Plastic Ono Band, which resulted in the release of their Live Peace in Toronto 1969 album. The festival was also the subject of the D.A. Pennebaker film, Sweet Toronto.  History and performers  The Toronto Rock and Roll Revival was held at Varsity Stadium, at the University of Toronto, before an audience of over 20,000. The originally listed performers for the festival were Whiskey Howl, Bo Diddley, Chicago, Junior Walker and the All Stars, Tony Joe White, Alice Cooper, Chuck Berry, Cat Mother and the All Night News Boys, Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent, Little Richard, Doug Kershaw, and The Doors. Kim Fowley was listed as the Master of Ceremonies.Fowley was also at the time Gene Vincent's record producer. See Harvey Kubernick, Kim Fowley: John Lennon's Toronto Revival Interview with Kim Fowley, April 10, 2009; www.sonicboomers.com. Screaming Lord Sutch was later added to the bill, as was the Toronto area band FLAPPING. Prior to the addition of FLAPPING, the only local band on the bill was Whiskey Howl. The appearance of John Lennon, Yoko Ono and The Plastic Ono Band was not publicly known in advance. Various mutually supportive performances occurred at the festival. The Alice Cooper Band was the backing band for Gene Vincent,Uncredited, Toronto '69; www.sickthingsuk.co.uk. while a member of FLAPPING, Ron Marinelli, Danny Taylor, and Hugh Leggat a member of Nucleus, were members of the backing band for Chuck Berry.See \\"Nucleus\\" section at Toronto Rock and Roll Revival Website In addition, appearances at the festival served to revitalize the careers of certain performers from the 1950s. For example, according to one reviewer, in relation to Little Richard's performance: The Doors, as the headlining act, closed the show. The band's appearance at the 1969 festival would be their last appearance in Toronto, prior to the 1971 death of Jim Morrison.  Audio and video releases  D. A. Pennebaker, who had made the 1967 documentary Dont Look Back, concerning Bob Dylan's 1965 UK tour, and the 1968 documentary Monterey Pop, concerning the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, also filmed the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival. The resulting documentary, Sweet Toronto, was released in 1971. As a result of Pennebaker's involvement, the performances of most of the artists were recorded and filmed. This has led to many authorized and unauthorized audio and video releases. Authorized video releases include the complete concert performances of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard.

He was a retired auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston who served from 2001 to 2014. Early life and career Bishop Edyvean was born in Medford, Massachusetts, on October 18, 1938, and was the only child of Walter and Frances Edyvean. He attended local public schools and graduated from high school in 1956. Edyvean attended Boston College, obtaining a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1960. He studied at St. John's Seminary before furthering his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and Pontifical Gregorian University, there earning a baccalaureate (1963) and licentiate in theology (1965). While in Rome, Edyvean was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Francis Reh on December 16, 1964. He was an assistant pastor at St. Joseph Church in Ipswich, Massachusetts from 1965 to 1968, and earned a doctorate in theology after further studies in Rome from 1968 to 1971. He was a faculty member of St. John's Seminary from 1971. Edyvean initially taught dogmatic theology before moving into the field of sacramental theology as an ordinary professor. In 1990 he returned to Rome and was named capo ufficio of the Congregation for Catholic Education in the Roman Curia.

Literal video versions are usually based on music videos in which the imagery appears illogical, disconnected with the lyrics, and more concerned with impressive visuals than actual meaning. Most of the literal videos have been based on music videos from the 1980s and 1990s. Literal videos generally have new lyrics dubbed over those of the original video, and often include subtitles for better clarity. Lyrics range from references to the video editing (such as Anthony Kiedis being dubbed as saying \\"Now superimpose on me/someone's ugly house\\" in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' video for \\"Under the Bridge\\"), to questioning the unusual things depicted in the video which are usually, by convention, ignored by the participants (for example the lyrics \\"What's happening with that monkey?/What is with this gas mask?/This is a strange library.\\" from the literal version of Tears for Fears' \\"Head Over Heels\\"). The versions of \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" have seen millions of views on YouTube and have created a brief resurgence of the original song in the popular culture. In the concept's first year, YouTube has hosted 100 different \\"literal version\\" videos, from users all over the world, including foreign language entries. Conception The first known example of this meme, a redub of A-ha's \\"Take on Me\\", was posted on YouTube by Dustin McLean in his now-defunct channel Dusto McNeato, in October 2008. McLean, who worked on the animated SuperNews! show on Current TV, stated that the idea for literal videos came about from an inside joke with his fellow workers, and that two of his coworkers along with his wife helped to provide the new vocal lyrics. In the two months after \\"Take On Me\\" was posted, ten other YouTube users began making literal versions of their own. The most popular of these initial non-McLean videos was a redub of Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", by copyrighthater, which went on to receive over two million views in its first year online. The new lyrics give a nod to \\"Rickrolling\\", a previous internet meme that involved tricking people into watching the original video of the same song. Total Eclipse In the first third of 2009, McLean and seven other people made new literal videos. Five of these were by David A. Scott (dascottjr), a commercial producer in upstate New York. His sixth video, a redub of Bonnie Tyler's \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" was posted on May 25, 2009 with the singing done by Scott's friend Felisha Noble.Laderman, David and Westrup, Laurel. Sampling Media, p. 230 (Oxford University Press, 2014). Shortly after, links to it appeared on websites for Entertainment Weekly, the Twitter page of Ashton Kutcher, and Perez Hilton's Twitter page too. From there, the video received 1,009,331 views in its first ten days, surpassing two million views in three weeks. After nearly eleven million views, Sony had YouTube block the video worldwide in 2011. (Shortly before his account was terminated in February 2014, the video was unblocked, and surpassed eleven million.) It is still viewable on Funny Or Die's website, where it has received over 100,000 views, qualifying it for \\"Immortal\\" status since April 2012. Copyright issues In December 2008, literal versions of \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\" were removed from Dustin McLean's YouTube account, due to copyright claims by Warner Music Group. By that time, \\"Take On Me\\" had 2,321,793 views, while \\"Under the Bridge\\" had 340,927. Both videos continued to be available on McLean's \\"Funny or Die\\" page, while copied versions were posted by other users on YouTube. Two of Scott's literal videos, Crowded House's \\"World Where You Live\\" and The Killers' \\"Read My Mind\\" were banned in several non-U.S. countries immediately upon upload, due to copyright restrictions by EMI and Universal Music Group, respectively. In December 2009, the Killers video was blocked worldwide. In August 2009, YouTube user Torrey Meeks, a.k.a. levmyshkin (whose May 2008 \\"Bill O'Reilly Flips Out - DANCE REMIX\\" got 2.9 million views in its first year) saw his literal version of Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal\\" taken down, after a copyright claim by Sony Music, one month after he had posted it. Meeks contested the claim soon after. Later that month (less than a week after excerpts were shown on ABC's \\"Nightline\\"), the literal videos for \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" and James Blunt's \\"You're Beautiful\\" (the latter posted by deshem in December 2008) were both removed from YouTube, after a copyright claim by EMI Music. Via YouTube and Facebook, David A. Scott encouraged friends and fans of the videos to complain about the ban to YouTube and EMI. Before Scott could contact YouTube or EMI himself, both videos were restored to their original accounts on August 26, only two days after they were banned. YouTube and EMI gave no reason for the reversal. That same day, YouTube also unbanned McLean's videos of \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\", without saying why. Also that day, YouTube accepted Meeks' counter-notification, restoring his video of \\"Smooth Criminal\\". However, Sony had Meeks' video removed again by September 1. By the end of December, all but one of Meeks' six literal videos were removed, due to copyright claims by UMG. McLean's \\"Under the Bridge\\" was blocked again in 2010. In November 2009, CeilingofStars posted a literal version of Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\". The video was automatically blocked by YouTube for containing material owned by UMG. The copyright claim was contested, and the video reappeared online, shortly before being removed by Universal. Around the same time, Warner Music Group had cushlinkes' literal version of \\"Whip It\\" removed as well. By the end of December 2009, over twenty of the 100 English language literal videos had been removed from YouTube, mostly due to copyright claims from Universal Music Group and Sony Music. Artists parodied by the removed videos included Billy Joel, Boyz II Men, REM, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Hanson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rick Astley. Some of the removed videos have been re-uploaded on other video websites. Record companies, claiming copyright infringement, would continue to block and remove literal videos from YouTube. According to McLean, various networks (MTV, VH1, and CMT) have contacted him about turning the concept into a TV program. However, the difficulty in getting the rights to original music videos has scared off most developers. In February 2014, YouTube terminated David A. Scott's entire YouTube account, citing \\"multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj-x9ygQEGA He had received two previous, expired copyright strikes in April 2012, for his Killers and Mika videos (both by UMG). The three strikes he received in 2014 were for videos by The Beatles (Apple Corps), Crowded House (UMG), and Nirvana (UMG). In 2014, Scott uploaded all of his literal videos to his Funny or Die channel.http://www.funnyordie.com/dascottjr In 2018, Funny or Die moved all of its site's uploaded videos onto a YouTube server, causing four of Scott's videos to be removed (and redirected to different videos) by YouTube's copyright detection. At the same time, Funny or Die announced they would \\"no longer support open user-generated content\\", meaning that Scott would no longer be able to edit his Funny or Die page or upload new material.https://www.funnyordie.com/2018/8/20/17784670/an-important-note- about-funny-or-die-from-the-folks-at-funny-or-die Mainstream mentions *In the meme's first year, McLean's web, TV, and radio interviews included MSNBC, Rolling Stone, The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal, WTOP Talk Radio, and ABC's Nightline. That same year, Scott's \\"Total Eclipse\\" video was featured on XM Radio's Opie and Anthony, CNN's Anderson Cooper 360°, E!'s The Daily 10, Fox's Good Day L.A., ABC's Nightline, CNN's iReport, and in WIRED magazine. *Literal video versions shown or referred to during TV reports (U.S. and abroad): \\"Take On Me\\", \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"Under the Bridge\\", \\"White Wedding\\", \\"Loser\\", \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", \\"Daydream Believer\\", \\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", \\"Losing My Religion\\", \\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\\", \\"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\\", and \\"We Built This City\\". *TIME magazine's website listed \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart: Literal Video Version\\" as the No. 6 Top Viral Video of 2009.

It was written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden for the short-lived BBC radio series Third Division, and was featured in the second edition on 2 February 1949. It compared the area, during postwar austerity, to faraway exotic locations depicted in travelogues of the day. One memorable part of the sketch is the pronunciation of Balham as \\"Bal-Ham\\" in an American accent, instead of the British pronunciation \\"Ballum\\". The original sketch was performed by Peter Sellers as narrator, with others such as Benny Hill and Michael Bentine contributing other voices. The script features the narration of exaggerated claims regarding the attractions of the area. The sketch was later performed solo by Peter Sellers, in a parody of the American newsreel-travelogue host James A. Fitzpatrick, on the 1958 Parlophone record The Best of Sellers, produced by George Martin. The sketch was scored by Ron Goodwin, and that led Alfred Hitchcock to engage him to do the score for Frenzy. The sketch was expanded in 1979 to form the script of a short (21-minute) color film of the same name directed by Micky Dolenz. Starring Danny Schiller and Judy Gridley as American tourists and Robbie Coltrane in several roles, including those originally voiced by Sellers. It was narrated, in an English accent, by David de Keyser and was released for broadcast in 1981.

Gordon Liddy (ref Watergate and prosecutions against Timothy Leary) and Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.Shaun Assael, Trump echoes Nixon on Mexico gambit, Bostonglobe.com, 28 June 2016 The policy was instituted as a surprise move, although President Nixon had given Mexican President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz some advance warning when they met on September 8, 1969 to dedicate the Lake Amistad Dam International Crossing. The effort involved increased surveillance of the border from both air and sea, but the major part of the policy was the individual inspection, mandated to last three minutes, of every vehicle crossing into the United States from Mexico.Lawrence A. Gooberman, Operation Intercept: The Multiple Consequences of Social Policy. On the same day, Nixon's plan was leaked to the public by the White House correspondent for The New York Times Felix Belair, Jr. The operation was deployed in all 30 border- crossing stations. Radars were installed to detect unobserved border- crossings. The Navy was deployed in the Gulf of Mexico to reinforce the operation. 27 international airports in the US with flights from Mexico were also affected by the operation. On the 8th day, the US authorities declared the ongoing operation was a success, despite many complaints of abusive search techniques by US custom patrols. On the US side of twin cities along the border, retail business dropped more than 50%. The United States-Mexican Border Cities Association organized protests against the operation in those cities. Because of complaints from cross-border travelers, and from Mexican President Diaz Ordaz, the searching of vehicles was reduced after 10 days and completely abandoned after about 20 days.Operation Intercept, Encyclopedia of Drugs, Alcohol, and Addictive Behavior. The Nixon Administration believed that it had largely achieved its goal of encouraging the Mexican government to begin an effort to stem domestic drug production. Then governor Ronald Reagan made a public speech on TV to approve the operation.Reagan on Operation Intercept, Sfsu.edu, 30 September 1969 Aftermath Operation Intercept was disapproved by the State Department and the Bureau of the Budget. Statistics on the volumes of cannabis seized were way below expectations, and did not exceed the average volumes seized before the operation. A lot of US press publicized marijuana during the crisis. Other temporary illegal smuggling channels were activated during the operation, such as high-potent marijuana shipped from Vietnam, of hashish from northern Africa. A marijuana shortage throughout the country led users to experiment with other drugs, or grow their own.Operation intercept, Ann Arbor Sunday, 2 July 1971 G. Gordon Liddy would later state \\"For diplomatic reasons the true purpose of the exercise was never revealed. Operation Intercept, with its massive economic and social disruption, could be sustained far longer by the United States than by Mexico. It was an exercise in international extortion, pure, simple, and effective, designed to bend Mexico to our will.\\" When the operation was ceased, it was replaced by Operation Cooperation, a new anti-drug agreement aiming at designing a shared strategy in fighting drug trafficking. According to Kate Doyle, senior analyst of the National Security Archive, this operation was a success for Nixon on three levels: He gained law-and-order stamina, made Mexico bend to his demands, and started a war on drugs that would last for decades. On the national level, this anti-Mexico campaign had an impact on the stereotype of Mexicans conveyed in the press. Along the border, it revealed how deeply intertwined the Mexican and U.S. border communities were. In the early part of 1970, the Jefferson Airplane released a single entitled \\"Mexico\\". The song was not played on some radio stations at the time because the lyrics referred to Operation Intercept, but this song became a classic on many of the so-called underground radio stations.Bill Thompson Sleeve Notes to Jefferson Airplane’s album ‘Early Flight’ Feb 1974 Grunt APL1-0437 Operation Intercept is sometimes referred to in the Trump wall issue.Trump's Wall: Nixon's 1969 'Operation Intercept', the Hemispheric Drug War and the Border Wall, Ucl.ac.uk, 14 november 2017 ReferencesFurther reading * Elaine Shannon, Desperados: Latin Drug Lords, U.S. Lawmen, and the War America Can't Win, Viking, 1988 () * G.

Laharpe, bust by Félix Lecomte, Gallery of Battles, Palace of Versailles Early career Laharpe was the son of Louis-Philippe de la Harpe; he was born in Château Hutins near Rolle in Vaud Canton, Switzerland in 1754. His cousin was Frédéric-César de la Harpe. Laharpe studied at a school in Haldenstein and served several times as a mercenary in the Netherlands. When he returned home, he commanded a Vaud militia company. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, he renounced his seigneurial privileges. He organized a party to celebrate the Storming of the Bastille in 1791. The authorities in Berne disapproved of his pro-French activities and forced Laharpe to flee to France where he joined the army. Military career Laharpe enjoyed a meteoric rise in the French army, becoming a chief of battalion in 1792. He distinguished himself at the Siege of Toulon, being named general of brigade in 1794. From that year, he served in the Army of Italy. His promotion to general of division came in 1795.Fiebeger, p 8 When Bonaparte took command of the Army of Italy in March 1796, his division commanders included Laharpe, André Masséna, Pierre Augereau, and Jean Sérurier. In the Montenotte Campaign, these four divisions rapidly defeated the Austrian army and forced the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont to sue for peace. Laharpe fought at the Battle of Montenotte and the Second Battle of Dego. Thereafter, his troops guarded the east flank of the army against a possible Austrian counterattack. With the Sardinians subdued, Bonaparte moved against Johann Beaulieu's Austrian army. After marching along the south bank of the Po River, Laharpe's division crossed near Piacenza and thrust north to turn Beaulieu's left flank. Laharpe, with his own division and the army's advance guard, defeated Anton Lipthay's Austrians at the Battle of Fombio during the day on 8 May. After this action, the French pursued as far as Codogno. That evening, another Austrian unit blundered into the French units in the area. Amid a night of confused clashes, Laharpe was accidentally shot to death by his own men as he returned to camp after a reconnoitre.Chandler, p 80 He is honored on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

The film is in the horror comedy genre, which was popular in the 1940s. Plot The elderly Mrs. Bentley (Helen Westley) and her lawyer see a newspaper ad from an unemployed and unmarried engineer seeking work doing “anything legal.” The lawyer calls the engineer, Alexander “Lucky” Downing (Wayne Morris), and sets up a meeting, during which Lucky is offered $1000 to feign an engagement to Mrs. Bentley’s granddaughter Elinor Bentley Fairchild (Alexis Smith) for one month. Lucky considers it a strange offer, but he needs the money so he takes the job. What Downing doesn’t know is that Elinor’s three former fiancés have met horrible fates. The first, Johnny Eggleston, mysteriously drowned. The second, Paul Myron (David Bruce), was paralyzed when his car rolled over and has been confined to an iron lung ever since. The third, Alan Winters, died by snakebite while on the 18th floor of a Boston hotel. Given the fate of her former beaus, there are those who believe Elinor is the victim of the “Smiling Ghost,” and she has been dubbed the “Kiss of Death Girl” by the local newspapers. Lil Barstow (Brenda Marshall), a reporter who has followed the case closely, has been in touch with Myron, who persuades her to talk Downing out of the engagement before he too becomes a victim of the ghost. Lil attempts to intercept Lucky at the train station where he and his nervous valet, Clarence (Willie Best), are to meet Elinor. Before Lil can warn Downing, however, Elinor smashes her camera and hustles Lucky and Clarence off to Bentley mansion. Downing is delighted to find Elinor so attractive and affectionate but has no idea what awaits him at the mansion. There he meets his prospective in-laws: a diabolical great-uncle Ames Bentley (Charles Halton), who shows Lucky his collection of shrunken heads and mentions that he's only missing a good Negroid specimen; cousin Tennant Bentley (Richard Ainley), who has a drinking problem; and Uncle Hilton Fairchild (Roland Drew) and his wife Rose (Lee Patrick), who will lose part of their fortune should Elinor marry. That evening Tennant drunkenly objects to Lucky sleeping in what had been his room, so Lucky agrees to switch rooms with him. Later that night, a man who is presumably the Smiling Ghost emerges through a secret wall panel and attacks Tennant, no doubt believing him to be Downing. In the ensuing confusion, Downing encounters the reporter Lil Barstow outside, who tells him about the fate of the former fiancés and persuades him to leave. Lucky asks her, \\"Couldn't all these have all been accidents?\\" To which Lil replies, \\"Listen, it's more than an accident when a cobra strikes a man on the 18th floor of a Boston hotel.\\" Convinced that the situation is perilous, Downing plans to sneak away with Clarence, who had found the semiconscious Tennant in a trunk in the cellar and is eager to depart; however, after Elinor confesses that she has fallen in love with him, he decides to stay and catch the \\"ghost\\" for her. To find the ghost or whoever it is, Downing turns to Lil for help. She takes him to visit the crippled Paul Myron. Paul relates his ghost story, saying that the ghost appeared when he was pinned under his wrecked car and adding that the ghost resembled John Eggleston, Elinor’s first fiancé. Paul says he believes Eggleston drowned himself after Elinor broke off their engagement and is now intent on making sure she never marries. Downing rejects the idea that Eggleston is a ghost but finds it plausible that he faked his death and is bent on revenge. Lil and Lucky then pay a visit to Eggleston’s crypt in the cemetery and discover it empty. While there, Downing is attacked by the “ghost” and entombed. After he is rescued by Lil, he is even more determined to resolve the mystery. And to that end, he suggests to Elinor that they pretend to marry to lure the killer out of hiding. In the ensuing denouement, the Smiling Ghost is unmasked as Paul Myron and an unexpected espousal is thrown in for good measure.

David W. Keith is Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics for Harvard University's Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Professor of Public Policy for the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University. He is also board member and acting chief scientist at Carbon Engineering. Keith’s research has spanned several domains, including climate-related technology assessment and policy analysis, technology development, atmospheric sciences, and physics. Education *1986, B.S., Physics, University of Toronto *1991, Ph.D., Experimental Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Geo- engineering Keith has worked on solar geoengineering since 1992, when he wrote one of the first assessments of the technology and its policy implications. Since Keith’s 1992 paper, which introduced a structured comparison of cost and risk, and a later review paper that first described the moral hazard and set geoengineering in the post-war history of weather control, Keith has sought answers to the questions: * How unequal? – First quantitative analysis of regional inequality of solar geoengineering. * How to reduce risks? – New method to reduce the amount of sulfur needed for a given radiative forcing; and, a novel class of self-levitated particles that might limit ozone loss. * What does the public think? – First large-scale survey of public perception. * How to regulate? – Proposed two-threshold system that combines deployment moratoria with a pathway for regulating small-scale research. * How to evaluate trade-offs? – Early economic analysis of optimal decisions under uncertainty and a value-of-information analysis while supervising the first economics Ph.D. to focus on geoengineering. In 2013, Keith released a book, A Case for Climate Engineering, detailing a controversial strategy for slowing climate change. The book’s publisher’s blurb states: \\"A leading scientist long concerned about climate change, David Keith offers no naïve proposal for an easy fix to what is perhaps the most challenging question of our time. But he argues that after decades during which very little progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions, we must put climate engineering on the table and consider it responsibly... This book provides a clear and accessible overview of the costs and risks, and how climate engineering might fit into a larger program for managing climate change.\\" He has also contributed to assessments focused on geoengineering. Keith was a member of the working group for UK Royal Society's 2009 report as well as the Bipartisan Policy Center Report. Keith is the co-director, with Gernot Wagner, of Harvard's Solar Geoengineering Research Program founded in 2017. Public comments In 2010, Keith testified before committees of the U.S. Congress and the UK Parliament. He presented to U.S. National Academy meetings in 2000, 2009 and 2013 and was coauthor of the geoengineering sub- chapter (WG 2, 4.7) of the Third IPCC Report and served AR5. Keith has been featured on the Discovery Channel, did an interview on BBC News HARDTalk in November 2011, has participated in TED talks in September 2007, participated in a debate at the Royal Geographical Society in 2009, and appeared in a documentary on geoengineering currently under production. He also discussed his geoengineering idea to slow climate change by spraying reflective particles into the upper atmosphere on The Colbert Report. Other work Keith is sceptical about the benefits of fuel cell vehicles using compressed hydrogen. He is bullish on solar energy.

Boston & Worcester R.R. Corp, 45 Mass. 49 (Mass. 1842),full text Massachusetts Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw used a contract rationale to prevent a railroad worker from recovering from his employer, Boston and Worcester Railroad, for an injury due to the negligence of a switch tender employed by the same company, even though a third party or passenger would likely have been able to recover for the same injury. In Shaw's view, the injured worker was in as good a position as his employer had been (indeed, most likely a better one) to monitor the work of his fellow workers. It followed that to allow Farwell to recover compensatory damages would have been to create a moral hazard in the workplace, softening the blow of employee carelessness for those best able to prevent it. This created the fellow servant rule. In the years and decades that followed, courts in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the United States developed a panoply of doctrines that made it exceedingly difficult for industrial workers to go to law for insurance against the risks of their work. Employees were said to assume the ordinary risks inherent in the workplace. And where an employee's own negligence (no matter how slight) contributed to his injury, he was barred from recovering damages, even from a negligent employer. The contributory fault doctrine connected the law of work risks to a much broader array of nineteenth-century legal rules that limited the law's risk-spreading capacity. People entering onto someone else's land were owed only a limited duty of care, and sometimes no duty of care at all. The Farwell opinion has been seen by some scholars as providing the financial stability necessary to secure the success of an infant railroad industry.See, e.g., Leonard W. Levy, Lemuel Shaw: America's \\"Greatest Magistrate\\", 7 VILL. L. REV. 389, 399-400 n123 (1962). Held *The mere incompetency of a fellow servant is insufficient to render the master liable for his negligent acts, absent a showing that the master knew of such incompetency, and was negligent in continuing to employ him. *A master is not liable for injuries to a servant, caused by the negligence of a fellow servant engaged in the same general business, where the master has furnished proper appliances, and has not been negligent in the selection of fellow employees. *Employees engaged in the same general business are fellow servants, though they are in different departments of work. *The liability of a master for injuries to a servant, caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, is not dependent on the ability of the injured servant to influence the acts and conduct of the negligent servant. *An engineer in the employ of a railroad company cannot recover for injuries caused by the negligence of a switch tender, who is employed by the same company, since they are fellow servants. *A person entering the service of another assumes all risks naturally incident to that employment, including the danger of injury by the fault or negligence of a fellow servant. *A railroad company employed A., who was careful and trusty in his general character, to tend the switches on their road; and, after he had been long in their service, they employed B. to run the passenger train of cars on the road, B. knowing the employment and character of A.

It is elicited by any unpredictable stimulus in the absence of task demands. It is often referred to with the following P200 evoked potential as the \\"N100-P200\\" or \\"N1-P2\\" complex. While most research focuses on auditory stimuli, the N100 also occurs for visual (see visual N1, including an illustration), olfactory, heat, pain, balance, respiration blocking, and somatosensory stimuli. The auditory N100 is generated by a network of neural populations in the primary and association auditory cortices in the superior temporal gyrus in Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale. It also could be generated in the frontal and motor areas. The area generating it is larger in the right hemisphere than the left. The N100 is preattentive and involved in perception because its amplitude is strongly dependent upon such things as the rise time of the onset of a sound, its loudness, interstimulus interval with other sounds, and the comparative frequency of a sound as its amplitude increases in proportion to how much a sound differs in frequency from a preceding one. Neuromagnetic research has linked it further to perception by finding that the auditory cortex has a tonotopic organization to N100. However, it also shows a link to a person's arousal and selective attention. N100 is decreased when a person controls the creation of auditory stimuli, such as their own voice. Types There are three subtypes of adult auditory N100. * N100b or vertex N100, peaking at 100 ms. * T-complex N100a, largest at temporal electrodes at 75 ms * T-complex N100c, follows N100a and peaks at about 130 ms. The two T-complex N100 evoked potentials are created by auditory association cortices in the superior temporal gyri. Elicitation The N100 is often known as the \\"auditory N100\\" because it is elicited by perception of auditory stimuli. Specifically, it has been found to be sensitive to things such as the predictability of an auditory stimulus, and special features of speech sounds such as voice onset time. =During sleep= It occurs during both REM and NREM stages of sleep though its time is slightly delayed. During stage 2 NREM it seems responsible for the production of K-complexes. N100 is reduced following total sleep deprivation and this associates with an impaired ability to consolidate memories. =Stimulus repetition= The N100 depends upon unpredictability of stimulus: it is weaker when stimuli are repetitive, and stronger when they are random. When subjects are allowed to control stimuli, using a switch, the N100 may decrease. This effect has been linked to intelligence, as the N100 attenuation for self-controlled stimuli occurs the most strongly (i.e., the N100 shrinks the most) in individuals who are also evaluated as having high intelligence. Indeed, researchers have found that in those with Down syndrome \\"the amplitude of the self-evoked response actually exceeded that of the machine-evoked potential\\". Being warned about an upcoming stimulus also reduces its N100. The amplitude of N100 shows refractoriness upon repetition of a stimulus; in other words, it decreases at first upon repeated presentations of the stimulus, but after a short period of silence it returns to its previous level. Paradoxically, at short repetition the second N100 is enhanced both for sound and somatosensory stimuli. With paired clicks, the second N100 is reduced due to sensory gating. =Voice onset time= The difference between many consonants is their voice onset time (VOT), the interval between consonant release (onset) and the start of rhythmic vocal cord vibrations in the vowel. The voiced stop consonants /b/, /d/ and /g/ have a short VOT, and unvoiced stop consonants /p/, /t/ and /k/ long VOTs. The N100 plays a role in recognizing the difference and categorizing these sounds: speech stimuli with a short 0 to +30 ms voice onset time evoke a single N100 response but those with a longer (+30 ms and longer) evoked two N100 peaks and these are linked to the consonant release and vocal cord vibration onset. Top-down influences Traditionally, 50 to 150 ms evoked potentials were considered too short to be influenced by top-down influences from the prefrontal cortex. However, it is now known that sensory input is processed by the occipital cortex by 56 ms and this is communicated to the dorsolateral frontal cortex where it arrives by 80 ms. Research also finds that the modulation effects upon N100 are affected by prefrontal cortex lesions. These higher-level areas create the attentive, repetition, and arousal modulations upon the sensory area processing reflected in N100. PDF Another top-down influence upon N100 has been suggested to be efference copies from a person's intended movements so that the stimulation that results from them are not processed. A person's own voice produces a reduced N100 as does the effect of a self-initiated compared to externally created perturbation upon balance. Development in children The N100 is a slow-developing evoked potential. From one to four years of age, a positive evoked potential, P100, is the predominant peak. Older children start to develop a negative evoked potential at 200 ms that dominates evoked potentials until adolescence; this potential is identical to the adult N100 in scalp topography and elicitation, but with a much later onset. The magnetic M100 (measured by MEG rather than EEG) is, likewise, less robust in children than in adults. An adult-like N100-P200 complex only develops after 10 years of age. The various types of N100 mature at different times. Their maturation also varies with the side of the brain: N100a in the left hemisphere is mature before three years of age but this does not happen in the right hemisphere until seven or eight years of age. Clinical use The N100 may be used to test for abnormalities in the auditory system where verbal or behavioral responses cannot be used, such with individuals in coma; in such cases, it can help predict the probability of recovery. Another application is in assessing the optimal level of sedation in intensive critical care. High density mapping of the location of the generators of M100 is being researched as a means of presurgical neuromapping needed for neurosurgery. Many cognitive or other mental impairments are associated with changes in the N100 response, including the following: *There is some evidence that the N100 is affected in those with dyslexia and specific language impairment.Shaul S. (2007). Evoked response potentials (ERPs) in the study of dyslexia: A review. pp. 51–91. In (Breznitz Z. Editor) Brain Research in Language. Springer *The sensory gating effect upon N100 with paired clicks is reduced in those with schizophrenia. *In individuals with tinnitus, those with smaller N100 are less distressed than those with larger amplitudes. *Migraine is associated with an increase rather than decrease in N100 amplitude with repetition of the high-intensity stimulation. *Headache sufferers also have more reactive N100 to somatosensory input than nonsufferers The N100 is 10 to 20% larger than normal when the auditory stimulus is synchronized with the diastolic phase of the cardiac blood pressure pulse. Relationship to mismatch negativity The Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an evoked potential that occurs at roughly the same time as N100 in response to rare auditory events. It differs from the N100 in that: * They are generated in different locations. * The MMN occurs too late to be an N100. * The MMN, unlike N100, may be elicited by stimulus omissions (i.e., not hearing a stimulus when you expect to hear one). Though this suggests that they are separate processes, arguments have been made that this is not necessarily so and that they are created by the \\"relative activation of multiple cortical areas contributing to both of these 'components'\\". History Pauline A. Davis at Harvard University first recorded the wave peak now identified with N100.Davis PA. (1939). Effects of acoustic stimuli on the waking human brain. J Neurophysiol 2: 494–499 abstract The present use of the N1 to describe this peak originates in 1966 and N100 later in the mid 1970s. The origin of the wave for a long time was unknown and only linked to the auditory cortex in 1970. Due to magnetoencephalography, research is increasingly done upon M100, the magnetic counterpart of the electroencephalographic N100. Unlike electrical fields which face the high resistance of the skull and generate secondary or volume currents, magnetic fields which are orthogonal to them have a homogeneous permeability through the skull. This enables the location of sources generating fields that are tangent to the head surface with an accuracy of a few millimeters.Hämäläinen M, Hari R, Ilmoniemi RJ, Knuutila J. (1993). Magnetoencephalography-theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain. Reviews of modern Physics. 65: 413–497. New techniques, such as event- related beam-forming with magnetoencephalography, allow sufficiently accurate location of M100 sources to be clinically useful for preparing surgery upon the brain.

Political and diplomatic career Nsahlai, a member of the Nso ethnic group, was born in North West Province. After serving as Chargé de mission under Prime Minister Paul Biya from 1975 to 1982, he was First Councillor at the Cameroonian Embassy in West Germany from 1982 to 1984. He was appointed by Biya (who was by this point President) as Assistant Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Republic, with the rank of Minister, in 1984; he was then moved to another diplomatic post in 1985, when he was appointed as Ambassador to the Central African Republic. Nsahlai wrote a book, Look Up To The Mountain: Beyond Party Politics, while he was Ambassador to the Central African Republic. Although the book stirred controversy among the political establishment for its independent outlook, President Biya took no action against him; some argued that this indicated that dissenting and minority viewpoints were tolerated in the CPDM.Peterkins Manyong, \\"The Nsahlai Phenomenon In Cameroon Politics\\", The Post (Cameroon), 3 September 2007. Nsahlai remained Ambassador to the Central African Republic until Biya appointed him to the government as Minister of Transport on 27 April 2001. He remained in the latter post until August 2002, when John Begheni Ndeh was appointed to replace him. Nsahlai helped to create the Bui Common Development Platform, which his supporters credited with improving the CPDM's performance in Bui during the 2002 parliamentary election. He was appointed as the head of a CPDM reforms commission in November 2003.Asong Ndifor and Michael Ndi, \\"Biya bows to progressives, appoints Nsahlai to head CPDM reform commission\\" , The Herald, 19 November 2003. Later, on 24 January 2006, Nsahlai was appointed as Board Chairman of the Douala Port Authority]. Nsahlai worked to persuade the CPDM Central Committee to create a separate Section of the CPDM for Jakiri and campaigned for the party in Jakiri during the July 2007 parliamentary election. After the CPDM won the 2007 election in Jakiri, Social Democratic Front (SDF) Chairman John Fru Ndi alleged on Cameroon Radio and Television's Cameroon Calling that Nsahlai had intimidated voters with gunfire. Nsahlai denied this allegation and said that he did not even know how to use a gun. Nsahlai, who held various traditional Nso titles, participated in a festival marking Ngonnso, a Nso cultural event, in April 2008, and he hosted a traditional Nso warriors' dance on 12 April.

Orick (formerly, Arekw, Orekw, and Oreq, Yurok: 'O'rekw ) is a census-designated place situated on the banks of the Redwood Creek in Humboldt County, California. It is located north of Eureka, at an elevation of 26 feet (8 m). The population was 357 at the 2010 census. Rare minerals orickite and coyoteite were discovered at Coyote Peak near Orick. History O'rekw means \\"mouth of the river\\" in Yurok. Orick evolved from the original word. The Yurok people had 74 known villages in the area, O'rekw was one of five where jumping dances were held. At times spelled Or'eQw, it is important to note that there is no \\"Q\\" in the living Yurok Peoples language alphabet. Non-native settlers arrived with the gold rush, beginning in 1850 after the Josiah Gregg expedition discovered Humboldt Bay. Orick was settled not only for being on the way to mining claims in the Trinity, but for five beach sand mining claims fronting several miles of beach in the Gold Bluff District. The gold sands did not produce well, and the local gold rush was over by the 1870s. The first post office at Orick opened in 1887. The earliest wagons traveled along the beaches, but in 1894 the county - that time covering both the modern Humboldt and Del Norte counties - finished a wagon road between Eureka and Crescent City. Lumbering removed the trees in and around Orick and dairy farmers utilized the flood plain. Until a bridge was built in 1903, Redwood Creek was always crossed by Swan's Ferry. The original Orick Inn Robert Swan was a local rancher and businessman who owned the ferry and the local store, which was bought out by native Eurekan Elmer L. Devlin (August 1, 1877 - ?) who built the original Orick Inn. Devlin's first building burned down in 1918 and was rebuilt by 1922. It was known for home cooked food, as well as hosting fishermen and notables including opera singer Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink, actors Fred MacMurray and Ronald Colman and President Herbert Hoover. In 1924, the Redwood Highway reached Orick and by the 1930s connected all the way from San Francisco to Oregon. Tourists arrived to see the giant redwoods. After World War II, Orick became a lumber and timber mill town in response to the post-war demand for timber. The business boomed for about fifteen years until closed by the consolidation of mills in larger towns and foundation of the Redwood National Park. =Elephant Historical Plaque= On October 1, 1927, a circus elephant named \\"Big Diamond\\" collapsed five miles north of Orick after freeing ten \\"Honest Bill Animal Show\\" trucks mired in the new highway construction. Honest Bill told a highway contractor that the elephant's skin was valuable and that the contractor could keep the money if he would remove the remains. The contractor skinned and buried the elephant, but the skin turned out to be useless. Many years later, the elephants bones were unearthed, and originally misidentified as a mammoth, but newspaper morgues found and repeated the story of Big Diamond's demise. A memorial plaque was placed near where the bones were found in May 1993 by E Clampus Vitus Eureka Chapter 101.Photo 2016. Geography Orick is part of the California Coast Range, lying close to the Pacific Ocean along U.S. 101. It is bisected by Redwood Creek. It is about south of the current northern border of Humboldt County and an equal distance north of the town of Trinidad. The Orick/Gold Bluff Beach district runs about along the beach at Orick. Placer mining started in 1852 and continued until the 1880s during which time the district yielded more than $10 million value. Gold here is found in black sands at the beach and east of the beaches; its source may be sorted from materials brought down the Klamath River which arrives in the Pacific twenty miles north of Orick. = Redwood Creek Flood Control Project- Humboldt County= Floods in 1950, 1953, 1955 and 1964 resulted in channel enlargement, excavation and the construction of earthen levees along each side of the lower Redwood Creek (Humboldt County) by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during 1966 to 1968 to protect the community of Orick. An error was made within the construction. Fault was admitted shortly after the completion. Observation shows this design flaw invades the Redwood Creek estuary. This unwarranted annexation causes extreme damage to the ecosystem. The estuary sits at the western end of the flawed levee system known as the Redwood Creek Flood Control Project- Humboldt County (RCFCP- Humboldt County).The system is maintained by Humboldt County which determined that a general investigation is needed by USACE to consider reworking the system to a more natural condition while retaining flood control benefits.

The Barasa were initially successful but the final victory went to the Ubaidat. Historical background The Ubaidat had already been engaged (probably in the eighteenth century) in a large-scale war with their eastern neighbours, the tribe of Aulad-Ali, which is also descended from the Banu-Su'da tribe of the Banu Sulaym tribe from Arabia). The war ended with the defeat of Aulad-Ali and their expulsion from the whole of Cyrenaica to Egypt. This war has been known in the Libyan folklore as \\"Tajridat Habeeb\\".De Agostini, p.57 & S. M. Jibril, pp.91–21. Although Jibril assumed that the Tajrida occurred in 1670, it's more conceivable to assume that it happened in the 18th century (during the rule of the Karamanli dynasty as Jibril himself wrote). Abubakr Haddouth's citadel at Qayqab. In 1844, Abubakr Haddouth, the leader of Barasa, the descendants of Idrisids of Morocco,De Agostini, p.287 was appointed by the Ottoman Empire as a Bey over all the Harabi tribesM. M. Bazama, p.68 (Barasa, Ubaidat, Hassa, Drissa, Fayed family, and Aulad-Hamad). The Ubaidat considered Abubakr to be cruel, and thus resented being under his influence.De Agostini, p.297, Conflict was inevitable. Course of War The war began in 1860. Despite Turkish support of Ubaidat, the Barasa, successful at first, advanced through Ubaidat's territory to \\"Ain Mara\\" where they met a heavy and decisive defeat. The war ended in 1890, with the loss of 2,000 lives from both sides,De Agostini, p.203, & F. Rovere, p.111 including two of Abubakr's brothers. Little information is available about this long war. Abubakr did not survive to see the end of the war, he moved to Benghazi and died there in 1870.De Agostini, p.294, & F. Rovere, p.146 Legacy This was not the only war between tribes in Cyrenaica. Wars like the Barasa-Ubaidat war were conventional there. The Barasa-Ubaidat war was the nineteenth century version of the Basus War. With the coming of Mohammed ben Ali es Senussi, founder of the Senussi order in the nineteenth century, to Cyrenaica the number of wars had gradually diminished. When the Italians invaded Libya in 1911, Senussi leaders had no difficulty in unifying the tribes' efforts against the invaders. Again, like the Basus War, poetry and exaggerated tales are the main remnants of this war.

Companies pay a fee to Amazon and provide products for review. The products are then passed to Amazon reviewers who are then required to publish a review. Past and present participating companies include Logitech, Harper Collins, Philips, Samsung, Bose, Sony, Tefal, Microsoft, Breville, Bosch, Garmin, Dyson, Remington, Case Logic, Creative, Braun, Sennheiser, Olympus, LG, Black & Decker, Acer and Walker Books. Reception for the program has been mixed with some people criticizing the program's use of non-professional reviewers while others cited this as a benefit. The Vine program operates independently on Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr, Amazon.de, and Amazon.ca. Membership Vine members (known as \\"Vine Voices\\") are selected from the Amazon reviewer base with the site stating that the selection criteria are \\"based on the trust [the members] earned in the Amazon community for writing accurate and insightful reviews\\". As of October 2017, Amazon has ended all customer online discussion boards, including the ones that previously existed for Amazon Vine program members.https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId;=201929720 Previously there were two Vine newsletters every month. The first newsletter appeared on the third Thursday of the month and the second appeared on the fourth Thursday. Leftover items from these newsletters went to the \\"Last Harvest\\" list, from where Vine members could choose an unlimited amount of products. Products available for review can include books, furniture, home decor, baby items, office supplies, art and craft supplies, movies, video games, toys, clothing, electronics, hunting gear, fitness equipment, small appliances, sports equipment, groceries, vitamins, homeopathic medicine, over the counter medicine, personal care products (shampoo, soap, hair products), makeup, jewelry, purses, luggage, and other sundries. In return for products received, members are required to post a review within 30 days of delivery. Members are able to sell or give away products received after six months. The Vine process last changed October 2016. Vine members voluntarily can check the website for a changing array of items and can select an unlimited amount from both their targeted Vine offers or from Vine for All. This change was a response to increased vendor interest in this program. Beginning 1 July 2015, Vine members in the USA are required to provide tax identification numbers to Amazon before receiving any new materials to review. Amazon uses the estimated tax value (ETV) of products as non-cash, taxable payments to Vine Voices for their services. Ownership of each Vine third-party product transfers to the respective Vine Voice six months after the order date, and it is then that the ETV applies for tax purposes; Amazon issues a 1099 to Vine members. Exceptions to this usually pertain to consumable items such as food, vitamins and makeup, which are valued at $0. Criticism The program has been met with criticism over the program's lack of transparency and the professionalism of its reviewers. Kristen McLean, formerly of the Association of Booksellers for Children, commented that Amazon did not initially disclose that publishers paid to have their products listed and that \\"Amazon is not specific about how many people are in the program, how they're chosen.\\" The program also initially met criticism over the visibility of the reviews, with librarian Elizabeth Bird (author and Top 500 Amazon Reviewer) commenting that her reviews were sometimes \\"shuffled off to the side\\" while Vine reviews were more prominently and visibly placed. Bird further commented that some of the reviewers were choosing and criticizing books that they were \\"not the best representative readers for\\" and that this highlighted the difference between lay readers and professional reviewers, that latter of who would be more able to \\"give insightful commentary and acknowledge a book's intended audience\\".

The album was Black's second to be produced by David Mackay. Mackay revealed on an interview on Cilla Black's official website that he considered this album as his best work with the songstress and by far the project with the most memories attached. This was mainly down to the fact that some of the album's recording sessions were held in the United States away from the distractions of Black's usual television work commitments. The creative process involved Mackay flying out beforehand to Los Angeles where he scouted for suitable song material and session musicians. Mackay achieved his goals and hired acclaimed musicians, such as guitarist Lee Ritenour (Carly Simon, Barbra Streisand), bassist Herbie Flowers (Elton John, David Bowie, Harry Nilsson) and Alan Tarney (The Shadows). Black with her husband Bobby Willis then joined Mackay to finalise the song selection and lay her vocals. This was her first recording sessions to be held outside the United Kingdom. Although completed in 1975, the release of the album was purposely delayed until Black returned to BBC television with her 1976 variety show series Cilla. The album however eluded chart success but did receive critical acclaim in the national press. Black's official website also conducted an opinion poll in the 1990s which revealed the album to be one of her fans all-time favourites.

The Berndt Museum is currently located with the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery on the western side of the University of Western Australia's Crawley campus. Housing 12,000 objects and 35,000 photographs, the museum contains one of the finest collections of Indigenous Australian art and cultural artifacts in the world, according to the Collections Australia Network (CAN).Collections Australia Network archived at Pandora. Retrieved 6 January 2015 The collection consists of contemporary and historical Aboriginal Australian material culture from regions such as Arnhem Land, the Kimberley, Pilbara, the South West and the Western Desert. The museum also houses substantial Asian and Papua New Guinean collections.  History  The Berndt Museum at the University of Western Australia holds one of Australia’s finest and most important collections of Aboriginal cultural material and knowledge, manifesting in art, objects, archives, film, sound and photographs. The significance of the collection is renowned nationally and internationally, but its strength lies most in the inherent value to Aboriginal people and communities of origin and creation. The diversity of regions represented in the Berndt Museum holdings extends beyond Australia to Melanesia and southeast Asia; reaching as far as China, India, Japan and Egypt, firmly locating UWA and the state of Western Australia within the Asia-Pacific region. The Museum was founded by Professor Ronald and Dr Catherine Berndt who came to Perth in 1956 to develop teaching and research in anthropology at UWA, bringing with them a large collection of material acquired during their field work in various areas of Australia and Papua New Guinea. This original collection was formally gifted to the University which, in 1976, established the Anthropology Research Museum to house it and several other collections transferred from UWA’s Anthropology department. The Museum’s official launch and exhibits opened on 22 February 1979, showcasing collections from northeast and western Arnhem Land, the Kimberley, southwest South Australia, central Western Australia and the Western Desert. In 1992, two years after Ronald Berndt’s death, the Anthropology Research Museum was renamed the Berndt Museum of Anthropology in honour of Ronald and Catherine’s contribution to the University, the field of anthropology and the Museum. Catherine’s death in 1994 resulted in another generous bequest to UWA and the Museum. It contained the remainder of their private collections, including a significant Asian collection, the Ronald and Catherine Berndt Field Notebooks (under embargo until 2024) and the RM and CH Berndt Personal Archive of manuscripts, personal and professional papers.  Collections  The Berndt Museum holds a range of collections of national significance. This includes more than 11,500 items, 35,000 photographs, film and sound and multiple archives, and is considered to be one of the most significant collections of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and cultural material globally. The collections include Asian and Melanesian material, as well as representations from across the world that broaden its international appeal. = History = The Museum's history spans some 60 years of collecting with well over 100 years of historical and contemporary material that has continued to be supported, and with continued additions being made to existing donations by researchers locally, nationally and internationally. The Museum collections provide a means of encouraging the exchange of knowledge and igniting much- needed dialogue regarding culture, place, politics, law, identity and heritage. = Yirrkala Drawing Collection - UNESCO Memory of the World Register = The Yirrkala Drawings were first collected and documented by renowned anthropologists, Catherine and Ronald Berndt. Catherine and Ronald worked with the Yolngu Community in 1946 and 1947 and, when it was believed that bark paintings with original designs would not survive local conditions and travel from a remote wetland setting to an urban one, rolls of brown paper and packets of crayons were called on to execute the designs in another medium. Yolngu from several clan groups were involved in creating the coloured crayon on brown paper drawings, many of which were inspired by land-based and interrelated designs evident on traditional bark paintings. The drawings produced by significant artists such as Mawalan and Wandjuk Marika, Munggurrawuy Yunupingu, Narritjin Maymuru and Wonggu Mununggurr are among the 365 works currently held in the Berndt Museum’s Collection. In 2009, the Yirrkala Drawings Collection was successfully nominated for inclusion on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Australian Register. = Photographic = The Berndt Photographic Material Collection (BPMC) consists of negatives in various formats and digital images that are diverse in provenance and subject matter. Although a significant number of researchers and academics make use of the photographic material, this collection is of particular importance to Aboriginal community members as a visual point of reference in making connections to family, place and culture.  Returning Photos Project  The Berndt Museum of Anthropology will act as point of contact for public requests for access to the photographic material compiled by the 'Returning Photos: Australian Aboriginal Photographs in European Collections' project. The project, funded by the Australian Research Council under its Discovery scheme (DP110100278), collated and presents information about historical photographs of Australian Aboriginal people held in four European Museums: the University of Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum, the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, the Musee du Quai Branly in Paris, and the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen (National Museum of World Cultures) in Leiden. = Archives = The Berndt Museum Archive contains a number of discrete collections documenting Australian Aboriginal knowledge, law and culture, socio-economic and political life, histories and interactions. The Ronald M and Catherine H Berndt Field Notebooks and Personal Archive are currently subject to a 30-year embargo that will lift in 2024.  Exhibitions  The Berndt Museum of Anthropology holds two major exhibitions annually, as well as associated public events. The changing program of exhibitions take place throughout the academic year and are held in the Janet Holmes à Court Gallery within the gallery. = Major Exhibition Listing = * Out of the boxes and into the Desert. 13 July – 7 December 2019 - Out of the boxes and into the Desert explores the Berndt Museum of Anthropology’s collection of paintings from the Central Desert.

It is the third book in The Stone Dance of the Chameleon trilogy, which concerns the harrowing experiences of the young and inexperienced heir to a ruling dynasty who is suddenly taken from his protected childhood and thrust into a cruel society where he must fight for his family honour, his position and his life. The Third God continues the story of Chameleon and the would-be God Emperor Osidian, who has raised a barbarian army and now seeks revenge on those who stripped him of his rightful inheritance and left him for dead. Pinto said that though the novel had been published in the United Kingdom and Portugal, he had been \\"bitterly disappointed\\" when both his US and German publishers had decided not to publish it. He noted, \\"When it came out, it was barely reviewed, and it felt to me as if, after spending years creating a ship, it had slid down the slipway, and sank with barely a trace. I had hoped for more.\\" Description This is the final book in a series of three. Some series become formulaic with the same characters going over the same ground on the way to a final victory, but not this one. It is definitely one story in three parts. The first in the series is perhaps the most nearly a traditional fantasy epic, with the unsuspecting hero growing into his role as a master of the Guarded Land and taking part in the election of the new god- emperor...before everything comes apart. The second recounts time in exile in the Earthsky where our heroes forge an army out of the barbarian tribes. This book recounts their return to the Guarded Land and final battle to recover their birthright. The book could just about be read as a complete story, but much relies upon a knowledge of the previous books to be fully appreciated. Yet this is not a conventional fantasy. It is set in a wholly barbaric land, where the ruling Masters are truly masters of their art of inflicting suffering. The whole story is told from the perspective of Carnelian, who in the first book has to come to terms with violence, maiming and death being visited on his family and those he has grown up with, having been raised by his father in exile and thus been sheltered from the casual violence of the society he has inherited to rule. In the second, he experiences the lot of a slave, being cast out together with Osidian (who was brought up at court so is thoroughly versed in the best of Masterly sadistic intrigue) before building a following amongst the plains people, leaving a steadily growing wake of death as they go. In the third the massed armies of the guarded land, together with all the weapons of destruction the Masters could devise are brought together with predictable results of death on an even greater scale than before. All this death and violence will be off-putting for some readers, yet it is used through Carnelian's reaction against it as a cry against the horrors of war. The rising tide of destruction is an object lesson in unforeseen consequences and the risks of carelessly destroying all you hold dear through the singleminded pursuit of some goal. Carnelian is not an uncertain hero but has to make hard choices as he tries to support yet also restrain Osidian's determination to return to power at the heart of the empire. The plot is a good fantasy epic with plenty of twists and turns, and despite all the devastation manages to maintain a thread of hope for the final resolution to the conflict. Yet it also keeps you guessing, for with so many losses along the way it is never certain which apparently central character will be next to depart for another life. There is a love story woven through it, which once again is an assertion of the triumph of fundamental humanity against impossible obstacles.

Its suspension was based on that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided that it would be easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. In Slovak service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising.  Description  The LT vz. 34 was assembled from a framework of steel \\"angle iron\\" beams, to which armor plates were riveted. A firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. A door allowed access to the engine from the crew compartment. It also had ventilation openings that could be closed. The driver sat on the right side using a observation port protected by two flaps. The inner flap had an episcope with a 25° field of view. It was connected to the armored outer flap so that opening one closed the other. The outer flap had a 3 mm slit. To his right was a vision slit protected by of bulletproof glass. The inner flap was padded so that the driver could rest his head on it when driving. The radio operator sat on the left and had his own vision port with 50 mm of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount with 30° of traverse. It could elevate 25° and depress 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. The mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if the plug at the top of the ball mount was removed. If necessary the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable.Kliment and Francev, p. 52 The turret ring had a diameter of . The turret sides were thick and its roof had a thickness of . The turret was manually traversed (3° per rotation of the handle), but the gearing could be disengaged to allow the commander to shoulder the turret around as desired. The turret had a flat face in the center of which was mounted the main armament. On the right side was another machine gun in a ball mount. The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror, 1.3 × 35° periscope which he could extend once he removed its armored cover in his hatch for vision while \\"buttoned-up\\". This meant that the commander was responsible for loading, aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank.Kliment and Francev, pp. 52–53 The vertical front and side armor was 15 mm thick, the slanted plates had a thickness of , the engine hatch was thick and the top and bottom plates were 8 mm in thickness. This was deemed enough to deflect armor-piercing 7.92 mm bullets fired from distances greater than .Kliment and Francev, p. 51 The , water-cooled, , inline 4-cylinder Praga engine used a gasoline-alcohol mix. It had a top speed on the road of and about cross-country. One fuel tank was located on each side of the engine. The transmission had four forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the front- mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was an enlarged and modified version of that used in the Carden-Loyd tankettes. It consisted of two small road wheels fastened together on a frame, two frames paired and sprung by leaf springs that made a wheel carrier, two wheel carriers per side. The track was guided by two return rollers and wooden, metal-lined frames. The rear-mounted idler wheel was used to adjust track tension. It had a ground pressure of only . It could cross a ditch wide, climb an obstacle high and ford a stream 80 cm deep. It could uproot trees thick and breach a wall thick. The main armament was a Škoda ÚV vz. 34 (A3) gun with a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armored recoil cylinder above the barrel. It fired a armor-piercing shell at . It was credited with penetrating a plate inclined at 30° from the vertical 37 mm thick at , thick at , thick at , and thick at .Chamberlain and Doyle, p. 245 Another source quotes penetration of a vertical plate thick at . The machine gun's ball mount could be coupled to the main gun or used independently. Both weapons could elevate 25° and depress 10°. They both used 1.25× power sights with a 25° field of view. The tank used Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 35 heavy machine guns in both ball mounts.Kliment and Francev, p. 53  Development  One prototype was ordered from Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk in 1931, but development was slow and it was accepted only in November 1932. Its evaluations were very positive and an order for fifty was placed on 19 April 1933. The first six of these were to serve as pre-production models and were to be delivered by 30 September 1933. The delivery date for the next batch of twenty-four was a year after that and the final batch of twenty was due by 30 July 1935. Production was delayed by quality problems with the initial batch of armor plates from Poldi and delivery of the pre-production series did not occur until 23 April 1934. A bigger problem was that the Army had rejected ČKD's proposed armament of a Vickers 44/60 gun and two ZB vz. 26 machine guns so the contract was signed with no design work on the desired armament configuration. ČKD did not finalize its design until December 1933 and the first six tanks were delivered with only a pair of ZB vz. 26 machine guns. The last tanks were delivered on 14 January 1936, but the six pre-production models had to be returned to the factory to be upgraded with the proper armament and otherwise modified up to the latest standards. The last one was delivered on 17 August 1936.Kliment and Francev, pp. 48–51 Operational historyCzechoslovakia= A Czechoslovak LT vz. 34 in 1935 The Czechoslovak Army realized that the 15 mm armor on its LT vz. 34 tanks was too thin and a program to replace it was quickly mounted which resulted in the LT vz. 35. In the meantime they offered the Army an opportunity to train with more modern tanks than its few surviving World War I-era Renault FTs. Each of the three armored regiments received between 9 and 24 tanks until replaced by the LT vz. 35 from 1937. After the Munich Agreement in October 1938 the army tried to sell them, but could find no takers. In November 1938 it decided to concentrate all of them in the Third Armored Regiment in Slovakia, but only eighteen had been transferred before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the Slovak declaration of independence in March 1939. =Germany= The Germans captured 22 LT vz. 34s - plus the prototype, when they occupied Czechoslovakia, but there is no record of their use so they were presumably quickly scrapped. Ten LT vz. 34s were captured after they were abandoned by the insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944. They were shipped to Škoda Works for repairs, but the local military representative ordered them scrapped because of their poor condition and obsolescence. The Waffen-SS tried to overturn this order as it planned to transfer them to Nazi puppet state of Croatia. Two were saved from the scrapyard, but by March 1945 the others had their turrets salvaged to be rearmed with two machine guns and mounted in fixed fortifications. =Hungary= Hungary captured one LT vz. 34 in Carpatho-Ukraine on 15 March 1939, when it conquered that country. Impressed, the Hungarians asked Škoda for a quote to repair it. The Hungarians did not accept the price, but Škoda fixed it for free once the Hungarians had bought a license to build the medium 40M Turán I tank in August 1940. It was returned to Hungary in March 1941 and were used for training through 1943.Kliment and Francev, pp. 97–98 =Slovakia= The 27 LT vz. 34s (including 9 LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov) formed one company in the Armored Battalion \\"Martin\\" formed by the Slovak Army in mid-1939, which was later expanded into the Armored Regiment, but they were relegated to training duties once the Slovaks began to receive more modern tanks from Germany in 1941.Kliment and Nakládal, pp. 36–37, 46 Ten were abandoned by the insurgents when the Slovak National Uprising began in September 1944 and were quickly captured by the Germans. The others were dug in on the approaches to Zvolen.

The club's 1942–43 campaign ended in relegation after a 12th-place result. As the war progressed and turned against Germany teams were often merged into wartime sides known as Kriegspielgemeinschaft in order to deal with player shortages. After 17 October 1943 SC played alongside Fußballverein Saarbrücken as part of KSG Saarbrücken until war's end. After the conflict SC won promotion for the 1950–51 season to the regional first division Saarlandliga which had emerged as a separate football competition as a result of attempts by the French to annex the state of Saarland. The club earned a 12th-place finish and the following year became part of the Amateurliga Saarland when the region's football clubs rejoined German competition. A 4th-place result in the 1951–52 campaign won SC a place in the 2. Liga Südwest (II) where they played for two seasons before being relegated. Between 1954 and 1961 the Altenkessel side was part of the Amateurliga Saarland (III) where they generally earned mid-table results. In 1961 they slipped to the 2.

After a series of upper table finishes they captured the division title in 1982 and advanced to the Verbandsliga Saarland (IV). They were demoted in 1987 after several lower table finishes. They narrowly escaped relegation from the Landesliga Saarland, Gruppe Südwest (V) in 1991, but were sent down the following year after finishing last. After a single season turn in the Bezirksliga Saarland, Gruppe Süd SC slipped out of sight into lower level local competition.

Hale (born Stephen Fowler Hale; January 31, 1816 – July 18, 1862) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from Alabama to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. In July 1862, he died of wounds received at the Battle of Gaines' Farm, in Virginia. Early life and education Hale was born on January 31, 1816, in Crittenden County, Kentucky. His father was a Baptist minister, a South Carolinian, who married a Miss Manahan, of the same state. He was a graduate of Cumberland University, came to Alabama around 1837, and taught school in Greene County for a year. He read law while teaching school, and in 1839 graduated from the law school at Lexington, Kentucky. Locating in Eutaw, he practiced at different times in association with Alexander Graham and T.C. Clarke. Political career In 1843 he was elected to the State legislature from Greene County. After serving his term in the house, he met and married Mary Kirksey on June 12, 1844Greene County, Alabama, Marriages, 1823–1860 and retired to private life until the outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846, when he volunteered and was elected lieutenant of a company.

He was the nominee of his party for congress in 1853, but was defeated; was elected to the legislature again in 1857; was re-elected in 1859; and was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Alabama in 1859. In December 1860, Hale, who was Alabama's commissioner to State of Kentucky at the time, wrote to that state's governor of Alabama's justification for secession. In it, he voiced support for the Dred Scott decision, condemned the Republican Party, and stated that the state's secession, which would perpetuate slavery, was the only way to prevent prospective freedmen, whom Hale referred to as \\"half-civilized Africans\\", from raping southern \\"wives and daughters\\": American Civil War When the secession ordinance was passed, he was appointed commissioner to Kentucky by Governor Moore and delivered an able address before the legislation at Frankfort. That same year, he was elected to represent his district in the provisional congress of the Confederacy. While holding that position, he was chosen as a lieutenant colonel of the 11th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and repaired with it to Virginia. He remained with that command until after the battle of Seven Pines, when he was temporarily assigned to the Ninth Alabama regiment and led it into battle. The fall of Col.

It was originally the third and final book in The Mysterious Benedict Society series. However, in 2019, it was announced that the title would be followed by a new adventure, The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Riddle of Ages. Plot summary In the third installment of the Mysterious Benedict Society series, Reynie, Sticky, Kate, Constance, and various loved ones find themselves holed up in Mr. Benedict's house, which is teeming with security. The evil Mr. Curtain is at large and hunting for the Whisperer—now in Mr. Benedict's possession—so he can control minds from afar. When a shady businessman shows up with false records claiming that he is Constance's father, Mr. Benedict is compelled to use the Whisperer to uncover her short past. Distraught and confused after all is revealed that she is an orphan, Constance runs away, with the whole household after her—just the distraction Mr. Curtain and his men need to steal the Whisperer and set his evil plans into motion. Of course, the rest of the Mysterious Benedict Society soon find themselves on his trail. Soon, Reynie receives messages telling him a code number. He realizes it is a library code number, and Sticky tells them that that book's only copy is located in a library. They find Constance and an apparent clue to where the Whisperer is, but it turns out to be a trap. They are captured by Mr. Curtain. Kate makes several attempts to escape but does not prevail. Finally, their various loved ones come to the rescue, particularly Milligan, who fights McCracken, leader of Mr. Curtain's team of \\"Ten Men\\". Realizing that he is now bound for defeat Mr. Curtain attempts suicide, but S.Q. prevents him out of love. In the end Mr. Curtain is arrested and sent to prison. Milligan retires, Constance is adopted by Mr. Benedict, and the families settle in the first and second floor of Mr. Benedict's house. (Or in Sticky's case, across the street.) The Whisperer was then later disabled by Mr. Benedict. His narcolepsy is later cured by Constance, thanks to her unusual gifts. Characters Reynard \\"Reynie\\" Muldoon is a twelve- year-old living with his tutor and adopted mother, Miss Perumal, who is teaching him Tamil. He is the main character in the Benedict Society series. Exceptionally bright, Reynie looks between the lines, observing and questioning, and gets past most obstacles by finding the \\"puzzle\\" within the situation. Reynie is an especially average-looking boy with average brown hair, average pale complexion, average clothes, and average height. He resides in the home of Mr. Benedict with his mother and friends Constance, Sticky, and Kate because the government has issued that the 4 children be placed in hiding because of threat of kidnapping and worse from the nefarious Ledroptha Curtain. He handles Constance better than Kate, and Sticky. George \\"Sticky\\" Washington is also a twelve-year-old boy. He is characterized by his intelligence and ability to remember everything he reads—hence his nickname, for everything sticks in his mind. He strongly prefers this nickname to his given name, George Washington. Sticky ran away from his home after feeling that he is not wanted by his parents and lived near a river, but is now living in Mr. Benedict's home along with his parents. He has tea-colored skin and is bald because he used hair remover to disguise himself. Sticky also has a bad habit of polishing his spectacles whenever he gets nervous. Sticky also ran away, because his brain needed a rest from contests and his parents were forcing him to do work to get money. His family spent a fortune finding Sticky, leaving them very poor. His mother is wheel-chair bound and his father does not speak a lot. Kate \\"The Great Kate Weather Machine\\" Wetherall is an energetic fourteen-year-old girl who became an orphan as a young child when her mother died and her father left her. She found out that Mr. Benedict's spy, Milligan, is her father, and lived with him on a farm until she and her father had to go into hiding. Kate finds any and all shortcuts in a conflict, and carries a red metal bucket which houses a great many things which she uses to overcome obstacles and evade capture. She owns a trained peregrine falcon named Madge (short for Her Majesty the Queen). Included in her bucket is a Swiss Army knife and a rope. She is very physically capable and almost fearless, often rushing into things without giving them a second thought. She has long, blond hair and light blue eyes. Constance Contraire is the fourth child of the group. She is three years old, the youngest of the four. At the end of the first book (The Mysterious Benedict Society ) Mr. Benedict decides to adopt her. Though she at first does not appear to have any special abilities, her bravery and stubbornness ultimately prove to be a great asset because of her special attention to detail. What is also amazing is that Constance had the ability to read, write, and speak when she was just about the age of two. Also an orphan, her parents died in a train crash and, at a young age, wandered off and lived in a library storage room. Constance can detect patterns in things, and though it may seem like she is psychic, Constance merely recognized patterns and unknowingly can predict the near future. She has wispy blonde hair and very clear blue eyes. Constance's young age explains her frequent napping and obstinacy. Constance also has other abilities, including the ability of extra-sensory perception and the ability to change people's minds. But, as a result of changing their minds, she gets very sick and very stressed out, as ill or worse as if she had the flu. Mr. Nicholas Benedict is a little older than middle-aged man who recruits the children that later call themselves the Mysterious Benedict Society. He is the one who discovered the plans of his identical twin brother, Ledroptha Curtain, who he was separated from just after birth because their parents had died. However, none of his colleagues believed him and called him crazy. Mr. Benedict suffers from narcolepsy, which causes him to fall asleep when experiencing strong emotions (usually laughter, but Constance Contraire cures him of his narcolepsy using her psychic abilities). Mr. Ledroptha Curtain is Mr. Benedict's evil twin brother, who has kidnapped Mr. Benedict and Number Two in the attempt of taking over the world. He wears silver glasses and green plaid suits, and usually makes his way around in a motorized wheelchair. Like his brother, he suffers from narcolepsy, but his condition is triggered by anger, where as Mr. Benedict's is triggered by strong emotion. Rhonda Kazembe is Mr. Benedict's adopted daughter. She comes from a country in Africa (Zambia) and spoke Bembi as a child. She is also, like Number Two (shown below) an assistant to Mr. Benedict, and catches Mr. Benedict when his narcolepsy makes him fall asleep unconsciously. Number Two is Mr. Benedict's assistant and adopted daughter. She doesn't sleep very much, and as such needs a high food intake. Her real name is revealed as Pencilla in this book by Constance, who tricked her by reminding her that she hasn't told her real name, and then reading her mind. She also dresses like a pencil, she has red hair, a yellowish complexion and always wears yellow. Milligan was a spy captured by Mr. Curtain. Though his memories were erased by Mr. Curtain, he managed to escape and eventually became Mr. Benedict's bodyguard. However, when the four children are in danger and he desperately needs to save them, that triggers his memory and is revealed to be Kate's father. Milligan owns a tranquilizer gun to protect himself and others from the Ten Men. When the necessary time came, Milligan jumped onto McCracken (off of a three-story building) to save the children and give them a head start to defeat Mr. Curtain. S.Q. Pedalian is Mr. Ledroptha Curtain's private assistant. Although he is rather a dim-witted orphan, he has a kind heart. In this book he realizes that Mr. Curtain had removed his memories of Mr. Curtain using the Whisperer for evil. When Mr. Curtain orders him to harm and capture the members of the Mysterious Benedict Society, he disobeys, because he doesn't want Mr. Curtain to become free and continue his evil deeds. In the end, S.Q. saves Mr. Curtain's life from his attempted suicide, and visits him daily in the Stonetown Prison. Moocho Brazos is Mr. Benedict's chef. He was once in the circus with Kate, but now is a member of Mr. Benedict's team. In the last book, he helped Kate and Milligan on the Wetherall farm. He is known for his famous apple pies. Ten Men are Mr. Curtains henchmen who only work for him for money, they have little to no loyalty to him if he didn't pay them. In this book we meet six ten men, four of which we already knew. McCracken who is the leader of the ten men and also the most dangerous, Crawling who is the most careless and also has one eyebrow, Garrett who is muscular and has a bushy beard, Sharpe who is also tall and has glasses. In this book we meet Blugins who is more eccentric of a Ten Men than the others. The times we see him in this book he is either going above and beyond in his technique or holding/wearing something expensive. Reception Booklist stated \\"Displaying much of the charm of the first book, this would make a fitting end to the series, but the Society's legion of fans probably wouldn't say no to more.\\" while the School Library Journal wrote \\"the story lacks the facile agility of its predecessors. On the other hand, the opening gambit is fresh and frightfully funny ... If this is the last Society installment, readers had better, as Reynie says, \\"acquire a taste for the bittersweet.\\"\\" Common Sense Media wrote \\"But the story takes awhile to get going (the first 100 pages could have been condensed to 20),\\" and \\"A few more surprises and twists would have been welcome. Not that the simpler story will keep fans away -- and once the action picks up in the last third, kids will definitely be engaged.\\"  References  # # # Trenton Lee Stewart; The Mysterious Benedict Society and The Prisoner's Dilemma; MT Books, Little, Brown; 2009  External links  Category:2009 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:2009 children's books ","title":"The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma"},{"id":"22806918","text":"Port Kenyon is an unincorporated community in Humboldt County, California.

In the mid to late sixties, the first ideas about locating the Club to Keilor were formed. It was a hard and painstaking process which brought the club into severe difficulties. The club was allocated some land at Keilor Park Reserve in 1974 and held its first working bee in 1975.

Special Assignment Air Mission Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) are aircraft operated by units other than by the 89th Airlift Wing to satisfy a requirement needing special pickup or delivery at locations other than those established within the approved channel structure; or to satisfy a requirement needing special consideration because of the number of passengers, weight, or size of the cargo, urgency, or sensitivity of movement, or other special factors. These missions are designated: * PHOENIX BANNER – SAAM supporting the President of the United States (POTUS); primary aircraft employs call sign of \\"Air Force One\\" when POTUS is aboard. * PHOENIX SILVER – SAAM supporting the Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS); primary aircraft employs call sign of \\"Air Force Two\\" when VPOTUS is aboard. * PHOENIX COPPER – SAAM supporting the United States Secret Service (USSS) when not supporting the President or Vice President, i.e., SAAM for the First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS), etc. Standby force definitions are expanded as follows when constituted in support of PHOENIX BANNER or PHOENIX SILVER missions: * BRAVO Standby. Aircraft and aircrew capable of departing 3+00 hours after notification for C-130 and C-17 and 3+45 hours for C-5. * ALFA Standby. Aircraft and aircrew capable of departing 1+00-hour after notification for C-130, and C-17 and 1+45 hours for C-5. To support short-notice PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER missions, AMC maintains aircraft and augmented aircrews on standby at various locations. Specific missions may require standby C-5, C-17, or C-130 aircraft. When the cargo load requires a C-5 (i.e., airlift of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters in the \\"Marine One\\" role operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron ONE (HMX-1)), a C-5 will be used to back up the mission. Aircraft selected to fly these missions must meet the highest standards of reliability and must not have an uncorrected history of repeat or recurring malfunctions. Missions are extensively coordinated and any delay has serious effect on mission support. PHOENIX BANNER, PHOENIX SILVER, and PHOENIX COPPER missions are of high level interest and must get special attention in accordance with established CLOSE WATCH procedures. Any problems that affect the mission will be immediately brought to the attention of the 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) for AMC controlled assets or the theater Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) in a theater Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) for theater controlled assets.

It was redesigned as the 21st Transport Transition Training Detachment of Air Transport Command (ATC) in 1942, and later redesignated as the 26th Transport Group. From September to December 1943, the 26th TG conducted the C-87 \\"Fireball\\" run, a weekly priority spare parts delivery flight between Fairfield, Ohio and Agra, India. It was lastly redesignated as the 503d Army Air Force Base Unit (AAFBU) in 1944. The last unit was part of the ATC North Atlantic Division. In 1946, it is known that the 503d AAFBU was involved in the transport of personnel to Bikini Atoll as part of the Atomic Bomb Testing mission. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt flew to the Casablanca Conference in 1943 on board a commercial Boeing 314 Clipper Ship, he became the first U.S. president to fly while in office. Concerned about relying upon commercial airlines to transport the president, the USAAF leaders ordered the conversion of a military aircraft to accommodate the special needs of the Commander in Chief. In 1942, a modified B-24 Liberator (designated C-87A) was prepared for the use of President Roosevelt, however it was never used by him. The First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, however used the aircraft extensively in her travels around the United States and overseas to visit servicemen overseas. After experiencing difficulties with the C-87, the USAAF arranged with Douglas Aircraft to construct a new transport aircraft specifically for presidential use. Nicknamed the \\"Sacred Cow\\", this modified C-54 Skymaster (VC-54C), which included a vertical lift in the lower fuselage for the President and his wheelchair, became the first military aircraft to transport a U.S. president when President Roosevelt took it to the Soviet Union for the Yalta Conference in February 1945. President Roosevelt used the Sacred Cow only once before his death in April 1945; however, the Sacred Cow remained in presidential service during the first 27 months of the Truman Administration. On 26 July 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 while on board the Sacred Cow. This act established the U.S. Air Force as an independent service, making the Sacred Cow the \\"birthplace\\" of the USAF. Following the increased development of commercial air travel after World War II, Americans once again took to the air. Commercial airlines, made anemic under prohibitive wartime flying regulations and rationing of airplane fuel, were restored to vigor after the war with many World War II military aircraft being sold cheap to anyone with an idea to open an airway in the sky. The result was too many civilian aircraft and not enough airfields to support them. This meant many government civilians couldn't get to where they needed to go on time. The Special Air Mission was created to ensure military airplanes were available to transport government employees between military bases. SAM Aircraft also had priority to land at civilian airfields, although this practice became less common as years went on. The 503d Army Air Forces Base Unit was responsible for the operation of Presidential Aircraft until 27 September 1947 when the United States Air Force was created. At that time, the unit was redesignated as the 503d Air Force Base unit. The unit was nicknamed as the \\"Brass Hat Squadron\\". The 16th (later 1100th) Special Air Missions Group was created in 1948 and assigned to the newly created Military Air Transport Service. The mission of the group was to transport civilian government employees for Air Force and non-Air Force activities as directed by Air Force headquarters. The group consisted of eight squadrons, each strategically located adjacent to the headquarters of the agencies utilizing transportation furnished by the squadrons. This included the transportation of the President of the United States, the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, members of Congress, and other high-ranking American and foreign dignitaries. In 1947, USAAF officials ordered the 29th production DC-6 to be modified as a replacement for the aging VC-54C Sacred Cow presidential aircraft. On 4 July 1947, a VC-118, a military version of the Douglas DC-6 commercial airliner, came into use. It differed from the standard DC-6 configuration in that the aft fuselage was converted into a stateroom; the main cabin seated 24 passengers or could be made up into 12 \\"sleeper\\" berths. The VC-118 was nicknamed \\"Independence\\" for the President Harry Truman's hometown in Missouri. In September 1947, this USAAF aircraft became a USAF aircraft with the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service. Probably the plane's most historic flight occurred when it carried President Truman to Wake Island in October 1950 to discuss the Korean situation with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. In May 1953, after nearly six years of White House service, the Independence was retired as a presidential aircraft and subsequently served several Air Force organizations as a VIP transport. President Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled aboard the \\"Columbine II\\" and \\"Columbine III\\" from 1953 to 1961. This was a modified C-121 Constellation commercial transport, designated as a VC-121E, and was President Eisenhower's personal airplane between 1954 and 1961. Mrs. Eisenhower christened it Columbine III in honor of the official flower of Colorado, her adopted home state, in ceremonies on 24 November 1954. Columbine III served as the presidential aircraft until President Eisenhower left office in January 1961. It remained in service transporting government officials and visiting foreign dignitaries throughout the world until 1966. A 1953 incident where Eisenhower's aircraft was \\"Air Force 8610\\" and an Eastern Airlines plane was \\"Eastern 8610\\" created the need to devise a unique call sign. The call sign \\"Air Force One\\" was classified during the 1950s to identify not only the president's plane, but when he was aboard. In September 1961, it became popularly known when it identified President John F. Kennedy flying aboard his C-118. In 1961, the 1254th Air Transport Wing was moved from Washington National Airport to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, where it was later disestablished in January 1966. In its place, the 89th MAW Special Missions was activated and assigned to Andrews Air Force Base until the wing became a group on 30 September 1977. In 1962, a VC-137C specifically purchased for use as Air Force One, entered into service with the tail number 26000. It is perhaps the most widely known and most historically significant presidential aircraft. SAM 26000 flew President John F. Kennedy to West Berlin in 1963, where he declared to West Berliners, \\"Ich bin ein Berliner,\\" assuring them of continuing United States support in the face of Communist threats and the construction of the Berlin Wall. Kennedy also flew aboard SAM 26000 to Dallas, Texas, where he was assassinated on 22 November 1963—and it was on this airplane that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the new president. SAM 26000 then carried John F. Kennedy's body and President Johnson back to Washington, D.C. Johnson also used 26000 to visit U.S. troops in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Beginning in 1970, President Nixon's national security advisor, Dr. Henry Kissinger, used the aircraft for 13 trips to Paris, France, for secret meetings with the North Vietnamese. In February 1972 President Nixon flew aboard SAM 26000 on his historic \\"Journey for Peace\\" to the People's Republic of China (the first visit by an American president to China). In May 1972 SAM 26000 carried Nixon to the Soviet Union. SAM 26000 was augmented in December 1972 by another VC-137, Special Air Mission 27000, with SAM 26000 retained as an alternate Air Force One aircraft until it was finally retired in 1998. Richard Nixon was the first president to use SAM 27000, and the newer VC-137 served every president until it was replaced by the two VC-25 aircraft (SAM 28000 and 29000) in 1990. However, SAM 27000 continued to remain in service as an Air Force Two and alternate Air Force One aircraft until retired in 2001. In October 1981 the aircraft flew presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter, and former Secretary of State Dr. Kissinger to the funeral of the slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. In March 1983, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom flew on SAM 26000 during her trip to the United States when she visited the West Coast. At a nationally televised event in May 1998, the USAF retired SAM 26000. This aircraft provided 36 years of service and accumulated more than 13,000 flying hours. SAM 27000 was similarly retired in August 2001. The current Special Air Mission for presidential travel used a modified Boeing 747-200B (VC-25). The two aircraft currently in U.S. service are highly modified, to include EMP hardening of all communications and avionics systems and an aerial refueling capability allowing the ability to refuel from USAF KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender, and the soon-to-enter-inventory KC-46 Pegasus aircraft. The VC-25s carry tail numbers 28000 and 29000. Although the Air Force One designation technically applies to the planes only while the President is aboard, the term is commonly applied to the VC-25s more generally. They often operate in conjunction with Marine One, a Marine Corps helicopter, typically a VH-3D Sea King, operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron ONE (HMX-1), which ferries the President to airports or other locations in circumstances where a vehicle motorcade would be inappropriate.

(c.1796 – 24 December 1863) Art in Scotland - Its Origin and Progress. By Robert Brydall, 1889. was a prolific Scottish artist known for his comic depictions of cosy domestic scenes in romantic-era Scotland and England. He also illustrated works of various authors including Sir Walter Scott and Robert Burns.  Early life  Little is known at this time of his family and early education. He was born in Scotland in 1796. At an early age he was apprenticed to James Howe (30 August 1780 – 11 July 1836) who was an Edinburgh artist known for his depictions of domestic animals. One of Kidd's earliest pieces, \\"Cobbler's Shop by W. Kidd, aged 13 years, apprentice to J. Howe\\" was exhibited in Edinburgh in 1809 at the first exhibition of the Associated Artists.The Royal Scottish Academy 1826-1916. By W. D. McKay, R.S.A.The Scottish School of Painting. By W. D. McKay, R.S.A. 1906. Other pieces of the period include The Travelling Showman, Head of Cowgate, Flesh Caddie and various portraits of horses which won him some slight praise from critics of the period.The Scots Magazine and Edinburgh Literary Miscellany. Remarks on the Edinburgh Exhibition of Painting, 1815, pg 334. Kidd later apprenticed with Gavin Beugo, a house painter and decorator. David Roberts, R.A. was a fellow-apprentice of Beugo and lifelong friend.The Life of David Roberts, R.A.: compiled from his journals and other sources. By James Ballantine and David Roberts, 1866. Kidd first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1817 and his pieces were seldom absent from the Academy until about 1840.Scottish painters: a critical study. By Walter Armstrong, 1888. In approximately 1820, Kidd moved to London, as did many young aspiring artists of his time. Perhaps he was responding to the accolades from the critics who stated he: \\"…is on the high road to excellence in his particular department.\\" The European Magazine and London Review, June 1820, pg 509. In the 1820s he began to explore and develop his comic depictions of domestic scenes. His clever humour and dramatic figure painting brought considerable praise and attracted the attention of many period authors and artists of note. His works of this period, 1820–1835, were compared to contemporary Sir David Wilkie, and many of his pieces were being turned into engravings for publications in books. Kidd was clearly influenced by the likes of Wilkie, William Allan and Alexander Carse; earlier proponents of the Scots genre painting. Kidd's paintings of the period are often bright displays of homely scenes of peasant life, \\"the peasant with a cosy cottage, where a certain comfort surrounds the perennial making of love and butter, excited his easy interest.\\" His use of vibrant colours combined with a distracting use of cluttered detail brings a certain familiarity to his works so that the viewer has the distinct impression that they have seen the piece previously. The humour in Kidd's paintings is often subtle and unpretentious and maybe overlooked in the context of the myriad of details within his pieces. William D. McKay expressed it best when he wrote \\"most of Kidd's work, verging on vulgarity, shows much excellent painting in the central group. The composition suffers from the overcrowding of the subsidiary parts.\\"  Middle period  While the early artistic life of Kidd was clearly not easy, the period 1835-1855 was probably the most difficult for Kidd as an artist. During this period he illustrated several scenes from novels by Sir Walter Scott and poems from Robbie Burns. This was a common theme amongst period artists, their \\"bread and butter\\" for income, and has been referred to as \\"the great age of Scott painting.\\" Paintings from books: art and literature in Britain, 1760-1900. By Richard Daniel Altick, 1985. Another common theme of this time was various images of the Greenwich and Chelsea pensioners, the survivors of Trafalgar and Waterloo. It may have been that Kidd accompanied James Howe and Alexander Carse on their visit to the battlefield of Waterloo in 1815.Dictionary of Scottish Art and Architecture. By Peter J.M. McEwan, 1994. Or he may have been copying earlier themes from Wilkie. Some of his work during this period met with some acclaim but much went unrewarded; exhibited time and time again in Liverpool, Edinburgh and London. His pieces of this period sold for a few British pounds, whereas earlier pieces had sold for several guineas. In the 1830s Kidd seemed to be perpetually moving and unsettled even though he was still quite prolific. Later critics write: \\"William Kidd…gave more promise in his youth than was fulfilled in after-years, on account of neglecting his own interest\\" which suggests that he spent much of his time drinking and carousing. This is mirrored by Walter Armstrong who says: \\"Kidd was vulgar, reckless, and a bit of a genius…\\" However, on 6 September 1842, in Old Church, Saint Pancras, London, Kidd married Jane Lindsay Carphin, née Hay, relict of John Carphin and began a new domestic life. The Carphin family was also from Edinburgh and had moved to London about the same time as Kidd. The children of Mrs. Carphin were merchant ship masters and the family had some financial resources. For several years Kidd's life was somewhat more stable. In 1849 Kidd was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy, however, it would appear that Kidd had used up the family funds by that time and his letters to Patrick Allan begin to sound desperate in their appeal for funds. He writes: \\"dire necessity (of) being completely driven up into a corner, but finding I must be obliged to make a sacrifice of some of my pictures. As times are so bad and nothing selling, I have not received any money since I had it from your dear self.\\"Letters from William Kidd to Patrick Allan held by Hospitalfield Trust, Arbroath, Scotland. In letters to Allan in 1853 he mentioned he had not recovered from illness suffered seven years previously. The sons of artist Benjamin Robert Haydon (1786–1846) provide further insight into this mysterious illness, \\"Kidd went mad shortly after my father's death from horror and Fred saw him in Hanwell Asylum in '47-8. Frank Haydon.\\"The Diary of Benjamin Robert Haydon, 1963, pg 323. B.R. Haydon had attempted suicide by shooting himself however when the bullet failed to kill him he completed the task with his straight razor.Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon, historical painter, from his autobiography and journals. By Tom Taylor, 1853 The poverty and events of Haydon's life were too familiar subjects to his friend Kidd. Additional events in the early 1850s further contributed to his continued decline. In 1851, John Henry Pegg, a lawyer and husband of his stepdaughter Isobella, died. Isobella and her two children moved back to London to live with her mother and Kidd. In 1852, his stepson, Captain John Carphin, was killed in a gunfight in California and his other stepson, George Carphin first mate of the Eglinton, was shipwrecked on the coast of Australia. The news of these events, Kidd's lingering mental illness and the failing finances may have contributed to the death of Kidd's wife and she died in July 1854 leaving Kidd alone with the burden of a stepdaughter and two stepgrandchildren.  Later years  From about 1855 through to his death on 24 December 1863, Kidd painted very little, if at all. Any pieces that may have been done during this period were probably replicates or re-workings of earlier pieces. Furthermore, it seems that during this period his stepdaughter was taking care of him due to his failing health. Kidd and his stepdaughter continued to send letters to beg for funds from various persons within the Royal Scottish Academy. Upon hearing of Kidd's death, David Roberts, R.A., in his diary writes: \\"Poor fellow, he was one of those sons of genius quite incapable of managing his worldly affairs, and had lived from hand to mouth, as the saying is, all his days. All my attempts to help him seemed to have no effect; but latterly, with £50 yearly from the Academy and other helps, he must have been as well off as he ever had been at any former period of his life.\\" Kidd's contemporaries had high praise for his work. Roberts states: \\"By far the best artist among them was my late friend William Kidd, who afterwards painted many excellent pictures, embodying the humour and pathos of Scottish life in a most delightful manner.\\" McKay recounts Kidd \\"seems never to have had much success, though his works reveal a talent which ought to have given him a high rank amongst painters.\\" Unfortunately, Kidd's pieces failed to have a lasting impact on the art world. Walter Armstrong in his book, Scottish Painters: a critical study, harshly but correctly states \\"Kidd's pictures are almost, if not quite, unknown in galleries. They are to be met with pretty frequently in the dealers' shops, where they are often called by other names. I must confess that only at rare intervals have I found myself confronted by one that deserved a place even in the most liberal 'National Gallery of British Art'.\\" That being said, today examples of Kidd's labours can be found in the Patrick Allan-Fraser Hospitalfield Trust in Arbroath, Scotland; in the Burns Monument Trust; the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh; the Tyne and Wear Museums; and in Leeds Museums and Galleries.

The project involved the building of an extra pair of tracks from Southern Cross station to Sunshine, parallel to the Western line, and a new double-track line from Deer Park, which joins with the Warrnambool line west of Werribee, near the site of the former Manor railway station. New stations were built at Tarneit and Wyndham Vale, while West Footscray and Sunshine stations were rebuilt. Additional platforms were built at Southern Cross and Footscray stations, and two level crossings near Sunshine were replaced by grade separations. The most used station before its construction, North Melbourne, was excluded from the project despite being the main connection hub for regional travellers not needing to go all the way to Southern Cross, and now requires regional rail link customers to change at Footscray. The project was managed by the Regional Rail Link Authority, on behalf of the Victorian Government, and, at the time, was the largest transport infrastructure project being undertaken in Australia.Australia's largest public transport project leaps ahead Premier of Victoria 21 December 2011 Construction commenced in 2009 and was fully completed in June 2015, with the opening of the section of track from Manor junction to Deer Park West junction. According to the 2012 PTV Network Development Plan, by December 2032 the RRL will be part of an electrified line from Grovedale, Geelong to South Yarra railway station, with a branch line to Avalon Airport, thereby integrating the Geelong line into the metropolitan system. History Footscray station in May 2014 West Footscray station in May 2014 Sunshine station in May 2014 Tarneit station before opening in June 2015 Wyndham Vale station before opening in June 2015 =Background= Following the rail infrastructure improvements provided by the Regional Fast Rail project, and subsequent growth in passengers and services, there was an increase in congestion in the Melbourne suburban area, where trains operated by V/Line shared tracks with Metro Trains Melbourne suburban trains, caused increasing delays on rail services. Late running by V/Line or metropolitan rail services affected the reliability of other trains, and V/Line trains, running express through most suburban stations, limited the frequency, and affected the timekeeping, of stopping suburban trains. After major disruptions each operator might blame the other for causing the problem. A separate line for regional trains between Geelong and Melbourne, then called the \\"Tarneit Link\\", was included as a possible long-term rail option in the Bracks government's 2006 Meeting Our Transport Challenges report. Costed at around $500 million, the link was also recommended in Rod Eddington's East-West Link Needs Assessment study, released in April 2008. By November 2008 the link between Deer Park and West Werribee was estimated to cost $1.5 billion. =Official status= The project was expanded and re-branded as the Regional Rail Link when announced as part of the Brumby Government's Victorian Transport Plan of December 2008.Regional Rail Link to Streamline Train Services Premier of Victoria 8 December 2008 With a revised aim of separating all regional trains between Southern Cross and Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo, from suburban rail movements, the proposed route was from Southern Cross through Sunshine and Tarneit to West Werribee. In May 2009 the project reached full funding, gaining the required allocation of $3.2 billion from the 2009 Federal budget, adding to funds to be provided by the Victorian Government.Regional Rail Work to Start this Year after $4 Billion Project Secures Federal Funding Premier of Victoria 14 May 2009 Several route options were investigated. One proposal involved the acquisition of up to 49 properties in Railway Place, Footscray to widen the existing railway corridor, and local residents launched a campaign against that proposal in May 2010. Other options floated were the sharing of tracks with freight trains in the existing Bunbury Street tunnel, or the construction of a second rail tunnel under Footscray A preliminary route between Sunshine and Werribee was released for public consultation in June 2009.Proposed Route of Regional Rail Link Revealed Premier of Victoria 17 June 2009 In July 2010, the final route through Footscray was announced by the state government. Heading away from Melbourne, the pair of Regional Rail Link tracks run south of the current four suburban tracks until after the line has crossed the Maribyrnong River, where a new bridge was built. After crossing the river, the line passes over the top of the Newport bound suburban tracks on a flyover, and then runs between each pair of suburban tracks to Footscray station. At Footscray the line uses the existing platforms 1 and 2 (since renumbered 3 and 4), and then run on resumed land to the south of the suburban line to Sunshine, past Middle Footscray and West Footscray stations. Suburban trains towards Sunshine use the existing tracks except at Footscray, where two new platforms were built north of the four existing platforms. To accommodate the final route, 26 homes and 84 businesses on Buckley Street, Footscray were acquired. Many residents did not find out their homes were to be acquired until told by journalists, waiting up to 24 hours for official notification from Department of Transport representatives. A Government spokeswoman said \\"every effort\\" had been made to contact the households affected, but bureaucrats had abandoned their planned visit to deliver the bad news because they did not want to be filmed by the media. The proposals would also have acquired 136m² the heritage listed HV McKay Memorial Gardens, (Australia's oldest remaining industrial garden) as part of a grade separation along Anderson Road in Sunshine; after community resistance and lobbying by Brimbank City Council, plans were altered to reduce the acquisition of the gardens to approximately 5m². =Baillieu government review= In February 2011, the incoming Baillieu government announced the project was under review, citing poor planning and a blow-out in costs. After the review, the Baillieu government estimated the price tag for the line to be $880 million more than stated by the outgoing Brumby government. In November 2011, the secretary of the Victorian Department of Transport, Jim Betts, admitted that the lack of a mature plan, and the urgency of spending the money provided by the federal government as part of its economic stimulus package, meant that there had been a rush to finalise the financial arrangements of the scheme. He commented that \\"the budget for that project was basically haggled over between the state and the commonwealth one weekend and we end up with a number written on the back of an envelope\\".

In April 2011 the incoming Baillieu government stated it would cost closer to $5 billion and take two years longer to build. In July 2011 the cost was estimated at $5.3 billion with a completion date of 2016. In the 2015/16 State Budget the final cost of the project was given as $3.65 billion, down from the previous estimate of $4.1 billion. However, the final cost of property acquisitions related to the project will not be fully known until December 2018, so this cost estimate may increase. https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/assessing-benefits-regional-rail-link- project =Legacy= All passenger trains on the Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong lines use the Regional Rail Link from Sunshine to Melbourne, solving a lot of the capacity problem, and the conflicts encountered when those services share tracks with metropolitan trains. The link allows more regional and metropolitan trains to run, which, combined with the purchase of new rolling stock, has helped provide additional peak hour passenger capacity on regional services, particularly those from Geelong and Ballarat, and freed up capacity on Melbourne suburban tracks to allow more trains to run. However, far from providing a bypass of the suburban network for Geelong line trains, those services have become suburban trains on the Tarneit section of the RRL, being the only ones which can serve those stations. Tarneit station rapidly became the second busiest on the V/Line network after Southern Cross. That has worsened the chronic overcrowding on peak-hour Geelong trains, as well as slowing of journey times. As a result, there have been calls for the other three planned stations on the Tarneit section of the RRL to be constructed. As part of the project, the partially-built platforms 15 and 16 at Southern Cross station were completed, which increased the number of trains the station can handle. However, no platforms were provided for RRL trains at North Melbourne station, which had been a major interchange point for regional passengers using northern suburban and City Loop trains, as well as the recently- introduced Route 401 bus from North Melbourne to the hospital and university precincts. No reason was given for that decision, and after the RRL opened, passengers wanting to get to North Melbourne had to alight at Footscray or Southern Cross stations and catch another train. =Noise and pollution= Controversy emerged with the release of reports from the Victorian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which criticized the methodology and results contained in assessments submitted by the RRL team to former state planning minister, Justin Madden, as part of the project planning referral. The EPA reports state, \\"in Footscray, for the most exposed residents, a vast majority of the population will experience chronic noise-induced sleep disturbance, with very significant proportions highly disturbed... For the most exposed residents in other areas, almost half the community will experience chronic noise-induced sleep disturbance.\\" The reports also raised concerns about the Footscray Park Railway Reserve where, the EPA predicted, the public would be exposed to dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide from increased diesel train traffic. The EPA noted that planned risk assessments had not been done by the Department of Transport. Madden had viewed the EPA reports in September 2010, but ruled that an Environment Effects Statement (EES) was not required for Section-1 of the RRL project. LinesCriticism Despite the immediate advantage to commuters in the Wyndham Vale and Tarneit areas, there has been some disappointment regarding the irregular spacing of services at these stations. For example, on Monday to Friday morning services, there is a 26-minute gap between the 8:42 AM and the 9:08 AM city-bound trains at Tarneit Station. Ballarat line passengers have been particularly upset about their services since the full opening of the RRL. Due to a rolling stock shortage, some Ballarat trains had fewer carriages than before, and timekeeping of services worsened, despite the promise of greater reliability after the RRL opened. Following the opening of the Regional Rail Link, V/Line trains on the Ballarat line failed to meet punctuality targets for 14 consecutive months.https://www.vline.com.au/About-V-Line/Additional- pages/Past-performance Despite Allen Garner, former CEO and COO of the Regional Rail Link Authority, saying there were \\"no new level crossings\\" along the whole Regional Rail Link route, three were left in place along the former Serviceton line in Deer Park, which Geelong line trains now travel on. The extra services introduced as a result of RRL meant the crossing gates were down for longer, which heavily increased traffic in the area and drew criticism from residents and lobby groups. However, when the Andrews government revised their 2014 election commitment of removing 50 of the most dangerous and congested level crossings to include a further 25 level crossings at the 2018 state election, all 3 of them got included and will be removed. https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/new-regional-rail-link- timetable-creating-traffic-nightmare-at-level-crossing/news- story/8d29c8fcb3935162f66400ac3c85767e In January 2016, V/Line suddenly withdrew half of its V/locity fleet due to wheel wear issues. The lack of rolling stock meant passengers were forced to use buses and the government ended up having to give passengers a whole month of free travel. An independent report done into the wheel wear issues found the major cause of the problem was tight curves on the RRL route, particularly on the North Melbourne flyover (NMFO), which was upgraded as part of RRL as a means of allowing V/line trains to travel through North Melbourne on a separate route to Metro trains https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/vline-woes- continue-with-poor-january-report-with-more-than-one-in-10-services- cancelled/news-story/11fff06097fd8e85f1ab2c103d9630c4 In May 2018, the Victorian Auditor-General completed an audit on the Regional Rail Link, titled \\"Assessing Benefits from the Regional Rail Link Project\\" https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/assessing-benefits-regional-rail-link- project While acknowledging that the project has had significant benefits, some of them unexpected, the Auditor-General slammed the State Government's of the time, the former Victorian Department of Transport and the Regional Rail Link Authority for its mismanagement of the project, particularly in the planning stages. https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/assessing-benefits- regional-rail-link-project He noted that the lack of any formal business case for the project made it extremely difficult to determine just what the benefits of the project were meant to be, and whether or not the RRL had lived up to the expectations set for it when the project was funded in 2009. He also said that planners had not adequately predicted how many people would use the RRL after its opening, and that the lines designed maximum capacity of 18 trains per-hour would make it difficult to add the number of services which will be required in the future. https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/assessing-benefits-regional-rail-link- project See also * Southern Sydney Freight Line – a similar project in Sydney separating suburban and freight services ReferencesExternal links * YouTube video overview of works Public Transport Victoria Category:Rail transport in Victoria (Australia) Category:Railway lines in Victoria (Australia) Category:V/Line rail services Category:2015 establishments in Australia Category:5 ft 3 in gauge railways in Australia ","title":"Regional Rail Link"},{"id":"22807044","text":"Blue-light Federalist was a derogatory term used by those who believed certain Federalists to have made friendly (\\"blue-light\\") signals to British ships in the War of 1812 to warn the British of American blockade runners, the specific event supposedly happening in 1813, in New London, Connecticut, when Commodore Stephen Decatur saw blue lights burning near the mouth of the New London river in sight of the British blockaders.

History The Stand hosted its first regular club night on Thursday, 21 September 1995, in the small basement of WJ Christie's Bar on West Port in Edinburgh's Old Town. Seven people came and the total box office was £22. The founders, Tommy Sheppard and Jane Mackay, wanted to create a platform for emerging Scottish comedians, as well as a place for people who enjoyed comedy \\"that looks at the world from a slightly different perspective\\". Sheppard had lived in London in the early 80s at the time of the alternative comedy boom and had seen Julian Clary and Jo Brand when they were just starting out in small alternative circuit venues. On his return to Scotland in the 1990s, he had been surprised to discover that there were no equivalent venues here. When The Stand opened a week-round venue in York Place in 1998, it was the first dedicated comedy club in Scotland. The Glasgow venue was opened in 2000, located in the basement of an old secondary school in Woodlands in the West End of the city. The Stand runs live stand-up comedy shows every night of the week in both venues, with a programme of contemporary comedy from Scottish and international comedians. They also stage weekly open mic nights; Monday night in Edinburgh and Tuesday night in Glasgow. The Stand Comedy Club has a mailing list of 22,000 people. In 2009, 10,000 tickets were sold to events between both the Glasgow and Edinburgh venues and roughly 600 acts a year are performed at these clubs every year. Between the two clubs an average of 1600 tickets are sold to events every week.The Stand Comedy Club The venue has banned stag and hen parties, and talking during the performances, in an effort to minimise disruptive behaviour so that the comedians can concentrate upon delivering their crafted material. =Edinburgh Club= The club ran weekly when first set up in 1996 and relied on local talent. Expansion meant a second weekly venue in the Moscow Bar and by the end of 1997 a third weekly club had started. In April 1997 Tommy Sheppard and Jane Mackay formed Salt 'n' Sauce Promotions Ltd. to develop the club on a commercial basis. After two and a half years of moving around and staging shows in different pubs, the club finally settled and moved into a new purpose-built venue on the edge of the city's New Town. The Edinburgh club now stages up to ten shows per week and with its connection with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe it is the fourth largest comedy venue in the world's largest arts festival.Fringe Festival 2010 Programme =Glasgow Club= The Glasgow club opened on 14 April 2000. Initially the Glasgow club was open five nights a week and by 2003 it had joined the Edinburgh club opening 7 nights a week. =Newcastle club= Exterior of The Stand, Newcastle The Stand opened a venue in High Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne on 27 October 2011. The Stand invested £750,000 in fitting out the basement venue, part of the former Waygood complex. As the Newcastle club prepared to open, Tommy Sheppard said that he expects this venue to be the last Stand to open. Famous acts Since becoming a year-round dedicated comedy club, The Stand has been a platform for comedians such as Fred MacAulay, Kevin Bridges,Daily Record Kevin Bridges Interview Des Clarke and Frankie Boyle. Fundraising events Over the year The Stand Comedy Club holds around ten benefit evenings which raises money for various charities such as the Red Cross and Amnesty International. Since 2005, the club has been able to raise money for these charities as the acts performing don't receive a fee and the money is then donated to the selected charity.Celebrity update 2006  British Red Cross New performers The Stand's programme contains an event called Red Raw beginners' night, where new comics can request to be on the bill.http://www.thestand.co.uk/shows.aspx When asked about changes to the club over the years the original founders have noticed that comedy has become more popular as thousands will now go out weekly to see a live show compared to dozens many years ago when The Stand was set up. As a result of the growth in the audience more performers have come through to try comedy out which has seen a three or four-month waiting list to get a spot on the Red Raw bill.Ten Years of the Glasgow Stand  The Skinny Recognition Tourist guides and websites recommend The Stand as a tourist attraction.Visitscotland The Stand Comedy Club Glasgow West End Stand Up Comedy Welcome and the clubs are recognised as contributors to the economy.

Third edition. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1995 : 661–663 – October 12, 1982) was a Mexican geological engineer and politician. Manuel Santillán, the youngest of three sons (Adalberto, the oldest, and Isuaro, in the middle), was born on September 29, 1894, in the Hacienda de Xalostoc (Tlaxco, Tlaxcala), to Calixto Santillan and Manuela Osorno. Santillán finished preparatory studies at Universidad Veracruzana in Jalapa, Veracruz and later received three engineering degrees. The first in geology and geodesic engineering; the second degree in Mining and Metallurgical Engineering; and the third in civil engineering from the School of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Early career He began his career as a mining engineer in Pachuca, Hidalgo in 1919. With Tomas Barrera, Santillán conducted explorations in northern Baja California in 1928. They published their results with a geological map in 1930. Many of the fossils obtained by Santillan and Barrera near Arroyo Santa Catarina were left at the University of California (Loc. 647 U. C. Coll.).Powell Calvert, Philip. \\"The odonate collections of the California Academy of Sciences from Baja California and Tepic, Mexico, of 1889–1894.\\" Proceedings of the California academy of sciences, [San Francisco] 4th ser. 23 . 41(1947) : 603–609 He was named Chief of Geologists for Mining and Petroleum in the Mexican Department of Industry and Commerce in 1929. In April 1929, Leopoldo Salazar Salinas, Director of the Geological Institute of Mexico, commissioned Santillán to study the mineral deposits of Pachuca and their relation to Miocene rocks. He published the report in 1931. From 1931, Santillán and Enrique M. González were the editors the journal Anuario, published by the Instituto de Geología, Geofísica y Geodesia (UNAM). He was the Director of the Geological National Institute (Instituto de Geología, Geofísica y Geodesia) from January 21, 1932, to January 21, 1941. One of his first actions as director was to request the transfer of the duplicates of fossils and minerals, which were guarded by the Secretary Agriculture and Development, to the Geological National Institute (UNAM). In this way began to consolidate Collection of Paleontology at the Institute (Carreño and Montellano-Ballesteros 140).Carreño, Ana Luisa, y Montellano-Ballesteros, Marisol. \\"La Paleontología mexicana; pasado, presente y futuro.\\" Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana, 52 . 2 (2005) : 137–147 Santillán served as consulting Engineer to the Presidency, 1933.

Manuel Santillán was one of the founding members of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad in 1937. State oil expropriationBackground= In December 1933 a Congressional decree established Petróleos de México S.A. (Petromex)--a publicly traded company in which just Mexican nationals could purchase equity—with the purpose of supplying the fuel requirements of the National Railways in particular and the domestic market with petroleum products in general. It was also given the responsibility of regulating the domestic petroleum markets and training Mexican personnel in all aspects of the industry. Petromex lasted only until September 1934, when it was dissolved owing to a lack of interest on the part of the investing public, and the assets and shares of the company were transferred to the Control de Administración del Petróleo Nacional. In November 1936 a law was passed that expropriated for the state all assets considered to be of public utility, including oil and natural gas, and in January 1937 the state-owned Administración General del Petróleo Nacional was created to explore and develop the national reserves that were assigned to it. Manuel Santillán was the Director of the National Petroleum Administration from January 1937 to May 6, 1938.Kluckhohn, Frank L. \\"Britain Again Asks Mexican Payment.\\" New York Times, May 8, 1938 : 35 By 1936, Germany displaced Great Britain, and became the second-largest trading partner of Mexico after the United States. The oil production was a source of great potential importance. The United States was not alien to this process, nor was the Great Britain. Throughout this period the movements of Germany, as well as those of Italy and Japan would be carefully followed by the intelligence services of both nations. In August 1937, the Foreign Office was notified that German and Italian agents were having an active participation in Mexico, even suggesting that the conflict in the oil industry was being funded with money from these nations. A letter written by Baron Von Collenberg, Minister Plenipotentiary of Germany to Mexico, was intercepted by the British Consulate. The letter was addressed to Manuel Santillán, General Director General of the National Petroleum Administration, with intentions of establishing a commercial agreement between Mexico and Germany. The Germans were interested in buying 100,000 barrels of oil type Panuco.

Santa Fe: UNM Press, 1999. =Mexican oil expropriation= In 1938, president Lázaro Cárdenas sided with oil workers striking against foreign-owned oil companies for an increase in pay and social services. On March 18, 1938 citing the 27th article of the 1917 constitution, President Lázaro Cárdenas embarked on the state-expropriation of all resources and facilities, nationalizing the United States and Anglo -Dutch operating companies, creating PEMEX. In retaliation, many foreign governments closed their markets to Mexican oil. In spite of the boycott, PEMEX developed into one of the largest oil companies in the world and helped Mexico become the fifth-largest oil exporter in the world. Governor of Tlaxcala He was Governor of Tlaxcala, from January 15, 1941, to October 4, 1944, and was forced to resign as governor because he tried to oppose the national Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRM Party of the Mexican Revolution) leadership.

The area around Kuhikugu is located in part of the Xingu National Park today. Kuhikugu was first uncovered by anthropologist Michael Heckenberger, working alongside the local Kuikuro people, who are the likely descendants of the original inhabitants of Kuhikugu. Archaeological complex and history In the broad sense, the name refers to an archaeological complex including twenty towns and villages, spread out over an area of around , where close to 50,000 people may have once lived. Kuhikugu was likely inhabited from a period of time around 1,500 years ago to a time as recently as 400 years ago, when the people living there were likely killed by diseases brought over by Europeans. Settlement X11 Strictly speaking, Kuhikugu is settlement X11 of this complex, located near Porto dos Meinacos on the eastern shore of Lake Kuhikugu (now Lagoa Dourada) at . There, as well as at other former settlements of the Kuhikugu complex, satellite imagery reveals that even today the forest differs from surrounding pristine areas, and ground-based exploration reveals this to be an effect of the anthrosol (cf. terra preta), known to the Kuikuro as egepe. Directly to the north of the X11 site there is a Kuikuro village, the small size of which provides an interesting comparison to the large area of egepe which indicates the prehistoric settlement. Large defensive ditches and palisades were built around some of the communities at Kuhikugu.Heckenberger, Michael J.; Kuikuro, Afukaka; Kuikuro, Urissapá Tabata; Russell, J. Christian; Schmidt, Morgan; Fausto, Carlos; and Franchetto, Bruna. \\"Amazonia 1492: Pristine Forest or Cultural Parkland?\\" Science. April 25, 2003. Large plazas also exist at some of the towns throughout the region, some around across. Many of the communities at Kuhikugu were linked, with roads which bridged some rivers along their paths, and with canoe canals running alongside some of the roads. Fields of mandioca (cassava) may have existed around the communities at Kuhikugu, suggesting that the people there were farmers.Heckenberger, Michael J. \\"Manioc Agriculture and Sedentism in Amazonia: The Upper Xingu Example.\\" Antiquity. September 1998. Dams and ponds which appear to have been constructed in the area also suggest that the inhabitants of Kuhikugu may have been involved with fish farming, which is still practised by some of their modern day Kuikuro descendants. The Lost City of Z There is a possibility that legends regarding Kuhikugu may have influenced the British explorer Lieutenant Colonel Percy Fawcett to go on his ill-fated last expedition in 1925, looking through the Amazon rainforest for what he called \\"City Z\\".

Ancient Hawaiians hunted birds and gathered wood extensively on the plateau. They valued both seabirds that nested here for food, and forest birds for colorful feathers used in ceremonial garments. While hunting, they camped in the caves formed by Lava tubes, placing gourds on the floor to collect water that dripped from the ceiling. The forests provided sandalwood and medicinal plants. Bundles of sandalwood were found where they were left for later transport to the larger communities on the coast. Protection The site is state archaeological site number 10-30-5004List of Historic Places in Hawaii County on Hawaii State web site (this number, plus \\"50-\\" to indicate the state of Hawaii, was appended to its name on the National registry). It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 15, 1986 as site number 86001086.

Botanists distinguish between true bulbs, corms, rhizomes, tubers and tuberous roots, any of which may be termed \\"bulbs\\" in horticulture. Bulb species usually lose their upper parts during adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat or winter cold. The bulb's storage organs contain moisture and nutrients that are used to survive these adverse conditions in a dormant state. When conditions become favourable the reserves sustain a new growth cycle. In addition, bulbs permit vegetative or asexual multiplication in these species. Ornamental bulbs are used in parks and gardens and as cut flowers. Terminology The word \\"bulb\\" has a somewhat different meaning to botanists than it does to gardeners and horticulturalists. In gardening, a \\"bulb\\" is a plant's underground or ground-level storage organ that can be dried, stored and sold in this state, and then planted to grow again. Many bulbs in this sense are produced by geophytes – plants whose growing point is below ground level. However, not all bulbs in the gardening sense are produced by geophytes. For example, rhizomatous irises are included in books on ornamental bulbs, but their growing points are above ground. Many bulbs are produced by lilioid monocots, but not all lilioid monocots have bulbs. Brian Mathew says that \\"we just have to accept that there is no accurate term which we can use for this group of plants and we are left with 'bulbs' as the snappiest and most convenient.\\" Botanically, gardeners' \\"bulbs\\" may be true bulbs, corms, rhizomes or tubers, or combinations of these. TypesTrue bulbs= Bulb of a red onion, cut vertically A true bulb (i.e. a bulb in the botanical sense) is an underground vertical shoot that has modified leaves (or thickened leaf bases) that are used as food storage organs by the plant. The bottom of the bulb is made up of a short section of stem forming the basal plate. Storage leaves are produced from the top of the basal plate, roots from the underside. Genera with true bulbs are Muscari, Allium, Tulipa and Narcissus. =Corms= Crocosmia corm, showing solid construction with outer tunic and shoots emerging from the top A corm is a short, vertical, swollen underground plant stem consisting of one or more internodes with at least one growing point, with protective leaves modified into skins or tunics. The thin tunic leaves are dry papery, dead sheaths, formed from the leaves produced the year before. They act as a covering that protects the corm from insects and water loss. Internally a corm is mostly made of starch-containing parenchyma cells above a more-or-less circular basal node that grows roots. Corms are sometimes confused with true bulbs; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, but corms are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales. =Rhizomes= Dried ginger rhizome A rhizome is a horizontal stem that often grows underground, usually sending out roots and shoots from its nodes. Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some Iris species. Usually, rhizomes have short internodes; they send out roots from the bottom of the nodes and new upward- growing shoots from the top of the nodes. Examples of plants that grow in this way include irises, lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) and cannas. =Tubers= Root tubers of Dahlia A stem tuber may form from thickened rhizomes or stolons. The tops or sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves, and the undersides produce roots. Such tubers tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. A below ground stem tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of an underground rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies except for the new offspring stem tubers, which in spring regrow one or more new shoots producing stems and leaves. Some plants also form smaller tubers and/or tubercules, which act like seeds, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers, such as those of tuberous begonias, are long lived, but many tuberous plants have tubers that survive only until the plants are in full leaf, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shrivelled up husk. Roots can also form tuberous structures (tuberous roots) that are in some ways similar to stem tubers, but of a different anatomical origin. Ornamental plants with tuberous roots include the Persian buttercup, Ranunculus asiaticus, and dahlias. When sold in the dry form, dahlia \\"bulbs\\" consist of a cluster of tuberous roots attached to one or more stems. Only the stems produce buds, from around the \\"collar\\" close to where the roots are attached. A tuber without any attached stem will not grow. Tubers may form from the hypocotyl of the young seedling, as in Cyclamen. Since the hypocotyl is a region between the stem and the roots, such tubers are variable in their anatomy and growth habits. Thus the roots of Cyclamen graecum grow from the base of the tuber, suggesting it is a stem tuber, whereas those of Cyclamen hederifolium mostly grow from the upper surface of the tuber, suggesting it is a root tuber. Environmental adaptations and distribution Annual species complete their life cycle during favourable seasons and pass unfavourable ones as seeds. Bulbous plants, on the other hand, have developed storage organs as a reserve to allow them to survive unfavourable conditions in a resting condition in order to begin growth again when environmental conditions become more favourable. The dormant or resting period may be in summer or winter, or may depend on rainfall, as in the tropics. The different strategies enable bulbous plants to survive adverse conditions such as extremely hot and dry summers, very cold winters, or periods of drought. =Summer dormancy= Crocus cartwrightianus flowering on 15 November in Greece Most bulbous plants are adapted to hot, dry summers and cooler, wetter winters. They are dormant through the summer and grow during the autumn, winter and spring. Within this group, there are variations, largely determined by how cold the winter is. Many tulips (Tulipa species) of Asian origins, for example, have adapted to an extreme continental climate, with dry, very hot summers, very cold winters and springs with short showers. They grow mainly during the spring. In cultivation such tulips may be planted in late autumn (e.g. November in the northern hemisphere). In regions where winters are milder, some species, such as Crocus cartwrightianus, flower in the autumn, either at the same time as the leaves appear or before. Others, such as Arum creticum, produce leaves in the autumn which last through the winter until the plant flowers in the spring. Summer drought occurs particularly, but not exclusively, in those regions of the world with a Mediterranean climate, which are rich in bulbous plants. Such regions include the Mediterranean itself through to Central Asia, the south west of South Africa, the south west of Australia, parts of the western United States, such as California, and parts of western South America, particularly Chile. A bluebell wood in Kent, England Many species that grow in the understory of deciduous woods or forests are also summer dormant. They use their stored reserves in order to grow rapidly and complete their annual growth-cycle at the beginning of spring before the developing tree canopy blocks out the sun's light. North America is home to many such woodland bulbs, including Erythronium, Trillium and some lilies, such as Lilium pardalinum. The common bluebell, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, is native to western parts of Europe, but particularly the British Isles, where it carpets the floor of some woods. The woodlands of Asia, including China and Japan, are home to bulbous plants such as arisaemas and the giant cardiocrinums. Some bulbous plants grow in communities that are adapted to recurrent fires during the dry season (for example, many Iridaceae species). During these periods the plants are dormant and in this way can survive the heat of the fire. The fires clean the surface vegetation, eliminating competition and also supplying nutrients to the ground from the ashes of the burnt plants. When the first rains fall, the bulbs, corms and rhizomes rapidly start to shoot, starting a new period of growth and development sustained by the reserves accumulated in their storage tissues during the previous season. Various South African species from the genus Cyrtanthus, for example, are well known for their ability to flower rapidly after natural grassland wildfires, and for this reason several of these species are known as \\"fire lilies\\". In fact, some species, such as Cyrtanthus contractus, only flower after a wildfire. =Winter dormancy= Eucomis comosa, a winter dormant bulbous plant A second category of bulbous plants are those adapted to dry, generally cool winters and warmer, wetter summers. They are dormant through the winter and grow in spring, summer and autumn. Regions of South Africa and Lesotho with this type of climate include the East Cape, and the Drakensberg mountains in the north east of Western Cape province, which are particularly rich in bulbous species, including plants such as gladioli, Eucomis and Rhodohypoxis. Other areas with similar winter drought include parts of Central America, such as Mexico where the tiger flower (Tigridia pavonia) is found. =Seasonal dormancy= In some areas of the tropics, rainfall is interspersed with periods of dryness; more than one wet/dry cycle may occur in a year. Bulbous plants in these areas are adapted to warm, wet periods followed by warm, dry periods. They typically flower near the beginning of the rainy season. Such a climate occurs in Kenya, which has wet conditions in October to December and then again in February to May. Glory-lilies (Gloriosa) and Crinum species are examples of bulbous plants adapted to these conditions. Tropical Asia has similarly adapted bulbous plants, such as species of Hedychium (gingers).  History of use  Plants with fleshy underground parts were probably first used as food. Onions (Allium cepa) were cultivated in Ancient Egypt. In South America, the potato (Solanum tuberosum), oca (Oxalis tuberosa) and the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) were cultivated for thousands of years. Other parts of bulbous plants were also used in cooking. The Minoans of Crete grew and traded saffron (either the wild species Crocus cartwrightianus or the cultivated Crocus sativus). The plant is depicted in paintings from around 1550 BC. Saffron consists of the dried stigmas of the flowers, and is used as a spice and also as a dye. Some bulbous plants were used in medicine in classical times; one example is the sea squill (Drimia maritima) which grows from a true bulb. Lilies on a Bronze Age fresco from excavations at Akrotriri, Santorini, Greece Wall paintings dated to around 1700–1600 BC from Minoan Akrotiri provide some of the earliest evidence for the apparently ornamental use of bulbous plants. Some of the plants in the frescos are clearly lilies, which have usually been identified as Lilium candidum. However, this species has white flowers, and those in the frescos are red, which suggests they may be Lilium chalcedonicum. L. candidum, the Madonna lily, was later used as a symbol in Christianity, where the Virgin Mary was represented with lilies in her hands. The symbol of the Fleur de Lys was originally based on the flower of a species of Iris (Iris pseudacorus) that appeared in Egyptian and Indian religious paintings long before it was adopted as the emblem of the kings of France in the 5th Century. Many ornamental bulbs were introduced into Europe via Turkey and the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (who reigned 1520–1566) was noted for his love of gardens, where tulips and other bulbs were grown. Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, the ambassador to the sultan from Emperor Ferdinand I in Vienna, observed ornamental bulbous plants such as narcissi, hyacinths and \\"those which the Turks call tulipam\\". The botanist Carolus Clusius, who was based in Vienna from 1573 to around 1580, devoted one volume of his 1576 botanical work Rariorum Plantarum Historia to bulbs, some of which he knew from introductions via Turkey, such as tulips, Iris susiana, Galanthus elwesii and Fritillaria persica. Clusius had a major impact on bulb growing in Europe. Through his later position as the Director of the Leiden Botanic Garden, he established the Netherlands as the centre of commercial ornamental bulb growing. It is therefore apparent that bulbous plants have served as food and symbols of religion and royal power for thousands of years. They have also been admired and used for the beauty of their flowers since time immemorial and by many civilizations. The list of the countries that have used bulbous plants as ornaments since the Christian era is long and includes Greece, Egypt, China, Korea and India among others. The list of genera cultivated in these countries as ornamental plants is even longer: Lycoris, Lilium, Crocus, Cyclamen, Narcissus, Scilla, Gladiolus, Muscari, Ranunculus, Allium, Iris and Hyacinthus. Bulbous plants in the garden Young Narcissus shoots Some varieties of bulbous plants thrive under adverse conditions such as poor soil or shade, and are therefore well suited to use in a garden. Varieties can be chosen that bloom at various times of year. They can be intermingled with other plants, used in pots, or even placed in the lawn or underneath fruit trees. Regarding their size, it is possible to find species that only grow a few centimetres such as Crocus minimus up to examples of 3.6m such as Cardiocrinum giganteum. While some bulbs are poisonous or at least inedible to humans, many bulbs – especially those of the onion family (leeks, garlic, chives, shallots) – are grown both privately and commercially as food crops. The onion especially provides the basis for a huge variety of dishes. = Flowerbeds and borders = Bulb species are traditionally planted in flowerbeds (parterres) and herbaceous borders in parks and gardens. The selection of species to plant depends on various factors, such as the soil type, the position (sunny or shady location), the colour or effect that is required and the season of the year when the plants are required to flower. pansies Some examples of bulbous plant genera and their flowering season are given below: * Spring flowering bulbs. Spring is the most typical season for bulbs to flower. Some examples are: Allium, Arum, Asphodelus, Camassia, Convallaria, Crocus, Cyclamen, Eranthis, Freesia, Fritillaria, Galanthus, Hyacinthus, Hippeastrum, Iris, Ixia, Leucojum, Muscari, Narcissus, Ornithogalum, Ranunculus, Scilla, Trillium and Tulipa and Zephyranthes. * Summer flowering bulbs: Achimenes, Agapanthus, Allium, Alstroemeria, Amaryllis, Anemone, Begonia, Calochortus, Canna, Crinum, Crocosmia, Dahlia, Dierama, Eucomis, Galtonia, Gladiolus, Gloriosa, Haemanthus, Hymenocallis, Lilium, Oxalis, Pancratium, Paradisea, Polianthes, Sprekelia, Tritonia, Watsonia, Zantedeschia. * Autumn (fall) flowering bulbs: Crocus, Colchicum, Cyclamen, Nerine, Sternbergia. * Winter flowering bulbs: some species from the following genera: Galanthus, Crocus, Cyclamen and Eranthis. Some species of bulbous plants grow naturally in shady or woodland areas, and thus are well suited to areas in a garden that have similar conditions. Some species for shade are Allium ursinum, Anemone blanda, Anemone nemorosa, Arum italicum, Convallaria majalis, Corydalis flexuosa, Cyclamen purpurascens, Disporum flavescens, Erythronium, Fritillaria pallidiflora, Galanthus, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Iris douglasiana, Leucojum vernum, Lilium martagon, Ranunculus ficaria, Sanguinaria canadensis, Smilacina racemosa, Trillium and Uvularia grandiflora. = Naturalization = In large parks it is possible to plant some species so that they multiply spontaneously and grow amongst the grass or under trees. This practice, the naturalization of a species, is widely used in northern Europe and requires that the species' ecological requirements be satisfied. The most obvious advantage of this cultivation method is that it minimizes the attention the plants require once they have been naturalized. The plants that are suitable for naturalization are those that are sufficiently small but able to compete with the surrounding grass, they must be robust and able to withstand year after year of inclement weather and they must be prolific in order to spread rapidly. Naturalized crocuses in Victoria Park, London Some of the bulbs that are suitable for naturalization in parks include: Allium, Anemone, Arum, Colchicum, Crocus, Cyclamen, Endymion, Fritillaria, Galanthus, Ipheion, Leucojum, Lilium, Muscari, Narcissus, Ornithogalum, Scilla, Sternbergia and Tulipa. = Rock gardens = A rock garden is a garden that uses a combination of rocks and small plants. The plants are often chosen for their suitability to rocky terrain. Some of the bulb genera that are most suitable for rock gardens include: Allium, Anemone, Anthericum, Bulbocodium, Chionodoxa, Cyclamen, Eranthis, Erythronium, Galanthus, Ipheion, Muscari, Ornithogalum, Oxalis, Romulea, Rhodohypoxis and Scilla.  Multiplication  Bulbs can reproduce sexually, through seeds, or even vegetatively. Reproduction through seeds is generally used to rapidly increase the number of individuals of a given species and to improve genetic diversity. Many of the bulb species are self-incompatible, so pollination can only occur between clones of different plants in order to obtain seeds. The majority of seeds from bulbous plants germinate well if they are sown as soon as they reach maturity. Some species need a cold period in order to germinate. The biggest problem in reproducing through seeds is that the resulting plants have a greater variability in a wide range of characteristics, such as flower colour and height and flowering period. This means that asexual or vegetative reproduction is normally used commercially to propagate this type of plant. This means that the characteristics of a determined cultivar remain unaltered. Bulbs can reproduce vegetatively in a number of ways depending of the type of storage organ the plant has.  Commercial production  Commercial tulip field in Hillegom, the Netherlands Bulbs can be evergreen, such as Clivia, Agapanthus and some species and varieties of Iris and Hemerocallis. However, the majority are deciduous, dying down to the storage organ for part of the year. This characteristic has been taken advantage of in the commercialization of these plants. At the beginning of the rest period the bulbs can be dug out of the ground and prepared for sale as if they remain dry they do not need any nutrition for weeks or months. Bulbous plants are produced on an industrial scale for two main markets, cut flowers and dried bulbs. The bulbs are produced to satisfy the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens and as house plants, in addition to providing the bulbs necessary for the production of cut flowers. The international trade in cut flowers has a worldwide value of approximately 11,000 million Euros, which gives an idea of the economic importance of this activity. The Netherlands has been the leader in commercial production since the start of the 16th Century, both for the dried bulb market and for cut flowers. In fact, with approximately 30,000 hectares dedicated to this activity the production of bulbs in the Netherlands represents 65% of global production. The Netherlands also produces 95% of the international market in bulbs dedicated to the production of cut flowers. The United States is the second largest producer followed by France, Japan, Italy, United Kingdom, Israel, Brazil and Spain.

The creek becomes substantially wider as it runs past Riverglade Reserve and a residential estate at Huntleys Cove. It then runs under the Tarban Creek Bridge and flows on to the Parramatta River at Huntleys Point. A small footbridge also spans the creek, linking Riverglade Reserve to Joly Parade in Hunters Hill. History A well-known Gladesville identity of the 1920s was simply known as Black Lucy. She was Lucy Willerri, an Aboriginal woman, originally from Alligator River in Queensland, and she was aged somewhere between 70 and 100. Along with her dogs, she made her home in a humpy of scrap iron and wood in the lantana and blackberry bushes on the banks of Tarban Creek. When her hut burnt down in 1923, the citizens of Gladesville were so concerned they organised and built a new cottage for her in Auburn Street. More than 200 people attended the ceremonial handing over of keys by the Mayor of Hunters Hill.

Butler Professor of English and Chair of the Department at the University at Buffalo in New York. She received her PhD in 1980 from the University of Chicago, and was for many years the W.M. Keck Distinguished Service Professor at Pomona College. Since 2006 she has taught at the University at Buffalo, where she is Edward H. Butler Professor of English and SUNY Distinguished Professor. She has served editor of the Emily Dickinson Journal for a decade and as President of the Emily Dickinson International Society. Miller established her reputation as a foremost scholar of Emily Dickinson with the publication in 1987 of Emily Dickinson: A Poet's Grammar. Martha Nell Smith reviewed the book enthusiastically, calling Miller an \\"exciting reader\\" of Dickinson with \\"close and thoughtful interpretation\\" and a view of the poems as \\"communicative, not solipsistic acts.\\" David Porter praised Miller for showing \\"readers what is actually at stake in this idiosyncratic verse and maps better than anyone to date the links between the grammatical choices and literary identity.\\" Tom Paulin's review in the London Review of Books concluded that Cristanne Miller's \\"densely researched study\\" offered a \\"living and contemporary\\" reading of Dickinson's poems. \\"Miller works from the assumption that Dickinson sees herself 'oppositionally, defining her position in the world negatively, by distance from some social construct or law'. And Miller shows how those negations have a constructive role.\\" Other reviewers were similarly enthusiastic. She has been fellow at the Free University of Berlin, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the University of Oxford. She currently edits The Emily Dickinson Journal (2005-). Miller has published equally extensively on Marianne Moore and modernist poetry, including essays or books on Moore, Mina Loy, Else Lasker-Schuler, Elizabeth Bishop, modernism in New York and Berlin, and gender and modernism. Emma Neale in the London Quarterly calls her 1996 Marianne Moore: Questions of Authority \\"An elegant tribute to a complex style...Gender, race, class and power are subjects which are used [by Miller] convincingly to unearth embedded references to several aspects of social control in the poetry itself.\\"Emma Neale, London Quarterly. Celeste Goodridge in American Literature remarks that \\"the revisionary thrust of this book is important, timely, and a major contribution to Moore studies and the history of modernism.\\"Celeste Goodridge American Literature Vol. 68, No. 2 (Jun., 1996), pp. 487-488. On Miller's more recent Cultures of Modernism, Janet Lyon writes in Modernism/modernity that it \\"offers a welcome corrective to the unreflective critical tendency . . . to make broad claims about the historical experiences and cultural conundrums of 'women,' and particularly 'women writers.' Miller offers tour-de-force comparative readings . . . threading together the world-historical with the personal, poetics with the political, and wielding the instruments of scansion as deftly as a surgeon.\\"Janet Lyon, Modernism/Modernity, Volume 13, Number 3, September 2006, pp. 586-588. Miller was President of the Modernist Studies Association in 2006-07. Other topics on which Miller has published include poetry and theory, American Civil War poetry, women and language, feminism and poetry, and Walt Whitman.

The species is known from fragmentary remains found at the Murgon fossil site, in south-eastern Queensland, dating to the early Eocene, 54.6 million years ago. It is the oldest bat from the Southern Hemisphere and one of the oldest bats in the world, and inhabited forests and swampy areas, with a diet of insects and possibly small fish.  Taxonomy  A monotypic genus allied to the family Archaeonycteridae, or classified by an indeterminate familial arrangement, describing fossil material collected at Murgon in 1994. The type specimen is a tooth. The material was discovered at the Tingamarra Local Fauna – Boat Mountain deposit, the type and only known location of fossil evidence of the species. The phylogenetic relationship to other Chiroptera is uncertain, but may represent an early geographic dispersal and separation from the crown clade of bat taxa found on other continents. The genus name is derived from ancient Greek, indicating a bat with an Australian distribution. The specific epithet honours Elaine Clark, a person closely associated with the palaeontological research at Riversleigh and Murgon. Description  Australonycteris clarkae, one of the earliest bats in the fossil record, is known from several upper and lower teeth, an edentulous lower-jaw fragment, a partial periotic bone, and several postcranial fragments. It has a forearm length of , making it a medium-size bat species, and it could echolocate. Australonycteris displayed some differences in dental anatomy, compared to extant bats. Unlike other purported Eocene bats, such as the Wyonycteris species of Wyoming and Europe in the northern hemisphere, Australonycteris clarkae possessed many of the anatomical characteristics of the modern microchiropteran. The tooth tip of A. clarkae shows wear consistent with carrying prey with a hard carapace, such as beetles, or bony skeleton of fish; the body size of the species would make predation of fish at least possible. Australonycteris is thought to have been fully capable of flight.

It was built in 2009, and officially opened on 12 April 2009. Fukuoka Mosque aims to serve about 1,000 Muslims in Fukuoka Prefecture, as well to serve people in Japan interested in Islam. It arranges daily prayers, Friday prayers, Eid prayers on regular basis. It occasionally, arranges program for conversion into Islam, Muslim marriage, and funeral prayers. Fukuoka Masjid is open for any non-Muslims as well. Non-Muslims can enter the mosque to watch prayers, discuss with others various Islamic and cultural issues, and collect introductory booklets on Islam. They are also allowed to attend Muslim prayers, if they wish. The cultural wing of the mosque offers weekend Arabic language lessons for kids, women and men, cooking classes once every three months. It also arranges seminars and dialogue sessions occasionally. Kyushu University Muslim Student Association (KUMSA) initiated the idea of building a mosque in 1998, and started collecting donations. In 2006, land was purchased, and construction plan was started. After a series of discussions with neighbors, the construction was started in 2008, and it took almost one year to finish. The first floor is mainly set for the men's prayer room, the second floor is the women's prayer room. On the basement level, there is a multi- purpose hall, a library, and a kitchen. The third floor has classrooms and a kitchen. It is located in Hakozaki, Higashi-ku in the city of Fukuoka, just a one-minute walk from the west exit of JR Hakozaki Station.

Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.Curry, Edward. 2012. “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.” In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106. Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking energy consumption to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote energy conservation. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display. Data collection Energy Management Software collects historic and/or real-time interval data, with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute smart meter readings. The data are collected from interval meters, Building Automation Systems (BAS), directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits, or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption. Data analytics Through Energy Data Analytics, EMS assists the users in the composition of mathematical formulas for analyzing, forecasting and tracking energy conservation measures to quantify the success of the measure, once implemented. Energy analytics help energy managers combine across energy and non-energy data to create key performance indicators, calculate carbon footprint, greenhouse gas, renewable heat incentives and energy efficiency certifications to meet local climate change policies, directives, regulation and certifications. Energy analytics also include intelligent algorithms such as classification and machine learning to analyse the energy consumption of buildings and/or its equipment that build up a memory of energy use patterns, learn the good and bad energy consumption behaviours and notify in case of abnormal energy use. Reporting Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather condition or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures. Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs. Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect GHG emissions, which may be used for internal reporting or enterprise carbon accounting. Monitoring Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modelling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities. Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives. EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS. Engagement Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention. Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real- time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives. People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.\\"The Prius Effect\\" by Elizabeth Dickinson See also *Energy & Facility Management Software *Building automation *Energy monitoring and targeting *Energy saving *Google PowerMeter *EnergyCAP *RETScreen *Energy Management System ReferencesExternal links * U.S. Dept of Energy's Building Technologies Program Category:Energy Category:Energy conservation Category:Management systems Category:Building automation Category:Business software Category:Low-energy building Category:Sustainable building ","title":"Energy management software"},{"id":"22807623","text":"A view of Exchange Place with the New Orleans Central Business District in the background Exchange Place, formally Exchange Passage, is a pedestrian zone in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.

The storm originated from an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August 26\\\\. The following day, the low became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression, while tracking general westward. By August 29, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Luis by the National Hurricane Center. Luis attained hurricane status the following day as an eye began to develop. On September 1 the cyclone intensified into a major hurricane—a storm with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher—and further strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane later that day. Hurricane Luis maintained wind speeds of 130 mph (215 km/h) for nearly two days and developed a symmetrical structure with a well-defined 46 mi (74 km) wide eye. Early on September 3, winds within the eyewall reached 150 mph (240 km/h). Luis weakened slightly maintained this intensity until September 5, shortly before passing through the Leeward Islands with 130 mph (215 km/h) winds. The hurricane maintained Category 4 status until September 7 as it tracked towards the northwest. Gradual weakening took place for several days and by September 9, the hurricane passed about 200 mi (320 km) west of Bermuda. The next day, Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition and the storm's forward motion rapidly increased. Early on September 11, Luis made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula as a strong Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (140 km/h). The same day, a wave produced by Luis struck an ocean liner. This wave is the largest ever recorded, Several hours later, the storm completed its extratropical transition as it began to be absorbed into an approaching trough. The following day, the remnants of Luis were fully absorbed into the trough near the southern coast of Greenland. Formation and intensification left On August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave between the western coast of Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. Later that day, a low-level circulation center formed beneath the wave and began strengthening. Convective activity associated with the low became increasingly organized, and at around 1200 UTC on August 27, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen; at the time, it was located approximately 255 miles (410 kilometres) south-southeast of Praia, Cape Verde. Operationally, the NHC did not begin to issue advisories on the depression until 2100 UTC on August 28. Tracking nearly due west in response to an anticyclone to the north and an area of moderate wind shear, the depression was forecast to slowly strengthen over the next several days. Early on August 29, satellite intensity estimates of maximum sustained winds within the depression reached 40 mph (65 km/h), indicating that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the NHC assigned the name Luis to the system. Gradual strengthening took place throughout August 29 as Luis tracked towards the west-northwest. Increased wind shear displaced convection from the center of circulation, preventing further intensification. By August 30, strong outflow developed around Luis despite convection remaining displaced from the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800 UTC that day, Luis attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900 UTC on August 31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around the periphery of the cyclone. By the morning of August 31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100 mph (155 km/h), making Luis a low-end Category 2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category 3 hurricane in 36 hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen. Peak intensity and the Leeward Islands Hurricane Luis on September 3 with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) Early on September 1, Hurricane Luis strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h); upper-level outflow continued to improve throughout the day, allowing further intensification. Maintaining its structure, Luis further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h). Subsequent to doing so, its intensity remained steady for 42 hours while it tracked nearly due west. Early on September 3, satellite intensity estimates indicated that the storm strengthened slightly, attaining its peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) at around 0600 UTC. Continuing on a westward track, the forward motion of the hurricane decreased to 13 mph (20 km/h) later on September 3. When Luis was about 690 mi (1,110 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight into the storm confirmed satellite intensity estimates. Flight level winds around the eye of Luis were recorded at 165 mph (270 km/h), which corresponds to surface winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 944 mbar (27.87 inHg). Hurricane Luis on September 6 to the north of the Leeward Islands With a Category 4 hurricane forecast to track directly over the Leeward Islands, hurricane warnings were issued for several islands by September 4\\\\. The ridge located north of Luis began to weaken by this time, leading to slower forward movement to 12 mph (19 km/h). Outflow to the north of the hurricane weakened slightly as a distinct area of dry air developed around the weakening ridge. Late on September 4, the hurricane's eye began to shrink, a possible indication of strengthening. An area of low pressure over Florida cut off from a trough would eventually cause Luis to slow significantly and cause a northward turn. On September 5, Hurricane Luis weakened slightly, with winds decreasing to 135 mph (215 km/h), before tracking directly over Barbuda. The eyewall of the storm brushed Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Sustained winds on these islands were recorded up to 80 mph (130 km/h) with gusts up to 155 mph (250 km/h). The eye of Luis was estimated to be 46 mi (74 km) in diameter at this time. Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Luis to a Category 3 hurricane as it passed through the islands due to the formation of concentric eyewalls; however, in post-season analysis, it was determined that the storm never weakened below Category 4 status while passing through the Leeward Islands. Bermuda and dissipation Tracking away from the Leeward Islands on September 6, Luis maintained Category 4 status for another 24 hours before downgrading to a Category 3 hurricane. A strong mid- to upper-level low located over the Gulf of Mexico was forecast to steer the hurricane in a general northeastern direction. From September 6 to 7, a ship named the Teal Arrow sailed directly into the center, encountering wind gusts of up to 145 mph (235 km/h) and seas to . The storm's eye further shrank to a diameter of 23 mi (37 km). The NHC anticipated re-strengthening as the central pressure decreased. The winds failed to intensity; however, the central pressure continued to decrease until 0000 UTC on September 8, when it fell to 935 mbar (27.61 inHg), the lowest recorded during the storm's existence. Tracking around the periphery of the ridge of high pressure, Luis began to slow. Late on September 7, a double eye featured developed, indicating an eyewall replacement cycle, with the strongest winds being recorded in the outer eyewall. By the afternoon of September 8, the eye became cloud filled, indicating weakening; however, the inner eyewall dissipated later that day, leaving a large, 52 mi (84 km) wide eye in its place. Tracking towards the north-northwest, Luis was forecast to move over an area of cooler waters upwelled by Hurricane Felix. Hurricane Luis making landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 Early on September 9, Luis turned towards the north and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 110 mph (165 km/h). Several hours later, the hurricane made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 200 mi (320 km) west of the island. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis. During the afternoon of September 10, Hurricane Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at an unusually high latitude. During the afternoon of September 10, the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961 mbar (28.38 inHg) but sustained winds did not exceed 90 mph (140 km/h) according to the NHC. Luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland early on September 11. While tracking over Newfoundland, cold, dry air became entrenched in Luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900 UTC on September 11 as it tracked nearly 65 mph (100 km/h) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants persisted for 30 more hours over the North Atlantic Ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September 12. Records When Tropical Depression Thirteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Luis on August 29, it marked the second earliest date on which the twelfth named storm of any season formed, before being surpassed by Hurricane Laura which formed on August 21, 2020. Shortly before becoming extratropical, Hurricane Luis was moving at 65 mph (105 km/h), becoming among the fastest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. On September 11, a wave struck an ocean liner. This wave is the largest ever recorded, though Hurricane Ivan in 2004 may have produced a wave up to high off the coast of Mexico.

It was an experiment (hence 'EX') to see what a supercar based on the Toyota 7 (hence '-7') racing car would be like. The mid mounted engine was similar to the Toyota 7 engine except that EX-7 did not have turbochargers. The Toyota 7 had but the EX-7 was detuned down to for road use. Transmission was by a manual gearbox as part of a transaxle. Double wishbone independent suspension was on all 4 wheels and vented disc brakes were used on both the front and rear. The body shape was similar to that of other supercars of the time, like the Mercedes C111, with a long flat nose blended into a long windscreen and a high rear with a vertical cutoff. The doors were shaped like a typical gull-wing door but unusually the hinge was at the rear of the roof section of the door and each door opened to the rear. Electronics Car A modified Corona was shown at the 1970 Tokyo Motor Show as the Electronics Car. Based on the Corona Hardtop 1700SL, it was a cutaway model showing EFI, Electric Skid Control, Electronic Automatic Transmission, air bags, monitor display and cruise control. It was not put into production but many of its components did eventually reach production in various Toyota models. SV–1 Shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in October–November 1971, the SV-1 was the prototype for the Celica liftback released in April 1973. The prototype was built on a TA22 GT chassis with frame number TA22-026004. This was originally built in May 1971 as a Celica TA22 GT coupe. The mechanicals of the TA22 GT were retained (1600cc 2T-G twincam engine). The front of the interior was the same as the TA22 GT except for a different fabric pattern on the seats. Electric window lifts were used (optional but rare on the TA22 GT) but the TA22 GT's optional air conditioning was not present. The rear 2 seats were individually reclining using the same reclining hinges and latches as the front seats except that the rear latches were in the middle. A centre padded vinyl console was between the 2 rear seats and the seat belts clipped into it when not in use. The spare tyre sat vertically at the very rear of the cargo area under a vinyl cover. The SV-1 had a rear fuel filler similar to the early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side fuel fillers in mid 1972, so from the RA28 all production liftbacks had fuel fillers on the left rear quarter panel with a cover flap. The RA25 and TA27 were the first production liftbacks and their fuel fillers were in the centre rear of the vehicle, behind a pulled down panel. The SV-1 rear hatch glass was a bit larger than the production version. The key hole for the hatch was on the beaver panel (it was on the hatch on production liftbacks). The grill was an ST type – just like all 1973–1975 production liftbacks (even the GT models). Dual exhaust tips exited out the rear (production Celicas had a single exhaust tip). An electric aerial was put in the left rear quarter (the TA22 had this on the left front wheel guard). The RV-1 (a prototype 2 door wagon based on the Celica coupe) with the Marinetta boat and trailer was also shown at the 1971 Tokyo Motor show but did not reach production. Marinetta The Marinetta was a concept trailer made by Toyota and shown during the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show behind the RV-1 concept car. The bottom half was a conventional single axle small trailer made from fibreglass. For the exhibit, it was shown with one inflatable tent next to it and another tent packed inside. The top half of the trailer was a small boat mounted upside-down, with the bottom half of the trailer matching the boat shape along their joining edges. The boat used an outboard motor that could be disconnected and stowed in the bottom half when the halves were reassembled for towing. The exterior was painted white with a black stripe and the interior was painted bright orange. A jet ski and its trailer were also shown alongside the Marinetta at the show stand. RV–1 The RV-1 was a 2-door wagon concept car based on the Celica and shown during the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show. The front had vertical corners instead of the normal Celica's sloping park lights (indicator lights in some markets). The bonnet was also extended forward to match. An unusual grill was used featuring large round holes instead of the more common slats or hexagonal holes. The front windows and the doors remained the same as the Celica but the roof line was extended to cover the rear passenger seats and then continued as a thin spine to the rear of the car. On each side of the spine a centre hinged gull wing window completed the roof and continued down to the waistline. A large integral roll bar completed the rear and also held up the rear of the roof spine. The tail lights and rear indicators shown through many small round holes in the rear face of the bodywork. Unusually for Celicas, the rear bumper had cut-outs to house red reflectors and reversing lights. A 1 metre wide tail gate with a frameless wind-down window occupied the centre of the rear. The centre section of the bumper moved with the tail gate instead of being fixed directly to the body. A tow bar was fitted so that it could be shown with the Marinetta. The RV-1 was designed a part of a recreational vehicle system that included the RV-1 car, the Marinetta trailer (which included a fibreglass dinghy), a 5-person inflatable tent and a jet ski on its own trailer. The SV-1 Celica liftback prototype was also shown at the same time at the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show. The RV-1 never went into production but the SV-1 did. RV–2 The RV-2 was a 2-door wagon concept car shown during the October 1972 Tokyo Motor Show. and the April 1973 New York International Auto Show. Styling was up-to-date with sharply formed edges and large rectangular headlights. The front bumper covered only the corners, allowing the grill to be much more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged clam shell doors covering the entire rear section. An integrated roll bar terminated the body work and also formed a place for the clam shell doors to seal. The clam shell doors met each in the middle of the roof with no centre support. When the doors were raised you could stretch a tent between them. Two adults could sleep in the tent section and another two adults could sleep on the front seats, which could fold down flat. Finally, the rear section included a full width tail gate with a wind- down window nestled under the rear roll bar. Larger than the 1971 RV-1, some sources say the RV-2 was based on the Mark II while others say it was based on the Crown. Both the Mark II and the Crown shared major mechanical parts with the RV-2 (4M engine, transmission, suspension), so either could be true. The RV-2 uses wheels with 5 studs, just like the Crown and unlike the 4 stud Mark II wheels but these parts are easy to swap between the cars. The 2600 cc 4M engine was uprated to include SU carburettors to give 190 km/h. A fully working prototype in RHD was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show and reviewed in the August 1973 issue of Penthouse magazine. Toyota also printed a large number of a brochure for the USA market in order to gauge the market reaction. It was generally well received but apparently not enough to put it into production. The brochure included sketches with the steering wheel clearly shown on the left hand side but the photographs of the real vehicle hid the steering wheel – which was on the right hand side. ESV–2 The ESV was a 2-door, 2-seater concept car built to conform to the Japanese government's Experimental Safety Vehicle specifications and shown during the 1972 Tokyo Motor Show. Weight had to be under and prevent serious injury in a crash with a vehicle at . In order to provide adequate crumple zones while remaining within the size given by the government specifications, Toyota was forced to make the car a 2-seater. The vehicle at the show was the second ESV made. Unique alloy wheels were used. ESV The ESV was a 2-door, 2-seater concept car built to conform to the Japanese government's Experimental Safety Vehicle specifications and shown during the 1973 Tokyo Motor Show. The ESV was the 100th and final vehicle produced by Toyota under the ESV program. It was mostly similar to the ESV-2 except the ESV had larger, plastic bumpers and slight differences in the trim. Safety features included 4-wheel anti-skid brakes, 4-beam headlights, air bags, silicone rubber front bumper mounted on internal shock absorbers and crumple zones. The front suspension used double wishbones. Marinetta 10 The Marinetta 10 was a concept trailer made by Toyota and shown during the 1973 Tokyo Motor Show behind a Corona hardtop in a beach setting, complete with beach sand and palm trees. The 1973 versions was very similar to the 1971 Marinetta. The fibreglass exteriors were unchanged but the bottom half was changed internally to be similar to a pop-up caravan. Once the boat half was removed, beds could be folded out to the left and right sides and a fold-out frame raised complete with a fabric covering. With the total trailer weighing , hydraulic brakes were used powered by the trailers own inertia when the tow car decelerates. The exterior was painted white with an orange stripe along the top of the boat and 'Marinetta 10' in white lettering inside the stripe (which would be upside-down and underwater when the boat is in use) Century Gas Turbine Hybrid The Century Gas Turbine Hybrid was a Toyota Century with a GT45 gas turbine and electric motor, shown as a concept vehicle at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show. A GT45 gas turbine engine was mounted in a Toyota Century, one of the few Toyotas with an engine bay big enough. The engine was connected to an electrical generator connected to 20 batteries of 12 V each, which then drove two electric motors, one motor for the front left wheel and the second motor for the right front wheel. Using kerosene, could be reached and could be reached using the batteries alone. The Century was first trialled in this manner in 1971 but not shown to the public until 1975. A similar system was trialled from 1971 on some Toyota buses. Another version of the engine was shown at the 1977 Tokyo Motor Show (GT24), at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show (in the Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid) and another at the 1985 Tokyo Motor Show (Gas Turbine II in the Toyota GTV).Toyota brochure from the 1985 Tokyo Motor Show (Japanese) MP–1 The Toyota MP–1 (Multi–Purpose wagon) was a concept vehicle for a multi–purpose vehicle produced by Toyota and first shown at the 1975 Tokyo Motor Show. This van was unusual in being based on the Crown passenger car chassis instead of a commercial vehicle chassis. Tomica made a limited edition scale model of the MP–1. Externally, the MP–1 resembles a van with a sharply sloped bonnet. The two front doors are normal hinged doors but the rear–most of the side doors slide backwards along rails. The entire rear of the MP–1 is a top hinged rear door. The passenger side sliding door also incorporated a lifting step to allow wheelchair access. Internally, the front passenger can turn 360 degrees and the rear bench seat can be tipped 90 degrees to face forwards or backwards. A sunroof and refrigerator were included. The MP–1 was meant to be FWD but time pressures forced Toyota to re–use the six–cylinder engine and RWD drive train from the Crown. CAL–1 Shown at the 1977 Tokyo Motor Show (Oct–Nov) and the 1978 Chicago Auto Show., the CAL-1 was based on the prototype Supra. The CAL-1, Supra and the new generation of Celica were all designed at Calty, Toyota's California design studio. Even though the CAL-1 was designed in California, it was right hand drive and had Japanese front mounted mirrors. The rear decking opened into a pair of rear seats and the rear window opened into a wind deflector for the rear passengers. Further portions of the rear decking could be removed to make it into a pickup. Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid The Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid was a concept vehicle based on the Toyota Sports 800, fitted with a gas turbine engine and first shown at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show. The gas turbine engine was connected to a generator, which fed an electric motor connected to a 2 speed gearbox. This vehicle was shown again in the nostalgia section of the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. Minor changes had been made to it: the red roof had been changed to black, the black side mirrors had been changed to red, a large bonnet scoop had been added and the plain steel wheels had been replaced with alloy wheels. For unknown reasons, the placard next to the vehicle said that the vehicle had originally been shown at the 1977 Tokyo Motor Show instead of the 1979 show. CX–80, FCX–80 The CX-80 (also known as the FCX-80) was a concept vehicle built by Toyota and shown at the October 1979 Tokyo Motor Show. It was designed to be an experimental city car for the future that would save fuel by being light and compact. The bonnet sloped sharply, with a pod in the middle for the headlights. Front wheel drive was used, leaving the cabin floor flat and the cabin spacious. The side windows were mounted high on the waistline but this was offset by having transparent cut-outs in the body's side panels. Family Wagon The Family Wagon was a concept vehicle built by Toyota based on the Liteace and shown at the October 1979 Tokyo Motor Show. It had three rows of seats, with the two seats in the second row able to swivel 180 degrees or to fold flat to form a continuous surface with one of the two seats in the third row. A small table was placed between the rightmost seats of the second and third rows. A rear-facing television was mounted in the roof just behind the front row of seats.

The Harbor of Refuge is at the mouth of the Delaware Bay estuary where it opens into the Atlantic Ocean, at Lewes. The district is almost entirely offshore, touching land only at the former United States Coast Guard station. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Delaware Breakwater An 1822 study authorized by the United States Congress investigated the possibility of a haven at Cape Henlopen. Led by General Simon Bernard, Major Joseph Gilbert Totten and Commodore William Bainbridge, the committee recommended that a permanent harbor be created. In 1826, William Strickland began to design the breakwater, which would be the first of its kind in the Western hemisphere and the third in the world, after one in Cherbourg, France, and the Plymouth Breakwater at Plymouth, England. Work began in 1828 on what is now the inner breakwater, listed in its own right on the National Register as the Delaware Breakwater. These works consisted of a main breakwater and a icebreaker pier. Both were built of granite rubble from New Castle County, Delaware, with earlier portions using smaller stones from the Hudson Palisades. The breakwaters are wide at the base and at the top. The project used 835,000 tons of stone. Strickland also designed a lighthouse for the harbor, which was completed the next year. The harbor was a success, but it soon became apparent that it was too small. During storms as many as 200 ships would seek refuge. Shoaling was also a problem. In 1877, a hurricane destroyed several ships in the harbor, and others that could not get into the harbor. To improve things, work began in 1883 to close the opening between the icebreaker and main breakwater, using the same stone as the original. This project rendered obsolete the Strickland lighthouse, which was replaced in 1885 by the present Delaware Breakwater East End Light. The work dragged on for 16 years, during which 70 sailors perished in the Great Blizzard of 1888.The breakwater closure was finally completed in 1898. An iron pier was built beginning in 1871 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and completed in 1882. The pier was designed to carry rail traffic directly out to ships in the harbor. The structure used iron screw piles with wood decking. The pier was later adapted for use by the U.S. Lifesaving Station and the quarantine station. The iron pier shafts remain visible in the harbor, a hazard to navigation. National Harbor of Refuge Outer harbor Inner harbor In 1896 Congress authorized a new, larger program of breakwaters, the National Harbor of Refuge. Located to the north of the original breakwater on a shoal known as The Shears, the new breakwater used much larger stone. The dressed and fitted masonry used individual pieces of up to 13 tons. The new breakwater was long at low water and wide. Ten icebreaker piers were built to the north of dressed stone in a line. Compared with the earlier effort, steam- powered equipment allowed the use of larger stones and sped construction. The project cost $2,090,765.82 and was completed in 1901. The first Harbor of Refuge Light was built on this breakwater and began operation in 1908. Damaged in 1920 by storms, it was replaced by the current structure in 1926. This light effectively replaced the 1767 Cape Henlopen Light, which was abandoned in 1924 and fell into the sea in 1926. Coast Guard Station The Lewes Coast Guard Station now functions as the Delaware River pilot's station. The station is a 2.5-story balloon-framed building, built in 1938 in Colonial Revival style. The principal facade faces the harbor with an enclosed porch supported by paired Tuscan columns. Shingle siding covers the station. An enclosed observation platform on the roof has a Chinese Chippendale railing, with adapted Palladian windows on all sides.

In the United States, 45 of the 50 states have an office of lieutenant governor. In two of the 45 states, the speaker of the upper house of the state legislature serves in such a capacity. In most cases, the lieutenant governor is the highest officer of state after the governor, standing in for that officer when they are absent from the state or temporarily incapacitated. In the event a governor dies, resigns or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor typically becomes governor. In 26 states, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket, ensuring that they come from the same political party. In the remaining 18 states, they are elected separately and, thus, may come from different parties. The lieutenant governor is also frequently the presiding officer of the upper house of the state legislature, similar to the Vice President of the United States. Among the seven states without a separate, full-time office of lieutenant governor, two states have a post of lieutenant governor that is filled by the highest officer of the State Senate. In Tennessee, the full title of the leader of the Senate is \\"lieutenant governor and speaker of the Senate\\". In West Virginia, the title of lieutenant governor is assigned by statute to the Senate President. With the exception of Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia, every state has had a female lieutenant governor or equivalent. In Maine, the presiding officer of the State Senate assumes the governor's office upon a vacancy, while in New Hampshire, the presiding officer of the State Senate assumes only the governor's powers and duties (becomes acting governor) upon a vacancy. In the remaining three states – Arizona, Oregon and Wyoming – the Secretary of State becomes governor upon the office's vacancy. The U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands have the office of lieutenant governor. In Puerto Rico, the appointed Secretary of State becomes governor upon the office's vacancy while the Chief of Staff is typically the highest office after the governor. Lieutenant governors are the only officials with specific duties and powers in two branches of state government: the executive and legislative branches. More than half of the NLGA members preside over their state senate. Most pursue legislative initiatives; many testify locally and in Washington D.C. in various capacities; some serve on the governors’ cabinets, while others maintain varied portfolios of duties. In many states, the duties of lieutenant governor are increased by legislation to include the lieutenant governor on state boards, commissions and task forces.\\" Since Alaska, Hawaii and Utah do not have a Secretary of State, the lieutenant governor performs the duties generally granted to that office. In New Jersey, the governor must appoint the lieutenant governor to head a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the state government's executive branch—but not to the post of state attorney general,New Jersey State Constitution (1947), Article V, Section I, paragraph 10 (as amended, effective January 17, 2006) Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno also served as Secretary of State from 2010 to 2018. The Lieutenant Governor of Texas plays an active role as presiding officer of the State Senate and is often rumored to be more powerful than the state governor.Texas Observer: Who Runs Texas The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia also serves as the President of the Senate, as do about half the lieutenant governors. The positions are sometimes criticized for lacking duties and power and described by political insiders as \\"get up, read the paper, see if the governor is dead, if not, go back to sleep\\". In the 2010 election for the Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island, 40% of the vote was won by Robert J. Healey, a perennial candidate who wanted to abolish the office, saying \\"If you open up the dictionary to ‘sinecure,’ you have a picture of the Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island\\".  New Jersey  In November 2005, New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment to create the office of lieutenant governor, which became effective with the 2009 general election. The state's first lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, took office in January 2010. The position was created in response to the unusual circumstances surrounding the aftermath of the 2001 gubernatorial election. Senate President Donald DiFrancesco became acting governor earlier that year after Christine Todd Whitman resigned to take office as EPA Administrator. DiFrancesco's term as Senate president expired one week before governor-elect Jim McGreevey assumed office in January 2002, and the 2001 State Senate elections resulted in the balance of the New Jersey Senate being tied between the two parties. Due to the tie, Democrat Richard Codey and Republican John O. Bennett were elected as Senate Co-Presidents, and in the 90-minute period between the expiration of DiFrancesco's term and the swearing-in of Codey and Bennett, State Attorney General John Farmer Jr. served as acting governor due to the position of Senate President being vacant. Subsequently, Bennett and Codey served as governor for three days each until McGreevey took office. All told, five people had served as governor or acting governor in the space of eight days. States and territories without a lieutenant governor Arizona= In Arizona, the secretary of state is the first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. The line of succession also includes the attorney general, state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction.See: Arizona#State executive branch. =Maine= In Maine, if the governor cannot serve, the immediate successor is the Senate president.See: Governor of Maine#Succession. =New Hampshire= Whenever the governor dies, resigns, is removed from office or unable to perform the duties of office, the Senate president serves as \\"acting governor\\".See: New Hampshire#Branches of government. =Oregon= The gubernatorial line of succession is set forth in the state constitution, at Article V, Section 8a. It defines who may become or act as the governor of Oregon upon the incapacity, death, resignation, or removal from office (by impeachment and subsequent removal or recall) of a sitting governor. The current chain of succession is: secretary of State, State treasurer, president of the State Senate, speaker of the House of Representatives. When a governor leaves office, the next available elected individual in the succession becomes governor until the next general biennial election, when a governor will be elected to either serve out the last two years of a regular term or a new four-year term.https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state-constitution.aspx See: line of succession. In 2007, legislation was proposed to establish an office of lieutenant governor. =Wyoming= In Wyoming, the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession.See: Wyoming#State law and government. =Puerto Rico= The highest-ranking officer after the governor of Puerto Rico is the Chief of Staff who is appointed by the governor himself rather than elected. In terms of line of succession, the secretary of State of Puerto Rico acts as acting governor when the governor is temporarily disabled or unable to discharge his duties. If there is a permanent vacancy in the governorship, the Constitution of Puerto Rico establishes that the secretary becomes governor for the remainder of the term. The Secretary of State also serves as acting governor whenever the governor is temporarily not present in Puerto Rico, with territorial law also establishing a line of succession for when both the governor and the secretary are unable to perform their duties.

The general account may also be considered everything that is not represented by a separate accounts of the firm, if such separate account has been established by the company. Should a firm have no separate accounts, then its only account is the general account. The term should not be thought of narrowly in terms of a bank account or general ledger account, but rather the broader concept introduced in the first sentence. Policyholders of insurance policies (that are not associated with separate accounts) do not have a legal or other direct interest or right to the assets or investments of the insurance company's general account but rather these obligations for benefits or claims are general obligations of the company. In this case, policyholders are subject to credit risk of the insurance company-- that is, should the insurance company fail or go bankrupt, the claims or cash values of policies are not directly backed or collateralized by the company's investments and other assets. In the U.S., state insurance departments examine (audit) insurance companies to evaluate many things, principally to see if the company is sound and policyholder interests are protected. A.M.

It is next to the city's post office and across from the offices of the Poughkeepsie Journal, at the corner with Balding Avenue. It was built around 1890 by a local real estate attorney and has had many owners, and some other uses, since then. A prominent example of the Queen Anne architectural style in the city, it was left out of the neighboring historic district because the house was inconsistent with the Balding homes. Fifteen years later, in 1997, it was finally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in its own right, the only property in all of Dutchess County listed on the Register by its street address. Building 73 Mansion is a two-and-a-half-story frame house on a painted brick foundation sided in clapboard with decorative shingles and painted trim. It is topped by a hipped roof with the original slate, lower cross-gables and a pyramidal tower with weathervane, pierced by gabled dormer windows and a paneled and corbelled brick chimney. Its facades are characterized by overlapping planes and textures, consistent with Queen Anne Style houses. Bays project, one of which has a cutaway bay window, asymmetrically placed on the south (front) facade and both sides. The east gable end has an arched vergeboard. Yankee gutters run along the roofline. There are three entrances on the first floor, all with their own gable-roofed porch and patterned pediment. Two have curved, routed brackets as supports. The building's fenestration is similarly eclectic, including round and polygonal windows and colored-glass inserts next to angled muntins. Inside, the floor plan follows the asymmetry of the exterior trim. It has much of its original finish as well: herringbone-patterned oak panels below the front bay windows, plaster ceiling medallions and crown moldings in each room, light fixtures, staircase railing and narrow-strip oak flooring. Behind the house, on the property, is a modern garage added in the 1950s. It is not considered a contributing property to the listing. History Charles Cossum, a local real estate attorney, built the house sometime around 1890. His office was three blocks away on Market Street. He had been very successful, and the location of his home on the northern end of downtown Poughkeepsie, within walking distance of his work, is characteristic of the pre-automobile era, when houses close to a city center were the most desirable. His family owned the house until 1917, whereupon it went through a succession of many other owners until 1933, when a local pediatrician moved in and turned it into his home office. His family owned it for many years. In 1982, when the houses around the corner on Balding Avenue were designated as a historic district and added to the National Register, 73 Mansion Street was excluded because it was larger and more lavishly decorated than the more modest homes on Balding. In 1995 it was sold to its present owner, who renovated and restored it with the help of federal tax credits. Two years later, in 1997, it was added to the National Register in its own right.

GAC built three types of aircraft during the First World War and operated a flying school. The aircraft were the Verville Flying Boat, the Gamma S biplane with floats (floatplane), and the Gamma L biplane with wheels. All had engine installations driving pusher propellers.The Havre Daily News, August 26th, 1928, Page 3 Founding The key player in the company was 18-year-old Corwin Van Husen, who was supported by his guardian W. Howie Muir and other key players of Detroit and Grosse Pointe society. Other major investors included Fred and Russell Alger (who were also investors in the Wright Company and had demonstrated the Wright craft at the Grosse Pointe Country Club four years earlier), Herbert B. and Frank P. Book, Wm. Hendrie, and Jerome H. Remick. In November 1915, the GAC hired 24-year-old Alfred V. Verville, an experienced airplane designer who would be a part of Detroit's aviation activities for years to come. Design of the company's first airplane, a two-passenger biplane flying boat, was completed in December and construction of the hull was begun by the Mayea Boat & Aeroplane Works. The flying boat was flight tested during early 1916 and was advertised nationally for sale beginning in September. The U.S. Navy purchased the plane as a trainer, the first built-in-Detroit airplane sold for profit.Mondey, David (2000) The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft. London: Quantum. p.265 With U.S. involvement in World War One imminent, Verville began designing a military airplane, the Gamma. By November 1916, the prototype, a \\"pusher\\" type plane with the engine and propeller behind the crew, was fitted with seaplane floats and test flown from its base on the Detroit River. In the meantime, the leading industry magazine Aviation gave the GAC plane a boost by running a two-page story about the as yet unproved craft.Company History, 2009 Mayea Boat & Aeroplane Works - Division of D&L; Marine Consulting, Book with Verville included For the winter the Gamma was fitted with wheels to replace the floats.

Career At just 18, one year out of Dannevirke High School, Furlong played for Hawke's Bay in their midweek match against the touring 1963 England side. It was an immensely strong Bay side at the time and the game against England was comfortably won. In the next three seasons Furlong, 1.83m and nearly 90 kg, briefly played for Wellington B in 1966 and Bay of Plenty early in 1967 Furlong midway through the 1967 season began what was the most effective period of his rugby career. This was as the first five in the Bay's golden Ranfurly Shield era which lasted until 1969. Furlong became one of the Bay's mainstays in retaining the shield when Wellington strongly challenged at the end of the 1967 season. Furlong, who in 1963 had missed a late dropped goal against Auckland which would have meant an historic win, this time dropped the goal which gave the Bay a 12-all draw. Furlong is of Ngati Porou and Ngai Tahu descent. This plus his solid form for the Bay in 1967–69 made him a contender for the All Black side to tour South Africa in 1970. Furlong played well in his two trials, one at first five eighths and the other at fullback, and his record for the Bay made him a worthy selection. On the hard grounds of South Africa Furlong sometimes struggled but he played in 11 of the tour matches, nine at first five and two at fullback, and gained his cap in the fourth test of the series. A competent kicker, he contributed 32 points from 10 conversions, three penalties and a dropped goal. He had another trial in 1971 but was not considered for that year's series against the Lions. His tactical nous was recognised, though, with his appointment as the Bay captain in 1971. He played 12 matches for the Bay in what was his farewell season, including that against the Lions, to bring his total for the union to 77. Furlong later coached and administered at Hawke's Bay union level. But his other sporting passion took over in his later years and he was a long term chief executive of the Central Districts association. Furlong played at first class level for some seasons with the Central Districts Stags and as an off spin bowler in 1965 achieved a hat-trick for New Zealand under 23 against Canterbury. He is the father of cricketer Campbell Furlong. Honours In the 2016 Queen's Birthday Honours, Furlong was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for services to cricket and rugby.

It was formed in 1974 by Senator George Hannan, as a breakaway from the Liberal Party. The party failed to win any seats at the 1974 federal election, and disbanded soon after. Background Hannan was a strident social conservative, and was disturbed by the nonchalance of his party to the new \\"permissive society\\". In August 1973, he lost Liberal preselection for the next federal election to Alan Missen, a noted civil libertarian and social liberal. However, he later said that his formation of a new party was \\"only indirectly connected with my loss of endorsement\\".HANNAN, GEORGE CONRAD (1910–2009), Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate. Retrieved 1 April 2018. Formation In a speech to the Senate on 20 March 1974, Hannan announced his resignation from the Liberal Party and the formation of the National Liberal Party, of which he was to be leader. He said that the new party's platform was \\"firmly based on principles enunciated by Sir Robert Menzies\\" and that it would \\"uphold the best traditional values of the Liberal Party\\".Senate Official Hansard  No. 12, 1974, pp. 427–428. His announcement was unexpected, and was made without informing the Liberal leader, Billy Snedden. On 3 April, the President of the Senate, Magnus Cormack, ruled that Hannan would not be recognised as the leader of a political party for Senate purposes (which would have conferred certain benefits in parliamentary procedure). The new party was officially launched on 31 March, at the Melbourne Town Hall. Hannan announced that the party's policies included abolishing the metric system, ending inheritance tax and sales tax, and reducing parliamentary salaries by ten percent. It was estimated that about 500 people were in attendance, although Hannan had hoped for a crowd of several thousand. Many Liberal Party officials attended as interested observers, but took pains to emphasise to reporters that they had not joined the new party. Past and present MPs in attendance included Alex Buchanan, Horace Petty, and Ivy Wedgwood. The Canberra Times noted that the audience \\"seemed dominated by migrants, including many wearing Croatian badges\\". The Tribune, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, claimed that the party was linked with Croatian nationalist groups and that its Senate candidates had attended a gathering celebrating the creation of the fascist Independent State of Croatia. 1974 election and demise At the 1974 election, the National Liberal Party ran only in Victoria, although Hannan had previously stated that he hoped a branch could be established in New South Wales. It polled just under 24,000 votes, which amounted to 1.3 percent of the state total. The other two candidates on its ticket besides Hannan were Reginald Hollow and Luke Cuni.Legislative election, 1974 > Voting by state > Victoria, Australian Election Archive. Retrieved 1 April 2018. On 3 March 1975, Hannan announced that he was disbanding the party and returning to the Liberals.

The CBR ran 27.629 miles from Washington, D.C., on tracks formerly owned by the Southern Maryland Railroad and then on its own single track through Maryland farm country to a resort at Chesapeake Beach. It was built by Otto Mears, a Colorado railroad builder, who planned a shoreline resort with railroad service from Washington and Baltimore. It served Washington and Chesapeake Beach for almost 35 years, but the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile marked the end of the CBR. The last train left the station on April 15, 1935. Parts of the right-of-way are now used for roads and a future rail trail. HistoryOrigins= In 1891, Baltimore lawyer (and later Maryland governor) Edwin Warfield and others organized the Washington & Chesapeake Beach Railway to connect Washington, D.C., with 3,000 acres (12 km²) of virgin bay front property at Fishing Creek where they would build a resort. Their Chesapeake Beach, Maryland, resort was to be a vacation spot for the rich and middle class alike, with two grand hotels, a boardwalk, racetrack, and amusements. A pier would accommodate Chesapeake Bay excursion steamers from Baltimore, Annapolis, and Eastern Shore points. In 1894 the W&CBR; was granted a charter to incorporate the Town of Chesapeake Beach. The grand schemes of the W&CBR; were never to be implemented, however and the railway was placed in receivership in 1895. A new company, the Chesapeake Beach Railway Company, took up the idea in 1896. In 1897 Otto Mears was placed in control of the company. He started construction in October 1897 at B & O's Alexandria branch north of present Deane Avenue between Benning and Kenilworth. On April 7, 1898, the Chesapeake Beach Railway was given the franchise of the W&CBR.; Mears optimistically anticipated that the railroad would be completed by July 1898. Before it could open, a draw span bridge over the Patuxent River would have to be built below Bristol. The Patuxent River being navigable as far north as Bristol had to be left unencumbered to steamboat traffic. Plans had to be approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers. A contract to construct the bridge was awarded to the Youngstown Bridge Company and after numerous delays, the bridge was fully operational as of May 1899. The CBR entered into successful agreements with the B&O; Railroad to extend service from their Hyattsville station on the Washington Branch and then along the Alexandria Branch for four miles to Chesapeake Junction. Train would go on to Upper Marlboro and on December 5, 1898, the line from Hyattsville to Upper Marlboro was officially opened. Their primary goal was to tap into the Baltimore market by connecting directly with the Baltimore- Washington trains which stopped at Hyattsville. As part of the contract, B&O; built a separate siding in front of its Hyattsville station for CB trains to lay over. Most of the time, they ran two round trips a day. By 1899 the line was completed all the way to Chesapeake Beach, but the hotel was not ready, so the eastern leg of the railroad did not open until June 9, 1900. In April, 1900 the Washington Traction & Electric Company extended the old Columbia H Street car line to Seat Pleasant, connecting with the Chesapeake Beach at the extreme eastern corner of the District. It became the main method for Washington passengers to get to the beach trains. When the Benning Road Power Plant was opened in 1906, a three block section of the railway became a critical part of the freight route for coal heading to the plant. Cars were moved on CBR tracks from the junction with the B&O; to a connection with Washington Railway and Electric Company tracks three blocks away. =Operations= In the early years, trains left Hyattsville and used B&O; tracks to Chesapeake Junction, where Minnesota Avenue NE and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE meet in the Deanwood neighborhood. Then it traveled out of the District on the abandoned right-of- way of the Southern Maryland Railroad. It exited D.C. at Seat Pleasant, where it met with the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway at a stop called District Line. From there, it went through Upper Marlboro, passing over the PRR (Pope Creek Branch), and then on to Chesapeake Beach. On July 7, 1913 their agreement to use B&O; tracks ended and afterwards all CB passenger trains ended their runs at the Seat Pleasant trolley terminal called \\"District Line.\\" Chesapeake Junction remained the railroad's primary freight interchange, but the railroad's rural territory produced little freight. The junction grew steadily more important after the building of the Benning power plant in 1906. Coal destined for the Benning power plant was at first moved into the plant by electric locomotives operating over the tracks of WREC and its successor, Capital Transit. They transferred from the B&O; on about three blocks of the CBR tracks from Chesapeake Junction to the connection to the streetcar and then along the streetcar line past Kenilworth Junction to the plant. The plant was the central power facility for the onetime Washington Railway & Electric Company, the largest of the city's two street railway companies. Later it was inherited by Potomac Electric Power Company and progressively expanded over the years as the city's major generating plant. The streetcar company handled all plant switching and interchange with its own electric locomotives. To avoid the necessity for the CB to switch the cars over the three block stretch between B & O and the trolley interchange, CBR made an agreement in 1919 to allow B & O locomotives to use their track, paying CBR a per-car charge. So the whole operation was carried out on the track of three companies using B&O; and then streetcar locomotives. In the early years, the fare for the round trip train ride from District Line station to Chesapeake Beach was 50 cents (approximately ). Express trains took about 60 minutes to make the trip; “locals” took about 90 minutes. =Southern Maryland Railroad section= In 1884, the Southern Maryland Railroad (SMR) began construction a rail line from Deanwood towards the District line which it eventually planned to connect to Brandywine and the rest of its rail line. They laid out the right-of-way and graded the line, laying down ties and rail by 1886. In 1898, the CBR took possession of this section of railway, presumably via a tax auction and used it for its operation. When the SMR emerged from bankruptcy in 1901 as the Washington, Potomac & Chesapeake Railway (WPC) it sued the CBR in 1902, claiming they still owned the railbed. The case went to the Supreme Court and in 1905 WP&CR; won and took title to the railway. The Chesapeake Beach stopped running on the DC section of the railway, instead stopping at the train station in Seat Pleasant called District Line. Passengers would get there by using the Columbia Railway's street car line from Navy Yard. In 1911, they started leasing the District section of the line and continued until the WPC went out of business in 1918. At that point they purchased the section. =End of the line= The railroad was never financially successful and never paid off any interest on its original one million dollar mortgage. Starting in 1921, when the railroad carried a peak of 352,000 passengers, the increased use of automobiles began to cut into revenue. The destruction of the luxurious Belvedere Hotel by a fire which originally started at Klein's Bakery two blocks away on March 30, 1923, further limited business. In 1929, under new management, an attempt to rehabilitate the line was made and operations continued with the hope that a new ferry across the Chesapeake Bay to a point on Trippe's Bay in Dorchester County would drive new business. The ferry was blocked by the Claiborne- Annapolis Ferry Company, a competing ferry out of Annapolis. A hurricane in 1933 irreparably damaged the resort's facilities, and the subsequent loss of business led to foreclosure and a request for abandonment in 1935. On April 15, 1935, after entering receivership, the last train left Chesapeake Beach. All but the 2.631 miles from the roundhouse at \\"Maryland Park\\" to the junction at Deanwood, which confusingly took on the name of \\"Chesapeake Junction\\" in later years, and the 0.756 mile spur from Chesapeake junction to the PEPCO plant was abandoned, as that section had significant freight business. The remaining section was bought that same year by the East Washington Railway, formed specifically for that purpose, and the rail east of Maryland Park was removed in the summer of 1935 and the best of it sold to plantation railroads in Cuba. Most of the cars were burned and the metal sold for scrap, except for two that were transferred to the East Washington - the Dolores and San Juan - and a mail car. Two of the three remaining engines were transferred to the East Washington as well. =The East Washington Railway= The 3.4 mile long East Washington Railway survived for 40 years after the Chesapeake Beach Railway stopped running in 1935. Its main customers were a liquor wholesaler, a cement company, a bakery and PEPCO, the local power company. PEPCO needed coal delivered to its Benning Road Plant from Chesapeake Junction, the interchange with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. During the late 1930s and early 1940s operations changed with EWR's two secondhand 4-4-0 locomotives switching the hoppers the three blocks between the B&O; and Capital Transit. In 1946 East Washington dieselized, first with a GE 45-ton centercab locomotive, then an ex-U.S. Army 65-ton Whitcomb and finally a former Washington Terminal Alco RS-1. The Seat Pleasant streetcar line was abandoned in 1949, but Capital Transit continued to operate the line to the Benning plant until January 1955 when it sold the section to the East Washington. In 1975 the power plant converted to oil to meet District environmental regulations which resulted in the demise of the East Washington Railway as PEPCO accounted for 97% of their revenue. The last coal train down the PEPCO spur ran on August 18, 1975. In 1978, the railroad, which by then was down to four employees from 10, and a single Whitcomb ceased operations after successfully overcoming a protest of their abandonment by a liquor warehouse owner. The same year they ceased operations, the tracks were sold to Maryland Midland Railway which pulled them up and sold most of the rail and some of the ties. The remainder were kept in storage by the railway. The District of Columbia had considered, in their 1976 bicycle plan, using the railroad right- of-way as a bicycle trail but the opposition of local residents who wanted single-family housing on the strip, budget constraints and the presence of an alternative option along Watts Branch led them to forego that plan. In 1979, planning began to construct 31 detached homes on the portion of right-of-way between 43rd Place and Division Avenue, NE. In 1982, as part of the reconstruction of the westbound Benning Road viaduct, most of the Benning Road Power Plant spur from Burrgoughs Avenue to Foote Street NE was removed. The only remaining section of rail is buried beneath Foote Street. The railway's DC railyard, located north of Sheriff Avenue along the CSX tracks, has been used for parking and for an auto repair facility, but in 2017 work began to convert the property into a major firehouse, EMS and storage facility to replace the one at 4201 Minnesota Avenue. Surviving EW Locomotives All of the diesel locomotives operated by the East Washington Railway survived for many years after the railway itself was abandoned. No. 101, a GE 45-ton centercab, was built in December September 1946. It was retired in 1970 and sold to the Pinto Islands Metals Company in Mobile, Alabama, and for decades has been the plant switcher at the James River Cogeneration Company in Hopewell, VA.https://www.thedieselshop.us/GE_45Ton.HTML The plant was retired in 2019. Following the plant's closing, it was acquired by the Richmond Railroad Museum in Richmond, Virginia.https://www.richmondrailroadmuseum.com/ The locomotive itself was transported from the plant to the museum's satellite yard in Hallsboro, Virginia.https://www.richmondrailroadmuseum.com/ge-45-ton- engine-move No. 102, a Whitcomb 65-ton centercab, was built in July 1944 as U.S. Army 8465. Following the demise of the East Washington Railway it was acquired as the first motive power for the new Maryland Midland Railway. After a career working as a quarry switcher in Ohio, it was acquired by the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway, a tourist line in Ohio.http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/LocoPicture.aspx?id=174464 No. 103, an Alco RS-1, was built in 1944 for the Washington Terminal Company in Washington, DC. It was purchased by the East Washington Railway in April 1968 and sold to Union Equity Grain in Pasadena, Texas, in January 1970. Later acquired by an individual owner, it was stored in Texas until it was damaged in a collision and subsequently scrapped in 2013.https://www.thedieselshop.us/WTC.HTML Stations on the line {  *Chesapeake Junction *District Line *Seat Pleasant *Berry *Ritchie *Marr *Brown *Forestville Hills *Claggett *Upper Marlboro  *Pennsylvania Junction *Mt.

The WB&A; absorbed two older railroads, the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad and the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line, and added its own electric streetcar line between Baltimore and Washington. It was built by a group of Cleveland, Ohio, electric railway entrepreneurs to serve as a high- speed, showpiece line using the most advanced technology of the time. It served Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis, Maryland, for 27 years before the \\"Great Depression\\" and the rise of the automobile forced an end to passenger service during the economic pressures of the 1930s \\"Depression\\" southwest to Washington from Baltimore & west from Annapolis in 1935. Only the Baltimore & Annapolis portion between the state's largest city and its state capital continued to operate electric rail cars for another two decades, replaced by a bus service during the late 1950s into 1968. Today, parts of the right-of-way are used for the light rail line (from Cromwell Station / north Glen Burnie going north to downtown Baltimore and further north through city to Hunt Valley in Baltimore County), rail trail for hiking - biking trails, and roads through Anne Arundel County. HistoryOrigins= The WB&A; was originally incorporated in 1899 as The Potomac and Severn Electric Railway. On April 10, 1900, it changed its name to the Washington and Annapolis Electric Railway and finally, on April 8, 1902, to the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. In 1903, the WB&A; purchased the Annapolis, Washington & Baltimore Railroad (AW&B;) -- formerly the Annapolis & Elkridge Railroad -- which was closed, electrified and reopened. At the same time, it laid an almost straight double-track route parallel to the B&O; and Pennsylvania railroads, but slightly to the east in less populated territory. On February 7, 1908, service began from Liberty Street in Baltimore to its Washington terminal at 15th and H Streets NE. After 1910, the line reached the heart of downtown on 15th Street near the Treasury. Another single track began at the B&O; main line at Annapolis Junction, crossed the WB&A; main line just east of Odenton, and headed east via Millersville and Crownsville to Annapolis. Democratic National Convention of 1912, held at the Fifth Regiment Armory on North Howard Street to nominate Woodrow Wilson as 28th President.National Trust Library Historic Postcard Collection, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries, circa 1912, http://digital.lib.umd.edu/image?pid=umd:90541 The line built by the WB&A;, later called the Main Line, ran from Baltimore to Washington through Bowie, Glenn Dale Hospital, and Glenarden to Fairmont Heights where it met with the Chesapeake Beach Railway just outside Washington at Chesapeake Junction. From there, it continued to Deanwood on the Washington Railway and Electric Company's Seat Pleasant Line, running parallel to the Chesapeake Beach Railroad tracks and across the Benning Road Bridge into downtown Washington. Once onto their own right-of-way, the WB&A;'s expresses regularly hit 60 mph, but street running in the terminal cities slowed their overall time. A typical B&O; express made the trip in 50 minutes, but the best the WB&A; could do was an hour and 20 minutes. Offsetting these handicaps were its cleanliness, lower fares, half-hourly express service, and better-located downtown terminals. = Business Along the Route = 6-car excursion extra departing Annapolis for Washington in 1910 Always looking for new sources of business, the railroad, in 1914, convinced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Fair Association to establish Bowie Race Track along the Main Line. In September 1917, as the U.S. entered World War I, George Bishop, the WB&A;'s well-connected president, persuaded the U.S. Army to acquire land owned by the railroad and open a training facility. Camp Meade was established in the area roughly bounded by the B&O; Washington Branch on the west, the Pennsylvania Railroad on the east, and the South Shore Line of the WB&A; to the south. The installation was supposed to be a temporary facility, used only for the duration of the war (it is still in use today). The WB&A; saw record traffic during this time as a result of freight and passenger service to the camp. In 1918, the railroad was running as many as 84 special trains a day. = Expansion = Share of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad Company, issued 17. May 1921 With the business seemingly successful, the WB&A; purchased the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line in 1921. It became known as the \\"North Shore Line\\" and the Annapolis to Odenton line as the \\"South Shore Line\\". At this time, the B&A; gave up its terminus at the Camden Street Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and started using the WB&A; terminal on Liberty Street (between Lexington and Fayette) in Baltimore. Prior to 1921 the WB&A; and B&A; had run on separate, parallel tracks from Linthicum to Baltimore. But on March 16, 1921, a crossover connected the two parallel tracks at Linthicum operations ceased on the B. & O. track, and a new terminal was built at the southwest corner of South Howard and West Lombard Streets (current site after the early 1970s of Holiday Inn hotel) across from the Baltimore Civic Center (1st Mariner Arena). The WB&A; now consisted of 81 miles of track and the only practical way to get from Washington, D.C., to Annapolis. =Equipment= WB&A; arch window coach shown in 1908 timetable WB&A; arch window coach in 1908 Initial passenger equipment running from Baltimore-Washington to Annapolis was the \\"classic\\" 1900-1910 arch window all wood body truss rod frame interurban coach.

As a result, gross receipts for the railroad began to decline. The railroad only survived because of a law exempting it from taxes. In January 1931, during the Great Depression, the extension of the law failed to pass by one vote and the line went into receivership. The line remained in operation for four more years and was eventually sold at auction in 1935. Evans Products Company of Detroit negotiated to buy the railroad in June 1935, but those negotiations failed and the railroad officially ceased operations on August 20, 1935.http://www.shorpy.com/node/17521 Scrap dealers eventually bought most of the rolling stock. Evans bought the Arlington and Fairfax railroad the next year. Over time, the rails were hauled away, though by the beginning of World War II some remained and at least one post-War home in the area used old rails in lieu of I-beams. The right of way within Washington, D.C., remained under the ownership of WRECo and then the old Capital Transit Company. At some point between 1951 and 1956, the tracks in D.C. were removed. The right of way of the North Shore Line and some equipment was bought by the Bondholders Protective Society, who then formed the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad Company, which continued to operate rail passenger service between Baltimore and Annapolis until 1950 and freight service along with diesel passenger buses into the early 1970s to Brooklyn in South Baltimore, connecting with the #6 transit line for streetcars and buses of the old Baltimore Transit Company. While the vast majority of the South Shore division was abandoned and sold for scrap in the 1930s, the portion between Annapolis Junction and Odenton was purchased and operated by the B&O; to serve Fort Meade until sometime between 1979 and 1981. It too was removed. Only the junction tracks at Annapolis Junction, which are used by an aggregates terminal, and an abandoned spur to the old Nevamar plant in Odenton remain. = Accidents = On June 5, 1908, two of WB&A;'s single-car trains collided at Camp Parole, Maryland. Nine people died as a result of the crash, including Railroad Policeman J.G. Schriner. The trains were ferrying riders to and from the United States Naval Academy for graduation ceremonies at the time of the accident.

The section of the Light Rail going to Glen Burnie (Cromwell Station) uses the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad's parallel right-of-way. * Linthicum railroad station * WB&A; Boulevard in Severn was built on the right-of-way. * A section of railroad track exists in the Academy Junction section of Odenton, Maryland. It branches off of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor just south of MD 175/Annapolis Road and travels east past the Odenton Library and across MD 170/Piney Orchard Parkway at grade before turning north to cross Annapolis Road, also at-grade. It then travels a short distance north to the site of the old Nevamar Company's manufacturing plant. That plant shut down in 2004 and trains haven't run on the spur since. * At the northeast corner of the location where the track listed above crosses MD 170 (Telegraph Road) is a brick building that once housed the WB&A; operations headquarters. The Baltimore-Washington main line and Fort Meade-Annapolis (South Shore) branch crossed at this location, known as \\"Naval Academy Junction.\\" The interlocking tower that controlled this crossing comprised the second floor. Commercial office tenants occupy the building today. * Parts of the Power line Path remains in use to this day. The single circuit 115KV path from WB&A; Road (just south of BWI Airport) to Telegraph Road and Annapolis Road remains with some modifications. Another path was replaced by a double circuit 115KV monopole from Pumphrey to Linthicum. Both are now lines used by BGE. * The \\"Naval Academy Junction\\" shops sat about north of \\"Naval Academy Junction,\\" on the east side of MD 170. The brick shop buildings were subsumed into a larger building complex that housed a number of manufacturing companies, including Nevamar Plastics, but those shops were torn down in 2013. The electrical power plant for this section of the WB&A; overhead still stands, and is visible from MD 170. * Two portions of the WB&A; Trail, one from Odenton Town Center to the Two Rivers development and another section from the Patuxent River to Glenn Dale, run on the old right-of-way of the Main Line. These two portions of the trail are not connected due, in part, to a property dispute that diverted the trail west in Anne Arundel County where a bridge will be built later. * The trestle over Horsepen Branch on the Bowie Race Track spur, and short sections of roadbed on either side of the trestle. (A nearby rail trail signed \\"WB&A; Spur Trail\\" branches off of the WB&A; Trail and was built on a route that once served the race track, but the route was actually constructed subsequent to the WB&A;'s demise, by the Pennsylvania Railroad.). * MD 704 was built on the right-of- way. * A freight motor, Washington Baltimore & Annapolis #1, is maintained at the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California.  Acquisition  Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail and the Northeast Maglev = In 2015, Baltimore-Washington Rapid Rail (BWRR) announced that the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) approved BWRR’s application to acquire a passenger railroad franchise previously held by the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad Company. BWRR and the Northeast Maglev are working to deploy a Superconducting Maglev (SCMAGLEV) system that would connect Washington and Baltimore in 15 minutes. The Northeast Maglev is currently working with the Federal Railroad Administration and Maryland Department of Transportation, the project sponsor, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed superconducting maglev system.

The Agawam Canal Co., 6 Cush. 75 (Mass. 1850), was a case in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that contributed to the \\"fellow servant rule\\". Background A worker at a cotton manufacturing establishment sued her employer for injuries she sustained during the course of employment. Another employee, the superintendent of the plant, had been grossly negligent in instructing his subordinate, an overseer, who was in charge of the gas lighting. As a result, gas filled the room in which the plaintiff was working so as to \\"throw her into spasmodic fits, and occasion her a very serious and lasting injury.\\" (The overseer was \\"hired and discharged by the superintendent, usually with the advice of the treasurer ... the overseers of the rooms hired and discharged the operatives employed in their respective rooms ... all these officers and operatives were paid for their services by the paymaster of the defendants, at their counting-room.\\") It was admitted that the plaintiff received the injury \\"through the gross negligence and want of skill of the superintendent, in directing the person employed in the manufacture of the gas, with which the mill was lighted, to throw off all the weights from the gasometer, by means of which the gas was forced into the mill;\\" and it was admitted \\"that the management of lighting the mill, and manufacturing gas for the purpose, was a matter under the control of the superintendent.\\" The applicable rule exempted an employer from liability to one employee for the negligence of its other employees since the injured employee was said to have \\"assumed the risk.\\" Opinion of the court The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts logically extended the rule to include that superintendent as a fellow-servant, just another employee whose negligence in injuring a different employee would not render the employer liable. The injured employee presumably assumed the risk that even the superintendent might be grossly negligent. =Excerpt= ::This case cannot be distinguished in principle from the case of Farwell v. Boston and Worcester Railroad, 4 Met. 49; and the same point has been since adjudged in the case of Hayes v. Western Railroad, 3 Cush. 270. ::The principle of these decisions is, that when one person engages in the service of another, he undertakes, as between him and his employer, to run all the ordinary risks of the service, and this includes the risk of negligence on the part of others in the service of the same employer, whenever he, such servant, is acting in the discharge of his duty to his employer, who is the common employer of both.... ::It cannot affect the principle, that the duties of the superintendent may be different, and perhaps may be considered as of a somewhat higher character than those of the plaintiff; inasmuch as they are both the servants of the same master, have the same employer, are engaged in the accomplishment of the same general object, are acting in one common service, and derive their compensation from the same source. ::The plaintiff and the superintendent must be considered as fellow-servants, within the principle and meaning of the cases above referred to, and the other adjudged cases on this subject. There is no allegation, that the superintendent was not a fit and proper person to be employed by the defendants to perform the duties assigned to him, but only that he was chargeable with negligence and unskillfulness, on the particular occasion when the plaintiff was injured in the manner described. It would have presented a very different case, if the defendants had employed an unfit and improper person, and in that way the plaintiff had been exposed to and had suffered injury. ::In the decision of the case of Farwell v. Boston and Worcester Railroad , the case of Priestly v. Fowler, 3 M. & W. 1, was referred to as an authority in point. There have recently been two other English cases (Hutchinson v. York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway, 5 W. H. & G. 343; Wigmore v. Jay, Ib. 354,) which fully sustain the doctrine and decision of Priestly v. Fowler. It is very clear, therefore, upon the adjudged cases, that this action cannot be maintained, and that judgment must be entered for the defendants.

She is introduced to Claudio, the restaurant staff, and Olga's new husband, Lorenzo. Olga loans a furnished apartment to Nicoletta. Episode 2: While searching for a job, Nicoletta runs into Luciano and his grandson. Something that the grandson says inspires her to ask Olga for a job at the restaurant. Claudio walks Nicoletta home through the rain, and she tells him that she has feelings for him. Later, Claudio's ex-wife comes to the restaurant for dinner, and Nicoletta interrupts a conversation between Claudio and his ex-wife. Nicoletta is left wondering why Claudio really wears his wedding ring. Episode 3 After a conversation with Luciano, Claudio begins to avoid Nicoletta. Nicoletta and Olga have a conversation about Nicoletta's feelings for Claudio, and she realizes that she is in love with him. Episode 4 When an old sous chef stops by for a dinner with the owner and his wife, Nicoletta has a chance to learn a bit of the history of the Casetta dell'Orso. Episode 5 The owner and Gigi (the sommelier) are half-brothers, and also cousins—the owner's father had an affair with *his* brother's wife. As a result of the affair, Gigi and the owner didn't meet until they were in their twenties, when they hit it off well, and decided their fathers' feud had nothing to do with them. Gigi observes people closely --- it's how he's able to pick just the right wine for them --- so he's figured out that Nicoletta is Olga's daughter. Episode 6 Vito (the tall, bald campiere) is a lady's man who dearly loves his wife. Together with several of the other staff of Casetta dell'Orso, they set another young lady's man straight. Episode 7 Luciano's grandson has a birthday coming up, and for Luciano, the staff of Casetta dell'Orso are willing to go all out. Episode 8 A glimpse into Claudio's past --- back when he dropped dishes all the time and spilled wine on the blouses of rich ladies. Claudio's reminisces are used as a foil for Nicoletta's dish- dropping and general unhandiness around the kitchen. The occasion of these reflections is the arrival of Angela, the wife of Furio the head chef. Angela was the daughter of the hotel-owner where Claudio got his start --- Furio was a chef there who showed Claudio some kindness. Angela arrives with the hotel manager who fired Claudio. The manager, who has retired, but is in town for a visit, does not recognize Claudio, and is terrifically impressed with Claudio, wondering where he learned such skills as a waiter. Episode 9 The heating is broken, so the restaurant is closed. It's not empty, though --- the kitchen staff are trying out dishes for the spring menu, with Nicoletta trying to scrape together something palatable. Reflections on Teo's tumultuous past with Vanna. Again, foils for Nicoletta. Just as Teo is dismissive of Nicoletta's skills as a cook, Vanna was dismissive of Teo. Episode 10 A comparison between Luciano (who rejects the advances of a woman, because he has not forgotten his dead wife), and Claudio (who cannot let go of his love for his ex-wife). Mixed in: Gabriella, Claudio's ex, keeps coming to the restaurant. Nicoletta confronts her, telling her it is cruel to come so often, since she knows how Claudio feels. Episode 11 The conclusion of the arc begun in episode 10. Luciano tells Claudio directly that it is time he removed his wedding ring. Olga's birthday. Nicoletta bakes her a cake. Olga is so moved, and moved by the events surrounding Claudio and his wife --- who is Olga's business partner --- that she confesses that Nicoletta is her daughter. Lorenzo tells her he has known since Nicoletta started work at the Casetta dell'Orso: Nicoletta and Olga have the same smile. The series ends with Nicoletta noticing that Claudio no longer wears his wedding ring.

Her marriage to Art violated the Statutes of Kilkenny, and resulted in her property being forfeited to the English crown.Thomas B. Costain, The Last Plantagenets, p.126 This caused her husband to declare war in Ireland against the forces of King Richard II of England.Thomas B. Costain, The Last Plantagenets, p. 126 Family Elizabeth was born at Norragh, County Kildare, Ireland on an unknown date, the daughter and heiress of Sir Robert le Veel of Norragh. Norragh had been in her family since the manors of Norragh and Skethness, (now Skerries, Dublin) were granted to her ancestor Sir Michael le Veel in 1320. Her family is better known by the name Calf, which is the Anglicised version of le Veel. Marriages and issue In 1374 upon the death of her father she married her first husband Sir John Staunton of Otymy, County Kildare, (now Clane) who died before 1390. She had at least one child by Sir John, a daughter Elizabeth who would marry into the Wellesley family. In 1390, Elizabeth married her second husband, Art mac Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh, King of Leinster (1357-1417). The marriage produced at least three sons: * Diarmait Lavderg (died 1417) * Donnchadh mac Art MacMurrough, Lord of Garyshill, King of Leinster (reigned 1417-1455), fathered a son, Murtough Kavanagh, who was the heir to the kingdom of Leinster * Gerald Kavanagh, Lord of Ferns (died 1431). He is the direct ancestor of the present day MacMurrough-Kavanaghs. The marriage between Art and Elizabeth violated the Statutes of Kilkenny which prohibited intermarriage between the English and the Irish. Art also claimed the important barony of Norragh by right of his wife who had inherited the barony suo jure in 1374, when her father died. When the barony was forfeited to the English crown in 1391, Art declared war against the English. King Richard II arrived in Ireland in 1394, at the head of an army which consisted of over 8,000 men. The English suffered many casualties due to the covert attacks Art perpetrated against King Richard's men. Finally a truce was reached in 1395; Art went to Dublin where he swore fealty to King Richard and received the honour of a knighthood.Costain, The Last Plantagenets, pp.167-68 The barony on Norragh was restored to him. However, when the king departed for England in May 1395, Art renounced his fealty and proceeded to harass the English who lived in the Pale. In 1398, when Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and King Richard's heir apparent, was killed at the Battle of Kells in a skirmish with an Irish clan, the English king sought revenge against Art. King Richard lead a second expedition to Ireland in 1399, and Art's lands of Norragh were once again forfeited to the English crown. However, it was this last expedition to Ireland which cost the king his throne; as he had brought with him most of his household knights and loyal nobles. Upon his return to England, King Richard discovered that the kingdom had fallen into the hands of his cousin, Henry of Bolingbroke, who would subsequently imprison and depose Richard, and reign as King Henry IV. Elizabeth le Veel died on an unknown date. NotesReferences * Thomas B. Costain, The Last Plantagenets, published by Popular Library, New York, 1962, originally published by Doubleday and Co., Inc.

Born in 1908 in Japanese Taiwan, Hsu opposed colonialism at an early age. As a student, she refused to acknowledge Hirohito's birthday and defended others who spoke Hokkien. Hsu later became the first Taiwanese woman to earn a doctorate. She was also the first female high school principal and city council member in Taiwan. In 1940, Hsu and her husband established a hospital in Chiayi City. Hsu joined the Kuomintang after their arrival in Taiwan in 1945, and was later elected to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. She attempted to withdraw from the party three times, after disagreeing with the suspension of county commissioner Lee Mao-sung before courts had ruled on charges of corruption against him. She was reelected to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly as an independent in April 1957. Hsu was formally expelled from the Kuomintang in 1958, because she had joined the Chinese Local Autonomy Research Society. As an assembly member, Hsu became known for asking rigorous questions of the ruling party, and was one of six Taiwan-born provincial legislators, referred to as . In 1960, she worked with Lei Chen to establish the China Democracy Party. It was shut down shortly thereafter, and Lei was arrested. Hsu joined the tangwai movement soon afterwards, coordinating a campaign team for independent candidates from January 1961. She was elected mayor of Chiayi City in 1968, and was the first woman to be elected mayor in Taiwan. Hsu left the provincial legislature after four terms to assume the mayoralty. By the end of Hsu's mayoral term in 1972, the Kuomintang had instituted an age limit of 60 for local offices, making it illegal for her to run for a second term. Instead, Hsu campaigned for a seat on the Legislative Yuan, leading the December 1972 elections with the highest vote total. She stepped down in 1981, choosing to launch a second mayoral campaign in Chiayi because the age limit had been lifted. Hsu died in office in 1983. Two of her daughters, Chang Po-ya and , later served as Mayor of Chiayi. A museum dedicated to Hsu opened in 2014.

They have revolutionized healthcare for the poorest people in India and have overseen a programme that has substantially reduced infant mortality rates in one of the most poverty-stricken areas in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have endorsed their approach to treating newborn babies and the programme is currently being rolled out across India and in parts of Africa.http://www .Global development, Infant and child mortality, Elizabeth Day – The Observer, Sunday 20 March 2011 Dr Abhay Bang: the revolutionary pediatrician (Accessed on 28 November 2012) The Bangs founded the 'Society For Education, Action and Research in Community Health' (SEARCH)Official website of SEARCH (Archived on 7 November 2012) – a non- profit organisation, which is involved in rural health service and research. The couple is the winner of the Maharashtra Bhushan Award. Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow has conferred honorary doctorates on Abhay and Rani Bang. SNDT Women's University, Mumbai has also awarded Honoris Causa to Rani Bang.SNDT Women's University Convocation Rani Abhay Bang The Lancet has honoured the couple as 'the pioneers of health care in rural India'. Abhay and Rani Bang are the first recipients of the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. They were also inducted into the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars. The Bangs are honoured for their leadership in community-based health care that is now helping to save the lives of millions of the most vulnerable newborns and children. During their careers, the Bangs have helped foster a renaissance in community-based primary health care. In 2016, Johns Hopkins University conferred the Distinguished Alumni Award upon them.Loksatta डॉ. राणी व डॉ. अभय बंग यांना जॉन्स हॉपकिन्स विद्यापीठाचा पुरस्कार (Accessed on 3 April 2016)  Personal life and background  Abhay Bang was born at Wardha, Maharashtra, India in 1950 to Thakurdas Bang and Suman Bang. His parents were followers of the Sarvodaya movement which was inspired by Gandhian thoughts. His father, a young economist, went to Mahatma Gandhi to seek his blessings when he was about to go to the United States for his doctoral studies. Gandhi looked at him for few seconds, then said, \\"Young man, if you want to study economics, go to the villages of India\\" Thakurdas cancelled his planned voyage, and remained in India to study the economics of Indian villages. Abhay spent his childhood in Gandhi's Sevagram Ashram at Wardha with Mahatma Gandhi's foremost disciple Acharya Vinoba Bhave. Until ninth standard, he studied in a school which followed the tenets of Nai Taleem (a method of practical hands-on Education) as propagated by Gandhiji.My Magical School – Abhay Bang (Accessed on 24 May 2012) When Abhay was 13-years-old, he and his elder brother Ashok, who was 16 years old, would have discussions on what they should do with their lives. Ashok Bang decided to work for issues related to farming and Abhay decided to work for the health of villagers.Meeting with Mahatma – Abhay Bang (Accessed on 8 November 2012) Rani Bang (formerly Rani Chari) was born in Chandrapur. She belonged to a family with strong commitment both to medical service and, in her grandparents' generation, to public service. Abhay and Rani completed their graduation and post graduation in medical studies from Nagpur University. When Abhay was studying for final year exam of MBBS at Nagpur, he read an incident about Gandhi where Gandhi was very careful regarding use of natural resources. After reading the incident Abhay decided to use resources carefully. He switched off the fan in his room. He thought that he should be able to live without fan. He did not use the fan for next five years during his education even in the heat of Nagpur. Abhay and Rani married in 1977. Both of them have secured MPH (Masters in Public Health) from Johns Hopkins University. Anand Bang is their elder son and Amrut Bang is their younger son. Abhay and Rani Bang, along with their younger son Amrut  Education  Abhay and Rani Bang completed their MBBS from Government Medical College, Nagpur, Maharashtra in 1972. Abhay Bang was first in the University in MBBS and had three gold medals. Abhay Bang did his MD in Medicine (with a first position in the University) while Rani Bang did her MD in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (with a first position in the University and gold medal). They helped organise and lead a national group of medical professionals concerned with health-care quality and delivery. After their medical studies, the couple moved to Wardha and co-founded Chetna Vikas – a non-profit organization. While working in villages of Wardha district, Abhay Bang published a study challenging the minimum wages fixed for agriculture labour in Maharashtra, forcing the government to raise the minimum wages. This strengthened their belief in the power of research as a way of solving social problems. They realized the need for further studies in public health to address larger health-care issues. Both of them completed Masters in Public Health from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, America in 1984. The couple had decided to follow Gandhian principles and to work with the poor and thus immediately returned to India after finishing their masters.Alex Perry – Time Magazine – Monday, 31 October 2005 The Listeners (Accessed on 11 November 2012)  Work  After returning to India they started working in Gadchiroli. They founded SEARCH in December 1985 and started working on community health problems in the tribal and rural areas of Gadchiroli. SEARCH established a partnership with communities in Gadchiroli for health and development and helped create \\"tribal-friendly\\" clinics and a hospital in the district. =Reduction in Infant Mortality Rate= When the couple started holding peopledictionary health assemblies they found that addressing infant mortality was a pressing need. The death of a one-month-old child within minutes of being brought to them greatly impacted the couple. They found that there were 18 causes that may have been responsible for that infant's death, ranging from poverty, diarrhea, infection or pneumonia to lack of a hospital. The challenge was how to save an infant who can die of 18 causes. The Bangs and their colleagues at SEARCH conducted world-class research on practical approaches to reduce mortality of young children in resource-constrained settings. Bang's solution was to train the village women in neonatal care. He wrote a draft of the action research to be conducted and sought comments from his mentor, Carl Taylor, the founder of the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University. In a handwritten note on the draft, Taylor wrote 'Abhay, this will be the most important work that you will ever do in your life'.Johns Hopkins Magazine SEARCH Mission(Accessed on 3 April 2016) Subsequent work by Abhay Bang and his colleagues in two of the most notable of their studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of community-based management of childhood pneumonia and the provision of home-based neonatal care by community health workers. Home Based Neonatal Care (HBNC) model developed by Bang has resulted in reduction in infant mortality in the study villages of Gadchiroli. The home-based neonatal care interventions developed at SEARCH ignited worldwide interest and research on preventing neonatal deaths in high-mortality, resource-constrained settings. Prior to that, such deaths were considered nearly impossible to avert. As a result of their work, home-based neonatal care and community-based management of childhood pneumonia are now being implemented throughout the world in these settings. Although initially the medical fraternity objected to Bang's unconventional methods, they gradually understood his wisdom to provide an alternative to a large village community. Later, Indian paediatricians, after studying the evidence from the field, wholeheartedly backed Bang's initiative to save newborns. Today, based on Bang's Gadchiroli model, 800,000 village women in India are now being trained by the government under the ASHA programme. A report from the Harvard University South Asia Institute states that \\"SEARCH is world renowned for its pioneering work in home-based neonatal care\\", \\"the landmark paper, published in The Lancet, changed the medical community's perception of community health workers and the power of home based care for neonates forever\\" and \\"the success of the HBNC program spawned the creation of over 800,000 \\"ASHA\\" workers through India's National Rural Health Mission.\\"Task Shifting in Healthcare, Report by Harvard University (Accessed on 7 July 2017) India has incorporated this model in 12th national five-year plan to reduce infant mortality. This field trial showed that newborn care can be brought out of the confines of big hospitals and high tech units and be so simplified that it can be provided in any village in any home. After this research the global newborn care has never been the same. This approach, which brought down the infant mortality rate in rural Gadchiroli from 121 per 1000 live births to 30, was honoured by The Lancet in 2005 as one of the Vintage Papers. The editor and the historian of the journal considered Bang's paper on newborn care to be one of the milestone ones published in 180 years. This approach has been incorporated in the national program by the Government of India and has been accepted by the WHO, UNICEF and USAID for reducing newborn mortality in developing countries.Brief information about Bang on www.compassioninglobalhealth.org (Accessed on 1 December 2012) Abhay Bang with the Breath Counter he designed In May 2017, the High Court of Bombay invited Abhay Bang to provide suggestions about how to reduce child mortality and malnutrition in the state of Maharashtra. The High Court accepted the suggestions made by Abhay Bang and directed the state government to incorporate the recommendations in its policy decisions and take appropriate actions.The Hindu 4 May 2017 HC accepts report on malnutrition (Accessed on 6 May 2017) = Liquor Ban in Gadchiroli District = Abhay and Rani Bang were driving force for the movement of liquor ban in Gadchiroli district. Gadchiroli is the first district in Maharashtra where liquor is banned due to demand by the public. Bang made people of Gadchiroli aware about ill effects of alcohol, which led to demand from people to ban alcohol in Gadchiroli. Maharashtra government has come up with ban on alcohol in Gadchiroli. In 1990, the couple raised a movement for liquor ban in Gadchiroli district. The movement resulted in liquor ban in the district in year 1992, being the first example in India of liquor ban due to public demand. In May 2012, Abhay Bang was member of panel to study ban of Liquor in chandrapur district.Times of India 12 February 2012 – Nagpur Liquor panel may suggest ban in Chanda (Accessed on 1 December 2012) He advocates the need for an alcohol and tobacco free society since as per the Global Burden of Diseases 2015, alcohol and tobacco are two of the top ten causes of death and disease in India. Abhay Bang is developing a multi-pronged approach named \\"Muktipath\\" in the district of Gadchiroli to reduce the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco consumption there.Sakal Guest Editorial on 25 March 2017 मृत्युपथ विरुद्ध 'मुक्तिपथ’ (Accessed on 8 April 2017) He also welcomed Supreme Court of India's ban on liquor shops on state and national highways.The Indian Express 20 March 2017 None For The Road (Accessed on 8 April 2017) Abhay and Rani Bang = Women's Issues = Rani Bang has worked extensively on women's medical issues. The community based study of gynaecological problems in rural area that she conducted in 1988 is the first study in the world focusing on women's health beyond maternity care. Rani Bang first brought to the notice of the world that rural women had a large hidden burden of gynecological diseases. She subsequently trained the Dais in villages to make them village level health workers. With convincing evidence she advocated the need for a comprehensive reproductive health care package for rural women in India. (Accessed on 16 October 2015) This study initiated the programme of women's reproductive health all over the world specifically in developing countries. She has written a book – Putting Woman First, which throws light on women's issues in rural India. Their research showed that nearly 92 percent of women had some kind of gynaecological issues. Her research in this field has changed the understanding of this issue worldwide and global policy has changed accordingly. Rani Bang was one of the principal speakers in Tietze symposium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1990. She served as a consultant to INCLEN (International Clinical Epidemiology Network) for Reproductive health, IWHAM (International Women's Health Advocates on Microbicides), 10th Five Year Plan Maharashtra Health and Nutrition Committee Member. She was nominated for Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 as a member of 1000 women worldwide for peace prize. Rani Bang has worked on women's reproductive health issues, sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS control, adolescent sexual health, tribal health, alcohol and alcoholism. She conducts sessions on sex education called 'Tarunyabhaan' for adolescents and teenagers across Maharashtra.Sakaal Times, 'Tarunyabhaan', a workshop on sex education (Accessed on 16 October 2015) Rani Bang has been awarded with National Award for Women's Development through Application of Science & Technology in recognition of her outstanding and pioneering contribution for the past two and a half decades on improving women's health in rural India through an innovative and powerful approach of research with the people and for the people. The award was conferred upon her by the President of India at the National Conference on Showcasing Cutting Edge Science & Technology by Women in New Delhi. = Tribal Health = Abhay and Rani Bang have been working with the tribal communities in the forest area of Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra since 1986. They found malaria to pose the biggest health concern for this population. They sought to make the local adivasis aware about the importance of using insecticide-treated mosquito nets, in addition to regular medical treatment. They also run a mobile medical unit in the forty eight tribal villages in the Dhanora block of Gadchiroli district and have a network of village volunteers trained in providing primary care in these villages. In July 2017, the Government of Maharashtra formed a task force to control the spread of malaria in the district of Gadchiroli. Abhay Bang has been appointed as the head of this task force which comprises the nonprofit SEARCH, Tata Trusts, National Institute of Research and Tribal Health (NIRTH) and the Government of Maharashtra.Times of India Govt forms task force to tackle malaria in G’chiroli (Accessed on 25 July 2017) Abhay Bang is chairing a 13-member expert committee set up by Union Health Ministry and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, tasked with coming out with a nationwide status report on tribal health issues along with suggesting possible policy formulations. While the \\"old\\" problems of malaria, malnutrition and mortality persist, Abhay Bang emphasises \\"new\\" health issues among tribals partly due to outside socio-cultural influences and steady inroads by market forces. Tribal women now list alcohol addiction among men as their biggest concern. The same goes with tobacco, with over 60 per cent of adults in Gadchiroli consuming it daily. These, alongside addition of salt in their foods and stress, are contributing to increased incidence of hypertension, according to Bang. The problems of language barrier and lack of motivation among healthcare staff, besides vacancies and absenteeism when it comes to working in tribal areas, has rendered the formal public healthcare system virtually dysfunctional.The Indian Express A pioneering doctor-activist speaks to The Indian Express about the unique health issues confronting India’s tribal communities (Accessed on 18 January 2016) = NIRMAN = In 2006, they started an initiative, NIRMAN, for identifying and nurturing young social change-makers in Maharashtra. It is an educational process to train the youth to take up crucial issues and problems in the society. NIRMAN provides guidance, expertise and environment to inculcate self learning and encourages youth for social action. NIRMAN includes a series of 3 camps, each separated by 6 months. So a batch of NIRMAN goes through 3 camps in a period of 1 year. A camp generally runs for 7–10 days at SEARCH, Gadchiroli. NIRMAN is a learning process based on Nai Talim way of education introduced by Mahatma Gandhi. It believes in – problem based learning instead of – classroom based learning. (Accessed on 16 October 2015) NIRMAN initiative is providing a common platform for youth to engage, self- educate and decide on how they can make a difference to the society. Started in 2006, NIRMAN brings together a group of youth aged between 18–28 years who are looking to give meaning to their lives. Amrut, Abhay and Rani Bang's younger son actively manage NIRMAN.The Times of India, Where youth's discussions veer to country-building (Accessed on 16 October 2015) Abhay thinks that it is important to make present generation of doctors think about social challenges. \\"All doctors can earn enough to make a decent living and they must think about the purpose of their lives. Change would happen the moment they start contemplating.\\" He believes that medical students should regularly be given rural or tribal stints as part of their curriculum so that they are exposed to the real challenges. He thinks that it is equally important to reward doctors who shun the charm of corporate world to serve the real people in need.Doc couple with heart for neglected Times of India, 27 September 2015 (Accessed on 31 October 2015) = Non-Communicable Diseases = Abhay and Rani Bang and their team at SEARCH has started working on the non- communicable diseases (NCDs) as that is emerging as a priority area. A study conducted by SEARCH in 86 villages of Gadchiroli district has shown that rural people are now falling prey to lifestyle diseases like stroke which emerged as the most frequent cause of death. One in seven (14%) deaths in these villages occurs due to stroke, showing that the places like Gadchiroli are now passing through an 'epidemiological transition'. 87.3% stroke deaths occurred at home, indicating that rural people don't approach hospitals for treatment. Taking the study ahead, the SEARCH team now plans to test village based solutions to minimize deaths caused due to stroke in Gadchiroli villages in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust of UK and the department of biotechnology of the government of India. Yogeshwar Kalkonde, Neurologist and Senior Research Officer at SEARCH is the main author of the study. The team also included three young MBBS doctors from Nirman. The study has been published in 'Stroke', an international journal published by American Stroke and Heart Association.Times of India 16 July 2015, Nagpur Stroke is a major cause of death (Accessed on 31 October) The work has been presented at the 5th International Conference on Neurology and Epidemiology (18–20 November 2015) in Australia.5th International Conference on Neurology and Epidemiology, Australia (Accessed on 30 November) In a study published in Economic and Political Weekly, Bang and SEARCH team members showed that the rural and tribal district of Gadchiroli was spending approximately Crore. annually on consuming tobacco and related products.Economic & Political Weekly 2 February 2013 Tobacco vs Development Private Spending on Tobacco in Gadchiroli District (Accessed on 25 January 2016) More than 50% of the population was consuming tobacco. SEARCH has been conducting programs to spread awareness regarding the ill effects of tobacco use and providing de-addiction services. The Maharashtra state government has formed a 12-member task force under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for creating awareness about ill effects of using tobacco products and Abhay Bang is an advisor in the force. It will concentrate on Gadchiroli district for the first three years. A committee has also been constituted under the Gadchiroli District Collector for implementing the plans devised by the task force. A representative of Bang's organization SEARCH will be a member of the committee. According to Bang, spread of information and awareness for prevention, initiation of village committees and urban ward committees, implementation of laws and regulations, treatment for deaddiction, counselling via NGOs and stimulation of an alcohol and tobacco free environment in government offices, schools, colleges, markets etc. will be the methods used by the task force.Times of India, Nagpur 15 January 2016 Task force set up to fight tobacco abuse (Accessed on 25 January 2016) = Surgical Care= The couple, through their organisation SEARCH, built the Maa Danteshwari Hospital for the rural and tribal people of Gadchiroli. Along with OPD and IPD care, a variety of surgeries are also conducted in this setup. Doctors from throughout the state of Maharashtra come and operate in this setup. Spine surgeon from Mumbai, Shekhar Bhojraj and his team of 6 - 8 other spine surgeons have been associated with SEARCH for 10 years and have conducted more than 100 spine surgeries in Gadchiroli. In August 2016, when Rani Bang was to undergo spinal surgery herself, she too was operated in the SEARCH hospital by Shekhar Bhojraj and his wife Shilpa who is an anaesthetist in Mumbai.Times of India 30 August 2016, Nagpur Dr Rani Bang undergoes spine surgery at Gadchiroli’s SEARCH hospital (Accessed on 30 August 2016)  Positions held  Apart from being the founder directors of SEARCH, Abhay and Rani Bang have served on various national and state level committees.

While still a student at the college, he was offered the then vacant position of Director of the Music Department in 1898.Tom Riemenschneider and Laura Kennelly: \\"The Baldwin-Wallace College Bach Legacy At 75 Years\\" This department then became under his directorship the Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory of Music.The Conservatory of Music at Baldwin-Wallace: A few words about our history...

In 1947 he retired as director of the conservatorium, but returned later to serve as Acting President for one year. He was invited by the Library of Congress to hold a lecture on Bach in 1950, but it had to be presented posthumously. The most enduring publication of his scholarly works was his Bach — 371 Harmonized Chorales and 69 Chorale Melodies with Figured Bass, ed. Albert Riemenschneider, G. Schirmer, NY, 1941 (see also List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach). Selma Riemenschneider continued the management of the Bach festival until 1954. In 1951 she donated Albert's collection of rare Bach manuscripts to Baldwin- Wallace College, founding a library which in 1969 became the Riemenschneider Bach Institute.

Said describes the book as the third and last in a series of books (the first two were Orientalism and The Question of Palestine) in which he analyzes the relations between the Islamic world, Arabs and East and West, France, Great Britain and the United States. Covering Islam deals with issues during and after the Iranian hostage crisis, and how the Western media has speculated on the realities of Islamic life. Said questions the objectivity of the media, and discusses the relations between knowledge, power and the Western media. Synopsis Said postulates that, if knowledge is power, those who control the modern Western media (visual and print) are most powerful because they are able to determine what people like or dislike, what they wear and how they wear it, and what they should know and must not know about themselves. Human intellect enables a person to think, ponder, contemplate and question. Intellect is, according to Islam, what makes a person unique as an individual. A human, by nature, is a rational being, but the western media wants a person to be irrational—in the sense of accepting or agreeing to an idea without verifying, thinking about or questioning it. In other words, says Said, irrationalism means to let one person think and decide for another—to let one person control others. Said refers to the media's ability to control and filter information as an 'invisible screen', releasing what it wants people to know and blacking out what it does not want them to know. In the age of information, Said argues, it is the media that interprets and filters information—and Said claims that the media has determined very selectively what Westerners should and should not know about Islam and the Muslim world. Islam is portrayed as oppressive (women in Hijab); outmoded (hanging, beheading and stoning to death); anti-intellectualist (book burning); restrictive (bans on post- and extramarital affairs, alcohol and gambling); extremist (focusing on Algeria, Lebanon and of course Egypt); backward (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan); the cause of worldwide conflict (Palestine, Kashmir and Indonesia); and dangerous (Turkey and Iran). The modern Western media, says Said, does not want people to know that in Islam both men and women are equal; that Islam is tough on crime and the causes of crime; that Islam is a religion of knowledge par excellence; that Islam is a religion of strong ethical principles and a firm moral code; that socially Islam stands for equality and brotherhood; that politically Islam stands for unity and humane governance; that economically Islam stands for justice and fairness; and that Islam is at once a profoundly spiritual and a very practical religion. Said claims that untruth and falsehood about Islam and the Muslim world are consistently propagated in the media, in the name of objectivity, liberalism, freedom, democracy and ‘progress’.

Background Despite Houston's victory over Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto, Texans continued to fight a naval war in hopes of persuading the Mexican Government to agree to the independence of Texas. In May 1837, Texas Navy ship Independence prepared for another cruise to take United States diplomat William H. Wharton to Texas from New Orleans. Independence had smooth sailing for about seven days when on April 17 she encountered the Mexican brigs Vencedor del Álamo under Francisco López and the Libertador, off the mouth of the Brazos River. Battle The initial sighting of the two Mexican brigs was at about 5:30 am. Outgunned and outmanned Independence fled up Brazos River for protection at the small riverside town of Velasco. The Mexican vessels pursued the Texans, eventually the two brigs came within cannons range several hours later at 9:30 am. Vincedor del Alamo of sixteen 8-pounder guns and 140 men, sailed with Libertador of 100 men, six 12-pounder guns and one 18-pounder. Independence of eight guns total, raised her colors followed by Libertador which then fired the first broadside that had no effect. Shortly afterward Independence fired a broadside with her weather battery of one 9-pounder gun, three 6-pounder guns, and one pivot gun. For two hours, Independence continued up Brazos River with the Mexican brigs in close pursuit, occasionally stopping to fire on each other. By 11:30 am the Texans had reached Velasco, Captain Wheelwright had no choice but to fight to the end, apparently not being able to continue up Brazos River any further. The final engagement took place right in front of the small Texan town and populace, including Texan Secretary of the Navy Samuel Rhoads Fisher. Brazos River The Mexicans not being far behind came within range and Captain Wheelwright ordered his men to engage once more. The shots managed to damage the main top-gallant mast of the Libertador and after another broadside in Libertadors direction, two Mexicans lay dead and a few more were wounded. More shots damaged Libertador foremast and knocked out one of her 12-pounders. However, these broadsides did not slow the Mexican ships, Libertador approached Independence head on while Vincedor del Alamo maneuvered around to Independences other side. The two brigs quickly came within pistol shots range and both fired a mixture of cannon projectiles. This is when a ball smashed through Independence quarter gallery wall and into the Texan captain, taking off three of his fingers on his right hand. Severely wounded and taken below, command of the schooner passed to Lieutenant John W. Taylor who finished the last few moments of battle before receiving orders from Wheelwright to surrender. With this action the battle was over. Aftermath Immediately Independence was boarded, the officers and crew, as well as William Wharton and a half dozen other civilian passengers, were taken prisoner. The Texan fightingmen were barred away in Matamoros, all of the prisoners eventually escaped or were released by the Mexican government. That same day, Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante, in his inaugural address, pledges to reorganize his military to \\"preserve the rights of the nation,\\" which includes the reconquest of Texas. After the capture of the Independence, the Mexican seamen found a long lost 8-pounder gun, which had been captured by the Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto a year earlier. Independence was commissioned into the Mexican Navy's Veracruz Squadron under the name La Independencia and continued to serve in the Gulf of Mexico against the Texans.

Diet Juvenile petrale sole feed on cumaceans, carideans and amphipods, whilst adults will eat shrimps, crabs, epibenthos organisms and other fish, such as herring, hake, anchovy, pollock and other flatfish. Commercial fishing The Petrale sole is an important commercial fish, and has been fished off Oregon since at least 1884. One fishery exists, off the west coast of the United States. Although Petrale sole are native to Alaska and are caught there and in other fisheries, no other designated Petrale sole fishery exists. Between 1995 and 2004 the coastwide catch of Petrale sole ranged from 1,616 to 2,377 tonnes. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has established Acceptable Biological Catch limits for the annual harvests of petrale sole in the waters off the US west coast; from 1995 to 2000 the coastwide total annual catch did not exceed the catch limit, but from 2001 the catch in the Northern assessment area has exceeded the portion of the catch limit attributed to that area. The estimated biomass of petrale sole in the northern segment of the fishery reached a historical low of 1,267 tonnes in 1992, but has increased steadily since then to 4,960 tonnes in 2005. The southern segment reached a historical low of 1,012 tonnes in 1986, and, after remaining stable for ten years, by 2005 it had increased to 4,667 tonnes. Petrale sole was declared overfished in 2009 and then rebuilt in 2015 after a period of reduced catches.

Even before the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling making same-sex marriage legal across all the states of the United States, same-sex marriage was legal in all of the New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, as well as in the neighboring states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. The New England region has been noted for being the nucleus of the same-sex marriage movement in the United States,A Push Is On for Same-Sex Marriage Rights Across New England, New York Times, April 4, 2009 with the region having among the most widespread and earliest legal support of any region. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage, to be followed by three more states between October 2008 and June 2009. This followed Vermont being the first-in-the-nation with civil unions in 2000. Before the 2012 election, California (2008), Iowa (2009), New York (2011) and the District of Columbia (2010) had been the only U.S. jurisdictions outside New England to have performed same-sex marriages, though same-sex marriages in California had been halted following the passage of Proposition 8. The legalization of same-sex marriage was part of a campaign which began in November 2008, called Six by Twelve, and was organized by the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) to legalize same-sex marriage in all six New England states by 2012.'Gay marriage' bill passes N.H. Senate, Baptist Press, April 24, 20096x12: Half-way There and Going Strong! , GLAD, April 14, 2009 The region holds a number of firsts on same-sex marriage: Vermont was the first state to enact it through legislative means and not because of a judicial ruling, and Maine was the first state to have a governor sign a same- sex marriage bill that was not the result of a court decision. Maine's first gay marriage law was repealed through a people's veto, but three years later, on November 6, 2012, the question was put to voters a second time, and Maine became one of three first US states to approve same-sex marriage at the ballot box, along with Washington and Maryland. With Rhode Island legalizing same sex marriage, all New England states have same-sex marriage. There have been numerous reasons given for why New England has found such strong legal recognition for same-sex marriages in comparison to the rest of the United States. Overview New England is the first region of the country where all states within it have granted marriage rights to same-sex couples. The rapid makeover of its legal landscape made New England a notable standout within the United States. In other parts of the country, while support for same-sex marriage had been gaining steadily, it was still a minority view. Only two states and one district outside the region, Iowa, neighboring New York and the District of Columbia, had allowed same-sex marriage before the 2012 election; voters in California struck down a law supporting such marriages during the fall of 2008. Although the same-sex marriage movement started here nine years ago, when Massachusetts became the first state to legalize it, its growing foothold in the region was not certain. Though politically liberal, New England has not experienced a social revolution similar to California's. =Possible reasons= There were several reasons given for the strong legal recognition in New England, in contrast to the rest of the United States. For instance, New England has strong libertarian associations,Gay Marriage Advances in Maine, The New York Times, Abby Goodnough and Katie Zezima, May 5, 2009 and other social movements, such as abolition of slavery and women's suffrage, started in New England. In addition, voters in most New England states cannot initiate constitutional amendments, which has been a common strategy in preventing same-sex marriage elsewhere. By polling There are a number of demographics which worked to same-sex marriage proponents' favor: #New England is regarded as the least religious region of the country, and religiosity has been tied in polls to opposition to same-sex marriage. #There are a large number of Democrats in New England, and Democrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to support same-sex marriage. #New England has higher education attainment levels than the rest of the country,Polls show Pa. resisting tide favoring gay marriage, Philadelphia Daily News, Will Bunch, May 19, 2009 and polling has shown that support for gay marriage rises with education levels.Value War, Paul Ryan Brewer, Rowman & LittlefieldThe politics of same-sex marriage, Craig A. Rimmerman, Clyde Wilcox, University of Chicago PressSame-sex Marriage, Field Research Corporation , 2003 By culture There have been a number of opinions made on possible cultural factors that could have contributed to the strong legal support in New England: #New Englanders outside Massachusetts share media markets and do not believe they have seen negative consequences from the state's legalization of same-sex marriage there.New England leads on same-sex marriage, NECN, May 7, 2009Massachusetts lets out-of-state gay couples marry, USA Today, July 31, 2008 As well New Englanders have seen same-sex unions for a decade, since Vermont was the first in the nation with civil unions in 2000. #Same-sex couples have found more acceptance in New England for over a century, for instance \\"Boston marriages\\" between women in the 19th century. #There is a view of religion as private and personal, and a separation of one's own beliefs from politics, that does not necessarily exist in other regions of the countryN.E.'s identity bolsters gay marriage tolerance, The Boston Globe, Jenna Russell, May 11, 2009 #Catholics, who dominate the region's religious landscape, were at one point a persecuted minority, and may see their own past reflected in the modern LGBT community. #The presence of GLAD in the region, which is based in Boston. =\\"Six by Twelve\\" campaign= The 6×12 campaign, led by GLAD and working with other statewide groups, began on November 18, 2008, the fifth anniversary of Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, which legalized same-sex marriage in Massachusetts,Five Years After Goodridge, GLAD Announces “6x12”, GLAD, November 18, 2008 with the goal of bringing same-sex marriage to all of New England by 2012. The campaign began a week after same-sex marriage was brought to Connecticut, and the campaign is striving for New England to be a \\"marriage equality zone.\\"Same-sex marriage bills gain in N.E., The Boston Globe, David Abel, March 24, 2009 To achieve this, groups have been raising money, training volunteers and lobbying voters and lawmakers as part of this campaign, led by GLAD, which is a legal advocacy group and the group which persuaded the Supreme Courts in Massachusetts and Connecticut to allow same-sex marriage in 2003 and 2008.Iowa a Midwestern maverick on same-sex marriage, San Francisco Chronicle, April 5, 2009 The campaign has been working primarily through state legislatures, and looking towards the future the campaign sees this as a road map for the rest of the country in 2012.Gay marriage backers target New England, Washington Times, January 4, 2009 Some same-sex marriage opponents initially doubted that there was enough support for legislatures to pass laws for same-sex marriage; doubters also saw how same-sex marriage previously only advanced through the judiciary.Same-sex 'marriage' enthusiasts target New England , One News Now, January 16, 2009 But within seven months into the campaign, same-sex marriage laws were passed in four more states, although Maine's law was repealed by a people's veto on November 3, 2009 funded heavily by organizations from outside the state. However, in the 2012 election, same-sex marriage in Maine was approved by popular vote, meaning five of the six states had legalized same- sex marriage. The full sweep was brought by Rhode Island's legislature passing same-sex marriage the following May. By stateConnecticut= On November 12, 2008, Connecticut joined Massachusetts as the second state in the U.S. to allow same-sex couples to marry. =Maine= A bill to allow same-sex marriage in Maine was signed into law on May 6, 2009.

Three years later, on November 6, 2012, the voters in Maine approved same-sex marriage, becoming the first state to do so by popular vote. =Massachusetts= Same-sex marriage in the U.S. state of Massachusetts began on May 17, 2004, as a result of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruling in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that it was unconstitutional under the Massachusetts constitution to allow only opposite- sex couples to marry. Massachusetts became the sixth jurisdiction in the world (after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec) to legalize same-sex marriage. It was the first U.S. state to make same-sex marriages legal. =New Hampshire= Civil unions began on January 1, 2008; legislation for full marriage rights began in March 2009. A bill legalizing same-sex marriage was signed on June 3, 2009. Same-sex marriages began on January 1, 2010. =Rhode Island= Same-sex marriage was recognised in Rhode Island but not performed until legalized in 2013. Bills were introduced to the Rhode Island General Assembly every year since 1997, and after the Republican governor (who promised to veto it if passed) left office, things gained traction.Rhode Island marriage advocates look to 2011, Edge, May 7, 2009 Nevertheless, the odds against same-sex marriage in Rhode Island were considered rather higher than in the rest of New England, primarily on account of the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. The state has taken a more conservative stance on several social issues in the past, including abortion. After 16 years, bills passed final votes and were signed into law by Governor Lincoln Chafee on May 2, 2013, with same-sex marriage set to begin on August 1. =Vermont= In April 2009, Vermont legalized same sex marriage, and became the first state to do it through the legislature and not judicial review. The vote came nine years after Vermont adopted its \\"first-in-the- nation\\" civil unions law in 2000,Vermont legalizes gay marriage, Burlington Free Press, April 7, 2009 which was the first place in the United States to extend full legal recognition to same-sex couples.

By default, RUSs are established by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) unless the latter objects within 60 days. The L&C; RUS was established on 28 October 2008. The L&C; RUS was the second of no fewer than 5 RUSs which cover specific routes in the north-west of England; the others are the North West RUS (NWRUS, published May 2007), the Yorkshire & Humberside (published July 2009), the Merseyside RUS (published March 2009), and the West Coast main Line RUS (scheduled for publication in the second half of 2009). Officially the RUS area corresponds exactly to Network Rail's Route 23 - North West Rural, but in practice includes both routes to Blackpool from Preston, part of Route 20. As with other RUSs, the L&C; RUS took into account a number of responses,First TransPennine Express responseNorth West Rail Campaign including the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) .ORR's response to consultation As has become customary with RUSs, the recommendations are nominally grouped into Control Periods (CP): CP4 - to the end of March 2009, CP5 - to 2014, and the longer term (CP6 and beyond). The great majority of recommendations are focussed on CP4. The RUS received the following issues from the North West RUS (NWRUS): * improving the link between Preston – Ormskirk so that the service between Liverpool and Preston can be enhanced * extending local Manchester services to Accrington and Burnley * enabling services to run between Southport and Preston. Some issues were passed to later RUSs: Merseyside; Yorkshire & Humber; West Coast Main Line. The situation at the time of the RUS The great majority of the route mileage has permitted line speeds between 55 and 60 miles per hour (mph), with shorter sections of both higher and lower speeds. Junctions are no faster than 30 mph, with significant numbers rated at lower speeds, down to 10 mph in some cases. The only W9/W10 freight route is the Heysham to West Coast Main Line via Morecambe route; most of the network is restricted to W6 or W7. The Settle and Carlisle route carries a considerable amount of coal traffic. The region carries about 10.2 million passengers per year, divided as follows: * between stations in the RUS area: 29% * between the RUS area and the rest of the North West: 40% * between the RUS area and other regions: 31%. Unlike most RUSs, capacity for the number of passengers wishing to travel is a problem only in very localised places. Crowding occurs in peak-time commuter routes into Manchester, but that was already addressed in the NWRUS. There is a particular issue on the Cumbrian Coast line at Sellafield and occasionally at Carlisle. Sporadic crowding occurs on the Carlisle-Leeds and Morecambe-Leeds routes. Generally much more of an issue are the relatively poor state of regional links. The following potential route links are characterised as 'missing': * Southport-Preston * Accrington-Manchester * Burnley-Manchester * Burnley- Bradford (and Leeds). The following links are characterised as 'weak': * Barrow-West Cumbria, 7 trains daily and long journey times * Carlisle-Bradford (and Leeds), 6 trains daily and long journey times * Lancaster-Bradford (and Leeds), 4 trains daily. Generic gaps Certain generic gaps are identified: # links between centres and to outside main destinations are relatively poor # the service level is not generally attractive to commuters # the potential alleviation of social derivation # the infrequent services are not generally attractive for tourism # network capability restrains better and more attractive services # on several route performance is poor # interchange facilities are not adequate Specific interventions recommended in CP4 In the detail below the generic gaps addressed (as above) are included in brackets. =Cumbrian Coast= * Barrow-Sellafield: lengthen the two existing peak trains in both peaks (2) * Whitehaven-Sellafield: extra peak train in both peaks (2) * Carlisle-Barrow: improve frequency, to hourly if possible, using extra units required for peak service (1,2,3) * Barrow-Lancaster: provide an hourly service at main stations served (1,2,3) * Carlise- Whitehaven: one additional Sunday service (1,3,4) * Minor infrastructure enhancements within scheduled renewals (1,2,6) =Settle and Carlisle= * Two-hourly Carlisle-Leeds service, with improved connections (2,4) * Redouble track between Carlisle South Junction and London Road Junction (5,6) * Optimise maintenance and renewals (1,2,4,5) =Roses line= * Extended peak Manchester Victoria-Blackburn services to Clitheroe (1,2,3) * Line speed improvements ** east of Burnley Manchester Road (1,5,6) ** Blackburn-Clitheroe (1,5,6) ** Colne branch (5,6) =Preston-Ormskirk= * Preston-Ormskirk: hourly service, speeded up using moderate infrastructure improvements (1,2) =Morecambe-Leeds= * Cut back to Skipton at east end and possibly Lancaster at west end to provide roughly 90-minute interval service (1,2,4) =Other improvements= Station interchange * Preston * carlisle * Ormskirk * Blackburn * Burscough Junction Train lengthening Services to Clitheroe may be strengthened by train lengthening (subject to funding) and extending the peak service between Manchester and Blackburn.

He had a particular connection with Horatio Nelson, who served under Lutwidge as a midshipman on an expedition to the Arctic in in 1773, and again in 1801 while a captain, when Lutwidge was commander in chief in the Downs. Lutwidge served for a considerable period and in a number of ships, in American waters during the War of Independence. During this time he captured a number of American privateers, and was involved in operations on Lake Champlain. He reached flag rank soon after the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, and served mainly in Home waters as commander in chief of some of the stations on the south coast. He retired from active service with the rank of admiral, and died in 1814, shortly before the end of the Napoleonic Wars. He was the great-uncle of Lewis Carroll. Early life Lutwidge was born on 13 March 1737, the son of Thomas Lutwidge of Whitehaven and his second wife Lucy nee Hoghton. Lutwidge embarked on a career in the Navy, and is listed as a lieutenant in 1763, taking command of the purchased cutter in April that year. He remained with her until 1765, serving in the area of Liverpool. Arctic voyage John Cleveley Lutwidge, by now a commander, commissioned the bomb vessel in June 1771, and served in the Irish Sea until the Carcass was paid off in April 1773. The Carcass was then refitted at Sheerness between March and April for a voyage to the Arctic, with Lutwidge retaining command. The expedition, under the overall command of Constantine Phipps, who commanded , sailed from the Nore on 10 June 1773. The expedition sailed up to and around Spitsbergen, managing to reach within ten degrees of the North Pole, but was prevented from travelling further north by thick sea ice, and returned to Britain in September. Sailing with the Carcass was a young Horatio Nelson, whose position as a midshipman on the expedition had been arranged by his uncle, Maurice Suckling. Suckling and Lutwidge knew each other well, Lutwidge having served under Suckling on a number of occasions, including time spent acting against privateers in 1771. Nelson was given the role of coxswain of Lutwidge's gig. Nelson managed to obtain command of the Carcasss cutter as the expedition progressed. =Nelson and the bear= By 1800 Lutwidge began to circulate a story that while the ship had been trapped in the ice, Nelson had seen and pursued a polar bear, before being ordered to return to the ship. Lutwidge's later version, in 1809, reported that Nelson and a companion had given chase to the bear, but on being questioned why, replied that \\"I wished, Sir, to get the skin for my father.\\" Nelson referred to Lutwidge as 'that good old man'. Later commands Lutwidge was appointed to command the 28-gun sixth rate in August 1775, and sailed to North America in March the following year. He played an active role in the American War of Independence, serving in the Saint Lawrence River between 1777 and 1778. On 10 April 1777 he was made commodore and commander- in-chief of the British naval forces on Lake Champlain by Guy Carleton. He led the naval forces pursuing the Americans who were retreating from the fall of Fort Ticonderoga in July that year. Lutwidge was replaced in his role on 4 October 1777 by Captain Samuel Graves. Returning to sea-going service he captured the American privateer Pompey on 13 June 1778. The Triton returned to Britain to be refitted and re-coppered in early 1779, after which she returned to North America, capturing the American privateer Gates on 29 September 1779. He was involved in the capture of a Spanish convoy on 8 January 1780, and on the night of 16 and 17 January Lutwidge was part of Admiral George Rodney's fleet against Juan de Lángara at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. His final duties with the Triton were to escort a convoy to Menorca and then to the Leeward Islands. Lutwidge then briefly took command of the 74-gun third rate and sailed her back to Britain with American prisoners of war, paying her off after her arrival in March. He was almost immediately posted to the new fifth rate , and commissioned her in March. By September he was back on the North American station, re-capturing the 20-gun on 29 July during his voyage across the Atlantic. The next two years were spent on the North American station, capturing a number of American privateers during this time, the General Green on 30 August 1781, the Raven on 1 April 1782 and the Diana on 29 August 1782. The Perseverance was paid off after the conclusion of the war. Lutwidge is next recorded as taking command of the third rate in November 1786, the Scipio then being a guard ship on the River Medway. In December 1792 he commissioned the new third rate . With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War he sailed in April 1793 to join the Mediterranean Fleet to join Admiral Samuel Hood. Flag rank and later life By 1797 he had been advanced to Vice- Admiral and in July that year he hoisted his flag aboard the second rate , in his post as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, before the Sandwich was paid off in September. Lutwidge moved his flag to the new guard ship, the third rate in October, shifting again to in 1799. He became a vice-admiral of the red on 14 February that year, and by 1799 he was commander of the fleets in the Downs, where under his command in 1801 was his former midshipman of the Carcass Horatio Nelson, by now in command of . Lutwidge was advanced to admiral of the blue on 1 January 1801, admiral of the white on 9 November 1805, and admiral of the red on 31 July 1810. He retired from active service and died at his estates at Holmrook on 16 August 1814, at the age of 78. A monument to his memory was raised in Irton, Cumbria parish church in the form of a stained glass window. He had married Catherine Harvey, but she predeceased him in 1810, and they had no children to succeed him. A distant relation was his great-nephew Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll. Skeffington Lutwidge's nephew, Major Charles Lutwidge, who sold the Holmrook estate to him, was the father of Carroll's mother Fanny.

With the fall of the Philippines to Imperial Japanese forces in April and May 1942, CAST personnel were evacuated to a newly established FRU at Melbourne, Australia, called FRUMEL (Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne). HYPO and FRUMEL supervised detached field units scattered at various locations and aboard ships throughout the south, central, and north Pacific areas until the end of World War II. A third center, NEGAT, was based at OP-20-G headquarters in Washington DC. The entire cryptanalysis effort conducted by the units was called Operation Magic. Liaison between the units and with the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB; the British signals intelligence center at Colombo, Ceylon in 1942) was titled Copek.

Vitrified tiles are often used outdoors due to their water and frost resistance. There are four types of Vitrified tiles - Soluble salt, Double charge, Full Body, Glazed. Process Vitrified tile is made by hydraulic pressing a mixture of clay, quartz, feldspar and silica, which make vitreous surface. Thus creating a single mass making them hard with low porosity. Different clay bodies reach vitrification at different temperatures. Types * Soluble salt vitrified tiles are screen printed and polished. http://www.morbiceramicindustry.com/vitrified-tiles.html * Double charge vitrified tiles are fed through a press that prints the pattern with a double layer of pigment, 3 to 4 mm thicker than other types of tile. This process does not permit complex patterns but results in a long-wearing tile surface, suitable for heavy traffic commercial projects. The design layer should not be more than 4mm thickness, which may weaken the strength of the tile. * Full body vitrified tiles have pigment in entire body (thickness) of the tile. This makes chips and scratches less noticeable and make this an ideal choice for high traffic zones, but the process significantly increases the cost. * Glazed vitrified tiles (GVT) have a glazed surface. They offer a wide variety of design, art work and surface textures like wood grain, bamboo, slate or stone.

Hyperfibrinolysis describes a situation with markedly enhanced fibrinolytic activity, resulting in increased, sometimes catastrophic bleeding. Hyperfibrinolysis can be caused by acquired or congenital reasons. Among the congenital conditions for hyperfibrinolysis, deficiency of alpha-2-antiplasmin (alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor) or plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) are very rare. The affected individuals show a hemophilia-like bleeding phenotype. Acquired hyperfibrinolysis is found in liver disease, in patients with severe trauma, during major surgical procedures, and other conditions. A special situation with temporarily enhanced fibrinolysis is thrombolytic therapy with drugs which activate plasminogen, e.g. for use in acute ischemic events or in patients with stroke. In patients with severe trauma, hyperfibrinolysis is associated with poor outcome. Moreover, hyperfibrinolysis may be associated with blood brain barrier impairment, a plasmin-dependent effect due to an increased generation of bradykinin. Bleeding is caused by the generation of fibrinogen degradation products which interfere with regular fibrin polymerization and inhibit platelet aggregation. Moreover, plasmin which is formed in excess in hyperfibrinolysis can proteolytically activate or inactivate many plasmatic or cellular proteins involved in hemostasis. Especially the degradation of fibrinogen, an essential protein for platelet aggregation and clot stability, may be a major cause for clinical bleeding. Diagnosis The diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis is made indirectly with immunochemical methods which detect the elevation of biomarkers such as D-Dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products), fibrinogen split products (FSP), complexes of plasmin and alpha-2-antiplasmin (PAP). However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods is limited because elevation of these biomarkers can also occur induced in other clinical conditions. The classical coagulation tests such as PT (prothrombin time), aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) or thrombin time are not very sensitive for hyperfibrinolysis, and influenced by numerous other variables. The euglobulin lysis time test is very time consuming and complex. Viscoelastic methods in whole blood, especially thromboelastometry (TEM) when performed with special reagents detect hyperfibrinolysis very sensitively in a functional approach. The APTEM test, a tissue factor activated, heparin insensitive test performed in the presence of aprotinin (fibrinolysis inhibitor, confirms hyperfibrinolysis by comparing the TEM result of this assay with the EXTEM test (same activator, but without aprotinin). A normalization or improvement of the TEMogram in APTEM versus EXTEM confirms hyperfibrinolysis. This in vitro approach can predict to a certain level if normal clot formation can be restored by use of an antifibrinolytic drug. Treatment Since the use of aprotinin has been abandoned due to major side effects, the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperfibrinolysis is made with synthetic drugs such as tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid or other lysine analogues. When used appropriately, antifibriolytic drugs may avoid unnecessary transfusions.
