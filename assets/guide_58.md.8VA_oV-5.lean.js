They were discovered in 1983 by archaeologists excavating tomb no. 247 at Mount Zhangjia () of Jiangling County, Hubei Province (near modern Jingzhou). The tomb was built for an early Western Han era official who had died in 186 BC. The texts were written on traditional bamboo slips connected by cords into rolled scrolls. The written works included legal case precedents, literature on medicine, mathematics, military strategy, and a calendar with dates ranging from 202 BC to 186 BC. The mathematical work found within the tomb, the Book on Numbers and Computation, rapidly advanced the state of the field of ancient Chinese mathematics studies, clarifying the obscure passages of the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Although its date roughly corresponds with the tomb occupant's death, one of the legal cases discussed in the work on law was dated 246 BC, with some even older legal precedents of the State of Qin mixed in, according to Mark Csikszentmihalyi.Csikszentmihalyi (2006), p. 29.

From 1982-2007, she was a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.  Education and career  In 1971, Bowerman earned her PhD in social psychology from Harvard University, where she studied under Roger Brown. She held positions at the University of Kansas from 1970 until 1982, when she joined the Max Planck Institute. Within the field of language acquisition, she specialized in the relationships between language and cognition, language and spatial representation, and language and event representation. Recurrent themes in her work included the relationship between conceptual development and language development, the use of cross-linguistic comparisons to disentangle what is universal and possibly innate from what is learned, the nature of children's early linguistic rules, and the potential of information about language acquisition to help decide among alternative theoretical approaches to language structure. Bowerman was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on 1 October 2011. A volume of papers in her honor, Routes to Language, was published by Psychology Press in 2015.

It commemorates, and allegedly marks the spot, of Jesus' reinstatement of Peter as chief among the Apostles. History The modern structure was built in 1933 and incorporates parts of an earlier 4th century church. At the base of its walls, opposite the main altar, foundations of the 4th century church are visible. In the 9th century, the church was referred to as the Place of the Coals. This name refers to the incident of Jesus' preparation of meal for the apostles, building a charcoal fire on which to cook the fish. Also first mentioned in the year 808 are the \\"Twelve Thrones\\", a series of heart shaped stones, which were placed along the shore to commemorate the Twelve Apostles. The church survived longer than any other in the area, finally being destroyed in 1263.Sacred Destinations The present Franciscan chapel was built on the site in 1933. This church was included in the itineraries of Popes Paul VI and John Paul II during their visits to Israel in 1964 and March 2000 respectively. Mensa Christi The church contains a projection of limestone rock in front of the present altar which is venerated as a \\"Mensa Christi\\", Latin for table of Christ. According to tradition this is the spot where Jesus is said to have laid out a breakfast of bread and fish for the Apostles, and told Peter to \\"Feed my sheep\\" after the miraculous catch, the third time he appeared to them after his resurrection. () It is disputed whether this table, or the one enshrined at the nearby Church of the Multiplication, is the one mentioned by the pilgrim Egeria in her narrative of the Holy Land circa 380. There is also another table of Christ enshrined at the Mensa Christi Church in Nazareth.

The Steerage is a black and white photograph taken by Alfred Stieglitz in 1907. It has been hailed as one of the greatest photographs of all time because it captures in a single image both a formative document of its time and one of the first works of artistic modernism. :\\"There were men and women and children on the lower deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading to the upper deck of the steerage, a small deck right on the bow with the steamer. :To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage deck there was fastened a gangway bridge that was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone. :On the upper deck, looking over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck‚Ä¶A round straw hat, the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railing made of circular chains ‚Äì white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape‚Ä¶I saw shapes related to each other. I was inspired by a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life.\\" Although Stieglitz described \\"an inclining funnel\\" in the scene photographs and models of the ship (see below) show that this object was actually a large mast to which booms were fastened for loading and unloading cargo. One of the booms is shown at the very top of the picture. Much has been written about the scene as a cultural document of an important period when many immigrants were coming to America. In fact, the picture was taken on a cruise to Europe from America, and for that reason some critics have interpreted it as recording people who were turned away by U.S. Immigration officials and were forced to go back home. Although some of the passengers might have been turned back because of failure to meet financial or health requirements for entrance, it is more likely that most of them were various artisans who worked in the booming construction trade of the time. Workers who were highly skilled in crafts such as cabinet-making, woodworking and marble laying were granted two-year temporary visas to complete their jobs and then returned to their homelands when the work was complete. Taking the photograph Kaiser Wilhelm II to take the photo. Shown on a model of the ship in the Deutsches Museum, Munich In June 1907 Stieglitz and his family sailed to Europe to visit relatives and friends. They booked passage on the SS Kaiser Wilhelm II, one of the largest and fastest ships in the world at that time. Stieglitz's wife Emmy insisted on first class accommodations, and the family had a fine stateroom on the upper decks. According to Stieglitz, sometime after their third day of travel he went for a walk around the ship and came upon a viewpoint that looked down toward the lower class passengers area, known on most ships as the steerage. Photography historian Beaumont Newhall wrote that it is likely the photo was taken while the ship was anchored at Plymouth, England, because the angle of the shadows indicates it was facing west, not east as it would have been while crossing the ocean. In addition there does not seem to be any sign of wind in the scene, which would have been ever present while the ship was moving. The scene Stieglitz saw is described above. He did not have his camera with him, and he raced back to his cabin to get it. At that time he was using a hand-held 4√ó5 Auto-Graflex that used glass plate negatives. Stieglitz found he had only one glass plate prepared at the time, and he quickly returned to the viewpoint and captured the one and only picture of the scene. He was not able to develop the plate until he arrived in Paris nearly a week later. He reported he went to the Eastman Kodak Company in Paris to use their darkroom but was referred to a local photographer instead. He went to the photographer's home and developed the plate there. The name of the photographer who lent his facility is unknown. Stieglitz offered to pay the photographer for the use of his darkroom and materials but he said the photographer told him, \\"I know who you are and it's an honor to have you in my darkroom.\\" Stieglitz kept the developed image in its original plate holder to protect it until he returned to New York several weeks later. Stieglitz later said he immediately recognized this image as \\"another milestone in photography‚Ä¶a step in my own evolution, a spontaneous discovery\\", but this claim is challenged by several of his biographers who have pointed out that although he had many opportunities to do so he did not publish it until 1911 and did not exhibit it until 1913. In addition, biographer Richard Whelan states, \\"If he really had known that he had just produced a masterpiece, he probably would not have been so depressed during his European vacation that summer [as he indicated in several letters to friends]\\". Whelan theorizes that when Stieglitz first looked at the negative he did not see the stylistic qualities he was then championing, and he set the negative aside while dealing with more pressing issues. In the period directly before and after taking The Steerage Stieglitz was still producing photos that were primarily pictorialist in style, and it would be several more years before he began to break with this tradition. The Steerage represents a \\"fundamental shift in Stieglitz's thinking\\", and, critics have said that while his mind had visualized the image when he took it he was not able to articulate his reasons for taking it until later. Also, painter Max Weber claims to have discovered the image while looking through Stieglitz's photos in 1910, and he took credit for first pointing out the aesthetic importance of the image. Whether that is true or not, it was only after Stieglitz began to seriously consider the works of modern American artists like John Marin, Arthur Dove and Weber that he finally published the image. Perhaps Stieglitz had seen the 1900 painting \\"In The Steerage\\" by George Luks (now in NC Museum of Art). Like the works of those artists,The Steerage is \\"divided, fragmented and flattened into an abstract, nearly cubistic design\\" and it has been cited as one of the first proto-Cubist works of art. One other distraction could have been a reason why Stieglitz did not immediately publish The Steerage. While he was still in Paris on the same trip he saw for the first time and experimented with the new Autochrome Lumi√®re process, the first commercially viable means of capturing images in color. For the next two years he was captivated by color photography, and he did not return to The Steerage and other black-and-white photos until he learned to photograph using this new process. First appearances Stieglitz first published The Steerage in the October 1911 issue of Camera Work, which he had devoted to his own photography. It appeared the following year on the cover of the magazine section of the Saturday Evening Mail (20 April 1912), a New York weekly magazine. It was first exhibited in a show of Stieglitz's photographs at \\"291\\" in 1913. In 1915 Stieglitz devoted the entire No 7-8 issue of 291 to The Steerage. The only text in the issue were comments on the photo by Paul Haviland and Marius de Zayas. Design and aesthetics There have been dozens of critical interpretations of The Steerage since it was first published. Here are some of the most prominent ones: *\\"This photographer is working in the same spirit as I am.\\" ‚Äì Pablo Picasso after having seen The Steerage *With The Steerage Stieglitz \\"abandoned the idea that photographs should bear some likeness to paintings and embarked on a new path to explore photos as photos in their own right.\\" *The Steerage dealt alternately with geometric forms constructed in spatial planes within a photographic frame and issues of social class and gender differences. *In The Steerage, Stieglitz \\"demonstrated that essentially 'documentary' photographs could convey transcendental truths and fully embody all of the principles by which any graphic image was deemed 'artistic'.\\" Versions According to the Key Set published by the National Gallery of Art there are five known versions of The Steerage: #A photogravure published in Camera Work, No 36 1911, plate 9 (Key Set #310). The image measures approximately 7‚Ä≥ √ó 5‚Ä≥ (19.5 √ó 15.1 cm). #A photogravure identified as a proof of the image published in Camera Work (Key Set #311). The image measures approximately 7‚Ä≥ √ó 6‚Ä≥ (19.7 √ó 15.8 cm). #A photogravure exhibited in several exhibitions of Stieglitz's work (Key Set #312). The image measures approximately 13‚Ä≥ √ó 10‚Ä≥ (33.2 √ó 26.4 cm). #A photogravure published on Japanese paper as an insert in the deluxe edition of the September‚ÄìOctober 1915 issue of 291 (Key Set #313). The image measures approximately 13‚Ä≥ √ó 10‚Ä≥ (33.3 √ó 26.6 cm). A copy of this version sold at auction in October 2008 for US$110,500. #A gelatin silver photograph printed by Stieglitz sometime in the late 1920s or early 1930s (Key Set #314). The image measures approximately 4‚Ä≥ √ó 3‚Ä≥ (11.3 √ó 9.2 cm). Several copies are known to exist of each version. Most are in major museums. Other prints with slightly different measurements are likely to be one of the five versions listed above. Image sizes may vary slightly from one copy to another due to paper shrinkage.

After other functions, among which chief of the Nederlandsche Handelmaatschappij, he became head of secretary in Saint Petersburg and later in London. The primary reason of William II to get him to the Netherlands and have him be appointed as Prime Minister of the Netherlands was to keep Thorbecke out of the Council of Ministers. In March 1848 he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers, holding the ministerial offices of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance. His proposal to design a Constitution following British model, which would imply that the Senate could not be dissolved by the King, was rejected by the other ministers.

The episode was written by Henry Alonso Myers and directed by Lee Shallat-Chemel. Plot In the wake of Ignacio's recent heart attack, in which he is now recuperating from home after having quadruple-bypass surgery, Betty, Hilda and Justin end up trying to cater to his every whim. Hilda and Betty agree to work out a deal to help out with Ignacio's medical appointments. Afterward, Betty returns to her apartment, where she discovers Amanda is worried about her, but at the same time discovers that her place needs work. Not only that, at work her desk is filled with assignments and letters. As she starts trying to make up for two weeks of lost work, Daniel and Claire asked her about how her dad was doing, with Claire recommending a doctor to Betty that Ignacio can see at a hospital so he can if is in perfect condition. Betty takes the offer and agrees to stay with him for the next four hours and assures Hilda that she is on top of things. Meanwhile, Daniel, Molly, Connor and Wilhelmina try to conceal their escalating love connections, with Daniel and Molly spending the time in St. Barth's while Wilhelmina and Connor spending the time in the Swiss Alps. The relationship between the latter has begun to take its toll on Marc, who finds himself in the middle of their secret affair, especially when he was stuck entertaining a client. This puts Marc in an awkward situation as he ends up taking over the job to cover for Wilhelmina while she and Conner had their tryst, leading to Wilhelmina dismissing Marc from the meeting after she berates him for doing her job. However hours later she has a change of heart as Marc expresses his true feelings about doing her work that she neglected, as the following day she trusts Marc on entertaining another client while she goes off to have lunch with a potential prospect. At the same time, Betty gets a call from Daniel after he learns that one of the letters featuring Daniel and Molly were sent to Suzuki St. Pierre and when Daniel learns of this, Betty skips out of the hospital to stop him from using it on Fashion Buzz. After getting the info from an \\"ex-boyfriend\\" of Suzuki's who works at Mode, Daniel and Betty head to New Jersey, where they discover the truth about Suzuki: his real name is Byron Wu, and he is a straight guy who is married with two sons. Afterward, Byron agrees not to use the photos as they promise to keep his secret. However, the photo featuring Molly holding hands with Daniel did end up in the newspaper with Daniel cut out; Connor later spots it, giving him suspicion to find out whose hand she is holding. Back at the hospital, Betty learns that Ignacio is missing and ends up telling Hilda what happened. As the two return to the hospital, they learn that their father's test results came back negative, but outside the hospital the two started arguing over who should be responsible for looking out for Ignacio. Later that evening at home, Ignacio has to settle the situation by hiring a nurse thanks to his Medicaid coverage, thus upsetting the two. Later that evening, after seeing Amanda looking over the bills, Betty decides that it was time to move out of the apartment so she can return to help out the family.

The river's catchment area is almost twice the size of the Taw's catchment area above the confluence, but has significantly lower rainfall than the upper Taw valley. The river was earlier called the Nymet, thought to be a Celtic word meaning 'shrine'. Several Nymet place-names remain in the area, including Nymet Tracey and Nymet Rowland, and it seems that the area may have been sacred in Celtic times.Gelling M.

The Type 276 only saw light at the end of 1944 and never went into mass production. Differences Apart from having a standard Wehrmacht tow- hook fitted to the rear cross-body member, the Typ276 differed from the standard Typ82 on the following points: =Suspension and tyres= On the first model, the rear suspension was strengthened, and the car shod with bigger tyres (BF 200C16) on 7.00C16 rims (with a smaller offset inwards: 13 mm. instead of 33 mm). These were the same tyres and rims fitted on the Typ166 'Schwimmwagen'. =Gearing= To improve traction which proved to be grossly inadequate when towing off-road, these Typ276 were later fitted with different gears in the rear axle reduction boxes (14:29 = 1:2.07 instead of 15:21 = 1:1.4); this increased the ground clearance by 15 mm (19/32\\") at the rear, brought the top speed down from 80 km/h (50 mph) to 54 km/h (34 mph) at an engine speed of 3300 rpm, and lowered the rated mileage to 6.35 l/100km (37 mpg) on the road. =Governor= To prevent over-revving, especially when driving without a gun or trailer, the engine was fitted with a governor on the generator shaft (as fitted on the Typ155 stationary engine). =Drawbar pull= With these modifications, the drawbar pull reached, on tarmac, 700 kg (1550 lb) when starting from a stand, and 500 kg (1100 lb) at a speed of 8 km/h (5 mph) and the Type 276 would create a drawbar pull of about 550‚Äì650 kg (1210‚Äì50 lb) at top speed (of course this is not to be confused with the actual towing capacity, which is much greater; the drawbar pull is a rating of torque, and indicates the weight which the vehicle could theoretically lift straight off of the ground. A vehicle with a drawbar pull of 500kg could easily tow a trailer weighing 2,000kg or much more). References Notes  Bibliography = * .

Short biography of Dunn Biography Dunn was born in Wylam, Northumberland. His father was Matthias Dunn, a mining engineer and manager and one of the first Government Inspectors of Mines for the North East of England. Archibald Dunn was educated at Ushaw College and Stonyhurst College. He then went to Bristol to be apprenticed to architect Charles Francis Hansom, the younger brother of Joseph Aloysius Hansom, the inventor of the Hansom cab and founder of The Builder. It was here that Dunn met his future partner Edward Joseph Hansom, the son of his employer. Their principal works in North East England include the tower and spire of St Mary‚Äôs Cathedral in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the church of St. Michael in Elswick, Tyne and Wear. Dunn was also a prominent local landowner. Across the valley from Prudhoe is Castle Hill House (1878‚Äì9), which he designed and built as his own home in Wylam. Previously he had lived in Gateshead, where he was an Alderman, Mayor and a Justice of the Peace for County Durham. In 1870 Dunn was President of the Northern Architectural Association. In 1862 Dunn married Sara Armstrong, an author. They both enjoyed travel, and in 1886 Dunn published a book entitled Notes and Sketches of an Architect, which was a collection of sketches made in France, Germany, Spain and England. Dunn's son, Archibald Manuel Dunn, was taken into partnership of the firm in 1887, and it became Dunn, Hansom & Dunn. In 1894, W. Ellison Fenwicke also became a partner in the firm. In 1903, the younger Dunn withdrew. Fenwicke continued to run the firm with various partners and under various styles, the final practice being Dunn Hansom & Fenwicke although Fenwicke by then was the only active partner. Dunn retired between 1883 and 1887.Dunn & Hansom Architectural Practice from ScottishArchitects.org.uk, retrieved 27 December 2015 In 1901 the Dunns moved to Wood House, Branksome Park, in Bournemouth, where he died on 17 January 1917 aged 85.

Currently, Herbal Magic operates as an online store and weight loss system administered via telephone and email counseling with its clients. The program includes one-on-one personal coaching, natural health products (including vitamin support) and grocery store bought food.  History  Herbal Magic was founded in 1995 by Dieter Decker, who opened his first weight loss and nutrition centre in London, Ontario. After growing the business to 228 centres nationwide (220 in Canada, and 8 under the name Nutri Magic in Michigan), Decker sold the company in December 2003 to Trivest, a Miami, Florida based private investment firm. Trivest appointed Tom McNeely of Tim Hortons as CEO, and the number of units grew by nearly 45%, to 300 stores. In the summer of 2006, Trivest hired CIBC World Markets to launch an auction of Herbal Magic. According to one source, the company was sold earlier than normal because the investment had \\"already exceeded all of Trivest's expectations.\\" In October 2006, Herbal Magic was sold to TorQuest Partners. Then in 2009, Cameron Capital, a Toronto-based firm whose investments include Hair Club for Men and Beauty First, invested in the business. On February 18, 2009, the company announced a change in ownership making new investments in Herbal Magic Inc., including a personal investment from incoming Chairman Steve Hudson. The principles of Cameron Capital became managing partners of Herbal Magic, overseeing both strategic and daily operations. On August 7, 2015, the company declared bankruptcy and closed all of its central and eastern Canada stores. Its 41 western Canada stores were taken over by a secured lender, but eventually closed in 2016.  Program  The Herbal Magic program offers a combination of private one-on-one personal coaching, real food bought at your grocery store, and natural health products. It has weight loss programs designed for women, men, diabetics (type I and II), youth, women who are planning to conceive, breastfeeding mothers, and those with diagnosed heart conditions. The programs are designed to help clients lose weight at an average rate of two pounds per week. There are three key phases to the program including: * Phase 1: Weight Loss. During this phase, a personal health coach reviews the client's medical history and food journal as well as recommends a meal plan with natural health products to optimize healthy weight loss. Once the goal weight is reached, the client enters Phase 2. * Phase 2: Stabilization. In this phase, the client and personal health coach work together to increase the amount of food intake while maintaining the client's goal weight. * Phase 3: Maintenance. The length of the maintenance phase varies for clients based on the amount of weight lost during the weight loss phase. This is the phase intended to ensure the weight is kept off for good.  Products  Herbal Magic's Scientific Advisory Team researches and designs all of the products and programs. Developed by a team of pharmacological manufacturing companies, naturopathic doctors, registered dietitians, and pharmacists, Herbal Magic natural health products are designed to support weight control and promote overall health and energy. The products consist of herbs, nutraceuticals, vitamins, and minerals. As of July 2012, all 46 of Herbal Magic's Natural Health Products have received Natural Product Numbers (NPNs) which means that they are licensed for sale in Canada and have had their safety, efficacy, and quality approved by Health Canada.  Criticism  The February 5, 2010 episode of the investigative news program CBC Marketplace examined the health effects of Herbal Magic's optional supplement products. The program and its independent experts determined there was insufficient empirical evidence to convince them that the supplements facilitate weight loss. Accordingly, the documentary claimed it observed Herbal Magic salespeople using tactics that lead customers to overestimate the supplements' effectiveness. Marketplace also interpreted Herbal Magic's practice of only telling customers the cost of the program after a free consultation as disingenuous.  Advertising  In September 2008, Herbal Magic began its first national advertising campaign. The initiative, aimed primarily at women, consisted of television, print and online advertising. The advertisements encouraged women to rediscover a sense of self. The most recent campaign, launched in February 2010, focuses on real clients who have lost weight, and kept it off, including Susan Crenshaw. Crenshaw was the former TV host of HGTV's This Small Space. Spokespersons for the program have included former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps, former Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager Gord Stellick and Canadian figure skater Elizabeth Manley who, since 2009, has waged a highly publicized battle with her weight. The Herbal Magic program brought Manley within 5 lbs of her Calgary ‚Äô88 Olympic weight when she won the silver medal. =2010 Weight Loss Cup= From July to October 2010 Herbal Magic and the Canadian Football League co-sponsored a highly publicized Weight Loss Cup. Eight Canadian Football League alumni engaged in an amiable 20-week competition to lose weight and adopt a healthier lifestyle, using the Herbal Magic program. They included Gerry Dattilio of the Calgary Stampeders, Ralph Scholz of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Chris Walby of the Blue Bombers, Gerald Roper of the BC Lions, Eric Upton of the Edmonton Eskimos, Andre Greene of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Doug Smith of the Montreal Alouettes, and Paul Markle of the Toronto Argonauts. Gerry Dattilio achieved the most points and was crowned the Weight Loss Cup Champion. Fans could vote online for their favourite player. Besides weekly prizes for voting, voters could win a grand prize of a trip for two to the Grey Cup.

The album was finally released on September 22, 1998. Scott Hull remastered the album at Visceral Sound for a compilation with the EP A String of Lies which was released on October 11, 2005. The album was generally well received. It was given a 4.5 out of 5 by William York from Allmusic, who called it \\"the band's strongest effort to date.\\" It made Rolling Stone call Soilent Green one of the \\"ten most important hard and heavy bands right now\\" and was 18th on Terrorizer's top albums of 1998. Music and artwork The record features Soilent Green's mixture of grindcore and sludge metal. According to William York from Allmusic, \\"each song is a nonstop sequence of constantly morphing riffs and assaultive, split-personality vocals, leaving listeners little chance to catch their breaths.\\" Throughout, frontman Ben Falgoust alternates between black metal screams, a hardcore- derived, semi-barking voice; spoken word passages and death growls. According to York, \\"his varied vocals, together with his sadistic lyrics, make for a frightening and intense presence.\\" During the album the band uses Southern- flavored rock grooves, blast beats, moments very complex musically and Black Sabbath-inspired riffs. There are a few quiet moments, like the intros on \\"Build Fear\\" and \\"Her Unsober Ways.\\" Although not credited, Phil Anselmo provided backing vocals on the album. He is given thanks in the liner notes. The cover of the album is based on a picture by Alfons Mucha.

Production has steadily increased over the years, rising from 5.4 million tonnes in 1997 to almost 7 million tonnes in 2007.Statistics from FAOSTAT -- Production quantities in tonnes of bananas: 5412360 (1997), 5322200 (1998), 5478350 (1999), 5663360 (2000), 6176960 (2001), 6422860 (2002), 6800981 (2003), 6583564 (2004), 6703400 (2005), 6956179 (2006), 6972408 (2007). In 2000, Brazil was fourth, behind India, Uganda and Ecuador, in banana production. By 2006, Brazil became the second largest banana-producer, behind only India, followed by China, Ecuador and the Philippines. Most of the bananas produced are consumed domestically. Gross exports has increased from 12.5 thousand tonnes in 1995 to more than 220 thousand tonnes in 2002 and 2003, mostly to neighbours Argentina and Uruguay, but these figures are still far behind industry leaders such as Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Philippines and Colombia which export more than a million tonnes of bananas annually. Brazil produces and consumes Cavendish, apple and fruit bananas and the main producer in Brazil is in the southeastern state of S√£o Paulo with 16.4% of the Brazilian market, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Other notable areas where bananas in Brazil are cultivated include Prata in North-East Brazil; Belo Horizonte, Vitoria, Rio de Janeiro and Florian√≥polis in the southern and south-eastern regions. As of 2004, 6.6 million tons of bananas were produced, with a turnover of a little in excess US$ 1 billion. Genetic research into banana production and scientific studies is helping to maximise output and quality, in addition to increasing resistance to disease increasingly as the country is developing. A Banana Genome program and a genetic data bank, the DataMusa, is in place institutionally in Brazil to monitor and conduct research. The data bank has 40,000 sequences of DNA and another 5,000 genes and under surveillance of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) in Brazil. In Brazil, 20 scholars and researchers are working on the program, including ongoing collaboration in research into bananas with the Catholic University of Bras√≠lia (UCB) and with the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development (Cirad). Notably the programme has done much since 2002 to curtail the effects of the black sigatoka which previously caused widespread disaster to banana plantations in the Amazon. The Brazilian Banana Genome program is also supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) internationally with support from experts in countries such as France and Belgium, UK, Japan and the Czech Republic. Apart from molecular genomics research, Embrapa also has a successful banana breeding program, generating disease-resistant varieties, such as the Pacovan Ken. Pacovan Ken, a banana breed resistant to yellow and black sigatoka and to Panama disease launched in November 2001 as a national crop plant in Brazil, is named after Embrapa scientist Kenneth Shepherd.

This type of setup is more commonly associated with non-commercial educational broadcasting; educational state networks (or \\"member networks\\"), which generally involve member stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), are common in many states where most of the cities are not large enough to support a standalone non-commercial station. Commercially licensed state networks that transmit programming from one of the major commercial broadcast networks (and in most cases, since shortly before the digital television transition, any multicast services carried by the originating station) exist mainly in markets covering large swaths of territory. The local affiliates in these markets usually require at least three full-power stations to adequately cover the market. Under U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, the parent station in a commercial state network and all of its satellites are counted together as one station, rather than individual stations. Background The groundwork of the first state network in the United States was laid in 1953, when Alabama Governor Gordon Persons pushed the Alabama State Legislature to pass legislation to establish the Alabama Educational Television Commission, wanting to ensure that the entire state would receive educational programming. Persons was well aware that much of Alabama was still very rural ‚Äì outside of the state's three largest cities, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile ‚Äì and therefore, was too thinly populated to support multiple standalone educational television stations. The bill used to form the Commission did not include any state funding, however the Alabama State Docks donated $50,000 as initial support. After the Commission was formed, it requested construction permits from the FCC to build broadcasting facilities for four television stations, all of which would air the same programming throughout their broadcast day fed from a central studio in Birmingham. On January 7, 1955, WTIQ (channel 7) in Talladega, Alabama signed on as the nation's ninth non-commercial educational television station. Then on April 28, the AETC signed on WBIQ (channel 10) in Birmingham. This was the beginning of Alabama Educational Television (renamed the Alabama Public Television Network in the 1960s and shortened to Alabama Public Television in 1988), the first operational educational television network. It made its first broadcast as a network shortly after WBIQ signed on. Seven other transmitters were added to the APT network, eventually providing educational programming to 98% of the state. Each of the stations would use microwave towers to transmit their signals across a span of roughly throughout the state, adapting transmission methods originally used by the Australian postal system for communications purposes to distribute programming from each transmitter tower. Since then, 25 other states have started public television networks, all based on Alabama's model. The Badger Television Network, which debuted in January 1958 on three Wisconsin television stations that were primary affiliates of ABC ‚Äì WISN-TV (channel 12) in Milwaukee, WFRV- TV (channel 5, now a CBS affiliate) in Green Bay and WKOW-TV (channel 27) in Madison ‚Äì used a model different from other state networks, intending to mirror a traditional television network by pooling simultaneous programming among its otherwise separately programmed stations (with the Milwaukee studios of WISN-TV serving as the production center of three of its programs). The Badger network ceased operations after only eight months, existing until August 8, 1958. In 1959, NBC affiliate KCKT in Great Bend, Kansas, signed on a satellite station, KGLD (channel 11) in Garden City, forming the two-station \\"Tri-Circle Network\\". They were joined in 1959 by KOMC-TV (channel 8) in Oberlin, resulting in the creation of the first true commercial state network. Then in 1962, the Federal Communications Commission collapsed central and western Kansas into the Wichita-Hutchinson market. This created the largest television market in terms of land mass in the United States, stretching across 70 counties in Kansas and far southern Nebraska. KCKT's owner, Central Kansas Television, then purchased Wichita's KARD-TV (channel 3) and combined it with its existing three-station network. The new group was known as the \\"Kansas State Network,\\" based at KARD. To help its viewers think of its four stations as part of one large network, in 1983, KARD changed its call letters to KSNW and had its repeaters adopt similar call letters under the \\"KSN\\" structure (KOMC changed its calls to KSNK, KCKT changed theirs to KSNC and KGLD became KSNG). Two other stations, KTSB (channel 27) in the state capital of Topeka and KTVJ (channel 16) in Joplin, Missouri joined the network as partial satellites not long after, and changed their respective callsigns to KSNT and KSNF. In the early 1990s, then-owners SJL Communications ended KSNT and KSNF's microwave link to KSNW due to the monetary expense, and began maintaining their own programming schedules (even so, both stations retain callsigns bearing the \\"KSN\\" name, while KSNF continued to brand itself as \\"KSN16,\\" before amending it to \\"KSN\\" in 2007). The three other major network affiliates in the Wichita-Hutchinson market (KWCH-TV (channel 12), KAKE (channel 10) and KSAS-TV (channel 24)) eventually launched their own relay networks to cover the market. On December 21, 2018, WDAY-TV in Fargo, North Dakota became a statewide and regional network of ABC affiliates for North Dakota, northwestern Minnesota, eastern Montana, and southern Manitoba, Canada, as WDAZ-TV ended local newscasts broadcasting from Grand Forks, North Dakota to become a simulcast of WDAY-TV. Often, repeater stations of a commercial state network will place local news inserts over some portions of local newscasts aired by the parent station. For years, many of them aired separate full-fledged newscasts of their own, though due to budget concerns this has become less common. Additionally, the repeaters usually air separate local advertising from that broadcast by the parent station. Some state networks use callsigns that differ by only one letter between stations. Alabama Public Television's stations utilitz WxIQ (where x is letters A through I) as their callsign structure, while UNC-TV stations in North Carolina use WUNx (where x is a letter that is random, or is relevant to a location in its broadcast range).

History  Peacemaker sails toward the Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge on her journey into the Port of Green Bay and past the Grassy Island Range Lights. Peacemaker, originally named Avany, was built on a riverbank in southern Brazil using traditional methods and tropical hardwoods, and was launched in 1989. The original owner and his family motored in the southern Atlantic Ocean before bringing the ship up through the Caribbean to Savannah, Georgia, where they intended to rig it as a three-masted staysail Marconi rigged motor sailer. The work was never done, however, and in the summer of 2000, she was purchased by the Twelve Tribes, a religious group with 50 or so communities in North and South America, Europe, and Australia. They spent the next seven years replacing all of the ship‚Äôs mechanical and electrical systems and rigging her as a barquentine. The refit vessel set sail for the first time in the spring of 2007, under the name Peacemaker.  Purpose  Peacemaker is used to travel between the communities of the Twelve Tribes while providing an apprenticeship program for their youth in sailing, seamanship, navigation, and boat maintenance. The ship has a United States Coast Guard attraction vessel permit and is available for festivals and dockside hospitality events.  Features  Peacemaker has a large deckhouse and spacious cabins finished in mahogany, modeled after the interior of Cutty Sark. She also has an innovative transom that can be lowered while in port to reveal a watertight bulkhead with two large doors opening into a cargo area and fully equipped workshop.  Present day  In 2013, Peacemaker participated in the Tall Ships 1812 Tour, a pan-provincial event that traveled throughout Ontario during the summer of 2013, commemorating the bicentennial of the War of 1812.

Robert Sr. arrived in the United States from Liverpool, England in May 1908. Siblings were Robert Arbib, Jr. (March 17, 1915 in New York - July 1987 in New York) and John A. Arbib (born September 1924 in New York). Richard Arbib was married to Audrey Schulz and they were divorced in 1952 in Volusia County, Florida. Audrey later married Associated Press photographer Baron Hans Ferdinand von Nolde (born Berlin, Germany, died November 9, 2002 at 77 years of age). Richard later married Helen W. He dated model Bettie Page in the 1950s. Career In the 1950s, Arbib painted two covers for Galaxy Science Fiction The second illustrated a novelette by Robert A. Heinlein Arbib graduated from the Pratt Institute in New York City in 1939 . He worked as a designer for the Henney Motor Company of Freeport, Illinois, a manufacturer of professional car bodies such as ambulances, hearses and limosines. Henney was Packard's sole professional body supplier. He started his automotive design career consulting with Harley Earl at GM Styling in the late 1930s. He came to the attention of Henney after serving in World War II. He was responsible for the design of the commercial line of Packard built by Henney from 1951 to 1954. One of the distinctive features of these models was wrap-around rear side windows. Arbib designed the Packard show car Pan American for the International Motor Sports Show held in New York City at the Grand Central Palace on March 29, 1952. It was based upon a 1951 Packard 250 convertible and built by Henney. The Pan American won the first-place trophy for most outstanding design at the show. Arbib's clients included Argus, Benrus, General Motors, International Nickel, Republic Aviation, Simca, Swank Jewelry, Tidewater Oil, Union Pacific, American Type Founders, and U.S. Rubber. In 1955, Arbib was hired by American Motors Corporation (AMC) to create a unique look for the Hudson line that was to share the senior 1955 Nash body. His main design theme was to use a \\"V\\" form throughout the car, which he dubbed V-Line styling. The design was to correspond with AMC starting to build its own V8 engines to replace the Packard V8 it was using in its Hudson and Nash models. He also designed, and Andrew Mazzara built, the Astra-Gnome \\"Time and Space Car\\" concept car that included a \\"celestial time-zone clock permitting actual flight-type navigation.\\" The design was influenced by space travel forms.\\"Arbib Company\\", p. 48. The vehicle was based on the Nash Metropolitan and was Arbib's vision of what an automobile would look like in the year 2000. The Astra-Gnome attracted attention at the 1956 International Automobile Show in New York, and was also featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine's September 3, 1956 issue. He designed asymmetrical cases for the new Hamilton electric watches in the 1950s, including such notable models as the Ventura, Everest, and Pacer. He also designed watches for Tourneau, Benrus, Sheffield and Gucci. He designed boats for the Century Boat Company in the 1950s, notably one of their most successful and expensive models, the Coronado, as well as the Arabian model.

It is published and distributed by Carmel Publishing House, Jerusalem. Katharsis was established in 2004 by Mezaref, a non-profit-making society registered in Israel. The first editors were John Glucker, Doron Mendels, and Moshe Shokeid. Each issue opens - following the table of contents and editorial - by a 'programmatic' article criticizing some aspect of the manner in which study and research in the human disciplines are conducted in the Israeli academic world. Most of the main articles are 'review articles', dealing at length and in depth with books and articles in the Humanities and Social Studies published in Hebrew. The reviewers, experts in their respective fields, analyse in detail the book or article under review, citing exemplary passages for discussion, and deal with the methods (or lack of them) employed (or ignored) by the authors. The main aim of Katharsis is to raise academic standards by exposing errors, distortions and wilful deceptions in sub- standard publications; but some of the reviews praise works of serious scholarship and hold them up as examples to be followed. Each issue ends with the section Remembrance of Former Generations, which includes a critical article or two by one of the leading Israeli scholars of the past century, preceded by a survey of his life and an assessment of his contributions to knowledge. Each issue also has a number of short, 1-2 page, 'pearls': quotations from books or articles pretending to present the reader with proper facts and explanations, while being full of basic errors. The editors explain what the errors are and what should have been written instead. At the back of each volume there is an English title-page, and English summaries of the main articles. The present editors are Yehuda Friedlander, John Glucker, Alon Harel, Doron Mendels, and Amos Edelheit.

History Due to increased Allied pressure on the German war effort, Nazi Germany had grown desperate for new soldiers to continue the war effort, and one way to mitigate the massive losses was to increase the combative power of the remaining soldiers in the Wehrmacht. Though simpler drugs such as Pervitin and Isophan helped to keep soldiers properly stimulated, Vice Admiral Hellmuth Heye in March 1944 requested a drug that could also provide the users with superhuman strength and a boosted sense of self-esteem. Pharmacologist Gerhard Orzechowski and a group of other researchers were commissioned in Kiel to develop this drug, and by later in the year developed a formula which contained in each tablet: 5 mg of oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of cocaine, and 3 mg of methamphetamine (then called Pervitin, now available under the brand name Desoxyn).Paterson, Lawrence (2006).

Career  Rivard holds a certificate in administrative sciences from Laval University. Throughout the 1970s he held various managerial positions in the Quebec business world. From 1980 to 1984 he was mayor of Beauport, and from 1985 to 1988 he was director of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. From 1991 to 1994 he served on the executive committee of the Society of Economic Development for the Region of Quebec. In the 1994 Quebec election, Rivard ran in the riding of Limoilou representing the Parti Qu√©b√©cois and was elected. He served in various backbench roles in the PQ government, including as Assistant to the Minister responsible for the Quebec region (from January 19, 1996 to October 28, 1998). As a PQ member he campaigned for Quebec sovereignty during the 1995 Quebec referendum. In the 1998 election, Rivard lost his seat to Liberal candidate Michel Despr√©s. In the 2000 Canadian federal election, he attempted a political comeback running in the riding of Qu√©bec under the banner of the Canadian Alliance, a considerable departure from his previous political affiliation. He lost to Bloc Qu√©b√©cois candidate Christiane Gagnon. In December 2008 he was appointed to the Senate of Canada as a Conservative by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. After being shut out of the 2015 federal election campaign, he quit the Tory caucus to sit as an independent.

Lewis, In Brazil, Farmers Ripping Out Orange Trees, Wall Street Journal (June 13, 2013).  History  The orange was introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese around 1530.Foreign Agriculture Report: Citrus Industry of Chile, U.S. Foreign Agricultural Service (1958), p. 3.  Production  According to the statistical database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 702,200 hectares of oranges were harvested in 2013; this is down from 836,041 hectares in 2003.FAOSTAT database search. Brazil is also the world's largest exporter of orange juice. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the country shipped 1.2 million metric tons of orange juice in 2012‚Äîtwelve times more than the United States, the world's 2nd-largest exporter. In 2013, it was reported that many Brazilian orange-growers were giving up on oranges and other citrus fruits and turning instead to sugarcane and other crops. Brazilian orange-growers have been pushed out of the market because of a decline in domestic prices of oranges, as well as rising costs of labor and chemicals. One reason for low prices in 2013 was consecutive bumper crops in Brazil during the two previous growing seasons, which increased global supply and led to a 31% decline in world market prices. The state of S√£o Paulo is the biggest producer in Brazil. The number of fruit-bearing orange trees there fell 8.3% to 185.5 million in 2012. Three Brazilian companies dominate the orange-juice export market: Citrosuco SA Agroind√∫stria, Sucocitrico Cutrale Ltda, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities Brasil SA. Together, these companies account for about 40% of Brazilian orange production and 98% of Brazilian juice exports. The domination of the market by these three companies is also blamed for the low orange prices. According to the Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics at the University of S√£o Paulo, the average price per box of oranges offered by industrial buyers in Brazil fell almost 60% from January 2007 to May 2013, from 15.46 Brazilian reals to 6.50 Brazilian reals.  Human rights violations  A recurrent issue in agricultural large-scale production are human rights violations, in which the orange sector has been involved as well. In 2015 for example, the German NGO Christliche Initiative Romero and Austrian NGO Global 2000 reported that workerson a plantation in Brazil supplying orange juice giant Cutrale had not been paid for several weeks. Furthermore, the debts of the workers were increasing daily due to the high costs they were being charged for transport to the plantation, accommoda- tion and food, which was provided by the local labour contrac-tor at extortionate prices. The workers were thus unable to leavethe plantation as they were heavily indebted to the contractorand could not afford the bus journey back home. The authors of the report call this a modern system of slav-ery and they are not alone in doing so. The Brazilian Ministry of Labour and Employment itself has put Cutrale on their ‚Äúdirty list‚Äù of slave labour. Brazil launched an anti-slavery strategy in the mid-1990s and since then authorities have been carrying out raids and engaging in a ‚Äúname-and-shame‚Äù strategy towards companies that have been found to be engaged in slave labour. Prosecutors in the state of S√£o Paulo say they have investigated Cutrale‚Äôs labour practices 286 times over the past decade, compared to 71 times for Louis Dreyfus Company and 50 times for Citrosuco the other two big orange juice traders. Some probes have also resulted inlawsuits and others in settlements. For example, in March 2014 a tribunal ordered Cutrale and two other companies to pay 113 million reais (USD 43 million) in penalties and to stop irregular subcontracting of orange pickers.

Gurklis (March 16, 1918 - October 31, 2008) was a member of the Order of the Marians of the Immaculate Conception and a noted mathematics teacher at Marianapolis Preparatory School. Early life Albin J. Gurklis was born on March 16, 1918, to Dominick and Barbara Gurklis in a small home in Waterbury, Connecticut. When asked about his youth, Father Gurklis would reply that he \\"was small and not very good at math\\". Born into a Lithuanian family, he acquired his native tongue, speaking it along with American English. College Young Albin entered the novitiate and was ordained a priest at Marianapolis College, now Marianapolis Preparatory School on August 8, 1943. After being admitted to the order of the Marians of the Immaculate Conception, Father Gurklis completed his fourth year of theology at Marianapolis. He then proceeded to the Marian Hills Seminary in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, to complete his training. Father Gurklis, now with the title M.I.C., was admitted to Marquette University in Wisconsin to continue his studies in the area of mathematics attaining an M.S. in Mathematics in 1950 while completing a thesis paper on the Hexagramma Mysticum. Marianapolis years After a brief period of ministry at Marian parishes across the US, Father Gurklis returned to his alma mater Marianapolis to teach his favorite subject: mathematics. Father Gurklis, affectionately known as \\"Father Gurks\\" or simply \\"Gurks\\" was a familiar sight on Marianapolis campus for the next 58 years. He taught Algebra I, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, Geometry, and Calculus, and even held the position of department chair for several years. During those 58 years he taught over 2000 students and worked to make Marianapolis an environment which promoted \\"clear, rational thinking\\". He also served as Assistant Headmaster at Marianapolis as well as dorm prefect and house secretary. Father Gurklis had the ability to teach with his eyes partially closed in order to \\"see\\" the answer to the problem and by his early 70s was able to recite his lesson plans from memory, with the inclusion of blackboard examples. In January 2008, he retired at the age of 90 due to eye complications, bidding a solemn farewell to his educational career. However, Father Gurklis did not leave without a farewell party, which celebrated his accomplishments. During the ceremony, the faculty introduced the Father Gurklis Mathematics Award, intended to honor exemplary success in mathematics at Marianapolis.http://boards.ancestry.com/topics.obits2/23636/mb.ashx?pnt=1 Father Gurks was very proud of the achievements of his former students and certainly appreciated their visits after graduation. When asked one time about how he could remember so many former students, he replied ‚ÄúI never forget a student!‚Äù. Many Marinapolis graduates who have gone on to science and engineering careers credit Father Gurks with having given them the skills required to succeed in challenging college math courses.http://boards.ancestry.com/topics.obits2/23636/mb.ashx?pnt=1 Lithuanian community Despite his work at Marianapolis, Father Gurklis was able to allocate time to the ministry of his fellow Lithuanians by celebrating masses in Lithuanian at the Holy Trinity Church in Hartford, Connecticut. In addition, he also assisted the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception in Putnam, Connecticut and provided ministry work to Lithuanian-American communities all throughout Connecticut. Death Father Gurklis suffered a massive heart attack on the night of October 30, 2008, and died a few hours later on the morning of Halloween. The following days saw a mass mourning at Marianapolis for the death of a beloved priest and teacher. Marians from all over the world came to pay their respects at Marianapolis and at Father Gurklis' funeral at the Eden Hill National Shrine of Divine Mercy. During the services Very Rev. Dan Cambra, MIC stated \\" we are dust, and unto dust we shall return \\" fulfilling Father Gurklis' belief that \\"it is what we do in life which makes us great\\". Father Gurklis is buried at the Marian cemetery in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.http://www.marian.org/marians/story.php?NID=3408 Famous quotes Father Gurklis possessed strong moral values and laws to which he lived his life by. This life-advice that he gave to his students became almost as important as the subject matter which he was teaching. *\\"English first! Then Mathematics!\\" *\\"Say what you mean! Mean what you say!\\" *\\"You wanna jump out the window? You wanna go to the second floor!?

The documentary tracks the discovery and excavation of two graves beneath the ruins of Cancu√©n, once a prominent Maya city-state. The archaeological finds documented are notable as the National Geographic magazine presents them as evidence of the beginning of the end of the Maya city-states.Gugliotta, Guy (August 2007). \\"Fatal Rivalries\\". National Geographic 212 (2): pp. 97-109. Retrieved 2009-09-02. Plot The documentary tracks a joint National Geographic Society/Guatemalan Ministry of Culture funded expedition to discover whether there are any grave sites buried beneath the ruins of Cancu√©n, a city-state in the Pet√©n Basin (modern-day Guatemala). The city rose to prominence during the forty-year reign of King Taj Chan Ahk, and it is believed to have developed into an ancient trading centre linking the American continents. It is speculated there could be several mass graves in the temple district. The first twenty or so minutes of the documentary is vivid introductory footage showing the lay of the land, a re-enactment of a bartering market in Cancu√©n, the riches that would have been imported by the aristocrats of the city, and some of the finds already made. A further five minutes is spent covering the archaeologists searching for graves, before cutting to a site on the border of the city believed to contain a 12 m2 grave. Leading the dig is American anthropologist Arthur Demarest, who had discovered evidence of a mass grave after beginning the excavation of Cancu√©n in 1999. Within a year of beginning work on reconstructing the royal palace, when the size of the complex was realised, he had plans to employ local Maya villagers as guides to a site for eco-tourism; these new finds had far wider implications and the Ministry of Culture gave Demarest a team of archaeologists schooled in the history of the Pet√©n. As Demarest's grave is gradually revealed to be a tiled pool, a type of tomb used for ritual killings, and the sheer number of victims becomes apparent‚Äîin all, the remains of 31 men, women and children are found‚Äîthe archaeologists on site are given pause. The victims' demise had none of the hallmarks of traditional human sacrifices, and when the bones are examined by physical anthropologists it is discovered that they were not captured slaves at all but nobility. The shape of the child victims' skulls, with the foreheads compressed into the parietal to form a slender rise, is found exclusively in Maya children of noble birth. They are more surprised by the state in which the victims had been buried. The motive was not plundering, as they died wearing jade jewellery. Instead, individuals may have been hunted down and slaughtered because the attackers left their weapons with the corpses and viciously stabbed the children, many of whom were under the age of twelve (adulthood), in the back of the neck. One skeleton suggests that the blade entered under the mandible, implying the victim had been grabbed by the head and pulled back upon it, execution style. After traces of a fetus are found, the narrator announces this can only be the extermination of a family. A grisly account is given of the decline of the Maya civilisaton. Within decades of a city-state collapsing displaced persons would sweep through the surrounding regions, preying upon merchants using largely unguarded trade routes, which led to the peasants turning traitor and causing widespread violence. There are several scenarios which could explain a revenge attack of this scale, but it seems most likely that the lower classes of Cancu√©n had revolted. Half-way through the programme a royal burial is found 80 yards away from the pool, in the jungle outside of the city limits. The skeleton is identified as the remains of Kan Maax, a wealthy and powerful ruler of Cancu√©n who died around 800 AD, the same time as the royal family became extinct and approximately fifty years before the city was abandoned. It is observed that Maax had been buried in a shallow, unmarked grave \\"like a beggar\\", clear cut evidence that the killings were more than murder. Investigation Scholars had recently come to believe that Cancu√©n was not only a secular society, but that its rulers also avoided war‚Äî\\"bobbing and weaving\\" alliances.

In the summer of 1869, Jay Gould, attempting to create a railroad empire with a connection from New York City to the Pacific coast, negotiated with Lockwood, the treasurer and, according to author Kenneth D. Ackerman, the \\"dominant figure\\" of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. \\"After hours of haggling over a dinner of oysters, wine and steak at Delmonico's late one August night\\", Ackerman wrote, Gould came to an agreement with Lockwood that Gould's railroad would build a line into New York City for the narrow-gauge cars used by Lockwood's company in return for westward connections. Lockwood agreed to the deal despite opposition from Vanderbilt, who was simultaneously trying to gain control of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern by electing proxies to the board of directors. Learning of the deal, Vanderbilt launched a raid on Lakeshore's stock, which sunk the price from $120 a share to $95 and put Lockwood in danger of personal bankruptcy. Lockwood began making plans to scuttle the deal with Gould. He managed to sell his shares in Lakeshore to Vanderbilt for the bargain price of $10 million, turning over control of the company to him.Schlichting, Kurt C., Grand Central Terminal: Railroads, Engineering, and Architecture in New York City JHU Press, 2001, , via Google Books, retrieved December 22, 2008 Lockwood-Mathews Mansion in Norwalk, Connecticut In 1867, Lockwood commissioned Albert Bierstadt's The Domes of the Yosemite, the artist's second great, monumental Yosemite work, for $25,000.

Its function is to reinforce the jaw, though it also has the effect of considerably reducing the movement of the tongue by restricting the area available for muscles. Humans are the only primates to have protruding chins, though some fossils of early humans show evidence of a simian shelf.  Evolution of the Simian Shelf  In Maboko Island (1988), the lower jaw of a Kenyapithecus was found, and it provides signs of the simian shelf evolution in modern apes. Where the simian shelf is present, the bottom teeth will be leaning forward. This happened to be a unique feature of the Kenyapithecus leading there to be a link between the two. This sign of evolution was identified as shown through the lower incisors that lean forward and are known to be used to break hard objects. The lower incisors were concluded to be an adaptive feature as it was an adaptation for \\"hard object feeding including... large mandible... and upper incisors\\". Although the forward leaning lower incisors began to show up less in apes, the simian shelf still remained: \\"[it] was retained by most large bodied genera and served as a preadaptation for the evolution of broad lower incisors in living great apes\\". The simian shelf found in chimpanzees is not found in modern humans. It was found in a study that the human chin has no true purpose because the simian shelf in chimpanzees is to protect the jaw from the stress of eating and/or chewing. The human speech mechanism also played a role in the evolution or disappearance of the simian shelf. Changes in the jaw such as \\"widening of the mandibular arch, loss of the simian shelf, and development of the chin\\" allowed for the development of the speech mechanism. This suggests that the simian shelf was no longer found in modern humans due to the changes that occurred due to the development of speech.  \\"Fetal and infant growth patterns of the mandibular symphysis in modern humans and chimpanzees\\" Study  There is a study published by Michael Coquerelle, et al. that targets the study of the mandibular symphysis in the fetal and infant growth of chimpanzees. The mandibular symphysis consists of the external portion of the mandible, and the symphysis refers to the line seen between the two bones found in the middle of the mandible that appear during the fetal and infant stages. In the fetal chimpanzees, the study showed that the mandibular symphysis is \\"anteriorly inclined\\". It then begins to have \\"an increasingly vertical orientation up until birth\\". The study has shown that the shiftings that occur are due to the simian shelf becoming repositioned. The shifting that occurs with the simian shelf may show that \\"the suprahyoid muscles have a significant influence on the anterior growth of the symphysis\\". The mandibular symphysis in this case is also compared to that of the fetal and infant humans. As stated in the study, both, the human and chimpanzee, start out with a v-shaped mandible during the fetal stages, but the chimpanzee mandible remains in that v-shape leading to the development of the simian shelf. The forming of the simian shelf occurs due to the \\"basal symphysis [being] modified\\" as a result of the v-shape being maintained past the fetal stage.

SoftwareStrand NGS (formerly Avadis NGS)= Strand NGS is a software platform for next-generation sequencing data analysis. It can import raw read sequences from sequencing platforms like Illumina, Ion Torrent, PacBio, ABI, and 454 Life Sciences and supports fragment, single-end, paired-end, mate-paired, directional single/ paired end library types. Raw reads in formats FASTA, FASTQ, SAM, BAM, Unaligned BAM, BED, Counts data, VCF, VAL, or Eland formats can be imported into the tool. In addition, perform split read alignment for detecting long InDels and translocations. Strand NGS also allows users to perform quality control on the imported data and filter reads before the main analysis is performed. Version 2.6 of the tool supports six experiment types: ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, small RNA, Methyl-Seq, MeDIP-Seq and DNA-Seq. Gene, transcript, SNP, homology, gene ontology (GO), and other annotations needed for analysis can be downloaded directly from within Strand NGS website. : The ChIP-Seq analysis workflow allows users to identify enriched regions using three different peak finding algorithms - a simple sliding window based approach, MACS, and PICS. Depending on the experiment design, these regions could be transcription factor binding sites, methylation sites, etc. Motifs present in the identified binding sites can be discovered using a parallel implementation of the GADEM algorithm. Entity lists containing the genes in the neighborhood of the binding regions can be created and used in downstream gene ontology Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis. : The RNA- Seq experiment workflow allows users to measure expression levels of known genes and transcripts. It also allows discovery of novel exons, genes and splice junction. The Genome Browser in Strand NGS enables users to validate the predictions by allowing viewing of the results in the context of annotations from multiple sources such as NCBI, the UCSC Genome Browser, and Ensembl. Statistical tests, specifically designed to handling count based data, can be used for differential gene expression and alternative splicing analysis. A special \\"Gene View\\" visualization presents consolidated information about a gene and helps in the verifications of predictions. : The DNA-Seq experiment workflow has links for SNP and structural variation detection algorithms. The SNP prediction step finds homozygous and heterozygous SNPs and identifies overlaps with the provided dbSNP annotations. SNPs falling in genic regions are further analyzed and their effect on transcripts is described (similar to the Ensembl SNP Effect Prediction web- service). The structural variation analysis algorithms identify homozygous and heterozygous InDels, inversions and translocation events. In addition, Copy Number Variations can be detected using tumor-normal pairs. Visualization tools, namely Genome Browser, Gene View, and Variant Support View, are a key aspect of the software. Other visualizations available with tool are scatter plot, MvA plot, profile plot, histogram, heat map, box and whisker plot, and Venn diagram. Aided with visualizations, users a pictorial feel for statistical trends in the data. : Genome Browser in Strand NGS is an interface to visualize data, results, and annotations associated with the genome in one place. Annotation data, such as cytobands, genes, transcripts, etc., as well as results from the analyses, such as Peak regions, SNPs, Gene Fusions, etc. can be superimposed. Users can drag and drop data into the browser and also perform search operations. To navigate in the Genome Browser, users can scroll, pan, and zoom. Users may also color, filter, and label data points of interest. : Gene View is used to visualize individual genes and their transcripts. Users can see read coverage for known, as well as novel, exon partitions. Strand NGS also provides access to organism-specific interaction databases containing relations between proteins, small molecules, enzymes, complexes, biological processes, molecular functions, and gene families. The two million interactions present in these databases can also be augmented by importing pathways in GPML format (WikiPathways), XML format (BioCyc), BioPAX format from Reactome, Cancer Cell Map, etc. Gene lists generated by analysis steps can be used as the starting point for many pathway analysis operations. =GeneSpring= GeneSpring GX (version 9.0.0 onwards), GeneSpring Workgroup (version 7.0.0 onwards), and Mass Profiler Pro are developed by Strand's R&D; division in Bangalore. =Avadis= Avadis is a comprehensive data mining and visualization platform.

Then he was transferred to Ferro Carril Oeste, where he stayed for another couple of seasons. He did not have great success as a player his career was ended by a Cruciate ligament injury after playing in the lower leagues with Atlanta and CD FAS of El Salvador. = Coaching career = Perrone started his work as a football coach as the assistant manager to Carlos Griguol and then Daniel Bertoni for a number of top division teams in Argentina such as Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata and River Plate. Perrone took the step up to first team coaching in Ecuador managing with relative success teams like Olmedo and Deportivo Cuenca. In the city of Riobamba coaching a very modest Olmedo he finished fourth at the end of the 2006 season, he was then hired by Deportivo Cuenca for the next two seasons. In Cuenca he managed to make his team a contender for the title and to qualify for the 2008 Copa Libertadores. In the 2008 season he was having a pretty good year qualifying early to the final stages of the Ecuadorian championship, but the club's financial problems were unsustainable and he resigned as its manager. Soon after he left many of his players followed him. It is said that when he left the club owed him hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid salary. Soon after he left Deportivo Cuenca, he initiated negotiations with Ecuadorian giants Emelec. Rumors were quickly dissipated and the club announced Perrone as its new coach for the next two seasons. Along with Perrone Emelec hired many of Deportivo Cuenca's best players like Javier Klimowicz, Marcelo Fleitas, Polo Wila, and Mariano Mina. Perrone's teams are usually very organized and conservative, taking few risks in defense and being extremely effective in attack. He is also very famous in Ecuador for having good vision and hiring unknown players that end up playing well. Before Ecuador's National Team officialized Sixto Vizuete as its head coach, the Ecuadorian press considered Perrone as the first candidate to take that job. In 2011 Perrone became the coach of Rangers of Talca, team which was playing in Second Division of Chile, getting the second place of the championship, and then, go up to the Football First Division of Chile since 2012.  Personal life  Perrone is married with one of the daughters of famous Argentine coach Carlos Griguol. He acted as a mentor for Perrone's coaching career and has even visited Perrone during some of his spells as coach in many of his teams. In January 2008 he had to be taken to a hospital for severe chest pains caused by stress. He stayed in the hospital in Cuenca for a couple of days after a cardiac problem was ruled out.

History The junction under construction in 1966 The first section of the M40 to open was the section between junctions 4 and 5 in 1967, construction starting in 1964. The 1967 finished roundabout allowed interchange between the M40, the A404 to Marlow, the A404 into central High Wycombe and a minor residential street. The first alteration came in 1972 with the construction of the Marlow bypass (as the A404- the old A404 was downgraded to un-classified). Further urbanisation to the west of the roundabout led to another exit for the roundabout to Cressex and on through Wycombe to the A40-the new road was given the A4010 road number. In 2006, the Highways Agency constructed several improvements to the roundabout including a cut-through, bypassing the three northern exits and a new slip road from the A404 to the M40 westbound. Roads served The M40 meets the roundabout numbered as junction 4, temporarily dropping to dual two lane through the junction. The A404 road is dual-carriageway on both sides of the junction, although only the section south into Berkshire has primary status. The northern part goes on into High Wycombe town centre as a non- primary A-road. The only other classified road to meet the roundabout is the A4010 which leads on through the suburb of Cressex and on to Aylesbury.

This thesis is charged with having pushed a new generation of thinkers into re-evaluating the Socialist aesthetic heritage (among others Mi≈°ko ≈†uvakoviƒá, Marina Gr≈æiniƒá, and Ana Peraica) recognized as the discourse of post-socialist art. Groys is a member of the Association Internationale des Critiques d'Art (AICAO), and has served as a fellow of numerous institutions including International Research Center for Cultural Studies (IFK) in Vienna, Austria, Harvard University Art Museum, and the University of Pittsburgh. In 2001 he served as Director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. From 2003 to 2004 he headed the research program Post- Communist Condition in cooperation with Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and the Federal Cultural Foundation of Germany. Selected publications Groys has written over 150 articles on modern and contemporary art and Russian art and intellectual history in several languages. His books include *Russian Cosmism (2018) *In the Flow (2016) *Introduction to Antiphilosophy (2012) *The Communist Postscript (2010) *History Becomes Form: Moscow Conceptualism (2010) *Going Public (2010) *Art Power (2008) *The Total Enlightenment: Conceptual Art in Moscow 1960-1990 (2008) *Ilya Kabakov: The Man Who Flew into Space from His Apartment (2006) *Dream Factory Communism (2004) *The Total Art of Stalinism (1992) *Igor Sacharow-Ross: Apotropikon (1991) Groys has also published Thinking in Loop: Three Videos on Iconoclasm, Ritual and Immortality (DVD, 2008).

At Genentech, he discovered VEGF‚Äîand made the first anti-VEGF antibody‚Äîwhich suppresses growth of a variety of tumors. These findings helped lead to development of the first clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor, bevacizumab (Avastin), which prevents the growth of new blood vessels into a solid tumor and which has become part of standard treatment for a variety of cancers. Ferrara's work led also to the development of ranibizumab (Lucentis), a drug that is highly effective at preventing vision loss in intraocular neovascular disorders. Education Ferrara received his medical degree from the University of Catania, Italy, in 1981, and joined Genentech in 1988.

Dinosaur, other reptile, mammal, and micro and macro-floral remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation. The lack of extensive outcrops, limited geographic extent, and extreme structural deformation have limited paleontological explorations of the Wayan.  Geology and age  The Wayan occurs in the Caribou Mountains of eastern Idaho. Sediments are dominantly floodplain mudstones (many having undergone extensive pedogenic processes) with some fluvial sandstones and minor conglomerates, limestones, and tuffs. Carbonate nodules in pedogenic mudstones suggest a semi-arid, seasonal climate during deposition. Radiometric U-Pb dates from detrital zircons indicate a latest Albian to early to middle Cenomanian age. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating within one stratigraphic meter of an Oryctodromeus locality yielded an age of 99.1 +1.5/-1.3 Ma showing proximity to the Albian/Cenomanian stage boundary.Krumenacker, L.

Outcrop of the Wayan Formation  Fauna and flora  The vertebrate fauna is dominated by the small basal ornithopod Oryctodromeus, which dominates the vertebrate assemblage and is known from several partial skeletons. An ankylosaur, a Tenontosaurus-like iguanodontid, a hadrosaurid, dromaeosaurs, a tyrannosauroid, a possible neovenatorid allosauroid, a giant oviraptorosaur (represented by eggshell of the oogenus Macroelongatoolithus carleylei), indeterminate small theropods, possible neoceratopsians, large and small crocodilians, turtles, a variety of small mammals, and semionotid fish are known from very fragmentary remains.Krumenacker, L.

Taphonomy  Taphonomic modes of the Wayan are distinct. Fossiliferous 'pods' of Oryctodromeus skeletons and skeletal elements, sometimes with more than one individual represented, are the most common occurrence of vertebrate skeletal remains. Degrees of association and articulation range from fully articulated individuals to articulated strings of vertebrae and articulate limbs associated with other elements. These Oryctodromeus remains exhibit no appreciable pre-burial taphonomic modifications such as weathering, abrasion, breakage, or tooth marks. This combination of observations suggests the possibility of burial of these animals within unrecognized burrows. Excluding eggshell, almost all other vertebrate remains known from the Wayan occur as isolated teeth and partial to complete bones found in high energy fluvial lag and possible debris flow deposits. These remains exhibit a more typical range of taphonomic modification with varying degrees of abrasion and breakage typical of skeletal remains preserved in fluvial deposits. The overall fossil assemblage of the Wayan and patterns of preservation suggest that surface processes on the Wayan floodplains were less conducive to preservation, with preservation typically occurring subsurface and in fluvial channels.

Early life and education  Labib was born in 1905 in Cairo. His father was Cladius Labib, also an Egyptologist and Coptologist who was one of the first Egyptians to learn Hieroglyphics from the French Egyptologists in Egypt and who compiled a Coptic-Arabic dictionary. He grew up in Ain Shams, a suburb of Cairo, where his father had a house with a few acres of land (13 \\"feddans\\") that were used to cultivate fruits and vegetables. For preparatory school Labib went to the \\"Great Coptic School\\" and then to Khedivieh Secondary School, both in Cairo. After Labib received his \\"Bachaloria\\", he entered the Faculty of Law. However, the Faculty of Archeology had recently opened and he joined this as well. At the final year, exams for both studies clashed, so he choose to sit the Archeology final which he passed with distinction. Labib was sent for higher studies to Berlin, Germany in 1930. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the Frederick William University in 1934. The subject of his doctoral degree was King Ahmose I, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, who expelled the Hyksos from Egypt. Labib showed that the Hyksos stayed in Egypt for 150 years (previously suggested periods were much longer) and that they came from Canaan. He was the first Egyptian to obtain a doctorate in Egyptology. His teachers in Germany included Herman Grapow (with whom he stayed in touch till the latter's death in 1967) and Kurt Heinrich Sethe.  Career  Labib returned to Egypt and was appointed Lecturer in the Institute of Archeology at Cairo University in 1935. In 1945 he obtained the post of Keeper at the Egyptian Museum, Cairo. He was later appointed director of the provincial museums, during which period he established a few museums around the country, and expanded the Aswan Museum. He was instrumental in transferring the Ismaila Museum from the Suez Canal Company to the administration of the Department of Antiquity. In 1951, he was appointed Director of the Coptic Museum, a post he kept until retiring in 1965. Labib was chosen as acting director of the Egyptian Museum in the summer of 1964 to investigate the disappearance of a piece of Tutankhamun's treasures. He remained acting director of the Egyptian Museum for a year. During his directorship of the Coptic Museum he turned the museum into a world-famous research centre for Coptic Studies. He was one of the first to use the word \\"Coptology\\". Labib started the excavations in Abu Mena, Western Desert in 1951. Through his contacts, he managed to build a rest house that was spacious and well furnished (built by the German Archeological Institute, Cairo). Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria used to visit the place and even stayed there, to hold an early service in the site of the ancient Cathedral of Saint Menas. Later Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria started the building of the Monastery of Saint Mina. Labib was also involved with excavations in \\"Tel-Atrib\\", near the city of Banha in Lower Egypt; the site of a great Cathedral before the Arab invasion. Pope Shenouda III had an interest in and visited the site of these excavations. Pahor Labib was one of the world leaders in the Coptic language. He was also well versed in hieroglyphs. Above shows a postcard in hieroglyphs from Professor Herman Grapow to his student Pahor Labib sent in 1932 Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria with Pahor Labib in the 1960s Pahor Labib with Henry Kissinger in the Coptic Museum, Labib showing a page of the Nag Hammadi Library preserved in special glass. Nag Hammadi texts Labib also contributed to the study of the Nag Hammadi texts. Translating these texts was a mammoth task as the Coptic language encountered was also dealing with philosophy. The UNESCO had an interest in these texts and established an international committee to translate and publish this work. Labib was a secretary, vice president, and president of this committee. The first publication of part of the collection was by him in 1956. Publications of the translated manuscripts carried on until 1984. Labib believed that this philosophy is Egyptian in origin (rather than Greek) and presented a paper on the subject to the First International Congress of Coptology in Cairo in 1976. A Coptic exhibition was held in Villa Hegel in Essen (West Germany) in 1963 to which Labib was an invited guest. Labib served on many committees both nationally and internationally owing to his expertise in many fields. In the national arena he served on dozens of committees including the highest in the land to award the most prestigious awards in Arts and Social Sciences in the country. He also served on many committees for Archeology and Tourism, including one for Coptic Tourism. Labib further served on the management boards of the Coptic and Islamic Museums in Cairo and on the council for \\"Greater Cairo\\". He was a council member of the Coptic Archeology Institute and a founding member of the Institute of Coptic Studies and La Societe de Saint Minas Le Miraculeux. Labib was a founding member and President of the National Society of Art and served on the Council of the Society \\"Des Amis des Arts\\". Labib taught at the University, both Egyptology and Coptic Language, especially the Hieroglyphic origins of Coptic words. His knowledge in both languages, with all their dialects and variations, was outstanding. Labib was a member of the German Institute of Archeology, Berlin, and the Archeology Institute of the University of Prague, and the UNESCO Committee for Museums.  Awards  Labib was awarded the Decoration of the High Cross from Germany in 1976. Following a visit by Crown Princess Margrethe II of Denmark to the Coptic Museum in 1963, he was awarded the World Decoration of Denmark. Also, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia awarded Labib a Gold Medal following a visit to the museum in 1959. From 1976‚Äì1994 he was an Honorary President of the International Association for Coptic Studies.

Bennett got approval from the tax department and most investors to do this, with J C Williamson Ltd stepping in for the BBC and ABC. The final $50,000 of the budget came from Bennett himself. Bennett wanted to add some levity in the material and so cast David Argue, who had impressed him on stage. He was impressed by Gia Carides' improvisational skills in theatresports and cast her to act alongside him. Nurse Lydia Miller rounded out the main cast.

The species has long been overlooked because of confusion with Balea perversa. Taxonomy The specific name sarsii is in honour of Norwegian biologist Michael Sars. According to Welter-Schultes Balea heydeni is conspecific with Balea sarsii. The name heydenii has now been superseded as the species was described from Norway at an earlier date than von Maltzan, under the name sarsii Pfeiffer (synonym lucifuga Bourguignat 1857). This species has been separated from the closely related, common and wide-spread Balea perversa and redescribed by Gittenberger et al. (2006)Gittenberger E., Prece R. C. & Ripken T. E. J. (2006). \\"Balea heydeni von Maltzan, 1881 (Pulmonata: Clausiliidae): an overlooked but widely distributed European species\\". Journal of Conchology 39(2): 145-150. under its junior synonym name Balea heydeni von Maltzan, 1881. The valid name for this taxon is, however, Balea sarsii. Distribution Balea sarsii is a western- Atlantic element, found on the Atlantic Islands, in Portugal, northwestern Spain, and the coastal parts of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Britain and Ireland it is the commoner of the two Balea species, occurring also in the inland. The only locality in Denmark is M√∏ns Klint. A recently undertaken revision of Balea-material from Sweden and Norway in the G√∂teborg Natural History Museum and the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm revealed two localities for Balea sarsii from the Swedish west coast (the Island of Vinga outside G√∂teborg and the Island Stor√∂n in the archipelago of V√§der√∂arna in the province of Bohusl√§n). Totally the species is now known from six Norwegian localities, of which five are situated in Hordaland County. It is considered a very rare species in Norway, because only sixteen Norwegian specimens have been found, among thousands of Balea perversa. This species is known to occur in: * Atlantic Islands * Portugal * northwestern Spain * coastal parts of France * coastal parts of Belgium * coastal parts of the Netherlands * Great Britain * Ireland * M√∏ns Klint in Denmark * Sweden * Norway: Hordaland County and Sogn og Fjordane County The type locality is Flor√∏ in Sogn og Fjordane County. This is also the northernmost locality of Balea sarsii known in Europe. Description Lateral view of a shell. The shell of this species is sinistral (left-handed) in its coiling. Differs from Balea perversa in its more slender and yellowish rather than brownish shell. The first whorl increases in diameter more rapidly and the sculpture is more weakly striated (with coarse growth lines rather than distinct riblets). Balea sarsii, differs from Balea perversa through its, in most cases, shorter, broader shell, in which the whorls increase more quickly in width. Balea sarsii reaches a maximal height of 7 mm; Balea perversa might be higher (up to 10 mm). The sculpture in Balea sarsii is also more wrinkled, coarser and less regular, compared to the fine, regular riblets typical for Balea perversa. The shell colour is also yellowish ‚Äì light brown, compared to the usually somewhat darker brown in Balea perversa. A weak, parietal denticle may be present in Balea perversa, but not in Balea sarsii. All these characters are, however, variable; especially the shell dimensions. The most reliable character to use in separating the two species is the form of the apical whorls: in Balea perversa this part of the shell is almost cylindrical, but in Balea sarsii it is conical. Ecology Balea sarsii sometimes co-occur with Balea perversa. Such sympatric occurrences are not uncommon in various parts of the distribution area, and probably both species have very similar ecology. Balea- species are rarely found on the ground, they are climbers and live on vertical surfaces (rocks, trees etc.) References This article incorporates CC- BY-3.0 text from the reference External links *Balea sarsii at Animalbase Category:Clausiliidae Category:Molluscs of Europe Category:Gastropods described in 1847 ","title":"Balea sarsii"},{"id":"20812322","title":"Paul David Wilson"},{"id":"20812334","text":"The Willie Way is the fifteenth studio album by country singer Willie Nelson. This was also the last album of new material released by RCA Records before Nelson's departure for Atlantic Records and move to Austin, Texas. Background The Willie Way capped off Nelson‚Äôs underwhelming seven year tenure at RCA Records. He never attained the same success as a recording artist that he had as a songwriter, and became more frustrated with not being allowed to use his own band on his recording sessions. Producer Chet Atkins adhered to the Nashville Sound with Nelson, smothering his songs with violins and syrupy background vocalists in an attempt to break him as a national star, but the efforts proved fruitless. By the early seventies the apathy seemed to cut both ways, with author Michael Streissguth noting that The Willie Way ‚Äúarrived in stores packaged in the most unimaginative album sleeve ever to come out of Nashville.‚Äù The album includes his first cover of Kris Kristofferson‚Äôs ‚ÄúHelp Me Make It Through the Night,‚Äù which Nelson would recut for Sings Kristofferson in 1979. \\"You Left Me a Long, Long Time Ago‚Äù would be included as a bonus track on the 20th Anniversary edition of Wanted!

It is regarded as a serious pest species throughout its range. Frederick Askew Skuse described the species in 1889 from specimens collected in the Blue Mountains and Berowra. The species name is derived from the Latin words annulus \\"ring\\" and rostrum \\"bill\\". The female is a moderate-sized brown to dark brown mosquito, with a single pale prominent broad band on the middle third of its proboscis, and similar bands on its legs. It closely resembles the female of the related Cx. sitiens. The latter species has a narrower band on its proboscis. Breeding takes place anywhere there is standing water, from swamps and ponds to all kinds of man-made puddles‚Äîirrigation channels, bamboo stumps, cacao shells, the bottoms of canoes. The water can be clean or polluted, in sun or shade, and fresh or brackish. Culex annulirostris mosquitoes are active between spring and late autumn. During this time they appear most commonly at dusk, though can also be active during the day and indoors. They can travel 5‚Äì10 km from their place of birth and feed on mammals and birds. Only the female feeds on blood as it needs to consume protein to help in reproducing. The male drinks nectar. It is an important vector for a number of arboviruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, Kunjin virus and Japanese encephalitis, as well as dog heartworm and the roundworm Wuchereria bancrofti in New Guinea. There is evidence it carries myxomatosis.

Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.Weishampel et al., 2004, pp.556-563  Description  The Urbi√≥n Group, named after the Picos de Urbi√≥n, comprises a sequence of brown limestones in a matrix of black silt, sandstones, claystones and conglomerates deposited under terrestrial conditions, in alluvial fan and fluvial environments. The contact with the overlying Enciso Group is exposed at the Presa Enciso tracksite.Melero Rubio & P√©rez Lorente, 2011, p.31Presa de Enciso tracksite (2PRE) at Fossilworks.org  Fossil content  Demandasaurus darwini = The fossil bones of Demandasaurus were recovered in the \\"Tenadas de los Vallejos II\\" quarry, located southwest of the town of Salas de los Infantes (Province of Burgos, northern Spain). In geological terms, this area lies within the western Cameros Basin, which is located in the north‚àíwesternmost part of the Iberian Range, outcropping in the provinces of Burgos, Soria and La Rioja. This basin is one of the most subsident basins formed during the rift interval at the end of the Jurassic and the Early Cretaceous, which affected this part of the Iberian Peninsula. The sediments of the Tenadas de los Vallejos II quarry belong to the Castrillo de la Reina Formation and comprise red clay beds intercalated with sheet‚àílike sandstone channel fills that are interpreted as floodplain and fluvial channel deposits respectively. The fluvial system of the Castrillo de la Reina Formation shows a braided channel pattern with well developed and drained floodplains. This lithostratigraphic unit belongs to the fifth depositional sequence of the six ones that divide the basin. The age of the fifth depositional sequence is Late Barremian to Early Aptian as is suggested by charophyte and ostracod biostratigraphy. The Tenadas de los Vallejos II site was discovered in 1999 during prospection work carried out by the Archaeological‚àíPalaeontological Group of Salas de los Infantes (Colectivo Arqueol√≥gico‚àíPaleontol√≥gico de Salas de los Infantes, CAS). Ten caudal vertebrae, a haemal arch, two ischia and a femur, as well as bone fragments were collected in the site. Excavations were carried out during the years 2002‚Äì2004, covering a surface area of some . Approximately 810 skeletal elements and bone fragments were recovered, and most of them belong to a single specimen of rebbachisaurid sauropod. The remains were found disarticulated in the same bed and in close proximity to each other. The neural arches of the vertebrae are firmly co‚àíossified to the centra. There are no anatomically repeated elements, and the bones correspond presumably to a single individual. The relative size of the bones suggests a medium‚àísized individual whose total length was approximately . In addition, several vertebral centra and femur fragments from a small ornithopod, two spinosaurid theropod vertebrae and a crocodile tooth were recovered from the site.Torcida et al., 2011, p.537 = Other fossils = Among others, the following fossils have been reported from the Urbi√≥n Group:Urbi√≥n Group at Fossilworks.org * Chitracephalus dumonii - Pinilla de los Moros Formation * Larachelus morla - Pinilla de los Moros Formation * Europatitan eastwoodi - Castrillo de la Reina Formation * Goniopholis sp. * Lepidotes sp. * Polacanthus sp. * Baryonychinae indet. * Crocodyliformes indet. * Hypsilophodontidae indet. * Iguanodontia indet. * Rhabdodontidae indet. * Testudines indet. * ichnofossils ** Brachyguanodonipus sp.

The sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates of the formation, that due to syn-sedimentary faulting varies greatly in thickness from , were deposited in fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine environments. The formation was deposited in the Galve Sub-basin of the Maestrazgo Basin in central-eastern Spain. During deposition, Iberia was an island, separated by seas from North Africa and France. Underlying the Camarillas Formation is the also highly fossiliferous El Castellar Formation and the Artoles Formation rests on top of the formation.Herrero Gasc√≥n & P√©rez Lorente, 2009, p.68 The Camarillas Formation has provided a rich fossil assemblage of fossils of mammals, snakes, turtles, crocodylians, fish, dinosaurs and their eggs. Various tracksites of families of dinosaurs exist in the formation. Dinosaur remains have been recovered from the formation.Weishampel et al., 2004, pp. 556-563  Description  Iberia was an island throughout the Early Cretaceous The Camarillas Formation was first formally defined by Can√©rot et al. in 1982 and later redefined by Salas (1987).Royo Torres et al., 2013, p.5 Both Camarillas and Galve are in the Galve Sub-basin, a section of the Aliaga Basin, in the Iberian Range. All these basins were formed during the Permian‚ÄìTriassic, when the main faults were active, and they are filled with Mesozoic‚ÄìQuaternary sediments. The Upper Permian to Upper Jurassic deposits at the site of the Camarillas Formation are all of continental origin. In a second extensional stage during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, the Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay opened, and the Iberian Peninsula rotated from left to right. At this time, the sediments were marine or showed the influence of the sea, as shown in the deposits of the Higuerueles and Villar del Arzobispo Formations in the Galve Sub-basin. Finally, during the Early Cretaceous and Oligocene‚ÄìMiocene there were compressive phases with tectonic inversion and formation of continental basins.S√°nchez Hern√°ndez & Benton, 2014, p.582 Camarillas Formation, in beds of similar age to the La Maca outcrop in the Galve area where the remains of an iguanodontid dinosaur have been found. The Camarillas fossil site is in light brown clay and limestone rocks with fossil wood remains. The sedimentology is similar to that described in the Galve area, because the Camarillas Formation shows scarcely any lateral variations in facies within the Galve Sub-basin. The Camarillas Formation sandstone is fluviatile, and four groups of paleochannels are distinguished, the first towards the bottom of the succession. These channels become thinner towards the top, and this was interpreted by D√≠az and Y√©benes (1987) as evidence that there was an alluvial fan with a multichannel system. The lithology of the deposits which fill these channels and their geometry are typical of low- sinuosity channels. Towards the top of the Camarillas Formation, there is a predominance of deltaic fan deposits with marked marine influence. Nevertheless, Soria (1997) mentioned that she found no facies association whose evolution and geometry suggested a well developed deltaic system.S√°nchez Hern√°ndez & Benton, 2014, p.583 The formation spreads across the Camarillas graben and the Remenderuelas half-graben.Navarrete et al., 2013, p.63  Fossil content  The Camarillas Formation has provided a rich fossil assemblage comprising dinosaurs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, fish and mammals. Several new species were described from the formation, among others the mammals Galveodon nannothus, Eobaatar hispanicus, Crusafontia cuencana, Lavocatia alfambrensis and Parendotherium herreroi, the turtle Galvechelone lopezmartinezae and the crocodyloform Bernissartia fagesii.

He is Sir Thomas's second son and plans to be ordained as a clergyman. He falls in love with Mary Crawford who constantly challenges his vocation. Edmund goes ahead with ordination. At the end of the novel he marries Fanny Price. Character Thomas Edwards regards Edmund as the most believable of Austen's heroes, not least because she allows the reader to have reservations about him. He has reality but also limitations.Edwards, Thomas (1965) ‚ÄúThe Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park.‚Äù Nineteenth-Century Fiction, vol. 20, no. 1, p 64, 65. www.jstor.org/stable/2932492 (Also in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pp. 18, 19.) Edmund is a naturally kind and compassionate person, as demonstrated by his attitude towards Fanny Price, his impoverished young cousin who has come to live with Edmund's family from her home and family in Portsmouth. It is the sixteen year old Edmund who first takes pity on Fanny, first sees that she is clever and first develops her mind. Edmund's kindness and generosity to Fanny distinguishes him from the rest of his family, who tend to exploit Fanny's good nature or mock her. Edmund's ironic description of himself is that \\"... there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.‚ÄùMansfield Park ch. 11 (Kindle Loc. 1274-1275) The master leaves Edmund's father, Sir Thomas Bertram, is the master of Mansfield Park. After the Rev Mr Norris, Edmund's uncle dies, the living of the Mansfield parish is kept for him until he is old enough (twenty-four) to be ordained. This plan is undermined when Edmund's older brother Tom accumulates such large gambling debts that his father has to sell the living to a Dr Grant to settle his accounts. Another parish, ten miles away at Thornton Lacey, is still promised to Edmund. Dr. Grant and his wife move into Mansfield parsonage. Sir Thomas goes to Antigua to settle problems with his Caribbean estate; he takes Tom with him and leaves Edmund in charge of the English household. Edmund's sisters, Maria and Julia, are pleased their father has gone and enjoy a new sense of freedom. After a year, Tom is sent back to England but amuses himself by visiting friends and taking part in horse racing. Edmund still seems to be in charge of the estate. Mrs. Grant's young half-sister, Mary Crawford comes to live with her and she is accompanied by her brother, Henry Crawford. Edmund becomes an admirer of Mary and inadvertently neglects Fanny. = Ordination under attack = leftLionel Trilling believed, based on a letter Austen sent in 1813 to her sister, Cassandra, that Austen had chosen ordination as the subject for Mansfield Park. Paula Byrne argues (as do others) that this is based on a misreading of the letter, although, she says, there is no doubt that Edmund's vocation is at the centre of the novel.Byrne, Paula (2013) The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things. HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition, Locations 3837-3838 During a family visit to Mr Rushworth's estate at Sotherton Court, the young people are shown into the family chapel. Mary applauds the late Mr Rushworth's decision to abandon the twice daily prayers, eloquently describing such practice as an imposition for both family and servants.Mansfield Park, pp. 86-87 Edmund acknowledges from his own experience that long services can be boring but maintains that without self-discipline a private spirituality will be insufficient for moral development. She then overhears some family banter about Maria's intended marriage to Mr Rushworth and learns for the first time of Edmund's intention to become a clergyman. Mary is embarrassed about her previous remarks but also shocked. Importantly for the novel, her presence and her voice become a constant assault on Edmund's vocation. Mary also attacks Edmund's expectation of a living, one based on privilege rather than on merit. Sir Thomas still offers him a guaranteed living at Thornton Lacey where he can lead the life of a country gentleman. Edmund's defence of the widespread practice of patronage is backed up by Fanny. His argument has well developed logic but lacks a robust spirituality. Says Barbara Hayley, \\"Despite all temptations, Edmund never loses sight of his duty as a clergyman, taking an unusually dedicated and spiritual view of it.\\" = Garden of delights = Illicit misconduct and sexual temptation are suggested by Austen from the moment the young people reach a door of the house, ‚Äòtemptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to... all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, [and] as by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out‚Äô.Byrne (2017) ch. 9, Kindle ed. loc. 3518 They soon find themselves in the wooded area known as the wilderness. Juliet McMaster argues that Austen often used understatement, and that her characters disguise hidden powerful emotions behind apparently banal behaviour and dialogue.McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 page 50. This is evident as Edmund, Mary and Fanny debate the merits of an ecclesiastical career.McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 pages 52‚Äì53. Though the exchanges are light-hearted, the issues are serious.McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 pages 53‚Äì54. To press her point, Austen has set the scene in the wilderness where their serpentine walk provides echoes of Spencer's, The Faerie Queene, and the \\"sepentining\\" pathways of the Wandering Wood.McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 page 54. Spencer's 'Redcrosse Knight' (the novice knight who symbolises both England and Christian faith) is lost within the dangerous and confusing Wandering Wood. The knight nearly abandons Una, his true love, for Duessa, the seductive witch. So too, Edmund (the would-be Church of England minister) is trapped with the seductive Mary within the moral maze of Sotherton's wilderness and becomes neglectful of Fanny. Edmund's resolve is put to an almost Biblical test.Ross, ch. 8, Kindle ed. loc. 3824 Mary's aim is that his desire for her will overcome his desire for the ministry. Austen, unlike many of her contemporary writers, almost never quotes from the Bible;Ross, ch. 4, Kindle ed. loc. 1669 yet biblical themes are not difficult to find. The 'wilderness' experience contains hints of the Garden of Eden in Genesis, the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites in Exodus and of the temptation of Jesus in the Gospels. Mary, like her brother, fulfils the serpent's subtle role as she offers moral shortcuts to fulfilment and happiness. Mary's strategies to dissuade Edmund from his ministry range from gentle persuasion ‚Äì ‚ÄòYou really are fit for something better. Come, do change your mind. It is not too late. Go into the law‚Äô ‚Äì to cruel attempts to emasculate him: ‚ÄòMen love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other lines [army or law], distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman is nothing‚Äô.Byrne, Paula (2017)The Genius of Jane Austen: Her Love of Theatre and Why She Is a Hit in Hollywood. ch.8, Kindle loc. 3099-3134 HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.MP ch. 9 Thomas Edwards describes Mary's charming 'femininity' as full of innuendos which Edmund resists with blundering logic.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 8‚Äì9 McMaster comments on Austen's restrained eroticism. When Fanny is tired, Edmund takes her arm to provide support but when Mary extends him her arm, he expresses amazement at its lightness. He \\"registers, and within the bounds of polite converse, expresses the thrill he feels at this physical contact with Mary\\". McMaster contrasts this with that of Austen's critic, D. H. Lawrence, who provides loving descriptions of \\"that exquisite and immortal moment of a man's entry into the woman of his desire\\".McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pp 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, ed: Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 pp 54-55. One evening at Mansfield Park, news comes that Sir Thomas is planning to return earlier than expected. Mary's thoughts return to Edmund's ordination and she challenges him about the corruption of the clergy, declaring the profession unworthy, filled only by lazy and gluttonous men like her brother-in-law, Dr Grant. 'His curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine'.Mansfield Park, ch. 11, p.110 Austen often exposed clergy corruption through parody. Mary's view of Regency clergy is widely confirmed by historians; Edmund's commitment to integrity and morality represents a minority vision.Hague, William (2008) William Wilberforce: The Life of the Great Anti-Slave Trade Campaigner (Text Only) . HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Ed. ch. 1, loc. 226 ff. = Lover's Vows and the return of the master = When Tom settles on a plan for putting on the play, Lovers' Vows at Mansfield Park, both Edmund and Fanny are opposed. Austen's presentation of the intense debate about theatre tempts the reader to take sides and to miss the nuances. Edmund, the most critical voice, is actually an enthusiastic theatre-goer. Fanny, the moral conscience of the debate, \\"believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them.\\" She thought Henry the best actor of them all.Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park, ch. 18 (Kindle Locations 2201-2202) Edmund objects to the play, believing it somehow violates propriety, but fails to articulate the problem convincingly.Tave, Stuart \\"Propriety and Lover's Vows\\" pages 37‚Äì46 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 pages 39‚Äì40. His intense objection to an outsider being brought in to share in the theatricals is not easy for the modern reader to understand. Mr Rushworth's view that, \\"we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing\\", is affirmed only by Sir Thomas himself.Jane Austen. Mansfield Park (Kindle Locations 2460-2461) Sir Thomas is an intensely private person. Eventually, Edmund is persuaded that bringing in a person from another family would be worse than his participating in an intimate scene with Mary. Tom and Maria only feel 'glee' at the thought of the would-be clergyman acting in an improper play.Edwards, Thomas \\"The Difficult Beauty of Mansfield Park\\" pages 7‚Äì21 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 17 During rehearsals, Fanny observes the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the parts of Anhalt and Amelia, the two lovers. This fills her with misery but also jealousy.Tave, Stuart \\"Propriety and Lover's Vows\\" pages 37‚Äì46 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, New York: Chelsea House, 1987 page 43. Some time later, Mary describes to Fanny her fondest memory at Mansfield Park when she played the dominant role with Edmund in a position of sexual submission. \\"I never knew such exquisite happiness ... Oh! it was sweet beyond expression.\\"Byrne (2017) ch. 8. (Kindle Locations 3122-3124)MP ch. 36 Sir Thomas returns just before the play is due to be staged and is greatly displeased. Edmund admits his culpability and emphasises Fanny's constant opposition to the play. Exodus Following Sir Thomas's return, there is a gradual exodus of the young people from Mansfield Park. Maria goes ahead with her marriage to Mr Rushworth and leaves for her honeymoon accompanied by Julia. Within a fortnight Mary, who has been five months at the parsonage and now left alone, befriends Fanny. It is November. = The attack continues = Edmund still hopes that Mary will love him as he is, in his chosen occupation; Mary makes it clear that she will only marry him if he pursues a more lucrative and prestigious career. She continues her attack on his vocation and the church he represents. Edmund defends as best he can. During a lively discussion in the parsonage shrubbery that also includes Fanny, Mary recognises Edmund's worth and is attracted by his steadiness and integrity, but she cynically insists that there is no glamour in being ‚Äòhonest and poor‚Äô ‚Äì ‚ÄòI have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich‚Äô.(MP, ch. 22, p. 213) During a lively conversation in the Mansfield Park drawing room, Mary is reminded that Edmund's ordination is impending. She will not lower herself to marry a clergyman, in particular a clergyman with a serious vocation: ‚ÄòIt was plain that he could have no serious views, no true attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to‚Äô.(MP, ch. 23, p. 228) = The ball = Edmund gives Fanny a necklace for the ball arranged at Mansfield Park for her benefit. At the same time Edmund shows how much his judgement has been blinded by love when he tells Fanny that in her and Mary Crawford‚Äôs characters ‚Äòthere is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy‚Äô. The more reliable narrator has stated that Mary has none of Fanny‚Äôs delicacy of taste, of mind, or of feeling.Lane, Maggie. Understanding Austen (Kindle Locations 1329-1331). Robert Hale. Quotes from MP ch. 27. After promising him the first two dances at the ball, Mary tells Edmund it will be the last time she will dance with him, because the next time they meet he will be ordained, and \\"she never has danced with a clergyman... and she never will\\". Edmund drops his decision to propose. The following day, December 23, Edmund leaves for Peterborough and his ordination. Mary is upset but she still cannot cut herself off from Edmund. She recognises his quality, respects him, and is in love with him. Fanny believes, and the narrator states at the end of the novel, that Mary would have eventually altered her views and married Edmund if not for the scandal that ends up dividing them. = Departures and decline = Edmund stays on longer with his friends in Peterborough. Tom is away with his horse-loving friends. When Edmund eventually returns, he learns that Fanny has rejected a proposal from Henry. Still blinded by Henry's charisma, he tries to persuade her to reconsider. Henry and Mary leave for London. Sir Thomas decides to send Fanny for a prolonged visit to her family's lowly home in Portsmouth, so that she can better appreciate the benefits of a marriage to Henry. When Tom becomes dangerously ill, Mary callously reflects that Edmund will inherit the baronetcy and estate if his brother dies. Dr and Mrs Grant depart for Westminster. In London, Henry Crawford has an affair with Edmund's sister Maria, who is now married to the wealthy but stupid Mr Rushworth. They run away together, bringing disgrace and embarrassment to the Bertrams. Edmund unburdens himself to FannyEdmund visits Mary in London and is affronted by her response to Henry and Maria's \\"folly\\". Rather than evincing moral disapproval, she feels that they have simply made imprudent decisions that have led to their being caught, and that Maria ought to continue living with Henry in order to persuade him to marry her and thus save their social standing. Edmund is disgusted by Mary's lack of moral outrage and concern for social standing. He tells her so and leaves, thus ending their attachment. Edmund's reality and also his limitations are expressed when he reports to Fanny about his final distressing conversation with Mary and tries to sort out the truth from his personal bias. He is still conflicted, sad to 'close the door' on her forever. He gradually tells Fanny about his disillusionment with Mary over many days and she comforts him. = Restoration = Edmund's love for Fanny springs from 'a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness'. Says Hayley, \\"Only after he has turned to her for comfort that this love comes to life. Their early relationship is reversed; he is the child, she the parent - his guide, comforter and friend.\\" Sir Thomas gives his approval to the marriage. Edmund has been given the parsonage at Thornton Lacey, and he and Fanny move there. Dr Grant later gains a long sought after position in Westminster, leaving the Mansfield parish available for Edmund and Fanny. Juliet McMaster underlines the subtleties of Mansfield Park. She challenges the common criticism that it is unbelievable how quickly Edmund finally transfers his affections from Mary to Fanny. All along the 'subsurface movement' of the novel has been \\"Edmund's unconscious courtship of Fanny, which has been concurrent with his deliberate courtship of Mary\\".McMaster, Juliet \\"Love: Surface and Subsurface\\" pages 47‚Äì56 from Jane Austen's Mansfield Park edited by Harold Bloom, Chelsea House: New York, 1987 pages 55‚Äì56. Austen herself, in the final chapter (which is essentially an epilogue) asks the reader to determine the time-scale for Edmund's dawning recognition of his love for Fanny.

The unit itself does not supply the majority of the manpower for such taskings, but trains individuals from the RMP, Royal Navy Police, RAF Police and Royal Marines Police Troop for the role, as well as taking on urgent and short-notice taskings. History The CPU was formed in the late 1970s, after a number of RMP bodyguards attended the Special Air Service bodyguard course at Hereford, and brought the skills back to an RMP-specific course, the first of which ran in 1976. Three years later, the course and unit moved to Longmoor Camp where it remains. Structure The CPU is a sub-unit within the RMP's Specialist Operations Regiment, commanded by a major. It is considerably smaller than most RMP companies, however, with just a small staff of experienced CP operatives who act as instructors or are held ready to deploy on short-notice tasks. Role Close protection operatives trained by CPU protect high-ranking British army officers in high-threat environments, most notably during the Iraq war and Afghanistan war, and ensuring counter- insurgency and peacekeeping operations. They also protect British ambassadors and other high-ranking Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials in locations where the threat level demands it. Training The CPU offers a range of training courses. These include the eight-week Close Protection Course that qualifies service police men and women to be CP operatives, a further eight- week pre-deployment training course carried out before teams deploy overseas, and specialist driving courses for locally-employed civilian drivers. Equipment The CPU trains and deploys with a range of specialist weapons not used by the majority of the British army.

Background By 1972 Nelson had made fourteen albums for RCA with not much to show for it. RCA head Chet Atkins stuck to the formula of the Nashville Sound, which had churned out hits for other country stars throughout the sixties but did not complement Nelson's highly stylized musicianship, and promotion behind Nelson's LPs had been historically non- existent. Further alienating Nelson was the label's perplexed reaction to his 1971 concept album Yesterday‚Äôs Wine, a suite of songs examining mortality influenced by the Bible and the works of Edgar Cayce. Nelson's live shows bore little resemblance to the sound of his RCA albums, and Atkins refusal to allow him to record with his band left him disillusioned. Recording and composition As Atkins scaled back his production duties at RCA, Nelson worked more with Felton Jarvis, who also produced Fats Domino, Skeeter Davis, and Elvis Presley. The album was recorded at RCA Studios in Nashville and contains all Nelson originals. The album is most notable for containing Nelson's first solo recording of \\"Good Hearted Woman\\", a song he composed with his friend Waylon Jennings. Jennings, who had been fighting many of the same battles with RCA as Nelson, started writing the song and asked Nelson to help him finish it during a late-night poker game at the Fort Worther Motel on Jackson Highway in Fort Worth. By all accounts, Nelson's contribution was minimal, with his third wife Connie recalling, \\"The only part Willie came up with was ‚ÄòThrough teardrops and laughter they walk through this world hand in hand.‚Äô Waylon said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs missing‚Äô and gave Willie half the song.\\" Nelson also collaborated with songwriter Don Bowman on ‚ÄúStay Away From Lonely Places\\". Bowman previously wrote \\"Just to Satisfy You\\" with Jennings, a song Waylon and Willie would take to the top of the charts in 1982. The album cover, shot by Jimmy Moore, portends Nelson's impending stylistic change - flanked by his wife, Connie, and his producer Felton Jarvis, dressed as a chauffeur, Nelson poses in front of a Rolls-Royce in full-freak cowboy regalia, battered guitar case in tow.

Two strangers ‚Äì one white (Jack), one Aboriginal (Gary) ‚Äì steal a car in western New South Wales and drive around the coast. The original characters came from a story by Adelaide writer John Emery, with whom Noyce had worked on a short film. Australian reviews of the film were mixed, and it opened commercially in only one cinema. Plot Jack and Gary steal a car and head off around the back roads of Western New South Wales. They pickup a trio of fellow travellers - Gary's uncle Joe, a French hitchhiker and an embittered woman. Joe drunkenly shoots a stranger and they are chased by police. The police arrest Joe and Jack and shoot Gary. Cast *Bill Hunter as Jack *Gary Foley as Gary *Zack Martin as Joe *Terry Camilleri as Jean Claude *Julie McGregor as Anna *Essie Coffey as Aboriginal Woman *Allan Penney as Shopkeeper Production John Emery had written one of Noyce's short films at film school, Caravan Park, and pitched him another story, The First Day of Spring, about a young aboriginal. They developed the script together.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p204-205 Gary Foley agreed to act provided that he would be responsible for the film‚Äôs indigenous content. The film was mostly shot on location near Bourke and Brewarrina in western New South Wales and was funded in part by a $25,000 grant from the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission. Shooting finished in April 1977 when the finance ran out. Noyce applied to the Australian Film Commission for money to finish the film, however he decided instead to launch Backroads at the Sydney Film Festival in 1977.

In 1898 it was moved to Belo Horizonte. At first, the Law School occupied a building on Rua Pernambuco (at Savassi neighborhood), then it was moved to Rua da Bahia (at Lourdes neighborhood) and after that, to Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica (Republic Square), which today corresponds to the Pra√ßa Afonso Arinos (Afonso Arinos Square), where it still remains as of 2009. In 1958, the old building was demolished, giving place the Villas- Boas building (inaugurated by the Director Antonio Martins Villas-B√¥as), the Valle-Ferreira building (inaugurated by the Dean Washington Peluso Albino de Souza in 1990) and the Library building, inaugurated in 1998 by the Dean Aloizio Gonzaga Araujo de Andrade. Inside the Library building, it was built, in original size and design, the first fa√ßade of the Free School of Law. In December 2007, the Congregation of the School approved its transfer to UFMG's Pampulha Campus, buildings are to be constructed in coming years. The School's founder and first director, Brazil's former president Afonso Pena, was succeeded by Antonio Gon√ßalves Chaves, Francisco Mendes Pimentel, Edmundo Pereira Lins, Arthur Ribeiro de Oliveira, Francisco Brant, Lincoln Prates, Antonio Martins Villas-Boas, Jose Geinaert of Valle Ferreira, Alberto Deodato Maia Barreto, Lourival Vilela Viana, Wilson da Silva Melo, Messiah Pereira Donato, Jos√© Alfredo de Oliveira Baracho, Washington Peluso Albino de Souza, Gonzaga Aloizio Araujo de Andrade, Ariosvaldo de Campos Pires, Aloizio Gonzaga de Andrade Ara√∫jo, Joaquim Carlos Salgado, Amanda Flavio Oliveira and Fernando Gonzaga Jayme. In honor of its founder, the UFMG School of Law is still affectionately called the Vetusta Casa de Afonso Pena (Ancient House of Afonso Pena), by its students and academic community. In 1908 it was founded Centro Acad√™mico Afonso Pena or Afonso Pena Academic Center, the CAAP, one of the oldest and most traditional of Minas Gerais and Brazil. Notable alumni includes ex-presidents Arthur Bernardes, Tancredo Neves, and governor Milton Campos.

The pattern is characterized by a contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices (known as a rising wedge) or a downward trend in prices (known as a falling wedge). A wedge pattern is considered to be a pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.  Falling wedge  Falling wedge The falling wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes lower lows and lower highs with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in a downward trend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates the downtrend is losing steam. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a bullish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the downward trend is losing strength and the resumption of the uptrend is in the making. In a falling wedge, both boundary lines slant down from left to right. The upper descends at a steeper angle than the lower line. Volume keeps on diminishing and trading activity slows down due to narrowing prices. There comes the breaking point, and trading activity after the breakout differs. Once prices move out of the specific boundary lines of a falling wedge, they are more likely to move sideways and saucer-out before they resume the basic trend.  Rising wedge  Rising wedge The rising wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is found in a downtrend, it is considered a bearish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the downtrend is in the making. In a rising wedge, both boundary lines slant up from left to right. Although both lines point in the same direction, the lower line rises at a steeper angle than the upper one. Prices usually decline after breaking through the lower boundary line. As far as volumes are concerned, they keep on declining with each new price advance or wave up, indicating that the demand is weakening at the higher price level. A rising wedge is more reliable when found in a bearish market. In a bullish trend what seems to be a Rising Wedge may actually be a Flag or a Pennant (stepbrother of a wedge) requiring about 4 weeks to complete.

First pioneered by Jack Durrance and Harrison Butterworth in September 1938, it was the second free ascent of Devils Tower, following the first ascent led by Fritz Wiessner in 1937. The Wiessner Route lies a few hundred feet to the right of the Durrance Route and has a comparable difficulty. Today the Durrance Route is the most popular route on Devils Tower. It is considered a more interesting and enjoyable route than the Wiessner Route due to variable terrain and better belay stances. The route is recognized in the historic climbing text, Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, and other guide books. Route Description The route begins below and to the right of the two trees in the reference image. It then ascends the left side of the leaning pillar and continues up the most inset dihedral. The second pitch involves jamming and stemming up the Durance Crack, followed by another pitch along the Cussing Crack. It then ascends a flake, followed by a chimney to a chockstone. The final pitch has two variations ‚Äî a direct vertical finish (Baileys direct), or the classic \\"Jump Traverse\\" which involves leaping an exposed gap to the right, then following the easy \\"Meadows trail\\" to the summit. It involves some difficult techniques including off- width, and despite its easy grade is not well suited to beginners. Significant featuresLeaning column= An volcanic column has been slightly tipped from vertical. Reports that it was too unstable prompted a United States Geological Survey inspection in 2006. The inspection found that although the pillar did move under a climber's weight, it was unlikely that it would dislodge the pillar.

Background Although Nelson continued to be frustrated with the production and poor sales of his albums at RCA, his live show continued to develop in the early seventies as he started acquiring the core members of his band ‚Äì Bee Spears on bass, Paul English on drums, Mickey Raphael on harmonica, and his sister Bobbie on piano - which he referred to as ‚ÄúFamily.‚Äù Nelson later recalled after first playing with Raphael he ‚Äúbegan to see how, rather than as an occasional sit-in, he could become part of my family ‚Äì a loose term that I started using to describe my band. As a depiction of people coming together to make music, I like the term 'family' more than 'band.' It‚Äôs a warmer word that suggests genuine care and love.‚Äù Nelson had also discovered his Martin N-20 classical guitar, known as ‚ÄúTrigger,‚Äù which further contributed to his evolving live sound, but his albums at RCA remained mired in the staid Nashville formula. In the 2003 documentary Lost Highway the singer explained, ‚ÄúI had a pretty good following on the road travelling but what I was doing wasn‚Äôt coming out on the record, and I felt like if we could‚Äôve got into the studio with the band, and do it the way we‚Äôd been doing it every night, we would‚Äôve had a better chance.‚Äù Nelson would get his opportunity to record with his band in 1973 when he recorded the LP Shotgun Willie in New York's Atlantic Studios with Jerry Wexler, but Willie Nelson and Family followed the same production blueprint as his recent RCA albums. Recording & Composition The collection contains a mix of covers, such as the Hank Williams classic ‚ÄúI‚Äôm So Lonesome I Could Cry,‚Äù and original compositions, including the prophetic ‚ÄúWhat Can You Do to Me Now?,‚Äù a forlorn ballad Nelson wrote with Hank Cochran in December 1970 just days before his house burned down on December 23. The Texan later quipped, ‚ÄúEven though the title ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat Can You Do to Me Now?‚Äù ‚Äì seemed to invite trouble, the story was really about getting strong in the face of adversity.‚Äù Nelson also wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Memory,‚Äù which would be released as a single and reach number 28 on the country singles chart. Willie Nelson and Family also contains Nelson's first cover of ‚ÄúToday I Started Loving You Again,‚Äù written by Merle Haggard and Bonnie Owens. Haggard would appear at Nelson's first Dripping Springs Picnic in 1974 and record several duet albums with Nelson. In his 2015 autobiography Nelson wrote: :Also sang Merle Haggard‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday I Started Loving You Again‚Äù...I met him when he was playing bass with Wynn Stewart at the Nashville Nevada Club in Las Vegas...Merle was another one of those rugged individualists who, like me, was trying to make sense of all the nonsense in the music business. We became buddies for life.‚Äù Nelson, who covered Joni Mitchell and Fred Neil on his Both Sides Now album, continued to show his appreciation for the new generation of singer-songwriters of the youth culture at the time by recording James Taylor‚Äôs ‚ÄúFire and Rain.‚Äù Nelson had also started cutting material by more progressive country tune-smiths like Mickey Newbury and, on this album, Kris Kristofferson, a ‚Äúbrilliant writer‚Äù whose ‚ÄúSunday Morning Coming Down‚Äù contained the poetic realism similar to his own lyrics. Nelson would rerecord the song on his tribute LP Sings Kristofferson in 1979. Reception AllMusic: ‚ÄúOver the years, Nelson has shown that he sometimes looks at relationships differently than the average songwriter (such as ‚ÄòCrazy‚Äô), with a little more thought and from new perspectives. After all, not everyone's life is moon, June, and honeymoon.

Plot The story takes place in Victorian London, where the story's protagonist/narrator, Henry Adams, has ended up penniless and in rags after a boating accident in the US swept him out to sea. Two very rich and eccentric brothers spot him and give him an envelope with no information. Seeing money inside the envelope, Henry immediately heads for a cheap dining house, and he pulls the money out of the envelope after he eats (in the presence of the proprietor). Inside the envelope is a single peerless bank note for one million pounds sterling. Without knowing it, Henry is the subject of a bet: Brother B believes that the mere possession of this symbol of wealth, without any other means of support, will enable someone to survive for the month. Brother A, on the other hand, feels that the prohibition (see next paragraph for terms of the bet) against exchanging the note for cash will render it useless. After he recovers from being stunned, Henry asks the dining house proprietor (named Harris) for change; Harris tells him not to worry about payment. Afterwards, Henry reads the note from the brothers, which explains that they have made a bet on him and that he has to return to the house in 30 days with the bank note intact and unspent; the writer of the accompanying note stated that, if Henry wins the bet for him, Henry can have any situation that he is qualified to fill. Henry realizes that he would not be easily able to exchange the bank note in the bank without being questioned about how he had come to have it, charged with theft and arrested. He would also not be able to spend it since no ordinary person would be able to change it. Finally, in desperation, Henry decides to see if he can use the note to get a cheap suit to replace his rags, similar to the way he got his meal; when he pulls out the million-pound note to pay, the store manager gives him an entire wardrobe on credit. Ultimately, he becomes a celebrity in London as the \\"vest pocket million-pounder\\" or the \\"vest-pocket monster\\", and Harris' dining house becomes so famous that Harris actually lends Henry money, but Henry tries to keep his borrowings under control so that he will be able to pay everyone back over time when he gets his situation. After 10 days of growing fame, Henry reports to the US ambassador in London, who Henry learns was a classmate of his father's at Yale. He is invited to a dinner party that night where he meets a young British woman, Portia Langham, with whom he is instantly smitten. During flirting, he tells her the entire story of the gentlemen and their bet, which she finds hilarious. Also at the party was a good friend of Henry's from San Francisco named Lloyd Hastings, who was in London to sell shares in a mine for a commission of ¬£400,000, or $2 million US, but had been unable to find any rich Londoners willing to buy and is about to return to the US without making a sale. Henry offers to use his celebrity to endorse the investment for Hastings in return for 50% of the commission; the shares sell out by the end of the month, although Henry does not tell Portia of his new wealth. At the end of the month, Portia insists on going with Henry to see the brothers. Henry's success entitles him to a situation from Brother B, but Henry turns it down, showing the brothers his profits from the mining deal. At that, Portia reveals that Brother B is her stepfather, and Henry then asks him for the \\"situation\\" as his son-in-law.

It was previously the Roman Catholic boys' school Presentation College, Reading, until it went into administration in 2004. In March 2010 it was announced that the school would close at the end of the academic year. History The school opened in 1931 as Presentation College, Reading, an independent boys' day school run by the Presentation Brothers. In May 2003, the Presentation Brothers made the highly controversial decision to close the school the following summer. However, due to the \\"Save Pres\\" campaign by staff and students, the Presentation Brothers reversed the decision and the school was transferred to a trust. However, in mid-2004 the school went into administration and was taken over by the Licensed Trade Charity and became the Elvian School. The final headteacher of the school was Paul Bevis. On Sunday, 14 June 2009, one of the school's students, 15-year-old Nicholas Rice, died in an air collision incident over Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire. His Grob Tutor aeroplane collided with a civilian glider, during an Air Experience Flight. The pilot of the Grob Tutor, 62-year-old Michael Blee, was also killed, while the pilot of the glider, Henry Freeborn, parachuted to safety and survived. Closure In January 2010, staff and parents of pupils were sent letters stating that the future of Elvian School was unclear and that the feasibility of continuing to operate was being considered during a consultation period. On 3 March, a further letter and announcement by the school's director of education, Ian Mullins, stated that the consultation had unanimously agreed that the school could not run into the 2010/11 academic year. The school closed in July 2010. Rebirth In 2013 members of the West Reading Education Network WREN announced plans to open a Free School on the site of the former Elvian School, re-using some of the Elvian school buildings. These plans were delayed whilst developers Taylor Wimpey agreed to purchase the site subject to obtaining planning permission for 182 homes. Planning permission was refused. Taylor Wimpey appealed the refusal, and their appeal was dismissed in December 2013 after a public enquiry.http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/parents-win-victory- elvian-school-6368363 Taylor Wimpey appealed to the High Court for a judicial review of the refusal, which was dismissed in June 2014.

Life Nianhan was the eldest son of Sagai (ÊííÊîπ) and a great-grandson of Wugunai, the chief of the Wanyan tribe. He was a relative of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder of the Jin dynasty, because Aguda was Sagai's cousin and Wugunai's grandson.Tao (1976), genealogical chart on p. 26. Nianhan served as one of Aguda's chief advisers in the Jurchen rebellion against the Khitan-led Liao dynasty in 1114. He participated in the ensuing war between the Jurchens and Khitans that led to the destruction of the Liao dynasty and its replacement by the Jin dynasty.Franke 1997(I), p. 154 Under Aguda's successor, Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong), Nianhan played a major role in the wars against the Song dynasty. During the campaign of 1125-1126, he was the \\"left vice- marshal\\": the commander the Jurchen Western Army, which invaded Shanxi Province and besieged Taiyuan, while the Eastern Army, led by the \\"right vice- marshal\\" Wolibu (Êñ°Èõ¢‰∏ç), was besieging Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng).Tao (1976), pp. 20-21. When the war against the Song dynasty resumed in 1126, Nianhan, who had taken Taiyuan, joined Wolibu at the walls of Bianjing. Together the two armies besieged the Song capital for a month, conquered it on January 9, 1127, captured the Song emperors Huizong and Qinzong, and returned to the Jin capital, Huining Prefecture (present-day Acheng District, Harbin), with their prisoners and loot. Nianhan continued to be influential throughout Emperor Taizong's reign. He, along with Wanyan Xiyin, was instrumental in persuading Emperor Taizong to bequeath the throne to Aguda's son, Hela (later Emperor Xizong), rather than to his own son, Puluhu (Wanyan Zongpan).Tao (1976), p. 37. Like other top Jurchen generals, during Emperor Taizong's reign, Nianhan was able to run a portion of the empire as a semi-independent warlord, running his own government in Shanxi Province. However, he lost his military power during Emperor Xizong's drive to centralise the control of the empire in the hands of the central bureaucracy, and in 1135 was transferred to a position in the central government.Tao (1976), pp. 41, 139 (note 41).

Most have minute or small leaves with a sharp tip, single, tube-shaped flowers arranged in leaf axils and with the ends of the petals rolled back with hairs in the inside of the tube. Description Plants in the genus Styphelia are usually erect or spreading shrubs that have egg-shaped, elliptical or oblong, more or less sessile leaves with many fine, almost parallel veins and a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are usually arranged singly in leaf axils with small bracts grading to larger bracteoles at the base and five, usually coloured sepals. The petals are fused to form a cylindrical tube with their tips rolled back. The inside of the petal tube is hairy and the five stamens and thread-like style extend beyond the end of the tube. The fruit is a drupe with a dry or slightly fleshy mesocarp and a hard endocarp. Taxonomy and naming The genus Styphelia was first formally described in 1795 by James Edward Smith in his book A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland.

She set three world water speed records, first on Lake Maggiore in September 1937, then later twice raising her own record. The name \\"K3\\" was derived from its Lloyd's unlimited rating, and was carried in a prominent circular badge on the forward hull.  Design  After Campbell's achievement of the 300 mph land speed record with Blue Bird in 1935 he retired from the land speed record. Shortly afterwards he switched his attentions to the water speed record, at that time dominated by the American Gar Wood.Harris, Skimming the Surface Blue bird was designed by Fred Cooper and built by Fred Goatley of Saunders-Roe. The design was intended to be the smallest possible hull capable of carrying the Rolls-Royce R racing engine. Campbell had already used this engine in his Blue Bird car, and they had also been used in pairs in Segrave and Kaye Don's Miss England boats. Of the three individual R engines used by K3, one had previously run in Blue Bird and one in Miss England II. The most compact layout placed the engine behind the driver and relied on a front-mounted v-drive gearbox to reverse the direction of the drive shaft and increase the shaft revolutions 1:3 to 9,000 rpm. This gearbox, along with much of the mechanical design, was designed by Reid Railton who had previously designed cars for Campbell. Unlike Gar Wood's multi-engined monsters, Blue Bird was designed for a single engine, and the smallest possible craft to carry it. She was long with a beam of , compared to 38 feet for Miss America X. Her estimated top speed on paper was to be 130 mph. It was usual at this time for English hydroplanes to have their engines mounted as far astern as possible (Gar Wood disagreed, and had pointed this out to Segrave). In Cooper's usual style, the hull was wide and low, with a narrow, rounded, central superstructure. The engine was placed right back to the transom and the superstructure was extended rearwards in a fabric-covered overhanging conical nacelle. This rearward weight distribution encouraged planing, but could lead to some peculiar attitudes when setting off at slow speeds, as the whole boat appeared to be sinking by the stern. The displacement was only and the engine alone weighed . Construction was of plywood, although the attention paid to weight-saving was such that this was laminated to order from varying numbers of veneers, rather than sawn from factory-made standard sheets. The frames are formed of single-piece unjointed sheets of 7-ply, the hull skins of 5-ply and the deck of 6-ply. Even the engine bearers were made of a central plywood box girder. Reserve buoyancy in the event of an accident was provided by 36,000 ping pong balls, sewn into pillow cases.  Records  On 1 September 1937, at Lake Maggiore on the border between Switzerland and Italy, K3 set a record of 126.32 mph, breaking Gar Wood's previous 5-year-old record. The next day she improved this to 129.5 mph. Breaking the design speed of 130 would require another year, when on 17 August 1938 at Lake Hallwyl in Switzerland at 130.91 mph (210.63 km/h).  Ventnor \\"three pointer\\"  Despite these records, Campbell was dissatisfied with their small margin over the previous record (6 mph). K3's hull was a single-step hydroplane, as already used for Miss England. This lifted half of the hull clear of the water, reducing drag upon it. A new idea from America was the \\"three point\\" hydroplane (known as the 'Ventnor Three Pointer' due to the form being popularised by the Ventnor Boat Works, New Jersey USA), where the forward hull is divided into two sponsons and the boat rides at speed on just these and the transom. This reduces the wetted area (and drag) still further, while increasing stability at speed. It was not possible to convert K3 to this hull form, so Campbell began work on a whole new boat, K4, re-using the same engine.  Restoration  The original boat was restored at Filching Manor in East Sussex and is now in working order. The boat was stripped down and fully rebuilt using parts to the original standard, though the engine is a Rolls-Royce Meteor (an unsupercharged version of the Merlin developed for use in tanks) rather than the larger, supercharged Rolls-Royce R originally used. She ran on the regatta course at Henley-on-Thames during the Traditional Boat Festival on 18-19 July 2015.

It is a continuation of the Katamari Damacy series of games. It was released worldwide in the App Store on (and subsequently removed on ). In 2010 Namco announced a Windows Phone 7 version of the game. A version was released for Android in 2012 exclusively for Samsung Android devices. In this game, the King of the Cosmos instructs the game's protagonist ‚Äì the Prince ‚Äì to gather as many objects as possible to grow a highly adhesive ball called a Katamari large enough so that he can pick up special objects to bring to the King so that he can regain his memory. The gameplay is identical to that of Katamari Damacy, where the player rolls a highly adhesive ball called a Katamari, collecting various objects of increasing size until it becomes large enough to transform into a star. The game utilizes the specialized technology from the iPhone and iPod Touch in which players tilt the device to move the Katamari across the playing field. I Love Katamari received mixed reviews. While it has been praised for its game presentation, it has also been criticized for performance and control issues. The performance and control issues were improved in an update, but not entirely fixed. As of 2018 the game has been delisted from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, though it is not available on the Windows Store, the page for it is still active. Gameplay Gameplay of I Love Katamari In I Love Katamari, the player controls a highly‚Äìadhesive ball called the katamari. The object is to make the katamari as large as possible by running over and collecting objects of increasing size. The more objects players collect, the larger the katamari becomes. One reviewer described the game as follows: \\"Basically, the object is to roll a ball around a level and pick up as much junk as you can to make the ball bigger. It sounds EPIC, and it‚Äôs fun to play and really addicting.\\" Instead of using analog controllers to control the katamari as in the home console Katamari games, players roll the katamari by tilting the iPhone/iPod Touch in the direction they want the katamari to go. The goal is to collect specific objects requested by the King of the Cosmos within a specified time limit. Reception I Love Katamari has received some praise and some criticism from various reviewers. While some reviewers, such as Nicole Lee from CNET, praised the game for its intuitive usage of the iPhone/iPod Touch technology, other reviewers such as Luke Plunkett from Kotaku and Levi Buchanan from IGN have heavily criticized the game for its lack of responsiveness in controls and handling of the katamari as well as software lag that could cause the game to freeze. Namco Bandai released an update for the game, improving some performance and control problems previously experienced by users.

He primarily played in midfield and spent the majority of his career at Derby County where he played 420 times, placing him in the top ten for total appearances for the club. He also played for Tulsa Roughnecks in the NASL. Early life Powell, the son of ex-Derby County player Tommy Powell, went to Gayton Avenue Junior School, in the Littleover suburb of Derby, at the age of 11 he then moved to the Bemrose School just like his father once had many years before him. He is a keen Birmingham City supporter. Football career While at Bemrose School, Powell impressed the then Derby County managerial team of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor enough for Clough to sign him for Derby County on a visit to the school premises. Powell then went on to make his first team debut aged 16 years and 30 days in a Texaco Cup tie against Stoke City, which Derby County won 3‚Äì2. He made his league debut 3 days later aged 16 years and 33 days in the 2‚Äì1 win against Arsenal. Whilst at Derby County, Powell played as defender and midfielder. Powell made 352 appearances in the league for The Rams, scoring twenty goals. Powell won the player of the year (now named the Jack Stamps trophy) in the 1978‚Äì79 season. Powell went from a schoolboy star into an exceptional professional league player. Despite playing in a declining league side towards the end of his Derby County career, Powell was completely dedicated to Derby County. He was part of the team during some of their highest and lowest moments; a First Division title win in 1975, a European Cup semi-final appearance in 1976, relegation to the Second Division in 1980 and relegation to the Third Division in 1984. He retired in 1985 after well over a decade with the Rams, who had missed out on promotion back to the Second Division but would follow it up with two successive promotions. Powell and his father, Tommy appeared in 826 senior games between them for Derby County. Powell now works at Derby College.

Although the film isn't the first animated feature made in Chile, being the second after Alfredo Serey's 1921 film La Trasmisi√≥n del Mando Presidencial (The Transmission of Presidential Control), it is considered the country's first \\"modern\\" animated film. The movie is based on the Chilean comics character Mampato created in 1971 for the magazine of the same name by Themo Lobos and Eduardo Armstrong, and later reprinted as the comic-book Cucal√≥n, the story for the film being adapted from the seventh adventure in the series: \\"Mata-ki-te-rangui\\". Plot Excited by the stories he knows about Easter Island, Mampato, a young boy with a belt device that allows time- travel, goes with his caveman friend Og√∫ to the ancient land of pre-columbian Rapa Nui. There they meet a little girl named Marama and discover the old traditions of the natives. Involuntarily, the protagonists get involved in the conflicts and rivalries of the island's inhabitants, where the ariki people subjugate the Orejas Cortas, Marama's tribe. Production Mampato is, with Condorito, the most popular and acclaimed comic strip from Chile. Cine Animadores, an emerging animation studio, chose Mampato to be made into the first feature-length animated film in Chilean history since the 1920s. Starting production in 1999, director Alejandro Rojas made a treatment with Themo Lobos and selected the seventh story rather than the first one, because it was based on Easter Island, a world-renowned location (with its famous Moais) best suited for a strong Latin American advertising campaign and as a means to generate non-Chilean interest. Although the film was completely produced and animated in Chile, the voice acting was made in Mexico with recognizable voice actors like Mario Casta√±eda and Alondra Hidalgo. This was an attempt to achieve a neutral Spanish accent, but the choice was criticized in Chile for it reduced the Chilean feel of the original material (although the Mexican voice actors did get to say some Chilean Spanish slang words). Reception The film got very good to decent reviews by critics and was Chile's submission to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2002.

A continuous function, in Heine‚Äôs definition, is such a function that maps convergent sequences into convergent sequences: if xn ‚Üí x then g(xn) ‚Üí g(x). The continuous mapping theorem states that this will also be true if we replace the deterministic sequence {xn} with a sequence of random variables {Xn}, and replace the standard notion of convergence of real numbers ‚Äú‚Üí‚Äù with one of the types of convergence of random variables. This theorem was first proved by Henry Mann and Abraham Wald in 1943, and it is therefore sometimes called the Mann‚ÄìWald theorem. Meanwhile, Denis Sargan refers to it as the general transformation theorem. Statement Let {Xn}, X be random elements defined on a metric space S. Suppose a function (where S‚Ä≤ is another metric space) has the set of discontinuity points Dg such that . Then : \\\\begin{align} X_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow\\\\text{d}\\\\ X \\\\quad & \\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad g(X_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow\\\\text{d}\\\\ g(X); \\\\[6pt] X_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow\\\\text{p}\\\\ X \\\\quad & \\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad g(X_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow\\\\text{p}\\\\ g(X); \\\\[6pt] X_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{a.s.}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\ X \\\\quad & \\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad g(X_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{a.s.}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\ g(X). \\\\end{align} where the superscripts, \\"d\\", \\"p\\", and \\"a.s.\\" denote convergence in distribution, convergence in probability, and almost sure convergence respectively. Proof This proof has been adopted from Spaces S and S‚Ä≤ are equipped with certain metrics. For simplicity we will denote both of these metrics using the x ‚àí y notation, even though the metrics may be arbitrary and not necessarily Euclidean. =Convergence in distribution= We will need a particular statement from the portmanteau theorem: that convergence in distribution X_n\\\\xrightarrow{d}X is equivalent to : \\\\mathbb E f(X_n) \\\\to \\\\mathbb E f(X) for every bounded continuous functional f. So it suffices to prove that \\\\mathbb E f(g(X_n)) \\\\to \\\\mathbb E f(g(X)) for every bounded continuous functional f. Note that F = f \\\\circ g is itself a bounded continuous functional. And so the claim follows from the statement above. =Convergence in probability= Fix an arbitrary Œµ > 0\\\\. Then for any Œ¥ > 0 consider the set BŒ¥ defined as : B_\\\\delta = \\\\big\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in S \\\\mid x otin D_g:\\\\ \\\\exists y\\\\in S:\\\\ x-y<\\\\delta,\\\\, g(x)-g(y)>\\\\varepsilon\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. This is the set of continuity points x of the function g(¬∑) for which it is possible to find, within the Œ¥-neighborhood of x, a point which maps outside the Œµ-neighborhood of g(x). By definition of continuity, this set shrinks as Œ¥ goes to zero, so that limŒ¥ ‚Üí 0BŒ¥ = ‚àÖ. Now suppose that g(X) ‚àí g(Xn) > Œµ. This implies that at least one of the following is true: either X‚àíXn ‚â• Œ¥, or X ‚àà Dg, or X‚ààBŒ¥. In terms of probabilities this can be written as : \\\\Pr\\\\big(\\\\bigg(X_n)-g(X)\\\\big>\\\\varepsilon\\\\big) \\\\leq \\\\Pr\\\\big(X_n-X\\\\geq\\\\delta\\\\big) + \\\\Pr(X\\\\in B_\\\\delta) + \\\\Pr(X\\\\in D_g). On the right-hand side, the first term converges to zero as n ‚Üí ‚àû for any fixed Œ¥, by the definition of convergence in probability of the sequence {Xn}. The second term converges to zero as Œ¥ ‚Üí 0, since the set BŒ¥ shrinks to an empty set. And the last term is identically equal to zero by assumption of the theorem. Therefore, the conclusion is that : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\Pr \\\\big(\\\\bigg(X_n)-g(X)\\\\big>\\\\varepsilon\\\\big) = 0, which means that g(Xn) converges to g(X) in probability. = Almost sure convergence = By definition of the continuity of the function g(¬∑), : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}X_n(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}g(X_n(\\\\omega)) = g(X(\\\\omega)) at each point X(œâ) where g(¬∑) is continuous. Therefore, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr\\\\left(\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}g(X_n) = g(X)\\\\right) &\\\\geq \\\\Pr\\\\left(\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}g(X_n) = g(X),\\\\ X otin D_g\\\\right)  &\\\\geq \\\\Pr\\\\left(\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}X_n = X,\\\\ X otin D_g\\\\right) = 1, \\\\end{align} because the intersection of two almost sure events is almost sure.

It is isolated from ergot or fermentation broth and it serves as starting material for the production of bromocriptine. Chemistry Ergocryptine is a mixture of two very similar compounds, alpha- and beta-ergocryptine. The beta differs from the alpha form only in the position of a single methyl group, which is a consequence of the biosynthesis in which the proteinogenic amino acid leucine is replaced by isoleucine. Biosynthesis The biosynthetic pathways to ergocryptine starts with the prenylation of L-tryptophan in an SN1 fashion with Dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP). The DMAPP is derived from Mevalonic Acid. This reaction is catalyzed by a prenyltransferase enzyme (Prenyltransferase 4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase) named FgaPT2 in A. fumigatus. An X-ray structure of the prenyltransferase FgaPT2 and tryptophan has been reported, and used to propose a three step mechanism (formation of allylic carbocation, nucleophilic attack of tryptophan on the carbocation, then deprotonation to restore aromaticity and generate the product, 4-dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT)). DMAT is then N-methylated at the amino of the tryptophan backbone with the EasF enzyme, named FgaMT in A. fumigatus. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) being the methyl source. Ergocryptine-part1 The next step in the biosynthesis of ergocryptine is the transformation of 4-dimethylallyl abrine to Chanoclavine-I. It has been shown that the enzymes EasE and EasC (FgaOx1 and FgaCat in A. fumigatus, respectively) are both required to generate Chanoclavine-I from 4-DMA abrine. Mutation experiments altering these enzymes independently stopped the pathway at abrine. This indicates that cooperation between EasE and EasC is necessary. Fig2- ergot alkaloid biosynthesis Fig3 - part 3 in biosynthesis of ergocryptine Chanocalvine-I is then oxidized to chanoclavine-I aldehyde with NAD+ dependent enzyme EasD (FgaDH in A. fumigatus). Chanoclavine-I aldehyde is a branch point, leading to different ergot alkaloids, depending on the specific fungus. In C. purpurea, chanoclavine-I aldehyde is converted to argoclavine with EasA, referred to as the old yellow enzyme or FgaOx3. This process occurs via keto- enol tautomerization to facilitate rotation about a carbon-carbon bond, followed by tautomerization back to the aldehyde, and condensation with the proximal secondary amine. The iminium species created by cyclization is then reduced to the tertiary amine, yielding agroclavine. Fig3-detail look at mechanism in biosynthesis of ergocryptine A cyctochrome P-450 monooxygenase enzyme catalyzes a two electron oxidation of agroclavne to the corresponding primary alcohol, elymoclavine. Elymoclavine is then oxidized by four electrons by a P450 monooxygenase to give paspalic acid. Paspalic acid then undergoes isomerization of the carbon-carbon double bond that is in conjugation with the acid, to give D-lysergic acid. Fig4 - part 4 in biosynthesis of ergot alkaloid ergocryptine Lysergic Acid is a branch point in the biosynthesis of ergoamides and ergopeptines. On the path to ergocryptine, an ergopeptine, the tripeptide is installed by a Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthase (NRPS). It has been shown that there are two enzymes, D-lysergyl peptide synthases (LPS) 1 and 2, which are responsible for the tripeptide connection to lysergic acid. The timing of the oxidation of valine to an alcohol is not exactly known. However, it is speculated that the oxidation occurs while bound to the NRPS LPS2. Ergocryptine is found in two forms, differing in the amino acid used by the NRPS. The alpha form contains the amino acid leucine, while the beta-form uses the amino acid isoleucine.

It is located in the town of Chinhoyi in Mashonaland West about 120 km from Harare towards Lake Kariba and the Zambian border. It is among the first sights visible when approaching the town from Harare, across a brigde to the Chinhoyi General Hospital. The CUT hotel is located adjacent to the main campus.About us CUT The Chinhoyi University of Technology has grown out of the Chinhoyi Technical Teachers‚Äô College that was founded in 1991. The first-degree programmes were offered in 1999 under the control of the University of Zimbabwe. Soon afterwards, in 2001, the institution gained full university status. Today, the university provides undergraduate courses in the fields of agriculture, engineering, and business sciences. Technical teacher education, and creative art and design, are offered through the university's single institute, the Institute of Lifelong Learning. With nearly 4 000 students and an academic staff of 163, the university describes itself as ‚Äòa small but highly selective institution‚Äô. There are a number of foreign students from other African countries at the university. A Strategic Management postgraduate masters programme was introduced in 2005, and ‚Äòcontinues to flourish‚Äô, a claim that warrants respect when the records show that 62 master's degrees were conferred in 2008, alongside the nearly 700 undergraduate degrees. In addition, a new school is being planned, the School of Hospitality and Tourism, which as part of its academic programme will run a hotel existing on the experimental farm as a commercial venture. The university is there to serve a great purpose to the whole nation.SARUA Students at the university have won numerous awards in recognition of their innovation. Accommodation is offered on the CUT campus but due to an increase in enrollment, it is limited to mostly freshman and final year students. Most of the students have to rent around the town in areas such as Cold Stream and Mzari. Cold stream is closer to campus but is a lot more crowded and unsafe relative to the farther, more relaxed Mzari. Landlords and residents of the town benefit from this and school season is big business for the town. A typical Hostel at CUT The school has a range of well maintained sporting facilities among them soccer fields, basketball, volleyball and tennis courts, a swimming pool and a gym hall for miscellaneous activities. Students can borrow sporting equipment for use and then return them at an agreed upon time. Students from different fields of study usually participate in friendly sporting challenges, chiefly football.

Rockefeller in Lakewood Township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. History and Construction of the Rockefeller Estate John Rockefeller began acquiring property in Lakewood, New Jersey in March 1901. In early November 1903, he purchased , including from the Ocean County Hunt and Country club which became the core of the Rockefeller Lakewood estate. The Club had held the first Professional Golf Association tournament on their grounds on January 1, 1898. In March 1907, Rockefeller increased the wages given to workers at Golf House from $1.50 to $1.65 per day, as he was having difficulty obtaining enough workers to perform the improvements he had planned to the property, which included building as much as three miles (5 km) of new roads and planting 1,000 evergreen saplings around the golf course. Only residents of New Jersey were hired and all applicants required a reference from someone known by William Foerster, Rockefeller's superintendent. The prevailing wage for laborers in the area had been $1.50 per day, and The New York Times described that the 10% wage increase Rockefeller offered would put pressure on other area employers, such as George Jay Gould I, to match the higher amount.Staff. \\"ROCKEFELLER RAISES WAGES.; Needs More Men to Improve His Lakewood Golf House Estate.\\", The New York Times, March 27, 1907. Accessed December 23, 2008. Rockefeller's summer retreat was 30-room, 20-bathroom, three-story mansion wrapped with glass-enclosed porches. The estate included a dairy, sheepfold, woodland, and a 9-hole golf course. Rockefeller and his household would spend spring and sometime parts of the summer at Lakewood. Sale to Ocean County Rockefeller Sr. had lived in the Golf House estate during the spring and fall until he died in 1937. In 1925, the property was sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., with his father leasing the property thereafter. It was reported that Rockefeller, Jr. had paid $3,068,000 for the property. As of May 1938, The New York Times reported that the house had been on the market for more than a year at a price of $250,000 but that there were no serious offers despite many visits from prospective buyers. In 1934, the property's value was estimated at $1 million.Staff. \\"ROCKEFELLER ESTATE STILL AWAITS BUYER; Lakewood Home Being Offered for About $250,000\\", The New York Times, May 22, 1938. Accessed December 23, 2008. When John Rockefeller died in 1937, his son John D. Rockefeller, Jr. discussed putting the estate up for sale. Unable to find a buyer after a few years, John Jr discussed with the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County the possibility of the county taking over the property. On April 17, 1940 the Board of Freeholders formally accepted the property and the park opened on August 27, 1940.Rose, Kenneth W. \\"JOHN D.

Using radiolabeled isotopes, difenacoum (and/or its metabolites) has been shown to be distributed across many organ tissues upon oral ingestion, with the highest concentrations occurring in the liver and pancreas. Difenacoum has been shown to be highly toxic to some species of freshwater fish and green algae despite the fact that difenacoum is weakly soluble in aqueous solutions.

As of February 24, 2010 ergocristine has been federally scheduled. Because of the existing Controlled Substance Act regulatory controls on the LSD precursors lysergic acid, lysergic acid amide, ergotamine, and ergonovine, clandestine laboratory operators have sought uncontrolled sources of precursor material for the production of LSD. This has led to the illicit utilization of the precursor chemical ergocristine as a direct substitute for ergotamine and ergonovine for the illicit production of LSD.

An Australian pioneer family leases a piece of land from the government in the Australian outback in 1900 and hires two inexperienced British men as drovers. Problems with local Aboriginal people arise over the possession of a waterhole. Much of the film was shot on location in the Flinders Ranges in South Australiahttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042253/locations accessed 25 September 2011 Plot In the early 1900s, Wally King travels 600 miles to outback South Australia to occupy land he has leased from the government. He is accompanied by his wife Ma, children Emma and John, and friends Tommy and Mac. Despite warnings from a local trooper, the bigoted King clashes with an Aboriginal tribe who depend on water located on what has become the family's property. Relations with the local Aboriginal people deteriorate to the point where John King is speared. The Kings are in danger of being killed by a raiding party but they are rescued by the trooper and his men. A compromise is reached where the Kings agree to work with the Aboriginal people running a sheep station. Cast *Tommy Trinder as Tommy *Chips Rafferty as Wally King *Gordon Jackson as Mac *Jean Blue as Ma King *Michael Pate as Trooper *Charles 'Bud' Tingwell as John King *Nonnie Piper as Emma King *Nicky Yardley as Charlie *Henry Murdoch as Blackjack DevelopmentPepper Trees'= Following the success of The Overlanders, Ealing Studios decided to make a series of movies in Australia. The first one was Eureka Stockade. In October 1948 Ealing announced they would follow Stockade with Pepper Springs, a comedy about new immigrants to Australia. It would be written and directed by Ralph Smart, who had made Bush Christmas, and star Chips Rafferty and Tommy Trinder. Filming would begin in March 1949. They hoped to cast Gordon Jackson as the third lead and an Australian girl in the female lead part. It was intended to follow Pepper Springs with Robbery Under Arms. In November 1948 a columnist for the ABC Weekly said he had \\"read the story of Pepper Trees\\" and that it \\"Should be an amusing vehicle for Trinder, Rafferty, Gordon Jackson, and an unchosen girl. But I'm betting Tommy and Chips will want their parts built up. In the rough, the girl could steal the picture.\\" By December there was some doubt if Trinder would make the movie. In January 1949 Ealing announced that instead of Pepper Trees, Rafferty and Tommy Trinder would appear in a \\"light comedy\\" called Bitter Springs. =Bitty Springs= The film was the idea of Ralph Smart and roughly based on an apparently true story. This was the third movie Ealing Studios made in Australia following the success of The Overlanders (1946). It was originally announced as a comedy starring Rafferty and Trinder, and was meant to be followed by a version of Robbery Under Arms. Tommy Trinder's part was created especially for him to ensure the movie had some comic relief. Nick Yardley had previously appeared in Ralph Smart's Bush Christmas. Nonnie Piper was a 19-year-old model. The original script ended with the massacre of Aboriginal people at the hands of the white settlers, but this was changed at the insistence of Ealing Studios. Ralph Smart scouted around Australia for locations and at one stage it seemed that the film would be made in Murgon, Queensland but eventually it was decided to make it in South Australia. Writer Dave Moore flew out to Australia to help with the script.Variety April 1949 Shooting Filming started in May 1949. Location shooting was completed in November, nearly two months behind schedule due to rain delays, and was followed by two weeks at Pagewood Studios in Sydney. 130 Aboriginal people were used as extras. They had nowhere to stay when they arrived due to an administrative oversight and their treatment on set was criticised. Ealing wanted to pay Aboriginal actor Henry Murdoch the same as white actors but the Department of Native Affairs refused, only granting him a regular allowance. During filming a man went around Adelaide pretending to be a talent scout for the film offering women the chance to appear in it. Leslie Norman is credited as associate producer. He later recalled \\"I went out [to Australia] as a sort of hatchet man. It was a shame, but that film was awkward, a bit stiff and staid.\\"Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema, Metheun 1997 p440 Release The film had its world premiere in Adelaide, which was attended by Don Bradman. Although reviews were generally respectful the film was a box office disappointment on release and Ealing abandoned its plans to make further movies in Australia. (During filming, in June 1949, Ealing said that Ralph Smart would make Robbery Under Arms afterwards.) It sold off Pagewood Studios in 1952.Philip Kemp, 'On the Slide: Harry Watt and Ealing's Australian Adventure', Second Take: Australian Filmmakers Talk, Ed Geoff Burton and Raffaele Caputo, Allen & Unwin 1999 p 145-164 Filmink magazine said \\"It's weird that Ealing Films thought this movie would be commercial‚Ä¶ maybe they had visions of something like Cimarron, only there's hardly any female characters in it... In the filmmakers‚Äô defence, their hearts were in the right place and at least the film tries to tackle head on some of the issues of Australian settlement. And I actually think it could have found an audience had the filmmakers told the story from the point of view of female characters, like the later We of the Never Never. But Ealing, for all their progressive politics, were lousy at making films with female protagonists.\\" See also *Cinema of Australia ReferencesExternal links * *Bitter Springs at Australian Screen Online *Bitter Springs at BFI Screenonline *Article on Bitter Springs at Senses of Cinema *BFI film info *Bitter Springs at Oz Movies *Review of film at Variety Category:1950 films Category:British films Category:British Western (genre) drama films Category:British historical films Category:Australian films Category:1950s Western (genre) drama films Category:1950s historical films Category:English-language films Category:Australian Western (genre) drama films Category:Films set in South Australia Category:Films shot in Flinders Ranges Category:Films set in 1900 Category:Films directed by Ralph Smart Category:Ealing Studios films ","title":"Bitter Springs (film)"},{"id":"20813550","title":"Gr√®s sup√©rieurs Formation"},{"id":"20813566","text":"Boundary cells (also known as border cells or boundary vector cells) are neurons found in the hippocampal formation that respond to the presence of an environmental boundary at a particular distance and direction from an animal. The existence of cells with these firing characteristics were first predicted on the basis of properties of place cells. Boundary cells were subsequently discovered in several regions of the hippocampal formation: the subiculum, presubiculum and entorhinal cortex. thumbFiring of a boundary cell recorded in rat subiculum in 1 x 1 metre square-walled box with 50 cm-high walls. A 50 cm-long barrier inserted into box elicits second field along north side of barrier in addition to original field along south wall. Left: Firing rate map, one of 5 colours in locational bin indicates spatially-smoothed firing rate in that bin (autoscaled to firing rate peak, dark blue: 0-20%; light blue: 20-40%; green: 40-60%; yellow: 60-80%; red: 80-100%. The maximum firing rate is 14.2 Hz). Right: path taken by rat is shown in black, locations where spikes were recorded indicated by green squares. O'Keefe and Burgess had noted that the firing fields of place cells, which characteristically respond only in a circumscribed area of an animal's environment, tended to fire in 'corresponding' locations when the shape and size of the environment was altered. For example, a place cell that fired in the northeastern corner of a rectangular environment might continue to fire in the northeastern corner when the size of the environment was doubled. To explain these observations, the Burgess and O'Keefe groups developed a computational model (Boundary Vector Cell - or BVC - model) of place cells that relied on inputs sensitive to the geometry of the environment to determine where a given place cell would fire in environments of different shapes and sizes. The hypothetical input cells (BVCs) responded to environmental boundaries at particular distances and allocentric directions from the rat. Separate studies emerging from different research groups identified cells with these characteristics in the subiculum, entorhinal cortex and pre- and para-subiculum where they were described variously as \\"BVCs\\", \\"boundary cells\\" and \\"border cells\\". These terms are somewhat interchangeable; the critical defining functional characteristics of associated with the different labelling schemes are rather arbitrary and any functional differences in cells found in different anatomical regions are not yet fully clear. For example, neurons classified as \\"border cells\\" may include some that fire at short range to any environmental boundary (regardless of direction). Additionally, the BVC model predicted the existence of a small proportion of cells with longer range tunings (i.e., firing parallel to, but at some distance from boundaries) and few such cells have been described to date. In general, although the general predictions of the BVC model regarding the existence of geometric boundary sensitive inputs were confirmed by the empirical observations it prompted, the more detailed characteristics such as the distribution of distance and direction tunings remain to be determined. In medial entorhinal cortex border/boundary cells comprise about 10% of local population, being intermingled with grid cells and head direction cells. During development MEC border cells (and HD cells but not grid cells) show adult-like firing fields as soon as rats are able to freely explore their environment at around 16-18 days old. This suggests HD and border cells, rather than grid cells, provide the first critical spatial input to hippocampal place cells.

History It was established by an act of the Parliament of Botswana, Act no. 12 of 2015 as a Parastatal under the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food Security (MoA). The BUAN act repealed the BCA Act no. 9 of 1991. BCA took over from the Botswana Agricultural College (BAC) which was abolished on coming into effect of act No.9 establishing BCA into its place. The BCA was a parastatal under the Ministry of Agriculture and an associate institution of the University of Botswana (UB). As an associate institution, it offered UB higher diploma and degree programmes in agricultural sciences. On the 27th August 2013, the Government of Botswana approved that the then Botswana College of Agriculture should transform into a university of agriculture and natural resources through Presidential Directive CAB 21 (B)/2013. The decision was in line with the college's Strategic Plan of 2009-2016 that had a vision to transform into ‚ÄúAn Agricultural University of international repute\\". The process of transformation was inaugurated when the, then Ministry of Agriculture announced the Government's decision at a ceremony at the Sebele campus on the 12 November 2013.

Outcrops of the Kirkwood are also found along the Worcester-Pletmos, Herbertsdale-Riversdale, Heidelberg-Mossel Bay, and Oudtshoorn-Gamtoos basin lines. At these basins the Kirkwood Formation underlies the Buffelskloof Formation and not the Sundays River Formation.John Pether (April 2014) Extension of quarrying on Portion 12 of Farm Hartenbosch 217 (Maandagskop Crusher), Mossel Bay, Western Cape. Brief Palaeontological Assessment (Desktop Study). Link:http://www.phsconsulting.co.za/uploads/7593872PIA%20Brief%20Maandagskop.pdf  Geology  The Kirwood Formation was formed along the southern section of South Africa during the break up of Gondwana. Dating it has proven tricky, with some regarding it as a Late Jurassic (~145 Ma). or Early Cretaceous deposit (~135 Ma). However, dating the Kirkwood's abundant volcanic ash layers by U-Pb methods is currently underway. The Kirkwood Formation is composed of sedimentary rocks deposited under fluvial conditions at or near sea level, such as variegated mudstone (an iconic feature), medium-grained lithic sandstone (often being charcoal-rich), and sporadic conglomerates. At its base, the Kirkwood Formation includes a significant deposit of fine-to-medium grained, poorly-sorted (often quartzitic) estuarine sandstone with subordinate dark grey to brow shale layers. This deposit was described as the Swartkops Member. The lower portion of the remainder of the Formation is composed predominantly of siltstones, but includes a smaller sandstone layer (described as part of the Bethelsdorp Member). The upper portion of the Formation is composed predominantly of fine, clay-rich mudstones, with multiple smaller layers of estuarine sandstone. The Kirkwood is the second formation of the Uitenhage Group, positioned between the overlying Sundays River Formation and the underlying Enon Formation. Only three geological members have been described within it: the Swartkops Member which contains estuarine sandstone deposits and lacks fossils. The Colchester Member is the most fossil-rich containing terrestrial and lacustrine fossils and is composed of dark grey shale, siltstones and sandstones. The third, the Bethelsdorp Member, resembles the Colchester in containing dark-grey shales and sandstone, and contains marine microfossils. The upper section of the member is overlain by mudstone and siltstone.  Paleontology  The Kirkwood Formation is the most fossil- rich formation of Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous age known in South Africa. It has yielded disarticulated remains of theropod and ornithopod dinosaurs, and several sauropod species in which the Kirkwood is particularly rich. These species include undetermined Diplodocinae, Brachiosauridae, and Eusauropoda. One of the first sauropod species discovered in the Kirkwood was Algoasaurus.\\"Table 13.1,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Page 270 A partial skull and teeth of a stegosaur, Paranthodon, has also been discovered.\\"Table 16.1,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Page 345 Mesozoic-aged amber has also been recovered from the Kirkwood. The most well-known find from the Kirkwood is Nqwebasaurus, a basal ornithomimosaur. Fragmentary remains of various reptile, frog, insect, and mammal fossils have also been found, including fish scales and freshwater bivalves. In addition several plant species such as bryophytes, ferns, conifers, cycads, and bennettitaleans have been discovered, including silicified fossil tree trunks in the sandstone sections which show evidence of being burned.

The book, with product code TSR 9274, was published in 1990, and was written by Scott Bennie, with cover art by Brom and interior art by Valerie Valusek. Contents This campaign setting supplement describes the Old Empires, classical and Egyptian-style realms. The 96-page booklet is wrapped in a removable cover. The book includes a one-page introduction, explaining that this book covers the Old Empires, three ancient kingdoms in the South of the Forgotten Realms world: Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta, each of which receives its own section. Pages 3‚Äì6 detail the history of the Old Empires, including a two-page timeline of important events. Pages 7‚Äì10 briefly describe the lands surrounding the Old Empires, which include Thay, Semphar and Murgh√¥m, Aleaxtis (kingdom of the sahuagin), the Plains of Purple Dust, the Coastal Cities, Aglarond, Raurin, Durpar, Veldorn, Eastern Shaar, and Chondath. Mulhorand (pages 11‚Äì34) describes Mulhorand's people and society, geography, current economy, current politics, laws, adventures, religion, personalities, culture, and technology. Unlike the typical deities of the Forgotten Realms, the people of Mulhorand worship the gods of Egypt, such as Isis, Thoth, and Osiris. Unther (pages 35‚Äì49) describes Unther's people and society, geography, religion, personalities, and culture. The people of Unther primarily worship the gods of the Sumerians, including Ishtar and Ramman. Chessenta (pages 50‚Äì64) describes Chessenta's people and society, geography, current economy, current politics, religion, personalities, mercenary companies, and culture. Pages 65‚Äì70 detail several short adventure scenarios appropriate for the Old Empires.

It is exposed along the Peace River near Dunvegan, as well as in the Smoky River area. The formation is part of the Smoky River Group, and is conformably overlain by the Bad Heart Formation in the western area, and unconformably by the Cardium Formation in the Pouce Coupe River area. It is conformable underlain by the Dunvegan Formation. The Kaskapau Formation is equivalent to the Colorado Group shale in central Alberta. It is equivalent to the upper Blackstone Formation, the Cardium Formation, and the Muskiki Formation in the Canadian Rockies foothills in western Alberta.  Lithology  The Kaskapau Formation is represented mostly by dark grey shale, with sandstone tongues and lentils at the base (Doe Creek Member, Pouce Coupe Member). Thin volcanic ash layers may occur in the British Columbia foothills.  Paleontology  Oyster fossils are encountered at the base of the formation, and Inoceramus fragments (such as I. labiatus) are found throughout the entire stack. Ammonites are also present in the sand beds, genus encountered include Dunveganoceras and Watinoceras in the lower part and Scaphites in the upper part.

The tube contains bromadiolone, a second- generation (superwarfarin) anticoagulant. The label in Dutch states, in part: Contains an anticoagulant with prolonged activity. Antidote Vitamin K1. Vitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are a group of substances that reduce blood clotting by reducing the action of vitamin K. The term \\"vitamin K antagonist\\" is technically a misnomer, as the drugs do not directly antagonise the action of vitamin K in the pharmacological sense, but rather the recycling of vitamin K. They are used as anticoagulant medications in the prevention of thrombosis, and in pest control, as rodenticides.  Mechanism of action  These drugs deplete the active form of the vitamin by inhibiting the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase and thus the recycling of the inactive vitamin K epoxide back to the active reduced form of vitamin K. The drugs are structurally similar to vitamin K and act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The term \\"vitamin K antagonist\\" is a misnomer, as the drugs do not directly antagonise the action of vitamin K in the pharmacological sense, but rather the recycling of vitamin K. Vitamin K is required for the proper production of certain proteins involved in the blood clotting process. For example, it is needed to carboxylate specific glutamic acid residues on prothrombin. Without these residues carboxylated, the protein will not form the appropriate conformation of thrombin, which is needed to produce the fibrin monomers that are polymerized to form clots. The action of this class of anticoagulants may be reversed by administering vitamin K for the duration of the anticoagulant's residence in the body, and the daily dose needed for reversal is the same for all drugs in the class. However, in the case of the second generation superwarfarins intended to kill warfarin resistant rodents, the time of vitamin K administration may need to be prolonged to months, in order to combat the long residence time of the poison. The vitamin K antagonists can cause birth defects (teratogens). Vitamin K is used to produce coagulation factors. VKAs interfere with the recycling of Vitamin K epoxide into Vitamin K (step 4 to 1). Coumarins (4-hydroxycoumarins) Coumarins (more accurately 4-hydroxycoumarins) are the most commonly used VKAs. In medicine, the most commonly used VKA is warfarin. Warfarin was initially used as a rodenticide, but made the transition to pharmaceutical. Eventually some rodents developed resistance to it. The \\"second generation\\" VKAs for dedicated use as rodenticides are sometimes called superwarfarins. These VKAs are enhanced to kill warfarin-resistant rodents. The enhancement to the molecule takes the form of a larger lipophilic group to enhance the fat solubility of the poison and greatly increase the time it acts within the animal's body. However, as described above, the superwarfarins do not inhibit vitamin K and their effect is easily inhibited by vitamin K. Nevertheless, oral vitamin K may need to be given for times that may exceed a month (cases have been described needing as much as nine months vitamin K supplementation), in order to counter the effect of second- generation VKAs that have very long residence times in the fat of animals and humans. For a more complete list of coumarins used as pharmaceuticals and rodenticides, see the main article on 4-hydroxycoumarins.

Pindone, chlorophacinone, and diphacinone are used as rodenticides. They are categorised as \\"first-generation\\" anticoagulants, and have similar effects as warfarin. They have been largely superseded by second-generation anticoagulants because warfarin-resistant rodents have become more common. Anisindione, fluindione, and phenindione are oral anticoagulant medicines with actions similar to warfarin. However, the indandiones are generally more toxic than warfarin, with hypersensitivity reactions involving many organs and sometimes resulting in death. They are therefore now rarely used.

Geology of southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan; Geological Survey of Canada, Memoir 163. The formation straddles the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, which divides it into an upper, Early Paleocene member and a lower, Late Cretaceous member. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous portion.Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). \\"Dinosaur distribution (Late Cretaceous, North America).\\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 574-588. .  Lithology  The Willow Creek Formation is composed of non-marine varicolored shales, red beds and sandstones. The shales and red beds include calcite nodules and caliche deposits. The sandstones are soft, light grey, massively bedded and cross-bedded, with harder conglomeratic sandstones toward the base of the formation.Glass, D.J., editor, 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, Alberta,1423 p. on CD-ROM, .  Depositional environment  The sediments were eroded from the Canadian Cordillera, and were transported eastward by river systems and deposited in fluvial channel and floodplain environments. The caliche and red beds reflect deposition under arid to semi-arid climate conditions. This contrasts with the equivalent Scollard Formation north of the Bow River, which includes coal deposits indicative of a more humid environment.  Distribution  The Willow Creek Formation is present in southwestern Alberta, south of the Bow River, and extends a short distance into northern Montana. It thins eastward from the foothills of the Canadian Rockies to its limit east of Vulcan, Alberta. Thicknesses exceeding 1000 meters have been reported.

It was first settled as a transport depot and mining camp around 1863 in what was then the Arizona Territory. History When the first Americans reached the Castle Dome Mountains in the early 1860s, there were already signs of previous mining activity. It was generally held that Native Americans had engaged in mining in the Castle Dome Mountains some years before and backpacked the ore south to a processing site on the banks of the Gila River, where remnants of adobe furnaces were found. As mineral deposits began to be discovered up and down the Colorado River in the early 1860s, numerous mining camps and steamboat ports grew into towns along the river. Heading north from Yuma, prospectors staked gold and silver claims along the river and in the surrounding mountains. The Castle Dome Mining Company, established in 1863 and owned by Conner and Jacob Snively, purchased many of these claims and planned out the site of Castle Dome Landing on the banks of the Colorado River to act as a shipping point for ore on its way to California for smelting. The Snivelys planned only to mine silver in the area, but in that same year, well- known geologist and mining engineer William P. Blake realized that the region's copper-lead ores held extensive value, and lined up investors to develop mining operations in the area. =Castle Dome Mining Camp= Though prospecting and planning commenced years earlier, modern mining in the area didn't begin in earnest until 1869 due to hostilities with Native Americans. When the mines finally did begin operations, the mining camp that sprung up was known as Pitoti after a weed thought to be found only in that area. As the area grew, the town was renamed Castle Dome, and a post office was established in that name on December 17, 1875. Less than a year later, however, the post office was discontinued on December 4, 1876. =Castle Dome Landing= While the mining camp itself went into decline, the nearby riverside landing established some years earlier for steamboats of the Colorado River began to thrive. The landing, setup for transport of ore and as a supply point for the mines some east of the river, provided a new town site for the region, and was soon established as Castle Dome Landing. The post office re-opened under this new name on August 6, 1878, and the small port became an active supply and shipping depot for the mines in the Castle Dome Mountain mining district. For the next six years, Castle Dome Landing served as the first stop for steamboats traveling up the Colorado River from Yuma, and the town thrived, both as a supply and shipping point and as a popular destination for travelers from Yuma who came up the Colorado River for various celebrations held at the numerous river towns. For Castle Dome Landing, Mexican Independence Day on September 16 was the main draw. By some accounts, the population of the town peaked at over 3,000 people, and rivaled Yuma in size as of 1880, almost becoming Yuma County's namesake. Other sources put the full-time residents at only 50. At its peak, it housed a post office, a hotel, a saloon, a general store, and smelting facilities. =Decline= As with many mining boomtowns, mining activity diminished, and the Castle Dome Landing post office closed down on June 16, 1884. The mines reopened in 1890, and the area became a significant source of lead for both World War I and World War II. In particular, when the Arizona Lead Company reopened the mines in 1943, they were able to produce significant amounts of lead in order to meet wartime demands. After World War II, the demand for lead decreased, and the town again went into decline, though mining activity continued for some years in the area. The school was shut down in 1950, and the mines went into and out of use as the price of silver, still found in the area, rose and fell. By 1978, the mines were all shut down, and the last of the residents were gone. Remnants The remains of Castle Dome Landing, once on the banks of the Colorado River, are now submerged beneath the Imperial Dam reservoir in Martinez Lake. The property that was previously Castle Dome town and mining camp was purchased in 1994 by Allen and Stephanie Armstrong, and turned into the Castle Dome Museum.Castle Dome Museum The museum site houses over 50 restored and recreated buildings -- seven original to the town, and the rest are period representations built mostly from locally scavenged materials. Each building, among them a saloon, a hotel, a mill, and a blacksmith, is staged to look like it might have looked in the town's heyday, some 100 years ago. Mining Map of Yuma County, Arizona, Castle Dome Landing highlighted, 1883. Castle Dome Mountains viewed from town of Castle Dome, Arizona, October 11, 1926. Though silver was the original target for prospectors in the area, much of the early excitement over supposed silver deposits turned out to be veins of galena instead. As it turned out, the area was far more rich with lead ore than silver. The Castle Dome mining district is one of Yuma County's oldest and most productive mining locations. Its proximity to the Colorado River and relatively low rates of freight at the time permitted the mining of even low grades of ore which wouldn't have been profitable at other locations. In addition to silver and lead, the area is rich in numerous other minerals, including zinc, copper, gold, and many others. Total production from the Castle Dome mines included of lead, of silver, of zinc, of copper, of gold, and of placer gold production, mostly prior to 1900. The Castle Dome mining district is a popular district for mineral collectors. The region is known for striking combinations of cerussite, fluorite, vanadinite, wulfenite, barite, and mimetite, as well as galenite and anglesite. The Hull Mine and Puzzler Mine in particular have produced atypical green vanadinite and mimetite as well as yellow-hued wulfenite. Geography Castle Dome Landing, now submerged, is located at (32.9650409, -114.4635592) about north of Yuma.

The name Compak Sporting is a protected, registered trademark with a code of sports rules, owned by FITASC (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives De Chasse).  Description  Compak Sporting is a \\"compacted\\" form of sporting clays, which is a shotgun sport usually spread over 12 to 36 stations (shooting areas) occupying around , presenting 2 or 3 different clay targets at each. One shooter will shoot the targets, followed by the next and so on. With Compak Sporting the space requirement is considerably less, and a squad of up to 6 shotgun shooters, (5 actively shooting), will stand in a straight line, each on a marked square (1 meter by 1 meter) and spaced 3 to 5 meters apart (i.e. the shooting line will be 12 to 20 meters long). In front of them will be the \\"target area\\". This is a rectangle 40 meters wide by 25 meters deep and positioned 4 to 5 meters in front of the line of shooters. (If the shooters are numbered 1 to 5, the rectangle will be centered on shooter 3) The target area, a 40 x 25 meter rectangle, should be marked with four flags defining the four corners. Clay targets are thrown by clay pigeon trap machines, of which there must be a minimum of 6. Targets may be thrown from either inside or outside the area, and may land inside or outside it, but every target thrown must pass over at least one side of the target area. Shooters take turns shooting the various targets ‚Äì these can be single targets or double targets (instant pair or report pair). Targets are released on a random time delay (0 ‚Äì 3 seconds) after the shooter's call. There are numerous rules defining compulsory targets, traps, triggering systems, shooting stands, targets, trajectory- setting-tables, guns, ammunition etc.FITASC Compak Rules  Variations  Although Compak Sporting is an international shooting game with defined rules, many other variations of Compact Sporting games have been devised. For a limited shooting area, Compact Sporting can provide a selection of various targets all shot from one \\"station\\". Sometimes called \\"Lazy man's Sporting Clays\\", a Compact Sporting layout can give a wide variety of target presentations without having to walk around a sporting clays course. Another feature of Compact Sporting is that the game can be played from under cover in poor weather conditions.Samples of covered decks Compak Sporting requires a minimum of 6 clay pigeon trap machines, but it is not unusual for Compact Sporting games to use up to 15 trap machines. With the correct design, a covered Compact Sporting deck or platform can be used to host Compak Sporting regulated shooting competitions.

Initially planned to be a V-Cinema release on DVD March 21, 2009, it was announced on December 7, 2008, that it would be released to Japanese theaters on January 24, 2009, to commemorate the fifteenth entry in the Super Sentai VS Series. The film features a team up between the characters of both Engine Sentai Go-onger and its predecessor Juken Sentai Gekiranger. This is the first time that any Super Sentai series has had a film beyond the double-feature with the Kamen Rider Series film during the summer. In its first weekend of release, the film opened at #3 in Japanese box offices and earned the equivalent of US$964,079, showing on 292 screens. Plot The story begins when Geki Red battles Nunchaku Banki after returning from his trip around the world for Natsume's birthday, with Geki Yellow and Geki Blue arriving to provide backup. After sending the Gekirangers into another dimension, the Go-ongers arrive before the Savage Machine Beast departs after his quarry. After clearing a misunderstanding with Geki Violet and Geki Chopper, the two bring them to SCRTC to see Master Xia Fu, with Hant revealing he met Miki at one of his past jobs at the Kyoryuya Curry Shop. After taking Xia Fu to the site, realizing the Gaiark are after D≈çkokugan, he opens the path for them to follow as the Gekirangers are overwhelmed by Nunchaku Banki, who demands the sealed Long from Jyan. After the Gekirangers' reunion and meeting the Go-ongers, they take out the Ugats and overwhelm Nunchaku Banki. In retaliation, he steals the Engine Souls as the Pollution Ministers arrive with the mastermind of their scheme, Meka, who reveals himself as the last of Rinj≈´ Hall's fighters. Using the Engine Souls as his hostages, Meka tricks Jyan in giving up the D≈çkokugan to save the Engine Souls before sending the Rangers back to their world. As Meka pounds the D≈çkokugan into an Engine Soul that is implanted into Nunchaku Banki, the Gekirangers attempt to teach the Go-ongers the ways of the Gekij≈´ken style. Nunchaku Banki arrives to test his new-found power with Meka overseeing it to take in the suffering. The Go-on Wings arrive to take the two trouble makers out of the city before fighting them with what they learned from Gorie. Although he was unable to endure Jyan's teachings, Go-on Red runs to Hiroto and Miu's aid as he battles Nunchaku Banki and gets Speedor back with his newly acquired Engine Ken. After mastering their own Engine Ken style, the other Go-ongers arrive to support Go-on Red and Geki Red while getting back their Engine Souls. After scrapping Nunchaku Banki, the Pollution Ministers retreat to have Meka fend for himself. However, Long breaks from his seal, discarding his robot vessel with intent to get his revenge to be completely free. However, the Go-on Wings arrive with the resurrected Rio and Mele to turn the tables as Long converts Nunchaku Banki into a new form for him in inhabit, Long Banki. While the reds and Rio battle Long Banki, Mere and the Go-on Wings deal with Meka before the teams use a Super-Super Special combo on them. Although Meka is destroyed, Long Banki enlarges with Engine-Oh G9 and Geki Rin Tohja Wolf fighting him; Bae would return all the way from India to give commentary. Although the teams are initially overpowered by the immortal, Engine-Oh G12 and Saidai Geki Rin Tohja are formed and manage to destroy Long Banki with Long resealed. After giving the D≈çkokugan back to Jyan, Rio and Mele depart for purgatory, with Rio telling Jyan he hasn't forgotten his promise. The movie ends with both teams throwing a birthday party for Natsume later that night.

In 1806 Elder's father-in-law, David Quint took over the farm, becoming the first permanent settler. Governor King, the proprietor of the town had three agents, David Quint, then Henry Morgan and finally Abraham Smith, who oversaw the sale of lands and operated his farm and mill in the township. King chose to name the new town Frazier, in honor of his wife, Anne Frazier of Boston, since Kingfield had been named for him. However, the settlers sent in another petition, changing the name to Lexington, in conjunction with Concord, Maine, which had been incorporated in 1826.

Wallace FAICP, AIA, PP (1917 - July 19, 2004) was an urban planner and architect who co-founded, with Ian McHarg, the firm of Wallace Roberts & Todd (WRT). Early career Wallace's career spanned the second half of the 20th Century. Beginning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1953, under Mayor Joseph S. Clark, Wallace led a citywide urban redevelopment evaluation that resulted in the Central Urban Renewal Area Report (CURA), which established a new strategy for overall redevelopment that targeted catalytic actions to strengthen communities and downtown. CURA became a model for several other cities, notably Baltimore, Maryland. In 1957, Wallace moved to Baltimore and headed a team to prepare a plan for the city's ailing central business district, which had not had any major new construction projects since the end of the 1920s. Responding to the need for immediate action, the team designed the Charles Center, a 33-acre mixed-use project that started the revitalization. Approved by Baltimore City voters in a bond issue request for $25 million in the municipal elections of November 1958, the concept was strongly supported by two mayors of the city from different political parties: Democrat Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro, Jr. (1947-1959) and Republican Theodore R. McKeldin, (1943-1947 and 1963-1967), as well as business, commercial and other civic leaders in the Greater Baltimore Committee and the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce. The Charles Center was praised by Jane Jacobs in the journal Architectural Forum as the \\"New Heart for Downtown Baltimore\\", and set the stage for the subsequent Inner Harbor project, a re-development of the city's old waterfront district and the Baltimore Harbor. Wallace returned to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts (now known as the School of Design) as professor of planning and urban design. In 1963, he co-authored, with Ian McHarg, the Plan for the Green Spring and Worthington Valleys, a semi-rural area northwest of Baltimore in the suburban Baltimore County. The key idea in the Valleys Plan was the preservation of the valleys as largely undeveloped open space, and the diversion of development to the surrounding plateaus and to the east of the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (Interstate 83). The plan was praised by Lewis Mumford as \\"brilliantly conceived\\", and was republished by McHarg as a chapter in his book Design with Nature. McHarg wrote in his autobiography, A Quest for Life, that by the 1970s, Wallace was \\"indisputably, the dominant city planner in the United States\\". The valleys northwest of Baltimore remain open and generally rural to this day.  Inner Harbor plan  When Wallace received the assignment to prepare the later Inner Harbor Master Plan, also in 1963, he asked McHarg, architect/landscape architect William H. Roberts and architect/urban designer Thomas A. Todd to join him in founding the partnership firm Wallace McHarg Roberts & Todd (WMRT). With Wallace as partner in charge, the plan established the basic principles for development. Over the next 25 years Wallace and his partners were the designers of all of the Inner Harbor's infrastructure, promenades, piers, bridges and fountains, and the design controls for all private development. By 1980, with the addition of developer James Rouse's \\"festival marketplaces\\" of Harborplace along the promenade, the project had become a well-known urban success story of the 1980s.  Lower Manhattan plan  Following the Inner Harbor plan, Mayor John Lindsay and the City of New York retained WMRT in 1965 (with Whittelsey, Conklin and Rossant as local architects) to prepare a master plan for the moribund Lower Manhattan district. Excavation for the World Trade Center's foundations was underway, and the plan was to prepare a response to the WTC's impact. Wallace developed an urban design and growth modeling procedure that evaluated existing conditions, determined the susceptibility-to-change, forecast the probability-of-change, and proposed a design response. The catalytic idea in the Lower Manhattan Plan (LMP) was to develop a predominantly residential community on land created by filling between the bulkhead and pier head lines at both Hudson and East Rivers, adjacent to the single-use commercial centers. Public walkways would be provided at the water's edge, linked by pedestrian ways to the centers and subway stations. The districts' elevated expressways would be depressed. The LMP won the Municipal Art Society of New York's Honor Award and was published in Progressive Architecture. Over the next decade, the firm developed plans for the central areas of New Orleans, Buffalo in New York, Miami, Orlando, and Jacksonville in Florida, Oakland and Los Angeles in California, and Baltimore's MetroCenter, all employing Wallace's growth modeling method combined with catalytic projects unique to each. The LMP's full public access to the rivers and continuous walkways at the water's edge caught the attention of John Weingart, director of New Jersey's Division of Coastal Zone Management. Part of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, his division had been assigned regulatory control over a -deep coastal waterfront, and he saw the LMP concept as applicable. He retained Wallace Roberts & Todd (after McHarg left the firm) to prepare the plan and develop design guidelines for the , nine-community facility. Mandated for both public and private developers, so far 75% of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is completed or in planning.  Recognition  Wallace received the John Harbeson Award from AIA Philadelphia for distinguished service to the profession in 2002 and the American Planning Association's Distinguished Leadership Award in 2003. He was the author of Urban Planning/My Way, a memoir published by the Planners Press in 2004 that features case studies that examine the evolution of large-scale urban development in the 20th Century. In 2008, both APA Pennsylvania and National APA selected Wallace for the 2009 AICP National Planning Pioneer Award, in recognition of his contributions to the planning profession, as having significantly and positively redirected planning with long-term results. Wallace was also a teacher throughout his career, first at the University of Chicago, then at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught for 17 years.

The plot of Atlus's PlayStation 2 role-playing game Persona 4 is centered on a group of high-school students dedicated to capturing the culprit responsible for the murders and kidnappings that happened in their small town of Inaba starting on April 11, 2011. The case is linked by the TV world, a dimension where the characters use alter-egos known as \\"Personas\\" to defeat the Shadows, beings that represent people's hidden thoughts that killed the first two victims. The protagonist is Yu Narukami, a high-school student who moved into the town from the city. He is met by Yosuke Hanamura, the son of the local department store manager; Chie Satonaka, an energetic girl with a strong interest in kung fu; Yukiko Amagi, a calm and refined girl whose family owns the local inn; Kanji Tatsumi, a first-year student whose punk reputation hides a softer side; Teddie, a mysterious figure from the TV world who exists in the form of a cartoonish bear costume; Rise Kujikawa, a popular teen idol who has taken a break from showbiz; and Naoto Shirogane, a well-known junior detective. Persona 4 has been adapted to a manga and an anime series that gave different portrayals to the game's cast, most notably the protagonist who is given his own name and a personality. The game was also ported for the PlayStation Vita and PChttps://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1271871379638378497 as Persona 4 Golden which expanded various of the characters' stories and included a new one called Marie, a teenage girl linked with the Investigation Team. A fighting game sequel, Persona 4 Arena, features the Investigation Team in a tournament competing against each other as well as characters from the prequel Persona 3. Shigenori Soejima acted as the art director for the game and was responsible for the character design. The general approach to designing the characters and ultimately the setting of the game was by drawing from the memory and interpretation of the development staff about a \\"rural, countryside\\" setting. Reception of the game's characters are mostly positive, with various characters having been reviewed favorably. This included the characters' realistic personalities and the relationships established across the game. The English voice acting work was also met with a similar response. Creation and design Shigenori Soejima was in charge of designing the characters in Persona 4. With the series now taking place in a fictional rural town rather than a city like in the prequels, the characters with origins from the city had hair styles different from those in Inaba with 1UP.com commenting that Yu's and Yosuke's were more stylish. The non-player characters with whom the player forms Social Links, a game mechanic wherein the player fosters friendships with the characters to unlock more powerful Personas, had no models in their creation, but Soejima had vague memories about their actions based on his experience when first hearing the ideas. However, as a result of adding the mystery element in the game, the staff decided to make the characters act like real people. Therefore, none of them acted in a stereotypical fashion with director Katsura Hashino stating that this was since \\"the worldview was already pretty far from the ordinary.\\" Each player character's \\"Shadows Selves\\" are meant to act out-of-character in their first scene as a result of appearing in the Midnight Channel. While in this state, the Shadows entertained the audience watching the program; when the player encounters the real person with their respective Shadow Self, they behave more coherently. This resulted in the portrayal of one of the more popular character's shadow, Kanji's, to behave in a stereotypically gay manner. At the same time, it also revealed more about his person as a whole. No changes were made to these scenes as they were meant to \\"depict the contrast between what people appear to be and how they really are.\\" Investigation Team members The playable characters are part of the investigation team in charge of finding and solving the case of murders and kidnappings happening in Inaba. Upon entering a dimension labeled as the \\"TV world\\", they search for the victims and use their Personas to defeat possible enemies. Towards the end of the game, the Investigation Team is re-identified as when they seek out the reasons behind the murders and kidnappings. =Yu Narukami= :Voiced by (English): Johnny Yong Bosch Voiced by (Japanese): Daisuke Namikawa The protagonist is the main player- controlled character of Persona 4. In the anime and most other materials, his name is , while the manga named him . However, in both the original game and the Persona 4 Golden enhanced remake, as well as in Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, the player can choose any desired name for the character. He is a high school student who moves to the countryside of Inaba to live with his uncle Ryotaro Dojima and cousin Nanako Dojima for a year as a result of his parents working abroad, and attends Yasogami High School where he meets most of the game's cast. Before reaching Inaba, however, he is summoned to the Velvet Room by Igor and his assistant Margaret, who warn him of an imminent catastrophe that is about to arrive in his destiny, and that he will have to solve a great mystery within that year, or, otherwise, his fate would have been marked in negative. Yu has no spoken dialogue in the game following the tradition of the Megami Tensei games, his only speech occurring during battle. The Protagonist owns the Arcana of The Fool, the same one shared by his initial Persona Izanagi („Ç§„Ç∂„Éä„ÇÆ) and the Wild Card (which allows him to be able to utilize more than one Persona), but during the battle against Izanami he receives, from the union of the strong bonds he has created, the Arcana of \\"The World\\" that allows the evolution of its original Persona, Izanagi, into Izanagi-no-Okami. His entire personality is decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, Soejima designed him to look more ambiguous than the Protagonist in Persona 3. His character design stayed relatively similar to the initial conception, with his tone and expressions changing the most. In order to emphasize his being from a city, Yu was given a distinct stylish haircut to contrast Inaba's citizens. =Yosuke Hanamura= :Voiced by (English): Yuri Lowenthal Voiced by (Japanese): Showtaro Morikubo is a teenager who moved to Inaba a year before Yu and whose father is the manager of Inaba's Junes Department Store. In order to emphasize his origins from the city Shigenori Soejima gave him accessories such as headphones and a bicycle as well as a stylish haircut. Little changes were made to his design in the making of the game. Befriending Yu shortly after the game's beginning, Yosuke is shocked to find that his friend Saki Konishi becomes the second victim from Inaba's murders. Noticing clues between the victims and the Midnight Channel, Yosuke and Yu go to the TV world to investigate her death. He ends up confronting his Shadow who represents his resentment of living in a small country town with little to do, as well as his inner wish for something exciting to happen. With help from Yu and Teddie, Yosuke accepts his other self and forms the Investigation Team alongside him to figure out who Saki's killer is. Yosuke's Shadow becomes the Persona , a red-scarved humanoid whose head vaguely resembles that of a cartoon frog decked with shuriken on his hands, as well as bell-bottoms. As the first Shadow, Soejima designed it to make it similar to Jiraiya to convey the fact that Shadows and Personas are the same thing. Yosuke dual wields blades ranging from blunt wrenches to knives to kunai in battle. Throughout the player's interaction with Yosuke, he overcomes Saki's death and confronts his feelings about Inaba accepting it as an enjoyable town despite his initial feelings. After this, Jiraiya evolves into , a humanoid wearing a blue jumpsuit surrounded by a large sawblade with a flame rising from his head. Apparently, unused audio suggests that Yosuke could have been a romance option for the protagonist, but was removed at the last minute for unknown reasons. In the re-release Persona 4 Golden, Yosuke's Persona can evolve once more into , gaining a fireman's outfit, a large afro-like fireball spouting from his head, and sawblades beneath his feet. Yosuke serves as the player's Social Link to The Magician; in the animated series, Yu's friendship with Yosuke is signified by Yu's use of . During the events of Persona 4 Arena, Yosuke is now a third-year student at Yasogami High School and he begins to hear rumors that the Midnight Channel is back. He goes to investigate alongside Yu, Yukiko and Chie, and fights using Jiraiya. He also serves as the main character of the manga Persona 4 The Magician that focuses on his life in Inaba before the game's start. Yuri Lowenthal enjoyed playing Yosuke owing to the large number of events the character goes through despite being initially a comic relief. Takahisa Maeyama portrays Yosuke in the stage play. =Chie Satonaka= :Voiced by (English): Tracey Rooney (Persona 4), Erin Fitzgerald (Persona 4 Arena onwards) Voiced by (Japanese): Yui Horie is an upbeat girl with an obsession with kung fu, even using those techniques in battle. Although initially reluctant, she goes into the TV world when her best friend Yukiko Amagi is thrown in, putting her in danger. There, Chie encounters her Shadow who represents her jealousy of Yukiko's feminine side and talents, as well as her wish and need to maintain control over Yukiko. With Yu's and Yosuke Hanamura's help, Chie confronts her other self and joins the Investigation Team. Following the encounter with her Shadow, Chie receives the Persona , a muscular female figure wearing a yellow outfit and armed with a naginata, that she uses in combat while she performs kicks. Throughout Yu's interactions with Chie (which can also be intimate), she discovers that she genuinely wanted to protect Yukiko without any underlying selfish motivations. After this, Tomoe evolves into , whose yellow jumpsuit turns black and is decked in silver samurai armor. The desire to protect people eventually inspires her to seek a career as a police officer. In the re-release Persona 4 Golden, Chie's Persona can evolve to a third level to become , which has golden armor and a long flowing cape. Chie serves as the player's Social Link to The Chariot; this is symbolized in the animated series by Yu's usage of the Persona . She is playable in Persona 4 Arena alongside Tomoe Gozen; In Persona 4 Arena, Chie joins Yu, Yosuke and Yukiko to investigate the TV world after seeing the Midnight Channel. When she enters, she is forced to fight her friends as well as a man, Akihiko Sanada. Minami Tsukui portrays her in the stage play. In the designing of the character, various sketches were made with some of them being reminiscent to previous Persona characters. =Yukiko Amagi= :Voiced by (English): Amanda Winn-Lee Voiced by (Japanese): Ami Koshimizu is an elegant, introverted girl, popular within her school. Her family owns a famous ryokan in the city, and Yukiko is always busy preparing herself to take over the business. She is named the next owner of the ryokan and feels oppressed by her expected duties. Despite her elegant appearance, she carries a whimsical side prone to fits of laughter. Yukiko becomes the third victim to be sent to the TV world, where she is confronted by her Shadow who represents her resentment towards having her destiny already chosen for her as inheritor of the Amagi Inn and her desire to be rescued. With help from the Investigation Team, Yukiko accepts her Shadow which becomes the Persona , a pink-colored humanoid with sakura-like wings using a fan as her weapon. She joins the group to find the culprit behind the kidnappings and murders, and befriends Yu, with the option of starting a romantic relationship with him (depending on the player's actions). Yukiko voices her wish to the protagonist to leave Inaba and find a career away from managing her family inn. She eventually changes her mind when she realizes she cannot find the heart to leave the family and employees who supported her. Following such understanding, Konohana-Sakuya evolves into , a feminine, faceless figure with yellow skin and metallic chrysanthemum-like wings. In Persona 4 Golden, Yukiko's Persona can change once more to become , with golden wings, more ornate shields, and long flowing hair. Something that hinders Yukiko's preparations to take over the Amagi Inn is her cooking, which has the effect of turning stomachs: her colleagues in the Investigation Team call this \\"Mystery Food X\\". Chie and Rise are also bad cooks: this is something that distresses Shinjiro Aragaki in Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth. Yukiko represents the player's Social Link to The Priestess. In the animated series, her friendship with Yu is symbolized by Yu's access to the Persona . She also appears in Persona 4 Arena with Konohana-Sakuya. In the game's story mode, Yukiko has become a far more accomplished chef than she was previously, and when she learns that the Midnight Channel has returned, she investigates it alongside her friends. In the making of the character, various designs were made, some of them being drastically different from how Yukiko looks in the game. A younger Yukiko makes an appearance in Persona 3 Portable at the Amagi Inn, when the game's playable characters take a field trip to Inaba. Yukiko is portrayed by Risa Yoshiki in the first stage play and Yumi Sugimoto in the second. =Kanji Tatsumi= :Voiced by (English): Troy Baker (Persona 4, Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 The Animation through episode 1 to 12), Matthew Mercer (Persona 4: The Animation through episode 13 to 26, Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, Persona 4: Arena Ultimax and Persona 4: Dancing All Night) Voiced by (Japanese): Tomokazu Seki is a fifteen-year-old student in the first year of Yasogami High. He is a delinquent who has a reputation as being a bully, and is the center of numerous rumors regarding a confrontation with a local biker gang. As a result, he was initially given the \\"classic gang-style pompadour\\" in the making of his design. The fourth victim to be sent to the TV world, Kanji is revealed to have a complex with his Shadow revealing he hates girls as a result of criticizing his sewing and is more interested in boys. After the protagonist's group comes to save Kanji, he accepts that his Shadow is an important part of his identity, causing it to transform into the Persona Take-Mikazuchi („Çø„Ç±„Éü„Ç´„Ç∫„ÉÅ Take-Mikazuchi) an enormous black robotic humanoid with the design of a skeleton all over his body, and armed with a large bolt shaped like a lightning bolt and will use a metallic chair as his weapon. He, eager to discover the one who kidnapped him, later joins the Investigation Team, and will begin to express more openly his sensitive side to others, and he will also show that he is rather naive and airy, and not a few times will struggle to follow the team's reasoning on the cases; however in the hardest moments he will lift up and spur others, before they can give in and be overcome by difficulties. During his Social Link, he will increasingly confide with the Protagonist and demonstrate the fragile traits of his personality, his desire to go beyond the label which he is branded by other people, and his passion in creating small plushies; in particular he will start making them for a child who will ask him for help because he has lost the doll of a school friend of his. The gratitude that the child manifests for his gesture leads him to sell his puppets in his mother's fabric store. Reached the highest level of his Social Link, Kanji confesses that his father, before dying, had told him that he had to be strong to be a real man, and that was the reason he always acted in a rude and violent manner; in the end, however, he realized that it was not what his father meant, and that to be strong, he must stop lying to himself and act according to his true personality, without fearing the judgment of others. In this way his Persona evolves and becomes Rokuten Maou („É≠„ÇØ„ÉÜ„É≥„Éû„Ç™„Ç¶), a red robotic humanoid, with a flame design on all over his body and pair of long and pointed mustaches, armed with a large sword that resembles fire. In Persona 4 Golden, Kanji's Persona can once again change into Takeji Zaten („Çø„Ç±„Ç∏„Ç∂„Ç§„ÉÜ„É≥), white in color and more robust than the previous forms. His sexual orientation remains ambiguous across the series, with Kanji being first interested in Naoto Shirogane when first meeting her, believing her to be a boy, but is still attracted to her when it is revealed that she is a girl. Atlus prefers to leave the issue of Kanji's sexuality as open to the viewer. Atlus senior project manager Masaru Nanba remarked on how popular the interpretation of Kanji and his Shadow were in the west in an interview with Famitsu in 2013. Kanji's Social Link is represented by The Emperor; in the animated series, his friendship with Yu is symbolized by the Persona King Frost („Ç≠„É≥„Ç∞„Éï„É≠„Çπ„Éà Kingu Furosuto). Youichirou Oomi portrays him in the stage play. =Rise Kujikawa= :Voiced by (English): Laura Bailey (all appearances excluding Dancing All Night), Ashly Burch (Dancing All Night) Voiced by (Japanese): Rie Kugimiya is a cheerful girl and one of the most popular idols in Japan known as \\"Risette\\" ( in Japanese). Supposedly, she had even performed in Iwatodai (the setting of Persona 3) two years in the past, though a blackout implied to be caused by the Arcana Hermit boss ruined that particular concert. However, she quits her job and moves to Inaba to live with her grandmother, tired of the spotlight. Shortly after arriving to Inaba, Rise is kidnapped and taken to the TV world, where her other self is manifested. Rise's Shadow represents her anger at being stereotyped as an airheaded popstar, represented as a sex symbol. When the protagonist and his friends come to rescue her, Rise accepts her Shadow as part of herself, stating she does not have a real self. Immediately after, she gains the Persona , a black humanoid in a white dress with a satellite dish in place of a head, which she uses to help the Investigation Team to stop Teddie's Shadow. In an interview, Atlus's Masaru Nanba noted that \\"Risechie\\" would not translate well into roman letters for the west, and that the French-sounding \\"Risette\\" was chosen instead. This also changed her catchphrase from to \\"Push Risette\\" (as in \\"push the reset button\\"). Recovering from her experience in the TV world, Rise joins the Investigation Team to track the culprit behind the murders in the town, taking Teddie's spot in fights, analyzing enemies and advising her comrades. During Yu's interactions with Rise, she is initially happy for leaving behind the title Risette. However, numerous reminders of her time in the spotlight, a new replacement idol and a letter from her biggest fan, make her regret her departure. Depending on the player's actions, Rise may end having an intimate relationship with Yu. Realizing that Risette is also part of her true identity, she voices her plans to return to her idol job by spring. Following this, Himiko evolves into , a white humanoid with a more complex satellite dish than Himiko. In Persona 4 Golden, Rise's Persona can evolve once more into , gaining a head resembling a telescope instead of a satellite, two more pairs of arms, and green skin. In Golden, Rise also takes more of an active part in battle, enabling her to directly support the party by giving powerful buffs or picking up fallen fighters. Rise is the player's Social Link to The Lovers; in the animated series, her friendship with Yu is symbolized by his Persona . She is also shown to have a not-so-subtle crush on the protagonist, who she simply refers to as Senpai throughout the game, and flirts with him consistently, regardless of social standing. She appears in Persona 4 Arena as a commentator, with an impostor teasing the main characters across the story. She becomes a playable character in the console version of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax using a microphone as her weapon; during these events, her support Persona - Himiko - was transformed for combat during her confrontation with Elizabeth as a result of Rise's resolve to be able to fight on her own. Yuriya Suzuki from Cheeky Parade portrays her in the stage production. = Teddie = :Voiced by (English): Dave Wittenberg (original game), Sam Riegel (all other appearances) Voiced by (Japanese): Kappei Yamaguchi is a strange part-clown, part-bear-like creature, who resides inside the TV world. Learning that somebody has been throwing people in the TV world to kill them, thus causing mayhem, Teddie makes a promise with Yu Narukami and Yosuke Hanamura to find the culprit. Teddie helps the Investigation Team by giving them advice about how to defeat Shadows or track the people who were thrown into the world. As he interacts with the characters, Teddie starts questioning his own existence and grows curious of mankind's habits such as dating girls. In the game Teddie also starts making puns referencing his name. The translation of these jokes to the English version was noted to be difficult by the Atlus staff. In a 2013 interview, Atlus's senior project manager Masaru Nanba stated that the change of \\"Kuma\\" to \\"Teddie\\" in the western localizations was a result of the familiarity of the concept of the teddy bear to American and European players, and specifically noted the change of Kuma's verbal tic of adding his name to the end of sentences to the \\"very\\" to \\"beary\\" change in the English translation. When fighting Rise Kujikawa's Shadow, Teddie seemingly sacrifices himself to save his friends, defeating the Shadow but becoming flattened in the process. After Rise accepts her other self, saying that there is \\"no real me\\", Teddie has an existential crisis; this causes his Shadow Self to manifest, representing Teddie's fear that his existence is superficial and \\"hollow\\". Aided by his friends, Teddie accepts his doubts regarding his existence and his Shadow turns into the Persona , a robotic figure that resembles a rotund red boiler with stubby arms and legs and armed with a tomahawk missile as a pun to the original mythological figure. Afterward, through restoring his body through extensive training, Teddie \\"grows\\" a human- like body inside of him and leaves the TV world. Using his bear suit, Teddie starts working in Junes and living with Yosuke. He also becomes an active member in battle utilizing a claw as his weapon, with Rise taking his place for support. When Yu's cousin, Nanako Dojima, dies after being sent to the TV world, Teddie disappears from the real world. As the group searches for him, Teddie remembers that he was actually a Shadow, one who wanted humans to like him and, as a result, erased his memory and took the form of a cartoonish bear. After Nanako revives, Yu finds Teddie in the Velvet Room, where Teddie reveals his origin as a Shadow and Yu informs him of Nanako's revival. After returning to reality and seeing Nanako, Teddie decides he will stay with the Investigation Team once again despite being a Shadow with Kintoki evolving into , a cartoonish face on a ball with clawed hands at the end of a missile. Following Izanami's defeat and the TV world returning to its original state, Teddie decides he will return to the TV world. In Persona 4 Golden, Teddie gains a new Persona called , which is a stream-lined missile wearing a crown and a long, flowing, star-patterned cape and a rose emblem. Teddie is the player's Social Link to The Star; in the animated series, his friendship with Yu is symbolized by the Persona in Yu's employ. In the sequel Persona 4 Arena and it's followup, Ultimax, Teddie is impersonated by General Teddie as the organizer of \\"P-1 Grand Prix\\" in the TV world, a tournament between Persona- users, while the real one is trapped inside the TV world and seeks to find his friends during the first tournament. Though Teddie had a peaceful day after saving Aigis' sister unit, Larry's during the \\"Grand Prix\\", Teddie was in a middle of working at Junes tonight, only to find out that Inaba is filled with a similar occurrence as the TV World known as the Dark Hour, a set up by General Teddie for his grand scheme behind a new last tournament \\"P-1 Climax\\". He was encountered by his imposter briefly before reuniting with his friends. In the end when a true plan behind \\"Climax\\" is revealed for humanity's destruction, the true identity of General Teddie is also revealed. Teddie is playable alongside Kintoki-Douji. Early designs of Teddie were to feature him as a more serious-looking character. Kappei Yamaguchi reprised his role as Teddie in the stage play. =Naoto Shirogane= :Voiced by (English): Anna Graves (Persona 4, Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Golden), Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (Persona 4 The Animation), Valerie Arem (Persona 4 Arena Ultimax onwards) Voiced by (Japanese): Romi Park is a young detective who moves to Inaba in order to aid the police in investigating the serial-murder case. Although Naoto is female, she dresses in a masculine fashion and everyone in Inaba believes her to be a boy. In an attempt to solve the murder case, Naoto uses herself as bait by appearing on TV and allowing herself to be kidnapped by the culprit. The group follows Naoto to the TV world, where Naoto is confronted by her shadow, who expresses her frustration,at being treated like a child by the police. Naoto explains after Shadow Naoto has been defeated that because ‚Äú‚Ä¶the police department is a male-oriented society[, if] they had the slightest \\"concrete\\" reason to look down on me, no one would need me anymore,‚Äù which is why she had been presenting as male. Once Naoto has come to terms with her feelings, her Shadow turns into the Persona , a robotic humanoid wearing a blue suit jacket that has an insect-like head and butterfly-like wings. Following Naoto's recovery from her time in the TV world, she joins the Investigation Team to find the culprit, having gained clues about his method thanks to her kidnapping, using a handgun as her weapon. Throughout Yu's interactions with Naoto, she regains her passion for being a detective. Depending on the player's actions, Naoto can become intimate with Yu. Naoto also decides that she isn't a detective just to uphold her family tradition, but because she wants to be and thoroughly enjoy it no matter her gender or age. Her Persona then evolves into , a humanoid in a white and blue traditional armed forces dress uniform with a more bird-like appearance. In the game's ending, Naoto decides to stay in Inaba, unsure what to do now that the case is closed. In Persona 4 Golden, Naoto gets the new Persona , whose outfit is red and blue, and has long, flowing blonde hair. Naoto is the character who links the player to Fortune; in the animated series, her friendship with Yu is symbolized by Yu's usage of the Persona . Naoto appears in Persona 4 Arena and its sequel Ultimax along with Sukuna-Hikona. During the story, Naoto investigates Mitsuru Kirijo's group that fights Shadows and follows them to the TV world where they end up becoming involved in the Persona-users fighting tournament twice. Before the occurrence of the second tournament in the day after rescuing Aigis' sister unit, Labrys, Naoto was in a middle of researching relating to Shadow Operatives/S.E.E.S.' involvement histories with Dark Hour and the late-Shuji Ikutsuki at night, but was interrupted by the news from Labrys of Mitsuru's usual team being kidnapped earlier on daylight during their missions, and the second tournament's occurrence turns Inaba into a second Dark Hour area at a same time. Naoto manage to a track a safer landing location for Labrys' new team to land at Inaba before Inaba completely becoming a second Dark Hour area. She had a short encounter with a mysterious culprit named Sho Minazuki (or rather, his half, Minazuki), until Labrys' team arrive on time saving Naoto, then split up to find their missing friends and saving the world from a dangerous outcome planned by Sho and General Teddie. Naoto is also the protagonist of the non- canon light novel Persona X Detective Naoto by Natsuki Mamiya that focuses on one of their works a year after the events of Persona 4 as they investigate the disappearance of one of their childhood friends in Yagakoro City; in this story they awaken a new Persona, . Juria Kawakami portrays Naoto in the stage production. AntagonistsMitsuo Kubo= :Voiced by (English): Kyle Hebert Voiced by (Japanese): Tsuyoshi Takahashi is a juvenile from Inaba who becomes the second suspect the group believes to be behind the murder case after Kinshiro Morooka's death. He makes a pass at Yukiko Amagi at the beginning of the game, and is rejected. He is later revealed to be an isolated student who was expelled from a different high school prior to the beginning of the game. Eventually the group manages to find him in the TV World and save him from being killed by his Shadow during an argument with the Shadow staying quiet. The Shadow takes the form of an unborn fetus that is able to build an 8-bit video game warrior as a barrier. Claiming he was responsible for all murders in Inaba to get people's attention, Mitsuo is taken away by the authorities. Due to the fact the kidnappings do not cease after his capture, the group then comes to the conclusion he was a copycat killer and is in fact mentally unstable. It is later revealed that detective Tohru Adachi is responsible for sending Kubo to the TV world, as Namatame would have stopped sending people into it if he believed that the killer had been caught. =Taro Namatame= :Voiced by (English): Zach Hanks (game)https://twitter.com/ZachHanks/status/970285144048394240, Matthew Mercer (anime) Voiced by (Japanese): K≈çji Haramaki is a council secretary who is married to popular enka singer , fired from his position as a result of his affair with TV reporter Mayumi Yamano, the first victim of the case. Namatame is later revealed to be responsible for sending people to the TV world, using his family's delivery truck to be unnoticed by the victims and hiding a plasma TV inside for transporting them after knocking them out. When kidnapping Nanako Dojima, Namatame is tracked down by Ryotaro Dojima and forced to escape with Nanako to the TV world. There, the Investigation Team confronts him, when he claims he is instead saving people. His Shadow then absorbs several other Shadows to become , a large, angelic humanoid with a gigantic peace sign- shaped halo growing out of its head. Following Kunino-Sagiri's defeat, Namatame is arrested, but the police are unable to build a case due to lack of evidence. The player can trap Namatame in the TV world where his Shadow will kill him as the police would not send him to prison for finding him mentally unstable, which automatically ends the game. If Yu convinces his friends to spare him as they need to learn Namatame's true motives. In reality, Namatame had figured out after Mayumi's death that her appearance on the Midnight Channel had foreshadowed her murder, and he sought out Saki Konishi in order to warn her. After she died as well, Namatame tried to contact the police and Tohru Adachi tricked him into throwing people into the TV to \\"protect\\" them from the killer; after the victims began to turn up alive after his kidnappings, he believed he was truly helping them. Like Yu and Adachi, he was given the power to enter the TV world by Izanami. During the epilogue of Persona 4 Golden, with Kunino-Sagiri revealed to be a splintered fragment of Izanami, Namatame has been cleared of all charges due to lack of evidence and is running for the position of Mayor of Inaba, inspired by the protagonists' work. =Tohru Adachi= :Voiced by (English): Johnny Yong Bosch Voiced by (Japanese): Mitsuaki Madono is a young police officer in the Inaba police department, and Ryotaro Dojima's junior partner. He often accidentally reveals crucial information regarding the investigation to the protagonist, and is constantly reprimanded by Dojima for running his mouth. Following the revelation that Taro Namatame is not the culprit behind the murders and was not aware that the TV world was dangerous until he escaped into it, it is revealed that Adachi is actually behind the two first murders. He became interested in Mayumi Yamano and Saki Konishi until he pushed them into TVs when they spurned his feelings. After the two initial murders, he tricked Namatame into kidnapping people under the idea that he was keeping them from danger, which is reinforced as every person Namatame \\"rescues\\" is then saved by the protagonist's group. He manages to evade suspicion until Naoto becomes baffled at a comment he makes at the site of Dojima's accident and the protagonist realizes that he is the only person in Inaba who cannot be ruled out as a suspect, and he accidentally confirms their suspicions by revealing knowledge of specifics that the police were never privy to. Adachi explains that his reason for his actions is nothing more than to entertain himself and out of disgust for the human world. Adachi uses his handgun in battle. His Persona is , which resembles the protagonist's initial Persona. He is defeated by the party and arrested for his crimes. If the player continues towards the True Ending, the protagonist receives a letter from a recently convicted Adachi, stating his suspicions of a true conductor behind all of the events of the case, providing the investigation team with new insight to their reasoning. It is then revealed he gained his power from Izanami like Yu and Namatame. During the epilogue, Adachi's trial has yet to start but he still gets in contact with Dojima in his cell. In Persona 4 Golden, Adachi is added as one of the new Social Links the player can build, initially represented by ; at the game's climax, the player has the option of pursuing Adachi as the main culprit, which changes the Social Link name to The Hunger, or in the Japanese version of the Thoth Tarot, or the player can assist Adachi in destroying evidence and allowing him to escape, resulting in the new \\"Accomplice\\" ending. Adachi makes a non-playable appearance in arcade version of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax and becomes playable in the console version with a DLC. During a routine questioning, Sho possesses the detective in charge of Adachi's investigation and uses him to rescue Adachi from prison, throwing him back into the TV world to help him destroy the world by collecting persona fragments and using them to release Hino-Kagutsuchi, a malevolent and powerful avatar of death. He ends up in a Tartarus-esque version of Yasogami High School, meets Yu and company, and pays lip-service to Sho while secretly working to stop his plan. Adachi eventually makes his move to destroy the crystallized Persona fragment that Sho had captured. He manages to crack the crystal, but is severely beaten by Sho after the latter uses his borrowed power to within an inch of his life until Yu intervenes. Despite being former enemies, Adachi and Yu team up to defeat Sho and Hino-Kagutsuchi, and with the world saved, Adachi returns to his cell and is peacefully visited by his old friend, Ryotaro Dojima. Adachi is portrayed by Masami Ito in the stage play. =Ameno-sagiri= :Voiced by: Ry≈´sei Nakao (anime) , the God of Fog, and the being that was partially influencing Tohru Adachi's actions. Responsible for the fog appearing on rainy days, it takes the form of a gigantic eyeball with a golden disc for an iris and black pipes protruding from its form. It believes itself to pursue \\"mankind's desires.\\" Ameno-sagiri itself is not malevolent, promising the protagonist that it will lift the fog after being defeated, although it is revealed through its final words that it is not dead, but will remain dormant until enough people wish for the fog to return. In Persona 4 Golden, Ameno-sagiri is revealed to be a splintered fragment of Izanami and his essence was absorbed back into his surviving counterparts upon his death. Ameno-sagiri has no known voice actor in both versions, although he does speak through Adachi when he takes control of him after he is defeated by the group. =Izanami= :Voiced by: Karen Strassman is the mastermind behind the events of Persona 4. Claiming that it is what humans desire, she aims to cover the world in dense fog and turn mankind into Shadows, which would cause all humans to only see and believe what they wish were true and cease all suffering. Disguising herself as a Moel gas station attendant, she was able to directly grant outsiders like Taro Namatame, Tohru Adachi and Yu Narukami the ability to enter the TV. She also created the entrance to that world as well as the rumor of the Midnight Channel to see how humans would use it. During the battle, her initial form is that of a goddess, but after she is defeated first time her true form is revealed: a massive, skeletal corpse monster called . Yu defeats her with the power he developed across the game. Following her defeat, Izanami disappears, satisfied with her opponents' abilities. In Persona 4 Golden, Izanami mentions that she is actually one fourth of the original Izanami: . The other fragments of her being became Ameno-sagiri, Kunino-sagiri, and Kusumi-no-Okami. With Izanami's death, her essence returns to her sole surviving counterpart Marie. =Hino-Kagutsuchi= :Voiced by: Fumihiko Tachiki is an avatar of death and the malevolent mastermind behind the events of the Persona 4 Arena series. Born out of the fog that covered Inaba in Persona 4, Hino-Kagutsuchi is the personification of humanity's collective selfishness. Hino-Kagutsuchi is the one who threw Labrys in a Midnight Channel after tampering with her memories in a bid to lure both the Investigation Team and the Shadow Operatives into the TV world. When that eventually fails, he manipulates Sho Minazuki into collecting Persona fragments, appealing to the boy's memories of abuse under Shuji Ikutsuki and desire to destroy the world, and uses the Minazuki half as his direct vessel. Hino-Kagutsuchi can assume any other Shadow versions of the Investigation Team and Shadow Operatives, except for those of Adachi, Fuuka, Marie, and the Velvet Room assistants, though his most common disguise in Ultimax is \\"General Teddie\\" - a shadow version of Teddie from the main game. In both the main game and the downloadable Adachi chapter, once most of all Persona fragments are collected, Kagutsuchi attempts to kill Yu, but was stopped by Minazuki when he begins to suspect Kagutsuchi's motives. Kagutsuchi possesses Sho's body and kills Minazuki, intending to destroy the world until he is the only one who remains, revealing his true gigantic fiery form, but is ultimately destroyed by the combined attacks of Adachi and Yu, and freeing Sho, yet losing his Minazuki-half in exchange to be able to access his half's Persona, Tsukuyomi. Non-player charactersRyotaro Dojima= :Voiced by (English): JB Blanc Voiced by (Japanese): Unsh≈ç Ishizuka is Yu Narukami's uncle (younger brother of Yu's mother) who works as a detective on the Inaba police force mostly alongside the rookie Tohru Adachi. Dojima is Nanako's hard-working single father, but mostly spends his time away from family due to the murders. When Yu starts getting related with the incidents, Dojima starts questioning him, but wishes to avoid doubting him. Nevertheless, he comes to appreciate him as another member of his family. While interacting with him, Dojima reveals his obsession with a hit-and-run accident that killed his wife and continues to investigate it, to the point where he neglects his daughter. Dojima later realizes he was scared of seeing Nanako who reminds him of his late wife, and decides to spend more time with his family. However, he still continues to search for Chisato's killer, but as his duty as detective. Dojima also makes an appearance in Persona 4 Arena having dinner with his family following Yu's return to Inaba. Dojima represents the protagonist's Social Link to The Hierophant, and this is symbolized in the anime adaptation by Yu Narukami's usage of the Persona . Dojima is portrayed by Masashi Taniguchi in the stage play. =Nanako Dojima= :Voiced by (English): Karen Strassman Voiced by (Japanese): Akemi Kanda is the young cousin of Yu, and Dojima's only daughter. Nanako is a guileless girl, and is usually left at home due to her father's work. Nanako is capable of taking care of herself. When Yu starts spending the day with her, Nanako starts calling him \\"Big Bro\\" after Chie jokingly called him that. During her talks with Yu, Nanako worries about whether her father loves her or not due to the little time he spends at home and her mother's death. Yu helps Nanako come to terms with her father's busy professional life, realizing that he also missed her mother as much as she did. Late in the story, Nanako is kidnapped by Taro Namatame and placed into the TV world. During the investigation of Namatame, Nanako passes away for reasons unknown to the doctor; Yu is then forced to choose between exacting revenge on Namatame or sparing him.

She seems very composed and dignified at first glance, although she actually has a silly and whimsical sense of humor. In the second playthrough, Margaret challenges Yu's team to fight her using multiple Personas, wanting to discover for herself the reason why her sister abandoned her role in the Velvet Room. Following her defeat, Margaret reveals Elizabeth's wish to save the protagonist of Persona 3 and claims that she would do the same for Yu.

Marie is also the focus of a new Social Link side story, the Aeon Arcana, a Major Arcana of the Thoth Tarot, in which Yu shows Marie around Inaba and introduces her to his friends and which is indicated in Persona 4: The Golden Animation by Yu Narukami's ability to summon the Persona Kaguya Hime („Ç´„Ç∞„É§„Å≤„ÇÅ). During the Social Link, Marie shows Yu the only hint from her past: an old bamboo comb she is sure belonged to her. After Yu and his friends defeat Ameno-sagiri, Marie vanishes from the real world; if the player does not find her after too long, she will be erased from everyone's memories. In an old cabin near Inaba, Margaret (on a promise to Yu) pulls the entire group through an old TV set, which serves as the only portal to the Hollow Forest, Marie's TV World dungeon. Margaret explains the situation to them: Marie has entered the TV World of her own free will, and that she is going to erase her existence to save the human world. Although initially reluctant, Yu's friends vow to rescue Marie, as she is as much of a friend to them as she is to Yu. When the group finally finds Marie, she reveals that she is , one part of a greater power like Kunino- and Ameno-sagiri; her role was to spy on the real world for Ameno-sagiri, and absorb the TV world's fog from the real world if the two Sagiri were defeated.

After Izanami-no-Okami's defeat, she reveals that she was one of two halves of Izanami, ; Izanami-no-Okami was the half that granted people's wishes, while Izanami-no-Mikoto was the half that actually thought of the good of people. Over time, Izanami-no-Okami's intentions began to diverge from Izanami-no-Mikoto's; as a result, the latter lost all of her power and memories, becoming a \\"shard\\". When Yu confronts Izanami (the gas station attendant), given that the player had saved Marie in time, Izanami will briefly mention Marie, calling her pathetic for holding onto the bamboo comb (combs are seen as a symbol of separation). After Izanami's defeat, Marie apparently vanishes along with her, as she is absent for Yu's departure at the end of the year. However, when Yu returns to Yasoinaba in summer, she reappears in the real world as a weather forecaster, taking on the stage name . In the ending, she will proclaim her love for Yu on TV while the main group watches on, much to their disbelief and Rise's outrage. At the end of the credits, she can be seen in a photograph together with the rest of the main characters. Marie makes a playable appearance in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, available as downloadable content. She meets up with Yu before the other Investigation Team members meet him. When Kagutsuchi covers Inaba with a red fog, Marie assists the Investigation Team and Shadow Operatives to end Hi-no-Kagutsuchi's reign. In Ultimax, Kaguya Hime has now become Marie's Persona.

She is also in charge of delivery, acting as the Investigation Team's \\"catering service\\" in some episodes. A running gag is that she will deliver anywhere and at any time, regardless of the customer's circumstances. This first occurs in episode 6, when she delivers two orders of to Chie while the four are being chased by Kanji (much to Yosuke's disbelief). She also seems to appear in any restaurant that the group goes to, such as when she takes part-time jobs in Tatsumi Port Island and the Amagi Inn.

Labrys was created in 1999 at the Kirijo Ergonomics lab and most of her development was done through painfully forcing her to fight other models of her series. She grew close to one of her sisters, #024, but was forced to destroy her too. After disappearing from Mitsuru Kirijo's plane, she appears in the TV world during the events of the P-1 Grand Prix tournament.

In the manga Aigis starts to refer to her as her older sister. During the story mode, it is revealed that the who hosted the tournament is actually Labrys' Shadow in disguise. The player leads Labrys to face her other self, which represents her desire to live like a normal human and attend high school. When Labrys rejects her other self's wishes, it becomes a Shadow accompanied by the greater Shadow , which resembles a demonic bull. After the player defeats Shadow Labrys in battle, Labrys accepts her other self and it turns into of the Fortune Arcana, a Persona that shares design motifs with Labrys. She then joins Mitsuru's group to find the real culprit behind the P-1 Grand Prix. In the video games, she initially was released solely as a boss character in the arcade versions of P4U.

In Persona Arena Ultimax, Labrys is the protagonist in the Persona 3 Chapter. =Sho Minazuki= :Voiced by (English): Todd Haberkorn Voiced by (Japanese): Kenichi Suzumura is introduced in the sequel to Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax.

He was one of Shuji Ikutsuki's test subjects like the members of Strega. He was Ikutsuki's favorite test subject, due to his fast progress. As part of Ikutsuki's experiments, Sho was isolated from the outside world and never made any contact with anyone other than Ikutsuki, whom he refers to as his 'father' and even has the same habit of making puns. In one experiment to awaken his Persona through the use of Plume of Dusk, instead of a Persona, another personality called Minazuki, was born. Minazuki's birth resulted in Sho being abandoned by Ikutsuki after the former tried to kill him in attempt to protect Sho. He was the culprit behind Labrys' kidnapping and the P-1 Grand Prix, working together with a malevolent entity called Hi-no-Kagutsuchi. Minazuki agrees to gather the Persona Fragments to fully summon Kagutsuchi, in exchange that he will destroy the world, believing it will end Sho's suffering. When the Persona fragments are gathered and Kagutsuchi was successfully summoned, Kagutsuchi betrays him and possesses Sho's body. After Kagutsuchi's defeat at the hands of Yu and Adachi, Sho is unable to sense Minazuki within him, but is now able to independently summon his Persona. After being defeated by Yu one last time, he is inspired by the power of Yu's bonds and leaves to start his own journey, vowing to kill Yu the next time they meet. Sho and Minazuki have two contrasting personalities. Sho is a flippant, hot-headed, and anxious young man with vicious streak, while Minazuki is cold and calculating with no care for the well-being of others except Sho. Sho's past causes him to view bonds and such as meaningless, viewing friendship and such as nothing but licking each other's wounds. But it's later revealed that he is simply lonely and doesn't know how to understand people due to his previous isolation. Sho does not possess a Persona, though he is still capable of matching a Persona user using nothing but his own (practically superhuman) physical abilities of the Sun Arcana. But Minazuki has a Persona named of the Moon Arcana, and he also appears as the final boss in the game's arcade mode with a Persona. =Zen and Rei= :Voiced by (English): Keith Silverstein (Zen), Ashly Burch (Rei) Voiced by (Japanese): Y≈´ki Kaji (Zen), Kaori Nazuka (Rei) Zen and Rei are amnesiacs encountered in Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth: they are residents of a mysterious haven in the rift which takes the shape of Yasogami High (part of the setting for Persona 4), and due to story events do not appear in any other Persona title involving the members of SEES or the Investigation Team. Zen is a taciturn young man who is unfamiliar with people's habits and has a tendency to take things too literally, but is otherwise devoted to Rei's well-being, while Rei is a cheerful and innocent girl who has a strange metabolism that causes her to be forever hungry. Depending on which protagonist was chosen at the start, either SEES or the Investigation Team will encounter them first. If the Persona 3 Protagonist is chosen, then Fuuka locates the first labyrinth somewhere near where the team is gathered by picking up on Shadow signals. However, before they can enter, Zen and Rei appear and interrupt them. Since they intend to enter a maze which doubles as a Shadows' nest, the Protagonist allows them to join SEES for the time being. When they meet the Investigation Team, SEES decides to attempt to restore Zen and Rei's memories as this is their only lead to a way out of the haven in the rift. Zen is later revealed to be a part of Chronos, a being presiding over death, who was sent to take a young girl named Niko who had died of illness to \\"where all life returns\\". At this stage, Rei is abducted and the school's clock tower undergoes a Tartarus-esque transformation, and although Zen at first decides to save her on his own, SEES and the Investigation Team resolve to stay and help him out. Zen uses a crossbow in battle. With this, he can shoot various objects at enemies, such as arrows or bullets. Unlike the other members of SEES, neither he nor Rei possess or are able to use Personas: however, they are capable of fighting Shadows by using an array of battle abilities unique to them.

She is a teenage girl that one day woke up in the movie theater, she is the last person to enter the cinema. At first, she is very shy and quiet, and will have difficulties speaking to anyone that isn't Nagi, another resident of the theater. Her shyness is due to the drauma and depression of her bad past: she was often bullied and made fun of by others for being different, although due to psychogenic amnesia she can't properly remember her past during the game. Unable to cope with the pain of living, she ended up in the Cinema in the collective unconsciousness during a dream, there she meets Nagi, who promesses Hikari to protect her from any harm by isolating her from reality. As our heroes change the endings of the movies, Hikari slowly starts to open up and begins communicating with them, and later in the game. After finishing the third labyrinth, Hikari followes Doe to one of the movies, titled ???, where she faces all of her past traumas, causing her to fully remember her memories and forcing her into a change of heart, revealing the title of the movie being named after her, \\"Hikari\\".

She congratulates our heroes every time they clear a labyrinth, even claiming that she doesn't have a choice. However, near the end of the game, she drops off her guise and reveals herself as Enlil, an administrator of the collective unconsciousness with a delusional and patronizing view towards humanity, believing that they are weak willed and the only way to give them salvation is to trap them inside her cinema domain, putting an end to their thoughts and isolating them from the hardships of life, at the cost of their freedom and increasing their depression even further. After our heroes defeat her, she returns into the form of the black-haired Nagi and vanishes into light, finally acknowledging the possibilities and strengths of humanity, but not before leaving a warning that she will return as long as people wish for her to, finally allowing the party to leave the Cinema. =Doe= :Voiced by: Kazuhiko Inoue is a character introduced in Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth. He is a weird shadow-like figure that is mostly quiet, that one day appeared in the theater, acting as a weird projectionist that would play the same movies over and over again.

Hikari is very afraid of him, and has a lot of trouble communicating or getting near with him, although she starts to become less fearful as the game progresses. After Hikari consensually followed Doe, leading her to ???, she decides to face her own past and so that she can recollect her memories lost from her amnesia. Our heroes, thinking that Doe kidnapped Hikari, they fight him in the deepest part of the labyrinth, after he goes berserk due to Hikari rejecting him. After they defeat him the truth is revealed: Doe is nothing more than a cognition of Hikari's father, created by her due to her depression and low self-esteem, starting to make her develop an inability to differ what is actually harmful to her and what actually isn't. This causes her to develop paranoia towards her father's supposed goodwill that results in the creation of Doe, whom she perceives as a terrifying figure that she could not even get close to. Realizing this, Hikari steps forward and hugs him, as he turns into an image of her father. She tearfully confesses all of her negative thoughts to him, and after the confession, he turns into one of the keys and fades into light. Reception The characters of Persona 4 have received major positive critical response as a result of the players' interactions with them and the themes discussed. The protagonist's role has been noted for allowing the player to build his own \\"self\\" along the game while questioning their own. Various comparisons were made regarding the social interactions from Persona 3 as the development of the social links are relatively faster and more important for the game's battles. The tone was noted be sometimes lighter than in the prequel as it avoided touching depressing themes, but at the same time the character's struggles were much more complex. Additionally, the protagonist's relationships with his relatives who he starts living with were commented for adding more variants to the relationships with these ones focusing on family relationships. Moreover, the inclusion of Shadow versions of the playable characters were praised for the themes they discussed, leading to personal crisis regarding which are their real traits. Kanji Tatsumi's storyline and his ambiguous sexuality received mixed responses, with many fans wishing he could have been portrayed as unquestionably gay with no ambiguity. Naoto Shirogane's storyline also received mixed responses, with some fans taking issue with how the parts of Naoto's narrative that reflect the experiences of transgender people were dismissed and contradicted by canonical insistence that Naoto is a cisgender girl. Characters designs employed in the game were noted to be \\"solid\\" with a clever use of animation for battles. The English voice actors' performance has been noted to be overall good with notes on the quality and delivery of the lines. However, flaws have been found within the execution of certain lines with IGN noting few moments in which some actors did not fit into their respective characters.

The anthology title featured original stories and literary adaptations by writers and artists including Frank Brunner, Howard Chaykin, Gene Colan, Gerry Conway, Richard Corben, Bruce Jones, Gray Morrow, Denny O'Neil, Roy Thomas, and others, as well as non-fiction articles about science fiction and interviews with such authors as Alfred Bester, Frank Herbert, Larry Niven, and A. E. van Vogt, some of whom had their works adapted here. Publication history The black-and-white, science fiction comics magazine Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction ran six bimonthly issues (cover- dated January-November 1975), plus one annual publication, Unknown Worlds Of Science Fiction Giant Size Special Issue #1 (1976). It was published by Magazine Management, at the time the parent company of Marvel Comics, and was cover-branded with the logo of its distributor, Curtis Circulation. Utilizing many Marvel writers and artists, as well as other creators, it was launched following the cancellation of Marvel's 1973-74 comic book SF anthology Worlds Unknown. A framing device throughout the series featured an old curio dealer who presented his shop's visitors with dramas captured in \\"slow glass\\", a concept that series editor Roy Thomas and writer Tony Isabella credited in the magazine to writer Bob Shaw. =Premiere= The premiere issue featured both new material and a number of reprints from fanzines and alternative comics of the era: Writer-artist Neal Adams' \\"A View From Without...\\", from Phase #1 (1971); \\"Smash Gordon in 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Mongo'\\" by writer-artist Frank Brunner, from Heritage #1a (1972); \\"Savage World\\", by writer Wally Wood, pencilers Al Williamson, Angelo Torres, and Roy Krenkel, and inkers Williamson, Torres, and Frank Frazetta, from witzend #1 (1966); and \\"Hey Buddy, Can You Lend Me a...\\", by writer-artist Michael Kaluta, from Scream Door (Asian Flu) #1 (1971). In addition to the \\"slow glass\\" sequences by writer Isabella and penciler Gene Colan, original material included part one of a two-issue adaptation of John Wyndham's novel The Day of the Triffids, by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Ross Andru; and an adaptation by Isabella and Colan of Shaw's original \\"slow glass\\" short story \\"Light of Other Days\\". Comics historian Richard J. Arndt believes the \\"Triffids\\" adaptation was originally scheduled for Worlds Unknown #7-8, the final issues, which had instead deviated from SF adaptations to adapt the contemporaneous film The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974). Arndt also notes, \\"The 'Savage World' story‚Äôs art was done in 1954 for Buster Crabbe Comics but it was unused. In 1966 Wally Wood wrote a new script (the original had been lost) for the artwork....\\" =Subsequent issues= Subsequent issues featured the original stories \\"War Toy\\", by Isabella and penciler George P√©rez (issue #2); \\"Gestation\\" (#3), \\"Kick the Can\\" (#4), and \\"Old Soldier\\" (#6), all by writer-artist Bruce Jones; \\"Encounter at War\\", by Jan Strnad and Richard Corben (#4); \\"Paradise Found\\", by writer Jones and artist Gray Morrow, and \\"Addict\\", by writer Don Glut and artist Virgilio Redondo (both #5); \\"Mind Games\\", by writer-artist John Allison, and \\"Visitation\\", by Glut and Ruben Yandoc (both #6). Thomas succeeded Isabella as framing-sequence writer with the last two issues. Additionally, the magazine reprinted a handful more stories from fanzine and alternative comics, such as Kaluta's \\"The Hunter and the Hunted\\" (#2), from Abyss #1 (Nov. 1970), and Allison's \\"Half Life\\" (#5), from the Canadian publication Orb #2 (1974). Adaptations included Alfred Bester's \\"Adam and No Eve\\", by writer Denny O'Neil and penciler Jim Mooney (#2); Frank Herbert's \\"Occupation Force\\", by Conway and penciler P√©rez; Larry Niven's \\"...Not Long Before the End\\", by writer Doug Moench and artist Vicente Alcazar; and Harlan Ellison's \\"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\\", by writer Roy Thomas and artist Alex Ni√±o (all #3); A. E. van Vogt's \\"The Enchanted Village\\", by writers Don & Maggie Thompson and artist Dick Giordano, Otis Adelbert Kline's \\"A Vision of Venus\\", by writer-artist Tim Conrad, and Robert Silverberg's \\"Good News From The Vatican\\", by Conway and artist Adrian Gonzales under the pen name Ading Gonzales (all #4); Larry Niven's \\"All The Myriad Ways\\", by writer-artist Howard Chaykin (#5); and Michael Moorcock's novel Behold the Man, by Moench and Ni√±o. Interviews with Bester, Herbert, Niven, and van Vogt appeared in issues containing their respective adaptations. A planned adaptation of Robert Bloch's \\"A Toy for Juliette\\", promised in the letters page of issue #3, did not materialize here, although it was eventually adapted by Rick Geary for an independent comic in the mid-1980s. Cover artists included Brunner, Frank Kelly Freas, Michael Kaluta, Michael Whelan, and Sebasti√† Boada, pseudonymously under one of his middle names, Puigdomenech.Note: Arndt misspells \\"Boada\\" as \\"Bodia\\" in issue contents, but spells it correctly in annotations. =Annual publication= The Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction Giant Size Special Issue #1, cover-dated simply 1976,Cover title. The indicia title and issue number are: \\"Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction Vol. 1, 1976\\"; it also, however, lists the price per issue as $1, though the cover price is $1.25 contained the original stories \\"Journey's End\\", by writer Bruce Jones and artist Alex Ni√±o; \\"The Forest for the Trees\\", by Jones and artist Vicente Alcazar; \\"Preservation of the Species\\", by Jones and the mononyn credit \\"Redondo\\" (either Virgilio Redondo or his brother and frequent Marvel contributor Nestor Redondo is uncertain);Arndt believes, \\"The inking for the story 'Preservation of the Species' is clearly Reuben [sic] Yandoc's. It's possible the pencils were by one of the Redondo brothers and, if that‚Äôs the case, the penciler was probably Virgilio Redondo....\\" \\"Clete\\", by writer-artist Jones; \\"Sinner\\", by writer-artist Archie Goodwin, reprinted from witzend #1 (July 1966); and \\"Threads\\", by Mat Warrick and Gonzales. Glut and Yandoc adapted Stanley G. Weinbaum's \\"A Martian Odyssey\\". Don Newton painted the cover. The annual also featured an interview with Theodore Sturgeon, and a reprint, from Worlds Unknown #4, of Conway and John Buscema's adaptation of Fredric Brown's \\"Arena\\". Historian Arndt believes \\"Threads\\", credited to writer Mat Warrick, \\"may actually be by Mal Warrick, a fanzine & science fiction writer of the time.\\" A writer named Mat Warwick published comic-book science fiction in this mid-1970s timeframe in Star Reach. Additionally, \\"Threads\\" was reprinted in the Marvel UK title Star Wars Weekly #3 (Feb. 1978), credited under yet another variant of the name, Matt Warrick.Star Wars Weekly (UK) 3-A at ComicCollectorLive.com. Archived from the original January 25, 2011. Editor Roy Thomas, in an editorial on page 4, dated September 1976, wrote that the series \\"didn't quite succeed in selling the magic number of copies needed to sustain it. No, it didn't lose money ... it didn't make quite enough profit to allow it to be continued. ... Still, in the meantime we had enough material on hand for two or three issues, counting a couple of finished scripts, as yet unillustrated, plus a couple of stories already totally completed.

The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried three above-water twin sets of torpedo tubes; one mount was in the well deck between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other two were between the aft funnel and aft superstructure.

Construction and career Shimakaze, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, was laid down on 5 September 1919, launched on 31 March 1920 and completed on 15 November 1920.Hackett, Kingsepp & Cundall Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to Yokosuka Naval District as part of Destroyer Division 3 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. On 11 October 1928, in Uraga Channel, while on night training maneuvers, Shimakaze collided with her sister ship , resulting in significant damage to her port side, and requiring extensive repairs. During the Battle of Shanghai on 25 September 1937, while engaged in operations on the Huangpu River during the Second Sino- Japanese War, Shimakaze came under fire from troops of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, wounding Destroyer Division 3 commanding officer Lieutenant Commander Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi. From 1938 to 1939, Shimakaze was assigned to patrols of the northern and central China coastlines in support of Japanese combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In December 1938, Destroyer Division 3 was disbanded, and Nadakaze was reassigned to the reserves. =As Patrol Boat No.2= In April 1940, after extensive modifications, Nadakaze was returned to active duty as a No.1-class patrol boat, and renamed . After the start of the Pacific War on 7 December 1941, Patrol Boat No. 2 was assigned to patrols and escort missions in the Philippines, Netherlands East Indies and Solomon Islands. In January 1943, Patrol Boat No. 2 was reassigned to the Japanese home islands, escorting convoys between Moji, Takao, Saigon, Manila and Singapore. In December 1943, the patrol boat became the designated support ship for Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces based in Balikpapan, Borneo. On 25 July 1945, Patrol Boat No. 2 was torpedoed and sunk by the Royal Navy submarine near Lombok Strait, in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Netherlands East Indies at position . The ship was removed from the Navy List on 30 September 1945.

The book was translated into English in 2007. An enhanced, more polished English edition was published by Bazillion Points Books at the very end of 2008. Ollila tells the story of Nightwish from the very first ideas of a band in 1996 until the bombastic concert in Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, after which the lead singer Tarja Turunen was fired in an open letter by the band. The book is based on Ollila's own experiences with the band as well as exclusive interviews with the members, their families and their friends. The book is remarkable as a rock biography both because Ollila's portrayal is very sensitive to the subjects without sugar-coating their foibles, and because he was granted such full cooperation by a still-active band. Lawsuit On November 2009, Marcelo Cabuli, Turunen's husband, filed a lawsuit against Ollila and Like Kustannus Oy, the book's original Finnish publisher, for libel. On December 12, 2011, the Court in the district of Helsinki, Finland dismissed charges of defamation in relation to content of the authoritative book on the Finnish band Nightwish. The Court ruled that the book does not adversely affect Cabuli's work or his reputation in South America. Moreover, the Court determined that \\"Ollila does not portray Marcelo Cabuli in a malicious way.\\" As a writer, Ollila was entitled to report what people familiar with Nightwish said in interviews, said the Court.http://mundotarjista.blogspot.com/2011/12/urgente- marcelo-cabuli-pierde-demanda.html?spref=fb ReferencesExternal links * Nightwish.com * Nightwish-Shop * Amazon.com * Bazillion Points Books Category:2006 non-fiction books Category:Nightwish Category:Biographies about musicians Category:Finnish non-fiction books ","title":"Once Upon a Nightwish"},{"id":"20814673","text":"Tweedy may refer to: *Tweedy (surname) *Tweedy (band), an American rock band *USS Tweedy (DE-532), a U.S. Navy destroyer *Clan Tweedy, a Scottish clan *Tweedy Bird Loc (1967‚Äì2020), American rapper See also * Tweedie ","title":"Tweedy"},{"id":"20814676","text":"This is the discography of American singer-songwriter Will Kimbrough.

The cathedral followed the first Roman Catholic Church in Charleston, St. Mary's, founded around 1800. Construction began in 1850 with the cathedral consecrated on April 6, 1854. It was destroyed on December 11, 1861, in a fire that ravaged much of Charleston. A new cathedral‚Äîthe Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist, built on the same site-was started in 1890. It opened in 1907 and was completed in 2010 with the addition of the long-anticipated steeple. History The first Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston (previously the diocese of the Carolinas and Georgia), Bishop John England (of County Cork, Ireland), originally conceived of the Cathedral. In 1821 he purchased the site of a garden in Charleston called ‚ÄúNew Vauxhall‚Äù. A house was on the lot, and on December 30, 1821, Bishop England blessed it as a temporary chapel and named it in honor of St. Finbar, the patron saint of Cork. He then et about planning and raising funds for a cathedral for the see. However, Bishop England did not live to see the Cathedral constructed. The Right Reverend Ignatius Reynolds succeeded Bishop England in 1844 and oversaw the final construction. Duffy, Patrick Laurence. \\"Charleston.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 February 2020 The Cathedral was designed by Patrick Charles Keely (of County Tipperary, Ireland) in the highly ornate Gothic Style, as a 219-foot-tall structure topped with a steeple and bronze cross. The Cathedral of St. John and St. Finbar was, like its successor the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist, clad in brownstone from Connecticut. Cathedral of St. John and St. Finbar after the Great Fire of 1861 Believing the cathedral's brownstone construction made it fire safe, congregants and neighbors filled the cathedral with their valuables hoping in vain to protect them from the Great Fire of 1861. A week prior to the 1861 destruction by fire, the Cathedral's insurance policy was allowed to lapse. This lack of insurance coverage combined with the realities of the Civil War in Charleston caused the Cathedral ruins to stand for decades unaddressed. The ruins stood until the major 1886 Charleston earthquake caused the remains of the tower to collapse. The fire that destroyed the Cathedral also destroyed the diocese seminary, the first Catholic free school for girls, the diocese 17,000-volume library, the offices of the first Catholic newspaper in the US (The Catholic Miscellany), and countless church documents. The total destruction left the congregation without a home for 29 years until the Cathedral's replacement with the new Keely designed brownstone Gothic style Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist at the same Broad Street location. The original Cathedral was named for the well known St. John the Baptist and the lesser-known St. Finbar. Bishop John England is probably responsible for honoring St. Finbar in the naming of the Cathedral. St. Finbar was the founder of the abbey that became the City of Cork, Ireland. The Right Reverend John England was consecrated in Cork Cathedral prior to coming to Charleston in 1821 and was thus quite familiar with the Irish Saint Finbar. Other than being well represented in the naming of Catholic institutions throughout history, it is not known why St. John the Baptist was honored in the naming. The Gibbes Museum of Art and the Carolina Art Association possess a famous 1868 painting of the ruins of the Cathedral of Saint John and Saint Finbar by William Aiken Walker. There is also a likeness of the Cathedral from April 1854 to December 1861 available in Wikipedia.

The operation included an attack on the headquarters of Erwin Rommel, the commander of in North Africa. It was timed for the night of 17/18 November 1941, just before the start of Operation Crusader. The operation failed as Rommel had left the target house weeks earlier and all but two of the commandos who landed were killed or captured. One member of the Special Boat Section team, who had secured the beach for the commando party, also escaped. Planning From October to November 1941, a plan was formulated at Eighth Army headquarters to attack: (data from Jones 2006 unless indicated) * Rommel's presumed headquarters near Beda Littoria, some inland from Apollonia, Libya * a wireless station and intelligence centre at Apollonia * an Italian headquarters and communications cable mast at Cyrene * the headquarters of the Italian Trieste Division near Slonta Although not specified in the orders, the goal of the raid was to kill or capture Rommel, to disrupt German organisation before the start of Crusader. Rommel's headquarters was believed to be at Beda Littoria, because Captain John Haselden had reconnoitred the area disguised as an Arab and reported that Rommel's staff car came and went from the former Prefecture. The operation was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Laycock; Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Keyes, present throughout the planning stage, selected the most hazardous task of the attack on Rommel's headquarters for himself. Unbeknownst to the planners, Beda Littoria had only briefly been Rommel's headquarters and had been taken over by the chief quartermaster of , General Schleusener. Some weeks earlier, Rommel had moved his headquarters nearer to Tobruk to be close to the action. Rommel was not even in North Africa during Flipper, having gone to Rome to request replacements for supply ships sunk by the British. Raid10‚Äì14/15 November= Submarine HMS Torbay On 10 November, carried Keyes, Captain Robin Campbell, Lieutenant Roy Cooke and 25 men. transported Laycock, Captain Glennie, Lieutenant Sutherland and 25 men from Alexandria. On the night of 14/15 November 1941, Keyes' detachment landed on the beach of (The Dog's Nose), guided by two-man Special Boat Section (SBS) teams in folbots (folding canoes). The beach lay near a place known as Hamama, some behind Axis lines. Once ashore, they made contact with Haselden, delivered earlier by the Long Range Desert Group for reconnaissance. The weather deteriorated and Laycock's group had a much more difficult time getting ashore. Laycock and seven men landed but the rest were stranded on Talisman. With only 34 of the 59 men available, instead of four detachments attacking the targets, there were only to be three. Laycock remained at the rendezvous with three men to secure the beach, Keyes led his detachment of 25 men for the attack on Rommel's supposed headquarters, while Lieutenant Cooke took six men to destroy the communications facilities near Cyrene. Haselden's detachment completed its mission and was picked up by the LRDG. =15‚Äì18 November= Shortly before first light, Keyes' men moved to a wadi, where they sheltered until dark on the second night then moved off. Their Arab guide refused to accompany the party in the deteriorating weather. Keyes then led his men on a climb, followed by an approach march of in pitch dark and torrential rain. Hiding in a cave during the day, the detachment advanced to within a few hundred yards of the objective by 22:00 on the third night. At 23:59, Keyes led his party past sentries and other defences up to the house. Unable to find an open window or door, Keyes took advantage of Campbell's excellent German by having him pound on the front door and demand entrance. They set upon the sentry who opened the door. Campbell shot him and Keyes might have been wounded in the scuffle. The official version is that Keyes opened the door to a nearby room, found Germans inside, closed it again abruptly, reopened it to hurl in a grenade and was shot by one of the Germans. Only one round was fired by the Germans during the raid on the HQ. Keyes was taken outside but quickly died; shortly afterwards, Campbell, having forgotten his orders to shoot on sight, was shot in the leg by one of his men. He passed command to Sergeant Jack Terry and remained behind. Terry gathered the raiding team and retreated with 17 men to rejoin Laycock at the beach. An Italian source, not explicit in naming the British names, points that Cooke's men encountered a platoon of Italian police paratroopers. The Italians had been searching for the British raiders close to the village Mansura (about north of Cyrene). =19 November= According to the source, 2nd Lieutenant Alfredo Sandulli Mercuro and the 3rd Platoon, 2nd Company, 1¬∞ encountered what he thought was a band of Arabs hiding along a mountain ridge on 19 November. When called upon by Mercuro's Arab interpreter, the Italians were fired on and the paratroopers engaged what they now knew were British commandos, who withdrew to a cave. With no way out, the wounded commandos surrendered after Mercuro threatened to use flamethrowers on them. The paratroops took prisoner a group consisting of an officer, one NCO and three other ranks. Except for the officer, all the British were wounded and received medical treatment from the Italians. Mercuro searched the cave and found small arms and three demolition charges. The Italians suffered three wounded during the fight. It proved impossible for the Laycock party to re-embark on the submarines and they waited for the weather to improve. They were discovered and exchanged fire with local Italian gendarmes (and German troops by some accounts). Aware that they could not hope to stand off the large force that was surely being organised, Laycock ordered the men to scatter. Laycock and Terry made it to safety after 37 days in the desert and Bombardier John Brittlebank, one of the SBS team who had guided the commandos in the folbots, escaped and survived alone in the desert for forty days until picked up by Allied troops. The rest of the raiding force was captured, some of them wounded. Contrary to some reports, only Keyes was killed by the Germans; one man had drowned during the landing.

Charles Paxton, Cameron Highlanders Aftermath On 17 November 1941, the day of the raid, Rommel was in Italy, having left for Rome on 1 November, which became known to British military intelligence via Ultra on 17 November and that he was due back in Africa on 18 November. An emergency signal was sent to Middle East Command but was too late to stop the operation. On 15 November, a decrypt of an Italian C 38m machine cipher had revealed that the Italians knew from divers sources that a British landing was imminent near Apollonia. The German historian Hans Edelmaier suggests that Rommel was not the objective of the raid and his name not featuring in the plan supports this. There is no proof that Haselden reported Rommel's presence at the house in Beda and it has never been explained how Rommel was to be found or recognised by the commando unit. The only extant evidence that Rommel was the object of the raid came from a witness, Gunner Jim Gornall, who related that Keyes briefed the men on board the Torbay that their objective was to \\"get Rommel\\". When news of the raid reached him, Rommel was said to be indignant that the British should believe his headquarters was behind the front; Rommel preferred to be near the front line with his troops. =Casualties= The British suffered two men killed, 28 captured (three wounded) and three men escaped; German casualties were four killed and three wounded. Keyes' body and those of the four dead Germans were buried with military honours on Rommel's orders in a local Catholic cemetery. For his actions Keyes was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for the award was written by Robert Laycock, who contrary to British military custom, was not a witness to Keyes' actions on the night in which he was killed. Almost none of the statements in the citation are verifiable and some contradict witness accounts. Sergeant Jack Terry was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) and Bombardier John Brittlebank (SBS) later received the DCM for actions including the Rommel Raid. Gunner Jim Gornall was awarded the Military Medal (MM). (Another attempt, this time by an SAS group, was made to kidnap or assassinate Rommel in Operation Gaff in July 1944 but Rommel had suffered skull fractures in an RAF attack eleven days earlier.)

The show ran on the Columbia Broadcasting System between 1958 and 1960. Two of its 48 episodes served as pilots for the 1950s television series The Twilight Zone and The Untouchables. History Between 1951 and 1957, Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) and Lucille Ball (1911-1989) starred in and produced (via their Desilu production company) the immensely popular I Love Lucy show. In early 1958, Desi Arnaz convinced CBS to purchase Desilu Playhouse with the promise that a bi-monthly Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (later rebroadcast as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour) would be among the dramas, comedies and musicals planned for the show. Westinghouse Electric Company paid a then-record $12 million to sponsor the show, which resulted in the cancellation of the prestigious anthology series Studio One, also sponsored by Westinghouse. William Lundigan, Aldo Ray and Lucille Ball as the title character, \\"K. O. Kitty\\", the comedy shown as the show's fifth episode. Lucy plays a dance teacher who inherits a boxer's contract. (1958) The show debuted on Monday nights in the 10:00‚Äì11:00 pm [Eastern Standard Time] evening time slot on October 6, 1958, hosted by Desi Arnaz, with Betty Furness continuing as the Westinghouse spokesperson (as she had been on Studio One). The first show was \\"Lucy Goes to Mexico,\\" a Lucy-Desi Hour with guest star Maurice Chevalier. The dramatic \\"Bernadette\\" (a biography of the Roman Catholic Church's Saint Bernadette), starring Pier Angeli, premiered in week two. Later shows included comedies, dramas and musicals, and various one-off comedies and dramas starring Lucille Ball in non-\\"Lucy\\" character performances. In October 1959, the show moved to Friday nights from 9:00‚Äì10:00 pm [Eastern Standard Time]. The show lasted only one more year, due to an inability to attract big guest stars, the growing popularity then of westerns and police shows being shown on prime time. It ran opposite the competing ABC television network's highly rated 77 Sunset Strip that season, and the Arnaz- Ball divorce in 1960. Just prior to their marital breakup, Ball and Arnaz, along with Vivian Vance, William Frawley, and Little Ricky, filmed the last Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show, entitled \\"Lucy Meets The Moustache\\" and featuring guest stars Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams. This last hour-long installment of the I Love Lucy format and characters was broadcast on April 1, 1960. The final telecast of The Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, \\"Murder is a Private Affair\\", aired on June 10, 1960. Notable episodes Joan Fontaine and Maximilian Schell appeared in the drama Perilous in 1959. In the fall of 1958, \\"The Time Element\\". starring William Bendix, aired to positive reviews. Written by Rod Serling, the show's popularity gave Serling the leverage to convince CBS to give the go-ahead to Serling's concept for a science fiction/fantasy anthology series (which was what Serling had in mind when writing \\"The Time Element\\") that he called The Twilight Zone which debuted in the fall of 1959. In April 1959, Desilu Playhouse aired a two-part drama called \\"The Untouchables\\". Paul Monash adapted the 1957 memoirs of treasury agent Eliot Ness, played by Robert Stack. After CBS passed on the idea to produce a weekly version, The Untouchables became a hit series on ABC and ran for four seasons (1959‚Äì1963). Stack was selected only after Arnaz' personal choice, actor Van Johnson, agent demanded he be paid for 2 episodes at $10,000 each (the normal rate). Arnaz, according to Stack, blew his top at Johnson, fired him and called Stack and offered him the role.

At the show, she rode the horses, Sapelio, owned by George Chipchase and the winning Sceptre, owned by James Dunn. In 1912, while still in school, she attempted to enter the modern pentathlon in the 1912 Summer Olympic Games. For a short time, she was the only woman slated to compete at the games. She was ultimately not allowed to compete because she was a girl. The response from the Olympic committee to her request to enter was \\"hostile.\\" In 1914, she placed second in Ladies' saddle horse riding and first in Park and road hacks, riding on Sceptre. On March 20, 1915, she married George H. Chipchase in New York. A few months later, his former wife sued Preese in a Massachusetts court for using the Chipchase name and also claiming that there had been no divorce. In December 1934, she was married again in Boston to John Leslie Smith, a riding instructor.

He later became a Whig politician. Early life Lord George Augustus Frederick Paget was born on 16 March 1818. Paget was the youngest son of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey by his second wife Lady Charlotte, daughter of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan. Among his siblings were Lady Emily (wife of John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney), Lord Clarence Paget, Lady Mary Paget (wife of John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich), Lord Alfred Paget (MP for Lichfield), and Lady Adelaide Paget (wife of Frederick William Cadogan). His parents were both previously married, and divorced; his father to Lady Caroline Villiers (later the Duchess of Argyll), and his mother to Henry Wellesley (later 1st Baron Cowley). From his mother's previous marriage, his elder half-siblings included Hon. Charlotte Wellesley (wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury), Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley, and the Very Rev. Hon. Gerald Valerian Wellesley. From his father's previous marriage, his elder half-siblings included Lady Caroline Paget (wife of Charles Gordon- Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond), Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey, Lady Jane Paget (wife of Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham), Lady Georgina Paget (wife of Edward Crofton, 2nd Baron Crofton), Lady Augusta Paget (wife of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore), Lord William Paget, and Lady Agnes Paget (wife of George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford). Career Paget served in the Crimean War and fought at Alma and Balaclava in command of the 4th (The Queen's Own) Light Dragoons. He is frequently quoted for his references to the Russian engagement in Balaklava on the Crimean Peninsula: \\"Every fool at the outposts, who fancies he hears something, has only to make a row, and there we all are, Generals and all... Well I suppose 500 false alarms are better than one surprise\\". This quote was supposedly written just before the Russians surprised the camp. He is famous for having charged with the Light Brigade while smoking a cheroot (a type of cigar favoured by soldiers who served in India). =Member of Parliament= Apart from his military career, Paget sat as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Beaumaris between 1847 and 1857. He was made a KCB in 1870. Personal life On 27 February 1854, Paget married his first cousin Agnes Charlotte Paget, daughter of Sir Arthur Paget. They had two sons. After her death on 10 March 1858, just six days after the birth of her child, he married secondly Louisa Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Fieschi Heneage, in 1861. Paget died at his residence in Farm Street, Mayfair, London, in June 1880, aged 62. His widow remarried, as his third wife, to Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex, in 1881.

It was headed by the Indian National Congress (INC), which was the party with the largest number of seats in the 7th Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Chief Minister D. D. Lapang and the other ministers in the Government were all members of the MDA. D. D. Lapang also served as the Chairperson of the MDA. History After the 2003 elections to Legislative Assembly, INC Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) D. D. Lapang was elected the leader of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP). The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) first made a bid to form the Government, but they gave up when they were unable to provide the Governor M.M. Jacob with sufficient number of MLAs to prove majority in the Assembly. The INC then formed the MDA along with other parties and independents opposed to the NCP and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The MDA pledged to work for the state's economic development and also to provide stability of the government. With 40 members in the 60 member Assembly, Governor M.M. Jacob invited the MDA to form the Government. D. D. Lapang was sworn in as Chief Minister on 4 March 2003. Initial support At the time of its formation, the MDA included the following members: * Indian National Congress (INC) (22 MLAs) * United Democratic Party (UDP) (9 MLAs) * Meghalaya Democratic Party (MDP) (4 MLAs) * Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) (2 MLAs) * Independents (3 MLAs) In addition, the Hill State People's Democratic Party (HPDP) had also expressed willingness to join the MDA, but their MLAs were not provided to the governor when the MDA staked its claim to form the Government. D. D. Lapang (INC) served as the chairperson of the MDA while Dr. Donkupar Roy (UDP) served as the deputy chairperson. Martle Mukhim (MDP) served as the treasurer and R. G. Lyngdoh (INC) served as the spokesperson. Changes in constituents Though the HPDP legislators were not in the initial list of legislators submitted to the governor, one of their MLAs Dr. F. A. Khonglam was sworn in as a minister on 4 March 2003. Effectively, this meant the MDA had additional support of 2 MLAs from HPDP, taking their total strength in the 60-member Assembly to 42.http://oldcontent.northeastplus.in/2232.html Later in 2003, one additional independent joined the MDA, taking the total number of independents supporting the MDA to 4, and the total strength of the MDA to 43. On 16 December 2003, 6 legislators from the opposition NCP broke away from their party and formed a new party called the Meghalaya Nationalist Congress Party (MNCP). They then joined the MDA coalition increasing the strength of the coalition to 49. 4 of the 6 MNCP legislatures were given ministerial positions in the MDA Government. Controversies In mid-2004, after the 2004 Indian general election, the NCP joined the INC-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to form the Government of India. It was believed that this decision, might result in the MDA being disbanded with an INC-NCP combination to form the new Government in Meghalaya. However, on 31 May 2004, D. D. Lapang confirmed that the regional MDA coalition would not be affected by the new alliance at the central Government.http://oldcontent.northeastplus.in/3509.html In mid-2006, internal conflicts with the Meghalaya Congress Legislative Party (CLP) led to D. D. Lapang resigning as the CLP leader and as the Chief Minister under orders from the Congress high command. His former prot√©g√©, J. D. Rymbai was elected new leader of the CLP and Chief Minister on 15 June 2006. Despite the leadership change, the internal conflicts continued with both Lapang and Rymbai claiming majority support in the CLP. After less than a year in-charge, Rymbai was directed by the Congress high command to relinquish the position to Lapang after a secret confidence vote determined that Rymbai no longer had majority support. After refusing to comply with the high command directive for 5 days, Rymbai finally resigned on 10 March 2007. Lapang was reelected as the CLP leader and was sworn in as Chief Minister on 10 March 2008. Demise of Alliance In the lead up to the 2008 Meghalaya Legislative Assembly election all the regional parties forming the MDA decided to run against the INC. The UDP, MDP, KHNAM and HPDP fielded candidates against INC and made corruption and government failure as their main election issues to garner votes against the INC. This effectively meant the quiet demise of the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance. The MDA was effectively replaced by the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) after the 2008 elections as INC tried to form the Government with support from independents.

The book expresses its author's commitment to the use of glass in modern architecture, which had a significant impact on the concepts of German Expressionism.Mark Gelernter, Sources of Architectural Form: A Critical History of Western Design Theory, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 1995; p. 230.Robert Hughes, The Shock of the New, New York, Knopf, 1981; p. 177. Glass architecture Scheerbart had advocated a transformative new architecture of glass from his first novel, Das Paradies, through many subsequent works. In 1913 he attempted to organize a \\"Society for Glass Architecture,\\" an effort that brought him into contact with the Expressionist Bruno Taut. In the following year Scheerbart published not one but two books on the subject: his non-fictional Glass Architecture made the case for its subject in a more rational and pragmatic basis, while The Gray Cloth provided a far more imaginative and lavish presentation of the same matter.Rosemarie Haag Bletter, \\"Paul Scheerbart's Architectural Fantasies,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 34 No. 2 (May 1975), pp. 83-97. Plot summary The novel is set in the middle of the twentieth century, and opens in Chicago, where the protagonist Edgar Krug has designed an enormous colored-glass exhibition hall. An art exhibit is held there, accompanied by an organ concert. Krug, fiercely dedicated to his esthetic concepts, is unhappy that the bright colors of women's fashions clash with his architectural scheme. When he meets Clara Weber, the organist, he is struck by her gray dress with white lace trim; he finds it the perfect complement to the color effect of his hall. Krug impulsively asks Clara to marry him -- providing she agrees to wear the same style of clothing. Clara accepts Krug's terms, which are specified in their marriage contract. Once married, the couple leave for the Fiji Islands in Krug's private dirigible (it has a glass-walled cupola, and air conditioning). Though Clara accepts Krug's strange terms for their marriage, other women do not. Clara maintains a telegraphic correspondence with her American friend, Amanda Schmidt; and Amanda is highly critical of Clara's subservience in the arrangement. Later in the book, other women also protest its terms. Scheerbart provides portrayals of a number of strong female characters through the book, supporting its subtitle, \\"a Ladies' novel.\\" Krug goes to Fiji because he has an ongoing project there, a retirement home for airship pilots. He clashes with the project's sponsor over how much colored glass the building will accommodate. From Fiji, Krug and Clara travel to other sites throughout the world, to visit other projects. Their first stop is \\"Makartland\\" at the South Pole, an artists' colony for twenty women artists. There, a seamstress makes outfits for Clara that arrange her gray-and-white wardrobe scheme in imaginative ways. K√§te Bandel, one of the artists, joins the Krugs in their further travels; she debates artistic assumptions and values with Krug as they travel to Australia and then to Borneo. Bandel enrages Krug when she convinces Clara to wear a plaid scarf. Leaving Bandel behind, they fly to Japan; but Japanese women also react negatively to the gray and white. In the Himalayas and in Ceylon, Krug visits another projects; later the couple travel to an experimental station by the Aral Sea. They also visit Babylon and Egypt. Despite his enthusiasm for colored glass, Krug turns down an offer to build large glass obelisks atop the Pyramids of Giza. In the \\"Kurian Murian Islands\\" off the eastern coast of Arabia, Krug meets the tycoon Li-Tung, who commissions him to design houses suspended in mid-air (so that they don't scratch the majolica tiles with which the islands are paved). Li- Tung is passionate about color, and has Clara change into more varied silk outfits. Krug allows this. Their journey is not a parade of triumphs, however; in most places, Krug's ideas are resisted, criticized, and rejected to greater or lesser degrees. At Malta, though, a glass architecture museum in established. The Krugs end the novel at their glass house in Switzerland. At Babylon, Krug gives up on his determination about Clara's wardrobe, and agrees to strike the binding clause out of their marriage contract. By this time, though, Clara has become a convert to her husband's ideas about glass architecture, and maintains the gray fashion by her own choice. Impact Scheerbart certainly influenced Bruno Taut's Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition -- the first, last, and only design of German Expressionist glass architecture that was actually constructed. Taut inscribed the fourteen sides of the structure with fourteen quotations from Scheerbart's works. Scheerbart's writings also influenced Carl Krayl, Wenzel Hablik, and other members of the Glass Chain group.Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1908; p. 116. It is an open question how much influence the German Expressionists' work had on the glass skyscrapers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and other Modernist architects later in the century. The modernists rejected Scheerbart's strong emphasis on the use of colored glass. In one view, though, the modernist glass skyscrapers of the mid-twentieth century \\"came closer to realizing Scheerbart's vision than the utopian projects of Taut and other Expressionist architects.\\"Vincent Margolin, \\"Paul Scheerbart, The Gray Cloth,\\" Journal of Design History, Vol. 16 No. 1 (2003). Genre The Gray Cloth, like other Scheerbart works, is a challenge to classification. It can be termed a fantasy, though it also shares some characteristics of science fiction (a temporal setting in the future, and advanced technology). English edition Chronologically, The Gray Cloth is the last of Scheerbart's novels; but it is also the first to receive an English translation.Paul Scheerbart, The Gray Cloth: Paul Scheerbart's Novel on Glass Architecture, Introduced, Translated, and with Drawings by John A.

He served as a Union Army general. Early life and career Chetlain was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents were Swiss, and they came to the United States by the way of Canada. As an infant, he was taken to Galena, Illinois. He studied at local schools in Galena and later became a clerk. In 1852, he started a career in business, and by 1859, he had become wealthy. He sold his business in the U.S. and traveled in Europe. Upon returning, Chetlain participated in the 1860 presidential campaign.Warner, p. 81. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in 1861, Chetlain chose to follow the Union cause. He was said to have been the first man in Illinois to volunteer for the Civil War. On April 16, he was part of a meeting held in Galena to raise a volunteer company and, with Ulysses S. Grant, was prominent in its creation. When Grant declined the post, he suggested for Chetlain to be elected as the company's captain. In Springfield in late April the 12th Illinois Infantry was organized, and Chetlain's company was added to it.White, p. 390. On May 2 he entered the Union Army as captain of the 12th Illinois, and the next day, he was elected the regiment's lieutenant colonel.Eicher, p. 171. Shortly afterward, the 12th Illinois was ordered to Cairo, Illinois, and that September, it was part of the force used by Grant in the expedition against and capture of Paducah. Chetlain was then given command of Smithland, Kentucky, where he constructed fortifications to defend part of the Cumberland River. In January 1862, he rejoined his regiment, led it during the expedition up the Tennessee River, was at the capture of Fort Henry on February 6, and led his command during the Battle of Fort Donelson from February 12 to 16.

On April 27, he was promoted to colonel for gallantry during the action at Fort Donelson. In May, his command participated in the Siege of Corinth and then the battle there on October 3 and 4 during which Chetlain was again highly praised for his performance.Warner, p. 81; White, p. 391. Chetlain was then given command of Corinth, Mississippi, where he began to organize and train black soldiers for Union Army service. This assignment lasted until May 1863, and on December 18, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. On the advice of Grant, Chetlain was given the task of raising black troops in Tennessee and in Kentucky, with his headquarters located in Memphis. By October 1864, he had trained a force of about 17,000 men, who were \\"well armed, drilled, and disciplined.\\"White, p. 391. On June 18, 1865, Chetlain was brevetted to the rank of major general. Between 1865 and 1866, he commanded at Memphis and then at Talladega, Alabama On January 26, 1866, Chetlain was mustered out of the Union Army. His wartime performance has been described as follows: Later life After the American Civil War, Chetlain was assessor of Internal Revenue for the district of Utah from 1867 to 1869.

It is considered to be the modern-day town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, also located in Tunisia. The name Naraggara, a Libyan inscription, suggests a pre-Roman origin for the city, along with the name being bilingual in Latin and Neo-Punic. Battle of Zama Though not much is known about the ancient city itself, it receives recognition from Roman historian Livy as the site of the Second Punic War‚Äôs final battle, called Battle of Zama. The Romans, led by Scipio Africanus the Elder, defeated Hannibal‚Äôs Carthaginians and put an end to the 17-year war. The two armies found their way to Naraggara after Scipio devised a strategy to attack Carthage while Hannibal and his army were located in Italy. This was in an attempt to prevent Hannibal from defeating further Roman armies and instead be recalled to Carthage. After landing in Africa, the Roman army successfully defeated the Carthaginian army at the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC, which pressured the Carthaginians into offering peace. After the peace treaty was signed, the Carthaginian senate recalled Hannibal from Italy. However shortly thereafter, the agreement was breached by Carthage for attacking a Roman fleet in the Gulf of Tunis. This led to the war being resumed, with both Hannibal and Scipio deploying troops in Africa and eventually marching toward the battle site near Naraggara, where the Second Punic War would be won by the Romans. Some note a discrepancy of where the battle was actually fought. While Livy recounted Naraggara as the historical battle site, Polybius claims it occurred at Margaron, another ancient city nearby, though the exact location is unknown. This may be supported by the fact the features described by Livy and Polybius, in regards to the site of the Battle of Zama, are nowhere to be found near modern Naraggara. After the war‚Äôs conclusion and ensuing treaty, Carthage was dealt harsh punishments, one of which was requiring permission from Rome to wage war. This created an issue when settling border disputes with neighboring kingdom, and Roman ally, Numidia. After repaying its debt to Rome fifty years after the Second Punic War, Carthage repelled against Numidian invaders and ultimately suffered a military defeat. This attack angered Rome because they did not give such consent to Carthage, and thus declared war. This began the Third Punic War which lasted just four years and ended with Carthage being completely destroyed and all its people enslaved. With Carthage‚Äôs defeat, its lands and territories, including the area encompassing Naraggara, were claimed by Rome and formed as Africa Proconsularis. Naraggara arguably remained under Roman rule until the 5th century, when Vandals conquered the area and formed their own kingdom. Today Today, the modern town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef replaces Naraggara. It is part of the Kef Governorate in Tunisia, and has a population of 6,196 as of 2004. Bishopric Naraggara was an episcopal see and the names of some who were its diocesan bishops at certain dates are known:Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 467 Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, Brescia 1816, pp. 239‚Äì240 * Faustinus, a Donatist (411) * Maximinus (484) * Victorinus (525) * Bennatus (646) It is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 936 See also * Ralph Leo Hayes * The Battle of Zama * Ancient Carthage References Category:Carthage Category:Catholic titular sees in Africa ","title":"Naraggara"},{"id":"20815007","text":"The 2006 Hope-PBA All-Star Weekend was the annual all-star weekend of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)'s 2005‚Äì06 PBA season.

It is roughly 77 kilometers west of Bangkok. History The town was first officially registered as a sanitary district in 1916, after it was moved down the Mae Klong River from the old town, which is now part of Tha Pha municipality. The new town, when it was first built, was flooded with Chinese immigrants migrating from southern China where drought had occurred for four consecutive years in the 1920s. During the Second World War, the town experienced an economic boom due to its location being a hub between Bangkok to the east, Kanchanaburi to the north, and all the provinces in the south of Thailand. All goods transported by rail from Bangkok, Kanchanaburi, Burma and the southern provinces had to make a stop in Ban Pong. In 1935, the sanitary district was upgraded to town status (thesaban mueang). During the Second World War, the town was used by Japanese Forces as a base in the region while they were connecting the railway between Burma and Thailand, with train services running between Ban Pong and Mawlamyine in Burma during and for a few years after the war. In the 1960s, the town again experienced an economic boom when several sugar refineries opened up in the area. Many large banking and governmental institutions sited their regional branches in Ban Pong. Economy In the district there are more than 400 factories, producing everything from jewellery to car parts to noodles. Hence, the town centre remains vibrant and prosperous. In recent years the town centre has experienced a decline in its importance due to the opening of many hypermarkets on the town's outskirts.

It was the first real-time strategy game released on the Game Boy Advance platform, and was released in 2001. Gameplay Screenshot of a battle in Mech Platoon. Mech Platoon follows real-time strategy gaming standards, and is in the vein of other games such as StarCraft and Command & Conquer. The player assumes the role of an army commander for one of three in-game nations, and must battle on five planets each with multiple missions. In a battle, the player utilizes resources on a battlefield to build a base and attempt to overrun their opponent with \\"Mechs\\", the units featured in the game. There are three different types of resources found in the game: Energy Sand, Material Rock, and Laser Crystal. Resources are used to purchase units, and lower-grade resources such as sand can be used to buy more expensive resources such as rock and crystal. Due to Game Boy Advance hardware limitations, there is a 30-unit maximum per stage and no fog of war. There are twenty standard mechs that are unlocked throughout the game to use during battles, but each of these are customizable with different variants. Each mech also has its own attributes, ranging from differing hit points to varying levels of attacks. Development The game was first displayed to the public at E3 2001, where critics were impressed by the game's graphics but noted problems with unit path finding. A later build was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 2001. Reception Mech Platoon received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot lauded Mech Platoon for its graphics and standard real- time strategy conventions on a portable system, writing, \\"Mech Platoon compromises nothing compared with stalwart veterans like Starcraft or Command & Conquer.\\" GameSpy praised the game for its level selection and detailed graphics. GamePro noted, \\"[Mech Platoon] boasts lots of nifty features and a few annoying flaws that keep it from beating up on its bigger PC cousins.\\" Criticism generally focused on the game's sound and the problems with a portable real-time strategy game. GameSpot noted, \\"[the game's audio] is composed of mostly ear-wrenching midi music with a smattering of crisp digitized sound effects.\\" GameSpy compared Mech Platoon unfavorably against turn-based strategy games on the Game Boy Advance, such as Nintendo's Advance Wars.

The manual was published subsequent to the Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, though the latter is still published as a guide for identifying unknown bacteria.Bergey‚Äôs Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Book Review Int. J. of Syst. Bact.; July 1985, p. 408 First published in 1923 by David Hendricks Bergey, it is used to classify bacteria based on their structural and functional attributes by arranging them into specific familial orders. However, this process has become more empirical in recent years.History of the Manual The Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea is a derived publication indexing taxon names from version two of the manual. It used to be available for free from the Bergey's manual trust website until September 2018. Michigan State University provides an alternative version that indexes NamesforLife records. Organization The change in volume set to \\"Systematic Bacteriology\\" came in a new contract in 1980, whereupon the new style included \\"relationships between organisms\\" and had \\"expanded scope\\" overall. This new style was picked up for a four-volume set\\"The new format, which has an expanded scope and examines relationships between organisms (systematics), is called Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Work on the first volume in the four-volume sequence began in 1980 and was ...\\", \\"Microbiology\\" by Daniel V. Lim, Kendall Hunt, 2003 that first began publishing in 1984. The information in the volumes was separated as: Volume 1 included information on all types of Gram-negative bacteria that were considered to have \\"medical and industrial importance.\\" Volume 2 included information on all types of Gram-positive bacteria. Volume 3 deals with all of the remaining, slightly different Gram-negative bacteria, along with the Archaea. Volume 4 has information on filamentous actinomycetes and other, similar bacteria.\\"Bergey's Manuals\\", Understanding bacteria by Sheela Srivastava, Springer, 2003, Pg. 40 The current volumes differ drastically from previous volumes in that many higher taxa are not defined in terms of phenotype, but solely on 16S phylogeny, as is the case of the classes within Proteobacteria. The current grouping is: * Volume 1 (2001): The Archaea and the deeply branching and phototrophic Bacteria * Volume 2 (2005): The Proteobacteria‚Äîdivided into three books: ** 2A: Introductory essays ** 2B: The Gammaproteobacteria ** 2C: Other classes of Proteobacteria * Volume 3 (2009): The Firmicutes * Volume 4 (2011): The Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes (Mollicutes), Acidobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Fusobacteria, Dictyoglomi, Gemmatimonadetes, Lentisphaerae, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and Planctomycetes * Volume 5 (in two parts) (2012): The Actinobacteria Bergey's manual of systematics of archaea and bacteria (2015), an online book, replaces the five-volume set. Bergey's Manual Trust Bergey's Manual Trust was established in 1936 to sustain the publication of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology and supplementary reference works. The Trust also recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to bacterial taxonomy by presentation of the Bergey Award and Bergey Medal, jointly supported by funds from the Trust and from Springer, the publishers of the Manual. Bergey's Manual Trust and John Wiley & Sons, Inc. co-publish the online encyclopedia Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria (BMSAB).

It was released on June 16, 2009. The novel focuses on Auden West, who never sleeps at night due to her parents' continuous fighting when she was in high school. Before heading off to college, Auden decides to spend her summer before college with her father and his new wife and baby. Although Auden is at first reluctant, she comes to really like her stepmother and half sister. Auden also ends up spending her nights making up for her lost childhood with Eli, a loner and insomniac with an intriguing past. She learns that second chances are possible and questions if people can truly change. Plot summary Auden West is a smart girl who didn't get the chance to enjoy the activities young children often got to do (such as riding a bike) when she was a child. After being accepted into Defriese University and graduating high school, Auden is not sure on how to spend her summer. After receiving a package from her brother Hollis who is touring Europe, she decides to take up her father's offer to spend her summer before college in the beach town Colby. When she arrives, she hopes she can have some bonding time with her father. However, she is disappointed to find out that that will not be the case since her father spends all his time working on his novel. One night Auden heads down to the Tip, a stretch of beach where all the teens hang out. At the Tip she runs into a guy named Jake, with whom she almost ends up having a one-night stand with. Feeling guilty and wrong about what she was doing, Auden leaves for home. Early in the morning, she helps out her step mother by supervising her half-sister, Thisbe, while Heidi rests. Auden also helps Heidi run an errand pertaining to Heidi's boutique named Clementine's. There she meets one of Heidi's employees, Maggie. Maggie's friends Leah and Esther walk into the store and reveal to Maggie that her ex-boyfriend Jake (who she is still in love with) hooked up with a girl the previous night, though they don't know that it was Auden yet. Once they figure out who he hooked up with, Auden ends up briefly explaining to Maggie that she has no relationship with Jake whatsoever. The next day Auden's family decides to head down to the Last Chance for dinner. It is clear that Auden's father is irritated since he does not want to leave the house so he can finish his book. Heidi has to go to her boutique on the way to dinner due to a business error, which makes Auden's father even more irritated. While waiting for Heidi at the diner, Auden is prompted by her father to take care of Thisbe outside. Eli helps her out by calming down Thisbe. At that moment, Heidi appears and thanks Eli, who leaves. She informs Auden that Eli runs the bike shop next to her boutique. She also mentions that Eli has a little brother around Auden's age named Jake. Auden quickly realizes that Eli's little brother Jake is the same Jake she fooled around with. At dinner a dispute rises between Heidi and Auden's father which they leave unresolved. Realizing their fight is not over, Auden does not go home until two hours later. However, Auden arrives at the peak of the fight. Auden stays on the porch and overhears her father say that the only reason he invited Auden was so she can help out with Thisbe. She also overhears Heidi standing up for her and telling her father that he should spend more time with both his daughters. Auden leaves for another three hours and is unsure whether to feel grateful or not for Heidi defending her. Later that night after everyone was asleep, Auden spends the night fixing Heidi's finances. Grateful, Heidi offers Auden a job working on the store's books. After a remark from Auden's father, Auden accepts the job, much to her fathers disappointment. While Auden works she's treated kindly by the other girls. After a few days Auden's mother comes down to visit. She is highly critical of Heidi and the store for the stereotype of women it projects. Auden's mother notices that Auden has changed and once Auden defends Heidi. The employees at Heidi's boutique encourage Auden to go to a party with them and there she has an encounter with Eli. They keep bumping into each other, they eventually find out that both of them have nocturnal habits. They start hanging out with each other when night time comes. They do things that Auden hasn't really done before, such as bowling. The start getting closer and eventually they kiss for the first time at a bar. Auden asks Maggie if she can teach her how to ride a bike. Maggie agrees to help. Jason, Auden's ex prom date comes around. Auden breaks the friendship between her and Eli because she feels uncomfortable with how different she is becoming. Jason asks Auden to go with him to the Beach Bash, an event Heidi had planned for the end of the summer. Auden accepts. When the Beach Bash comes, Jason turns Auden down again. Auden asks Eli to go with her, but he rejects her and it takes a toll on Auden. However, when Eli and Auden meet again, they talk things out and decide to go to the Beach Bash together and have a great time. At the end of the book, Auden is at Ray's, a coffee shop she used to regularly visit when she had insomnia, with Eli. They end the novel being a couple again. Characters Major = *Auden Penelope West: Auden is the main character of Along for the Ride. She is a quiet and smart girl who lived with her mother after her parents' divorce, devoting herself to schoolwork in an attempt to please her perfectionist of a mother. Academia is like her \\"old friend\\" and she relies on it as her place to keep calm. Along the way, she realizes she lost most of her childhood because her parents treated her as an adult since she was young and she never bothered to participate in any of the important milestones of becoming a teenager. Auden decides to spend her last summer before college in the beach town of Colby where her father, stepmother and new baby sister live. Breaking free from the constraints of her parents' impossibly high expectations, Auden begins to live her own life, and discovers things about herself she never knew. Throughout the novel, she experiences many normal high school experiences she missed out on growing up. As she opens up to others and learns that yes, people can change, the world becomes a much more inviting place, with more things to offer than just textbooks to hide behind. *Eli Joseph Stock: Eli is a native of Colby who is an insomniac, like Auden. He and his best friend since grade school, Abe, rode bikes together in competitions until Abe died in a car accident where Eli was driving. Since the accident, Eli has kept to himself and seemingly stopped riding his bike until Auden finds him one lonely night, and they teach each other to grow and love again. *Dr. Victoria West: Auden's mother is a \\"Mensa level\\" scholar who has treated her daughter like an adult since she was a child. She doesn't particularly agree with Auden's decision to spend the summer with her father, but once she realizes that the trip has transformed Auden into a better person, she learns to embrace her life and appreciate her daughter. *Maggie: Maggie is another native of Colby who works at Clementine's, Auden's stepmother, Heidi's boutique. She dated Eli's brother, Jake, for most of high school, and they were in a rough patch when Auden came to town and hooked up with Jake on her first night in Colby. Maggie finds out that Auden and Jake had sex behind the sand dunes at The Tip, but she decides it is for the best and the two become friends. Maggie teaches Auden how to ride a bike, and the two are both very bright students and end up becoming roommates at Defriese University. *Adam: Adam is another native of Colby who works at the Bike shop, later called \\"Abe's Bikes\\". He is in love with Maggie, which everyone knows but Maggie. He helps teach Auden how to ride a bike. He was the only person on the staff of his high-schools yearbook, causing all other native to Colby not let him take a picture. Adam ends up dating Maggie at the end of the book. *Robert West: Robert is Auden's father. He is a professor at a college and divorced Auden's mother after she became more successful than him. He marries Heidi West and has Thisbe. He is described as selfish and never helps with Thisbe. He and Heidi fight and he moves out, but in the end, appears to want to turn a new leaf. Auden states that he moves back in at the end of the book. *Heidi West: Auden's upbeat 26-year-old stepmother who has been married to Robert West for about a year. Auden initially can't stand Heidi's enthusiasm and love for pink but later learns that she was wrong about her. She owns a boutique, Clementine's, which is next to the bike shop where Eli works. A self-proclaimed former \\"cold bitch\\", she dreamed of opening a store in New York City before she moved to Colby one summer to take care of her sick mother and met Auden's father. = Minor = *Jake Stock: Jake is a playboy, he dated Maggie, but had a relation with Auden behind the sand dunes and he is Eli's younger brother. *Belissa Norwood Eli's jealous ex-girlfriend, who got mad at Auden for trying to steal her boyfriend, because Auden was talking with Eli. Though in reality, she and Eli were just talking, and Belissa was oblivious to the actual conversation, accusing Auden falsely. *Hollis West: Auden's free-spirited, happy-go-lucky older brother who has been backpacking abroad in Europe for a couple years prior to the beginning of the story. He later returns home after having met and fallen in love with Laura, a scientist at \\"The U\\", whom Heidi noticed strongly resembled Auden's mother, and begins a steady job at a bank. He explains to Auden that all children are kids with their parents, unless the parents are too childish themselves - one of the reasons he'd left home. *Thisbe Caroline \\"Isby\\" West: The newborn daughter of Heidi and Robert, Auden and Hollis's father. She was extremely fussy until Heidi had a breakdown, prompting Auden to call Eli, who brought his mother Karen Stock, who raised four children and has four grandchildren, to help Heidi and give advice for caring for Isby. *Leah: Leah is another native Colby. She is best friends with Esther and Maggie. Clementine's is where she works. Leah is outgoing and ready to face the world girl. Throughout the story, the girls are always looking for things to after work. She always wants to go to the local dance club (Tallyho). *Esther: Esther is yet another native Colby, that works at Clementine's and is best friends with Leah and Maggie.

It was Liu's directorial debut and stars Du Huanan and Wang Lingbo as the titular Chen Mo and Meiting. The film was produced independently of the Chinese bureaucracy, primarily from funds solicited by Liu Hao himself, as well as some foreign investment from the Germany-based Zero Film. Chen Mo and Meiting tells the story of a flower vendor and a massage parlor girl, the children of persecuted intellectuals during the Cultural Revolution, as they enter into a shy and tentative romance.  Production  After writing the screenplay for Chen Mo and Meiting, Liu set out to find the money to finance his project. Eventually Liu was forced to search for benefactors from the phone book, eventually raising ¬•140,000 from a friend in Shanghai. Given the small budget, the film production was limited with Liu and the crew living in a small basement to save on housing costs. Post-production was funded primarily from Liu and his producers selling calendars on the street, eventually paying off debts over the course of two years. Though filmed in 16 mm, the film was blown up to 35 mm during post- production.  Release  Chen Mo and Meiting was screened as part of the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival's international Forum program. The film managed to win two awards at the competition: a NETPAC Prize and a Special Mention in the Premiere First Movie award. The film was also screened at the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival as part of its \\"Another View\\" program for more experimental works. As an independent and foreign-financed film, however, Chen Mo and Meiting was not given official approval and as a result was not released in China.

The institute, founded by Futa Helu (1934‚Äì2010), began as a continuing education programme for civil servants, then initiated a high school in 1964 (now independently operated by ACTS Community Schools) and a university in 1975. Aerial photo of the institute and surroundings  ªAtenisi Institute was initially a downtown night school providing continuing education for civil servants, evolving into a secondary daytime school in 1964. In 1966 Helu registered  ªAtenisi's high school with the government and at the end of that year leased a parcel in Tufuenga, a western district in the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa. The parcel is, in fact, below sea level and students often speak of the swampus instead of the campus. At the end of 1975 a small university joined the high school on the site, its first bachelor of arts degrees being awarded in 1980, followed a few years later by bachelor of science degrees. By the 1990s, some master of arts degrees ‚Äì and even a doctorate degree ‚Äì were awarded in collaboration with universities in Australia and New Zealand.  ªAtenisi High School In the 1960s there were not many high schools in Tonga, and the few that there were catered to either an economic or academic elite. To fill the gap,  ªAtenisi's high school assumed a populist stance, offering inexpensive and innovative education. Yet academic standards were high; for example, whereas other schools settled for the modest New Zealand syllabus,  ªAtenisi chose the more challenging syllabus of New South Wales, Australia. The 1970s and 1980s were the high school's heyday, at one point attracting some 800 students; however, enrollment began to fall in the 1990s in the face of competition from more than a dozen high schools established by the government or religious organizations. By 2005 school fees were no longer sufficient to cover costs. The school was forced to close in 2006, but reopened in 2007 before closing permanently at the end of 2009.  ªAtenisi Foundation for the Performing Arts Since the late 1980s, the  ªAtenisi Foundation for the Performing Arts (AFPA) has been a component of the institute, with a mission to preserve the music and dance of traditional Tongan culture, as well as train musicians in European classical music. The Foundation is widely regarded in Tonga as a national treasure. Its star soprano, 'Atolomake Helu, has performed at Sydney and Auckland Town Halls. For a time AFPA regularly toured overseas, performing European classical and operatic excerpts along with traditional Tongan faiva.  ªAtenisi University The university at 'Atenisi Institute was established seven years after the University of the South Pacific opened its Tongan campus. Nevertheless, the school was unique in being the only privately funded university in the South Pacific islands, and therefore autonomous from any church or government. This was both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage was that the university could freely train critical thought, rather than compel students to conform to bureaucratic obedience or religious dogma. The disadvantage was that the university rarely received funding from either of the aforementioned sources, which usually condemned it to an austere budget solely supported by modest tuition fees. Because the university regarded method of thought to be its pedagogical priority, philosophy was considered its most important course; facility with the English language and appreciation of English literature was a second key objective. In addition, the university offered core courses in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Because of its reputation for rigour, most  ªAtenisi University students found it relatively easy to obtain scholarships to graduate schools in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Retrenchment and Renovation In the early years of the university, its emphasis on philosophy was popular with Tonga's independent farmers: their sons might return to their modest plantations and display classical learning at weekend faikava (traditional kava circles). Yet with growing pressure for vocational success among Tonga's urban middle class, only the most talented students remain attracted to  ªAtenisi's classical credo. This has led to a decline in enrollment which, in the face of increasingly more viable tertiary training in Tonga and overseas, limits the small university that Futa Helu built. Presumably suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Futa Helu retired as institute director and dean of its university in 2007. Since 2008 there has been considerable turnover in administration. At first his daughter Sisi ªuno assumed the post of institute director in 2008, followed by his son Niulala in 2009, with Sisi ªuno returning in 2010. University management experienced turnover as well, with Dr. Michael Horowitz taking over as dean from 2008‚Äì2010, followed by Dr. Marilyn Dudley-Flores in 2011‚Äì2012.Pacific Media Watch: Tonga's  ªAtenisi becomes first accredited tertiary institution Dr.  ªOpeti Taliai, a Tongan anthropologist who holds a Ph.D. from Massey University as well as an  ªAtenisi undergraduate degree, served as dean from 2013 to 2014; he had previously taught linguistics at the institute. But after regionally promoting an acclaimed novella published in New Zealand, Dr. Horowitz returned as dean in 2015. There has been incremental renovation of the campus since Dr. Helu's death in February 2010. Three dilapidated buildings ‚Äì a science laboratory, print shop, and office cottage ‚Äì have been removed, with the laboratory being replaced by a compact module erected by Group Construction that has, however, not yet been equipped for laboratory instruction. By September 2014 the former university library had been abandoned and its collection moved to a building on the campus quadrangle. With the accession of the Democracy Party in 2015, 'Atenisi's relationship with the Tongan government improved markedly. In August the university was promptly awarded a two-year extension of its registration, whilst New Zealand Aid is currently considering extending tuition assistance to its undergraduates. In September 2015, Finance Minister Dr. 'Aisake Eke delivered the featured address at the university's 40th anniversary, saluting 'Atenisi's's signature methodology of critical thinking. Documentary film In August 2012 a film on Futa Helu's life and the history of  ªAtenisi was screened at the New Zealand International Film Festival, garnering favourable reviews in the New Zealand Herald and Overland. The documentary, Tongan Ark, was created, directed, and photographed by Paul Janman, a Welsh-Kiwi anthropologist and former  ªAtenisi instructor.Tongan Ark profiles Futa Helu and the 'Atenisi visionNZ Film, Tongan Ark, is selected to screen ‚ÄòIn Competition‚Äô at FIFO Pacific International Documentary Film Festival, 11 ‚Äì 17 February 2013At sea with 700 Tongans on an unruly, but inspirational Ark Tongan Ark went on to play at several U.S. and European film festivals and in 2013 was screened on New Zealand's Rialto Channel as part of a showcase of New Zealand cinema.

Founded in 2005, the festival often takes place the weekend after Labor Day and features food vendors, live music, and information booths. The event has always been free to attend. According to Paul Stanford, founder and director of the event:  History  The Portland Hempstalk Festival is an annual, two-day event. Hempstalk was first held in Portland, Oregon's Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland in 2005 and 2006, with about 10,000 visitors each of the first two years. In 2007, nearly 20,000 people attended the third annual Hempstalk festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park. While organizers insisted smoking would not be tolerated, the smell of marijuana lingered in the air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Originally slated for Tom McCall Waterfront Park, the event was temporarily canceled by Portland Parks & Recreation due to \\"unspecified 'problems' the city encountered with the event in the past two years there.\\" According to the Hempstalk official site, after being denied a permit at Waterfront Park based upon the city's ruling, the previous location was already booked and the City Parks & Recreation Department \\"refused to issue a permit to use a different park, citing unsubstantiated claims that minors were drinking beer in the park ... and widespread marijuana smoking was taking place (not in public view and only by medical marijuana patients).\\" Hempstalk officials deny these claims. Due to limited space, officials had doubts about hosting the event at Sellwood Riverfront Park in the future. In 2008, the festival was held in Eastbank Festival Plaza, organized by Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation (THCF). In addition to the usual events and activities featured, the two-day event offered educational panels to inform attendants about industrial hemp, the legal use of marijuana, and answer any other questions they may have. On September 12‚Äì13, 2009, the Portland Hempstalk Festival moved to Kelley Point Park, in the far Northwest corner of Portland, Oregon, at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Willamette River. 40,000 people attended over two days.http://www.hempstalk.org/downloads/hempstalk2009-white-8x11.pdf Music was performed by Native American political activist, poet and songwriter John Trudell and his band, Bad Dog, Folk Uke (Amy Nelson and Cathy Guthrie, daughters of Willie Nelson and Arlo Guthrie), the Herbivores, Rocker T, the Human Revolution, Binghi & the Seventh Seal, State of Jefferson, Marquee, Pass Margo and Tim Pate. Speakers included famed author and activist, Jack Herer, making his fifth Hempstalk appearance. Herer had a heart attack and collapsed moments after giving a speech on Saturday, September 12. He was in critical condition in a Portland area hospital for a month and moved to a Eugene, Oregon nursing home in early October 2009 for further recovery. Other Hempstalk speakers have included National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) founder Keith Stroup, NORML director Allen St. Pierre, THCF and CRRH director and author of the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Paul Stanford, Oregon NORML director Madeline Martinez, Chris Conrad, Mikki Norris, comedian and writer Ngaio Bealum, Green Party 2012 presidential candidate, Jill Stein, author Bill Drake, Dr. Tod Mikuriya, Dr. Phillip Leveque, Seattle Hempfest director Vivian McPeak, and medical marijuana pioneer, Dennis Peron.

They claimed to experience gifts of the Holy Spirit such as prophecy, speaking in tongues, and even casting out demons. They caused a stir at a local Adventist camp meeting, which was reported in the local newspaper. They later sought the counsel of Ellen G. White, whom Adventists believe had the gift of prophecy. White was initially cautious regarding their experiences, and later came out opposed to them. After leading some meetings at an Adventist church for a time, they pass from prominence in the church.  Biography  On November 12, 1908 Ralph Mackin and his wife from Ohio visited Ellen White at her \\"Elmshaven\\" home in California, having called on Willie White the previous day. Aged in their thirties, they sought her counsel and approval of some spectacular experiences, but she counseled not to continue. Ralph stated, \\"If we are in a delusion, we want to know it, just as much as if we were in the right.\\" His wife added, \\"Our brethren certainly think that we are in a delusion.\\" First of a three part series \\"The Ralph Mackin Story\\". Republished by the Ellen G. White Estate in one section of Charismatic Experiences by Arthur White. The meeting was recorded by White's leading secretary Clarence C. Crisler) Nearly three years earlier their Findlay, Ohio church sought \\"the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.\\" They studied the Bible and Ellen White's writings, seeking a \\"blessing of sanctification\\" which they received in the form of speaking in tongues as in . The Mackins had visited a family in Clyde who also received the \\"blessing\\", marked by weeping in many of them. A \\"little girl ten or eleven years old\\" told them \\"through the Spirit of prophecy\\", \\"You go to Toledo\\". They were also told imprisonment would ensue there. In Toledo a Polish Catholic heard Mrs. Mackin in his own tongue. When the Mackins returned to Clyde they were arrested for mesmerism. This occurred six or eight weeks before seeing the Whites. They caused a stir at the Adventist camp meeting in Mansfield, Ohio, which resulted in the arrests of the Mackins, plus their daughter, Ralph's mother, and \\"Sister Edwards\\". They believed the Spirit had told Mrs. Mackin to go to the campground and sing, \\"only as she prays in the Spirit and special power comes upon her.\\" However they were arrested for disturbance. In court, one witness testified, \\"I never heard such singing in my life. It just thrilled me through and through.\\" Supporters had stated, \\"It is when the singing is extemporaneous ‚Äì dictated by the Spirit ‚Äì that it is the most wonderful.\\" (They also claimed the gift of tongues, with Ralph speaking Chinese and his wife Yiddish as the result of a vision;Daily Shield 22 August. Mansfield, Ohio. As quoted by Arthur White) They read numerous passages from the Bible, and some experiences of Ellen White. They also spoke of casting out demons: :\\"The Lord instructs us to lay the people down, lest the demons throw them when they come out. We found in the beginning that when we begin to rebuke these demons they oftentimes close the eyes of these people, and will sometimes cause them to bark like a dog, and stick out their tongue; but as we continue to rebuke them, why, the eyes open and they become calm\\". Reprinted in one section of Charismatic Experiences by Arthur White (White later rebuked them: :\\"The work of declaring persons possessed of the devil, and then praying with them and pretending to cast out the evil spirits, is fanaticism which will bring into disrepute any church which sanctions such work.\\") Ellen White expressed her caution, sharing how past experiences had made her \\"fearful of anything savoring of a spirit of fanaticism.\\" It had tarnished the church's image, taking \\"years to outlive the influence that these exhibitions of fanaticism had upon the general public.\\" She said they should focus on sharing the Bible: \\"We must direct the minds of the people to the Word as the foundation of our faith...It is through the Word‚Äî-not feeling, not excitement‚Äî that we want to influence the people to obey the truth. On the platform of God's Word we can stand with safety.\\" The meeting concluded, and the following day the Mackins went to San Jose. Reprinted in one section of Charismatic Experiences by Arthur White Ralph was invited to preach at the church there, and meetings continued for several days until the pastor returned and stopped them, following which Ralph continued to hold meetings in supporters' homes.\\"How the Mackins Got Into the San Jose Church\\", communication from Irene Moon-Winn to the White Estate. Reprinted just below this section in Charismatic Experiences by Arthur White Two weeks later Ellen wrote to S. N. Haskell, \\"before the end\\" some \\" will treat as something of great importance these peculiar manifestations, which are not of God, but which are calculated to divert the minds of many away from the teachings of the Word.\\" Later, \\"God's work is ever characterized by calmness and dignity.\\"Letter 338, from Ellen White to S. N. Haskell, 26 November 1908. Republished in Selected Messages book 2, chapter 4, \\"Warnings Against Deceptive Claims of the Spirit's Guidance\\", p41‚Äì42 In December Ellen White received one or two visions about the case, and wrote two letters on the 11th, one to the Mackins and one to \\"Our Brethren in California\\". To the Mackins she wrote in part, \\"You suppose that all you do is for the glory of God, but you are deceiving yourselves and deceiving others... You attempt to make the truth of God sustain false sentiments and incorrect actions that are inconsistent and fanatical.\\" She also wrote, \\"I was bidden to speak decidedly against this fanatical work.\\" She was concerned that fanaticism would give the church a bad image: :\\"I was shown that it was not the Spirit of the Lord that was inspiring Brother and Sister Mackin, but the same spirit of fanaticism that is ever seeking entrance into the remnant church.\\" Republished in Selected Messages book 2, chapter 4, \\"Warnings Against Deceptive Claims of the Spirit's Guidance\\", p46‚Äì47  See also  * Charismatic Adventism * Prophecy in the Seventh-day Adventist Church * Tongues in the Seventh-day Adventist Church  References  External links  * \\"Chap. 54 - The Mackin Case of Selected Messages vol. 3 by Ellen White, pp. 362‚Äì80 Category:Charismatic Adventism Category:American Seventh-day Adventists ","title":"Ralph Mackin"},{"id":"20815402","text":"Alfena is a Portuguese city and parish in the municipality of Valongo, Portugal.

The hospital stood on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Hunter River port of Newcastle, New South Wales, from 1817 until 2007. The hospital grew in step with Newcastle from its founding as a penal settlement and coal port. The first hospital on the site was built by and for convicts. They were followed by generations of patients, staff and supporters who were involved with an expanding seaport hospital and its many campuses. The hospital in turn had a powerful influence on the East End of central Newcastle and portside communities and on people's wellbeing throughout the Hunter Valley. During the mid to late twentieth century, under visionary medical superintendent, Chris McCaffrey, the hospital became a major centre for innovation in Australian Health Care, introducing reforms in specialist medical care and records keeping. By 2007, the year the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô closed, this was one of the oldest, largest and best-known hospitals in Australia. Redevelopment of the hospital site began in 2008 and, with the exception of the North Wing (opened in 1915) and the nurses' homes, much of the site was replaced by apartments.

Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35km from Ahmednagar city. Shani Shingnapur Devsthan Trust ,Shani Shingnapur is registered under Mumbai Public Trust act. Details Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, officially no theft was reported in the village although there were reports of theft in 2010 and 2011. The temple is believed to be a \\"jagrut devasthan\\" (lit. \\"alive temple\\"), meaning that a deity still resides in the temple icon. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is \\"Swayambhu\\" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black, imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since the start of Kali yuga. The village has a post office and a high school known as Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the village is wells.  Historical importance Shrine of Shani Shingnapur The story of the swayambhu statue handed down from generations through word of mouth, goes something like this: When the Shepherd touched the stone with a pointed rod, the stone started bleeding. The shepherds were astounded. Soon the whole village gathered around to watch the miracle. On that night Lord Shanaishwara appeared in the dream of the most devoted and pious of the shepherds. He told the shepherd that he is \\"Shaneeshwara\\". He also told that the unique looking black stone is his swayambhu form. The shepherd prayed and asked the lord whether he should construct a temple for him. To this, Lord Shani Mahatma said there is no need for a roof as the whole sky is his roof and he preferred to be under open sky. He asked the shepherd to do daily pooja and 'Tailabhisheka' every Saturday without fail. He also promised the whole hamlet will have no fear of dacoits or burglars or thieves. So, Lord Shanaishwara can be seen even today, in the open yard without any roof above. To this day, there are no doors for any houses, shops, temples. It is to be seen to believe that even post office has no door, not to speak of locks. Due to the fear of Lord Shani, none of the structures, be it dwelling houses, huts, shops, etc. situated within one kilometer radius of this Lord Shani temple have neither doors nor locks. No thievery or burglary was reported until 2010 when first theft was reported and again another one was reported in 2011. This Shani Shingnapur is visited daily by thousands of devotees praying for Lord Shaneswara's favour. The place is busiest on Saturdays. Shani Thrayodashi is considered to be a favorite day for the lord. Similarly Saturday falling on 'Amavasya'(new moon day in Sanskrit and many other Indian languages) is considered to be a favourite day for the Lord Shanaishwara and on that days devotees seeking his blessings throng this temple in thousands. In the many years history of the village, there has not been a single incident of theft, riots, murder or rape. It is believed that nobody from the village has ever gone to a home of the aged. Nor has there been a single complaint lodged in a police station. Shani Shingapur Shrine of Shani The shrine for Shani consists of a five and a half feet high black rock installed on an open-air platform, which symbolizes the god Shani. A Trishula (trident) is placed along the side of the image and a Nandi (bull) image is on the south side. In front are the small images of Shiva and Hanuman. Generally, the temple has 30‚Äì45,000 visitors a day, which swells to around three lakh (i.e. three hundred thousand) on amavasya (the no moon day), believed to be the most auspicious day to appease Shani. The village holds a fair in honour of the deity on this day. A bigger festival is held on new moon days that fall on Saturdays. Devotees bathe Lord Shani's image with water and oil and offer flowers, and udid to him. A palanquin procession of Shani is held on the day of the fair. Other festivals include the birthday of Shani, Shani Jayanti. The shrine gained popularity with the decade-old film Surya Putra Shanidev made by the film producer Gulshan Kumar. Entry to women Entrance Gateway of Shani Shingnapur According to a 400-year tradition, women are restricted from entering the inner sanctum. On 26 January 2016, a group of over 500 women, led by activist Trupti Desai, marched to the temple under the group \\"Bhumata Ranragani Brigade\\", demanding entry into the Inner sanctum. They were stopped by the police.Women marching to Shani temple stopped In a landmark judgement on 30 March 2016, the Bombay High Court asked Maharashtra government to ensure that women are not denied entry to any temple. On 8 April 2016, the Shani Shingnapur trust finally allowed the women devotees to enter the sanctum. UCO Bank In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security. The bank has doors, but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents.  Bull carting  Sugar cane juice extraction by bull carting, on way to Shani Shingnapur The way to Shingnapur village is covered with sugarcane fields and local people use bull to extract juice from the sugarcane, instead of machines and this type of juice extraction centres are known as Rasavanti.

Completed in 1910 by owner Thomas Higgins, an Irish American, the 10-story building was originally used for office space. The Engineers and Architects were Albert C. Martin, Sr. and A.L. Haley. It has been designated as a historical monument by the City as Historic-Cultural Monument #873. Although designed as an eight story high building, it was decided during the construction stage to add two additional floors in order to hold the reputation as being the highest building in the city centre. Background and development Thomas Higgins was born on 12th. July in 1844 in Boyle, County Roscommon in Ireland, son of Patrick Higgins, a farmer and Hanora Flanagan. He received some education in Ireland. He traveled out west seeking his fortune in the late 1800s. His first stop was in Troy where he worked in some iron mines. Another member of his family, Mary Keefe (n√©e Higgins), lived there. He worked as a lumberjack in Mosinee, Wisconsin for the years 1867-1870. He worked on dock building in Chicago which was hard heavy work that was poorly paid. On hearing that all the adventurers were heading for the Klondyke looking for gold he decided that so many guys were heading that way that there would be no gold for him. He headed south down river to St. Louis. In Louisiana he met some levee contractors from Ireland, and with them became a foreman. During the summer they worked for the Iron Mountain Railway. He then decided to head west, towards the Rocky Mountains and stayed alive by avoiding Indian attacks by not sleeping beside his open fire at night. He prospected for gold and diamonds in Oregon and Washington without much success. He heard that there were fortunes to be won in Peru and Arizona and tossed a coin to decide which direction to go. There were three towns in Arizona at that time, Tucson, Prescott and Phoenix. He reached Bisbee near the Mexican border in 1877 where he found a rich vein of copper which he worked until 1900. He sold up the mining business and moved to 1199 Magnolia Avenue in L.A. from where he ran a property business. Tom Higgins visited ireland in 1907. He was a philanthropist and supported Boyle Heights Orphanage, St. Thomas's Church in Pico Heights, and St. Vincent's College. He died after a long illness in 1920. The building was designed with natural air conditioning, using a ventilation shaft that allowed sunshine and fresh air to filter into offices. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2006: \\"The building's grand size, marble-lined hallways, zinc-lined doors and window frames, black-and-white mosaic tile lobby and 'wholesome and healthful' water -- purified through filters in the sub-basement -- attracted prominent businessmen. [Albert C.] Martin [Sr.], who would emerge as one of the most successful architects and structural engineers in Southern California, based his company there for 35 years.\\" Previous tenants The Higgins Building basement contained the city's first privately owned power plant. General Petroleum occupied six floors of the building for 15 years beginning in 1934. The building also housed the Los Angeles County Engineer Department for 25 years from 1952 until 1977. In addition to its architect Albert C. Martin, Sr., previous tenants included Clarence Darrow as well as the chancery office of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Renovation After spending many years derelict and underwater, the building was finally rescued by entrepreneurs Andrew Meieran and Marc Smith. Developer Barry Shy converted the upstairs offices into rental lofts in 2003 (later converted to condominiums in 2005); and Meieran and Smith opened The Edison in 2007, a post-industrial steampunk-styled nightclub in the building's basement. The Higgins Building has also been a filming location for films and television series.

Alberto Savino (born 1 September 1973) is an Italian footballer who currently plays for Nola as a defender. Career Born in Pompei, the Province of Naples, Savino started his professional career at Serie C2 side Savoia which is based in Torre Annunziata, located in the Province of Naples. In the summer of 1995, he was signed by Serie B side Brescia. He made his league debut on 10 September 1995, substituting Giandomenico Costi, in the 31st minute. He played for Brescia for 4 seasons, winning a Serie B championship and Serie A promotion in 1997, and followed the team as they were relegated back to Serie B in 1998. After Brescia failed to promoted back to Serie A, Savino was sold to Lecce in co- ownership deal in 1999, at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season, during which Lecce won promotion to Serie A as Serie B 3rd place. In summer 2002, he followed Lecce as they were relegated back to Serie B. He played the opening match of the season as Lorenzo Stovini's backup, coming on in the 60th minute. He made 4 more starts in 7 more league appearances in October and in November, before leaving on loan to league rivals Napoli in January 2003. Savino returned to Lecce, who had been promoted back to Serie A, but remained an unused sub throughout the entire season, before joining Serie B side Ternana in January 2004. In summer 2004, he joined Serie C1 side Napoli Soccer (a new company/team founded to replace the recently bankrupted S.S.C.

He played college football at the University of Louisville and was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft (28th overall) by the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Wood played nine seasons in the NFL, including a Pro Bowl appearance, before retiring following the 2017 season due to a neck injury. High school career Wood attended Elder High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he played both the tackle and guard positions. His team went 28-2 over the last two seasons, including two consecutive state titles. After playing tight end as a junior, Wood started all 15 games at offensive tackle in his senior year and earned first team All-League honors. Considered a two- star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Wood was not ranked among the nation's top offensive line prospects. He chose Louisville over Bowling Green, Ohio, Cincinnati, Indiana and Columbia. College career After redshirting his initial year at Louisville, Wood started all 12 games at center for the Cardinals in 2005. He earned Freshman All-American honors by Rivals.com, Sporting News and College Football News. Wood was an excellent student, earned Academic All-Big East accolades as well. Wood remained Louisville's starting center in his sophomore and junior seasons, starting all 13 and 12 games, respectively. Led by quarterback Brian Brohm, the 2007 Cardinals offense ranked sixth nationally with an average of 488.0 yards per game. Wood earned All-Big East honors in both years, and again in his senior season. He finished his career with 49 consecutive starts at center, the second-longest streak in school history behind Travis Leffew (51, 2002‚Äì05). Professional careerNFL draft= Alongside Alex Mack, Wood was considered one of the best centers available in the 2009 NFL Draft. He has been compared to Brad Meester by The Sporting News, but his instincts and \\"nastiness\\" on the field had scouts comparing him to the NFL's old time centers like Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tim Grunhard of the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood was selected with the 28th pick of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, using the pick acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles via a trade for Jason Peters. With Mack being selected with the 21st pick by the Cleveland Browns, at marked the first time two centers were drafted in round one since the 1983 NFL Draft, with Dave Rimington and Don Mosebar. =Buffalo Bills= In his rookie season, Wood was counted on to start at right guard. He joined a completely retooled Bills offensive line that was expected to feature two rookie starters‚Äîhim, and second round pick Andy Levitre at left guard‚Äîand no players returning at the same position. On July 28, 2009, Wood signed a five-year contract with the Bills, reportedly worth more than $12 million. Wood in 2016 Wood immediately became the Bills starting right offensive guard next to center Geoff Hangartner, with Levitre at left guard. On November 22, 2009, in his 10th game, Wood fractured his tibia and fibula in the fourth quarter of an 18‚Äì15 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, after Jaguars defensive tackle Montavious Stanley ran into Wood's leg. Wood underwent season-ending surgery in a Jacksonville hospital and did not return to Buffalo with the team. He was placed on the injured reserve list on November 24, 2009. On March 30, 2010, Wood told the Buffalo Bills that his leg was healing well and that he gave it an 80% chance to be ready for training camp.. He eventually started 14 games in the 2010 NFL season, missing only Steelers and Vikings games because of an ankle injury. The Bills were playing the same trio up the middle: Wood at right guard, Hangartner at center, and Levitre at left guard. In 2011, Wood was switched to center, between Levitre and new starting right guard Kraig Urbik. These three have been instrumental in the resurgence in the Bills offense, led by Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback and Fred Jackson at running back. However, he was hurt in game 9 and did not play the rest of the year, replaced first by Urbik and then by Colin Brown. In 2015, the NFL announced Wood as one of the 32 players honored as the Bills' Man of the Year and eligible to win the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. It was reported that Wood suffered a broken leg playing in a game against the Seattle Seahawks on November 7, 2016. The Bills reported that this injury would keep Wood out for the remainder of the season. He was placed on injured reserve on November 14, 2016. On August 26, 2017, Wood signed a two-year, $16 million contract extension with the Bills. On January 26, 2018, after the Bills made their first playoff appearance since 1999, Wood announced that he had failed his end-of-season physical and would no longer be cleared to play professional football. Adam Schefter of ESPN said the cause of the failed physical, a neck injury, was partially due to wear and tear, but also part of a \\"complicated medical situation\\" (Wood later specified that the disc between his second and third vertebrae had come dangerously close to his spinal cord, which he suspected happened during the week 6 game of the 2017 season). Wood had played through the entire 2017 season, handling every offensive snap that year without missing any. He had intended to wait until after the 2018 Pro Bowl to announce the injury; he had been designated as an alternate to the game and did not consider his condition to be a hindrance to playing in the game. News of the injury had leaked to the press two days before the game, and the two Pro Bowlers named to the position for the AFC both played in the game. He reached an injury settlement with the Bills on May 31, 2018, and was officially released. Post-playing career In September 2018, Wood signed on as a columnist for The Athletic.https://theathletic.com/author/eric-wood/ Retrieved September 27, 2018.

The facility seated 6,500 and expanded to 9,000, and provided parking for over 3,900 vehicles. A 200-bed dormitory facility located on the grounds of the Homestead Sports Complex complemented the training facilities. The dormitories consisted of 30 single rooms and 84 double rooms that were complete with restrooms, showers, dressing areas, a full service kitchen and recreational areas. History In 1991 the City of Homestead built the Sports Complex at a price tag of $22 million in order to provide a spring training facility for the Cleveland Indians. The stadium was widely recognized as being state-of-the-art for the time period, as it included multiple practice facilities as well as dormitories for players. The Indians had previously played in the Cactus League in Arizona but had signed a deal to make Homestead their long-term spring training home. Cleveland was due to begin full-time play at the stadium in the 1993 season. In 1992 they had already begun moving equipment and personnel to Florida. However, on August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew made landfall in Homestead as a Category 5 cyclone with winds reaching 165 mph. The stadium, directly in the path of the hurricane, was decimated. The Indians quickly began meetings with lawyers and eventually they exercised an \\"out clause\\" in the contract. The city decided to immediately re-construct the stadium hoping that they could have it built for the 1994 spring training season in order for the Indians, or perhaps another team to use. However, without a spring facility for the 1993 season Cleveland was forced to look quickly for another home. The Boston Red Sox were leaving Winter Haven, Florida's Chain of Lakes Park after 26 years, allowing the Indians to use Chain of Lakes as their spring facility. However, knowing the situation that the Indians were in, Winter Haven allowed the team to use the stadium on the condition that they sign a 10-year contract. Cleveland had no other choice, so they signed the deal and left Homestead without a team. Homestead decided to continue re-building the stadium, assuming that at some point in the future they could lure another team to use it as their spring facility. The stadium was re-constructed in a very short period of time, as the original blueprints were kept. However, after about five years without a tenant it started to appear that the facility may never be used as a home for baseball. In the meantime, new spring training facilities were constructed such as Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida and Champion Stadium at Walt Disney World. The new stadiums began to surpass Homestead Sports Complex in terms of facility size and technology. The city had to look at other options in order to pay the nearly $450,000 per year in order to maintain it. It was offered as a home for the US Soccer Federation to conduct its training, but they declined. The Florida Legends of the Ladies League Baseball (LLB) played their home games at Homestead in 1998. In 1999 the facility was used as part of the filming of the Oliver Stone movie Any Given Sunday. In 2002 an HBO series called Baseball Wives was to be primarily filmed at the stadium, but the show was canceled before ever getting off the ground. In 2004, it served as the home of the Florida Thunder, the city's Pro Cricket team. The facility hosted local youth and adult sports on the training grounds but the internal workings of the stadium such as bathrooms, electrical and plumbing had gone into disrepair. The park was used for the City of Homestead's Fourth of July celebration until the Homestead-Miami Speedway took over the duties in 2010, attracting an exponentially larger crowd than ever before. The facility was damaged again by 2017's Hurricane Irma. After Hurricane Irma, the City Commission requested a feasibility study on the complex. Five of the six options in the study involve tearing down the ball park. The city solicited demolition bids. The ballpark was demolished on May 20, 2019. Prior to the structure being demolished, it served as a temporary police station while the city awaited the completion of its new police headquarters building. The city's police department had vacated its old headquarters in the Homestead Historic Downtown District prior to completion of the new headquarters building.

He founded the influential publisher Zhonghua Book Company, and was an early advocate for simplified Chinese characters. Early life Lufei was born in a scholar-official family in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, though his parents had come from Tongxiang, Zhejiang. His mother was a niece of Li Hongzhang, a famous Chinese politician during the late Qing dynasty. In his early years, Lufei was taught in classical Chinese by his mother.ÈôÜË¥πÈÄµ‰∏é‰∏≠Âçé‰π¶Â±Ä,‰øûÁ≠±Â∞ß,ÂàòÂΩ¶Êç∑,‰∏≠Âçé‰π¶Â±Ä,2002 (Lufei Kui and Zhonghua Book Company) Beginning in 1898, he attended to Nanchang English School () and started to learn English and Japanese. He was influenced by new thought and was thus pro- revolutionary. Career In the spring of 1903, Lufei went to Wuchang, where he launched the \\"Xinxuejie Bookstore\\" (). As the manager, he sold many pro- revolution books and booklets. He joined the underground revolution movement and became a surveillant. In 1905 he became the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Chubao () and after the closure of the newspaper under the pressure of Governor Zhang Zhidong he fled to Shanghai. There, he was employed as the manager and editor of a publishing company. In late 1906, Lufei joined Wenming Books, a textbook publishing company as an editor, and also became the headmaster of Wenming Primary School. As his contributions and responsibilities increased at Wenming Books, he started to become a major figure in education and publishing in Shanghai. In 1908, Lufei joined The Commercial Press and soon was in charge of publication and communications. In 1909, the Commercial Press started the first professional magazine in education in China, the Jiaoyu Zazhi (), and Lufei became its Editor-in-Chief. Lufei believed that education was the key in making a better nation. He published many essays and thesis on the magazine to introduce his ideas in educational reforms. In 1909, Lufei published an article titled \\"General Education Should Use Vernacular Characters\\" () on Jiaoyu Zazhi. This is the first time in history to advocate the promotion of simplified Chinese characters. In 1922, Lufei published another article \\"Deliverance on Coordinating Chinese Characters\\" (), in which he suggested that educators should respect the simplified characters invented by the folk and should adopt these characters in their teaching. He also proposed to simplify complex characters systematically. Ê±âÂ≠óÁÆÄÂåñÂ∏∏ËØÜ, ÊñπËàüÂ≠ê Lufei is also known as the founder of Zhonghua Book Company, one of the most influential contemporary publishing company, in textbooks, dictionaries, translations of important books in the world, as well as in classical Chinese and Chinese historical publications. Lufei founded Zhonghua Book Company in 1912 on the same day as the founding of Republic of China (1912-1949) and immediately published a new set of textbooks for schools in the post Qing dynasty republic. In the 1930s, Zhonghua was one of the most successful publishing companies in East Asia. By the Second Sino- Japanese War, the annual income of Zhonghua was over 10,000,000 yuan and had over 40 branches throughout China. In Shanghai and Hong Kong, it had over 3,000 employees. Under the management of Lufei, Zhonghua published a series of important books for Chinese cultural and historical studies, such as Zhonghua Da Zidian, Cihai, Sibu Beiyao () and the Gujin Tushu Jicheng.

That is, the graph should have no edges that start within the closure and end outside the closure. The closure problem is the task of finding the maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a vertex-weighted directed graph... It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem. It may be used to model various application problems of choosing an optimal subset of tasks to perform, with dependencies between pairs of tasks, one example being in open pit mining. AlgorithmsCondensation= The maximum-weight closure of a given graph G is the same as the complement of the minimum-weight closure on the transpose graph of G, so the two problems are equivalent in computational complexity. If two vertices of the graph belong to the same strongly connected component, they must behave the same as each other with respect to all closures: it is not possible for a closure to contain one vertex without containing the other. For this reason, the input graph to a closure problem may be replaced by its condensation, in which every strongly connected component is replaced by a single vertex. The condensation is always a directed acyclic graph. =Reduction to maximum flow= Reduction from closure to maximum flow As showed,. a maximum-weight closure may be obtained from G by solving a maximum flow problem on a graph H constructed from G by adding to it two additional vertices s and t. For each vertex v with positive weight in G, the augmented graph H contains an edge from s to v with capacity equal to the weight of v, and for each vertex v with negative weight in G, the augmented graph H contains an edge from v to t whose capacity is the negation of the weight of v. All of the edges in G are given infinite capacity in H. A minimum cut separating s from t in this graph cannot have any edges of G passing in the forward direction across the cut: a cut with such an edge would have infinite capacity and would not be minimum. Therefore, the set of vertices on the same side of the cut as s automatically forms a closure C. The capacity of the cut equals the weight of all positive-weight vertices minus the weight of the vertices in C, which is minimized when the weight of C is maximized. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, a minimum cut, and the optimal closure derived from it, can be found by solving a maximum flow problem. =Alternative algorithms= Alternative algorithms for the maximum closure problem that do not compute flows have also been studied... As cited by .. Their running time is similar to that of the fastest known flow algorithms. ApplicationsOpen pit mining= An open pit mine may be modeled as a set of blocks of material which may be removed by mining it once all the blocks directly above it have been removed. A block has a total value, equal to the value of the minerals that can be extracted from it minus the cost of removal and extraction; in some cases, a block has no extraction value but must still be removed to reach other blocks, giving it a negative value. One may define an acyclic network that has as its vertices the blocks of a mine, with an edge from each block to the blocks above it that must be removed earlier than it. The weight of each vertex in this network is the total value of its block, and the most profitable plan for mining can be determined by finding a maximum weight closure, and then forming a topological ordering of the blocks in this closure.. As cited by . =Military targeting= In military operations, high- value targets such as command centers are frequently protected by layers of defense systems, which may in turn be protected by other systems. In order to reach a target, all of its defenses must be taken down, making it into a secondary target. Each target needs a certain amount of resources to be allocated to it in order to perform a successful attack. The optimal set of targets to attack, to obtain the most value for the resources expended, can be modeled as a closure problem.. As cited by . =Transportation network design= The problem of planning a freight delivery system may be modeled by a network in which the vertices represent cities and the (undirected) edges represent potential freight delivery routes between pairs of cities. Each route can achieve a certain profit, but can only be used if freight depots are constructed at both its ends, with a certain cost. The problem of designing a network that maximizes the difference between the profits and the costs can be solved as a closure problem, by subdividing each undirected edge into two directed edges, both directed outwards from the subdivision point. The weight of each subdivision point is a positive number, the profit of the corresponding route, and the weight of each original graph vertex is a negative number, the cost of building a depot in that city.. Together with open pit mining, this was one of the original motivating applications for studying the closure problem; it was originally studied in 1970, in two independent papers published in the same issue of the same journal by J. M. W. Rhys and Michel Balinski... =Job scheduling= and describe an application of the closure problem to a version of job shop scheduling in which one is given a collection of tasks to be scheduled to be performed, one at a time. Each task has two numbers associated with it: a weight or priority, and a processing time, the amount of time that it takes to perform that task. In addition the tasks have precedence constraints: certain tasks must be performed before others. These precedence constraints can be described by a directed acyclic graph G in which an edge from one task to another indicates that the first task must be performed earlier than the second one. The goal is to choose an ordering that is consistent with these constraints (a topological ordering of G) that minimizes the total weighted completion time of the tasks... Although (as Lawler shows) this scheduling problem is NP-complete in general, Sidney describes a decomposition method that can help solve the problem by reducing it to several smaller problems of the same type. In particular, if S is a subset of the tasks that (among all subsets) has the largest possible ratio of its total weight to its total processing time, and in addition S is minimal among all sets with the same ratio, then there exists an optimal schedule in which all tasks in S are performed before all other tasks. As long as S is not the whole set of tasks, this partition of the tasks splits the scheduling problem into two smaller problems, one of scheduling S and one of scheduling the remaining tasks. Although S is a closure (for a graph with reversed edges from G) the problem of finding S is not exactly a maximum weight closure problem, because the value of S is a ratio rather than a sum of weights. Nevertheless, Lawler shows that S may be found in polynomial time by a binary search algorithm in which each step of the search uses an instance of the closure problem as a subroutine.

Itano, Seymour J. Singer and Ibert C. Wells that established sickle-cell anemia as a genetic disease in which affected individuals have a different form of the metalloprotein hemoglobin in their blood. The paper, published in the November 25, 1949 issue of Science, reports a difference in electrophoretic mobility between hemoglobin from healthy individuals and those with sickle-cell anemia, with those with sickle cell trait having a mixture of the two types. The paper suggests that the difference in electrophoretic mobility is probably due to a different number of ionizable amino acid residues in the protein portion of hemoglobin (which was confirmed in 1956 by Vernon Ingram), and that this change in molecular structure is responsible for the sickling process. It also reports the genetic basis for the disease, consistent with the simultaneous genealogical study by James V. Neel: those with sickle-cell anemia are homozygous for the disease gene, while heterozygous individuals exhibit the usually asymptomatic condition of sickle cell trait. The paper introduced the concept of a \\"molecular disease\\", and is considered a major impetus to the development of molecular medicine. The paper helped establish that genes control not just the presence or absence of enzymes (as genetics had shown in the early 1940s) but also the specific structure of protein molecules. It was also an important triumph in the efforts of Pauling and others to apply the instruments and methods of the physical sciences to biology, and Pauling used it promote such research and attract funding.Kay, Lily E. The Molecular Vision of Life: Catltech, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. pp. 256-260. Caltech work Linus Pauling was a prominent physical chemist at the California Institute of Technology (a main focal point of Warren Weaver's efforts to promote what he called \\"molecular biology\\" through Rockefeller Foundation grants). In the mid-1930s, Pauling turned his attention to the physical and chemical nature of hemoglobin. In 1946, he set graduate student Harvey Itano (who had been previously trained as a physician) the task of finding differences in hemoglobin that might explain sickle cell disease. After failing to find any differences in size, weight, or acid-base titration (despite the advanced instruments available at Caltech), Itano found that oxygen could inhibit the sickling process while various reducing agents could speed it up; this was the basis of Pauling and Itano's first publication on the disease. Itano also found that the globin portion of sickle cell hemoglobin had a barely detectable difference in electrical charge.Hager Thomas. Force of Nature: The Life of Linus Pauling. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. pp. 333-334. To measure this electrical difference precisely, Pauling assigned graduate student John Singer to work with Itano and another medical researcher, Ibert C. Wells, before Pauling left in early 1948 for a guest lectureship in England. Using a \\"Tiselius Apparatus\\" to perform free-boundary electrophoresis, Pauling's three researchers were able to estimate that molecules of sickle-cell hemoglobin had about three more positive charges than normal hemoglobin. They also estimated that blood from those with sickle cell trait was a mixture of 60 percent normal hemoglobin and 40 percent sickle-cell hemoglobin. Near the end of the project, they learned of parallel results by geneticist James V. Neel, who demonstrated the inheritance pattern of the disease by traditional genetic methods; both Neel's work and that of Pauling's group were published in the same issue of Science. Follow-up work Following the 1949 paper, Itano left the Pauling laboratory to work with Neel; in the following years Itano and Neel used electrophoresis to identify a number of other human hemoglobin variants, including some associated with other diseases. At Caltech, a comparison of the amino acid content of normal and sickle cell hemoglobins showed that there were several differences in chemical makeup, but did not explain the difference in electric charge that made electrophoretic separation possible. The cause of this difference was pinpointed in 1956 and 1957, when Vernon Ingram used protein fingerprinting (a combination of electrophoresis and chromatography) to show that the key difference between normal hemoglobins and sickle cell hemoglobins was a single difference in one chain of the protein: a glutamic acid residue on the normal hemoglobin in place of a valine residue on the sickle cell hemoglobin. The molecular disease concept put forward in the 1949 paper also became the basis for Linus Pauling's view of evolution. In the 1960s, by which time it had been shown that sickle cell trait confers resistance to malaria and so the gene had both positive and negative effects and demonstrated heterozygote advantage, Pauling suggested that molecular diseases were actually the basis of evolutionary change.Evolution and Molecular Disease, accessed January 5, 2009. He also advocated eugenic policies, such as marking all who carry the sickle cell trait and other molecular disease genes, to reduce the number of children born with genetic diseases.Eugenics for Alleviating Human Suffering, accessed January 5, 2009.

When rumors of dysfunction in the locker room were spreading in 2014 during Harbaugh's last year with the 49ers, Boone was one of his biggest supporters. However, that all changed once his coach had moved to Michigan. He was seen on HBO's \\"Real Sports\\" saying that Harbaugh \\"wore out his welcome\\" and that he might be \\"clinically insane.\\" 2009 season After being signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent following the 2009 NFL Draft, Boone was released on the final day of roster cuts. He was subsequently signed to the practice squad. On January 6, 2010, he was signed to the active roster and spent the entire season on the 49ers practice squad. 2010 season In the offseason following his rookie season, Boone returned home to Lakewood, Ohio, where he began working out with former NFL Pro Bowl center LeCharles Bentley.

In Week 15, Boone and the offensive line prevented quarterback Alex Smith from getting sacked in a 20-3 win on Monday Night Football (MNF) against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 2012 season In the 2012 season, Boone exceeded expectations by becoming a starter, and by performing at or near Pro Bowl caliber levels.https://sports.yahoo.com/news/most-underpaid-players-nfl-233000592-- nfl.html One journalist called Boone one of the most underpaid players in the NFL. Boone and the whole 49ers offensive line won the 2012 Madden Most Valuable Protectors of the Year Award, recognizing the best offensive line in the league. In Week 1, Boone made his first career NFL start against the Green Bay Packers, lining up at right guard and helping running back Frank Gore rush for 112 yards. In Week 4, he paved the way as the team rushed for 245 yards on 44 carries as nine different players carried the ball against the New York Jets. In the 49ers blowout win over the Buffalo Bills the following week, he helped the offense set a team record with 621 total yards (311 rushing, 310 passing), surpassing the 49ers previous franchise record of 598 against Buffalo set on September 13, 1992.

The performance earned the O-Line the Madden Most Valuable Protectors Award for Week 12. In the postseason, Boone was part of the offensive line in the NFC Divisional game against the Green Bay Packers that helped the 49ers become the first team in NFL history to have two 100-yard rushers in quarterback Colin Kaepernick (181 yards) and veteran running back Frank Gore (119 yards) and one 100-yard receiver in wideout Michael Crabtree (119 yards) in a playoff game in NFL history.

Colin Kaepernick threw for 302 yards, Frank Gore added 110 yards on the ground, Michael Crabtree tallied 109 receiving yards and Vernon Davis recorded 104 yards. 2013 season Before the 2013 season, Jeff Deeney of Pro Football Focus (PFF) named Boone the 49ers' secret superstar for his performance in 2012. Deeney stated: \\"Boone was a force in the running game as his +18.6 run blocking grade was best among all right guards. He also ranked second among all guards by receiving a negative grade on only 4.7% of his run blocks. Boone also held his own in the passing game as he earned a +2.1 rating during the regular season, and his 20 QB pressures allowed tied him for 17th lowest out of 50 guards who played at least 400 passing snaps.\\" Coming off a solid 2012 season, Boone bulked up to 315 pounds to prepare for a breakout season. In the season opener against the Green Bay Packers, he was part of an offensive line that helped amass the second most total net yards on opening day in 49ers franchise history with 494 yards (404 passing and 90 rushing). On September 13, 2013, Boone expressed displeasure with an illegal and fine-inducing hit performed by Packers linebacker Clay Matthews III on Colin Kaepernick, stating that if he was in charge of punitive actions he would not fine Matthews, but instead \\"probably punch Matthews in the face\\".http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000243737/article/alex-boone-id- like-to-punch-clay-matthews-in-the-face In Week 4, he helped pave the way for 219 yards rushing in the victory at St Louis, which marked the first time the 49ers had three different running backs score a rushing touchdown in the same game since December 2, 2001 against Buffalo. The offensive line did not allow a sack on 17 total attempts by quarterbacks Colin Kaepernick and Colt McCoy in the win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 8. The 49ers also rushed for 221 yards and 4 touchdowns on 38 carries against the Jaguars, the most rushing yards in a game by the team during the 2013 season. In Week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons, he provided great running lanes for the offense to gain 199 rushing yards on 30 attempts.

His new contract increased his total pay for 2014 and 2015 from a combined $3.7 million to $6 million, as well as, prevented the 49ers from franchising him after deal is completed. He helped pave the way for the 49ers offense to rush for a season high 218 yards on 42 attempts with 5.2 avg. against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 28. He also helped the 49ers offense hold the ball for 42:17 minutes, which was the highest time of possession for the team since the 2011 season against Arizona (44:16).

Chronotron launched on the Kongregate website in May 2008. It is notable for having been selected as one of ten games in the PAX 10 2008 out of over eighty entries. It has been described as innovative. The protagonist is a robot named Chronotron who travels back in time to cooperate with himself. (Excerpted from the television program X-Play. The main character must fetch an item before moving to the next room. Solving the puzzles requires sending the main character back in time to coordinate with previous selves. The gameplay requires thinking ahead. Chronotron records the control input, not the protagonist's position. As a result, actions by later selves can interfere with earlier selves. A number of web sites have licensed Chronotron, including Kongregate and MTV's AddictingGames. It was featured on the front page of Kongregate. The game appears on over 2,000 web sites and has been played more than seven million times. Archived from here on 2008-10-26. The developer splits advertising revenue evenly with Kongregate and made more than $1,000 in 2008. The developer had made nearly $15,000 in profits from the game in 2008. Development Chronotron was developed by Madison, Wisconsin based Scarybug Games, which consists of a single person: Joe Rheaume. Rheaume was the sole developer of Chronotron. Development for Chronotron took seven months. Chronotron's sponsorship support was handled through FlashGameLicense.com. Interest in sponsoring Chronotron allowed Scarybug Games to hire Romanian artist Bogdan Ene to replace the graphics. Royalty free music was purchased for the game. The music's author is Helge Krabye. Sound effects came from the Freesound Project. Chronotron credits screen. Chronotron's time travel elements was inspired by advertising for the Xbox game Blinx: The Time Sweeper and an article on Braid. Rheaume claims to not have played Blinx. Chronotron was released before the release of Braid. Rheaume claims to have \\"thought of the idea of recording input and going back looping on yourself.\\" Rheaume wanted there to be no limit on how many times you could travel back in time. The game contains references to time travel stories including Back to the Future, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, and Doctor Who. The puzzle platformer elements were inspired by The Lost Vikings. Rheaume notes the similarity between cooperating with your self to the cooperation between the three Vikings in The Lost Vikings. Puzzle pacing, with later puzzles building on what is learned earlier, was inspired by Portal. Portal also inspired the use of humorous signs in game as hints. Rheaume is a Flash developer for his day job. Chronotron was built as a hobby. As a hobby, Rheaume can develop ideas which don't fit the ideas, time constraints, and budgets of his regular job's client projects. Chronotron was developed because Rheaume thought it would be fun to play. Rheaume developed it further because he \\"thought it really had legs.\\" Interest from other people kept Rheaume going. The name of the game and the protagonist comes from \\"chrono\\" for \\"time\\" and \\"tron\\" as a generic term for \\"robot.\\" Reception The game was selected as one of the ten games for the prestigious PAX 10 in 2008. Joe Rheaume was an invited guest to show Chronotron to the Penny Arcade Expo in 2008 as part of the PAX 10. Chronotron was selected as one of ten games from over eighty submitted.

He is the co-producer of both Heavyweight Dub Champion studio albums and is main creator of the band's philosophical ideology defined by the Last Champion Manifesto, a booklet included with the 2002 album, Survival Guide For The End of Time. Chambers now lives in San Francisco, CA and performs and produces for Heavyweight Dub Champion and Liberation Movement, among others. Early Years Chambers grew up mostly near Baltimore, MD, but lived in multiple countries where his father, a college professor, had visiting fellowships. As a teen, he promoted punk concerts and frequented the D.C. punk scene. His father, Dr. Robert H. Chambers III was president of McDaniel College from 1984‚Äì2000. In 1988, as a high school junior, he promoted a punk concert in the basement of the McDaniel College President's house. The event space was known as The Dungeon and the inaugural event was featured on the front page of the Carroll County Times. He went on to promote concerts with DC hardcore punk groups Government Issue and M.F.D. among others. Chambers attended University at McDaniel College in Maryland, Harlaxton College in Grantham, England and received a degree in Religious Studies from University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1995, while living in Boulder, Colorado, he founded hip hop reggae group Roots Revolt. Many of the key players in Roots Revolt would later show up on Heavyweight Dub Champion recordings, including HDC co- founder Patch Rubin.  Heavyweight Dub Champion  Heavyweight Dub Champion was founded in Gold Hill, CO in 1997 and played its first show on October 31, 1997. In 2005, the band relocated to San Francisco. With Heavyweight Dub Champion, Chambers has produced two albums as Resurrector, 2002's Survival Guide For The End of Time and 2009's Rise of the Champion Nation, featuring multiple tracks with KRS-One. HDC has performed throughout the US, Canada and Europe. As described by Marquee Magazine, \\"The live performance is referred to as the ‚ÄòLiberation Process‚Äô because it's intended that the music can put the audience in something like a vibratory trance and can remove layers of deception through the music.\\" According to a review in the La Weekly, \\"Their genius is the great virtue of ‚Äô70s dub: never overdoing it.\\" Another review says HDC, \\"sounds something like hip-hop colliding with dub inside the eye of an electronica hurricane.\\" =Survival Guide For The End Of Time= In 2002, HDC released their debut album, Survival Guide For The End of Time- \\"an ill- bent mix of industrial apocalyptic hip-hop dubtronica\\" that \\"aims to topple the foundations of modern-day Babylon\\" as well as offering \\"prescriptions for survival and victory in a tension-filled time.\\" The album was recorded and mixed in Colorado and Los Angeles and \\"can safely be called a concept album\\". As described by Resurrector, Survival Guide \\"relates to the coming of the Last Champion, an interdimensional spiritual warrior, who is bringing people together throughout the world to try to elevate consciousness in a way that will focus people on the healing of themselves and the healing of the world, and help put people in a more offensive position.\\" Survival Guide has an ambitious package including the band's credo, Last Champion Manifesto, a 70-page booklet \\"detailing their mission of 'Unconditional Liberation of the Human Race,'‚ÄùPlanet News Article, Jackson Hole Wy  Improv meets electronica in Heavyweight Dub Champion; JHSO, brass 5tet play Center Theater  1/2/2008 .

Everything we do is related to the manifesto. Every album will be that way,\\" says Chambers. There are seven chapters broken into mini-chapters named after the songs on Survival Guide and 2008's Rise of the Champion Nation. Each album serves as a sort of soundtrack to elements presented in the booklet. Songs relate to actions such as the Arrival, which was remixed by San Francisco's award-winning favorite Bassnectar, \\"Liberation Process\\", \\"Exorcism\\" and so on. Most of the themes relate to becoming a Warrior and the development of the \\"Last Champion's Chosen Army\\" known as \\"Champion Nation\\", which is also the name of the record label founded by Chambers. =Rise Of The Champion Nation= Heavyweight Dub Champion's follow up album (a \\"limited edition\\" was released at shows in Fall of 2008) includes guest appearances and endorsements from KRS-One, who states in the title track, \\"Heavyweight Dub Champion restores all hope\\", Killah Priest and Brooklyn Dub pioneer Dr. Israel, in addition to the familiar cast of A.P.O.S.T.L.E. and others. The project was mixed by Bill Laswell's veteran engineer Oz Fritz and is mastered by industry favorite Brian Gardner. Rise is described by one reviewer as \\"a rock-opera (or hip-hop opera) of sorts ‚Äì a concept album of the highest sorts ‚Äì and almost cinematic in its mostly dark themes and structure.\\" The album is conceptual following \\"the Warrior\\" from the Arrival, through Warrior Divination One, Two and Three, to emerge as King Of The Mountain and the eventual journey ends with Promised Land.

Liberation Movement Reality Sandwich calls Liberation Movement \\"a new collaborative music project that pushes the boundaries of human experience\\". Liberation Movement was developed out of experiences Chambers had working with the Shipibo Tribe in Peru. It was formed in 2010 in San Francisco. Chambers explains in an interview, \\"The project was seeded at the Temple of the Way of Light in the Peruvian Amazon, at which point I was recruited to work with and create recordings of shamans in traditional ceremonies in Peru. From that foundation, I wanted to start gathering artists and musicians that represent \\"archetypal gateways\\" ; veterans in different musical fields whose goal is to connect with the deepest life journey.\\" He says he chose the name because \\"speaking the name is a revolutionary potential in and of itself. Resurrector explains his work in Liberation Movement: Resurrector and Maestra Olivia Ar√©valo Lomas in Peru, 2011 =Work with the Shipibo Tribe of the Peruvian Amazon= In 2010, Chambers \\"went to Peru to learn about how music and vibration are connected to shamanism\\". This led to him recording more than 25 indigenous singers from the Shipibo Tribe at the Temple Of The Way Of Light near Iquitos, Peru and produce and release the album On√°yabaon Bew√° ‚Äì Messages from Mother Earth by Shamans of the Temple of the Way of Light. In 2014, in collaboration with Peruvian-based NGO Alianza Arkana and the Rubin Foundation, he led Liberation Movement to Peru with bandmates Sasha Rose, Noah King and filmmakers Mitch Schultz (Writer/Director of DMT: The Spirit Molecule), Donald Schultz and Jason Gamble Harter to document a concert and surrounding journeys to villages along the Amazon River. Mitch Schultz stated, \\"Cross-cultural interfaces are paramount for accessing indigenous knowledge through a modern lens, or in this case the musical experience of Liberation Movement.\\" =\\"Jiwexon Axebo\\" Concert= On May 2, 2014, Liberation Movement collaborated on a concert with Peruvian-based NGO Alianza Arkana called \\"Jiwexon Axebo\\" in the Shipibo Tribe's language and \\"Cultural Revival\\" in English. They \\"performed to 600 indigenous Peruvians\\"in the town square of Yarinacocha in Pucallpa, Peru and had two indigenous shamans perform with them. Also performing at the concert was a local Cumbia orchestra called Sensac√¨on Shipibo. The event was described as \\"a progressive leap forward, bringing together cultures in a productive and creative light and working together for a common purpose- the preservation of the rainforest, its people and traditions.\\" =Olivia Ar√©valo Lomas= Often heralded as the leader and \\"spiritual mother\\" of the indigenous Shipibo-konibo community, Maestra Olivia Ar√©valo Lomas who both performed and recorded with Liberation Movement was tragically murdered in April 2018 at her home. She is featured on the Resurrector produced album On√°yabaon Bew√° ‚Äì Messages from Mother Earth. =Live Performance= Liberation Movement has received many accolades for its live performances and they have performed at festivals throughout the Americas including Lightning in a Bottle, Symbiosis Gathering, Sonic Bloom, Joshua Tree Music Festival, Envision in Costa Rica, Atmosphere Gathering in Canada and many others. A review by Everest.com of their performance at the Oregon Eclipse Festival in 2017 stated that Liberation Movement, \\"shone brightest among the Earth Stage's magnificent programming... Resurrector himself, Grant Chambers, provided a veritable s√©ance in deep dubby beat-science... This was a spiritualized journey that burrowed many thousands of leagues beneath the Earth's surface, penetrating the consciousness of all who had assembled.\\" Liberation Movement live performances often feature a wide variety of collaborators and guests from varied genres including Peruvian shamans, champion Tuvan throat singer Soriah, Butoh dance troupe Bad Unkl Sista, SORNE and many others. Liberation Movement performing in Pucallpa, Peru with Maestro Diogenes Garcia in 2014  Ideology  Resurrector focuses on ideological perspectives in many of his interviews on behalf of his projects. He often speaks about music being Sonic Shamanistic Alchemy and the members of Heavyweight Dub Champion are often referred to as Sonic Shamanistic Alchemists. He defines the process as, \\"basically taking a range of vibrational materials, from tribal instruments to electronic instruments, and manipulating them through devices like tape delays and old analog stomp boxes to try to find the personality of each piece... looking for particular voices, particular vibrations that would contribute to the spectrum of sound we're trying to bring forth, a spectrum of liberational revolutionary energy. Whatever we do with a sound, we have a specific mission: to change the chemistry of the planet leading to unconditional liberation of the human race.\\" A defining quotation written by Resurrector that is often used to represent his projects is \\"the liberation process is in full effect\\".

The film won an AFI award. Plot Vinnie is a teenage boy who is an outcast at school, alienating teachers and students alike. He is a local courier for the local Mafia boss. He lives in welfare housing with his mother (Peta Toppano), a young brother and sister, and his Mum's lover who he can't stand. Vinnie takes out his aggression with the world practicing boxing at the local gym. He is haunted by images of his father (when just a boy he witnessed his father's murder) and his father's boxing career.

Production Colosimo, Sardi and Pattinson had previously made Moving Out (1982). When making that film Sardi and Pattinson discovered music teachers would help underprivileged children by encouraging them to become involved in music, which inspired this film. Pattinson took the script to Bonnie Harris of Roadshow Entertainment, who got Paul Dainty involved. The movie was a conscious effort on the part of Pattinson and Sardi to make something more commercial than their first film, while still having something based in reality.Debi Enker, \\"Michael Pattinson and Jan Sardi\\", Cinema Papers, October 1984 p315-318, 383 The director later admitted that the choice of music used in the film - including Leo Sayer, Sharon O'Neill and Dragon - was \\"maybe a bit too middle of the road\\".

The former runway can be seen left-centre The hospital is a key part of the Hengrove Park Regeneration Project that will include a new Skills Academy, a sports and leisure centre, corporate headquarters and transport infrastructure improvements. There had been debate about a new hospital for South Bristol for a considerable time. The last plans by Bristol and Weston Health Authority were shelved in the late 1980s. The current development comes from plans instituted by Bristol Health Services Plan in 2000. Planning permission for the hospital was granted in March 2008. The NHS South West board approved the ¬£54 million facility in January 2009. The hospital was developed by NHS Bristol in conjunction with Bristol Infracare LIFT Ltd, a public-private partnership setup to provide new healthcare facilities in Bristol. Final go ahead was given in early 2010. The ground-cutting ceremony was held on 5 March 2010. Construction, which cost ¬£45 million, was completed in the spring of 2012, although not all services were operating in March 2012. The hospital provides a minor injuries unit, an out-of-hours GP service, day surgery facilities, stroke rehabilitation, medical imaging and dental facilities. It replaces outdated facilities at Bristol General Hospital. On 7 January 2013, the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital moved its operations from Cotham House to the hospital, but homeopathy services ceased in October 2015, when the Portland Centre took over the service.

The agent is known by multiple synonyms and is technically classified as a vesicant, or blister agent. History PD was prepared during 1917‚Äì18 in Germany and France, during World War II it was prepared in Germany. Chemical characteristicsGeneral= Phenyldichloroarsine is an odorless, colorless substance that can form hydrochloric acid upon contact with water. The reaction with water is very slow, the substance sinks, and the reaction is considered non- hazardous.Pohanish, Richard P. HazMat Data, (Google Books), Wiley-IEEE, 2005, pp. 895-96, (). Another product of hydrolysis is phenylarsenious acid, which is a severe irritant to the mucous membranes and skin.Leikin, Jarrold B. and McFee, Robin B. Handbook of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Agent Exposures, (Google Books), Informa Health Care, 2007, pp. 356-57, (). In an impure state, phenyldichloroarsine may have a slight brown color, in its purest form though there is no color and the substance has an oily texture. An impure solution of PD also emits a characteristically unpleasant horseradish or garlic-like odor, which is detectable at 0.1 ppm.Ellison, Hank D. Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, (Google Books), CRC Press, 2007, p. 156, (). Phenyldichloroarsine is one of four organic arsenicals, the other three are lewisite (L), methyldichloroarsine (MD), and ethyldichloroarsine (ED).Fitzgerald, Geoffrey M. and Vollmer, Timothy. \\"CBRNE - Vesicants, Organic Arsenicals: L, ED, MD, PD, HL\\", emedicine via WebMD, June 19, 2006, accessed December 22, 2008. PD is considered an analog of lewisite. At its freezing point, -20 ¬∞C, PD becomes a microcrystalline solid mass.Hills, Terry. The Illustrated Dictionary of Organic Chemistry, (Google Books), Lotus Press, Tokyo: 2007, p. 149, (). The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the phenyl group and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.Manahan, Stanley E. Industrial Ecology: Environmental Chemistry and Hazardous Waste, (Google Books), CRC Press, 1999, p. 189, (). =Synthesis= Phenyldichloroarsine is produced by reacting benzene with arsenic trichloride. Anhydrous aluminum chloride acts as a catalyst in this reaction.Ledgard, Jared. A Laboratory History of Chemical Warfare Agents, (Google Books), Lulu.com, 2006, pp. 127-29, (). Uses Phenyldichloroarsine is an obsolete chemical warfare agent and is classified as a vesicant or a vomiting/incapacitating agent. It was used as a weapon during World War I, where it showed itself as less effective than other vomiting agents.Cashman, John R. Emergency Response Handbook for Chemical and Biological Agents and Weapons, (Google Books), CRC Press, 2008, pp. 215-19, (). Phenyldichloroarsine is an arsenical vesicant which can be mixed with mustard agents for use in chemical warfare.Dire, Daniel J. \\"CBRNE - Vesicants, Mustard: Hd, Hn1-3, H\\", emedicine via WebMD, December 21, 2007, accessed December 22, 2008. PD was developed for use in wet environments, because of its tendency to persist in cool and shaded areas. Phenyldichloroarsine can have a persistence lasting anywhere from 2 to 7 days under usual environmental conditions. In open areas, it is more useful as a vomiting agent but in closed-in areas, such as basements, trenches and caves, it is highly effective because of its \\"extreme\\" vapor density. Phenyldichloroarsine has also been used by banks and other high-security facilities to defend against security breaches. Biological effects PD damages the eyes, lungs, throat and nasal membranes. PD immediately affects the eyes and blindness can result, though it requires high doses. It also induces nausea and vomiting, an inhalation of as little as 5-50 milligrams can induce severe vomiting. Long-term exposure to PD can cause systemic damage by replacing calcium with arsenic, extensive bone marrow damage can also result. Due to PD being easily recognized in the field and a relatively fast rate for decontamination procedures to become effective, the chemical is not as useful as other blister agents. The blistering resultant from PD exposure may also be delayed, for as little as 30 minutes,O'Connor,, Richard J., McGown, Evelyn L., Dill, Kilian. \\"Interaction of Phenyldicholoroarsine with Biological Molecules\\", Department of Chemistry - Clemson University for U.S. Army, Letterman Army Institute of Research, August 1986, accessed December 22, 2008. or as long as 32 hours depending upon the concentration of the dose. The molecular toxicology of PD is not well understood, but a 1986 U.S. Army-sponsored report did shed some light on that area. The Army report showed that PD penetrated the red blood cell membrane and interacted with something inside the cell. The study also found that hemoglobin was not responsible for \\"holding\\" the PD in its bond with the erythrocytes (red blood cells), instead glutathione was found to be a more likely interacting with PD inside the cell .Byrnes, Mark E. et al.

Performing primarily in duets, May won several national and international events. Because of his gender, May was not allowed to compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Early career May was born in Syracuse, New York. He became interested in synchronized swimming when he was 10 years old while living in Syracuse, after watching his sister in a beginning class. He explained why he became involved, \\"I did competitive swimming there and the synchro class was right after it, so we couldn't go home until she was done. It was either try it with her or sit outside the pool and watch her, so my mom told me to try it, just to be in the water and be doing something.\\" May began taking lessons and later performed with a local team, the Syracuse Synchro Cats. After the Synchro Cats disbanded, he performed with the Oswego Lakettes. In 1996, at age 16, May moved to Santa Clara, California. He tried out for the Santa Clara Aquamaids, one of the top synchronized swimming programs in the United States, and was accepted into the junior A squad. May eventually was promoted to the Aquamaid's top \\"A\\" squad. Competition Teaming with partner Kristina Lum, May won the duet event at the 1998 US national championships. The pair then won the silver medal in the event at the 1998 Goodwill Games. Because May is male, he was barred from competing in the 1999 Pan American Games. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) allowed May to compete in its sanctioned events. In 1999, May finished first in duet at the Swiss Open and French Open. He won the Grand Slam at the 2000 Jantzen Nationals and was named the US Synchronized Swimming Athlete of the Year in 1998 and 1999. A hopeful for the 2004 Summer Olympics, May was not allowed to compete after the United States Synchronized Swimming Federation (USSSF) declined to ask for inclusion of a mixed pairs event at the games. Said May, \\"It was a huge disappointment and it was very humbling. ... It's a political sport in that it's kind of like a clique at school.\\" Replied Ginny Jasontek, President of the USSSF, \\"We cannot allow men in a women's sport.\\" Later career In 2008, May performed in Cirque du Soleil's water-based show, O. He was paid $100 for each performance. Comeback to the sport With the mixed duet added to the World Championship program, Bill May returned to the sport after a 10-year retirement. On July 26, 2015 he became the first man ever to win a Synchronized swimming gold at a major event, such as an Olympic or World Championships, by winning the mixed duet technical routine gold, with his partner Christina Jones at the World Aquatic Championships in Kazan, Russia.

The success of the expedition led to the award of this honour to units of the British Indian Army which had participated in the campaign. The units belonged, with the exception of the Madras Sappers, to the Bengal and Bombay Presidency Armies. The Abyssinian Campaign of 1868 A diplomatic contretemps by the British Foreign Office led to a rupture of relations between Britain and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian monarch Tewodros had imprisoned a number of Europeans, mostly British and German, including the British Consul, Charles Duncan Cameron, in 1864. A diplomatic mission led by Hormuzd Rassam to gain their freedom, which entered the country in 1866 after numerous delays, met the same fate. In order to obtain their release and punish the offender, an expeditionary force consisting of units from the Bombay and Bengal Armies was despatched from Bombay. The force disembarked on the Red Sea south of Massawa in 1868, traversed 500 kilometres using native labour for road construction, crossed mountain ranges as high as 2,970 metres to storm the Imperial fortress at Magdala to release the prisoners. In the end, only a brief battle was fought against the men who were still loyal to Tewodros, two of the British soldiers wounded in the attack would later die from their injuries, the only other British Forces' deaths were due to disease . The Emperor committed suicide and the force withdrew.Singh, Sarbans (1993) Battle Honours of the Indian Army 1757 - 1971. pp Expeditionary Force The Abyssinian expedition of 1868 was led by an engineer officer, Lieutenant General Sir Robert Napier, then Commander-in-Chief, Bombay. The strength of the expeditionary force amounted to 14,000 men comprising four and a half regiments of cavalry, seven batteries and one Indian company of artillery, four battalions of British infantry and ten of Indian infantry. The Engineers consisted of seven Companies of Sappers and Miners. There were four companies of Bombay Sappers and Miners under Captain (afterwards Major General) AR MacDonnell, namely Numbers 1,2,3 and 4 (that is 17, 18, 19 and 20 Field Companies). The Madras Sapper companies were G, H and K Companies. Also included was the 10th Company of the Royal Engineers. Military Account On 16 September 1867, a reconnoitering party sailed from Bombay. The 3rd and 4th Companies of Bombay Sappers with an advanced brigade from Bombay reached Zula on 21 October and set to work at once to build a pier at the beach. A camp was made about one mile from the sea and 20 wells were erected. The Sappers were also tasked for improving the existing track to Senafe. When the whole force was assembled, they started advancing into the hinterland. The engineering difficulties in reaching Senafe were enormous with high mountains lying ahead. The Sappers were engaged for six weeks in making a road 10 feet wide, in some places it was carried over enormous granite boulders, by ramps. The force arrived at Senafe on 29 January 1868 and on 26 February, the main body marched from Adigrat and through the good work of a 'Pioneer' force, which included the Bombay Sappers, reached the neighbourhood of Antalo in March. The advance was resumed over increasingly barren and difficult country, where altitudes exceeded 2,900 metres, until at last General Napier arrived at Arogye, a plain at the foot of Magdala on 12 April, where the British could see the way barred, by many thousands of armed Abyssinians camped around the hillsides, with up to 30 artillery pieces. The Emperor ordered an attack, with many thousands of soldiers armed with little more than spears. The 4th Regiment of Foot quickly redeployed to meet the charging mass of warriors and poured a devastating fire into their ranks. When two Indian infantry regiments contributed their firepower, the onslaught became even more devastating. Despite this, the Abyssinian soldiers continued their attack, losing over 500 with thousands more wounded during the ninety minutes of fighting, most of them at little over 30 yards from the British lines. During the chaotic battle an advance guard unit of the 33rd Regiment overpowered some of the Abyssinian artillerymen and captured their artillery pieces. The surviving Abyssinian soldiers then retreated back onto Magdala. Magdala, sentry post over gate The following day the advance was resumed with 3,500 men against the stronghold of Magdala which was perched high on a mountain of granite and had only two entry gates. In the assault on 13 April, the Engineers led the way along a path on the side of the precipice towards one of the gates. On reaching the gate there was a pause in the advance as it was discovered the engineer unit had forgotten their powder kegs and scaling ladders and were ordered to return for them. General Staveley was not happy at any further delay and ordered the 33rd Regiment to continue the attack. Several officers and the men of the 33rd, along with an officer from the Royal Engineers, parted from the main force and, after climbing the cliff face, found their way blocked by a thorny hedge over a wall. Private James Bergin, a very tall man, used his bayonet to cut a hole in the hedge and Drummer Michael Magner climbed onto his shoulders through the hedge in the gap and dragged Private Bergin up behind him as Ensign Conner and Corporal Murphy helped shove from below. Bergin kept up a rapid rate of fire on the Koket-Bir as Magnar dragged more men through the gap in the hedge. As more men poured through and opened fire, they advanced with their bayonets fixed, the defenders withdrew through the second gate. The party rushed the Koket-bir before it was fully closed and then took the second gate breaking through to the amba. Ensign Wynter scrambled up onto the top of the second gate and fixed the 33rd Regimental Colours to show the plateau had been taken. Private Bergin and Drummer Magner were later awarded the Victoria Cross for their part in the action.London Gazette, 28 July 1868 Tewodros II was found dead inside the second gate, having shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. When his death was announced all resistance ceased. His body was cremated and buried inside the church by the priests. The church was guarded by soldiers from the 33rd Regiment Our Soldiers, by W.H.G. Kingston - Battle of Magdala, page 194 although, according to Henry M. Stanley, looted of \\"an infinite variety of gold, and silver and brass crosses\\". Battle Honour The honour was awarded vide Gazette of India No 1181 of 1869. It is not considered repugnant.

In the early hours of 23 December 2008, Aboubacar Sompar√©, the President of the National Assembly, announced on television that Cont√© had died at 6:45 pm local time the previous day \\"after a long illness.\\" While Sompar√© did not name the particular illness, sources reported that Cont√© had chronic diabetes and leukemia. According to the Constitution, the President of the National Assembly is to assume the Presidency in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election is to be held within 60 days. Sompar√© requested that the President of the Supreme Court, Lamine Sidim√©, declare a vacancy in the Presidency and apply the Constitution. Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souar√© and General Diarra Camara, the head of the army, stood alongside Sompar√© during his announcement. Declaring 40 days of national mourning for Cont√©, Souar√© urged \\"calm and restraint\\". He told the army to secure the borders and maintain calm within the country \\"in homage to the memory of the illustrious late leader\\". Government officials met at the People's Palace, seat of the National Assembly, in the early hours of 23 December. Prime Minister Souar√©, Sompar√©, the President of the Supreme Court, and military leaders were present. Speaking to Radio France Internationale after Cont√©'s death, opposition leader Jean-Marie Dor√© of the Union for the Progress of Guinea stressed that the institutions of state must \\"be able to work to prevent unnecessary disorder in Guinea which would add to the current difficult situation\\". Announcement of coup d'√©tat Six hours after Sompar√© announced Cont√©'s death, a statement was read on state radio announcing a military coup d'√©tat. This statement, read by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara on behalf of a group called the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD), said that \\"the government and the institutions of the Republic have been dissolved.\\" The statement also announced the suspension of the constitution \\"as well as political and union activity.\\" According to Captain Camara, the coup was necessary due to Guinea's \\"deep despair\\" amidst rampant poverty and corruption, and he said that the existing institutions were \\"incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country.\\" Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as Prime Minister at the head of a new government that would be ethnically balanced. The National Council for Democracy and Development would, according to Camara, include 26 officers as well as six civilians.\\"Coup attempt in Guinea after president dies\\", AFP, 23 December 2008. Reporting from Conakry at the time of the coup announcement, Alhassan Sillah of the BBC said that the situation in the city was \\"unusually quiet\\" and that he had not seen any soldiers. Later in the day, several tanks were seen in the city.\\"Coup declared in Guinea after dictator's death\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 24 December 2008. Following Camara's announcement, Souar√© said the government and state institutions were intact. According to Souar√©, he did not know who was behind the coup attempt, but he said that he was \\"sure that they will see reason. They have not used force. There has been no threat against anybody.\\" Sompar√©, meanwhile, called the coup attempt \\"a setback for our country\\" and expressed hope that it would not succeed. He argued that most soldiers were still loyal to the government. It was reported that soldiers at the Alfa Yaya Diallo military camp had chosen a lieutenant-colonel, S√©kouba Konat√©, as leader of the coup attempt, although some soldiers objected because they believed a higher-ranking officer should have been chosen. The chief of the armed forces, General Diarra Camara, said that the coup plotters represented only a minority of the army.\\"Guinea coup plotters 'a minority'\\" BBC News, 23 December 2008 In the afternoon of 23 December, amidst confusion about who was in control of the country, Gen. Camara asked that the soldiers \\"at least wait until after [Cont√©'s] funeral\\", while also stating that he was not trying to prevent anyone's ambitions. On 23 December, both the office of the Prime Minister and the Little Palace, Cont√©'s former residence, were reported to be under the control of the coup leaders.\\"Economie et Politique : Le petit palais et la Primature sous contr√¥le des putchistes.

According to Sompar√©, the leaders of the coup held a meeting to choose an interim leader for the country late on 23 December; he said that Moussa Camara, S√©kouba Konat√©, and Toto Camara were considered candidates for the position. The composition of the CNDD was announced late on 23 December;\\"Economie et Politique : Liste des membres du CNDD\\" , Guineenews, 23 December 2008 . it included 32 members, 26 of whom were officers and six of whom were civilians.\\"Guinea coup leaders name council\\", BBC News, 24 December 2008.

Later in the day, Camara and thousands of soldiers loyal to him paraded through the city, surrounded by large numbers of civilian supporters. According to Camara, he \\"came to see if the terrain is favorable to us\\", declaring that the large crowds indicated that the people were indeed supportive of the coup. Also on 24 December, Camara said in a radio broadcast that the CNDD did not want to stay in power indefinitely and that it intended to lead the country for two years, promising \\"credible and transparent presidential elections by the end of December 2010\\". This contradicted an earlier statement promising an election within the constitutionally mandated period of 60 days.\\"Guinea coup leader parades through capital\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 25 December 2008. The CNDD declared an 8 pm to 6:30 am nationwide curfew, although it said that the curfew would not be implemented until 26 December to avoid interfering with the Christian celebration of Christmas.\\"Coup leaders tighten grip in Guinea\\", AFP, 24 December 2008. The extent of the CNDD's control remained unclear on 24 December; although Prime Minister Souar√© had gone into hiding, he insisted that the government had not been toppled. Souar√© described Camara as \\"an unknown captain [who] doesn't control the army\\" and argued again that most troops were loyal, while attributing the \\"disorder\\" to \\"one little group\\". Shortly after the CNDD ordered all members of the government and army officers to go to the Alpha Yaya Diallo military camp within 24 hours, with the threat of \\"a sweep of the entire national territory\\" if they did not. Prime Minister Souar√© went to the camp and turned himself in on 25 December,\\"Guinea PM turns himself in at military camp\\", AFP, 25 December 2008. together with all the members of his government except for two ministers who were, according to Souar√©, on official missions abroad.\\"Economie et Politique : Apr√®s une petite r√©sistance,l'ancien gouvernement fait all√©geance : \\"Nous sommes √† votre disposition\\",dixit Souar√©\\" , Guineenews, 25 December 2008 .

He also addressed Camara as \\"President\\". Speaking on the radio on 25 December, Camara said that he did not plan to run for President at the end of the two year transitional period. He also declared that the CNDD was not susceptible to bribes. According to Camara, people had \\"start[ed] to show up with bags of money to try to corrupt us. They've tried to give money to our wives and cars to our children.\\" He warned that he would \\"personally go after anyone who tries to corrupt us\\". Camara also said that Cont√©'s funeral on 26 December (several days late) would be \\"grandiose\\", and he expressed disapproval in describing the lack of proper care for Cont√©'s body.\\"Coup leader consolidates position in Guinea\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 25 December 2008.

In the early 19th century, the French operated a mine near the village, presumably for coal. Today the excavations and tailings from the mine can still be seen in the woods on the way to ≈Ωlebe. Cultural heritage There is a stone bridge across Mavel≈°ƒçica Creek; it is a special feature of the municipality because in the past it was part of an important north-south transit route known as the \\"Ljubelj Road\\" connecting Salzburg and Aquileia. Because of this special function the bridge was built with special care, with large stones specially fitted to one another. The year 1666 is carved on the bridge. The bridge is occasionally referred to as \\"Napoleon's Bridge\\"; although Napoleon likely crossed it, its construction had nothing to do with the movement of French troops because it predates the Napoleonic campaign by a century and a half. Circa 1970 the bridge was registered as Yugoslav cultural heritage with the highest level of protection through the efforts of Marko Mu≈°iƒç. The bridge was renovated in the early 1980s. Today it is part of a protected complex together with a nearby chestnut plantation.

The measure is a technical fix designed to remove inoperative provisions in the Oregon Constitution which barred those under 21 from voting in school board elections and required voters to be able to pass a literacy test to vote in school district elections. This measure appeared on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon. It was passed by voters, receiving 72.59% of the vote. HistoryBackground= In 1948, voters passed a ballot measure amending the Oregon Constitution to require that in order to vote in school elections citizens must meet certain qualifications. Those qualifications were set forth in section 6, Article VIII of the Oregon Constitution, and included requirements that a citizen be at least 21 years old, have resided in the school district for at least six months before the election and have registered for the election. A citizen meeting these qualifications would also only be allowed to vote in the school election if they could also read and write English. Later developments in voting rights laws and in court decisions have made each of those requirements unconstitutional or a violation of federal law. The 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents denial or abridgment of the voting rights of a citizen 18 years of age or older. Federal court decisions have held that residency requirements of the type which were set forth in section 6, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 generally prohibits literacy tests as a condition for eligibility to vote. Because of this, Oregon‚Äôs Attorney General in 1972, Lee Johnson, held that the requirements under section 6 were unenforceable. =Path to the ballot= The move to put this measure before the voters began when in the spring of 2006 when the Grant High School Constitution Team in Portland were meeting to continue its preparations for the Center for Civic Education's annual We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution competition, in which knowledge of the U.S. Constitution is tested in a simulated congressional hearing. While attending the Grant Constitutional Team meeting Roy Pulvers, a Portland attorney and the father of one of the students, brought up the provisions of Article VIII, Section 6 in the Oregon Constitution to the team and its coaches. He had been preparing for an election-law conference in Washington, D.C. he was going to be attending, and was reading through relevant Oregon statutes and constitutional provisions. He stated his belief that the requirements of Section 6 were unconstitutional. The team agreed and prompted the students to take action. At first the students considered filing a lawsuit, but dropped the idea since it was no longer being enforced. Over the course of several months the students broke into small groups and researched the issue, gathering evidence to help overturn what they believed were outdated, unfair voting restrictions still codified in Oregon's Constitution. Once they felt they had evidence, they drafted a letter outlining their case and sent it to Bill Bradbury who was then the Oregon Secretary of State. His office sent a letter to Hardy Myers, who was at that time the Oregon attorney general, to take a look at the section and give a legal opinion on the matter. The attorney general's office wrote back saying that while the section is still on the books it was inoperative. This prompted the secretary of state's office to sponsor legislation during the 2007 session of the legislature to amend the state's constitution, which became House Joint Resolution 4 (HJR 4). On January 24, 2007, lawmakers held public hearings and invited three of the students, Hannah Fisher, Ethan Gross and Pulvers' daughter Evan, to testify in front of the House Elections Committee. The bill passed the House and Senate with Rep. Jerry Krummel (R-26) of Wilsonville being the only opposing vote. This placed HJR 4 on the 2008 general election ballot as legislatively referred constitutional amendment, becoming Measure 54. Passage While there was no organized opposition to the measure, it was reported there was a theoretical problem with striking Section 6. Portland Constitutional lawyer Chuck Hinkle expressed a concern that if passed, the measure might prevent people who do not own property from voting in school district elections. The Chair of the House Elections Committee, Representative Diane Rosenbaum, dismissed such concerns. She pointed out that is not the intention of Measure 54, and that there are no plans to restrict school bond elections to taxpayers. The measure went on to be passed by voters with an overwhelming 72.59% of the vote, the second largest margin of victory in the November 2008 general election ballot.

It was led by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the United Democratic Party (UDP) who are the second and third largest parties in the 8th Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Chief Minister Dr. Donkupar Roy and the other ministers in the Government belong to the MPA. History The MPA was formed soon after the 2008 Meghalaya Legislative Assembly election when it emerged that the Indian National Congress (INC) did not have sufficient Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to form the Government. All the non-INC parties in the state decided to join hands and formed the MPA in a bid to keep the INC out of power in Meghalaya. After the elections, the Governor S. S. Sidhu invited the INC-led Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) under the leadership of D. D. Lapang to form the Government by virtue of being the largest party in the Assembly. The MPA claimed that this move by the Governor was unconstitutional since the MUA did not have sufficient majority in the Assembly. The MUA was given 10 days to prove its majority in the Assembly. As the confidence vote approached, D. D. Lapang resigned and the MPA was given the chance to form the Government. The MPA Government headed by Dr. Donkupar Roy was sworn in by Governor Sidhu on 19 March 2008 with the support of 31 members in the 60 member Assembly. The MPA have pledged to provide top priority to ensuring transparency in governance and have prepared a common minimum program that reflects promises made by each of the constituent parties in their respective poll manifestoes. Initial Support At the time of formation, the MPA included the following members: * Nationalist Congress Party(NCP) (14 MLAs) * United Democratic Party (UDP) (11 MLAs) * Hill State People's Democratic Party (HPDP) (2 MLAs) * Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) (1 MLA) * Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) (1 MLA) * independents (2 MLAs) Despite being the largest party, the NCP gave up the Chief Minister post to UDP in order to achieve stability in the Government. There are also some reports of a power- sharing agreement between the UDP and NCP to share the Chief Minister position for two and a half years each. Changes in constituents By June, the MPA was able to secure further support from 2 additional independent MLAs. This took the ruling party's count to 33 in the 60 member Assembly. Collapse In March 2009, Meghalaya was put under President's Rule. By May 2009, the United Democratic Party and the Hill State People's Democratic Party had left the Progressive Alliance, and the United Alliance returned to power with D.D. Lapang as chief minister.

Geography Sora is a clustered village at the foot of Hom Hill (718 m) on an alluvial fan above Loƒçnica Creek, where it exits a narrow valley in the hills to the southwest. The soil is loamy and fields lie below the village, extending toward the Sora River to the north. The surrounding hills are karstified and there is a large cave on Kravjek Hill. Name Sora was attested in written sources in 1154 as Zower (and as Ceur in 1161 and Zevra in 1252). The name is derived from the Sora River and comes from the archaic Slovene common noun s«´Ããv—åra from the verb *s—ä-v—årƒõti 'to pour out, boil over', referring to a flashy stream, and presumably turbulent confluences along the course of the river. In the past the German name was Zaier. History The remnants of a Roman building and graves have been found between Sora and neighboring Rakovnik, attesting to early settlement in the area. A regular school was established in Sora in 1874, and the school building was remodeled in 1907. A catchment basin for water was built below the church in 1911 at the initiative of the writer Fran Sale≈°ki Fin≈ægar. Engagements in the area during the Second World War are commemorated by a stone commemorating a fallen female Partisan along the road to Topol pri Medvodah and a monument with the names of seven fallen Partisans next to the road along Loƒçnica Creek. After the Second World War, the local school was named after the communist people's hero Avgust Barle.

Because of this media dubbed her \\"the world's fastest kid\\" during her youth. Early life and education She became interested in becoming a pilot when she met Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan at the age of three after one of their last test flights of the Rutan Voyager, the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. Her first flight as a passenger occurred when she was 5 and when she became aware of the Air Force Academy, she was determined to study there and although her admittance was delayed by a dental malocclusion she was eventually accepted. She graduated from the academy on May 31, 2006 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in behavioral science/human factors engineering. Career and records Mumaw first started piloting by competing in mock aerial combat at the age of eight and she held the record for the most victories in mock dogfights. She was also the youngest person to pilot a BD-10 (a prototype of the aircraft seen in the James Bond movie Octopussy) in 1993. On July 12, 1994, at the age of 11, Mumaw became the youngest person to fly a Mig-29 jet fighter and break the sound barrier with it. She first flew an Aero L-39 Albatros together with her instructor Vladimir Danilenko to prove she'd be able to handle the MIG safely. She satisfied the instructor and subsequently flew the MIG-29UB two-seat trainer to a speed of Mach 1.3 (940 mph). After that, she celebrated by performing a series of military-style maneuvers and aerobatics.

Summary The Tractatus was first published in 1677, the year of Spinoza's death, by some of his closest friends, along with other works including the Ethica and the Tractatus Politicus.Ludovico Geymonat, \\"Storia del Pensiero Scientifico e Filosofico\\" (History of Science and Philosophy). Garzanti, 1970. It is an attempt to formulate a philosophical method that would allow the mind to form the clear and distinct ideas that are necessary for its perfection. It contains, in addition, reflection upon the various kinds of knowledge, an extended treatment of definition, and a lengthy analysis of the nature and causes of doubt. He discusses, among other topics, perception, experience, intelligence, memory, and forgetting. Themes Spinoza commenced this treatise with the intention of examining the problem of knowledge, but the work was never completed. In his other works epistemological discussions are intimately linked with the rest of his philosophy. Indeed, even in the Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding epistemological views are almost inseparably connected with ethical ones. That is the consequence of his characteristic conception of knowledge. For Spinoza \\"knowledge\\" is \\"life\\", not in the sense that contemplation is the highest life, but in the sense that knowledge is the means of holding together the threads of life in a systematic unity that can fill its proper place in the cosmic system. There are two things which must be born in mind in connection with Spinoza's conception of knowledge. The first is his insistence on the active character of knowledge. The ideas or concepts by means of which thought constructs reality are not like \\"lifeless pictures on a panel\\"; they are activities by which reality is apprehended; they are part of reality, and reality is activity. The second point is that Spinoza does not divorce knowing from willing. Man always acts according to his lights. If a man's endeavours appear to fall short of his knowledge, that is only because his knowledge is not really what it is held to be, but is wanting in some respect. On the one hand, reason, for Spinoza, is essentially the \\"practical reason\\". On the other hand, the highest expression of willing is experienced in that striving for consistency and harmony which is so characteristic of reason.

Carmichael is the CEO and co-founder for Philadelphia-based La Colombe. He is the first American to complete a solo trek across Antarctica to the South Pole, on foot with no assistance, capturing the World Speed Record with a total travel time of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes. Recorded footage of his trek later became an award-winning documentary entitled Race to the Bottom of the Earth (2010) that was aired on the National Geographic Channel. With his World Record accomplishment, he also raised thousands for one of his numerous philanthropic projects. Carmichael was named Esquire Magazine's \\"American of the Year\\" and Philadelphia Magazine's \\"Person of the Year\\" in 2011 and later ranked #1 by Food Republic for the most influential figure in its Coffee Power Ranking. He is currently the host of Travel Channel's Dangerous Grounds and Uncommon Grounds. Early life and education Todd Carmichael was born on August 30, 1963 outside Spokane, Washington. He has three sisters. Carmichael completed his first marathon at age 15. His mother eventually moved the family to Spokane's South Hill so that he could attend Joel E. Ferris High School, which was home, at the time, to the region's best cross-country team. From 1981 to 1982, he was part of Ferris' state championship squad. He graduated from the high school in 1982, and received a distance running scholarship to the University of Washington, where he studied business and went on to work in accounting for Ernst & Young. He also ran his first ultramarathon at age 20. While at college in Seattle, Carmichael started working in the warehouse of Starbucks. Carmichael also met his longtime friend and future business partner, La Colombe co-founder Jean Philippe Iberti, in 1985.  Career La Colombe= In 1993, Todd Carmichael reconnected with Iberti, and returned to the U.S. in 1994, settling down in Philadelphia, PA in mid-January of that year. The two self-described coffee-geeks felt that the coffees they would get at restaurants to end their meals would often be disappointing, tarnishing their overall experience of what had been an enjoyable meal. So they set out to create what they would refer to as \\"culinary coffee,\\" and felt that the city was on the cusp of a culinary renaissance. Carmichael and Iberti opened La Colombe Torrefaction, their first European-style caf√© in May 1994 on 19th Street near Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square Park. In the beginning, they would roast their own unique blends in the back of their caf√©, and after struggling at first like most startup businesses, the demand for their coffee among restaurants began to increase exponentially. In December 1994, they opened a roastery in a warehouse in the city's Port Richmond neighborhood. Now, La Colombe is served in some of the most elite restaurants throughout the U.S. with top-rated caf√©s located in Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Seoul, South Korea and plans to open nearly 100 more establishments throughout the U.S. within the next five years. =Haiti Coffee Academy= In late 2009, Todd Carmichael began to formulate his idea to create a Southern blend that would later become known as La Colombe's Louisiane, which he felt needed to be made with coffee from Haiti. Once the wealthiest colony in the Western Hemisphere, producing 40 percent of the world's coffee, the Caribbean country had become, at the time, the poorest as a result of political upheaval, riots, wars, natural disasters, and embargoes that were sanctioned upon the nation. By 2011, there was not a single Haitian coffee bean found in the U.S. so Carmichael set out to find the coffee and bring it back. During his quest, he was accompanied by a camera crew, who were filming him for a series that would later become Travel Channel's Dangerous Grounds. While hunting for his elusive Haitian bean, he came upon a farm that inspired him to want to help Haiti improve its coffee farming methods. He was later approached by the Clinton Foundation to collaborate on a coffee project to aid in the revitalization of Haiti's ailing economy. In August 2012, the Foundation committed $350,000 to the project, and with the assistance of Conor Murphy, a business development advisor in Haiti, La Colombe worked out an agreement to lease for 10 years the farm that Carmichael initially came upon during his first episode of Dangerous Grounds, which is where the Haiti Coffee Academy currently resides. In August 2013, the academy officially registered as a private company in Haiti, and new Arabica seeds arrived from Brazil to be planted. In February 2014, President Bill Clinton, Todd Carmichael and J.P. Iberti visited the Haiti Coffee Academy for its official launch. =La Colombe Distilling= While on his numerous trips around the world sourcing coffee for La Colombe, Carmichael noticed everywhere that he went farmers would have a makeshift still, producing their own moonshine while also harvesting coffee. When La Colombe Torrefaction reached its nineteenth year of existence, Carmichael and Iberti started thinking about their twentieth anniversary and what new products they should launch. It was on a trip to Madagascar when a farmer handed Todd Carmichael some \\"sugar juice\\" that he said to himself: \\"I could make a better one, and we should have our own moonshine too.\\" At the time, Bickley and Iberti were frequently traveling in and out of Haiti. Noticing the vast amount of sugar cane growing in its field, they realized that exporting the plant could be another way La Colombe would be able to help the Haitian economy, so the \\"moonshine\\" project became focused on rum, which lead to the inception of La Colombe Distillery.  Travel  In 2000, Carmichael decided to take a three-month sabbatical from the coffee industry and his business, La Colombe Torrefaction. He arranged to be dropped off on Nagigia, a tiny island in the South Pacific with only about 150 inhabitants. \\"The idea was to go back in time‚Ä¶ to learn from the indigenous people there how to survive,\\" said Carmichael. He spent two and a half months surfing, spearing fish and building a hut. It became a turning point in his life. \\"During that time, I thought, 'You know what, it's very, very clear for you, my friend: Adventure and endurance is just part of your life. And it's time you take it more seriously.'\\" On December 21, 2008, Carmichael became the first American to cross from the shores of Antarctica to the South Pole on foot and unassisted. In doing so, he broke the World Speed Record with a total travel time of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes. He has also traveled across large parts of the Sahara on foot as well as the Gobi, Namib and others, and explored the Congolese jungle and Zimbabwe's scrub plains. In September 2010, he attempted to make the first solo self-contained trek across Death Valley, but was forced to abort the mission after a malfunction with his equipment. Philanthropy Todd Carmichael claims he has always been an advocate for social change. \\"It's not so much about being a philanthropist; it's simply about being a good neighbor,\\" proclaimed Carmichael. On his World Record- breaking adventure to the South Pole, he raised more than $250,000 for Orangutan Foundation International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of wild orangutans and their rainforest habitat. He has collaborated with actor Leonardo DiCaprio to create La Colombe's Lyon blend, with proceeds going to the funding of wildlife protection, forest preservation, clean-water projects, disaster relief and climate-change research around the globe via the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. Working with ECHOES Around the World in Uganda and Wide Horizons For Children in Ethiopia, he has actively engaged in bettering the lives of hundreds of orphaned children living in Africa through Project Afrique, a natural extension of his coffee work, made possible through the sales of La Colombe's Afrique blend and additional funding from the coffee-roasting company and his partner, J.P. Iberti. Carmichael is also assisting to bring safe drinking water into coffee- growing regions and throughout the world, in collaboration with the organizations Coffee For Water and charity: water. And of course, there is his work with the Clinton Foundation, whom he has partnered with to develop Haiti's first and only coffee academy, which is helping to revitalize the coffee industry in the impoverished country. Carmichael is also a supporter of the Rainforest Alliance, an organization dedicated to conserving biodiversity and ensuring sustainable livelihoods by transforming land-use practices, business practices and consumer behavior. Television and film During his journey across Antarctica, he maintained a video log of his progress, which was later formatted into a documentary, Race to the Bottom of the Earth (2010), which appeared on National Geographic. It was also picked as the winner of the \\"Best Documentary Feature\\" category at the Los Angeles Cinema Festival of Hollywood Winter 2011, and became an Official Selection at the Newport Beach Film Festival in 2011. He is currently the host of his own reality/adventure series on the Travel Channel entitled Dangerous Grounds, where he travels to the most remote and renowned coffee-producing regions of the world, sourcing for La Colombe. The television show premiered on November 5, 2012, and immediately received favorable ratings and reviews. Dangerous Grounds is on its third season of production, which premiered on February 26, 2015. Writing Carmichael was a prolific contributor to Esquire Magazine \\"Eat Like a Man\\" blog, where he covered subjects mainly related to coffee, its industry, and his travels in Haiti and the country's issues.http://www.esquire.com/archives/blogs/food-for- men/by_tag/the%20coffee%20man/15;1 He has also written for Huffington Post regarding topics about the environment and animal rights. Personal life Todd Carmichael is married to singer-songwriter Lauren Hart, the daughter of the Philadelphia Flyers and Lehigh Valley Phantoms announcer Gene Hart. They had met at an interview about his upcoming Antarctica exhibition, at the time, for NBC 10's The 10! Show, where she was the host. He called Hart during his adventure from the ice to ask her on their first date, and less than a month later, they were engaged. They have three daughters and one son, all of whom were adopted from Ethiopia. Carmichael shared, \\"Adoption isn't so much about doing something good for someone or charity - nothing like that. It's about building a family.\\" =Accolades and praise= Todd Carmichael has been awarded the honor of being named Esquire Magazine \\"American of the Year\\" and Philadelphia Magazine \\"Person of the Year\\" in 2011. He is currently the host of Travel Channel's Dangerous Grounds, where his globetrotting adventures in search of the finest coffees in the world are captured on video and brought into millions of living rooms around the world. In conjunction with The Clinton Foundation, Carmichael is one of the co-founders of the Haiti Coffee Academy, an institution created to help with the revitalization of the impoverished country's once prominent coffee industry. In 2014, he entered the Specialty Coffee Association of America and the Barista Guild of America's U.S. Brewers Cup competition for the first time, and surprised his many critics by winning the Northeast Regionals with a \\"full immersion - double suspended filtration\\" method. He also placed runner-up at the national competition in Seattle, WA, where he unveiled and used the prototype of his experimental brewing contraption, dubbed \\"The Dragon.\\" It is a manual coffee- brewing device that he invented, integrating the pour-over concept with elements of the classic siphon. That same year, Food Republic ranked him #1 in its \\"Coffee Power Ranking.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Todd Carmichael Home Page * La Colombe Home Page * * Todd Carmichael's Expedition Earth Blog * Race to the Bottom of the Earth * Todd Carmichael Interview After Reaching South Pole * Pacific Northwest Inlander Article by Jacob H.

As it occurred during World War II, information about the disaster was censored, and efforts at keeping the disaster secret hampered relief efforts and contributed to a high death toll. Earthquake The Mikawa earthquake's epicenter was offshore in Mikawa Bay at a depth of eleven kilometers. The city of Tsu recorded a magnitude of 6 on the Richter Scale; however, areas in southern Aichi prefecture were closer to the epicenter, and suffered significant damage. The earthquake created the Fukozu Fault, named after the village in the middle of the fault trace, in an area adjoining the west of the T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line railway between Okazaki and Gamag≈çri, Aichi Prefecture. The fault's total visible distance is little more than 9 km, but is of great interest to geologists as it has a right-angle bend in its middle part, rather than being straight or at a gentle curve. It is also remarkable in that ground displacement at the fault is up to one meter in places; however, the Tokaido Railway Line, although only 150 meters from the fault line in places, suffered no damage. Damage Hardest hit were what is now Hazu District: Nishio city, Kira town, Anj≈ç city, Hekinan city and Gamag≈çri city. The confirmed death toll was 1,180, with an additional 1,126 missing and 3,866 injured. As the earthquake occurred in the middle of the night, and towards the end of the war when fuel supplies were very low, only two houses were lost to fire, but 7,221 houses were totally destroyed, and 16,555 were severely damaged.
