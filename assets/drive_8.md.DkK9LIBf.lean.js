The immediate descendants of IJ are Haplogroup I and Haplogroup J. Its sole sibling is K (which includes most of the world's male population). Haplogroup IJ derived populations account for a significant proportion of the pre-modern populations of Europe (especially Scandinavia and the Balkans), Anatolia, the Middle East (especially Arabia, The Caucasus, Levant and Mesopotamia) and coastal North Africa. As a result of mass migrations during the modern era, they are now also significant in The Americas and Australasia. Origin A 2008 estimate suggested that the most recent common ancestor of haplogroup IJ could have lived 30,500‚Äì46,200 years ago, while another estimate suggests 43,000‚Äì45,700 years. Both of the primary branches of haplogroup IJ ‚Äì I-M170 and J-M304 ‚Äì are found among modern populations of the Caucasus, Anatolia, and Southwest Asia. This tends to suggest that Haplogroup IJ branched from IJK in West Asia and/or the Middle East. Examples of the basal/paragroup Haplogroup IJ* (M429) were first reported in a 2012 study of genetic diversity in Iran, by Grugni et al. These individuals were reported to be positive for M429 and negative for the SNPs M170 and M304, which define haplogroup I and haplogroup J respectively. However, because the researchers filtered for relatively few SNPs, these individuals may have carried less well-known SNPs equivalent to M170 and M304.Dienekes‚Äô Anthropology Blog: Huge study on Y-chromosome variation in Iran (Grugni et al. 2012)PLOS ONE: Ancient Migratory Events in the Middle East: New Clues from the Y-Chromosome Variation of Modern Iranians Given the limited scope of the testing ‚Äì and the small number of haplogroup IJ samples that were discovered ‚Äì few firm conclusions have yet been drawn. An inference may also be made that both IJ (M429) and its sole sibling, Haplogroup K (M9) diverged from the parent Haplogroup IJK closer to the Middle East than to East Asia, due to the evolutionary distance of IJK from its direct ancestor, haplogroup HIJK. IJ split in a typically disjunctive, almost mutually-exclusive geographical pattern, with J-M304 far more common in Arabia, and I-M170 far more common in Europe; the age of IJ and its subclades suggest that IJ probably entered Europe through the Balkans, some time before the last glacial maximum (about 26,500 years BP). The same geographic corridor (the Balkans) also supported later gene flows, including the Early Neolithic Farmers from Anatolia about 9,000 years BP.

Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in mental health law ruling that a state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by themselves or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. Since the trial court jury found, upon ample evidence, that petitioner did so confine respondent, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court's conclusion that petitioner had violated respondent's right to liberty. Overview Kenneth Donaldson (confined patient) had been held for 15 years in Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee, due to needs of \\"care, maintenance, and treatment.\\" He filed a lawsuit against the hospital and staff members claiming they had robbed him of his constitutional rights, by confining him against his will. Donaldson won his case (including monetary damages) in United States District Court, which was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.Donaldson v. O'Connor, 493 F.2d 507 (5th Cir. 1974). In 1975, the United States Supreme Court agreed that Donaldson had been improperly confined but vacated the award of damages. On remand, the Fifth Circuit ordered that a new trial on damages be held.Donaldson v. O'Connor, 519 F.2d 59 (5th Cir. 1975). A finding of \\"mental illness\\" alone cannot justify a State's locking a person up against his will and keeping him indefinitely in simple custodial confinement. Assuming that that term can be given a reasonably precise content and that the \\"mentally ill\\" can be identified with reasonable accuracy, there is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom. Kenneth Donaldson The origins of Donaldson's institutionalization began in 1943, at age 34, when he suffered a traumatic episode. He was hospitalized and received treatment, before resuming life with his family. In 1956 Donaldson traveled to Florida to visit his elderly parents. While there, Donaldson reported that he believed one of his neighbors in Philadelphia might be poisoning his food. His father, worried that his son suffered from paranoid delusions, petitioned the court for a sanity hearing. Donaldson was evaluated, diagnosed with \\"paranoid schizophrenia,\\" and civilly committed to the Florida State mental health system. At his commitment trial, Donaldson did not have legal counsel present to represent his case. Once he entered the Florida hospital, Donaldson was placed with dangerous criminals, even though he had never been proved to be dangerous to himself or others. His ward was understaffed, with only one doctor (who happened to be an obstetrician) for over 1,000 male patients. There were no psychiatrists or counsellors, and the only nurse on site worked in the infirmary. He spent 15 years as a patient; he did not receive any treatment, actively refusing it, and attempting to secure his release. Throughout his stay he denied he was ever mentally ill, and refused to be put into a halfway house. Donaldson later wrote a book about his experience as a mental patient titled Insanity Inside Out.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. It is the first of three sonnets describing a separation between the speaker and the beloved. Paraphrase My separation from you has seemed like winter, since you give pleasure to the year. Winter has seemed to be everywhere, even though in reality our separation occurred during summer and fall, when the earth produces plant life like a widow giving birth after the death of her husband. Yet I saw these fruits of nature as hopeless orphans, since it could not be summer unless you were here; since you were away, even the birds did not sing, or rather sang so plaintively that they made the very leaves look pale, thinking of winter. Structure Sonnet 97 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 6th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / The teeming autumn, big with rich increase, / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, (97.6-7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. It is followed (in line 7) by an initial reversal, a fairly common metrical variation which also potentially occurs in lines 1, 9, and 13. A mid-line inversion occurs in line 8 and, more plainly, line 14: √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. (97.14) Sources and analysis Following Edmond Malone, T. W. Baldwin notes a resemblance between this poem's trope for the seasons and the \\"childing autumn\\" of A Midsummer Night's Dream 2.1.112; he traces the figure to Ovid. Dowden says that 97 seems to begin a new group of sonnets, comprising 97, 98, and 99. Edward Hubler remarks on the \\"passages of unobtrusive melody and easy grace.\\" Thematically, the poem belongs among those poems treating absence or separation. Hilton Landry groups the sonnet with others, such as 54 and 55, in which the speaker is forced to call to mind an inferior mental substitute for his absent beloved. Notes References * Baldwin, T. W.

Licensed to Abbeville, Louisiana, United States, the station serves the Lafayette area. The station is currently owned by Townsquare Media. Its studios are located on Bertrand Road in Lafayette, and its transmitter is located north of Abbeville. History KROF made its official debut on July 9, 1948. It broadcast as a daytime-only station on 960 with 1,000 watts and was the first radio station in Abbeville. The station was owned by Abbeville Broadcasting Service, a local corporation in which residents of Vermilion Parish invested $50,000. The station affiliated with the short-lived Progressive Broadcasting System in 1950. In October 1970, interests from Crowley began a bid to take over KROF. William C. Broadhurst, an attorney, sent letters to the shareholders in Abbeville Broadcasting Service, offering $400 per share. However, Broadhurst was only able to acquire 176 of the 187 shares necessary to gather a controlling interest in the licensee. Local groups, including the Abbeville city council, passed resolutions asking the Federal Communications Commission to disapprove of any sale of KROF to out-of-town parties, fearful that with the recent sale of the Abbeville Meridional newspaper to other Crowley-based investors, there would be no locally owned source of news and information in Vermilion Parish. Abbeville Broadcasting Service filed to build an FM counterpart for KROF in 1973. KROF-FM debuted May 25, 1974, allowing Abbeville Broadcasting Service to broadcast after dark; during the day, it simulcast its AM counterpart. The AM and FM sides began to air more separate programming as the 1970s went on, with 960 AM continuing in its Top 40 format while 104.9 FM became a country outlet, changing its call letters on November 1, 1980 to KASC, for \\"Acadiana/Stereo Country\\". In 1984, KROF became known as \\"Boss 96\\". Two years later, however, 104.9 became KROF-FM and the two stations resumed a simulcast of what had been the FM's country format. When KROF-FM moved to 105.1 MHz in 1991 as part of a power increase, the two stations flipped to oldies. The AM and FM frequencies split again in 1993, but this time, it was the AM's turn to make the change. On March 1, KROF AM began broadcasting entirely in French, including Cajun music and commercials. It was the only all-French station in Louisiana. The effort ended after seven months on September 30, when the station resumed simulcasting the FM due to lack of support for the French-language format. In January 1994, KROF AM rolled out a new \\"Cajun Country Gold\\" format. Local Vermilion Parish sports broadcasts remained on AM until they moved to the FM frequency in 1996. Larger changes came in 1999 when a majority stake in KROF-AM-FM was sold to Galloway Consulting Services, owners of multiple stations in the Lafayette market, for $787,500. Galloway, which became known as ComCorp of Lafayette, sold the entire cluster to Regent Communications‚Äîpredecessor to Townsquare Media‚Äîin 2001 for $39.6 million, marking its exit from radio while continuing to own television stations.

The E Ingraham Clock Company, the Ansonia Clock Company, the New Haven Clock Company, the Seth Thomas Clock Company, Sessions and its predecessor E.N. Welch Company, the William L. Gilbert Clock Company, and the Waterbury Clock Company collectively produced most of the mechanical clocks made in America between the mid-19th century and 1950. At about 1935, Sessions ended its production of mechanical clocks and produced electrical clocks exclusively.  History  In 1902, William E Sessions and other family members purchased a controlling interest in the E.N. Welch Company, a clock manufacturer located in Forestville, Connecticut. Sessions' father owned a foundry located in Bristol, Connecticut that produced cases for E.N Welch Co. On January 9, 1903, the company was reorganized as The Sessions Clock Company. Within a few years the Sessions Clock Company was producing clock movements, cases, dials, artwork and castings for their line of mechanical clocks. Between 1903 and 1933 Sessions produced 52 models of mechanical clocks, ranging from Advertisers, large and small clocks with logos of various businesses, to wall, or regulator clocks, and shelf or mantel clocks, designed for the home. Many of the Session clocks from this period are prized by collectors. In 1930, the company expanded to produce electric clocks and timers for radios, while continuing to produce traditional brass mechanical movements. Beginning at the end of World War II Sessions W Model (electric) was widely used by various casting companies for their clocks. The dial of the W Model read Movement by Sessions. In the early 1950s Sessions begin to produce timers for television. In 1956, Sessions was absorbed by a company interested mainly in their timing devices. In 1959, William K. Sessions, grandson of William E. Sessions left the Sessions Clock Company and formed the New England Clock Company. In 1960, one of the Sessions Clock buildings was sold to the Bristol Instrument Gears Company. Kept as the Sessions Company, the new owners ran the operation until 1969 when changes in the market forced the Sessions Company into liquidation. In 1970, the remaining buildings were sold to Dabko Industries, a machine parts manufacturer.

It is defined by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations, or UEPs, M1(YAP), M145(P205), M203, P144, P153, P165, P167, P183.ISOGG reference webpage. DE is unique because it is distributed in several geographically distinct clusters. An immediate subclade, haplogroup D (also known as D-CTS3946), is mainly found in Eastern Asia, parts of Central Asia, and the Andaman Islands, but also sporadically in West Africa and West Asia. The other immediate subclade, haplogroup E, is common in Africa, and to a lesser extent the Middle East and Europe. The most well-known unique event polymorphism (UEP) that defines DE is the Y-chromosome Alu Polymorphism \\"YAP\\". The mutation was caused when a strand of DNA, known as Alu, inserted a copy of itself into the Y chromosome. Hence, all Y chromosomes belonging to DE, D, E and their subclades are YAP-positive (YAP+). All Y chromosomes that belong to other haplogroups and subclades are YAP-negative (YAP-). The age of haplogroup DE, previously estimated at between 65,000 and 71,000 years, was later estimated at around 73,000 years and most recently at around 76,000 years old. Distribution The subclades of DE continue to confound investigators trying to reconstruct the migration of humans because, while they are common in Africa and East Asia, they are also largely absent between these two regions. As the paragroup DE(xD,E), including DE*, is extremely rare, the majority of DE male lines fall into subclades of either D-CTS3946 or E-M96. D-CTS3946 is suggested to have originated in Africa, though its most widespread subclade, D-M174, likely originated in Asia ‚Äì the only place where D-M174 is now found. E-M96 is more likely to have originated in East Africa. However, a West Asian origin for E-M96 is considered possible by some scholars. All subclades of DE, including D and E, appear to be exceptionally rare ‚Äì almost non-existent ‚Äì in mainland South Asia and South East Asia. Given that D-M174 is dominant in Japan, the Andaman Islands, and Tibet, whereas E-M96 is relatively common in Africa and the Middle East, some researchers have suggested that the rarity of DE lineages in India ‚Äì a region considered important in the dispersal of modern humans ‚Äì may be meaningful. By comparison, subclades of CF ‚Äì the only \\"sibling\\" haplogroup of DE ‚Äì are found in India at significant proportions. DE* Basal DE* is extremely unusual in that it is found, at very low frequencies, among males from three widely separated regions: West Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. A 2003 study by Weale et al., of the DNA of over 8,000 males worldwide, found that five out of 1,247 Nigerian males belonged to DE*. The DE* found possessed by these five Nigerians, according to the study's authors, was \\"the least derived of all YAP chromosomes according to currently known binary markers\\" ‚Äì to such an extent that it suggested that DE had originated in West Africa and expanded from there. However, Weale et al., cautioned that such inferences may well be incorrect. In addition, the seemingly \\"paraphyletic\\" (basal) status of the Nigerian examples of DE-YAP may be \\"illusory\\" because the \\"branching order, and hence the origin, of YAP-derived haplogroups remains uncertain\\". It was \\"easy to misinterpret apparently paraphyletic groups\\", and subsequent research might show that the Nigerian examples of DE were as divergent from DE*, D* and E*. \\"[T]he only genealogically meaningful definition of the age of a clade is the time to its most recent common ancestor, but only if DE* is [truly] paraphyletic does it ... become automatically older than D or E...\\" The relationship between DE*, according to Weale et al., \\"can be viewed as a missing-data problem...\\" In 2007, another West African example of DE* was reported ‚Äì carried by a speaker of the Nalu language who was among 17 Y-DNA samples taken in Guinea Bissau. The sequence of this individual differed by one mutation from those of the Nigerian individuals, indicating common ancestry, although the relationship between the two lineages has not been determined. In 2008, a basal paternal marker belonging to DE* was identified in two individuals from Tibet (two out of 594), belonging to the Tibeto-Burman group. A 2010 study found six additional samples of DE in southeastern Nigeria in individuals of the Ibibio, Igbo, and Oron ethnic groups. In 2012, haplogroup DE* was found in one Caribbean sample. A 2019 study by Haber et al. suggested that three of the Nigerians analysed by Weale et al. in 2003 belonged, not to DE*, but to D0, a proposed haplogroup thought to represent a deep-rooting DE lineage branching close to the DE bifurcation (near the split of D and E) but on the D branch as an outgroup to all other known D chromosomes. Another carrier of D0 (the D-FT75 branch) is famous skaterhttps://tass.ru/moskva/7434455 Ruslan bin Makin Al-Bitar from Syria.https://www.familytreedna.com/public/sidoroff/default.aspx?section=yresults Recently two other D0 samples were found in Saudi Arabia. In the Recent ISOGG tree, D0 was renamed D2, and D-M174 was renamed D1. Origins Most parsimonious phylogeny of YAP according to Underhill and Kivisild 2007 =Discovery= The YAP insertion was discovered by scientists led by Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona. Between 1997 and 1998 Hammer published three articles relating to the origins of haplogroup DE. These articles state that YAP insertion originated in Asia. As recently as 2007, some studies such as Chandrasekar et al. 2007, cite the publications by Hammer when arguing for an Asian origin of the YAP insertion. The scenarios outlined by Hammer include an out of Africa migration over 100,000 years ago, the YAP+ insertion on an Asian Y-chromosome 55,000 years ago and a back migration of YAP+ from Asia to Africa 31,000 years ago by its subclade haplogroup E. This analysis was based on the fact that older African lineages, such as haplogroups A and B, were YAP negative whereas the younger lineage, haplogroup E was YAP positive. Haplogroup D, which is YAP positive, was clearly an Asian lineage, being found only in East Asia with high frequencies in the Andaman Islands, Japan and Tibet. Because the mutations that define haplogroup E were observed to be in the ancestral state in haplogroup D, and haplogroup D at 55kya, was considerably older than haplogroup E at 31kya, Hammer concluded that haplogroup E was a subclade of haplogroup D and migrated back to Africa. A 2000 study concerning the origin of the YAP+ mutation analyzed 841 Y-chromosomes representing 36 human populations of wide geographical distribution for the presence of a Y-specific Alu insert (YAP+ chromosomes). They also analyzed the Out-of-Africa and out-of-Asia models for the YAP mutations. According to the authors, the most ancient YAP+ mutation was found in the Asian lineage of Tibetans, but curiously not in Japanese lineages. More recent YAP+ lineages were distributed almost equally in Asians and Africans, with a smaller distribution in Europe. The scientists concluded that the information available did not allow one to decide between the out-of-Asia or out-of-Africa models. They further suggested that the YAP+ mutation had already originated 141,000 years ago.Origin of YAP+ lineages of the human Y‚Äêchromosome - M. Bravi et al. =Contemporary studies= Since 2000, a number of scientists began to reassess the hypothesis of an Asian origin of the YAP insertion and to suggest an African origin. Underhill et al. 2001 identified the D-M174 mutation that defines haplogroup D. The M174 allele is found in the ancestral state in all African lineages including haplogroup E. The discovery of M174 mutation meant that haplogroup E could not be a subclade of haplogroup D. These findings effectively neutralized the argument of an Asian origin of the YAP+ based on the character state of the M40 and M96 mutations that define haplogroup E. According to Underhill et al. 2001, the M174 data alone would support an African origin of the YAP insertion. In Altheide and Hammer 1997, the authors argue that haplogroup E arose in Asia on an ancestral YAP+ allele before migrating back to Africa. However some studies, such as Semino et al., indicate that the highest frequency and diversity of haplogroup E is in Africa, and East Africa is the most likely place of origin of the haplogroup. The models supporting an African origin or an Asian origin of the YAP+ insertion both required the extinction of the ancestral YAP chromosome to explain the current distribution of the YAP+ polymorphism. Paragroup DE* possesses neither the mutations that define haplogroup D or haplogroup E. If paragroup DE* was found in one location but not the other, it would boost one theory over the other. Haplogroup DE* has been found in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau and also in Tibet. The phylogenetic relationship of three DE* sequences has yet to be determined, but it is known that the Guinea Bissau sequences differ from the Nigerian sequences by at least one mutation. Weale et al. state that the discovery of DE* among Nigerians pushes back the date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of African YAP chromosomes. This, in his view, has the effect of reducing the time window through which a possible back migration from Asia to Africa could occur. Chandrasekhar et al. 2007,YAP insertion signature in South Asia - Chandrasekar 2007 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6053145_YAP_insertion_signature_in_South_Asia) have argued for an Asian origin of the YAP+. They state: \\"The presence of the YAP insertion in Northeast Indian tribes and Andaman Islanders with haplogroup D suggests that some of the M168 chromosomes gave rise to the YAP insertion and M174 mutation in South Asia.\\" They also argue that YAP+ migrated back to Africa with other Eurasian haplogroups, such as Haplogroup R1b1* (18-23kya), which has been observed with especially high frequency among the members of some peoples in northern Cameroon, and Haplogroup T (39-45 kya), which has been observed in low frequencies in Africa. Haplogroup E at 50kya is considerably older than these haplogroups and has been observed at frequencies of 80-92% in Africa. In a 2007 study, Peter Underhill and Toomas Kivisild stated that there will always be uncertainty regarding the precise origins of DNA sequence variants such as YAP because of a lack of knowledge concerning prehistoric demographics and population movements. However Underhill and Kivisild contend that with all the available information, the African origin of the YAP+ polymorphism is more parsimonious and more plausible than the Asian origin hypothesis. In a press release concerning a study by Karafet et al. 2008, Michael Hammer revised the dates for the origin Haplogroup DE from 55,000 years ago to 65,000 years ago. For haplogroup E, Hammer revised the dates from 31,000 years ago to 50,000 years ago. Hammer is also quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe age of haplogroup DE is about 65,000 years, just a bit younger than the other major lineage to leave Africa, which is assumed to be about 70,000 years old‚Äù, in which he implies that haplogroup DE left Africa soon after haplogroup CT.Scientists reshape Y chromosome haplogroup tree gaining new insights into human ancestry A 2018 study, based on analyzing maternal and paternal markers, their current distribution, and inferences from the DNA of the Altai Neanderthals, supports an Asian origin of paternal haplogroup DE and maternal haplogroup L3. The study suggests a back migration into Africa and a following admixture of the native Africans with immigrating peoples from Asia. It is suggested that DE originated about 70,000 years ago somewhere near Tibet and Central Asia. Additionally, the authors argue that the presence of DE* in Tibet, and that Tibet shows the greatest diversity concerning haplogroup D, supports the origin of DE* in this region. It is further argued that haplogroup E is of Asian origin and that the haploid diversity of haplogroup E supports a strong Eurasian male gene flow. The authors conclude that this supports an Asian origin and may also explain signals of small percentages of Neanderthal DNA found in northern and some western Africans. A 2019 study by Haber et al. supports an African origin for haplogroup DE*, based in part on the discovery of haplogroup D0 found in three Nigerians (according to the authors a branch of the DE lineage near the DE split but on the D branch), as well as on an analysis of y-chromosomal phylogeny, recently calculated haplogroup divergence dates and evidence for ancestral Eurasians outside Africa. The authors consider other possible scenarios, but conclude in favor of a model involving an African origin of hapologroup DE, with haplogroups E and D0 also originating in Africa, along with the migration out of Africa of the three lineages (C, D and FT) that now form the vast majority of non- African Y chromosomes. The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups. FTDNA, in 2019, found three other D0 samples: one in Syria (the most basal sample of D0 found to date, diverging about 26,000 years ago), and two in Saudi Arabia. According to Runfeldt and Sager of FTDNA (as also found by Haber et al.), D0 is a very divergent offshoot on the D branch, diverging around 71,000 years ago, and lacking the M174 mutation that defines other D chromosomes. According to their schematics D0 can be grouped into an Asian cluster (West Asia) and African cluster (Nigeria). Two D0 branches were confirmed: D-FT75 found in West Asia and D-FT76 found in West Asia and West Africa. \\"D0\\" has also been alternately named \\"D2\\", and former D (D-M174) has now been termed \\"D1\\", since the discovery of D0. The research team says they will continue to analyze additional samples. Both theories (Out-of-Africa and Out-of-Asia) regarding the origin of haplogroup DE are discussed and more studies are needed to conclude about a proposed origin.

Guri Schanke said, in a webchat with the Norwegian newspaper VG before this was known, that the song was specially written for her, and that it was written on a request from NRK to Thomas G:son. Schanke's manager, Viggo Lund, said he was surprised to hear about the album release. Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) has the rights for the songs that are part of Melodi Grand Prix, and the first right to use them. The EBU and NRK started investigations on the case.

Although canceled after two seasons, Los Beltr√°n received a number of media awards. Los Beltr√°n was the first sitcom in two decades to deal with the Cuban American experience (following the PBS bilingual sitcom ¬øQu√© Pasa, USA?, which aired from 1977 to 1980) and the first-ever Spanish-language entertainment series to feature sympathetic gay characters as regulars. Plot and characters The series was based broadly on the 1970s U.S. sitcom All in the Family, by Norman Lear, and on its 1960s British antecedent, Till Death Us Do Part. The lead character, Manny Beltr√°n (Emiliano D√≠ez), was an ultraconservative Cuban exile who owned a small bodega (neighborhood market) in southern California. Manny was comically obsessed with money, and with reason: he was financially supporting not only his wife Letti (Margarita Coego) and law-student daughter Anita (played by Yeni √Ålvarez), but also his daughter's militantly liberal husband, Miguel Perez (Demetrius Navarro), a Chicano art student who was constantly challenging his father-in-law's prejudices and politics, while living under Manny's roof and eating his food. Unlike the families of Archie Bunker and Alf Garnett, however, the Beltr√°ns in the first episode are moving up from their working-class digs to a nice, middle-class duplex in Burbank, which they've bought thanks to some lottery winnings. Upon moving in, they discover that their next-door neighbors (and holdover tenants) are a homosexual couple: a Spanish physician, Fernandito Salazar (Gabriel Romero), and his American boyfriend, Kevin Lynch (James C. Leary). This sets up a number of plot lines through the course of the series, much as did the Jeffersons moving in next door to the Bunkers in the early days of All in the Family. Two particular episodes, focused on Fernandito and Kevin, got the series noticed by some English-language media. In the first season, Fernandito gets an unexpected visit from his father, a Spanish general (who resembles the late caudillo Francisco Franco), and in the end comes out to the father as gay. In the second season, Fernandito and Kevin have a commitment ceremony‚Äîshortly after Californians in real life had voted on, and passed into law, the anti-gay-marriage Proposition 22. This was the first same-sex wedding ceremony ever shown on a Spanish-language television series. Awards and recognition Los Beltr√°n received the 2001 Imagen Foundation Award for Best Comedy Series and the 2001 ALMA Award from the National Council of La Raza for Best Spanish Language Comedy Series. It was nominated for two GLAAD Media Awards, the first Spanish-language program so honored by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Toxic granulation refers to dark coarse granules found in granulocytes, particularly neutrophils, in patients with inflammatory conditions. Clinical significance Along with D√∂hle bodies and toxic vacuolation, which are two other findings in the cytoplasm of granulocytes, toxic granulation is a peripheral blood film finding suggestive of an inflammatory process. Toxic granulation is often found in patients with bacterial infection and sepsis, although the finding is nonspecific. Patients being treated with chemotherapy or granulocyte colony stimulating factor, a cytokine drug, may also exhibit toxic granulation. Composition Toxic granules are mainly composed of peroxidase and acid hydrolase enzymes, and are similar in composition to the primary granules found in immature granulocytic cells like promyelocytes. Although normal, mature neutrophils do contain some primary granules, the granules are difficult to identify by light microscopy because they lose their dark blue colour as the cells mature. Toxic granulation thus represents abnormal maturation of neutrophils.

The issue before the US Supreme Court involved how the states could determine how to implement a federal program. The court used the term \\"co-operative federalism.\\" Background Mrs. Sylvester Smith was a Dallas County, Alabama resident who had four children, without a biological father providing support. The father of three of her children had died and the father of her fourth child was not in the picture. Thus, she qualified for AFDC. She was, however, having an affair with a Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams had nine children of his own. Williams, who visited on weekends, was counted as a \\"substitute father\\", thus disqualifying the family for aid according to Alabama Law.

It was planned to be formed by the amalgamation of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. History The Wessex Brigade had previously rejected the formation of a large regiment in the 1960s, although the territorial Wessex Regiment (Volunteers) had existed from 1967 to 1995. When the Brigade structure was ended in the late 60s, the Wessex Brigade reverted to single battalion regiments, becoming part of the Prince of Wales' Division. However, in 2004, it was announced that all remaining single battalion regiments would be amalgamated into large regiments. The interim plan proposed by the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) for the Prince of Wales' Division was to create three Regiments, each with two regular and one territorial battalion: *The Royal Welch Fusiliers and Royal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot) would be amalgamated into a two battalion Welsh regiment *The 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot) and the Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's) would be amalgamated into a two battalion regiment *The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment would be amalgamated into a two battalion regiment. On 16 December 2004, the Secretary of State for Defence announced that, as part of the final restructuring, the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment would be deamalgamated into its constituent parts, with the former Gloucestershire Regiment element merging with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment to become the new 1st Battalion, The Light Infantry, and the former Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire) amalgamating with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires). Approximately six months later, this decision was reversed, with the RGBW then to be amalgamated wholesale with the D&D; as a single battalion of the new large regiment that eventually became The Rifles.

Biography Calvert was born January 2, 1803 in Prince George County, Maryland. His mother, Rosalie Eugenia Stier (1778‚Äì1821), was the daughter of a wealthy Belgian aristocrat, Baron Henri Joseph Stier (1743‚Äì1821) and his wife Marie Louise Peeters. His father, George Calvert (1768‚Äì1838), was the son of Benedict Swingate Calvert ‚Äì a natural son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore ‚Äì and his wife Elizabeth Calvert (1731‚Äì1788). George Calvert was the Calverts' eldest son. He grew up in Maryland, graduated from Harvard College in 1823, and studied in Germany where in March 1825 he met the poet Goethe. Returning to Baltimore, he edited the Baltimore American. In 1840 he made another trip to Europe, meeting William Wordsworth. In 1843, Calvert moved to Newport, Rhode Island. Marriage On May 11, 1829, George Calvert married Elizabeth Steuart (1802‚Äì1897). His father was opposed to the match on the grounds that Elizabeth, the daughter of Baltimore physician James Steuart, had little property to her name. However a compromise was eventually reached and, after a suitable delay, the couple were married at the Steuart house in West Baltimore, Maryland Square. George and Elizabeth had no children.Challcott, p.375 Academia and politics In 1830, Calvert was appointed the Chair of Moral Philosophy at the newly established College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Baltimore.

Analogously to the US federal government, it is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The head of the executive is the Governor. The Legislature consists of the Senate and the Assembly. The Unified Court System consists of the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The state is also divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government. Executive The elected executive officers are: There are several (limited to twentyConstitution of the State of New York Article V, ¬ß 2.) state government departments: * Department of Agriculture and Markets * Department of Audit and Control * Department of Civil Service * Department of Corrections and Community Supervision State Education Building in Albany * Department of Economic Development * Education Department * Department of Environmental Conservation * Executive Department * Department of Family Assistance * Department of Financial Services * Department of Health * Department of Labor * Department of Law * Department of Mental Hygiene * Department of Motor Vehicles * Department of Public Service * Department of State * Department of Taxation and Finance * Department of Transportation Regulations are promulgated and published in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR). There are also numerous decisions, opinions, and rulings of state agencies. Legislature New York's Legislative set up is no different than that of the remaining 50 states of the country. The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Assembly consists of 150 members; the Senate varies in its number of members, but currently has 63. The Assembly is headed by the Speaker; the Senate is headed by the President, a post held ex officio by the Lieutenant Governor, who only has a tie-breaking \\"casting vote\\", but more often it is presided over by the Temporary President or by a senator of the Majority Leader's choosing. The east face of the New York State Capitol in Albany The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two- thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House. Furthermore, it has the power to propose amendments to the New York Constitution by a majority vote and then another majority vote following an election. If so proposed, the amendment becomes valid if agreed to by the voters at a referendum. The session laws are published in the official Laws of New York. The permanent laws of a general nature are codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York. = Committees = The New York State Senate has 32 standing committees, this ranks them second place to Mississippi which has 35. The Assembly on the other hand has 37 standing committees which compared to other houses of the nation is the 5th largest. Committees have legislative jurisdiction for the communities or agencies they represent. Committees are responsible for reviewing bills before deciding to report them to the voting floor.

According to the New York State Legislative Calendar, session convenes January 9th throughout June 19th. Budget deadline is the last week of March, but historically it has dragged on 'til the month of August and can even surpass that if the Senate and the Assembly fails to compromise. During session both houses work both together and independently to introduce bills and propose changes or support for the Governor's executive budget. During the legislative session for both houses (Senate and Assembly): # Bills are Introduced and voted on to become law or not # Resolutions/Proclamations are adopted # Changes to the Governors Executive Budget are proclaimed Judiciary The New York State Unified Court System interprets and applies the law of New York, ensures equal justice under law, and provides a mechanism for dispute resolution. The court system in New York tends to produce mild confusion for outsiders. In general, the judicial system is composed of the trial courts, consisting of the superior courts and the local courts, and the appellate courts. The appellate courts are the: * Court of Appeals * Appellate Division of the Supreme Court The New York County Courthouse in Manhattan * appellate terms of the Supreme Court * appellate sessions of the County Court The superior courts are the: * Supreme Court * County Court * specialized courts (Family Court, Surrogate's Court, Court of Claims) And the inferior courts are the local courts: * District Court * New York City courts (NYC Criminal Court, NYC Civil Court) * city courts * justice courts (town and village courts) The highest court of appeal is the Court of Appeals (instead of the \\"Supreme Court\\") whereas the primary felony trial court is the County Court (or the Supreme Court in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The New York City courts make up the largest local court system. The system is administered by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, also known as the Chief Judge of New York, the Chief Administrative Judge, the Office of Court Administration and other agencies. Local government An event outside New York City Hall in Manhattan The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all municipal corporations with their own government that provide most local government services. Whether a municipality is defined as a city, town, or village is not dependent on population or land area, but rather by the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature. Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution, and a local law has a status equivalent with a law enacted by the Legislature (subject to certain exceptions and restrictions). New York also has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts as well as New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations. New York has 62 counties, which are subdivided into 932 towns and 62 cities; it also has 10 Indian reservations. In total, the state has over 3400 active local governments and over 4200 taxing jurisdictions. In 1898, when New York City was consolidated into its present form, all previous town and county governments within it were abolished in favor of the present five boroughs and unified, centralized city government (the New York City government). Other governments =Tribal government= Native Americans' governments are significantly independent of the state and its local governments. New York cannot interfere with tribal self-government, but may regulate conduct on tribal territory concerning non-Native Americans. For example, federal law forbids states and local authorities to tax Indian lands; however, the state can and does tax sales of cigarettes to non-tribe members on tribal territory.

Ancient theater of Aptera Aptera (Steph. B., s.v. ·ºåœÄœÑŒµœÅŒ± or Ptol. iii. 17. ¬ß. 10.) also called ApteronPlin. iv. 20. was an ancient city, now an archaeological site in western Crete, a kilometre inland from the southern shore of Souda Bay, about 13 km east of Chania in the municipality of Akrotiri. History It is mentioned (A-pa-ta-wa) in Linear B tablets from the 14th-13th centuries BC. With its highly fortunate geographical situation, the city-state was powerful from Minoan through Hellenistic times, when it gradually declined. However, the Minoan settlement of the Bronze Age was located about 1.5 km away from Aptera, at the place of the modern Stylos settlement.https://www.academia.edu/42548172/The_Minoan_Settlement_of_the_Northern_Part_of_the_District_of_Apokoronas_and_Minoan_Apatawa In Greek mythology, Aptera was the site of the legendary contest between the Sirens and the Muses, when after the victory of the Muses, the Sirens lost the feathers of their wings from their shoulders, and having thus become white, cast themselves into the sea. The name of the city literally means \\"without wings\\", and the neighbouring islands Leucae means \\"white\\".Steph. B. s. v. Aptera In the third century BC, Aptera was at war with Kydonia,Hogan, 2008 a prominent ancient city on northwestern Crete. In much of the Greek Archaic Period, Aptera was under the control of Kydonia. During the Lyttian War in 220 BC, Aptera was at one time in alliance with Cnossus, but was afterwards compelled by the Polyrrhenians to side with them against that city.Pol. iv. 55. The port of Aptera according to Strabo was Cisamus. It was destroyed by earthquake during the 7th century. By the 12th century, a monastery of St. John Theologos had been built on the site; it continued in operation until 1964. The site is now maintained by the Greek Ministry of Culture, Department of Antiquities.Most information in this paragraph is taken from the Ministry of Culture's informational sign at the site. The hilltop, about 150 metres above the sea, commands views of Souda Bay and the Akrotiri Peninsula to the north, the Lefka Ori (White Mountains) to the south, and Kalives and the Turkish Izzedin Castle to the east; the city of Chania is not quite visible to the west. There are several structures within the square monastery enclosure,Taylor, 1863 including a chapel and a two-story block of monks' cells. The surrounding site is notable for a two-part temple from the 5th century BC, a large three-vaulted Roman cistern, Roman baths, and parts of several Doric temples. An ancient theater and a Roman peristyle villa have also been discovered on the site.

He served as the acting FIFA president until 26 February 2016 as the previous president, Sepp Blatter, was banned from all football-related activities in 2015 as a part of the FIFA corruption investigation of 2015. He was the president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) between 1988 and 2017. In 2002, he ran for president of FIFA but was defeated by Blatter. He is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In November 2010 he was alleged by the BBC to have taken bribes in the 1990s regarding the awarding of World Cup television rights. The IOC has announced it will investigate him.Owen Gibson (30 November 2010) \\"England's 2018 hopes rise as Vladimir Putin hints he will not turn up\\", The Guardian Following the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Hayatou took charge of FIFA, as the acting president, until 26 February 2016 when Gianni Infantino was elected to the position. On 16 March 2017, he was defeated by Malagasy challenger Ahmad Ahmad, ending Hayatou's 29-year reign as the CAF President. On 24 May 2017, he was appointed President of the National Football Academy by the president of Cameroon, Paul Biya. Life and career Hayatou is the fifth president of the Confederation of African Football. He was born in Garoua, Cameroon, the son of a local Sultan, and became a middle distance runner and physical education teacher. Hayatou had a successful career as an athlete, becoming a member of the Cameroonian national squads in both Basketball and Athletics, and holding national record times in the 400 and 800-meter running.Issa Hayatou: Les 50 personnalit√©s qui font le Cameroun.

Tiego Tiemtore. PANA Press. 2006. He lost his seventh re-election campaign to Ahmad Ahmad in March 2017. =Growth of the CAF= President of CAF for over two decades, Hayatou has overseen particularly successful FIFA World Cup appearances by Senegal, Nigeria, and Cameroon, and pushed for African places in the finals to increase from two to five, with the 2010 World Cup in South Africa seeing the hosts garner an automatic sixth spot for an African team. Mr. Hayatou has presided over both the bid and the organising committee for the 2010 games, the first in Africa. The African Cup of Nations finals expanded from 8 to 16 teams, in a confederation of over 50 nations in six zones and five regional confederations. Club competitions have undergone a similar growth in both numbers and scale, with more clubs participating in the African Cup of Champions Clubs, the CAF Confederation Cup (begun in 2004 for national cup winners and high-placed league teams), the CAF Cup, and the CAF Super Cup. There has also been an expansion outside men's football, with the CAF overseeing Youth, Women's, Fustal, and Beach soccer competitions.Issa Hayatou : Mes 20 ans √† la Caf . Missi Bikoun, Mutations (Youande), 10 March 2008. =Relations with UEFA and FIFA= One of the major aims of Hayatou's presidency in the late 1990s was to provide incentives to African football clubs which would stem the flow of African players to Europe; an initiative which met with little success.Paul Darby, Gerard Akindes, Matthew Kirwin Football Academies and the Migration of African Football Labor to Europe. Journal of Sport & Social Issues, Vol. 31, No. 2, 143‚Äì161 (2007) Hayatou has couched some criticism of the uneven flow of football 'resources' in colonial terms, saying that \\"rich countries import the raw material ‚Äì talent ‚Äì and often send their less valuable technicians\\", an implied criticism of foreign coaching staffs that employed by most African national sides.A Desai, G Vahed.World Cup 2010: Africa's turn or the turn on Africa? Soccer & Society, Volume 11, Issue 1, January 2010 , pages 154 ‚Äì 167. A September 1997 initiative negotiated by Hayatou with UEFA saw the payment of fees to African governing bodies and clubs for African-born players working in Europe. This was followed by the Meridian Project signed in December 1997 with UEFA, which was to provide cash payments to African National Associations every other year, and created the UEFA‚ÄìCAF Meridian Cup. The 1999 Goal Project created with FIFA gives 46 African FAs financial support worth one million dollars over four years. These negotiations, regardless of their impact on African club football, forged a close relationship between UEFA leaders and Hayatou, and led to UEFA's backing of Hayatou's nomination to replace Sepp Blatter as head of FIFA in 2002.John Sugdun, Alan Tominson, Paul Darby (1998). \\"FIFA versus UEFA in the struggle for the control of world football\\". pp. 11‚Äì31 in Adam Brown (ed) Fanatics!: power, identity, and fandom in football. Taylor & Francis, pp. 22‚Äì27. Blatter, supported by the American and Asian confederations, defeated Hayatou by 139 votes to 56. Corruption allegations In November 2010 Andrew Jennings, the presenter of FIFA's Dirty Secrets, an edition of BBC's flagship current affairs programme Panorama alleged that Hayatou had taken bribes in the 1990s regarding the awarding of contracts for the sale of television rights to the football World Cup.\\"Panorama: Three FIFA World Cup officials took bribes\\", BBC (29 November 2010) Panorama claimed to have obtained a document from a company called ISL which showed that Hayatou was paid 100,000 French Francs by the company. ISL won the contract to distribute the television rights.

It is the most famous Russian horse. The breed was developed in Russia in the late 18th century by Count Alexei Orlov at his Khrenovskoy stud farm near the town of Bobrov (Voronezh Guberniya). The Orlovs emerged as the result of crossing various European mares (primarily of English, Dutch, Mecklenburg, and Danish breeding) with Arabian stallions. During the 19th century, Orlov trotters were used mainly for riding and harness racing by Russian nobility. They were valued for their beauty and elegance combined with the ability to work hard. They were also used for the improvement of other Russian horses. When harness racing became widespread at the end of the century, the Orlovs faced intense competition from American-developed Standardbreds, who are generally recognized as less refined but faster than Orlov trotters. Eventually Standardbred stallions were crossed with Orlov mares and a new breed, the Russian Trotter, appeared. The possibility of the extinction of the Orlovs was a concern in the 20th century because of crossbreeding and the Soviet disregard of horse-raising. However, the breed survived, and today fifteen stud farms in Russia and Ukraine raise pure- blooded Orlov Trotters. Development of the breed Smetanka The land that became Orlov's Khrenovsky stud farm was given to him by Catherine II (Catherine the Great) as a reward for his participation in the coup d'etat which brought her to the throne. The buildings were constructed by Giovanni Giliardi. The original estate was very large; the modern Khrenovsky stud area is fifteen times smaller than it was prior to the Bolshevik revolution. The ancestor of all Orlov Trotters was the purebred grey Arabian stallion Smetanka. Orlov bought him in Turkey for the enormous sum of 60,000 rubles.\\"History of the Russian Arabian.\\" Web site accessed March 29, 2007 Although he died the next year, he lived to sire five offspring. Among others he was crossed with Isabelline, a Danish mare from the Frederiksborg royal stud-farm, who foaled a stallion that was named Polkan (1778‚Äì1793). Polkan was crossed with a Dutch mare which, in 1784, produced the grey stallion Bars I (1784‚Äì1808), considered the first Orlov trotter. He was 162.5 cm high at the withers which made him taller than most contemporary trotters, possessed a fast trotting gait and featured the beauty and noble bearing which would later distinguish the newly created breed. For seventeen years Bars I was crossed with different mares and sired eleven stallions that carried his distinguishing characteristics. The emergence of the breed was the result of a thorough and elaborate selection process. About 3,000 horses kept at the stud were involved.\\"Orlov Trotter\\" Unlike many other Russian nobles who were fond of horse-raising, Orlov was a professional breeder who is also credited for creating some seventy different animal breeds including the Russian wolfhound. Orlov was very protective of his bloodstock, and would sell only geldings (castrated stallions). Even when Tsar Alexander I asked Orlov to sell him several stallions, Orlov only agreed to sell geldings. This rule was maintained for twenty years after Orlov's death. Later, when the Khrenovsky stud farm belonged to the Russian Crown, Trotters were then openly sold to private stud-owners. Orlov trotters in the 19th century Orlov Trotter in racing sleigh In 1809, the Khrenovsky stud-farm was inherited by Orlov's daughter Anna. Until 1831 Orlov's disciple, the former serf Vasily Shishkin, continued to develop the breed. However, in 1831, he left the Khrenovsky stud- farm and founded his own. Orlov's daughter lacked her father's competence in horse-breeding and the Khrenovsky stud-farm went downhill. Trotters were intensively crossed with various European breeds in order to increase their dimensions and their quality fell. In 1845, the stud-farm passed into the hands of the Crown, but for some time this only made matters worse. It was able to regain its fame only some decades later. In 1881, the Khrenovsky stud- farm stopped raising all breeds except for Orlov trotters. The best Orlov trotters were now raised in private stud-farms such as the Shishkin's. Count Alexey Orlov driving Bars the First, by N. Sverhckov In 1834, a Trotting Society was established in Moscow, and regular races began. Orlov trotters had already proved to be the best racing horses in Russia and soon they proved to be the best in Europe. In 1867, Orlov trotter Beduin made headlines when, at World's Fair in Paris, it covered 3500 feet in 1 minute 32 seconds ‚Äì 4 seconds ahead the fastest Standardbred mare, Flora Temple. Since then many trotters have been sold abroad where they greatly contributed to the creation of local trotting breeds. Meanwhile, in the US, Standardbreds were gradually improved until they were able to outrace Orlov trotters. In 1877, harness racing totalisator emerged in Russia and this led to crucial changes in breeding Orlovs. Many stud-farmers turned to raising racing horses who were not as large and hard-working or as beautiful and elegant as traditional Orlov trotters. Since Standardbreds were, in general, faster than Orlov trotters, these breeds were intensively crossed. The resulting breed was called Russian trotters and they lacked many distinctive features of Orlov trotters. They were smaller and lighter and were not capable of doing as much work as Orlov trotters. In order to prevent Orlov trotters from disappearing through mixing with Standardbreds, the government introduced separate races for Orlov trotters and Standardbreds. Finally Russian stud-farmers managed to improve the racing performance of Orlov trotters. Stallion Krepysh born in 1904 won 55 races and covered 1 mile for 2 minutes 8.5 seconds. He was the fastest trotter in pre-revolutionary Russia. Krepysh and most of his issue died during the Russian civil war. In the Soviet Union An Orlov Trotter as used in a Soviet kolkhoz. The Civil war was a major disaster for horse breeding in Russia. Many horses died in battle, yet more were eaten for food, and there was a general collapse of the economy, making horse breeding a luxury few could afford. However, after 1920, the raising of Orlov Trotters resumed and crossbreeding was forbidden. At that time, Orlov trotters were used primarily for farming and transport due to their physical strength and outstanding working abilities. By the 1930s, race breeding had also been reestablished and pre-revolutionary racing records were being broken. Arguably, the Orlovs reached their second heyday in the 1930s. During World War II, also known as the Soviet-German war, the number of Orlov Trotters again decreased. After the war, the state acutely needed horses in order to restore agricultural production. Due to their working ability and high productivity, Orlov trotters were again widely used to improve local horses. However, by 1953, the Soviet authorities decided that, in part due to increased use of the tractor, horse- raising was not important for the economy. This resulted in reduction of the number of stud farms and less governmental support of those that remained. Today Present-day Orlov Trotter After the fall of the Soviet Union, the future of the breed seemed unclear since rich Russians interested in harness racing preferred the faster Russian and American trotters. Therefore, in 1997, the International Committee for the Protection of the Orlov Trotter was established. Purebred Orlov trotters are now raised on twelve stud farms in Russia and three in Ukraine. The studs in Russia have a total of about 800 mares, which raises some concern; it is a general rule that a horse breed with fewer than 1000 female individuals is in danger.–û—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä—ã—Å–∞–∫ Breed Characteristics The Orlov trotters are in general taller and more robust than Standardbreds. The average current measurements for Orlov breeding stallions are 161.4 cm (height at withers), 164 cm (body length/barrel), 186 cm (chest circumference), 20.4 cm (cannon bone circumference) and for breeding mares are 160.3 cm, 163.6 cm, 186.2 cm and 20.1 cm respectively. In appearance, the Orlovs are characterized by a big head, large expressive eyes, a long and naturally arched neck set high, prominent withers and broad croup. The body is muscular. The legs are strongly built, with prominent joints and clearly defined tendons. Due to its Arabian origins, many Orlovs are grey, at maturity, though all are born a darker colour at birth. (Grey horses are born dark and slowly lighten as they age until their hair coat is completely white.) At maturity, the colors of Orlovs are: grey (46%), black (28%), bay (20%) or chestnut (5%).

The preprophase band is a microtubule array found in plant cells that are about to undergo cell division and enter the preprophase stage of the plant cell cycle. Besides the phragmosome, it is the first microscopically visible sign that a plant cell is about to enter mitosis. The preprophase band was first observed and described by Jeremy Pickett-Heaps and Donald Northcote at Cambridge University in 1966. Just before mitosis starts, the preprophase band forms as a dense band of microtubules around the phragmosome and the future division plane just below the plasma membrane. It encircles the nucleus at the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle when dividing cells enter the G2 phase of the cell cycle after DNA replication is complete. The preprophase band consists mainly of microtubules and microfilaments (actin) and is generally 2-3 ¬µm wide. When stained with fluorescent markers, it can be seen as two bright spots close to the cell wall on either side of the nucleus. Plant cells lack centrosomes as microtubule organizing centers. Instead, the microtubules of the mitotic spindle aggregate on the nuclear surface and are reoriented to form the spindle at the end of prophase. The preprophase band also functions in properly orienting the mitotic spindle, and contributes to efficient spindle formation during prometaphase The preprophase band disappears as soon as the nuclear envelope breaks down and the mitotic spindle forms, leaving behind an actin-depleted zone. However, its position marks the future fusion sites for the new cell plate with the existing cell wall during telophase. When mitosis is completed, the cell plate and new cell wall form starting from the center along the plane occupied by the phragmosome. The cell plate grows outwards until it fuses with the cell wall of the dividing cell at exactly the spots predicted by the position of the preprophase band.  Bibliography  *P.H. Raven, R.F.

From the circumstances related by him, it appears that they were the most easterly of the Ligurian tribes, who inhabited the lofty group of mountains bordering on Etruria, and appear to have occupied the valleys of the Macra (modern Magra) and Ausar (modern Serchio). Although they extended eastwards along the chain of the Apennines to the frontiers of the Arretines and the territory of Mutina (modern Modena) and Bononia (modern Bologna), the upper valley of the Macra about Pontremoli, including the area later known as Lunigiana where the Tuscan towns of Aulla, Fivizzano, Fosdinovo, Villfranca and Pontremoli are now found, and the adjoining Upper Garfagnana and Ligurian districts of Sarzana and La Spezia were their center. To oppose their inroads, the Romans generally made Pisae (modern Pisa) the headquarters of one of their armies, and from thence carried their arms into the heart of the mountains: but their successes seldom effected more than to compel the enemy to disperse and take refuge in their villages and castles, of which the latter were mountain fastnesses in which they were generally able to defy the Roman arms. They are first mentioned in 187 BCE, when we are told that they were defeated and reduced to submission by the consul C. Flaminius; but the next year they appear again in arms, and defeated the consul Q. Marcius, with the loss of 4,000 men and three standards (plus standards of the Roman ally). The place of the battle was located by historian Lorenzo Marcuccetti, using references left by Titus Livius, in the territory of Seravezza. In fact, according to Titus Livius the places was named, after the battle, Saltus Marcius (saltus meaning a drop or a height difference and Marcius from the name of the consul) and today the hill above the supposed place of the battle, placed in a narrow gorge, still bear the name \\"Colle Marcio\\" (Marcio Hill). Others historic and logical evidences led to believe that this was the place of the battle (see Lorenzo Marcuccetti, Saltus Marcius. La sconfitta di Roma contro la Nazione Ligure-Apuana, Petrartedizioni, Lucca 2002). This disaster was avenged the next year, but after several successive campaigns the consuls for the year 181-180 BCE, P. Cornelius and M. Baebius, had recourse to the expedient of removing the whole nation from their abodes, and transporting them, to the number of 40,000, including women and children, into the heart of Samnium. Here they were settled in the vacant plains, which had formerly belonged to Taurasia (hence called Campi Taurasini), and appear to have become a flourishing community. The next year 7,000 more, who had been in the first instance suffered to remain, were removed by the consul Fulvius to join their countrymen. We meet with them long afterwards among the populi of Samnium, subsisting as a separate community, under the name of Ligures Baebiani et Corneliani, as late as the reign of TrajanLiv. xxxix. 2, 20, 32, xl. 1, 38, 41; Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Lib.

The establishment of Roman colonies at Pisae and Luca (modern Lucca) a few years afterwards tended to consolidate the conquest thus obtained, and established the Roman dominion permanently as far as the Macra and the key Roman port of Luna (modern Luni) where a Latin colony had been established in 177 B.C.

Plot A brief sketch of Irish history since the Easter Rising of 1916 is drawn, in which the hopes of the revolutionary founders of the Irish Free State for a republican society are dashed. The writer Se√°n √ì Faol√°in argues that what emerged was a society of \\"urbanized peasants\\" without moral courage who observed a self-interested silence in a \\"constant alliance\\" with an \\"obscurantist\\" and \\"uncultivated\\" church. The film covers the continuing dominance of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy with scenes of hunting and equestrian events. The country's lack of independence from American foreign policy is touched on; Conor Cruise O'Brien is critical of Ireland's following of American policy in the United Nation's General Assembly since 1957, and argues that Ireland should follow Sweden's more independent lead. The Editor of The Irish Times, Douglas Gageby, is in favour of open debate over the contraceptive pill in the correspondence columns of his newspaper, and reflects on the emerging difficulties of censorship. He points out the difficulties of the older generation adapting to change, while people under thirty are more positive. Students at Trinity College, Dublin though, are critical of the Irish media, including The Irish Times. A policy of the 500,000 strong Gaelic Athletic Association, finally dropped in 1971, is discussed. This was for the suspension of members found to have watched or participated in the foreign, or more precisely the 'English', sports of soccer, cricket, rugby and hockey. The ban applied to clubs whose activities included these pastimes. The emigration of Irish writers is viewed as the country's most \\"notorious\\" export because of state censorship. A roll call of native and international writers whose work had been banned is accompanied by church bells rung as at a funeral. A member of the censorship appeal board is interviewed. Professor Liam √ì Briain contrasts Ireland with Britain where he sees the complete loss of faith, moral values and the abolition of \\"sin\\". He recounts that a friend, Jimmy Montgomery, while film censor, had to make decisions \\"for a while\\" on sound films before the equipment to hear the soundtrack had arrived. √ì Briain though, does recognise the difficulties of sustaining faith in the context of scientific and philosophical developments. The hold of the clergy on education in schools and colleges is pointed out. In a Christian Brothers school, a class of schoolboys, in Lennon's old classroom,Peter Lennon in The Making of 'The Rocky Road to Dublin. are shown regurgitating the catechism on the effects of original sin. Irish schools were single sex only. For this reason, contact between adolescents and young of both sexes for the middle classes is restricted to the tennis club dance halls where strict decorum is observed. Irish women are depicted as passive, always waiting for men to make contact with them. The old ways there are contrasted with a much more modern working class venue. The \\"close involvement\\" of Irish politicians with the clergy is seen as \\"not so much a villainous conspiracy as a bad habit\\". Before the Second Vatican Council the role of the clergy was \\"not to disturb the simple faith of the people\\". Subsequently, the hierarchy \\"reluctantly\\" allowed some relaxation. Father Michael Cleary, posthumously the subject of a scandal, is shown singing a secular song \\"Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy\\" in a women's hospital ward. At a wedding reception he is an active participant. In an interview, he sees this show of camaraderie as a means of reaching the young, and showing himself to be \\"on their wavelength\\". He insists the clergy is not against sex, and that celibacy is a problem for the priest; \\"personally\\" he would wish to be married and have a family, but their absence is a sacrifice he makes as a priest. The Catholic clergy's grip on family life is examined. An anonymous \\"young married woman\\" relates her history. After three children in as many years, the couple practice Coitus interruptus in the safe period. At confession, the priest tells her to sleep separately from her husband rather than participate in his sin. They do however stop their method of contraception, and the woman miscarries. Though she remains a practising Catholic, priests and doctors are seen as solely being on the side of men. The clerical and political orthodoxy outlined is viewed as being about to change. Though he is critical of \\"pop orchestras\\" and \\"jazz bands\\", the censor √ì Briain, wishes the emerging world well and hopes it will develop its own traditions. The film ends on a freeze frame of two boys in a boat; one of them is looking straight at the camera. Production Peter Lennon, then a junior feature writer for The Guardian in Paris, was told by friends in his week back in Dublin covering the theatre festival, that Ireland was changing: \\"'censorship was a thing of the past' they told me.\\" No one paid any attention to the clergy, it was claimed. Gaining permission from his newspaper to write a series of articles about the situation in Ireland, he found this was not so. The articles gained much notice lasting over a year, and he was able to make the film when his friend, Victor Herbert, who had made a fortune selling mutual funds, agreed to finance it. Half of the film was shot in the gap before Raoul Coutard was committed to shooting Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black and the remainder before his commitment to Godard's Week End.Lennon's contribution to the Making documentary is contradictory. At first it seems to have been made in a fortnight shoot before the Truffaut movie, to which Coutard is supposed to have been committed for seven months, then it seems to have been shot in two-halves. Because of Coutard's comments in his interview, the second account is taken as being verifiable. At the time, Lennon chose to use the cameraman because Coutard was the only person he was aware able to shoot in an informal way.Interview with Lennon in a 1967 BBC film by Gavin Millar on Coutard, extracted in the Making documentary. Although shot in colour, it was printed in black-and-white, partly because of the experimental and unstable reversal film stock used, and partly because Lennon thought that monochrome was more in keeping with the tone of the film. Response in Ireland The film could not be officially banned, since it contained no sex, but the Irish government did prevent it from being screened in cinemas or by state broadcaster RT√â. After a single press screening in Dublin in 1967 ‚Äì which provoked a hostile reaction from newspapers and RT√â ‚Äì Lennon entered it for that year's Cork Film Festival, but it was rejected on the grounds that it had already been shown in the capital. It was only when the film was chosen to represent Ireland at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival that the Cork organisers were embarrassed into changing their decision at the next festival ‚Äì held in September 1968. However, the organisers gave it a lunchtime screening on the day that all the media covering the Festival were invited \\"to a free oyster-and-Guinness lunch in Kenmore, 70 miles away.\\"In Portrait of a brainwashed society by Peter Lennon in The Guardian, 11 October 2004, he wrote it was in Kenmore (sic). However, in The Making of Rocky Road Lennon states the lunch was, \\"in Kinsale, 20 miles away.\\" Lennon organised his own screening in Cork the following day, the resulting furore leading to a single Dublin cinema ‚Äì the International Film Theatre ‚Äì giving it a seven-week run to packed audiences. At Cannes, it was chosen as one of eight films to be shown during critics' week at the 1968 Festival, but immediately after the screening Coutard's sometime collaborators Fran√ßois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard declared the Festival suspended in sympathy with the Paris students' strike, leading to a furious debate with Lennon and other filmmakers present. Despite this, screenings were organised for the same students, as well as striking workers besieged in the Renault plant. The de facto ban in Ireland remained in place for more than thirty years ‚Äì barring sporadic private screenings in the 1990s ‚Äì until the film was restored in 2004 by the Irish Film Board and Loopline Films. At the same time, a new documentary, The Making of Rocky Road, was made by Paul Duane, examining the history of Rocky Road, and including BBC footage of Coutard and Lennon shooting Rocky Road in 1967,New Release, BBC2, 30 March 1967 and previously unseen film of the events in Cannes in 1968. Both films were released on DVD (Region 0 PAL) in 2005.

They either have true left-handed guitars or have right-handed guitars altered so the strings are correct for a left-handed player. Some guitarists in this category (e.g. Paul McCartney) play both genuine left-handed instruments and right-handed instruments altered for left-handed playing. Changing the strings on a right-handed guitar involves several things. The nut of the guitar has to be changed to accommodate the string widths.

Lauded for its realistic portrayal of the average American family, the series stars Roseanne Barr, and revolves around the Conners, an Illinois working-class family. In the ninth season, Roseanne and her family win the lottery and associate with \\"high society\\". In the final episode Roseanne reveals not only was she writing a story and they did not win the lottery, but also says Dan had actually died from a heart attack in season 8. In season 10 it is revealed that Dan did not die. Roseanne fabricated that as well, along with a multitude of other things. This set most things back as they were in season 8, with the exception of the birth of Darlene's daughter. Barr said the lottery storyline was done to illustrate the American Dream philosophy. On May 16, 2017, it was announced ABC would produce an eight-episode 10th season revival of the series, set to air as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with the original cast returning. In November 2017, it was announced that ABC had ordered an additional episode for the new season bringing the total up to 9. The tenth season debuted on March 27, 2018. On March 30, 2018, the series was renewed for an eleventh season of 13 episodes by ABC, but was canceled on May 29, 2018 due to a racial comment made by Roseanne on Twitter about former- president Barack Obama's aide Valerie Jarrett. On June 21, 2018, the show was revived as a spin-off entitled The Conners, which has the same cast as Roseanne after her character dies of a drug overdose. The show premiered on October 16, 2018 and comprised 11 episodes. A second season premiered on September 24, 2019 and comprised 20 episodes. A third season is set to premier on October 21, 2020 and comprising of 19 episodes.

Its position on working towards addressing climate change, stresses cooperation with big business in order to achieve significant progress on the issue. The party therefore advocates a close working relationship between environmentalists and the business community. The CCC was registered as a political party with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 4 September 2007 and deregistered on 25 March 2010. 2007 New South Wales state election When it was first conceived and established in 2006, the Climate Change Coalition was not initially a political party, but rather a grouping of independents. The first election that it contested was the New South Wales March 2007 state election. The CCC ran a group of 21 candidates (dubbed by detractors the \\"Gang of 21\\", an allusion to the Gang of Four) standing for the Legislative Council, the NSW Upper House of Parliament . Heading this group was Patrice Newell, an author and biodynamic beef farmer. The CCC received criticism from some groups, for refusing to advocate preferences, under the Australian preferential voting system, to other political parties with strong environmental credentials. The group was not registered as a political party in NSW and so under NSW electoral law could not display a party name on the ballot paper at the top of the group column. The 21 \\"Group F\\" candidates polled 18,999 votes in total, or 0.50% of the total formal vote, and were therefore well short of the quota of 173,239 (4.55%) required for election of any candidate.NSW Electoral Commission: Legislative Council First Preference Summary 2007 Australian federal election The Climate Change Coalition was registered as a political party by the AEC on 4 September 2007.Climate Change Coalition, Australian Electoral Commission.Party Registration Decision: Climate Change Coalition, Australian Electoral Commission. The party announced it intended to run candidates for the Australian Senate in the 2007 federal election. The party's NSW Senate candidates were Patrice Newell and Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, a well-known scientist and media personality.Doherty, Ben: Dr Karl's Senate experiment, The Age, 28 September 2007. The party fielded candidates for the senate in each of the other states with the exception of Tasmania, and also fielded a candidate in the ACT. The candidates were; in Western Australia Gary Warden, and Sarah Bishop; in South Australia, Dr Colin Edean and Vidas Kublilus; in Queensland, Phil Johnson and Steven Posselt; and in Victoria, Ainslie Howard. The ACT senate candidate was Michael Fullam- Stone. With a favourable ballot paper placement (column E) and with the party's name shown on the ballot paper the party scored 0.83% of the vote in NSW (a 0.33% increase on its NSW state election result) but failed to secure the election of any of its candidates. Results in other states were in the range 0.27% (in Western Australia) to 0.78% (in Victoria). Nationwide the party received 78,710 votes (0.62%).Australian Electoral Commission: Senate first preferences by Group, 2007 Preferences During the 2007 Federal election, the Climate Change Coalition was criticised for the way it distributed its preferences, with some parties antithetical to the policies of the Climate Change Coalition placed higher on Senate group voting tickets than others with more similar positions on the issue.Australian Electoral Commission: 2007 Federal Election - group voting tickets Political journalist Malcolm Farr observed that \\"Hanson, the Queensland political relic standing for the Senate, has managed a preference deal with the snooty CCC...\\".

The flow of preferences did not affect the election of the Greens' Scott Ludlam to the final Senate position in WA.Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Antony Green's 2007 WA Senate preference flow analysis According to the Party, the allocation of preferences was determined to give the greatest chance of electoral success, but may have worked to reduce its primary vote support.

In the , Amberley had a population of 253 people.  Geography  Australia's biggest air force base, the RAAF Base Amberley is situated here and the Bureau of Meteorology has a weather observation station in Amberley. To the south of Amberley is the Fassifern Valley. The Jeebropilly coal mine is located just to the west of Amberley.  History  The suburb is named after Amberley in the United Kingdom. The name was used by James and Martha Collett for their residence in the 1850s as it was their hometown. In 1861, a school commenced at Willowbank on a sheep and cattle station owned by Darby McGrath. McGrath then asked the Queensland Government to take over and donated land for the construction of a new building, resulting in the opening of Warrill Creek State School opened on 22 May 1862 on what is now the south-western part of the RAAF Base Amberley. On 28 January 1888 the school relocated to a new site at Sandridge but it was flooded in 1893 by Warrill Creek. In 1903, it was renamed Amberley State School. This school is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland. The outbreak of World War II escalated activity on the air force base and it was decided to close the school at the end of 1941 and it re-opened at the start of 1947. Concerns about aircraft noise at the school lead to the construction of a new school on Rosewood Road further from the base in the late 1970s. On 1 January 2010, the school was again relocated to Deebing Creek Road, Yamanto and renamed Amberley District State School. In the , Amberley had a population of 253 people.  Education  There are no schools in Amberley. The nearest primary schools are Amberley District State School in neighbouring Yamanto to the east, Walloon State School in neighbouring Walloon to the north-west and Leichhardt State School in neighbouring Leichhardt to the north-east. The nearest secondary schools are Bremer State High School in Ipswich to the east and Rosewood State High School in Rosewood to the north-east. Climate Amberley has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot humid summers and cool, crisp winters that have a high diurnal range which provide frost in some mornings. Its lowest temperature of -4.9 degrees Celsius occurred on the 8 August 1995, when southern Queensland suffered a severe cold snap. The previous coldest temperature was -4.3 degrees reached on 29 July 1994. The town is fairly sunny, receiving 110.3 clear days.Jack Frost makes his icy presence felt. Page 3.

A number of etymologies (some of them folk etymologies) have been proposed, all of which suggest that the name was derived from the languages of local indigenous peoples, the historic Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Miami. Some of the theories are: # It is derived from the Potawatomi word negikanamazo, which is variously translated as \\"otter tail\\" or \\"stones like otters.\\" This could refer to area wildlife. This interpretation was apparently suggested by Henry Schoolcraft, a US Indian agent in the region in the 19th century. # Another popular account is the legend of a Potawatomi warrior named Fleet Foot. In order to win his bride, he was required to run from his settlement to a point on the river and back before a pot of water boiled away. This event is thought to have occurred in 1810, a couple of decades before the first whites settled permanently here. The Potawatomi word kikalamezo appears on an 1823 atlas of the area. The word translates as \\"boiling pot\\" or \\"place where the water boils,\\"Michigan Counties, Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment. and refers to the Fleet Foot legend. # The \\"boiling pot\\" translation may also refer to various nearby bends in the river that resemble pots. # Alternative translations of kikalamezo include \\"beautiful water,\\" \\"mirage\\" or \\"reflecting waters,\\" and could refer to the once-clear waters of the river, which are now somewhat clouded by pollution.Clarke Historical Museum, Kalamazoo etymology, Kalamazoo County Central Michigan University. # The current name used by the local Ojibwa and Odawa tribes for Kalamazoo is Giikanaamozoog, this means, \\"They have been smoked/cured.\\" The explanation given for this name is that the dark waters of the Kalamazoo River have a smokey appearance. # It may also have referred to a place to ford the river. The city was originally established near one of the few places in the area where it was easy to cross by wading. #Early official papers refer to the name of Kalamazoo as derived from a Potawatomi term meaning \\"the area where animals wounded by Indians crawl to die.\\" In his Indian Names in Michigan (1986), Virgil Vogel explained that when Kalamazoo County was formed on July 30, 1830, it \\"was allegedly named from the 'Indian' name of the river, Ke-kanaamazoo, 'the boiling pot'.\\" There had been various transliterations of the term. In the 1821 Treaty of Chicago, the village of Match-e-be narh-she-wish, was described as at the head of the \\"Kekalamazoo river\\" (this village became the present-day city). Vogel suggests the following interpretations for the source of Kalamazoo as more credible than other accounts: * a corruption of Ojibwe kikikamagad, meaning \\"it goes or runs fast\\" * a mangled form of Kalimink, which is also the name of a creek in Ingham County * a mangled form of Killomick, a variant of an early name for the Calumet River, which meant \\"deep, still water\\" Vogel suggests that the word \\"may be from the Miami, because of the presence of l.\\" He cites Father Chrysostam Verwyst saying the name Kalamazoo comes from Ojibwe as a \\"corruption of Kikanamsoso\\", meaning \\"it smokes, or he is troubled with smoke\\", and pronounced \\"kee-kah-nah-mo-zo or kee-kau-nau-mo-zo\\". Vogel cites William R. Gerard as concurring in this opinion, that \\"Kalamazoo is a slight alteration of older Ojibwe kikal√¢moza, meaning 'he is inconvenienced by smoke in his lodge'.\\" Vogel cites Gerard as dismissing Schoolcraft's opinion that the name was from negikanamazoo, or \\"otters beneath the surface\\" as an \\"etymological absurdity\\". However, Vogel also suggests that both Verwyst and Gerard accounts also \\"deserve this label\\". Vogel also dismisses the view that the name means \\"mirage or reflecting river\\".

It is a television adaptation of the novel of the same name by Morton Freedgood (writing under the pseudonym John Godey), and is a remake of the 1974 classic. It was followed by the 2009 remake.  Premise  Edward James Olmos plays Detective Anthony Piscotti, a New York City police officer. He is trying to crack the taking of a subway train where the antagonists are holding the passengers for ransom.  Cast  * Edward James Olmos as Detective Anthony Piscotti * Vincent D'Onofrio as Mr. Blue * Richard Schiff as Mr. Green * Donnie Wahlberg as Mr. Grey * Lisa Vidal as Babs Cardoza * Kenneth Welsh as Caz Hollowitz * Lorraine Bracco as Detective Ray * Tara Rosling as Mr. Brown * Ben Cook as Older boy on subway * Bobby Boriello as Younger boy on subway * Bobby O'Neill as Homeboy on subway (as Black Katt) * Ingrid Veninger as Graduate student on subway * Alisa Wiegers as Office worker [\\"Shaky\\"] * Peter Boretski as Old man on subway * Stuart Clow as Jogger * Michael A. Miranda as Denny Alcala * Sandi Ross as Mrs. Jenkins * Louis Del Grande as Frank Stonehouse * Gary Reineke as Deputy Mayor * Richard Fitzpatrick as Borough commander * Roy Lewis as Officer Artis Washington * Philip Akin as ESU lieutenant * Judah Katz as TV reporter * Catherine Blythe as Video camerawoman  Production details  The film is a remake, with Edward James Olmos in the Walter Matthau role and Vincent D'Onofrio replacing Robert Shaw as the senior hijacker. Although not particularly well received by critics or viewers, this version was reportedly more faithful to the book, specifically in the rigging of the hijacked train for the getaway. The film was shot in Toronto's TTC subway system, mainly using the system's station platform Bay (TTC), St. Andrew (TTC) station and Museum (TTC) station, and two of a class of older cars being retired by the TTC. The two cars were shipped by road to the scrapyard the day after filming ended, still disguised as New York cars. The Toronto subway cars used for filming cannot operate singly, so a two-car set was used. A phony cab was built on the other end of H-1 car 5482 to simulate single car operation. The single car supposedly detached from the front of the train can be seen on several occasions to be part of a train of at least two cars. The most obvious cases are when rounding curves: once when first moving forward after being detached, and later when Anthony has just figured out the hijackers' plan. = Differences from the novel = Since the film was produced much later than the original, there are also additions to the film that did not exist in the original. For example, one of the characters sets up an IBM ThinkPad laptop computer, connected wirelessly to a motion detector that he places on the track. Later in the film, another character views the screen to see an approaching person, whom he confronts in the tunnel. The ransom demand in the remake was $5 million as opposed to $1 million in the original film and the novel.  Home media  In 2012, TGG Direct released the film on DVD in full frame in a two-pack that also included Runaway Train (1985).

They are synthesized by the addition of cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine to diglycerides, releasing cytidine monophosphate. S-Adenosyl methionine can subsequently methylate the amine of phosphatidylethanolamines to yield phosphatidylcholines. It can mainly be found in the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Function The major membrane lipids PtdCho - Phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn - Phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns -Phosphatidylinositol; PtdSer - Phosphatidylserine. =In cells= Phosphatidylethanolamines are found in all living cells, composing 25% of all phospholipids. In human physiology, they are found particularly in nervous tissue such as the white matter of brain, nerves, neural tissue, and in spinal cord, where they make up 45% of all phospholipids. Phosphatidylethanolamines play a role in membrane fusion and in disassembly of the contractile ring during cytokinesis in cell division. Additionally, it is thought that phosphatidylethanolamine regulates membrane curvature. Phosphatidylethanolamine is an important precursor, substrate, or donor in several biological pathways. As a polar head group, phosphatidylethanolamine creates a more viscous lipid membrane compared to phosphatidylcholine. For example, the melting temperature of di-oleoyl- phosphatidylethanolamine is -16 ¬∞C while the melting temperature of di-oleoyl- phosphatidylcholine is -20 ¬∞C. If the lipids had two palmitoyl chains, phosphatidylethanolamine would melt at 63 ¬∞C while phosphatidylcholine would melt already at 41 ¬∞C.See references in Wan et al. Biochemistry 47 2008 Lower melting temperatures correspond, in a simplistic view, to more fluid membranes. =In humans= In humans, metabolism of phosphatidylethanolamine is thought to be important in the heart. When blood flow to the heart is restricted, the asymmetrical distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine between membrane leaflets is disrupted, and as a result the membrane is disrupted. Additionally, phosphatidylethanolamine plays a role in the secretion of lipoproteins in the liver. This is because vesicles for secretion of very low- density lipoproteins coming off of the Golgi have a significantly higher phosphatidylethanolamine concentration when compared to other vesicles containing very low-density lipoproteins. Phosphatidylethanolamine has also shown to be able to propagate infectious prions without the assistance of any proteins or nucleic acids, which is a unique characteristic of it. Phosphatidylethanolamine is also thought to play a role in blood clotting, as it works with phosphatidylserine to increase the rate of thrombin formation by promoting binding to Factor V and Factor X, two proteins which catalyze the formation of thrombin from prothrombin. The synthesis of endocannabinoid anandamide is performed from the phosphatidylethanolamine by the successive action of 2 enzymes, the N-acetyltransferase and phospholipase-D =In bacteria= Where phosphatidylcholine is the principal phospholipid in animals, phosphatidylethanolamine is the principal one in bacteria. One of the primary roles for phosphatidylethanolamine in bacterial membranes is to spread out the negative charge caused by anionic membrane phospholipids. In the bacterium E. coli, phosphatidylethanolamine play a role in supporting lactose permeases active transport of lactose into the cell, and may play a role in other transport systems as well. Phosphatidylethanolamine plays a role in the assembly of lactose permease and other membrane proteins. It acts as a 'chaperone' to help the membrane proteins correctly fold their tertiary structures so that they can function properly. When phosphatidylethanolamine is not present, the transport proteins have incorrect tertiary structures and do not function correctly. Phosphatidylethanolamine also enables bacterial multidrug transporters to function properly and allows the formation of intermediates that are needed for the transporters to properly open and close. Structure Ethanolamine As a lecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine consists of a combination of glycerol esterified with two fatty acids and phosphoric acid. Whereas the phosphate group is combined with choline in phosphatidylcholine, it is combined with the ethanolamine in phosphatidylethanolamine. The two fatty acids may be the same, or different, and are usually in the 1,2 positions (though they can be in the 1,3 positions). Synthesis The phosphatidylserine decarboxylation pathway and the cytidine diphosphate- ethanolamine pathways are used to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is the enzyme that is used to decarboxylate phosphatidylserine in the first pathway. The phosphatidylserine decarboxylation pathway is the main source of synthesis for phosphatidylethanolamine in the membranes of the mitochondria. Phosphatidylethanolamine produced in the mitochondrial membrane is also transported throughout the cell to other membranes for use. In a process that mirrors phosphatidylcholine synthesis, phosphatidylethanolamine is also made via the cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine pathway, using ethanolamine as the substrate. Through several steps taking place in both the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, the synthesis pathway yields the end product of phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylethanolamine is also found abundantly in soy or egg lecithin and is produced commercially using chromatographic separation. =Regulation= Synthesis of Phosphatidylethanolamine through the phosphatidylserine decarboxylation pathway occurs rapidly in the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, phosphatidylserine is made in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because of this, the transport of phosphatidylserine from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondrial membrane and then to the inner mitochondrial membrane limits the rate of synthesis via this pathway. The mechanism for this transport is currently unknown, but may play a role in regulation of the rate of synthesis in this pathway. Presence in food, health issues Phosphatidylethanolamines in food break down to form phosphatidylethanolamine-linked Amadori products as a part of the Maillard reaction. These products accelerate membrane lipid peroxidation, causing oxidative stress to cells that come in contact with them. Oxidative stress is known to cause food deterioration and several diseases. Significant levels of Amadori-phosphatidylethanolamine products have been found in a wide variety of foods such as chocolate, soybean milk, infant formula, and other processed foods. The levels of Amadori-phosphatidylethanolamine products are higher in foods with high lipid and sugar concentrations that have high temperatures in processing. Additional studies have found that Amadori- phosphatidylethanolamine may play a role in vascular disease, act as the mechanism by which diabetes can increase the incidence of cancer, and potentially play a role in other diseases as well. Amadori- phosphatidylethanolamine has a higher plasma concentration in diabetes patients than healthy people, indicating it may play a role in the development of the disease or be a product of the disease.

Properties  Individually, tantalum and hafnium carbide have the highest melting points among the binary compounds, and , respectively, and their \\"alloy\\" with a composition Ta4HfC5 is believed to have a melting point of . Very few measurements of melting point in tantalum hafnium carbide have been reported, because of the obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures. A 1965 study of the TaC-HfC solid solutions at temperatures 2225‚Äì2275 ¬∞C found a minimum in the vaporization rate and thus maximum in the thermal stability for Ta4HfC5. This rate was comparable to that of tungsten and was weakly dependent on the initial density of the samples, which were sintered from TaC-HfC powder mixtures, also at 2225‚Äì2275 ¬∞C. In a separate study, Ta4HfC5 was found to have the minimum oxidation rate among the TaC-HfC solid solutions.

He is one of the writers whose letters survive from late Roman Gaul, depicting the influence of the Visigoths on the Roman lifestyle. He should not be confused with his son-in-law, Saint Rusticus (Archbishop of Lyon). Life Little is known about the life of Ruricius, and some of what information is available is not certain. He is one of four Gallo-Roman aristocrats of the fifth- to sixth-century whose letters survive in quantity: the others include Sidonius Apollinaris, urban prefect of Rome in 468 and bishop of Clermont (died 485), Alcimus Ecdicius Avitus, Bishop of Vienne (died 518); and Magnus Felix Ennodius of Arles, Bishop of Ticinum (died 534). All of them were linked in a tightly bound, Gallo-Roman aristocratic network that provided the bishops of Catholic Gaul.Mathisen 1981, p.107. Although there is scarce information about Ruricius' life, it is known that he eventually became a grandfather, suggesting he must have lived to be at least 65 or 70. He may have died as early as 506 to as late as 510, so this puts his birth date around 440.Mathisen 1999, p.19. Likewise, there is no information concerning his birthplace, though he appears to have had strong ties to Aquitaine in the region of Cahors, and there is significant information regarding his family. =Ancestry= According to Venantius Fortunatus, Ruricius was a member of the Anician family, one of the most important aristocratic families in Rome.Venantius Fortunatus, Carmina, 4.5; translated in Mathisen, p. 253 The details of his ancestry has been a subject of debate;between Stanford Mommaerts and Dave Kelley (1992), Christian Settipani (1991) and Ralph Mathisen (1999). Mathisen's explanation is that Ruricius was the son of a \\"Constantius\\" and a \\"Leontia\\" based on his premise that his paternal grandfather may have been Flavius Constantius Felix and his mother a member of the aristocratic familia Pontii Leontii of Burdigalia in Aquitania. Further evidence he provides includes (1) for Constantius, on the existence of an ivory consular diptych for Fl. Constantius Felix (cos. 428), patrician and magister militum from 425-430 at Limoges Mathisen 1999, p.21. and the fact that Ruricius had a son of that name, and (2) for Leontia,Mathisen 1999, p.24. the use of the name Leontius for Ruricius' brother and son. Christian Settipani agrees that Ruricius' mother was a member of the Pontii Leontii but does not make any specific reference as to who Ruricius' father might be.Settipani 1991, p. 196, 218. He argues that the name of the consul of 428 was in fact Flavius Felix and that the name \\"Constantius\\" was added in error which would make this person one of the Ennodii and that the Ennodii did not become related to Ruricius until the next generation through marriage to one of his sons by an Ennodian mother of Parthenius.Settipani 2002, p. 11. Mommaerts and Kelley propose that Ruricius may be the son of an African proconsul, name as yet unknown, but otherwise identified (by title) by Sidonius in his letter to Montius as the father of said Camillus. This would make Ruricius brother to Camillus and Firminus of Arles.Kelley and Mommaerts, 1992 p. 114. The objection to this hypothesis has been that it makes the unnamed African proconsul an otherwise unattested son of regicide emperor Petronius Maximus and that there are not any Firminid names among Ruricius' immediate descendants. Settipani now accepts Petronius Maximus as an Anicius but argues the unnamed African proconsul was unlikely to have been Maximus' son.Settipani 2000, p. 381. In support of the Kelley/Mommaerts hypothesis is the evidence in his letters of Ruricius' strong ties to Arles and an argument that the name \\"Firminus\\" in fact came into use among the Ferreoli through the marriage of Papianilla, whom they hypothesize to have been a sister of Ruricius, to Tonantius Ferreolus; however, the matter of Ruricius' paternal heritage remains controversial. Perhaps the oddest thing is Sidonius' uncharacteristic failure to enthuse about Ruricius' father, whoever he was. Perhaps since Ruricius was apparently at one point Sidonius' prot√©g√©, Sidonius may have felt it somehow inappropriate. Some suggest that nevertheless Ruricius may not have been an Anicius because he makes no reference in his surviving letters that he is related, nor does he communicate with any known member of the family.Mathisen 1999, p.4. On balance, the evidence of Venantius Fortunatus is rather more persuasive. =Marriage and children= Ruricius married Hiberia, the daughter of an Arvernian senator Ommatius, a descendant of a Patrician Gilliard 1979, p.686. who lived in the 4th century named Philagrius.Mathisen 1999, p. 22. It is noted that she participated in his conversion to religious life, and thus succession to the episcopal see of Limoges in about 485.Mathisen 1999, p.23. Though no direct evidence survives to say whether they had any daughters, it is known that Ruricius and Hiberia had five sons: Ommatius (eldest), Eparchius, Constantius, Leontius, and Aurelianus. Also, Ruricius had several grandchildren, and at least one great- grandchild.Mathisen 1999, p.25. =Bishop= During the late empire and after the Visigothic takeover of imperial Gaul, it was common for Gallo-Roman aristocrats to take refuge in church office, allowing not only retention of local influence, but also some personal security.Mathisen 1984, p.168. Incidentally, Ruricius was appointed bishop of Limoges after the death of king Euric on December 28, 484. Euric was succeeded by his son, Alaric II. He reigned throughout Ruricius‚Äô time as bishop, apparently making good use of, among other things, Ruricius' legal acumen, until Ruricius passed from the scene as stated before between late 506 and 510.Mathisen 1999, p.12. Apart from his letters, Ruricius' only other known physical legacy is the monastery and church of Saint Augustine, which he built ca. 485.Mathisen 1999, p.36. Writings Ruricius‚Äô collection of 83 letters, of which 12 are addressed to him, survive in a single manuscript called Codex Sangallensis 190.Mathisen 1981, p.108. They cover a period of about 30 years, and describe what happened in Gaul after the final Roman withdrawal just before 480. The letters give insight into what the life of the literate Roman population was like under barbarian rule; what changed, and what remained. For example, they make almost no note of the effect of the Visigoths on local life and activities, posing the question as to whether the locals were very much affected.Mathisen 1999, p.3. Most of Ruricius‚Äô correspondence was directed to nearby bishops, and people in his family.Mathisen 1999, p.31. Although he does have some renowned correspondents, for the most part, they are not well known. Finally, the letters of Ruricius shed light on the underlying circumstances surrounding the Battle of Vouill√©, near Poitiers in 507; a fundamental battle in Gallic history, since it is where the Franks defeated the Visigoths. Historiographical contribution =Controversy surrounding relevance= Ralph W. Mathisen, the translator of the most recent set of Ruricius‚Äô letters, writes that they are of great significance to our understanding of the survival of classical literature and the development of Western European religion and society. However, some historians criticize the letters because of their historical irrelevance. D.R. Bradley notes that the letters give insufficient information for either the ecclesiastical historian or the theologian because they neglect major contemporary events. His main argument is that Ruricius had the habit of sending verbal messages by the bearer of his letters; therefore his letters give no insight into the events of Visigothic Gaul.Bradley 1954, p.268. =Relation to contemporaries= Similar to historiographical controversy, it is argued that in comparison to other letter writers such as Sidonius Apollinaris, Avitus of Vienne, and Ennodius of Pavia, Ruricius is extremely silent on contemporary historical events. For instance, Ruricius makes no mention in his letters of developments such as the Frankish incursions into the Visigothic kingdom, but it can be assumed that they were of great concern.Mathisen 1999, p.39. Ruricius‚Äô correspondence is therefore more representative of typical late Roman aristocratic written transactions. As such, he provides a different, and valuable, perspective to the evidence of more politically active letter writers such as Augustine, Sidonius, Avitus, Ennodius and Cassiodorus. His letters distinguish themselves from those written by Sidonius, for example, many of whose letters were composed when Gaul was still a part of the Roman Empire. Mathisen notes that the neglect of Ruricius in translation is unfortunate, because he provides a picture of life in late Roman Gaul that significantly compliments that given by Sidonius. Ruricius is a valid representative of the ‚ÄúGallic rhetorical style‚Äù.Bradley 1954, p.168. =Epistolography= Ruricius‚Äô letters demonstrate the importance of letter writing, also known as epistolography. He had many famous contemporary correspondents, whose letters compliment his own, and vice versa. Epistolography was the most important means of preserving one‚Äôs aristocratic ties during the period of literary decline in late Roman Gaul, as the imperial literary traditions were removed.

Towns found in the valley include Harrisville, Kalbar, Roadvale, Warril View and Aratula. Fassifern Valley is known as a carrot- producing area, as well as for growing potatoes, onions, pumpkins and melons. It is one of four vegetable-producing regions in southern Queensland, the others being the Lockyer Valley, the eastern Darling Downs and the Granite Belt. The Cunningham Highway passes through the town of Aratula and along ridges in the upper valley towards Cunninghams Gap, Mount Mitchell and parts of the Main Range National Park. The Moogerah Peaks are a series of mountain peaks in the southeast of the catchment. To the east lies the valleys of the Logan River. Further to the west is the dry catchment of Laidley Creek and Lockyer Creek in the Lockyer Valley while Amberley is located just to the north of the valley. History Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, Yugarabul, Yuggera and Yuggerabul) is one of the Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland. There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. Captain Patrick Logan was the first European to explore the valley in 1827, during which he climbed Mount French. The valley was first settled by pastoralists during the 1840s. The first settlers in the area where John Cameron and his brother-in-law Robert Coulson. The pair had arrived on the Darling Downs only to find all the best land already taken up. They eventually established themselves in the Fassifern Valley where number of other pastoral runs were established in the following decades, nearly all with familial connections to John Cameron. Cameron named the valley Fassefern which was a Scottish name. Many of the sheep and cattle stations names from the 19th century became the names of villages and towns in the valley, such as Moogerah, Bromelton and Dugandan which was later to become known as Boonah. In September 1887, the Dugandan railway line was opened connecting Dugandan to the main line in the north. Timber-cutting served at least five sawmills in the area. The Mount Edwards railway line, a branch line of the Dugandan railway, serviced a number of towns in the valley between 1922 and 1960. Agriculture Warril Creek provides a reliable water source for irrigated crop vegetables. A weir has been constructed at Kents Lagoon. A cattle tick clearing facility is located in Silverdale. In the aftermath of Cyclone Oswald severe flooding in the valley removed top soil from lands which may take a decade to recover from. Moogerah Dam Lake Moogerah was built on Reynolds Creek which runs into Warril Creek a tributary of the Bremer River which drains the slopes to the west of Fassifern Valley. Irrigation allowed local farmers to diversify crops after dairy farming declined in the 1960s.

The paper focuses on news in Hamburg and area, and produces regional supplements with news from Norderstedt, Ahrensburg, Harburg, and Pinneberg. Politically the paper is mildly conservative, but usually pro- government, including during SPD administrations. History and profile Four previous Hamburg newspapers had the word Abendblatt (\\"Evening Newspaper\\") in their title, including one named the Hamburger Abendblatt, founded on 2 May 1820. This incarnation of the Hamburger Abendblatt, however, was first published after World War II beginning on 14 October 1948 with an initial edition of 60,000 copies. The paper received a publishing license from the Hamburg Senate and Mayor Max Brauer, making it the first daily paper of post- war Germany to receive a license from German rather than Allied occupation authorities. After about six months of operation, its circulation increased to 170,000 copies daily. Until the 1970s it was delivered in the afternoon, but it is now delivered in the early morning. From 1948 through 2013 Hamburger Abendblatt was published by Axel Springer AG. The paper is published by Funke Mediengruppe, who purchased it from Axel Springer effective 1 January 2014. The paper used to appear Monday through Saturday only, but since 29 October 2006 it has also published a Sunday edition to compete with the Hamburger Morgenpost's introduction of a Sunday edition on 5 November 2006.

The long river is the central part of the Gaularvassdraget watershed basin which covers about across the municipalities of Sunnfjord and Sogndal. The river is a good salmon fishing river. The river runs across the whole municipality of Gaular, and the river is the namesake of the municipality. Course The river begins as glacial runoff in the Gaularfjellet mountains and it runs through the municipalities of Sunnfjord and Sogndal. The glaciers that feed the river are Grovabreen, Jostefonn, and Troget, all three are located just west of the massive Jostedalsbreen glacier. The river starts up in the mountains and empties into a fjord at sea level, and so the water drops over in elevation throughout its course. This is one reason why the area is often referred to as Fosselandet (lit. \\"the land of waterfalls\\"). There are many waterfalls on the Gaular and its tributaries. The river Gaula begins as two main branches. The northern branch begins in the mountains east of the village of Haukedalen in F√∏rde Municipality. That branch flows to the southwest eventually into the lake Viksdalsvatnet. The southern branch begins at the lake Norddalsvatnet on the border of the municipalities of Sunnfjord and Sogndal. It flows along the border, then south into Sogndal to the lake Nyst√∏lsvatnet. The river then turns west, back into Sunnfjord municipality and it heads west until it empties into the lake Viksdalsvatnet. This lake is where the two branches join together. It then finishes its course by flowing westward, passing through the municipal center of Sande, before emptying into the Dalsfjorden at Osen near the village of Bygstad. The European route E39 highway crosses the river just east of the village of Sande.

It was established in 1933. Its clientele is primarily middle-class and upper-middle-class Bengali Hindus. It is currently administered by the third generation of the Kundu family. Origins It began its operations in 1933 when Sripati Charan Kundu, formerly from Bankura and at that time a resident of Kharagpur, reserved an entire train and undertook a 56-day all-India tour. He was the pioneer of tourism in India. The story goes that on that first tour the train made a stop at Sripati's native Bankura town, and many of the locals who could not afford to purchase a reservation on that tour, nevertheless wanted to be included in exchange for some of their material possessions like silverware! Among Sripati's many business interests most of which were related to the railways, this was the one where he concentrated his efforts and introduced many of his seven sons to the business. His fourth son, Phakir Chandra Kundu, and the youngest son Debdas Kundu later took charge of Kundu Special and established it in the hearts of Bengalis as the premier tour organisation with help from many of his other brothers. Many of the tours were on \\"special\\" trains, that were entire trains reserved by the company specially for its clients. These trains were not only staffed with chefs and bearers, but also had paid medical staff on board to help the two to three hundred passengers that would be part of such a tour. The quality of the food on Kundu Special tours have been standard and since Kundu Special provided quality Bengali food no matter where in India they were, it attracted the traditional food-loving Bengali in droves. The reputation of Kundu Special was built on the personal attention provided to every traveller. The brothers themselves accompanied many of the tours 'in the early days' and ensured the quality of the service. Currently, Kundu Special is under the able leadership of SankariPrasad kundu, sixth son of Lt. Sripati ch. Kundu,Soumitra Kundu, Mr. Netai Sengupta, Office Superintendend overviewing all about Kundu Special. The first office of Kundu Special was located at 40/1 Strand Road, an office amazingly still existing. In 1972, Phakir Kundu opened a new office at 1 Chittaranjan Avenue (now the main office) in a prime location in central Calcutta giving access to a much broader section of Calcutta society. That was also the year, Kundu Special organised tours to Europe for the first time. Phakir and one of his brothers, Sankar, themselves accompanied these tours to Europe and to the U.S.A. These 3-week all-inclusive tours, although not a part of the Kundu Special catalogue today, were a resouding success and introduced the Bengali to traveling in the West. Customer care From reserving a full train in the 1930s, the Kundus took to reserving entire bogies (train compartments) in the 1960s. They would carry mattresses known as \\"Dunlopillos\\" to fit within the train sleeping berths for comfort. Instead of checking into hotels (there weren‚Äôt that many quality ones in those days), the tourists would stay on in the bogie that would be stationed on the side tracks, somewhere in a railway station in India. The mornings would start with hot ghee-soaked luchis and dhonkar dalna along with a steaming cup of tea (luchi, a kind of fried puffed bread is a very popular Bengali delicacy). That would lead to khichudi-begun bhaja or bhaat-maacher jhol in the afternoon. At night, meat was a staple component of the meal unless of course the tour was one of the pilgrimages where vegetarian fare was de rigueur. A frequent traveller on Kundu Special was heard saying, Aar ki chai Dada, sakal-e luchi, raat-e luchi, e-to bari-teo hoy na! (What more do you want, luchi in the morning, luchi in the evening, we don't even get this at home.) The khichudi may have given way to fried rice in the 80s and to chow mein and biryani in the 21st Century, and the stationed bogie to hotel rooms, but even in the days of Cox and Kings and fancy packages and low- cost airfares, Kundu Special holds its own as a traditional Bengali bastion. At Kundu, each tourist group is still accompanied by two tour managers, two cooks and four bearers/waiters, all of whom are Bengali. Their primary responsibility remains to look after every need of the travellers. Tourist profile Kundu Special reports that 99 per cent of the tourists remain Bengali. Their social profile remains unchanged too: they come from the middle class and upper middle class. Many clients have been touring with them over generations. There are also the rich who often fly and put up at star hotels but join the group for sightseeing. Bengali single women and physically challenged people usually go on Kundu Special tours to avail of the comfort, safety and security. Itinerary Over the years, their itinerary has changed a bit. As it is no longer viable to have all-India tours, the tours have been broken into zone specific north India, south India, west India tours and so on. The most popular tours on Kundu Special were their comprehensive 2-week tours of Madhya pradesh, Bombay, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and Kashmir and their many pilgrimages to Kedar-Badri, Yamunetri- Gangotri, etc. These tours were particularly popular because in those days before the advent of good communications, it was almost impossible for most people to make arrangements to visit a number of places on the same trip. In addition to the above ever-popular tours, the Bengalis' love affair with the Himalayas was also exploited by the Kundus with tours to Simla, Naini Tal, Dalhousie, Kulu-Manali, etc. The duration of the trips has been considerably reduced over the years, now the most common ones bordering on 10- or 12-day vacations, which are shorter and more frequent. The Kundus have also added tours to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Leh Ladakh in the last two years. But they have dropped tours to Puri or Darjeeling, Sikkim which are traditional Bengali tourist haunts. The market demand for Kundu Special has gone really up in spite of online booking by various tour operators.

During the winter months the resort offers skiing, snowboarding, and snow tubing. The onsite hotel and lodge is open year-round and offers 114 rooms and multiple options for weddings and meetings. During the spring, summer, and fall the 18 hole Carroll Valley Golf Course at Liberty Mountain is open for a round of golf. Vail Resorts purchased Liberty Mountain from Peak Resorts, along with Peak's 16 other resorts, in 2019. History The resort was originally developed in the mid 1960s as a focal point for a major real estate development. The name of the ski mountain and the development was Charnita, named after Charles and Anita Rist, the developer and his wife. Charlie Rist hired Dick Brown, who had just designed the neighboring Ski Roundtop the year before, to develop and manage the Charnita ski area. After the Tri-County Citizens Committee efforts \\"to prevent the continued growth of the Charnita development\\" in 1970, the development suffered bankruptcy. Irv Naylor, the owner and founder of Snow Time, Inc. purchased the mountain in 1974 and renamed it Ski Liberty. It was renamed again in the late 1990s to Liberty Mountain Resort. In 2003, Snow Time, Inc added the Boulder Ridge Snow Tubing area. In May 2010 Liberty Mountain purchased The Carroll Valley Resort giving Liberty a total of 99 rooms as well as adding two more restaurants (The Tavern on the Green and The Inn) and an 18-hole golf course. In 2015, Liberty Mountain completed building the new Highland Lodge which brought their total number of hotel rooms up to 116, while adding state-of-the-art meeting and conference space, as well as replacing the two restaurants from Carroll Valley with Eagle & the Owl, a public house themed restaurant and Ike's Chophouse. Peak Resorts purchased the mountain in 2018 from Snow Time Inc., along with Snow Time's two other resorts, Whitetail Ski Resort and Roundtop Mountain Resort. Trails Liberty Mountain possesses slopes with varying levels of difficulty. The trail names are as follows: Easier Trails: Nova, Sneaky Pete, Dipsy Doodle, First Class Area, Lower Blue Streak, Snow Cat Alley More Difficult Trails: Adventure Alley, Upper Heavenly, Lower Heavenly, Whitney's Way, Lower Ultra, Lower Eastwind, Lower Strata, East Side, Sidewinder Most Difficult Trails: West Side Park, White Lightning, Upper Blue Streak Extremely Difficult Trails: Upper Ultra, Vertigo Park, Upper Eastwind, Upper Strata The Half Pipe at Liberty Mountain has since been removed as it was deemed too much work to maintain and cover with snow. The Half Pipe was usually only open for at most a month of the ski season, but some years not even open at all. The area where the Half Pipe was located was filled in and is now the East Side terrain park.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Southport from 1952 to 1959. Early life He was the first of six children born to Major Charles Hesketh Fleetwood-Hesketh (1871‚Äì1947) and his wife Anne Dorothea (Brocklebank) Fleetwood-Hesketh (1877‚Äì1940). His mother died in the torpedoing and sinking of the ocean liner SS City of Benares in September 1940. Hesketh was educated at Eton from where, in 1922, he was commissioned into the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry as a 2nd Lieutenant. He attended university at Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to bar in 1928 at the Middle Temple. Second World War During the Second World War, in February 1940, then at the rank of Major, he transferred to the Royal Artillery from the Yeomanry. As Lieutenant Colonel, Fleetwood-Hesketh was a member of Ops (B), the deception section of SHAEF that helped plan Operation Fortitude, a key portion of Operation Bodyguard, the deception plan covering the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. He wrote a history of his role and the operation that was published after his death. Following the end of the war, Hesketh was sent to Germany, alongside his brother, to search through the files of German intelligence, and question officers. He was then asked to write a history of deception in Western Europe, including the work up to and including Operation Fortitude. In the 1970s books about Second World War deception began to appear. Sefton Delmer's 1971 book, The Counterfeit Spy, appeared to be copied from Hesketh's earlier unpublished report. Noel Wild had provided Delmer with a copy of the report. Hesketh was annoyed and threatened to sue. However, the Government claimed Crown Copyright on his report and he was not able to. In the end Delmer added a credit to the second edition of the book, and Hesketh and other deceivers were able to correct inaccuracies. Hesketh's report was eventually published posthumously in 1999, with a foreword by \\"Nigel West\\" (the pseudonym of Rupert Allason). Political career Hesketh was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1947 and later Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1950 to 1972. He remained a reserve officer in the Territorial Army, with the honorary rank of Colonel, until 1957. In 1948, Hesketh was awarded an American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer). In 1970, he was appointed Officer (Civil Division) of the Order of the British Empire, at the time he was Chairman, Lancashire Agricultural Executive Committee. His name changed twice: the first time in 1907, when his father changed the family name from Bibby-Hesketh to Fleetwood-Hesketh, and on 10 August 1956, when he changed his name by deed poll to the unhyphenated form of Roger Fleetwood Hesketh. In the 1960s, Hesketh rebuilt the family home of Meols Hall, Southport (he had a hobbyist interest in architecture). He died in 1987.

Illumination from the Gospel Book. The Gospels of Henry the Lion were intended by Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, for the altar of the Virgin Mary in the church of St. Blaise's Abbey, Brunswick, better known as Brunswick Cathedral. The volume is considered a masterpiece of Romanesque book illumination of the 12th century. The gospel book was made for the duke on commission at the Benedictine Helmarshausen Abbey. As for its date, the church in Brunswick was built in 1173, and the altar of the Virgin Mary was dedicated in 1188. The creation of the gospel book was formerly placed by most authorities at about 1175 (\\"early dating\\") but today the balance of opinion puts it at about 1188 (\\"late dating\\"). The manuscript, containing 266 pages with the text of the four gospels, 50 of them full page illustrations, was sold by auction on 6 December 1983 at Sotheby's in London for ¬£8,140,000. The purchase price was raised, in the context of a German national initiative for the preservation of national treasures, by the German government, the Bundesl√§nder of Lower Saxony and Bavaria, the Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz and private donors (largely from Brunswick). It was the most expensive book in the world until 1994, when Bill Gates bought the Codex Leicester, a manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci.

Early life Henry Louis Wallace was born in Barnwell, South Carolina, son of Lottie Mae Wallace.]. Wallace grew up with his mother working long hours as a textile worker. She was a harsh disciplinarian, constantly criticizing her son for even the smallest mistakes. He attended Barnwell High School, where he was elected to student council and was a cheerleader. After he graduated in 1983, Wallace became a disc jockey for a Barnwell radio station. Wallace went to several colleges before joining the U.S. Navy in 1985. He married his high school sweetheart, the former Maretta Brabham, that same year. In 1992, Wallace was honorably discharged from the Navy. Early criminal career During his time in the Navy, he began using several drugs, including crack cocaine. In Washington, he was served warrants for several burglaries in and around the Seattle metro area. In January 1988, Wallace was arrested for breaking into a hardware store. That June, he pled guilty to second-degree burglary. A judge sentenced him to two years of supervised probation. According to Probation Officer Patrick Seaburg, Wallace did not show up for most mandatory meetings. Murders On March 8, 1990, he murdered Tashonda Bethea, a Barnwell High School student. He then dumped her body in a lake in his hometown. It was not until several weeks later that her body was discovered. He was questioned by the police regarding her disappearance and death, but was never formally charged in her murder. He was also questioned in connection with the attempted rape of a 16-year-old Barnwell girl, but was never charged for that either. By that time, his marriage had fallen apart, and he was fired from his job as Chemical Operator for Sandoz Chemical Co. In February 1991, he broke into his old high school and the radio station where he once worked. He stole video and recording equipment and was caught trying to pawn them. In November 1991, he relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. He found jobs at several fast-food restaurants in East Charlotte. In May 1992, he picked up Sharon Nance, a convicted drug dealer and prostitute. When she demanded payment for her services, Wallace beat her to death, then dropped her body by the railroad tracks. She was found a few days later. In June 1992, he raped and strangled Caroline Love at her apartment, then dumped her body in a wooded area. Love was a friend of Wallace's girlfriend.. She worked at Bojangles at the time of the disappearance. After he killed her, he and her sister filed a missing person's report at the police station. It would be almost two years (March 1994) before her body was discovered in a wooded area in Charlotte. On February 19, 1993, Wallace strangled Shawna Hawk at her home after first having sex with her, and later went to her funeral. Hawk worked at Taco Bell where Wallace was her supervisor. In March 1993, Hawk's mother, Dee Sumpter, and her godmother Judy Williams founded Mothers of Murdered Offspring, a Charlotte-based support group for parents of murdered children. On June 22, he raped and strangled coworker Audrey Spain. Her body was found two days later. On August 10, 1993, Wallace raped and strangled Valencia M. Jumper, 21 year old college student from Columbia, S.C. -- a friend of his sister -- then set her on fire to cover up his crime. A few days after her murder, he and his sister went to Valencia's funeral, even sending her family condolences. A month later, in September 1993, he went to the apartment of Michelle Stinson, a struggling college student and single mother of two sons. Stinson was a friend of his from Taco Bell. He raped her and then some time later strangled and stabbed her in front of her oldest son. That October, his only child was born. On February 4, 1994 Wallace was arrested for shoplifting, but police had not made a connection between him and the murders. On February 20, 1994, Wallace raped and strangled Vanessa Little Mack in her apartment. He knew her through her sister, who was a co-worker of Henry at Taco Bell. Mack had two daughters, aged seven and four months, at the time of her death. On March 8, 1994, Wallace robbed, raped, and strangled Betty Jean Baucom. Baucom and Wallace's girlfriend were co-workers. She was living in Charlotte for at least six months with her three year old daughter. She was originally from Laurel Hill, N.C. After he murdered her, he took valuables from the house, then left the apartment with her car. He pawned everything except the car, which he left at a local shopping center across the street from the Lake Apartments. Wallace went back to the same apartment complex on the night of March 8, 1994, knowing that Berness Woods would be at work so he could murder his girlfriend, Brandi June Henderson. Ms. Henderson was a student and a homemaker taking care of her infant son. They lived at The Lake Apartments for one month after moving there in February 1994. Wallace raped Henderson while she held her baby, and then strangled her. He also strangled her son, but he survived. Afterwards, he took some valuables from the apartment and left. The police increased their patrols in East Charlotte after two bodies of young black women were found at The Lake apartment complex. Even so, Wallace sneaked through to rob and strangle Debra Ann Slaughter, who had been a co-worker of his girlfriend, and stabbed her some 38 times in the stomach and chest. Her body was found on March 12, 1994. Wallace was arrested on March 13, 1994. For 12 hours, he confessed to the murders of 10 women in Charlotte. He then confessed to an 11th murder he committed before moving to Charlotte. He described in detail, the women's appearances, how he raped, robbed and killed the women, and his crack habit. Aftermath and criticism Charlotte's police chief congratulated Wallace's arrest, reassuring the community that the women of East Charlotte were safe. However, many in the area's black community criticized the police's conduct during the investigation, accusing them of neglecting the murders of black women. One woman stated that the police did not care because they viewed the young female murder victims as \\"fast girls who hang out a lot\\". As Shawna Denise Hawk's mother, Dee Sumpter, said: : \\"The victims weren't prominent people with social-economic status. They weren't special. And they were black.\\" Charlotte's police chief, Dennis Nowicki, had said he was not aware of a killer until early March 1994, when three young black women were murdered within four days of each other. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Police Department apologized to its residents for not spotting a link among the murders sooner. However, they said the murder cases varied enough to throw them off Wallace's trail. Until Wallace's murder pace picked up in the early weeks of March 1994, the deaths were sporadic and not entirely similar. It was only in the week of March 9, 1994 that Charlotte Police warned the people in East Charlotte that there was a serial killer on the loose.  Trial  Over the next two years, Wallace's trial was delayed over choice of venue, DNA evidence from murdered victims, and jury selection. His trial began in September 1996. In the opening arguments, prosecutor Marsha Goodnow argued for the death penalty, while defense attorney Isabel Day asked for a life sentence, arguing that Wallace suffered from mental illness, and that the killings were not first-degree murder because they did not result from \\"premeditation and deliberation\\". According to FBI serial murder expert Robert Ressler: : \\"If he elected to become a serial killer, he was going about it in the wrong way... Mr. Wallace always seemed to take one step forward and two steps back. He would take items and put them in the stove to destroy them by burning them and then forget to turn the stove on.\\" In 1994 police had asked the FBI for assistance, but the FBI said that the murders were not the work of a serial killer. Psychologist Faye Sultan testified during the trial that Wallace was a constant victim of physical and mental abuse from his mother since birth and that he suffered from mental illness at the time of the killings. Sultan argued for a life sentence without parole instead of the death penalty. On January 7, 1997, Wallace was found guilty of nine murders. On January 29, he was sentenced to nine death sentences. Following his sentencing, Wallace made a statement to his victims' families. : \\"None of these women, none of your daughters, mothers, sisters or family members in any way deserved what they got. They did nothing to me that warranted their death.\\" On death row On June 5, 1998, Wallace married a former prison nurse, Rebecca Torrijas, in a ceremony next to the execution chamber where he has been sentenced to die. Mecklenburg County public defender Isabel Day served as an official witness and photographer. Also attending was the manager of the Death Row unit at the prison. Since being sentenced to death in 1997, Wallace has been appealing to the courts to overturn the death sentences, stating that his confessions were coerced and his constitutional rights were violated in the process. The North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the death sentences in 2000. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2001 denied his appeal. In 2005, Superior Court Judge Charles Lamm rejected Wallace's latest appeal to overturn his convictions and nine death sentences.

He and his brother were created Margraves of Neustria by Charles the Bald in 861. He was possibly a Conradine, a relative for sure of Adalard the Seneschal, a Girardid. Berengar was probably the namesake of Berengar II of Neustria, who was probably the son of Berengar I's successor, Henry of Franconia. He is believed to be the same person as B√©renger I, Count of Ivois. With his brothers, Udo and Waldo the Abbot, he took part in the 861 revolt of Carloman of Bavaria, possible his cousin-in-law, against Louis the German. The revolt was crushed and the three brothers fled with their relative Adalard to the court of the West Frankish king, Charles the Bald, who granted them wardship of the march against the Vikings while the march against the Bretons was granted to Robert the Strong. Charles' patronage of the family provoked the jealousy of the Rorgonids, the most powerful family local to Neustria and then controlling the ducatus Cenomannicus (Maine). In 865, they allied with Saloman of Brittany and attacked the brothers. Charles, to attain peace, took the march back and gave it to Gauzfrid, a Rorgonid. A charter of 879 mentions Berengar and his brothers taking part in the foundation of the college of Gem√ºnden. Evidently, the death of Louis the German in 876 had allowed them to return to the court of Carloman. His daughter Ota became wife of Arnulf of Carinthia.

The Sino-Japanese War was the beginning of World War II in Asia, and following the Battles of Shanghai and Nanjing, the Chinese Central Air Force Academy had to be relocated from Jianqiao Airbase to the expanded Wujiaba Airport.http://www.12371.cn/2015/10/21/ARTI1445407661523198.shtml After a few years of support of the Chinese Air Force under the Sino-Soviet Cooperation in the War of Resistance against the Empire of Japan, the United States began to show earnest support for China's war effort with the oil embargo and asset freezing against Japan in 1941,https://www.history.com/this-day-in- history/united-states-freezes-japanese-assets and Wujiaba became the base for the \\"legendary Flying Tigers\\", the American Volunteer Group (AVG) of combat airmen serving in the Chinese Air Force, led by Claire Lee Chennault just before the United States entered the war.

Even though it had no significant impact on the final outcome of the war, the capture of certain South Vietnamese-held Spratly Islands (') in the South China Sea (referred to by the Vietnamese as the East Sea), and other islands on the southeastern coast of Vietnam by the Vietnam People's Navy (VPN) and the Viet Cong (VC) helped the Socialist Republic of Vietnam assert its sovereignty over the various groups of islands after the reunification of the country in 1975. The North Vietnamese objective was to capture all the islands under the occupation of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), and it eventually ended in complete victory for the North Vietnamese. Background In 1975, as units of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) were pushing toward Saigon as part of the 1975 Spring Offensive, the North Vietnamese High Command decided to capture all South Vietnamese-occupied islands located on the southeastern coast of Vietnam, and in the South China Sea. Subsequently, different units of the VPN were deployed to coordinate their forces with local VC units in South Vietnam to take the Spratlys and other territories.Pham & Khang, pp. 347‚Äì347. During the 1970s the Spratly islands was already a source of dispute for many countries in the region; Malaysia, the People's Republic of China (Communist China), the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Philippines and South Vietnam all claimed sovereignty over all or parts of the islands. In early 1975 the underlying tension between the claimants came to the surface when South Vietnam invaded Southwest Cay, then occupied by the military forces of its wartime ally, the Philippines. In order to lure the Philippines soldiers off Southwest Cay, it was reported that South Vietnamese authorities sent prostitutes to the birthday party of the Philippine military commander on another island.Dinh, p. 150.Kenny, p.66. While the Philippine soldiers left their post to attend the birthday party of their commanding officer, South Vietnamese soldiers moved in to occupy Southwest Cay. After the Philippines military realized they had lost their territory, they planned to retake the island from the South Vietnamese through military force. By the time the Philippines military were able to put their plan into action, the South Vietnamese had already built a strong defense on Southwest Cay, thus deterring any potential counter-attack. Later Southwest Cay would be the first major target for the VPN. Prelude =North Vietnam= On April 4, 1975, the High Command of the VPN and the Command of Military Region 5, under the command of General Chu Huy M√¢n, agreed on a plan to seize some Spratlys and other groups of islands. Under their secret plan, the VPN deployed the 126th Battalion, a naval special forces unit of about 170 personnel, to join the VC 471st Battalion of Military Zone 5. They were supported by three transport ships, the T673, T674 and T675 along with 60 experienced sailors and technicians from the 125th Naval Transport Brigade. The operation would commence at 12.00 am on April 9, 1975, to coincide with the PAVN ground attack on Xu√¢n L·ªôc and to take advantage of low tide to land the special forces on the South Vietnamese- occupied sections of the Spratly Islands. To maintain the secrecy of their operation, the VPN kept their radio communications to a minimum in the days leading up to the attack. =South Vietnam= Unlike their North Vietnamese counterparts, South Vietnam possessed a large naval force with a strong fleet of ships. Hence the Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVN), commanded by Vice Admiral Chung T·∫•n Cang, were able to maintain a strong presence in the Spratly Islands, with only a handful of infantry units provided by the ARVN to protect the smaller islands surrounding the main Spratly Island. To defend the islands, ARVN forces were mainly equipped with small infantry weapons, as well as the M-72 anti-tank weapon. Whenever necessary, the RVN could deploy the destroyer , the frigates , and , as well as the corvettes and to provide fire support. The RVN also relied on two transport ships, namely the and , to transport vital supplies and reinforcements to ARVN forces on the Spratly Islands.Dinh, pp. 352‚Äì355. Battle =Southwest Cay= On April 9, 1975, three VPN transport ships, disguised as fishing trawlers, began moving towards Southwest Cay in the Spratly Islands with members of the 126th and 471st Battalions all on board. On the morning of April 11, 1975, helicopters from the United States Seventh Fleet began circling the VPN transport ships, but they were allowed to move on as the disguised North Vietnamese ‚Äòfishing trawlers‚Äô were mistakenly identified as ships from Hong Kong. After the American helicopters flew away, the North Vietnamese continued sailing towards Southwest Cay. On the night of April 13, the three ships were closing in on Southwest Cay from three different directions. During the early hours of April 13, 1975, personnel from the VPN 126th Battalion and the VC 471st Battalion landed on Southwest Cay using rubber boats.Navy High Command, p. 313. Taken by complete surprise, the ARVN on Southwest Cay put up stiff resistance, but they surrendered to the VPN/VC after 30 minutes of fighting. The VPN/VC claimed to have killed 6 ARVN in action, and taken 33 prisoners.Dinh, p. 162. In response to the attack on Southwest Cay, the RVN immediately formed a task force which came in the form of the frigate RVNS L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and the HQ-402 transport ship to retaliate, but both ships were forced to turn back and defend Namyit Island instead. Having achieved their initial objective, the VPN command sent out the transport ship T641, to carry all the captured ARVN soldiers back to Da Nang. With Southwest Cay firmly in their hands, the VPN command set their sights on the next three targets: Namyit, Sin Cowe and Sand Cay.Thayer & Amer, p. 69. =Sand Cay= The VPN, however, were deterred from attacking Namyit Island because they had lost the element of surprise, as well as the strong presence of several RVN frigates surrounding that island. So, instead of attacking Namyit, the VPN selected Sand Cay as their next target. On the night of April 24, under the observation of the Taiwanese military, VPN transport ships sailed in a single column passed the Taiwanese-occupied island of Itu Aba towards their next objective.Dinh, p. 153. Again, following the same pattern of operation, the ships anchored near Sand Cay and prepared for their assault. At 1.30 am on April 25, 1975, three platoons from the 126th Battalion successfully landed on Sand Cay. One hour later, they opened their attack and the ARVN were easily defeated, suffering 2 deaths and 23 captured. The loss of Southwest Cay and Sand Cay, in combination with the defeats suffered by the ARVN on the mainland, placed the RVN in a complex and difficult position. As a result, at 8.45 pm on April 26, 1975, RVN ships in the Spratly Island area were ordered to evacuate the ARVN 371st Local Battalion and withdraw from Namyit and Sin Cowe.Dinh, p. 155. While the RVN were preparing to withdraw from Spratly Island, VPN reconnaissance units sent reports back to Hanoi, informing the naval command of RVN ships leaving their positions in Namyit and Sin Cowe. Upon hearing the news of the South Vietnamese withdrawal, the VPN command ordered the 126th Battalion to capture the remaining islands. On April 27 and 28, the PAVN 126th Battalion marched onto Namyit and Sin Cowe without opposition. On April 29, 1975, the VPN had successfully completed their mission in capturing all of the islands of the Spratly group that had been held by South Vietnam. =Ph√∫ Qu√Ω Island= Ph√∫ Qu√Ω island, also known as Cu Lao Thu, is located off the coast of southern Vietnam. The island is about away from Phan Thi·∫øt, and away from Cam Ranh Bay. The island is about 21 square kilometers in size, and in 1975 it had a population of about 12,000 people. At the end of March 1975, the ARVN maintained a security team on Ph√∫ Qu√Ω, which included one police platoon and 4,000 members of the People's Self- Defense Forces. From April 1975, the local ARVN forces on Ph√∫ Qu√Ω were joined by an additional 800 ARVN soldiers, who escaped from the mainland town of H√†m T√¢n when PAVN forces captured it.Navy High Command, p. 320. On April 22, the RVN deployed the HQ-11 corvette and one small patrol boat to defend the island from VPN attack. On April 26, 1975, the PAVN South Central Coast Command at Cam Ranh Base and the 125th Naval Transport Brigade of the VPN began transporting members of the 407th Special Forces Battalion from Military Region 5, and elements of the 95th Regiment towards Ph√∫ Qu√Ω. At 1.50 am on April 27, 1975, the VPN/PAVN landed on the island and the fight for Ph√∫ Qu√Ω Island began. Caught by surprise South Vietnamese units retreated to the administrative center of the island, where they organized their defenses in an attempt to push back the North Vietnamese forces. While at sea, the RVN's HQ-11 escort ship clashed with boats from the VPN 125th Navy Transport Brigate, but ultimately the long-range artillery used by the VPN proved too much for the HQ-11 and it retreated from the island with significant damage. After several hours of waiting, the commander of the HQ-11 decided to pull anchor and escaped to the Philippines when further reinforcements from the RVN failed to arrive. At 6.30 am remnants of the ARVN gave up and ended their resistance. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 382 ARVN prisoners, and collected more than 900 weapons of various kinds.Dinh, p. 168.Farrell, p. 66. =C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Archipelago= C√¥n ƒê·∫£o archipelago is located in the southwestern area of the South China Sea, nearly from the city of V≈©ng T√†u. C√¥n S∆°n Island is the largest island with an area of 52 square kilometers, accounting for about 75% of the entire C√¥n ƒê·∫£o archipelago. C√¥n S∆°n is the largest township on the island and was also the seat of the local government. By the end of the war, about 7,000 political and military prisoners, of whom 500 were female, were imprisoned at C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Prison. On April 29, 1975, the airfield at C√¥n S∆°n became a staging post where South Vietnamese government officials and U.S. advisers were assembled, to be evacuated to the U.S. warships of the 7th Fleet which anchored nearby. During the last days of the war, about 2,000 ARVN soldiers were defending the island.The Encyclopedia of Vietnam, p. 557.Pham, p. 366. During the early hours of May 1, 1975, all the political prisoners at Prison VII staged an uprising and they quickly overpowered what was left of the South Vietnamese prison authorities. They set up a Provisional Committee to govern the island, and organised three platoon- sized units using captured weapons to march on the remnants of the ARVN. The political prisoners attacked the ARVN barracks at B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Vuong, Camp IV and Camp V. The ARVN chose to run away instead of fighting back, whilst leaving large quantities of weapons and ammunition behind. Encouraged by the news of South Vietnam's capitulation, the prisoners continued their march towards the local police station which had already been abandoned by the South Vietnamese. By 8 am the prisoners had captured all former South Vietnamese infrastructure and assets, including 27 aircraft, as the remaining ARVN soldiers at the C√¥n S∆°n airport also surrendered.Pham & Khang, pp. 357‚Äì358. On the evening of May 2, 1975, the rebel prisoners on C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Island successfully establish communications with North Vietnamese military units. To prepare for the arrival of the North Vietnamese, the Provisional Committee moved to set up a trench system around the island to defend against a possible South Vietnamese or U.S. counter-attack. On the morning of May 5, 1975, the VPN 171st and 172nd Naval Regiments landed on C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Island with elements of the PAVN 3rd Division. Throughout the day regular North Vietnamese military units and the rebel prisoners coordinated their forces, to establish control over the rest of the C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Archipelago.Navy High Command, p. 322. Aftermath After more than two months of planning and combat operations, the VPN successfully captured the Spratly, Ph√∫ Qu√Ω and C√¥n ƒê·∫£o groups of islands from the South Vietnamese. In the days following their victory the North Vietnamese also went on to raise their flag over the smaller cays and reefs of An Bang (Amboyna Cay), Sin Cowe East and Pearson Reef (Hon Sap). In 1976, following the unification of Vietnam, some Spratly islands became a part of Kh√°nh H√≤a Province.Phan, p.19. To assert Vietnam's political sovereignty, the North Vietnamese military initially deployed four battalions of the 2nd Division from Military Region 5 to defend the islands. In September 1975 the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense transferred the 46th Infantry Regiment from the PAVN 325th Division to the VPN, to form a brigade with the 126th Naval Regiment with the purpose of defending the Spratlys and other groups of islands. Following the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976, additional units were transferred to 126th Naval Infantry Brigade to bolster the defenses of Vietnam's outlying islands.Quy, p.17.

He was a man of vision. It was during his time Malankara church opened the first formal educational institution, in Kerala. With the opening of Kottayam Suryani Seminary, modern education dawned in Kerala.  Consecration  While Mar Thoma VII was at Kandanad (near Kochi) he fell seriously ill. He did not get time to call a meeting of the church leaders to select his successor. So he invited one of his relatives Thoma Kathanar, to his bed side, laid his hands on him, prayed and consecrated him as Mar Thoma VIII on 2 July 1809. Two days later, on 4 July, Mar Thoma VII died and Mar Thoma VIII took charge of the Malankara church. Meeting of the church leaders It was necessary for him to get the approval of the people to be a Malankara Metropolitan. For this reason soon after becoming Malankara Metropolitan, he convened a meeting of the representatives of the parishes at Kandanad, on 14 September 1809. In that meeting they, #Unanimously accepted Mar Thoma VIII as Malankara Metropolitan and presented him with the insignia, a ring. #Selected Kayamkulam philipose ramban from Kayamkulam and Pulikottil Ittoop Ramban from Kunnamkulam as advisers to the Metropolitan. #Agreed to use the interest received from Vattipanam, for opening of a Seminary. #Accepted a written constitution for the church.

Vattipanam (Fixed deposit) For Malankara church, Mar Thoma VII, on 1 December 1808 deposited as loan in perpetuity a sum of 3000 Poovarahan with the government of Travancore through Col. Maccaulay the British resident. The first instalment of interest was due on 1 December 1809. It was paid to Mar Thoma VIII. But there were complaints that the interest was not used for opening the seminary. In 1814 instead of giving this amount to the Malankara Metropolitan Mar Thoma VIII, the British resident Major Munroe handed over the amount (Rs. 3360) to Ramban Ittoop of Pulikottil. Giving the interest to someone who was not the Metropolitan angered the Governor of Madras also, who reprimanded Major Munroe. So in 1815 Ittoop Ramban received consecration as Metropolitan with the title of Pulikkottil Mar Dionysius from Mar Philexinos of Thozhyoor. Mar Thoma VIII complained to the resident but no action was taken.Niranam Granthavari (Record of History written during 1770‚Äì1830).

First education institution in Kerala =Seminary= Leaders of the church decided to have the Seminary at Kottayam, now Orthodox Pazhaya Seminary. The government of Travancore provided tax free land and the foundation stone was laid in February 1813. The work went on very fast and classes began in March 1815. Qualified teachers to teach various subjects were also appointed. They were Maramon Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan (Syriac), Konattu Varghese Malpan (Syriac), Kozhikode Kunjan Assan (Sanskrit), Poet Laureate Chekottu Kuruvilla Assan (Malayalam) and from Kochi Mose Esarphathi (Hebrew & Greek) were the first teachers of this first education institution in Kerala. By 2000 Kerala became the most literate state in India.Mathew, N. M. Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1, p. 241. Last days The actions and decisions of Major Munroe was a great blow to Mar Thoma VIII. Because of all these he fell sick and was bed ridden. For a better treatment he left Ankamali for Niranam. Knowing that his end was nearing, he called his uncle Kadamattathu, Iype Kathanar to his bedside, laid his hands on him, and consecrated him as his successor, Mar Thoma IX. Though at Niranam he was given great care and better treatment, Mar Thoma VIII died on 26 January 1816 and was interred at St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral, Puthencavu. The funeral service was conducted by his successor Mar Thoma IX.

Its athletic team name is the Generals. History Jackson High School began as a grade school. The original building was a log cabin built in 1898 on land donated by L.J. Becker. In its first year there were only 14 students. It was replaced by a four-room grade school which was more than doubled later with the addition of a five-room annex. Due to the growth of Miami's northwestern section, more rooms had to be added. In 1926, a three-story high school building was added. This building remained the Jackson High School main campus until 2008, when a new campus was built on the school's athletic fields; the original building was demolished and its area used for the new athletic fields. Jackson's renovation was a part of a program to rebuild all high schools in Miami-Dade County, and was the second school to be rebuilt after Miami Beach High School. The former building was the third-oldest high school building in Miami-Dade County, Florida after Beach High and the historical campus at Miami High School. The tenth grade was added in 1936, and by 1939 the eleventh and twelfth grades were added. By then, the elementary grades had been dropped. Jackson's first graduating class had 79 students.

Dalrymple-White was the son of General Sir Henry Dalrymple White and his second wife Alice Elizabeth (n√©e Malcolm), and was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Grenadier Guards and was promoted to lieutenant on 7 February 1885, and captain on 13 February 1897. When the Second Boer War broke out in South Africa he went there with a battalion of his regiment in 1900, and took part in operations in the Transvaal, east of Pretoria, July‚ÄìNovember 1900, including the battle of Belfast. In November 1900 he was present at the actions near Caledon River; then served in Orange River Colony and Cape Colony from December 1900 to May 1902. Following the end of hostilities, he left Cape Town in late June 1902 on board the SS City of Vienna, arriving at Southampton the following month. For his service during the war, he had been promoted to major on 23 July 1901, was mentioned in despatches, and received the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps, and the King's South Africa Medal with two clasps. After the war he served as Station Commandant. He later served in the First World War and achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Grenadier Guards. Dalrymple-White was also involved in politics and sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southport from January 1910 to 1923 and from 1924 to 1931. In 1926 he assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Dalrymple and the same year he was created a baronet, of High Mark in the County of Wigtown. Dalrymple-White married, in 1912, the Hon. Catherine Mary, daughter of Byron Cary, 12th Viscount of Falkland. He died in April 1954, aged 87, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Henry.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It has high structural and functional similarity to FK506-binding protein 1A (FKBP1A), but unlike FKBP1A, this protein does not have immunosuppressant activity when complexed with FK506. It interacts with interferon regulatory factor-4 and plays an important role in immunoregulatory gene expression in B and T lymphocytes. This encoded protein is known to associate with phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase. It can also associate with two heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hsp70) and thus may play a role in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of the steroid hormone receptors. This protein correlates strongly with adeno-associated virus type 2 vectors (AAV) resulting in a significant increase in AAV-mediated transgene expression in human cell lines. Thus this encoded protein is thought to have important implications for the optimal use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy.  Structure  This protein contains TPR repeats and has a PPlase domain.  Clinical significance  Recent research suggests that FKBP52 may play a role in preventing the Tau protein from turning pathogenic. This may prove significant for the development of new Alzheimer's drugs and for detecting the disease before the onset of clinical symptoms.  Interactions  FKBP52 has been shown to interact with GLMN.

It was founded in 1977 by Reinhard Mohn as the result of social, corporate and fiscal considerations. As the Bertelsmann Stiftung itself has put it, the foundation promotes \\"reform processes\\" and \\"the principles of entrepreneurial activity\\" to build a \\"future-oriented society.\\" Since 1993, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has held the majority of capital shares in the Bertelsmann Group. It holds 80.9% together with the Reinhard Mohn Stiftung and the BVG Stiftung but has no voting rights.  History  Reinhard Mohn (2008) = Establishment of the foundation = At the end of the 1970s, there were discussions concerning who would follow Reinhard Mohn as chairman of Bertelsmann. Against this background and because he believed that the state must be able to count on its citizens' willingness to assume responsibility and take the initiative, Mohn founded the Bertelsmann Stiftung on February 8, 1977. It was officially approved by the authorities on March 14, 1977. The Bertelsmann Stiftung was initially endowed with 100,000 Deutsche Marks in capital. About two years later it began its work. = Building the foundation's work = In 1979, Hans-Dieter Weger was appointed the first managing director. He developed the concept of an operational foundation that develops and oversees its own projects. One of the Bertelsmann Stiftung's first activities was the baseline study \\"Kommunikationsverhalten und Buch\\" (Communication Behavior and the Book), which was prepared in cooperation with Infratest. The Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Bertelsmann Group also provided support for the construction of the G√ºtersloh municipal library. In 1982, the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented its first public report of its activities. In the report's foreword, Karl Carstens, president of the Federal Republic of Germany, praised the \\"achievement of foundations in the public sphere.\\" In the meantime, the Bertelsmann Stiftung had come to play a central role in Reinhard Mohn's sociopolitical activities. Mohn functioned as the foundation's sole executive and was supported by a newly created advisory board from 1983 onwards. In addition to Reinhard Mohn and Hans-Dieter Weger, the board's members were Kurt Biedenkopf, Gerd Bucerius, Friedhelm Farthmann and Eberhard Witte. In 1985, a publishing house was founded as part of the foundation in order to handle the growing number of publications. Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung still exists today. In 1988, the Bertelsmann Stiftung awarded the Carl Bertelsmann Prize (now known as the Reinhard Mohn Prize) for the first time. The recipients were employer organizations and trade unions in the construction, chemistry and metalworking industries. Today, the award continues to honor internationally renowned figures who have developed pioneering solutions to social and political challenges. In addition to working in Germany, the Bertelsmann Stiftung initiated several international projects in the 1980s, such as the \\"Kulturraum Europa\\" (European Culture Space). Further examples include a program at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the construction of the Biblioteca Can Torr√≥ in Alc√∫dia on the island of Majorca. Mikhail Gorbachev, Reinhard Mohn and Liz Mohn in the foyer of the Bertelsmann Stiftung (1992) Kurt Biedenkopf was elected as the first chairman of the advisory board in 1987, and Reinhard Mohn himself took over this position in 1990. Horst Teltschik then joined the foundation, a development that received a great deal of media attention. The former foreign policy adviser to Helmut Kohl became managing director of the Bertelsmann Stiftung in early 1991 and began focusing on the foundation's internationalization. At the end of the 1980s, the Bertelsmann Stiftung offices were built opposite the Bertelsmann corporate headquarters. Mikhail Gorbachev was a guest during his first trip to Germany after the demise of the Soviet Union. = Transferring the majority interest = In addition to Reinhard Mohn, Ulrich Saxer and Werner Weidenfeld were appointed to the Bertelsmann Stiftung executive board in 1993. New management was also hired. In the same year, Reinhard Mohn transferred the majority of the capital shares in the Bertelsmann Group to the foundation, a move intended to ensure continuity at the company. The transaction increased the foundation's stake in the company from 21.3% to 68.8%, being the largest shareholder. In the 1993 transfer agreement, however, shareholdings and voting rights were strictly separated, so that the foundation cannot exercise any significant influence on the Bertelsmann Group, which is still largely controlled by the Mohn family. As the foundation receives dividends for its holdings in the company, the transfer of shares resulted in a significant increase in the organization's budget. = Restructuring of governance boards = In 1998, Reinhard Mohn stepped down from his leading role at the Bertelsmann Stiftung. Mark W√∂ssner was first elected chairman of the executive board, and, a year later, chairman of the advisory board. After W√∂ssner's departure in 2000, the foundation's governance structure changed again: the executive board was replaced by an executive committee and the advisory board was replaced by a board of trustees. As an interim step, at the end of 2000 Reinhard Mohn became chairman of both the executive committee and the board of trustees, until Gunter Thielen succeeded him in both positions in mid-2001. With this step, Reinhard Mohn gave up all previous management functions, remaining only a member of the board of trustees. succeeded Gunter Thielen in 2002 and continued to lead the Bertelsmann Stiftung until 2005. During his tenure, the executive committee became an executive board once again; the goal was to strengthen corporate governance by promoting greater transparency and independence. After Meffert left the foundation, it was jointly led by board chairs Liz Mohn and Johannes Meier. In 2008, Gunter Thielen returned to the Bertelsmann Stiftung as chairman of the executive board. Since 2012, the foundation has been led by Aart De Geus, former Dutch minister of labor and social affairs. Following his retirement at the end of 2019, Ralph Heck took over as chairman of the executive board in mid-2020.  Organization  The Bertelsmann Stiftung is an independent foundation under private law, according to the laws governing foundations in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is an unrestricted legal entity, which, internally and externally, must exclusively pursue the mission defined in its bylaws. The Bertelsmann Stiftung is overseen by the district government of Detmold and engages in tax-privileged activities exclusively and directly in accordance with the relevant tax regulations. = Boards = The Bertelsmann Stiftung's managerial and representative bodies report to the executive Board, which, according to the foundation's bylaws, consists of at least three members who are appointed and removed by the board of trustees. The executive board develops the Bertelsmann Stiftung's organizational strategy, coordinates it with the board of trustees and oversees its implementation. Members of the executive board who are also members of the executive board of Bertelsmann Management SE can only represent the foundation in collaboration with a second board member who does not belong to the executive board of Bertelsmann Management SE, which is the Bertelsmann Group's management unit. At present, the Bertelsmann Stiftung executive board consists of Ralph Heck (chairman), Liz Mohn (vice-chairwoman), Brigitte Mohn and J√∂rg Dr√§ger. The executive board is advised and supervised by the Bertelsmann Stiftung board of trustees. This is involved in all decisions of fundamental importance. Its tasks also include approving the annual financial statements, overseeing the foundation's business management and formally accepting and approving the executive board's statement of activities. According to the bylaws, the board of trustees has at least six and a maximum of 14 members. These include the chairman or another member of the supervisory board of the Bertelsmann Group; a successor to Bertelsmann Stiftung founder Reinhard Mohn; Liz Mohn; and three to 11 other persons. The Bertelsmann Stiftung board of trustees currently includes Werner J. Bauer (chairman), Liz Mohn (vice-chairwoman), Dominik Asam, Wolf Bauer, Carsten Coesfeld, Thomas Buberl, Ulrike Detmers, Wolfgang A. Herrmann, Christoph Mohn, Carolina M√ºller- M√∂hl, Viviane Reding, Philipp R√∂sler, and J√ºrgen Stark. = Funding = The Bertelsmann Stiftung is funded primarily by dividends from the Bertelsmann Group. In the 2019 financial year, funding from this source totaled ‚Ç¨130.0 million, or 96% of the revenues. The Bertelsmann Stiftung holds its shares in the Bertelsmann Group indirectly through Johannes Mohn GmbH, in which it holds a majority interest. The foundation's Bertelsmann Group shares are solely capital shares; voting rights are held by the Bertelsmann Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH. Additional funding comes from partnerships with other non-profit organizations, income from the foundation's assets and donations. The Bertelsmann Stiftung sets aside reserves as required by the relevant tax regulations in order to pursue its activities independently of current income. In the 2019 financial year, these reserves amounted to ‚Ç¨534 million. Since its establishment, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has invested a total of ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in charitable work. In the 2019 financial year, expenditures amounted to around ‚Ç¨90.5 million. The majority (‚Ç¨51.9 million) was spent on programs and special projects; ‚Ç¨11.7 million were spent on administrative activities, ‚Ç¨8.6 million on communication and ‚Ç¨4.7 million on project-related services. In addition, the Bertelsmann Stiftung made grants to affiliated non-profit organizations in the amount of ‚Ç¨13.6 million. = Locations = Reichsbank branch in G√ºtersloh (historical postcard motif) The first offices of the Bertelsmann Stiftung were located in a residential building on G√ºtersloh's Carl-Miele-Stra√üe. In 1980, offices were rented from the Bertelsmann Group instead. In 1986, the Bertelsmann Stiftung moved to a historic building on Moltkestra√üe, which had been erected by a subsidiary of the Reichsbank in 1893 and was owned by the central bank of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia until 1985. In 1989, the architecture firm Gerkan, Marg and Partners won a competition to design the new headquarters of the Bertelsmann Stiftung opposite the headquarters of the Bertelsmann Group. The building was completed in 1990 and expanded several times over the following years. In addition to the head office in G√ºtersloh, the Bertelsmann Group has an office in the Kommandantenhaus in Berlin, which has been used by the Bertelsmann Stiftung, too. It now has its own branch office on Werderschen Markt in the immediate vicinity of the Federal Foreign Office and the Humboldt Forum. Furthermore, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has an office in the European Quarter in Brussels. In the mid-1990s, the Fundaci√≥n Bertelsmann, an independent subsidiary foundation, was established in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia. The aim was to promote reading and media literacy in Spain. Today, the Fundaci√≥n Bertelsmann focuses on vocational training and career guidance for young people in Spain. Since 2008, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has also been represented in US-capital Washington, D.C, by a second independent foundation, the Bertelsmann Foundation North America, which addresses challenges relating to transatlantic partnerships.  Activities  According to its bylaws, the purpose of the Bertelsmann Stiftung is to \\"promote science and research, religion, public health, youth and elderly welfare, art and culture, public and professional education, social welfare, an international perspective, democracy and social engagement.\\" The Bertelsmann Stiftung is a private operating foundation and does not make grants. It invests funds in projects that it conceives, initiates and implements itself. For example, the Bertelsmann Stiftung produces studies and rankings, conducts model projects, shares knowledge and expertise, organizes congresses and awards prizes. Key fields are education, democracy, social affairs, health, the economy and culture. The Bertelsmann Stiftung does not engage in partisan politics. It works regionally, nationally and internationally. = Education = The Bertelsmann Stiftung examines at regular intervals how much the Germany's states are investing in early childhood education and care. One of its studies confirmed, for instance, that children's developmental opportunities depend heavily on their background. In the field of school education, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has been devoting itself in recent years to all-day schools in particular and has called for their expansion. Digital learning is also an important issue, as it is seen as a solution to various structural problems in the area of education. In addition, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has also been involved for years in vocational education and training. In the 1990s, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's activities in the area of higher education received particularly widespread public attention, for example the establishment of the Centre for Higher Education (CHE) in 1994 by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the German Rectors' Conference. This institution sees itself as a \\"workshop\\" for developing reforms for Germany's higher education institutions. The Bertelsmann Stiftung holds 90% of the shares in CHE Gemeinn√ºtziges Centrum f√ºr Hochschulentwicklung GmbH. = Democracy = The Bertelsmann Stiftung is committed on both the national and the international level to strengthening democracy through the promotion of citizen participation in political decision-making and planning processes. With regard to cooperation between Germany's federal government, state and local institutions, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has been calling for several years for a revision of the system used to redistribute income among the country's states. The focus of the foundation's work in the field of democracy, however, is Europe. For years, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has advocated accelerating the EU's decision-making processes and promoting European integration. Internationally, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is researching existing governance structures and developing proposals to change them. One example is the concept of a non-profit rating agency. The Bertelsmann Stiftung also helped fund the Center for Applied Policy Research (CAP) in 2010. The center was founded by Werner Weidenfeld, who was also a member of the Bertelsmann Stiftung executive board until 2007. Both institutions cooperated on a number of issues, including European integration. The center is affiliated with the Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. = Society = One major focus of the work done by the Bertelsmann Stiftung is demographic change in Germany, a subject on which it has published several studies. It also promotes volunteer work and other activities that increase social cohesion, in part by awarding of the \\"Mein gutes Beispiel\\" (My Best Practice) prize. Social justice and intergenerational equity are also important concerns, and one of the reasons the foundation addresses these subjects is to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The Bertelsmann Foundation wants to promote social integration and diversity. It advocates for creating a \\"comprehensive and long-term migration architecture\\" for Germany. Other projects address young people and families. For example, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is critical of the increase in child poverty in Germany and the way the country's pension system disadvantages families. = Health = The Bertelsmann Stiftung regularly analyzed health care in Germany for what it calls its \\"Gesundheitsmonitor\\" (Health-Care Monitor). Moreover, it has launched several projects in the last few years that promote informed decision-making among the public in the area of health care. The projects include the Internet portal \\"Wei√üe Liste\\" (White List) which helps users find the doctor, hospital, nursing home or nursing service that is right for them. With the support of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, the Center for Hospital Management (CKM) was founded in 1994 as a research institute at the University of M√ºnster. In addition to research on clinical IT and logistics, the center organizes training for the clinic's staff. The Bertelsmann Stiftung is no longer one of the shareholders of the CKM Centrum f√ºr Krankenhausmanagement GmbH. The institute has become a completely independent organization. = Culture = The Bertelsmann Stiftung's oldest project in the field of culture is the competition Neue Stimmen (New Voices) international singing competition, which was launched by Liz Mohn in 1987 and still takes place today. It is one of the world's most important competitions for up-and-coming opera singers and is known as a \\"showcase for new talent.\\" The Bertelsmann Stiftung promotes an engagement with music in other ways as well. Model projects in this area have been carried out repeatedly since the end of the 1990s to achieve a number of objectives, including more and better music education in preschools. The goal is to increase social participation through singing and music. = Economy = The foundation has examined the impact of globalization on society is examined in terms of the opportunities and risks it presents. The Bertelsmann Stiftung advocates for developed countries to open their markets so that emerging economies can benefit more from economic developments. It has repeatedly published analyses and studies on changes in the German labor market, and the findings were partly incorporated into the Hartz reforms carried out during the Gerhard Schr√∂der government. The Bertelsmann Stiftung is also committed to promoting sustainability and ensuring German businesses act in a socially responsible manner. In collaboration with the Hans B√∂ckler Foundation, it carried out a study on employee participation in German companies.  Criticism  In recent years, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has been the subject of public debate. In 2007, Jens Wernicke and Torsten Bultmann published an anthology, entitled \\"Netzwerk der Macht ‚Äì Bertelsmann\\" (\\"Network of Power ‚Äì Bertelsmann\\"), which takes a critical look at the structure and activities of the Bertelsmann Stiftung. The book's 30 contributors focused in particular on the foundation's non-profit status and political influence. The anthology generated widespread public debate on the Bertelsmann Stiftung. Published in 2010, the book \\"Bertelsmannrepublik Deutschland ‚Äì eine Stiftung macht Politik\\" (\\"Bertelsmann's Republic of Germany: A Foundation Sets Policy\\") by author and journalist Thomas Schuler gained even greater attention. In it, Schuler describes how the Bertelsmann Stiftung seeks to make contact with leading politicians and to advise them. He criticized the Bertelsmann Stiftung as being \\"undemocratic\\" and lacking in transparency. In his opinion, the originally good idea behind the foundation developed into a \\"distorted world,\\" the basic organization of which he called into question. Schuler also criticized German foundation law, which allows foundations such as the Bertelsmann Stiftung to exist at all. Peter Rawert, an expert on foundations, noted that the Bertelsmann Stiftung is guaranteed a return on its holdings in the Bertelsmann Group that is probably lower than what could be achieved with a fixed-income investment. He also noted that in the United States this would have a negative impact on the foundation's non-profit tax status; moreover, he argued that the situation does not reflect the \\"standard of efficiency\\" normally endorsed by the Bertelsmann Stiftung. = Commercial interests = Due to its majority interest in the Bertelsmann Group, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has been repeatedly accused of combining non-profit and commercial interests. In 2009, the journalist and author Annette Jensen asserted that the Bertelsmann Stiftung's proposals generate artificial demand, particularly in terms of the purported need to streamline local government, a demand which the foundation then meets, for example through the Bertelsmann subsidiary Arvato. She suggested that the RTL and VOX television stations belonging to the Bertelsmann Group and numerous Gruner + Jahr magazines served the foundation by disseminating its messages. The sociologist and entrepreneur Frank Adloff has argued that it is indefensible that the foundation does not need to justify the use of its funds before any parliament or oversight authority. In the United States, he noted, non-profit foundations are not permitted to hold more than a 20% stake in a company in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest; in addition, they have to provide a public accounting of their expenditures. = Political influence = Another criticism involves a lack of democratic legitimacy. Commenting on the foundation's \\"engagement with civil society,\\" Wolfgang Lieb, former state secretary in the North Rhine-Westphalia Ministry of Science, has argued that this legitimacy is being increasingly diminished, and even replaced by, economic power. According to Lieb, private networks and behind-the-scenes advisors are thus turning into actual rulers. By consulting with politicians outside of government settings, Lieb suggests, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is pursuing a \\"privatization of politics,\\" a situation that offers mutual benefits: civil servants and politicians are given a protected space where they alone are provided with information free of charge and where they can engage in discussion, while the Bertelsmann Stiftung secures access to all the projects it wants to influence. Thus, no matter who is elected, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is always part of the government. Speaking with broadcaster Deutschlandfunk in 2007, the former SPD politician and publicist Albrecht M√ºller called the foundation an \\"anti-democratic institution.\\" In 2008, the journalist and politician Julika Sandt criticized the growing influence of the Bertelsmann Stiftung on German health care, saying that initiatives developed by the foundation lead to preferential treatment for privatized clinics and medical care centers to the detriment of self-employed physicians. According to Sandt, because Brigitte Mohn was a member of both the Bertelsmann Stiftung executive board and the supervisory board of Rh√∂n-Klinikum, the foundation's neutrality in the health sector is questionable. In 2012, Josef Kraus, president of the , spoke critically about the influence of the Bertelsmann Stiftung on education policy. He described its studies as \\"unscientific\\" and as \\"scare tactics.\\" Its activities almost always involved turning some alleged administrative failure into a scandal, Kraus said. He called on politicians to stop allowing themselves to be influenced by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and to take criticism of the foundation seriously. The non-profit organization Lobbycontrol sees the Bertelsmann Stiftung as a business-oriented initiative, similar to the \\"Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft\\" (Initiative for a New Social Market Economy) or the \\"Stiftung Marktwirtschaft\\" (Free Market Foundation). Lobbycontrol criticizes, for example, the \\"Standortcheck\\" (Business Location Check), which it says amounts to a canonical neoliberal reform. The Bertelsmann Stiftung has repeatedly refuted criticism asserting a lack of democratic legitimacy and unpermitted political influence. For example, Gunter Thielen, former chairman and CEO of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, made it clear that the foundation was not a \\"secret government,\\" that the formation of public opinion and policy is not a \\"top-down process,\\" and that it was unimaginable that a foundation or a company could use its own ideas to influence or control a country like the Federal Republic of Germany. = Political neutrality = The Bertelsmann Stiftung describes itself as politically non-partisan. The practical implementation of this principle, however, has been questioned from several sides, in particular because the foundation has only established contacts with \\"radical supporters of market policies\\" among left-leaning parties. In turn, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has often been characterized as a proponent of economic liberalism, but this is also controversial; some critics have also labeled the Bertelsmann Stiftung neoliberal. = Non-profit status = In 2006, the author and journalist Harald Schumann discussed the non-profit status of the Bertelsmann Stiftung in the Tagesspiegel newspaper. According to Schumann, the \\"shadow government in G√ºtersloh\\" runs on de facto on public money, because Reinhard Mohn saved an over ‚Ç¨2 billion in inheritance and gift taxes when he transferred three-quarters of the Bertelsmann Group capital shares to the foundation. Moreover, he asserts, the annual dividend payment to the foundation is tax-free and, with its annual budget of around ‚Ç¨60 million, the foundation does not spend nearly as much as it costs the state in terms of lost revenue. Arno Kl√∂nne, a sociologist and political scientist, has argued that the Bertelsmann Stiftung's non-profit nature was questionable because, he maintains, it actively promotes the business of the Bertelsmann Group. Ultimately, he suggests, its goal is to manage society using corporate methods and to privatize the tasks that should be handled by the state. In 2009, a group of independent legal experts found that the Bertelsmann Stiftung no longer met the requirements for a non-profit organization. On the contrary, they argued, the tax exemption was unjustly being used for the purpose of carrying out a transformation of society according to the beliefs of the Bertelsmann Stiftung's founder, Reinhard Mohn, by means of private, tax- financed private policy consulting and by bypassing democratic decision making processes through public discourse in Germany's constitutional bodies. The Bertelsmann Stiftung has always rejected these accusations, noting that its non-profit status has been recognized by the tax authorities and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. = Social welfare cuts = In 2007, the trade union ver.di terminated its cooperation with the Bertelsmann Stiftung. The reason was that Arvato, a division of the Bertelsmann Group, declared the privatization of public services a strategic business area. A corresponding motion was passed at the union's federal congress against the wishes of its federal governing board. The Bertelsmann Stiftung is the driving force behind privatizations and cuts to social welfare programs, critics claimed. This assessment was supported by participants at \\"Das Schattenkabinett aus G√ºtersloh\\" (\\"The Shadow Cabinet from G√ºtersloh\\"), a conference critical of Bertelsmann. In addition to ver.di, other participants included Attac, GEW, IG Metall and the Otto Brenner Foundation. The Bertelsmann Stiftung rejected the criticism from ver.di in particular as a \\"misunderstanding,\\" saying that both sides were not that far apart in their views on social problems.

The film is based on a play by Yukio Mishima which in turn is based on a novel by Rampo Edogawa. The play had previously been adapted to film in 1962 by director Umetsugu Inoue. Plot Shobei Iwase is a jeweler whose daughter Sanae works as a hostess at a club. Mrs. Midorikawa visits Sanae and introduces her to Yamakawa, young businessman from Tokyo. When they visit his room to look at a wedding doll, he chloroforms Sanae and stuffs her into a trunk. Detective Akechi explains that Yamakawa was actually a depressed man named Junichi Amamiya who was convinced by Black Lizard to kidnap Sanae. Suspecting this, Akechi sends his men to follow Amamiya and he successfully recovers Sanae. Akechi explains that Mrs. Midorikawa is actually Black Lizard in disguise. Black Lizard dresses in men's clothing to escape the hotel unnoticed. Sanae is told to stay in her room at her father's house, but his housekeeper Hina works to kidnap her along with another worker. Iwase's guard Matobe attempts to intervene but they cut off his hand, leaving blood all over Iwase's new sofa. Iwase demands the removal of the sofa, which his employees arrange while sneaking out Sanae in a hidden compartment underneath its seat. Black Lizard sends a note promising the return of Sanae in exchange for the Star of Egypt, a South African gem worth 120 million yen that is Iwase's prized possession. Iwase brings the gem to Black Lizard at New Shinonome pier at noon on August 4 as requested and Black Lizard lies that Sanae will be returned to him that night. Black Lizard takes Sanae on a ship to a private island but hears Akechi speaking from the e sofa's hidden compartment so Black Lizard thrusts a sword through it and orders the sofa thrown overboard. Akechi was actually hiding in the closet and appears before Black Lizard disguised as the old sailor Matsukichi. On the island, Black Lizard presents her collection of human bodies perfectly preserved as statues. Junichi Amamiya attempts to help Sanae escape but is caught and thrown in a cell with her, where she confesses that she is a woman named Yoko Sakurayana hired to be Sanae's double and he confesses that he got caught on purpose in order to be turned into one of Black Lizard's dolls to stay with her and be caressed by her forever. Junichi and Yoko fall in love. Black Lizard reads a newspaper article that Sanae has already been returned to her father and is infuriated. Akechi summons the police and reveals himself to Black Lizard. He frees Junichi and Yoko and lets them leave to live their life together. Hina attempts to throw a poisonous snake at Akechi but Black Lizard stops her by impaling her with a sword before running to her room. Akechi reveals that Black Lizard killed the real Matsukichi in the sofa compartment and Black Lizard reveals that she has consumed poison, whereupon she dies.

RITS was discovered in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and has been shown to be involved in the initiation and spreading of heterochromatin in the mating-type region and in centromere formation. The RITS complex in S. pombe contains at least a piwi domain-containing RNase H-like argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and an argonaute interacting protein Tas3 which can also bind to Chp1, while heterochromatin formation has been shown to require at least argonaute and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Loss of these genes in S. pombe results in abnormal heterochromatin organization and impairment of centromere function, resulting in lagging chromosomes on anaphase during cell division.  Function and mechanisms  The maintenance of heterochromatin regions by RITS complexes has been described as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, in which RITS complexes stably bind the methylated histones of a heterochromatin region using the Chp1 protein and induce co-transcriptional degradation of any nascent messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, which are then used as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase substrates to replenish the complement of siRNA molecules to form more RITS complexes. The RITS complex localizes to heterochromatic regions through the base pairing of the nascent heterochromatic transcripts as well as through the Chp chromodomain which recognizes methylated histones found in heterochromatin. Once incorporated into the heterochromatin, the RITS complex is also known to play a role in the recruitment of other RNAi complexes as well as other chromatin modifying enzymes to specific genomic regions. Heterochromatin formation, but possibly not maintenance, is dependent on the ribonuclease protein dicer, which is used to generate the initial complement of siRNAs.  Importance in other species  The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as some evidence suggests that heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells is independent of the components of the RNAi pathway. It is known, however, that plants and animals have analogous mechanism for small RNA-guided heterochromatin formation, and it is believed that the mechanisms described above for S. pombe are highly conserved and play some role in heterochromatin formation in mammals as well. In higher eukaryotes, RNAi-dependent heterochromatic silencing appears to play a larger role in germline cells than in primary cells or cell lines, and is only one of the many different forms of gene silencing used throughout the genome, making it more difficult to study. The role of RNAi in transcriptional gene silencing in plants has been characterized fairly well, and functions primarily through DNA methylation via the RdDM pathway. In this process, which is distinct from the process described above, argonaut-bound siRNA recognizes nascent RNA transcripts or the target DNA to guide the methylation and silencing of the target genomic region.

The spring is named for Jacob V. Brower who in 1896 declared it to be the source of the Missouri in his book published by the Pioneer Press titled The Missouri river and its utmost source. He visited the site in 1895 and buried a copper plate upon which the name of the river and the date were engraved. The spring is further than the spot Meriwether Lewis reported in 1805 as the source of the river above Lemhi Pass on Trail Creek. Both sources are near the Continental Divide in Montana. It is upstream from where the name \\"Missouri River\\" is first used. Though the copper plate has not been located, the site of Brower's Spring is believed to be at about on the north fork of where Hell Roaring Creek divides near its source. It is commemorated by a rock pile. Hell Roaring Creek flows west into the Red Rock River, which flows through Upper, then Lower Red Rock Lakes, west through Lima Reservoir, and then northwest into Clark Canyon Reservoir. From Clark Canyon Reservoir the Beaverhead River flows northeast to join the Big Hole River, forming the Jefferson River, which with the Madison and Gallatin Rivers form the Missouri at Missouri River Headwaters State Park at Three Forks, Montana. Brower's location is just below a ridge extending to the southeast from Mt.

The New York City Department of Education, which manages the public school system in New York City, is the largest school district in the United States, with more students than the combined population of eight U.S. states. Over 1 million students are taught in more than 1,200 separate schools. Primary and secondary schools Public secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. New York is one of seven states that mandate the teaching of Holocaust and genocide studies at some point in elementary or secondary school curricula. One of the major public policy issues in recent decades has been the attempt by poorer communities to get more state funding to compensate for what they cannot generate in property taxes. The reliance of most communities on local property taxes to support schools has created the paradoxical situation of residents in wealthier communities paying a lower tax rate than residents in communities of lower average income. While state law has required integrated schools since 1900 (overturning an 1894 law that permitted communities to establish separate schools for children of African-American descentMartha A. Sandweiss, Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line, New York: Penguin Press, 2009, pp. 213), patterns of residential segregation in many areas has often led to de facto segregated schools. As studies have shown the importance of integrating children from different economic classes, more than ethnic groups, communities are devising different methods, such as magnet schools, to deal with attracting diverse groups of students. In an effort to increase the proportion of black and Hispanic teachers in the state's schools, the Board of Regents has eliminated a requirement that aspiring teachers pass a literacy test as part of their certification. =Charter schools= , there were 183 charter schools serving 70,000 students in the state. =History= Between 2000 and 2009, school enrollment declined by 121,000 students, and the number of teachers increased by 15,000.

D. renale is distributed worldwide, but is less common in Africa and Oceania. It affects fish eating mammals, particularly mink and dogs. Human infestation is rare, but results in kidney destruction, usually of one kidney and hence not fatal. A 2019 review listed a total of 37 known human cases of dioctophymiasis in 10 countries with the highest number (22) in China. Upon diagnosis through tissue sampling, the only treatment is surgical excision. Synonyms Dioctophymosis,, dioctophymiasis, giant kidney worm, kidney worm infection, Dioctophyme renale infection History of discovery Dioctophyme renale was discovered in 1583. Almost two centuries later, in 1782, Johann Goeze first described D. renale upon discovering the worms in a dog kidney. The family Dioctophymidae has only one genus (Dioctophyme), and the name of the genus was in contention (with the possibility of being Dioctophyma) for two hundred years. The issue was finally resolved by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1989. In 2003, D. renale eggs were discovered in six human coprolites in the neolithic site Arbon-Bleiche 3, Switzerland. This location is near a lake, which likely provided early humans with access to freshwater fish and frogs. The samples were dated from 3,384-3,370 BC, and is evidence that the prevalence of this infection was higher in early human history (before full understanding of proper cooking techniques). Eggs were also found in 2019 in a well-preserved largely fish-eating settlement in England dating to 900 BC. Clinical presentation in humans Individuals with Dioctophyme renale infection typically present with unspecific symptoms including hematuria (blood in urine), nephritis, loin pain, renal enlargement, and/or renal colic (intermittent pain in the kidney area), which may result from the rare migration of worms through ureters. In some cases the fibrosis occurring after parasite infection is an incidental finding in ultrasound or CT scan, mimicking renal cancer, leading to radical nephrectomy. Adult worms typically only infect one kidney. The kidney is destroyed because of fibrosis, the development of excess fibrous connective tissue. Global renal dysfunction is typically limited because the non-infected kidney is usually capable of assuming the increased work. However, parenchymal inflammation can lead to death in extreme circumstances. Transmission and life cycle Adult Dioctophyme renale inhabit the kidney (typically the right kidney). Females produce eggs which are passed in urine. In aquatic environments, eggs embryonate after 15‚Äì100 days. These eggs are ingested by an aquatic oligochaete, hatch, penetrate blood vessels, and develop into a stage three larvae. A paratenic host may then ingest the oligochaete. The oligochaete or paratenic host is then eaten by a definitive host, wherein juveniles penetrate intestinal lining and migrate to the liver. After maturing for approximately 50 days, the juveniles then migrate to the kidneys (typically the right kidney). Upon maturation, D. renale can survive for five years. Definitive hosts are carnivorous mammals, notably mink, but also includes wolves, coyotes, foxes, dogs, raccoons, and weasels. Transmission to humans typically occurs upon ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater fish or frog. There are multiple reservoirs for D. renale. Confirmed cases of infection have occurred in minks, dogs, swine, bears, oxen, and humans. Morphology Dioctophyme renale eggs exhibiting the characteristic pitted and sculptured shell. D. renale is the largest nematode to parasitize humans. Adult male worms are 20‚Äì40 cm long and 5‚Äì6 mm wide; females can grow to 103 cm in length with a width of 10‚Äì12 mm. Both sexes appear bright red in color and taper at both the anterior and posterior ends. Male D. renale worms have a bursa, which is used to attach to facilitate mating. Eggs are 60-80 micrometres x 39-47 micrometres, contain an embryo, and have characteristic sculpturing of the shell. They have an oval-shape and brownish-yellow hue. Eggs have a thick shell, and the surface appears to be pitted except at the poles. Diagnosis The only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis is through the identification of D. renale eggs in a patient's urine. However, obtaining patient history (i.e., if the patient has consumed undercooked or raw freshwater fish) is an important first step that can be coupled with radiological exams to search for enlarged or calcified kidneys. Urinalysis will likely show hematuria blood tests may reveal eosinophilia. Management  Likely because of the rarity of human cases, there is no standard treatment for D. renale infection in humans. The only known means is surgical excision of either adult worms or the infected kidney. Nephrectomy is generally considered extreme for human cases. A physician reportedly used Ivermectin to treat a patient, who was effectively cured. The use of anti-helminth drugs has not yet been evaluated as the proper course of action to treat this infection. Epidemiology Though D. renale is distributed worldwide, though markedly less frequent in Africa and Oceania, human infection is extremely rare. Regions around the Caspian Sea have the highest number of cases, with the most occurring in Iran. Infections are also most commonly found in areas where freshwater fish is a dietary mainstay. Non-human infections are more common worldwide, especially in areas of temperate climate. Prevalence in mink populations may be high, such as portions of Ontario or Minnesota. Similarly, some minnow populations may be as high as 50%. Public Health and Prevention Strategies No public health measures have been undertaken or vaccines developed because of the rarity of human infection. The majority of D. renale infections have resulted from undercooked or raw freshwater fish consumption. Thus, the simple practice of thoroughly cooking fish prior to consumption could be promoted and lead to eradication of D. renale infection in humans.

Since 1954, it has been home to the Berliner Ensemble theatre company, founded in 1949 by Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht. The original name of the Neo-baroque construction by the architect Heinrich Seeling was Neues Theater. The first performance was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's play Iphigenie auf Tauris. Die Weber, a naturalistic drama by Gerhart Hauptmann, had its premiere in a private audience at the theatre on 26 February 1893. From 1903 to 1906, the Neues Theater was under the management of Max Reinhardt; it later became the site of numerous operetta performances. With the premiere of the comedy Der fr√∂hliche Weinberg by Carl Zuckmayer on 22 December 1925, the theatre returned to dramatic art, followed by the first performances of The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) on 31 August 1928 and of the Italienische Nacht by √ñd√∂n von Horv√°th on 20 March 1931. Bertolt Brecht staged Marieluise Flei√üer's play Pioneers in Ingolstadt on 30 March 1929, causing a scandal. The theatre saw Gustaf Gr√ºndgens giving his debut as a director with Jean Cocteau's Orph√©e and guest performances by the Truppe 31 stage company of Gustav von Wangenheim. From 1931 on, the theatre was called Deutsches Nationaltheater am Schiffbauerdamm. Notable actors included Lotte Lenya, Carola Neher, Hilde K√∂rber, Helene Weigel, Ernst Busch, Ernst Deutsch, Kurt Gerron, Theo Lingen, and Peter Lorre. With the Nazi takeover in 1933, the theatre declined and was finally closed in 1944. Veit Harlan made his directoral debut there in 1935 with Wolfgang B√∂ttcher's musical comedy Marriage on the Panke. Reopened after World War II, the theatre was finally taken over by Bertolt Brecht. Today, it is considered one of the most glamorous theatres in Germany and the building is currently undergoing historic preservation.

His history with UCLA began in the 1950s when he was a track and field city champion from Fremont High with plans to attend Compton College. However, his track coach, Bill Thayer, was a UCLA alumnus who thought differently. Thayer, aware of Doby's athletic talent and academic prowess, drove him to UCLA during the last week of school, urging the coaches to award him a scholarship. His only request was that Doby come back and teach for 3 years before deciding what he wanted to do with his life. Nearly a lifetime of service later, Doby made an indelible impression in education and at UCLA as one of the highest-ranking African Americans in the entire UC system. He received three degrees from UCLA: a bachelor's in mathematics, a master's in education, and a doctorate in higher education administration. Then in return, he gave back to the school that provided his education. He was the driving force behind building the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center, the Tom Bradley International Hall, and the renovation of the John Wooden Center. Teaching After graduating from UCLA with a degree in mathematics, Doby fulfilled a commitment to his high school mentor by returning to his alma mater, Fremont High School in Los Angeles, as a mathematics teacher. In 1968, Doby returned to UCLA to pursue graduate studies. After a one-year stint as Assistant Track Coach, he joined the administration full-time and held a variety of positions while completing work on his master's degree in education, with a focus on measurement and statistics, and his doctorate in higher education administration at UCLA. Lasting Legacy He rose through UCLA's ranks to become vice chancellor of student affairs, heading an organization responsible for providing programs and services to 36,000 students ‚Äî encompassing such units as undergraduate admissions, financial aid, the registrar's office, dean of students, residential life, health services and outreach. He led campaigns to build the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center, the Tom Bradley International Hall and to renovate the Wooden Center and the Men's Gym. Over the years, Doby chaired numerous task groups including one charged with developing a plan for addressing the impacts of Proposition 209. He served as co-chair of the UCLA outreach steering committee in addition to leading system wide task forces focused on the delivery of student services in the next decade and on enhancing the synergy between UC admissions and outreach policies.http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/alumni/winston-doby/ Doby was also an active \\"UCLA ambassador\\" in the larger community, particularly in the area of K-12 education. For more than a decade, he served as an external member of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Evaluation Planning Team, with a special focus on issues of student achievement, school desegregation, busing, and overcrowding. He also conducted multiple interviews at 12 elementary schools in LAUSD as part of a comprehensive evaluation of its Ten Schools Program. In 1971 Doby started the Academic Advancement Program (AAP) that is now used all over the country. The primary focus was and is to widen college access for students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Doby co-founded the community-based Young Black Scholars Program, which has helped to prepare thousands of young students for college in its 14-year history. In the early '90s, he founded the Black Male Achievement Project at Ralph Bunche Elementary School and launched the Los Angeles Sports Academy, designed to promote academic achievement through sport.http://www.calresearch.org/component/content/32?task=view He also founded a charter school for high school dropouts and was a key contributor to a middle school pilot program developed to improve mathematics competency. Dr. Doby worked tirelessly to help young people attend college; he was instrumental in establishing the UCLA/Black Alumni Association's \\"Ella Fitzgerald Memorial Scholarship\\". ‚ÄúNo written word or spoken plea can teach the children what they should be, nor all the books on all the shelves, it‚Äôs what the teachers are themselves,‚Äù¬ù former coach John Wooden said, applying one of his famous quotations to Doby's success as an educator.http://dailybruin.com/2002/05/09/dashew-center-honors-doby-for/ Family He has two children, Monica and Chris, and an ex-wife Althea.

Its associated anamorph is Drechslera graminea (Rabenhorst ex Schlechtendal) S. Ito 1930. P.W. Crous, W. Gams, J.A. Stalpers, V. Robert and G. Stegehuis. 2004. MycoBank: an online initiative to launch mycology into the 21st century. Studies in Mycology 50: 19‚Äì22. Identification Asexual stage: Pycnidia are rarely observed in nature. They are 70-176 Œºm in diameter, globose to pear-shaped, and develop superficially or partly submerged. The wall is thin and fragile and is yellow to brown, with a short ostiole. Pycnidiospores are 1.4-3.2 x 1.0-1.6 Œºm, spherical or ellipsoidal, hyaline, and nonseptate. Sexual stage: Perithecia are rare in nature, they occur in barley straw in the autumn. The perithecia are 576-728 x 442-572 Œºm. They are superficial to partly submerged and are elongate, with rigid setae on the surface. Acsi are club-shaped or cylindrical, clearly bitunicate, and rounded at the apex, with a short stalk at the base. Ascospores are 43-61 x 16-28 Œºm, light yellow-brown, ellipsoidal, and rounded at both ends, with transverse septa and one, occasionally two, septum in the median cells but never in the terminal cells. Conidia are borne laterally and terminally on conidiophores, which usually occur in clusters of three to five. The conidia are straight with rounded ends and measure 11-24 x 30-100 Œºm. They are subhyaline to yellow-brown and have up to seven transverse septa. In culture, mycelium is gray to olivaceous and is often sterile. Conidia may be formed when infected barley pieces as placed on water agar and incubated under diurnal light conditions followed by a period of chilling. Disease symptoms Severe seedling infection can cause stunting and post-emergence death, but symptoms are not usually apparent until later, when long, chlorotic or yellow stripes on leaves and sheaths appear. Most leaves of a diseased plant are usually affected. Dark brown streaks develop later in the stripes, which eventually dry out and cause leaf shedding. Ears may not emerge or be deformed and discoloured. Grain production by infected plants is severely restricted.Dickson, Diseases of Field Crops: 40-43, 1956; McKay, Cereal Diseases in Ireland: 113-116, 1957; Christensen & Graham, Technical Bulletin, University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station 95, 1934 (pathogen variation). Geographical distribution It is widespread and occurs in most barley-growing areas of the world. Physiological specialization Considerable variation in pathogenicity between isolates exists, but no formal physiologic races have been recognized. Biology The disease is mono-cyclic and seed-borne usually by mycelium in the pericarp. Perithecia are uncommon, but over-wintering sclerotia on crop debris have been reported from Russia. Secondary infection by conidia is apparently important only for floral infection and subsequent seed contamination.

Anesthesia providers  =Anesthesiologists= Anesthesiologists are physicians (MD/DO) specializing in the practice of anesthesiology. The training of a physician anesthesiologist typically consists of 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 1 year of internship, and 3 years of residency optionally followed by a one-year fellowship in a sub-specialty. It is the highest training level for all practitioners delivering anesthesia in the United States. While most physicians practicing anesthesiology in the United States pass a comprehensive board exam, board certification is not required in order to practice anesthesiology. Physicians who have successfully completed training in an ACGME accredited program become board eligible at the time of graduation and may practice anesthesiology until board certification is attained, commonly within one year post graduation. According to an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) press release Anesthesiologists provide or participate in more than 90 percent of the 40 million anesthetics delivered annually. Other specialties within medicine are closely affiliated to anesthesiology. These include intensive care medicine and pain medicine. Specialists in these disciplines have completed training in anesthesia including a three-year residency in anesthesia with an additional year in an accredited fellowship in a sub specialty of anesthesia (e.g. Pain, Critical Care Medicine, Obstetric Anesthesia, Pediatric Anesthesia). Anesthesiology is not limited to the operating room. Physician anesthesiologists are termed \\"peri-operative physicians\\", and are involved in optimizing the patient's health before surgery, performing the anesthetic and associated procedures (e.g. neuraxial anesthesia, specialized intravascular access), following up the patient in the post-anesthesia care unit and post-operative wards, and ensuring optimal analgesia throughout. Some sub-specialty physician anesthesiologists are an integral member of the critical care team in Surgical Intensive Care Units (SICU) and manage complex surgical patients throughout their hospitalization. =Nurse Anesthetist = Nurse anesthetists are advanced practice registered nurses specializing in the provision of anesthesia are Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). As of 2018, CRNAs represent 50% of the anesthesia workforce in the United States, with 52,000 providers, according to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, and administer approximately 36 million anesthetics each year. Thirty-four percent of nurse anesthetists practice in communities of less than 50,000 due to rural pass-through program where \\"eligible hospitals may use reasonable- costs based Part A payments in lieu of the conventional Part B payments as a rural practice inducement for non-physician anesthesia providers such as anesthesiologist assistants (a type of physician assistant) and nurse anesthetists to practice in small, low volume rural hospitals. Under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) current interpretation of the current ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù program, eligible small rural hospitals are not permitted to use the ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù funds to hire physician anesthesiologists.\\" https://www.asahq.org/advocacy-and-asapac/advocacy- topics/rural-pass-through-legislation CRNAs begin their education with a four- year Bachelor of Science degree, followed by approximately one year of critical care nursing experience, and completion of the CCRN certification. After the 2 to 3 years of CRNA school, they must pass the NBCRNA national certification exam.NBCRNA NCE http://www.nbcrna.com/certification/Pages/default.aspx. Retrieved 9 July 2016. CRNAs care for patients pre-, intra-, and postoperatively and practice in all facets of anesthesia care. They may care for patients independently, but usually work collaboratively as part of the ACT. Some choose to narrow the focus of care to sub specialize in the provision of cardiac, pediatric, pain, or obstetrical care. They perform all types of anesthesia care including general endotracheal and neuroaxial, as well as perform advanced intravascular access as needed. As of 2014, 17 governors opted out of the CRNA supervision requirement of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The remaining states maintain that CRNAs must work with anesthesiologists, podiatrists, dentists, surgeons, obstetricians or other professionals with similar anesthesia training. CRNAs administer anesthesia in all types of surgical cases, and are able to apply all of the accepted anesthetic techniques‚Äîgeneral, regional, local, or sedation. CRNAs also work as well in Anesthesia Care Teams. =Anesthesiology Assistants= Anesthesiologist assistants are advanced non-physician anesthesia providers qualified by graduate medical education and clinical training to work under the direction of an anesthesiologist in developing and implementing the anesthesia care plan. The anesthesiologist assistant as an anesthesist in the Anesthesia Care Team (ACT). Anesthesiologist assistants obtain pre-anesthetic health history, perform preoperative physical exams, establish non-invasive and invasive monitors, administer medications/IV fluids/blood products, evaluate and treat life-threatening situations, and execute general, local, and regional anesthetic techniques, as delegated by the anesthesiologist. Anesthesiologist assistants generally work in the hospital setting but can work at any location where they can be medically directed by anesthesiologists including pain clinics. Anesthesiologist assistants work under the medical direction of physician anesthesiologists in surgical environments such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplant surgery, and trauma surgery centers. The incorporation of anesthesiologist assistants into ACT teams across the country is a dynamic process, and currently there are sixteen states, as well as Washington D.C. and the Veteran's Affairs Medical System. In each of these states, the anesthesiologist assistant falls under the regulatory authority of the State Board of Medicine. As of 2017 there are twelve anesthesiologist assistant training programs in the United States all of which offer degrees at the Master's level. Approximately 97% of currently practicing anesthesiologist assistants hold a master's degree (some early anesthesiologist assistant graduates held bachelor's degrees). All newly credentialed and future anesthesiologist assistants must complete an accredited Master's program for anesthesiologist assistants. Upon completion of the educational program, graduates must sit for a credentialing exam that is co-validated by the National Board of Medical Examiners and National Commission for Certification of Anesthesiologist Assistants. All anesthesiologist assistant programs are credentialed by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Educational Programs (CAAHEP) =Anesthesia Supervision= Effective November 13, 2001, CMS established an exemption for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) from the physician supervision requirement. This exemption recognized a Governor's written request to CMS attesting that he or she is aware of the state's right to an exemption of the requirement for CRNA to be supervised by a physician trained in the provision of anesthesia. The attestation recognizes that it is in the best interests of the State's citizens to exercise this option in order to provide safe, cost effective, valuable anesthesia services and especially helps assure provision of those services to all citizens. As of March 2020, eighteen states have chosen to opt-out of the CRNA physician supervision regulation. The states are: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, California, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.\\"Spotlight\\" https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and- Guidance/Legislation/CFCsAndCoPs/Spotlight.html CMS.gov Retrieved 9 July 2016. =Anesthesia Care Teams= According to the ASA statement on the Anesthesia Care Team, anesthesia care personally performed or medically directed by an anesthesiologist constitutes the practice of medicine. According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists and state law in all fifty states, anesthesia care provided by a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesiologist is considered the practice of nursing. Certain aspects of physician directed anesthesia care may be delegated to other trained and credentialed professionals, including anesthesiologist assistants and CRNAs. Laws regarding anesthesia provision It has been established that, under US law, anesthesia is practice of both medicine and nursing. Frank v. South,175 Ky 416, 194 SW 375 (1917) Chalmers-Francis v. Nelson6 Cal 2d 402 (1936)https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/chalmers-francis-v-nelson-24857 and other court decisions determined that anesthesia was the practice of Nursing as well as Medicine. As such, the practice of anesthesia in the US may be delivered by a physician anesthesiologist, CRNA, or anesthesiologist assistant. The decisions have not been challenged since the Dagmar Nelson case. In addition to legal decisions, individual hospital and surgical facility policies also regulate the granting of anesthesia clinical privileges and are often based on contractual agreements with provider groups.

Around 445 BC he commanded the Persian army against the rebel satrap Megabyzus, but was defeated as was the previous commander, Usiris. A peace was signed c. 444 BC with Megabyzus after negotiations in which his father Artarius took part. Artaxerxes I died in 423 BC and was succeeded by his son Xerxes II, who, 55 days later, was murdered by his half-brother Sogdianus, Menostanes and the eunuch Pharnacyas. Sogdianus became king and named Menostanes as his prime minister and chief of the army. However, Sogdianus was later defeated and put to death by Ochus, a brother of Xerxes II, who took the throne and changed his name to Darius II. Pharnacyas was executed and Menostanes committed suicide. Apart from Ctesias, there are no classical sources on Menostanes, but he appears to be mentioned in some cuneiform tablets of the Murashu family from the Babylonian city of Nippur, in which he is called Manu≈°t√•nu.

Background Barclay was born in Masterton and was raised on farms in the Wairarapa. He was educated at St Joseph's College, Masterton.Stuart Murray, Images of Dignity: Barry Barclay and Fourth Cinema, Huia, Wellington, 2008, pp. 7-8. He spent six years from the age of 15 in Redemptorist monasteries in Australia and had begun training to be a Catholic priest in that order when he returned to New Zealand and embarked on a lengthy career in film, television and media. Later in life, he was based in Omapere, Hokianga, New Zealand before his death from a stroke at the age of 63. Films His early career in radio, then in film and television led to great recognition as a documentary maker in the 1970s and 1980s. His early experimental short documentaries Ashes, The Town That Lost a Miracle, and All That We Need, led to an invitation to direct Tangata Whenua, a six-part television documentary series that presented the language, culture and politics of New Zealand's Maori people to a mainstream prime-time audience (in 1974) for the first time. The series was made in collaboration with producer John O'Shea of Pacific Films and historian and writer Michael King. Barclay wrote and directed The Neglected Miracle, a feature-length political documentary on the ownership of plant genetic resources. The project was shot over two years in eight countries. After this success, Barclay left New Zealand for a time to live in Europe. He returned to make The Neglected Miracle, a documentary on the legal and societal challenges presented by assertions of ownership of genetic material, especially seed stocks, and an eponymous documentary on Indira Gandhi, then-Prime Minister of India. After these documentary projects, Barclay collaborated with screenwriter Tama Poata on the feature film, Ngati (1987), produced by John O'Shea. Ngati featured veteran Maori actor Wi Kuki Kaa in the lead role of 'Iwi.' The film was well received at several international film-festivals, and attracted critical acclaim. Barry's second feature film Te Rua (Pacific Films 1991), concerns an iwi's attempts to repatriate stolen carvings from a German museum back to their rightful place in Aotearoa. Te Rua was a German/New Zealand coproduction, and is acknowledged as a more complex and less successful film than Ngati. The issues raised in Te Rua - of 'ownership' versus 'guardianship' would form the basis of much of Barry's subsequent work. From the 1990s on, Barclay completed The Feathers of Peace, a documentary about the peaceful response by the Moriori people to invasion of the Chatham Islands, as well as The Kaipara Affair, on the wide- ranging implications of dwindling fish populations and the effects from development in the Kaipara harbour. His first book was Our Own Image (1990), about his film-making practices and the creation of Indigenous cinema. His second book, Mana Tuturu, (2005) makes proposals about Indigenous intellectual property rights. Recognition and Laureate Award In 2004, Barclay received an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Award. In the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours, Barclay was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film. After his death, Barclay's body was returned to Whangaehu Marae near Whanganui on Wednesday, 20 February 2008. His tangi (funeral) was held on Saturday, 23 February 2008. Documentary on Barclay (2009) A documentary on Barclay's life and work, Barry Barclay: The Camera on The Shore, (duration 102 minutes) directed by Graeme Tuckett and produced by Anne Keating, was completed in February 2009.

It is the sequel to 1995's Metropolitan. Plot summary The story begins shortly after the point where Metropolitan left off, with Aiah, the previous novel's protagonist, arriving in \\"Free Caraqui\\" to assist Constantine in his ambitions. In Caraqui, Constantine is confronted with intrigues among the other power players from the revolution, counter-coups, and war with the surrounding metropolises. He must also deal with the consequences of enlisting one of his more disturbing allies, Taikoen. Centuries previous, Taikoen was a powerful mage whose name passed into legend; he eventually transformed into a \\"hanged man,\\" an entity of pure plasm whose only remaining drive is to possess other human beings and use their bodies to experience sensual pleasures until his victims die extremely gruesome deaths as a side effect of the possession. Constantine had made a pact with Taikoen to provide him bodies to feed on in exchange for destroying certain of his enemies, but is now wracked with guilt for doing this and is conflicted between his need to use Taikoen to further his ambitions and his worry that he has unleashed a monster he cannot control. Aiah eventually grows to become a minor power in her own right in Caraqui, serving as a government liaison to some Barkazi mercenary units Constantine has hired to defend Caraqui (among many others). Aiah befriends a military mage from one of those units who helps her eventually destroy Taikoen. Despite the conflict still raging, Constantine works to pursue his ultimate plan for the New City - nothing less than the destruction of the Shield that imprisons humanity in the world and the confrontation of whatever powers placed it there. Seeing plasm as the key to humanity's liberation, he enlists the help of Rohder, one of Aiah's old colleagues from the Plasm Authority in Jaspeer (and a minor character in Metropolitan). A centuries-old researcher-mage, Rohder had discovered new geometric properties that could boost the production of plasm in cities, with the unfortunate need to completely reorder their infrastructure at prohibitive cost. Fortunately, Caraqui is a metropolis built on pontoons in the shallows of one of the world's seas, so Constantine enables him to experiment by physically moving parts of the city in concordance with his theory, which proves valid. Aiah also stumbles onto the knowledge that at periodic intervals, a small hole opens up in the Shield through which plasm- based constructs can be sent. At the same time, she has been having dreams in which she sees entities named the Sun and Moon outside the Shield; these celestial bodies are mostly legend in the world, but there is a belief that the tides seen in the world's seas are caused by the effects of their gravity, which is able to pass through the Shield. Aiah learns that her dreams have similarities with the teachings of a mysterious monastic order in Caraqui, the Dreaming Sisters. At the novel's conclusion, Aiah seems to join the Dreaming Sisters in their curious form of meditation as a way of discovering what her dreams mean in the context of freeing the world from the Shield. Status of possible sequel Metropolitan and City on Fire were published by HarperCollins, a result of Williams attempting to move to a publisher that would pay and promote him better than Tor Books, his previous publisher.Metropolitan: The Lawyers, Walter Jon Williams blog, April 2012 However, his editor was fired and the HarperPrism line cancelled soon after City on Fire was published. As a result, Williams would not be able to have a third volume in the series published without retrieving the rights for the first two and finding another publisher for them, along with the third book. Given the difficulty Williams had already encountered, he decided to pursue other projects with a more immediate payoff.Frequently Asked Questions, Walter Jon Williams web site The rights for the two books reverted to Williams in December 2010, although he did not learn this until April 2012.Three Works Fly Free, Walter Jon Williams blog, April 2012 He has not yet begun work on a third volume, although he has expressed interest in doing so, and has tentatively titled the third volume Heaven in Flames.Running Off the Cliff: City on Fire, Walter John Williams blog, May 2012 References Category:1997 American novels Category:1997 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Sequel novels ","title":"City on Fire (Williams novel)"},{"id":"9432867","text":"Peter Walsh (born 1956) is an Australian-American professional organizer, writer, and media personality.

It is universally recognized as \\"one of the most terrible Nazi prisons in occupied Poland\\".Adam Bajcar, Poland: A Guidebook for Tourists, tr. S. Tarnowski, Warsaw, Interpress Publishers, 1972. So also: Studia Historyczne, vol. 30, 1987, p. 106: \\"Wiƒôzienie Montelupich w Krakowie nale≈ºa≈Ço do najciƒô≈ºszych w Generalnym Gubernatorstwie\\" (The Montelupich Prison in Krakow was among the most severe prisons in the General Government). The Gestapo took over the facility from the German Sicherheitspolizei at the end of March 1941. One of the Nazi officials responsible for overseeing the Montelupich Prison was Ludwig Hahn.PiƒÖtkowska 1977 (see Bibliography), p. 29. World War II prisoners at Montelupich were made up predominantly of the ethnically Polish political prisoners and victims of the Gestapo street raids, but also German members of the SS and Security Service (SD) who had been sentenced to jail terms, British and Soviet spies and parachutists, soldiers who had deserted the Waffen-SS, and regular convicts. The number of political prisoners who passed through or ended their lives in the Montelupich in the years 19401944 is estimated at 50,000.J√≥zef Batko, Gestapowcy, Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, 1985. . Cited in Cezary Le≈ºe≈Ñski's review of the book in Nowe KsiƒÖ≈ºki, 1986, p. 127. Kurkiewiczowa (see Bibliography) states that \\"medieval tortures\\" constituted the fundamental and principal interrogation method of the Germans. Although the inscription on the plaque by the (side) door of the prison in the 1939 photograph pictured at right actually reads, \\"Sicherheits-Polizei-Gef√§ngnis Montelupich\\", the name \\"Montelupich Prison\\" is strictly informal, based on common popular convention, even if it has now passed in that form into history. The Montelupich facility was the detention centre of the first instance used by the Nazis to imprison the Polish professors from the Jagiellonian University arrested in 1939 in the so-called Sonderaktion Krakau, an operation designed to eliminate Polish intelligentsia. In January 1944, 232 prisoners from Montelupich were executed by a Nazi firing squad at Pe≈Çkinie.Przewodnik po upamiƒôtnionych miejscach walk i mƒôcze≈Ñstwa: lata wojny 19391945, ed. Rada Ochrony Pomnik√≥w Walki i Mƒôcze≈Ñstwa, 2nd ed., Warsaw, Sport i Turystyka, 1966, p. 299. In late January or early February 1944, Wilhelm Koppe issued an order for the execution of 100 Montelupich prisoners as a reprisal for the unsuccessful attempt on the life of Hans Frank.Przewodnik po upamiƒôtnionych miejscach walk i mƒôcze≈Ñstwa: lata wojny 19391945, ed. Rada Ochrony Pomnik√≥w Walki i Mƒôcze≈Ñstwa, 2nd ed., Warsaw, Sport i Turystyka, 1966, p. 186. In the locality called Wola Filipowska near Krakow there is a monument commemorating the execution by the Nazis of 42 hostages, all Montelupich prisoners who died on the spot before a firing squad on 23 November 1943. After World War II Montelupich became a Soviet prison where NKVD and UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa tortured and murdered Polish soldiers of the Home Army. At present, the building serves as a temporary arrest and detention facility for men and women, with 158 jail cells and a prison hospital with additional 22 cells. History of the property The building housing the prison was not originally constructed for its purpose, but instead, was a historical property that was redecorated in the Italianate Renaissance style in 1556 by the Italian Montelupi family who introduced the first postal service in Poland for the court of Sigismund III Vasa.Letizia Gianni, Polonia: Varsavia, Lublino, Cracovia, Breslavia, Toru≈Ñ, Danzica, i Monti Tatra e la Masuria, Milan, Touring Club Italiano, 2005, p. 101. . Their Krak√≥w manor house, known in Polish as the Kamienica Montelupich (Palazzo Montelupi in Italian), at Number 7 of the street to which it gave the name, was the starting point of the first international postal coach in Poland which departed from here for Venice in 1558.Jan Adamczewski, Krak√≥w od A do Z, Krakow, Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, 1980, p. 85. The Jalu Kurek Park (see Park Jalu Kurka) in Krakow was formerly the palace garden of the palazzo Montelupi. Current status The prison was the site of the last administration of the death penalty in Poland, performed by hanging on 21 April 1988.\\"Gwa≈Çciciel i zab√≥jca zawis≈Ç: ostatnia egzekucja w Polsce\\", Gazeta Wyborcza, 20 April 2011. (see online). Despite being officially recognized as both a historical monument and a place of martyrdom, the facility continues to be operated to this day as a combination of remand prison and ordinary correctional facility by the Polish Prison Administration (the S≈Çu≈ºba Wiƒôzienna), a unit of the Polish Justice Ministry. Its current official name is Areszt ≈öledczy w Krakowie. The infamous history of this facility continues to the present day, as evident in the 2008 death of the Romanian detainee, Claudiu Crulic (19752008; see Claudiu Crulic), an incident condemned by human rights groups (such as the Human Rights House Foundation of Oslo, Norway) which occasioned the resignation of the Romanian Foreign Affairs Minister, Adrian Cioroianu.Human Rights House Foundation, \\"Starvation Death of a Romanian at a Detention Center.\\" Oslo, Norway.

This culture flourished under the Avars' domination of Pannonia and is especially noteworthy for artifacts (mainly of gold) produced by artisans in Keszthely. History Gold pin with the name BONOSA and Byzantine-style rings Pannonia, a province of the Western Roman empire, was devastated by the barbarian invasions (Huns, Gepids, Avars, etc.). Only a few thousand Romanized Pannonians survived the onslaughts, mainly around Lake Pelso (now lake Balaton) in small fortified villages such as Keszthely. Roman Pannonia and surrounding areas The Romanic population from Pannonia created the Keszthely culture that evolved mainly during the 6th-7th centuries. Its artifacts were made in the workshops of Roman origin located mainly in the fortified settlements of Keszthely-Fen√©kpuszta and Sopianae (modern P√©cs). The Romanic craftsmen worked for their Gepid and Avar masters. Under the Avars, the Roman castle of Fen√©kpuszta near Keszthely and the surroundings were not occupied, so the original Romanized inhabitants lived on undisturbed. They paid food and artisan goods for peace from the Avars. After 568 new Christian Romanized Pannonians arrived here, probably from the destroyed Aquincum (modern Budapest). The Keszthely-Fen√©kpuszta fortress became the centre of a 30 km diameter area, where the people buried their dead adorned with jewellery and clothing of Byzantine origin. They rebuilt the fortress basilica, where the principals of the community were buried, while their relatives found their final resting places next to the nearby horreum (granary). In 626, the Avars were seriously defeated under Constantinople, which was followed by a civil war. The leaders of the Keszthely-Fen√©kpuszta community had supported those who were later defeated. That was why the Avars besieged and then destroyed the fortress of Fen√©kpuszta. They made the rest of the Romanized population move into the territory of the town centre. The Christian Romanized population was subjected to military suppression. The cemeteries of the 7th and 8th centuries entombed both Avars and Christians, but they were buried separately. The different religions did not allow them to mix even after death. The Christian Romanized populace, which spoke its own Romance Pannonian language, was cut from the outer world and created a unique, characteristic material culture, which we know from the artifacts of the cemeteries near Keszthely. These finds have been termed Keszthely culture. At that time, Keszthely was the center of the Pannonian region, because the area of Lake Balaton was crossed by roads connecting the Danube and the Mediterranean. At the end of the 8th century, the Franks under Charlemagne overthrew the Avar Empire and invaded the Pannonian plains. The Christian Romanized populace living around Keszthely quickly adopted the customs of western Christendom, which meant among other things that they buried their dead without grave goods so now it is impossible to identify them. The Fen√©kpuszta fortress was repaired again in the 9th century. Its walls accommodated and gave shelter to the descendants of the Avars and the Slavic people who had migrated in at the beginning of the century. Their cemeteries maintained many of the pagan customs. The 10th century was the darkest period of Keszthely's history. No traces of any surviving Romanized Pannonian populace of the earlier period nor of the conquering Hungarians are known to us. Handicrafts Characteristic garment pins and basket-shaped earring pendants Modern depiction of a Roman Pannonian girl (6th century), wearing ornaments of the Keszthely culture. By the end of the 6th century, the Romanized populace was mainly buried in the row cemeteries that were newly laid out in the area of the late Roman fortresses of Keszthely (Castellum) and P√©cs (Sopianae) (southwestern Hungary). During the period of Avar rule, Romanized and Byzantine people arrived from the Balkans, and they helped develop a community of skilled artisans. These communities, probably Christian, preserved or renewed their artistic relations with the Romanized population of the Mediterranean. The characteristic garb of women included earrings with basket-shaped pendants, disc brooches with early Christian motifs, and garment pins. The early Christian symbols include crosses, bird-shaped brooches and pins decorated with bird figures (one bird- shaped brooch bears an incised cross). The Romanized populace of Pannonia in general became ‚ÄòAvarized‚Äô, and their ‚Äòisland‚Äô of late antique culture is documented only in the immediate vicinity of Keszthely, where their traditional costume was worn until the beginning of the 9th century. Language The name Keszthely (IPA ) could be related to the Istriot‚ÄìVenetian castei, which means \\"castle\\", and is probably an original word of the Pannonian Romance language, according to the Austrian linguist Julius Pokorny.Indogermanisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch He also posits that the word Pannonia is derived via Illyrian from a Proto-Indo-European root *pen- \\"swamp, water, wet\\". If true, that would suggest that the pre-Roman language of Pannonia was an Illyrian language. According to Romanian linguist Alexandru Rossetti,Istoria limbii rom√¢ne Pannonian Romance probably contributed to the creation of the 300 basic words of the \\"Latin substratum\\" of the Balkan Romance languages. Some scholars argue that the Pannonian Romance lacks clear evidences of existence, because no written sources exist. However, according to √Årthur S√≥s,Cemeteries of the Early Middle Ages (6th‚Äì9th centuries) at P√≥kaszepetkin in some of the 6000 tombs of the Keszthely culture, there are words in vernacular Latin.

Early life  She was born in Taunton, Somerset, where her father was a railway guard. The family moved to Wolverhampton, where she later became a schoolteacher. A Methodist lay preacher, she was initially a Liberal, but joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1917.  Electoral history  Under her maiden name of Florence Widdowson, she first stood for Parliament at the Cheltenham by-election in 1928, and at the 1929 general election, she contested the Rushcliffe constituency in Nottinghamshire. After her marriage in 1930 to the future Labour MP John Paton, she stood again in Rushcliffe in 1931. When the ILP split from Labour in 1932, John and Florence Paton stayed with the ILP. They left the following year, and rejoined the Labour Party, but by then the Rushcliffe Constituency Labour Party had selected H. J. Cadogan as its prospective parliamentary candidate. She was reselected as candidate only after Cadogan had been defeated in the 1934 by- election and at the 1935 general election. She won the Rushcliffe seat at the 1945 general election, but after boundary changes in 1950, she stood at the 1950 general election in the new Carlton constituency. She lost by only 395 votes to the Conservative Party candidate Kenneth Pickthorn, and although she stood again in 1951 and 1955, Pickthorn increased his majority on each occasion.  In Parliament  At the start of the 1946-47 session of Parliament, she was nominated by the Speaker to the Chairmen's Panel of Members to act as temporary chairmen of committees of the whole House and chairmen of standing committees. During a supply day debate on Scottish civil aviation estimates on 31 May 1948, she became the first woman to preside over the whole House of Commons. She did not, however, sit in the Speaker's Chair. When the House is in committee, the chairman sits at the table, rather than in the Speaker's Chair; the first woman to occupy the Speaker's Chair was the Conservative Party MP Betty Harvie Anderson (Conservative), on 2 July 1970, who took the Chair during the debate on the Queen's Speech.Women in the House of Commons , House of Commons Information Office, Members series Factsheet M04 In 1947, she was a British delegate to the United Nations.  After Parliament  From 1955 to 1958, Paton was a member of the Royal Commission on common land. She died in Wolverhampton on 12 October 1976. Her husband John, who had held his parliamentary seat until 1964, died two months later.

It includes part of the 8th Street business district. The majority of its residents live in a townhouse or apartment-style multiple unit dwellings, with a sizeable minority of low- density, single detached dwellings. As of 2016, the area is home to 7,645 residents. The neighbourhood has an average family income of $37,770, a homeownership rate of 67.0% and an average home sale price of $300,327. History Lakewood Park Before being part of Saskatoon, the land for Wildwood was used for agriculture. It includes part of the Sutherland Moraine, a ridge that forms a local topographic high. George Stephenson, who ranched in the Dundurn area in the 1880s, operated a dairy farm along 8th Street until 1911. The intersection of 8th Street and Central Avenue (now Acadia Drive) was referred to as \\"Stephenson's Corner\\" for many years. The streetcar line from Saskatoon to Sutherland ran east down 8th Street and turned north into Sutherland. The Wildwood Golf Course existed before any residential development occurred. It opened on July 1, 1931, and was Saskatoon's first golf course. As well, the Saskatoon Stock Car Racing Association operated a racing oval on land between the present-day Moss Avenue and McKercher Drive. In 1968, the SSRCA had to find another home when the City of Saskatoon announced its intention to expand eastward and annex the land. The land where Wildwood now exists was annexed in the period between 1970 and 1974, and the golf course's name was chosen for the name of the new neighbourhood. Home construction was at its peak from 1971 until 1980. Wildwood School opened on May 9, 1978. Bishop Pocock School opened in 1978, and the Lakewood Civic Centre was opened in 1988. Government and politics Wildwood Golf Course Wildwood exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîGrasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is divided by Heritage Crescent into the constituencies of Saskatoon Churchill-Wildwood and Saskatoon Southeast. Saskatoon Churchill-Wildwood is currently represented by Lisa Lambert of the Saskatchewan Party since 2016. Saskatoon Southeast is currently represented by Don Morgan of the Saskatchewan Party since 2003. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Wildwood lies within ward 9. It is currently represented by Councillor Bev Dubois, first elected in 2016. Institutions =Education= *Bishop Pocock School - separate (Catholic) elementary, part of Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools *Cliff Wright Branch Library - officially opened on January 9, 1989, as part of the Lakewood Civic Centre. * Wildwood School - public elementary, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division =Public Safety= * Fire Station #6 - covers the southeast area of Saskatoon.

Parks and recreation *Heritage Green - *Heritage Park - *Lakewood Park, district section - *Wildwood Park - *Lakewood Park, multi- district section - Parts of Lakewood Park are landscaped with natural prairie grassland vegetation. As well, the park contains a constructed wetland area, designed to remove pollutants from stormwater and control runoff. The wetland's waters and native plants in turn provide habitat for native aquatic animals, insects, and birds. The Wildwood Community Association coordinates recreational programs and social activities, maintains the park and outdoor rink, and promotes the well-being of residents. The volunteer-run association also provides a voice for the community on issues of local concern. The Lakewood Civic Centre houses a swimming pool and waterslide, fitness facilities, meeting and recreational space, and the Cliff Wright Branch Library all in one facility. The Wildwood Golf Course is an 18-hole course that has an intermediate level of play. It includes a practice green, pro shop and coffee shop. Commercial Centre Mall East Wildwood's northern border includes the eastern end of the 8th Street business district. Predating Wildwood's residential development to the south, the County Fair Plaza shopping centre operated at Circle Drive and 8th Street and included a Zellers department store and Canada Safeway. In 1977, Wildwood Mall opened across Acadia Drive from County Fair Plaza on the former Stephenson dairy farm land and added retailers such as Woolco (and later Wal-Mart) to the area. In the mid-1980s, County Fair Plaza was expanded into a larger mall called Circle Centre Mall. In the late 1990s, Wildwood Mall (which had been struggling since losing one of its anchor tenants, Dominion grocery stores) and Circle Park merged to become The Centre at Circle and 8th, which was later rebranded The Centre, with the two malls linked via a tunnel under Acadia Drive. In addition to The Centre, a few satellite businesses are located in freestanding buildings along 8th Street, straddling the mall property. Location Wildwood is located within the Lakewood Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by 8th Street to the north, Boychuk Drive to the east, Taylor Street to the south, and Circle Drive to the west. Inside those boundaries, the roads are a mix of local and collector roads. McKercher Drive, a north-south arterial road, roughly bisects the neighbourhood; Acadia Drive is another north-south arterial road in the west half of Wildwood.

The girl ventures out into the blizzard and eventually meets the 12 personified months by a warm fire in the woods.

Ellenberg was an advocate of viewing ecological systems through holistic means. He developed 9‚Äìpoint scales for rating European plant preferences for light, temperature, continentality (geographic region), nutrients, soil moisture, pH, and salinity.  Life  Ellenberg's father (a school teacher) died during World War I in 1914. From 1920 to 1932 Ellenberg studied in Hanover, where his interest in local flora and fauna was established, and where he came in contact with Reinhold T√ºxen. In 1932 he moved to Montpellier, where he started his studies of ecology under the direction of Swiss ecologist Josias Braun-Blanquet. Later he studied botany, zoology, chemistry and geology in Heidelberg, Hanover and G√∂ttingen, where he obtained a doctorate in 1938 in G√∂ttingen under Franz Firbas. After completing his doctorate he worked at the central office for vegetation mapping in Hannover under the direction of Reinhold T√ºxen and during World War II served in a \\"research relay\\". Ellenberg successfully worked on developing roof plantings of bunkers that would allow them to blend in with landscape and deceive hostile airplanes. These proceeded from layers of earth up to two meters thick, which are still visible today. After the war he served as an assistant of Heinrich Walter in Stuttgart. In 1953 he became a professor at the University of Hamburg. From 1958 he was a director at Department of Botany at the ETH Zurich. Heinz Ellenberg was among the first to experimentally show the importance of a distinction between fundamental niche and realized niche for plants. He experimentally grew two species of Bromus along a moisture gradient and showed that, in monoculture,both species were able to inhabit the entire range. Nevertheless, in mixture, the two species dissociated and showed clear preference for either the dry or the moist end of the gradientEllenberg, H.

In 1966 he moved to the University of G√∂ttingen, where he established the Neuer Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t G√∂ttingen. He became emeritus in 1981. From 1982 to 1986, he served as president of the International Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS). He is a Honorary Member of the International Association for Vegetation Science (1988).

In 1890 he joined the London music publishing company,Young, Preface, p.xv Novello as a music reader.Kennedy, p.38 Elgar's relationship with Jaeger is documented in Percy M. Young's book showing eleven years of correspondence, Letters to Nimrod. Jaeger met Edward Elgar in late 1897, when he was publishing office manager at Novellos, Kennedy, p.39 and their first correspondence was regarding the publication of Elgar's Te Deum and Benedictus.Young, Preface,p.xv His advice, friendship and encouragement became invaluable to Elgar, for example causing the composer to rework many famous musical passages, including the finale to his Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma Variations) and the climax of The Dream of Gerontius. Jaeger has been immortalized in the famous ninth variation \\"Nimrod\\" from the Variations, recalling a conversation on the slow movements of Beethoven (Nimrod was a Biblical hunter, a pun on the German word for hunter, J√§ger). Jaeger championed the work of the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, claiming to Elgar that Coleridge-Taylor was \\"a genius\\". In 1898 Jaeger married Isabella Donkersley of Magdale, Honley near Holmfirth in West Yorkshire, an accomplished violinist and pupil of Henry Holmes in the Royal College of Music, and they had two children. At the beginning of 1905 Jaeger was ill with tuberculosis and went to Davos in Switzerland,Young, p.247 but he was still receiving a pension from Novellos.

The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $65,927, an average dwelling value of $227,522 and a home ownership rate of 76.8%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $252,618. History The land for the Lakewood Suburban Centre was annexed between 1975 and 1984. Residential construction began in 2003 after infrastructure had been completed. The housing stock is composed entirely of low-rise apartment style condominiums and townhouses. City council approved architectural controls for some of Lakewood SC's development in 2006. All the lots in the neighbourhood have been purchased, so development will continue until full build-out is achieved. When Lakewood Suburban Centre first appeared on city maps in the 1980s it had different boundaries further to the west, encompassing the Heritage subdivision, including the area recreation centre and library, as well as the Wildwood Golf Course. In the 1990s, the City of Saskatoon revised its community boundaries, extending the boundary of the Wildwood neighbourhood east to Boychuk Drive, encompassing the land previously defined as being the Lakewood Suburban Centre. Lakewood Suburban Centre was subsequently redefined as the region to the southeast of Boychuk Dr. and Taylor Street.

The nineteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Sergio developed from a tropical wave on November 13 about 460 miles (740 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on November 15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November 20 about 320 miles (515 km) west-northwest of it originally formed. Sergio produced light rainfall along the coast of Mexico, though its effects were minimal. The formation of Sergio marked the 2006 season as the busiest in 12 years and the first season in which more than one tropical storm formed in November. Sergio, in addition to being the strongest hurricane after November 1, was also the longest-lived Pacific tropical cyclone in November, lasting a total of seven days. Meteorological history A tropical wave crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward to the south of Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400 miles (645 km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty- One-E while located about 460 miles (740 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later. Initially, the tropical depression tracked to the northwest, and was forecast to peak as a 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm while continuing on a northwest motion. Located within an area of weak wind shear, deep convection increased near the center, and banding features became more pronounced. Anticyclonic flow aloft and a moist troposphere allowed the depression to intensity into Tropical Storm Sergio on November 14. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, Sergio turned to the southeast, believed to be due to the flow associated with a mid- to upper-level trough to its northeast. It steadily intensified, and Sergio attained hurricane status on November 15 while located about 420 miles (675 km) southwest of Acapulco. With a small, distinct eye located in the center of the deep convection, Sergio rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) about 6 hours after becoming a hurricane. QuikSCAT image of Sergio on November 16 Upon reaching peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio to intensify further to reach winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane turned to the north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed on the west side of the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm later that day. A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in a slight increase in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225 miles (360 km) southwest of Michoac√°n. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and later that day Sergio dissipated about 360 miles (580 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, or about 320 miles (515 km) west-northwest of where it originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for about a day before the minimal amount of convection diminished. Impact and records No tropical cyclone warnings or watches were issued in relation to Sergio. Several storm advisories indicated a slight threat to coastal regions of Mexico; the National Hurricane Center assessed a 29% probability of tropical storm-force winds affecting Barra de Navidad in Jalisco. From November 16 and 17, the outer rainbands of the hurricane dropped light precipitation along the Mexican coastline, peaking at 1.97 inches (50 mm) at Tierra Colorada in Guerrero. Sergio contributed to November 2006 being the most active November since Pacific hurricane records began, based on using the accumulated cyclone energy index. This record later became tied with another season nine years later. After Rosa formed a few days before Sergio, November 2006 became the first since 1961 to have more than one storm in the month. The hurricane is currently the third strongest in the month, as well as the longest-lasting.

At the time of its release, the Ion was the first fully electropneumatic marker aimed at entry-level players, at a price point similar to Spyders and other mechanical blowbacks. The Ion has generally been credited with making high-rate-of-fire electropneumatic markers generally available, at a time when electropneumatic markers were considered out of reach of most casual or budget players.Smart Parts Ion Review at WARPIG The original Ion was released in 2005, and soon soared in popularity, though it was often criticized for being difficult to disassemble and service.Maintaining the Smart Parts Ion at Paintball Times Smart Parts addressed these concerns in 2007 with the release of the Ion XE, which allows the bolt to be removed from the back of the marker.http://www.smartparts.com/#/ion-xe/home/ Features The Ion's receiver consists of a breech and firing chamber, both hard-anodized. Its grip frame and ASA are both made of die-cast aluminum and are powder-coated. The outer shell of the Ion is polymer. The Ion includes the Vision system, or eyes, an infrared emitter and receiver on either side of the chamber. This prevents the Ion from firing when a ball is not fully loaded in the chamber, reducing the number of \\"chopped\\" balls. The Ion is highly customizable: it is sheathed in a removable polymer shell, which comes in several different colors. This shell can also be replaced with aftermarket \\"body kits\\" to change the appearance of the Ion, similar to the kits available for the Tippmann A5 marker and others. These body kits also affect the performance of the gun and accessibility of the bolt. Body kits such as the lucky and deadlywinds are BOB (bolt out the back), and allow easy access and cleaning of the bolt. In addition to these body kits, several aftermarket replacement parts such as triggers and feednecks are available. The Ion board is manufactured in two forms: one intended for distribution in the United States, and another for distribution in the United Kingdom. The UK version of the board does not have burst or fully automatic firing modes and is identified by the green power LED. The US version of the board includes all firing modes and has a red power LED. This board can also be replaced with a number of aftermarket boards (such as Blackheart or Virtue boards) which offer greater control over the timing of the firing action, different firing modes, and a higher maximum rate of fire, in most cases limited only by the mechanical capabilities of the marker itself.How the Ion Works at WARPIG Due to the large number of aftermarket upgrades available, the Ion can be customized or used stock to hold its own in today's fast-paced speedball tournaments. It can also easily be made into a competent woodsball marker. Operation Internally, the Ion features a spool-valve design, similar to a Shocker SFT or a Dye Matrix. However, the operation of the Ion is somewhat simpler than a Shocker SFT or Matrix in that it does not use a 4-way solenoid valve. The Ion's solenoid valve only has three hoses: one to provide air to the solenoid, one to provide air to a reservoir chamber behind the bolt, and the other which provides air to the front of the bolt to hold it back while the marker is at rest. The solenoid thus directs air either to the front of the bolt when not firing, or to the air reservoir behind the bolt, to blow it forward. When the Ion is fired, the air in front of the bolt that holds it back is drained back through the solenoid, which causes the air in the rear of the firing chamber to blow the bolt forward. In order to expedite the draining of air from the front of the bolt, many users add a quick exhaust valve (QEV) to their marker. The QEV replaces a fitting on the Ion's body and allows the draining air to vent into the body cavity instead of passing all the way back through the solenoid. By allowing the air to vent faster, this allows the bolt to close faster and with more force, which permits lower operating pressure and dwell (the time the solenoid valve is open). The QEV also acts as a trap for excess grease that might otherwise enter the solenoid and cause problems. Two other markers manufactured by Smart Parts, the SP-8 and the Epiphany, are based on the Ion's spool-valve design.

The army was created in the Soviet Union but, in March 1942, based on an understanding between the British, Polish, and Soviets, it was evacuated from the Soviet Union and made its way through Iran to Palestine. There it passed under British command and provided the bulk of the units and troops of the Polish II Corps (member of the Polish Armed Forces in the West), which fought in the Italian Campaign. Establishment in the Soviet Union At the start of the Soviet invasion of Poland (17 September 1939), the Soviets declared that the Polish state, previously invaded by Axis forces on 1 September 1939, no longer existed, effectively breaking off Soviet-Polish relations.See telegrams: No. 317 of September 10 : Schulenburg, the German ambassador in the Soviet Union, to the German Foreign Office.

Due to British mediation and pressure, the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile (then based in London) re-established Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations in July 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union started on 22 June 1941. The Sikorski‚ÄìMayski agreement of 30 July 1941 resulted in the Soviet Union agreeing to invalidate the territorial aspects of the pacts it had had with Nazi Germany and to release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to the agreement between the Polish government- in-exile and the Soviet Union, the Soviets granted \\"amnesty\\" to many Polish citizens, from whom a military force was formed. A Polish-Soviet military agreement was signed on 14 August 1941; it attempted to specify the political and operational conditions for the functioning of the Polish army on Soviet soil. Stalin agreed that this force would be subordinate to the Polish government-in-exile, while operationally being a part of the Soviet-German Eastern Front.Halik Kochanski (2012).

On 4 August 1941 the Polish prime minister and commander-in-chief, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, nominated General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, just released from the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, as commander of the army. General Micha≈Ç Tokarzewski began the task of forming the army in the Soviet town of Totskoye in Orenburg Oblast on 17 August. Anders announced his appointment and issued his first orders on 22 August. The formation began organizing in the Buzuluk area, and recruitment began in the NKVD camps among Polish POWs. By the end of 1941 the new Polish force had recruited 25,000 soldiers (including 1,000 officers), forming three infantry divisions: 5th, 6th and 7th. Menachem Begin (the future leader of the anti- British resistance group Irgun, prime minister of Israel and Nobel Peace Prize winner) was among those who joined. In the spring of 1942 the organizing center moved to the area of Tashkent in Uzbekistan and the 8th division was also formed. The recruitment process met obstacles. Significant numbers of Polish officers were missing as a result of the Katyn massacre (1940), unknown at that time to the Poles. The Soviets did not want citizens of the Second Polish Republic who were not ethnic Poles (such as Jews, Belarusians and Ukrainians) to be eligible for recruitment. The newly established military units did not receive proper logistical support or supplies. Some administrators of Soviet camps holding the Poles interfered with the already authorized release of their Polish inmates.

After the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (August‚ÄìSeptember 1941), Stalin agreed on 18 March 1942 to evacuate part of the Polish formation as a military force to Iran, and the soldiers transferred across the Caspian Sea to the port of Pahlavi in Iran. Eventually all the soldiers and civilians gathered were allowed to leave the Soviet Union and to enter British-controlled territories.  Under British command  Polish war cemetery in Tehran More military personnel and civilians were transferred later that summer, up to the end of August, by ship and by an overland route from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan to the railhead in Mashhad, Iran. Thousands of former Polish prisoners walked from the southern border of the Soviet Union to Iran. Many died in the process due to cold weather, hunger, and exhaustion. About 79,000 soldiers and 37,000 civilians ‚Äì Polish citizens ‚Äì left the Soviet Union.Czes≈Çaw Brzoza, Andrzej Leon Sowa, Historia Polski 1918‚Äì1945 [History of Poland: 1918‚Äì1945], p. 531.

Jewish soldiers and civilians  The memorial in Jerusalem When Anders' Army left the Soviet Union on its journey towards the Middle East, families of the soldiers and groups of Jewish children, war orphans, joined the Jewish soldiers. After arriving in Tehran, Iran, the children were transferred into the hands of the emissaries who brought them to Palestine. Central in obtaining permission for Jewish groups to cross the Iraqi border - permission that had initially been denied - were individuals like Polish Red Cross worker Halina Dmochowska, and prayers were later said for her in various synagogues in Palestine. When Anders' Army reached Palestine, of its over four thousand Jewish soldiers three thousand left the army.Halik Kochanski (2012). The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War, pp. 197‚Äì198. Of the Jewish officers and men in Anders' Army who fought in the Italian campaign, 28 were killed and 62 were wounded. 136 of Anders' Jewish soldiers were decorated, including 6 Jews who received the Order of the \\"Virtuti Militari\\", the highest Polish Military Decoration for Gallantry. In Italy, Jewish and ethnic Polish soldiers of Anders' Amy fought alongside Jewish soldiers in British units, including the Jewish Brigade of the British Eighth Army.

The genes in this region regulate the mating type of the organism and therefore determine key events in its life cycle, such as whether it will reproduce sexually or asexually. In fission yeast such as S. pombe, the formation and maintenance of the heterochromatin organization is regulated by RNA-induced transcriptional silencing, a form of RNA interference responsible for genomic maintenance in many organisms.Noma K, Sugiyama T, Cam H, Verdel A, Zofall M, Jia S, Moazed D, Grewal S (2004). \\"RITS acts in cis to promote RNA interference-mediated transcriptional and post- transcriptional silencing\\".

Mating-type switching In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type is determined by two non-homologous alleles at the mating-type locus. S. cerevisiae has the capability of undergoing mating-type switching, that is conversion of some haploid cells in a colony from one mating-type to the other. Mating-type switching can occur as frequently as once every generation. Switching involves homologous recombinational repair of a site specific, programmed double-strand break, a highly organized process.Haber JE.

It focuses on project-based learning, student-centered culture, college and workforce readiness, and technology integration. It is the flagship school of the New Tech Network, a school design organization with nearly 200 schools in the United States and Australia.  History  In 1991, Vincent Butler began working on the concept for a high school designed to prepare students for the workforce. Butler began working with the Napa Valley Unified School District, who were looking to relieve crowding in Napa High School and Vintage High School. In 1996, New Technology High School was opened as a two-year, 11th - 12th grade only, school of 240 students, and was officially established the next year. During the first few years of the school's operation, educators from across the United States grew interested in the model. In 2000, the New Tech Network was established to support similar schools, and quickly received grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. By 2005, New Tech had expanded to a four-year high school, with a wait list for prospective students. Vincent Butler left the board of New Technology High School in 2006, severing the school's ties to the business community. However, New Tech continued its focus on college and career readiness.  Design  New Technology High School is designed to teach students the skills to thrive in college and future careers. This is accomplished through the use of Project- based learning in all classrooms. Technology, such as computers and the Internet, is heavily utilized, including New Tech Network's Learning Management System, Echo. In addition, students are made familiar with computer programming, digital design, and animation. Alongside the methods of teaching in the classroom, skills are taught through requirements outside of the high school. All students are required to take 12 transferable units through Napa Valley College. Several college classes are held on the New Tech campus each semester. Further graduation requirements include an internship related to the career a student wishes to pursue, 30 hours of school and community service, and the completion of a digital portfolio showcasing a student's work over four years.  School Culture  New Tech fosters a student-led culture. The design of the learning method trusts students to regulate themselves and their learning. Without bells or hall passes, the campus is run somewhat like a college or workplace. Students are also trusted to run the school in some capacity, with the student-elected government allotting funds to clubs and making and modifying rules. This culture of trust, respect, and responsibility gives New Tech its motto. = La Strada = Artists at New Technology High School's La Strada, 2018 La Strada dell' Arte is an annual community festival hosted by New Technology High School. The students showcase their year's work, raise funds for clubs, and exhibit art and music. A chalk art competition is open to both students and local artists, including many New Tech graduates. La Strada began in 2006 and was originally a student-lead gallery of Project Based Learning at the Copia. Although La Strada was a success, there was a brief cancellation in 2009 due to financial issues, and the festival was relocated in 2010 to the New Tech campus.  Center for Excellence  Since its inception, New Technology High School has hosted over 20,000 visitors from around the globe in its Center for Excellence.

The fourth named storm, second hurricane, and the only major hurricane on the season, Debby developed near the north coast of Hispaniola from a westward moving tropical wave on September 13\\\\. Forming as a tropical depression, it headed northwestward, and eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Debby the following day. Thereafter, Debby rapidly intensified into a hurricane early on September 15\\\\. The hurricane then curved northeastward and grazed Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane on September 16\\\\. It continued to strengthen, and by September 18, Debby briefly peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, with winds at 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg). After reaching peak intensity, Debby slowly weakened, and was between Category 2 and 1 when it passed south of Newfoundland early on September 19\\\\. Thereafter, the storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60 mph (95 km/h) towards the east. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September 20, shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact was minor in the Lesser Antilles, with only light to moderate rainfall in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. On Bermuda, high winds caused some power outages and knocked over trees, though damage on the island was minimal. In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland. Meteorological history A weather system moved off the coast of Africa on September 3\\\\. The disturbance was small and became unidentifiable within 24 hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September 7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September 11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September 13 near the Dominican Republic. The next Reconnaissance aircraft that investigated the system discovered a minimal pressure of 1005 mbar (28.67 inHg) and winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) in the depression's center, prompting an upgrade to Tropical Storm Debby on the morning of September 14\\\\. Uncertainty arose as to whether Debby would interact with an approaching trough or enter the influence of a ridge over the southeastern United States. The storm was later picked up by the trough, moving away from land and moved to the north. Debby strengthened further, becoming a minimal hurricane late on September 14\\\\. The hurricane deepened further, reaching maximum winds of 110 mph (180 km/h), a Category 2 storm. Debby approached Bermuda in this time, and on September 16, Debby passed 80 miles (130 km) west of the island and continued north. Hurricane Debby intensifying in the north Atlantic on September 17 Debby began to slow down to 5 mph (10 km/h) early on September 17 as another trough in the westerlies arrived and the system entered it. As the hurricane entered the trough, its forward speed picked up from 5 mph (10 km/h) to 30 mph (50 km/h). During this time, Debby reached Category 4 strength, reaching a peak intensity of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimal pressure of 950 mbar (28.05 inHg). Early on September 19, Debby passed just south of Cape Race, Newfoundland and started accelerating to the east at 60 mph (100 km/h) on the following day. Debby remained a tropical cyclone while crossing the North Atlantic Ocean and weakened to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC September 20\\\\. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September 20 shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remains of Debby maintained plenty of intensity over northern Europe, and on September 21 it struck northern parts of Finland (where it was named storm Mauri) as one of the most powerful windstorms in the country's recorded history. Winds over 90 mph (145 km/h) felled millions of cubic miles of forest, and a storm surge severely damaged the cities of Kemi and Tornio, claiming two lives. Starting in the 1982 season (with Debby), the Hurricane Hunter Aircraft (also known as P-3s) began running a new mission for NOAA's Hurricane Research Division. The mission was to drop dropwindsondes that deployed very-low Omega frequency signals. These signals were to estimate the sonde's motion compared to the aircraft in certain areas in a storm. Preparations and impact Debby rainfall Rainfalls from Debby in Puerto Rico ranged between around the northern end of the island to in the southern ridge of the island. Rains on the island peaked at 12.86 inches (326 mm) in Penuelas. The U.S. Virgin Islands reported rain of about , while about of precipitation fell in Dominican Republic. The United States Navy removed its 700 personnel on Bermuda's Air Force Base, placing them in a gymnasium nearby. Thousands of tourists took last-minute flights out of Bermuda on September 16 as Debby drew near. Some of the airlines had pulled back the number of flights going in and out of the island. Eastern Airlines dropped from five flights to two, with them going to only New York City, Newark, New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts. The storm had sustained winds of 110 mph (180 km/h) winds, and forecasters were predicting that the hurricane's eye would be over the island the next day. Airlines canceled flights, buildings boarded up, and cruise liners were hurried out of their harbors in the time before Debby arrived. Rescue teams evacuated workers from Mobil oil rigs in Debby's path as it neared. Bermuda experienced heavy gusts of wind, which caused minor damage with no injuries or fatalities. Power outages were reported on the island, though electricity was quickly restored. Numerous trees were knocked down on the island due to high winds. As the storm was approaching Canada, some oil rigs offshore of Newfoundland were evacuated and a science expedition off Grand Banks was discontinued. Onshore, Debby produced light rainfall in the southeastern portions of Newfoundland, with precipitation peaking at approximately . In addition, a few areas experienced tropical storm forces winds, though damage was minimal.

His main area of interest and expertise was in the field of civil liberties/civil rights, and he did the bulk of his writing while on the faculty of Dartmouth College. Carr also served as the executive secretary of President Harry S. Truman's Committee on Civil Rights and was the primary author of the committee's landmark report, To Secure These Rights (1947), which spotlighted the need for more rigorous federal enforcement of civil rights. He served as president of Oberlin College from 1960‚Äì1970.  Biography  Carr was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, and graduated from that city's legendary Shaw High School. While in high school, he made a living by trapping. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1929, and then did his graduate work at Harvard University, earning an M.A. in 1930 and a Ph.D. in 1935. While completing his doctoral studies, Carr taught at the University of Oklahoma Norman. He joined the department of government at Dartmouth in 1937 and remained there until 1960. Carr served as the president of Oberlin College during a tumultuous period of student activism. Under his presidency, he increased the school's physical plant, with 15 new buildings completed. Under his leadership, student involvement in college affairs increased, with students serving on nearly all college committees as voting members (including the Board of Trustees). Despite these accomplishments, Carr clashed repeatedly with the students regarding issues related to the Vietnam War. He left office in 1969, with History professor Ellsworth C. Carlson taking over as acting President, and was forced to resign as President in November 1970, succeeded by the 33-year-old Oberlin & Princeton alumnus Robert W. Fuller.

He represented the 38th Senate District. Anderson is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), serving as California state leader.Anderson profile , alec.org; accessed July 8, 2014. Early life and family Anderson graduated from Grossmont Community College, with an Associate's degree in business administration. He attended California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and received a Bachelor's degree in finance and business administration from the university. He has served within his community as treasurer on the board of the Resource Conservation District of Greater San Diego County, a member of the board of the Water Conservation Garden, director of proceedings of the Alpine Chamber of Commerce, and as a volunteer at River Valley Charter High School. Anderson is married to Kate, and they have three children. In 2010 the family resided in Alpine, California. Joel Anderson and his family in 2006 Political career =San Diego activism= In 1998, Anderson campaigned for a seat in the California Assembly but lost the election. In November 2002, he was elected to the Division 5 seat on the Padre Dam Board--representing Blossom Valley, Flinn Springs, Alpine, Crest and Harbison Canyon--with 44 percent of the vote while campaigning on the issues of fiscal responsibility and decreasing spending. Anderson criticized incumbent members of the board for excessive travel and for putting together a customer service center that cost more than he believed was necessary. After Anderson was elected, the Padre Dam Board voted unanimously to postpone the building project. In August 2003, the Padre Dam Board voted to build a new office building at the Santee Lakes Recreation Preserve; Anderson voted against the spending measure, and it passed 3‚Äì2 with a cost limit of $6 million. In 2006, Anderson was the Board President of the Padre Dam Water Board. =California Assembly= Anderson was elected to the California Assembly in 2006, as a representative of the 77th Assembly District in East San Diego County, California. His campaign issues included border security, combating illegal immigration, decreasing taxes and fighting government waste, and promoting Jessica's Law in order to prevent sex offenders residing nearby educational facilities and local parks. He received endorsements in his 2006 campaign, from Republican politicians in San Diego County including Ray Haynes, State Senator Bill Morrow, and Assemblyman Mark Wyland. Helped by those endorsements, he narrowly won a five-candidate primary over Santee City Councilman Jack Dale by 858 votes, which was tantamount to victory in the general election. Joel Anderson with Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007 In 2007, Anderson wrote legislation in the California Assembly which mandated that the two main pension funds in the state must divest from businesses that conduct defense or energy affairs in Iran. The bill required the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System to divest from companies that violated federal law by doing business in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This legislation called for the divestment of more than $24 billion of our public pensions from the Islamic Republic of Iran. This proposal garnered Anderson notice on a national level. AB 221, the California Divest Iran Act, was co- authored by fellow legislators from both main political parties. The bill focused on the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), and ordered them to divest from businesses in Iran. Governor Schwarzenegger spoke favorably of Anderson's legislation, and acknowledged that the state should position itself to have a \\"powerful stand against terrorism\\". In a statement about AB 221, the Governor said, \\"California has a long history of leadership and doing what's right with our investment portfolio.\\" Governor Schwarzenegger said he would sign AB 221 on the floor of the United Nations during his speech to the General Assembly. Sherry Reser, spokeswoman for CalSTRS said that the pension fund \\"will never tolerate support of terrorism\\", and acknowledged, \\"We will implement the bill.\\" James Hawley, co-director of the Elfenworks Center for the Study of Fiduciary Capitalism at St. Mary's College in Moraga, California, predicted that Anderson's legislation would affect other state governments, \\"There is political pressure out there. This is going to resonate with a lot of state legislatures.\\" Anderson's bill received support from both Jewish and Iranian groups in California. Associated Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Rabbi Abraham Cooper commented, \\"The Iranian regime is up to no good. The only thing that is going to derail them is to hit them in the pocketbook.\\" Upon news that the Governor would sign the bill, Anderson stated, \\"This is a common sense bill. Money is the mother's milk of terrorism.\\" Anderson proposed legislation in 2007 to give disabled veterans a free pass to attend state parks. The bill passed the Assembly with a 73-0 vote. Democratic State Senator Christine Kehoe commented in favor of the legislation, \\"It's the public's way of saying thank you.\\" Vietnam War veteran and Dana Point, California resident Bill Manes noted, \\"It's just a nice gesture, particularly for those men and women coming back now.\\" Anderson put forth an amendment intended to give the same parks benefit to those that had received the Medal of Honor. State Senator Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat and the Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee, commented in favor of this amendment, \\"I'm certainly in favor of extending the privilege to recipients of the Medal of Honor. That makes complete sense.\\" On July 27, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the legislation into law, as Senate Bill 60. Upon signing the bill, Governor Schwarzenegger stated, \\"We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude for the contributions they have made to our state and for their dedicated service to our country. This bill is an important step forward in ensuring that these homes become a reality for our many veterans who need them.\\" In March 2008, Anderson endorsed Duncan D. Hunter, the son of Congressman Duncan Hunter, in his campaign for the United States House of Representatives. Anderson also served as the chairman of the junior Hunter's congressional campaign. Anderson and his daughter Mary spoke up in support of home schooling in March 2008, after a state appellate court in California issued a ruling that children who are the product of home schooling need to be credentialed. Anderson proposed legislation in the Assembly, ACR 115, which requested of the California Supreme Court to overturn the precedent of the lower court. In 2008, Anderson brought the issue of divestment of funding from businesses related to Iran to the educational institution of the University of California. He brought forward a resolution, ACR 79, which called upon the university to divest its funding and investments relating to any corporations that conduct business operations with Iran. In May 2008, the resolution had successfully passed through the Assembly Appropriations Committee. Anderson commented, \\"as a matter of human rights, it is the right thing to do\\" to divest from Iran, and also noted it was a fiscally responsible decision. In 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two bills proposed by Anderson into state law: a piece of legislation which assisted home-schooled children in getting work permits, and another bill that protected some of an individual's equity in their home from liability. In February 2009, Anderson proposed legislation, AB-255, that would mandate blurring detail on Google Earth images of areas deemed sensitive locations including schools, places of worship, government buildings and medical facilities. When asked how he had determined the list of locations proposed to be blurred, Anderson commented, \\"Well, I looked at where we've had security issues in the past and potentially, might have issues in the future. Churches and synagogues have been bombed. So have federal buildings and then, of course, 9/11. So, the threats are out there and as a state legislator, public safety is my No. 1 job. To ignore that fact would be irresponsible.\\" In March 2009, Anderson opposed a non-binding resolution that declared the process flawed by which Proposition 8, which had made same-sex marriage unconstitutional in California, was adopted, and described same-sex marriage as discriminatory towards heterosexual marriage. Anderson received a zero percent scorecard rating from gay rights group Equality California for the years 2007 through 2012. Anderson introduced legislation in 2009 regarding a concern over California's use of IOUs: AB 1506 proposed to allow individuals to utilize California state issued IOUs in order to fund payments towards university education, car payments, and payroll taxes. Anderson said of the proposed legislation, \\"Hopefully, this will allow California businesses to stay alive while the state is unable to pay them.\\" The bill would mandate that the state must accept its own registered warrants as payment. The bill was considered by the Assembly Business and Professions Committee in July 2009. The bill received unanimous support from the Assembly Business and Professions Committee, as well as bipartisan support from both Republicans and from Democrats in the majority. Democratic leadership member in the Assembly, John Perez, commented favorably on Anderson's proposed legislation, \\"It is the recipients of these IOUs who are being punished for the actions of the governor and others who have gotten us into this situation. I appreciate what you're attempting to do here.\\" After the July 7, 2009 vote by the Assembly Business and Professions Committee, the bill was sent to the Appropriations Committee. Dr. Stuart A. Cohen, president of the San Diego County Medical Society, wrote to Anderson in support of the legislation, acknowledging, \\"This bill would save many businesses and individuals from severe financial hardship.\\" Anderson was the only Assembly member to vote against AB2199, which would remove \\"the causes and cures of homosexuality\\" from the list of mental illnesses and sexual deviancies to be researched by the State Department of Mental Health. In an August 2009 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Anderson identified private sector growth as a solution to decreasing unemployment and fixing the budget in California, and noted, \\"The long-term answer to the budget is to grow private-sector jobs as quickly as possible while stopping all new spending. My colleagues and I are committed to rolling back high taxes and oppressive regulation on businesses, thus encouraging new private-sector jobs.\\" He characterized \\"a clean spending cap [as] the single most important reform for California that could be passed in a ballot initiative\\". On September 12, 2009, Anderson was recognized at a gala event \\"Night To Honor Israel\\" with the \\"Watchman on the Wall\\" Award from the organization Christians United for Israel. The organization recognized Anderson as the Assemblyman, \\"who spearheaded California's Iran Divestment initiative\\". In December 2009, Anderson was fined US$20,000 by the Fair Political Practices Commission in California, relating to solicitations of contributions towards a campaign higher than the legally allowed amount. In an interview about the fine, Anderson stated, \\"I made the mistakes, and I corrected them as quickly as possible. We didn't spend the money. Once I realized there was a mistake, we went straight to the FPPC and tried to reconcile it.\\" =California State Senate= On March 3, 2010, Anderson announced his intention to run for the California State Senate seat. Other candidates in the Republican primary election included Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force retired Lieutenant Colonel and Murrieta, California school board member Kenneth Dickson, and Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone. In a statement upon declaring his intention to run for California State Senate, Anderson noted, \\"Over the last three years I've carried major legislation. I've worked hard in a bipartisan way to solve California's problems. We have solutions to California's problems, but they aren't all politically correct. I want to be part of that solution.\\" In the Republican primary for the State Senate, Anderson received endorsements from San Diego Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, the California Republican Assembly, Congressman Duncan Hunter, the San Diego Deputy Sheriff's Association, Assembly member Martin Garrick, and San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith. On June 8, 2010, the day of the Republican primary for the State Senate seat, the Associated Press reported: \\"Assemblyman Joel Anderson, R-La Mesa, was the early leader to succeed Senate Minority Leader Dennis Hollingsworth\\". The Press-Enterprise noted, \\"Assemblyman Joel Anderson, R-Alpine, was on pace to top a four-person field in the GOP primary for the 36th Senate District\\". The North County Times reported that Anderson led the candidates in the Republican primary, with his closest opponent receiving 24 percent of the vote. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Anderson had a \\"strong lead over his Republican competitors in the East County 36th State Senate District primary race\\". According to the paper, with 15 percent of votes counted, Anderson received 45 percent of the votes; other candidates in the Republican primary received 25, 21, and 10 percent. East County Magazine, and The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Anderson the winner of the Republican primary in the State Senate election. In an error compared to \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\", the publication Valley News of Riverside County, California, erroneously reported that Anderson had lost the primary. The publisher of Valley News had only obtained the results from Riverside, and not the entire district. The Valley News later posted a new article with the correct results, and deleted the prior incorrect reporting without posting a correction. The State Senate district is considered a \\"Republican stronghold\\"; the Democratic candidate in the general election was Paul Clay, who ran uncontested in the primary. Anderson won the general election by a wide margin. During his term in the Senate, he has opposed any legislation controlling the sale of guns or ammunition. He opposed increased aid to pregnant teens, voted to prevent registered nurses from dispensing contraceptives, and wanted to prevent the inclusion of maternity services in health insurance plans sold in the state. He voted against the minimum wage increase more than once, he opposed requiring overtime pay for agricultural workers, opposes health warning labels on sugary drinks, opposed the sale of medical marijuana, opposed notifying property owners prior to the start of hydraulic fracking on their leased lands, voted not to ban the carcinogen BPA in baby products, voted against requiring mental health coverage by health insurers doing business in the state, voted against the solar power energy credit, voted to keep gender based health insurance pricing so that women would have to pay more for health insurance, and voted to allow the resale of recalled products. He also voted against changing school start times, a statewide sanctuary policy, and recognizing non-binary as a legal gender. On June 1, 2017, he voted against a bill to create a single-payer health plan for the state of California. =Sexual Harassment Reprimand= In August of 2018, Anderson was accused of physically and verbally harassing her at a fund raising event for the California Nurses Association. Stephanie Roberson, the association‚Äôs Government Relations Director, complained to the Anderson, who was intoxicated, he repeatedly threatened to \\"bitch slap\\" her. witnessed by several people, Anderson was escorted off the premises by restaurant staff. In September 2018 he was officially reprimanded by the for sexually harassing a lobbyist for the California Nurses Association. =Controversial bill condemning China= On July 20, 2017 Sen. Anderson's introduced Resolution SJR-10, a resolution condemning the persecution of Falun Gong taking place in the People's Republic of China to the Committee of Rules. It unanimously passed a vote of the Judiciary Committee on August 29. On August 30, members of the senate received a letter on the stationary of the Chinese Consulate of San Francisco urging the California senators not to support SJR-10, \\"so as not to sabotage the friendship and sustainable development between California and China.\\" The letter goes further, pointing out the strong economic ties between China and California, such as the high volume of tourism, trade, and overseas students studying in California. The following day, September 1, the resolution was voted on and sent back to the rules committee, blocking it from being voted on in the Senate. =Board of Equalization= On February 1, 2018, Anderson announced that he will be a candidate for the California Board of Equalization, district 4. In a major surprise, he was narrowly defeated by former San Diego City Councilman Mike Schaefer.https://www.escondidograpevine.com/2018/11/30/joel-anderson-turns- into-political-punchline/ =San Diego County Board of Supervisors= On February 26, 2020, Anderson announced that he would be a candidate for the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/politics/joel-anderson- board-of-supervisors/ In the March 3 primary, Anderson finished first place with 35.5% of the vote. In the November runoff, he will face Poway Mayor Steve Vaus, who finished in second place with 31% of the vote.https://www.livevoterturnout.com/SanDiego/LiveResults/en/Index_8.html Electoral history ;2010 primary, Republican party, California State Senate (SD 36) *Joel Anderson (R), 45.2% *Jeff Stone (R), 26.1% *Kenneth C.

It is one of Bruce Lee's most famous signature moves, and an international federation of gyms have been named after the technique. The technique operates on the principle of using a sustained offense as a means of forcing an opponent to move on the defensive. The move consists of putting both fists perpendicularly above one another and moving them in a circular motion (starting forward and downward) in a tight formation with fists kept facing forward bent at the wrist outward and clenched vertically, compounded with running toward an opponent. This is intended to throw off the opponent while effectively dealing a barrage of centrifugally forced punches toward the center of the opponent's mass. A poorly executed or premature straight blast attack can usually be effectively countered by one or more kicks to the attacker's shin, knee, or groin. In some of his books, Bruce Lee mentions how boxers would scoff at this 'funny' looking technique, but when they were not expecting it in sparring matches, they would take the brunt of the attack, be thrown off guard and defeated.

The album was released October 6, 1998 on Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Marty Stuart and Justin Niebank. The album consists mostly of songs co-written by Smith. It was her first album in 20 years, since 1978's New Horizons. Nonetheless, it attracted little attention.  Background  Connie Smith was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee and contained ten tracks of previously unrecorded material. Nine out of the ten tracks on the album were co-written by Connie Smith, who had previously never written an entire album. Allmusic album reviewer, Thom Jurek called the album's sound to be \\"tough traditional honky tonk music with an edge that makes it very attractive as a rock & roll record.\\" The opening track, \\"How Long\\" was co-written with Marty Stuart and Harlan Howard. Jurek called the opening of the fourth track, \\"You Can't Back a Teardrop\\" (the only song on the album not co-written by Smith) to resemble that of Ray Price's \\"Crazy Arms,\\" however he went on to say the rest of the song was different from \\"Crazy Arms\\" because, \\"it's on the far honky tonk edge, with Stuart leading the band in a driving, rollicking shuffle where fiddles drive a pedal steel ever toward the center of the pathos in the center of the bridge.\\" Smith herself called the album's ninth track, \\"When It Comes to You\\" to resemble that of a rock and roll song, stating that she, \\"yodeled on the end just to be funny, and they kept it in.\\" The ninth track also featured Stuart playing mandolin. The second track, \\"Lonesome\\" was also written by Smith and Stuart and was said to resemble, \\"a bluegrass ghost song about love in the ether,\\" according to Jurek. The closing song on the album, \\"A Tale from Taharrie\\" is departure from any of the other tracks on the album, as it resembles a Celtic song, according to Smith, stating, \\"We wanted to write a song that sounded like the 1700s. It came out sounding Irish. I made up the name \\"Taharrie\\" because it fit the sound.\\"  Critical reception  Connie Smith mainly received positive reviews upon its release. Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the album four out five stars, giving the album's quality much praise, saying, \\"In all, this is not only a solid effort; it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer.\\" Jurek went on to give it praise, saying, \\"Connie Smith is a bona fide country and gospel music legend; she is quite literally the only person who deserves to share a reputation with Patsy Cline -- Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn notwithstanding.\\" Slipcue.com also praised the effort, calling it, \\"a pretty fair comeback album.\\" The website further gave credit to producer, Marty Stuart for making, \\"appropriate decisions about how to frame her vocals.\\" The website made a positive conclusion about the album, stating, \\"This album varies; basically it's not bad when she tackles upbeat material -- mainly Texas shuffles -- and it founders on the slow and sentimental numbers. If you're a fan, it's definitely worth checking out.\\" It was also briefly reviewed the book, Country Music: The Rough Guide, which called the effort, \\"a solid fiddle-and-guitar country that's far gutsier than anything in the Garth- and-Reba mainstream.

Birnaviridae currently consists of three genera. The first genus is Entomobirnavirus, which contains DXV. The next genus is Aquabirnavirus, containing infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The last genus is Avibirnavirus, which contains infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). All of these genera contain homology in three specific areas of their transcripts. The homology comes from the amino and carboxyl regions of preVP2, a small 21-residue-long domain near the carboxyl terminal of VP3, and similar small ORFs sequences. DXV was named after Drosophila melanogaster, where it was first isolated. DXV was first isolated and named in 1978. DXV was discovered as a contaminant in adult D. melanogaster while studying rhabdoviruses. Assay results of DXV showed that DXV induces sensitivity to both carbon dioxide and NH2, which suggests general anoxia. Therefore, the pathogenic pathway for DXV leads to anoxia sensitivity and death of D. melanogaster. By negative contrast electron microscopy the DXV components were first visualized. The origin of DXV is unknown and unclear. It was thought that DXV could have been pre- existent in Drosophila broods in a non-pathogenic form. Additionally, it was speculated that DXV might have originated as a contaminant from fetal calf serum in infection type studies because it was documented that endogenous bovine viruses were already in fetal calf serum. Structure, genome, and replication Drosophila X virus genome has two segments: segment A & segment B. DXV is a Baltimore Class III naked (non-enveloped) virus. The capsid of this protein contains an icosahedral geometry (T=13) consisting of 260 trimeric VP2 capsomeres. Specifically, DXV contains a bi-segmented dsRNA genome. Both segments of the DXV genome contain 5‚Äô terminal GGA triplet and a 3‚Äô terminal CCC triplet consensus, which is consistent with birnaviridae (Shwed, 2002). The segment A genome is 3360-bp in length. Segment A encodes a polyprotein sequence as follows: NH2-preVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH. This segment contains a large and small ORF. The segment B genome is 2991-bp in length. Segment B encodes a polypeptide sequence as follows: NH2-VP1-COOH. The 5‚Äô UTR of segment B is homologous to segment A, but unlike segment A, there is only one ORF. Unusually, VP1 can be in two forms; as a free RdRp and as the genome- liked protein (VpG) that attaches to both 5‚Äô end segments of the DXV through a Ser-5‚Äô-GMP phosphodiester bond. The replication of DXV follows the characterized dsRNA virus replication cycle. The large ORF of segment A consists of 3069 nucleotides. The UTRs are characterized as 107-bp on 5‚Äô side and 157-bp on 3‚Äô end. The start codons can be at either position 102, or two codons downstream at position 108. However, the initiation codon starts at the 108-bp. The translation of the large ORF transcript produces a 114-kDa polyprotein. The mature VP4 protein, viral protease, assists this process to increase the processing of the polyprotein to generate preVP2 capsid protein, VP3 viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and additional VP4 proteins. In addition VP3 proteins can associate with pre-VP2 as a structural protein and with VP1 to function as a transcriptional activator. The small ORF of segment A consists of 711 nucleotides. This ORF is in a location that extends across VP4/VP3 junction, although the precise position is unknown. The mechanism for transcribing the small ORF is unknown. However, the possibility of ribosomal frameshifting has been ruled out since the small ORF site does not contain the characteristic hallmarks, such the 7 nucleotide long ‚Äúslippery sequence‚Äù or downstream pseudoknot that is seen in other members of Birnaviridae. It is hypothesized the small ORF is translated in a mechanism that uses subgenomic transcripts. In any case, the translation of the small ORF transcript produces a 27-kDa polypeptide. This polypeptide consists of 28 of basic, mainly arginine, residues. However this polypeptide has not been detected in infected cells. The segment B transcript encodes it encodes a 112.8-kDa VP1 polypeptide once translated. This polypeptide has been characterized to be the RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the VpG. This polypeptide is 977 amino acids in length, making it the largest encoded RdRp in the Birnaviridae family. The RdRp contains a consensus GTP-binding site and is thought to contain self-guanylylation activity, making it consistent with the Birnaviridae RdRp capacity. Tropism Currently, DXV does not infect vertebrates. It is known that invertebrates, such as insects, are hosts for DXV, but their specific tissue tropism is not known for certain. Tracheal cells were thought to be a possible target because there is evidence that Drosophila flies that are infected by DXV suffered from lack of oxygen supply to their tissues, which eventually leads to death. Based on previous studies, DXV was unsuccessfully cultured in vertebrate cells lines and mouse brain. Genetic variability It has not been shown yet that DXV naturally infects Drosophila flies therefore; there are no wild-type strains of DXV. The Culex Y virus (CYV) is a tentative member of the genus that DXV is in. It has been proposed that CYV could act as a wild-type counterpart in studies that rely on DXV. In addition, the Espirito Santo virus (ESV) is defined as a sister species to DXV. This particular virus, ESV, was observed in an Aedes albopictus cell culture, which was obtained from a patient's serum infected with DENV-2. A difference between the ESV and CYV would be CYV's ability to independently replicate without on other viruses in insect cell culture. A non-AUG start codon in ORF5 has been shown in Drosophila and may regulate translation, which indicates its function in entomobirnavirus host in reactions. When ORF5 is expressed, it is thought to mediate ribosomal frameshifting. A heptanucleotide that is located upstream of ORF (1897UUUUUUA) is found in both ESV and DXV. Together with phylogenetic analysis and the location differences of nucleotide and amino acids between CYV and ESV, it has been shown that CYV and ESV is one sister species to DXV. Research Although widely used in the laboratory, DXV has never been found as a natural infection of Drosophila, and was originally identified in laboratory cell culture. DXV can infect fruit flies of the genus Drosophila and is commonly used to study innate immunity in the common model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The virus is also often used to study RNA interference as a mechanism of viral immunity in Drosophila. DXV was a contaminant that was isolated in infectious studies with a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, the Sigma virus. Since then, DXV has been widely used in research and has significantly contributed to the current knowledge of insect specific immune system. Infection studies with DXV has shed light on the innate immune response and RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila flies. Additionally, using DXV in Drosophila showed that RNAi is a major form of an antiviral effector mechanism. In regards to the Toll pathway in antiviral response, there is evidence to show this pathway inhibits DXV replication in Drosophila. Furthermore, findings from DXV research on Drosophila significantly influenced studies on the dengue virus (DENV) to learn more about its innate immune response toward infections. It has been shown that DENV is controlled by RNAi in Drosophila cells and studies revealed that DENV's interaction with RNAi are just as vital as siRNAs. Engineered transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitos were shown to have resistance (caused by an RNAi response) against DENV-2 infections.

As of 2004, the estimated population was 350. Geography The town sits approximately two miles southwest of the intersection of Farm Road 217 and Farm Road 182. The Middle Bosque River flows through the center of town while Goldy's Branch flows just north of town; the two branches come together less than a half mile east of the community and continue east-southeast to Lake Waco. History Turnersville was founded in the 1860s. The Chisholm Trail and Bosque Trail historically passed through the area. The Lone Tree, one of the oldest landmarks in Coryell County, located two miles east of the townsite, helped to guide travelers, settlers, and cattle drivers to a spring-fed water supply on the open prairie; it still stood as of 2004. The town that eventually developed at this spring, where all travelers camped, was named after Cal Turner, a blacksmith who settled there to shoe horses and repair wagons. His blacksmith shop was the first business in town. By 1868, the original Presbyterian church also served the community as a school. A post office opened in Turnersville in 1875. The first postmaster was Joseph M. Black, who later donated five acres of land for a cemetery. In 1885, Turnersville had a population of 300, served by a school, three churches, a gristmill, a cotton gin, and eight other businesses. A Masonic lodge was established the same year. The town's economy was based primarily on shipping grain and cotton. Turnersville prospered from 1895 to around 1916, largely because of the local cotton economy. Throughout the 20th century, however, the Turnersville population steadily declined. In 1916, it had 162 residents, numerous churches, and some ten businesses, and was home to a local newspaper known as the Advance. The school was closed in 1968 and the post office in 1987, but a new fire station was built in 1988. By 1989, the town reported 155 residents and four businesses. Today, Turnersville still has an active cemetery association, which sponsors an annual homecoming on the Sunday before Memorial Day. The town is still home to a seed and fertilizer company, a construction company, a grain elevator, a community center, several local farms and ranches, and the last active church in town, the Baptist Church. Schoolchildren from Turnersville currently attend either the Jonesboro ISD or the Gatesville ISD. There is an active mission to renovate the community center and the old high school building. The 1916 Turnersville Elementary School was acquired and leveled in order to move forward with the next phase of this project which now includes a new building of approximately 6000 square feet. The Cemetery was recently designated a historic cemetery. The historic marker reads as follows: Geology Turnersville sits on the Washita geological group. Major formations within the area include Buda limestone, Del Rio clay, and Georgetown limestone, including beds equivalent to Kiamichi clay at the base.

The headwaters descend a relatively steep canyon east of Skyline Boulevard in a tortuous course. Comparison of topographic maps from 1896 and 1939 illustrates the extreme modification in the lower reaches due to urban development from the rapidly expanding population.Topographic Maps of the San Bruno Creek Watershed: 1896 and 1939 The San Bruno Creek watershed was originally settled by a tribe of the Ohlone, and later this locale was part of the Spanish missions' landholdings. A hiking trail winds along San Bruno Creek representing an important link in the San Francisco Bay Trail; in fact, this link is needed to make up for lack of access along a large bay front area occupied exclusively by San Francisco International Airport; thus, the Bay Trail must detour a full two miles inland from the bay to meet the San Bruno Creek Trail.San Francisco Bay Trail in the vicinity of Point San Bruno History Prehistorically the banks of San Bruno Creek were settled by the Buriburi tribe of the Ohlone, who have presumably lived in the area since as early as 2000 BC. One Buriburi settlement has been identified along San Bruno Creek, which may have had a population of 15 to 25 people.City of San Bruno, California Official Site This watershed was first explored by Europeans in 1769 by a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portol√†. Later, more extensive explorations by Bruno Hecate resulted in the naming of San Bruno Creek after St. Bruno of Cologne, the founder of a medieval monastic order. This creek later gave its name to the community. With the establishment of the San Francisco de As√≠s (St. Francis of Assisi) mission, much of the catchment basin became pasture for grazing mission livestock. Following the decline of the missions, the San Bruno Creek watershed became part of Rancho Buri Buri granted to Jos√© de la Cruz S√°nchez, the eleventh Alcalde (mayor) of San Francisco. Dairy farms later became common in much of the area. One of the earliest maps showing San Bruno Creek appeared in 1893, prepared by Andrew Cowper Lawson, professor of geology at the University of California, Berkeley. At that time San Bruno Creek was drawn as sharing headwaters with another creek which drained away from the bay into what is now called Crystal Springs Reservoir.History of the naming of San Andreas Fault and Lake Later development of the reservoir by the city of San Francisco and lower reach urbanization by the city of San Bruno modified greatly the upper and lower reaches of the watercourse. Above the intersection of Interstate 280 and Interstate 380, the creek runs through Crestmoor Canyon and the Crestmoor residential neighborhood, which was the site of the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion and fire. Upper reach The upper of San Bruno Creek is the most rugged and natural reach as the stream winds through steep canyons of about 45 degrees in slope. The underlying geological formation of this upper catchment basin is Pleistocene Colma Formation, which continues eastward in the basin under most of the San Francisco Bay Flood Plain. Principal flows of the creek are within the winter months of November to March, the only season of meaningful rainfall in the Bay Area. Groundwater in the middle to upper basin varies between about , and flows generally eastward toward the Bay. This wooded upper reach watershed consists of a mixed oak woodland with coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, as a dominant species. Other larger plants are the California Bay Laurel and the understory species Toyon. The understory also includes the following wildflowers: evening primrose (Renothera ovata), wild radish (Raphanus satira), wild cucumber (Marah fabaceus), scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), miners lettuce (Montia perfoliata), fillaree (Erodium cicutarium), vetch (Vicia americana), sweet clover (Melilotus indius), lupine (Lupinus sp.), and California poppy (Eschscholzia californica).

It has 3,951 inhabitants (2019). Geography O≈õno Lubuskie is located near the river ≈Åƒôcza and the lake Reczynek. It is located in the historic Lubusz Land. History Gothic Saint James church In the Early Middle Ages the area was inhabited by Lubuszanie, one of the Polish tribes, and in the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under the Piast dynasty. In the early Piast period, a fortified settlement existed nearby the present-day town and the area formed part of the Lubusz castellany within the Kingdom of Poland until the mid-13th century. O≈õno Lubuskie was mentioned for the first time in 1252, in Latin, as \\"civitas forensi Osna\\". The name is of Slavic origin and is derived from the word osa/osina. The town privileges were received in 1282 from the bishops of Lubusz and the first mayor of the town was Dzier≈ºko of Chyciny. Initially, O≈õno was owned by the Bishops of Lubusz, and since 1258 by the Brandenburg margraves. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the area came under Polish rule again, as part of the Duchy of ≈öcinawa. John, Duke of ≈öcinawa visited the town in 1322.Edward Rymar, Rywalizacja o ziemiƒô lubuskƒÖ i kasztelaniƒô miƒôdzyrzeckƒÖ, \\"≈ölƒÖski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sob√≥tka\\", No. 4/1979, p. 489 (in Polish) The area fell again under Brandenburg suzerainty in the following years and the bishops officially gave the town to Brandenburg in 1401. Prior to 1347 O≈õno received full civic rights and in 1369 it received the right to mint its own coins. Initially it was a fortified trading settlement, but over the time it evolved into a town. From 1373 to 1415 the town was part of the Czech (Bohemian) Crown Lands. In the late Middle Ages O≈õno became the center of the Torzym Land, part of the larger Lubusz Land, and became a county seat in 1447. Polish troops marched through the town in 1657 and in 1674‚Äì1675 Swedish troops were stationed in the town. In 1711 Saxon troops marched through the town and from 1758 to 1760 the town was occupied by Russia. The city was on fire several times and has survived wars and pestilence. Before the war Drossen was famous for its beer produced in the Drossen brewery, flower plantations, as well as its asparagus and currants. During the final stages of World War II, the Germans evacuated the town's populace in January 1945. Due to heavy bombing and battles nearby, the town was left 70% destroyed and on 1 February 1945 it was captured by the Red Army. After Germany's defeat in World War II, the town became part of Poland and was repopulated with Poles, the majority of whom were displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, while some were also former forced laborers returning from Germany, as well as settlers from Romania and central Poland. The historic name O≈õno was restored with the adjective Lubuskie added after the Lubusz Land, in which it is located, to distinguish it from other settlement of the same name. Monuments There are several historical monuments in the town. These include: *The Parish Church of St. Jacob, with its Gothic architecture, dating back to the 14th century. It is the oldest building in the city. *Church belonging to the Nowoapostolski Municipality. *Cemetery chapel of St. Gertrude, late Gothic from the mid-fifteenth century. *Defensive walls from the 15th century.

The concerto is scored for solo piano, flute (third movement only), two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings.  History  Mozart composed the concerto for performance at a series of concerts at the Vienna venues of the Trattnerhof and the Burgtheater in the first quarter of 1784, where he was himself the soloist in March 1784. In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: > \\"I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat > one beats the one in D for difficulty.\\"Hutchings (p. 290) Many pianists consider this to be one of the more difficult of Mozart's piano concertos.Steinberg The concerto is primarily difficult from its many quick scale patterns which must be played perfectly and also from its many fast chord patterns moving up and down. Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \\"grand\\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble.Keefe, Simon P., The Cambridge Companion to Mozart. Cambridge University Press (2003, ), p. 88.  Music  The concerto is in three movements: The first movement is in typical sonata-allegro form. The middle movement consists of a theme and two variations. The finale is (as usual for Mozart) a sonata-rondo, although using a less-common ABACABA form. It is testimony to Mozart's greatness that although this movement is extremely difficult from a technical point of view, it never sounds like a 'showpiece' meant to display the performer's skills. Some of the demands made on the pianist include fast ascending-descending arpeggios, hand-crossing and voice highlighting in runs of semiquavers, wide jumps and towards the end a double-handed tremolo where the soloist 'battles against' the orchestra. This movement is among the most challenging works which Mozart has ever written for the keyboard. Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \\"newly intricate and sophisticated\\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. Elaine Sisman has postulated that Mozart modeled the slow movement on a theme-and-variations movement from the Symphony No. 75 of Joseph Haydn.

In 1730, Antonine monks began using the monastery. In 1750, Bishop Germanus Saqar and the nun Hindiyya al-'Ujaimi used it for the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious order. Finally, in 1779, it came into use by the Maronite church, and in 1830 it became the winter residence of the Lebanon's Maronite Patriarch. The present red roofed structure was built in 1893 during the time of Patriarch John Peter El Hajj. It was designed by Leonard al-Azari. Since its creation around 858 AD, the see of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate has never been in Antioch. Instead, it was originally in Kfarhay in the Batroun mountains, and then continued to move to various locations in the Byblos mountains for the next 500 years, such as Yanouh, Mayfouq, Lehfed, Habeel, Kfifan, al-Kafr, and Hardeen. It then moved to Qannoubine in the Kadisha Valley because of intensified persecution and remained there from 1440 to 1823 when it moved to Dimane and lastly, in 1830, to Bkerk√©.The Maronite Patriarchate Today, Maronite Patriarchs use Dimane as a summer residence and Bkerk√© as a winter one. The monastery was renovated in 1970 by Patriarch Paul Peter Meouchi. Patriarch Anthony Peter Khoraish added the external gate in 1982, and in 1995 Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir built a new wing to house the archives and serve as a museum. He also established tombs for the patriarchs and decorated the church with ornate windows. An old book references a convent, called Kourket, that was likely in this same area, if not on the same site. According to these (likely sensationalized) stories, the convent, founded around 1755, had high death rates, blamed on the air of the region. In 1775, a traveler, who spent the night outside the convent walls, observes a body being secretively buried and tells the local ruler. He sends a contingent of horsemen to gain access to the convent, where they discover \\"abominations which make the hair stand on end\\". The founder of the convent, Hendia, had \\"destroyed her nuns, sometimes to get their property into her hands, at other times, because they showed themselves refractory to her orders...\\". After this discovery, she was jailed and escaped from multiple convents.https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015033911994;view=1up;seq=46;size=175 References External links *Bkerke *History Of Bkerke *Bkerke Court Documents Category:Populated places in Keserwan District Category:History of Lebanon Category:Maronite Church Category:Maronite Church in Lebanon Category:Tourist attractions in Lebanon Category:1703 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Bkerk√©"},{"id":"9434203","text":"Paul Neville may refer to: *Paul Neville (politician) (1940‚Äì2019), Australian politician *Paul Neville (musician), British industrial metal guitarist *Paul Neville (actor) in Full Speed Ahead ","title":"Paul Neville"},{"id":"9434211","text":"The Piano Concerto No. 16 in D major, K. 451, is a concertante work for piano, or pianoforte, and orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Archaeologist Floyd Painter of the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences (now the Chrysler Museum of Art) originally excavated the site in 1955, but it was only conclusively determined to be Henry Town in 2007 by United States Army scientists reviewing the site's artifacts, and no primary source documents exist (save those supposedly held by one now-deceased archaeologist). It was located east of Norfolk, Virginia and north of Chesapeake and south of the Hampton Roads harbor at approximately . The historical and archeological site is immediately north of U.S. Route 60 (Shore Drive) on what is now Lake Joyce, formerly an inlet connecting with Pleasure House Creek, a western branch of the Lynnhaven River, itself an estuary of the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads. The general location of Henry Town Historical and archaeological record Henry Town was first described by name in a 1613 letter by the Colony of Virginia's lieutenant governor, Samuel Argall, who wrote of sending a fishing ship \\"to Henries Towne for the reliefe of such men as were there.\\"Quoted in Mark St. John Erickson. \\"Scientists identify early English settlement: An archaeological study and colonial documents indicate that 'Henries Towne' has been found.\\" Daily Press. 20 January 2007. Accessed 10 February 2007. Other extant documents mention several forts at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay as early as 1610, possibly including Henry Town. These records indicate that settlement at Henry Town was contemporary with that at Virginia's first permanent settlement at Jamestown which was founded in 1607 on the opposite Western Shore of the Bay on the north shore upstream of the James River. Captain John Smith of Jamestown wrote of returning to Cape Henry in 1608 after his crew and a small boat outfitted with a sail had completed their first of several explorations of the coast and length of the Chesapeake Bay, but did not mention why or exactly where. Despite this documentary evidence, most of the archaeological finds at the Henry Town site date from the middle rather than the early 17th century. Although an archaeologist from the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior who oversaw excavations on Jamestown Island and other archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia have earlier dated the finds as early as 1610, others such as the head of the James River Institute for Archaeology and part of the academic team that discovered the original site and remains of the historic Jamestown, the curator of the Jamestown Rediscovery collection, and other regional experts dispute such an early date. A limited 2005 excavation at the site dated nothing earlier than the second quarter of the 17th century. The site's artifacts also contained Dutch and Portuguese pottery fragments that point to later settlement and tobacco pipe pieces that are nearly the same as some from the neighboring colonial Province of Maryland that have been reliably dated to about 1650. Some discoveries suggest that the site is connected to Adam Thoroughgood's nearby tobacco plantation, which dates to about 1635. Contemporary discovery and development Before its identification as Henry Town the site had been called the Lake Joyce site or the Chesopean site. Its discovery in 1955 attracted attention but it was not until a reexamination of the evidence in light of the Samuel Argall letter that the site was identified by an archaeological team based in the Fort Eustis army base in Newport News. The relevance of the settlement to the early history of the English colony in Virginia has given impetus for the recreation of the site. At nearby Cape Henry, east of the Lynnhaven River, the First Landing Foundation will undertake a $700,000 project to build more than a dozen structures as well as an outdoor stage to conduct historical dramas.

Early life Ryen was born Richard Anton Robert Felix Revy in Hungary. He began working in Germany as an actor and later became a well-respected stage director at the Munich Kammerspiele (Munich Chamber Theater). His first movie was the comedy ' followed by a bit part in Must We Get Divorced? (1933) with S. Z. Sakall. Felix made three more movies, Wei√üe Majest√§t, Peer Gynt and Das Erbe von Pretoria (all 1934) in Germany before the Nazi's expelled him. Settles in Hollywood Felix emigrated to Hollywood in October 1938 and changed his name to Ryen. In Hollywood, as was the fate for so many German actors and actresses of that time, like Conrad Veidt, he was mainly cast in Nazi roles, which kept him working during the war years. Working for Warner Bros., his first movie was as an uncredited role as a Nazi radio station manager in the anti-Nazi movie Berlin Correspondent (1942) which starred Dana Andrews. Right after that movie, he received another small role as a German policeman in Desperate Journey starring Ronald Reagan, Errol Flynn and Raymond Massey. He appeared on screen for 15 seconds while he is checking a license plate. Within weeks, at age 56, Ryen obtained the role which resulted in his best remembered performance, that of Colonel Heinze in Casablanca (1942), where he constantly had to tail his superior Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). His scenes took four week to shoot and, at $400 a week, he earned $1,600. After Casablanca, Ryen appeared in 16 more films. His first credited film in America was The Constant Nymph (1943) with Charles Boyer and Joan Fontaine. He played the radio announcer in 20th Century Fox's Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas. Later in the year, Ryen played a Nazi officer in the war drama The Cross of Lorraine with Peter Lorre and Hans Twardowski. In 1944, he appeared with John Qualen in An American Romance and The Hitler Gang showing the rise of Adolf Hitler. Postwar With the end of the World War II, German actors playing Nazis were less in demand and Ryen's appearances in films dried up by the end of the decade. He had small roles in three movies in 1945, This Love of Ours starring Claude Rains, Salome Where She Danced with Yvonne De Carlo and Paris Underground. Ryen appeared in one movie in 1946, playing a butler in Crack-Up with Pat O'Brien. His last film, another small role, was A Foreign Affair (1948) with Marlene Dietrich. In 10 of the 19 films he made in America, including Casablanca, he was omitted from the credits. He also appeared on stage in America and after 1946 took guest roles at a theater in Basel, Switzerland, before becoming a freelance writer. Ryen died in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965 at the age of 80. Selected filmography * The Bartered Bride (1932) - Finanzrat (uncredited) * Must We Get Divorced?

The official policy was introduced in 1949 by a decree of the Polish United Workers' Party minister (later, Minister of Culture and Art) W≈Çodzimierz Sokorski. As in all Soviet-dominated Eastern Bloc countries, Socialist realism became the main instrument of political control in the building of totalitarianism in Poland. However, the trend has never become truly dominant. Following Stalin's death on March 5, 1953, and the subsequent De-Stalinization of all People's Republics, Polish artists, writers and architects started abandoning it around 1955. The De-Stalinization process peaked during the Polish October. History Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw built using Soviet-drawn blueprints in 1952‚Äì1955 The policy was enforced in Poland between 1949 and 1956 amidst the wave of human rights abuses committed by the state security forces. It involved all domains of cultural politics including visual, music and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture. The objectives of this new trend were explained in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was declared a key weapon in the creation of a new social order. It was intended to help spread the communist ideology by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to designers perceived not as merely architects creating streets and edifices, but rather as \\"engineers of the human soul\\". The idea extended beyond aesthetics and into principles of urban design meant to express grandiose expectations and arouse feelings of stability and political power monopoly in Stalinist Poland. Local characteristics Ministry of Agriculture, Warsaw, built 1953‚Äì1956 Since the style of the Renaissance was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was to become Poland's socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating these principles into new ideology, major changes were also introduced. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of new buildings blending into one another. The all-encompassing Stalinist vision propagated by the Soviet Union was best exemplified by the new Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science (Pa≈Çac Kultury i Nauki imienia J√≥zefa Stalina) constructed in Warsaw between 1952 and 1955. Its design was based on similar skyscrapers built in the USSR at that time. The 3,500 builders were brought in directly from the Soviet Union with their own blueprints, and housed in a suburban shantytown. The monumental form disseminated by the Communist Government reached its apogee with the construction of an entire new town near Krak√≥w along with a steel mill soon to become the biggest in Poland. Nowa Huta was centrally planned as a major new centre of heavy industry, against substantial resistance from middle-class Cracovians. Its Main Square (Plac Centralny) was surrounded by huge blocks of flats populated by a new class of industrial workers employed at the Lenin Steelworks. Notably, the socrealist centre of Nowa Huta is currently considered a monument of architecture. Other prominent examples of urban design included Marsza≈Çkowska Housing Estate (MDM) in Warsaw, Ko≈õciuszkowska Housing Estate (KDM) in Wroc≈Çaw, Main Station Gdynia G≈Ç√≥wna, a housing estate in Kowary, and the Palace of Coal-Basin Culture in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza. Painting and sculpture \\"Manifesto\\" by Wojciech Weiss, 1950 Socialist realism in Polish art was confined to portraits of party leaders and various depictions of muscular labourers and battle scenes, with special attention paid to popular taste. Formally inspired by Neoclassicism as well as the local folk art, socrealism served strictly political and pro-Soviet propaganda purposes; however, its most notable artists, such as Wojciech Weiss and W≈Çodzimierz Zakrzewski were educated before Stalinism and inadvertently adhered to traditional Western techniques and technologies. Some of the most blatantly socrealist paintings were: \\"Pass-on the brick\\" (Podaj ceg≈Çƒô) pictured here, by Aleksander Kobzdej, and \\"Thank you tractor operator\\" (Podziƒôkowanie traktorzy≈õcie) pictured here, as well as \\"Comrade Bierut among labourers\\" (Towarzysz Bierut w≈õr√≥d robotnik√≥w) by Helena and Juliusz Krajewski. allegories surrounding the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw In sculpture, there was a trend toward stone-carved allegories elevating the common worker, used mainly for architectural purposes, such as those surrounding the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, including mostly plaster busts of communist apparatchiks. The collection of Polish socrealist sculpture is exhibited at Koz≈Ç√≥wka Palace near Lubart√≥w. Film and music While the socialist realism doctrine in Soviet cinema originated around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution (Eisenstein, Dovzhenko, Pudovkin) and reached its peak in the 1930s, it did not have sufficient time to develop in postwar Poland. Therefore, the cult of the communist party remained alien to the local film industry. Among the more creative Polish films loosely adhering to principles of socialist realism were Celuloza by Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Pokolenie by Andrzej Wajda and PiƒÖtka z ulicy Barskiej by Aleksander Ford. The ideological stereotype gave birth to some inferior productions as well, such as Uczta Baltazara by Jerzy Zarzycki and Jerzy Passendorfer. In music, the trend was limited to art song, film soundtrack, and pop-song based on local folk tradition. Communist ideals were glorified in lyrics. Among the prominent composers were Jan Maklakiewicz: \\"≈ölƒÖsk pracuje i ≈õpiewa\\" (Silesia Works and Sings), Alfred Gradstein: \\"Na prawo most, na lewo most\\" (A Bridge on the Right, and a Bridge on the Left), and Andrzej Panufnik: \\"Symfonia Pokoju\\" (The Symphony to Peace). Widely promoted popular songs included \\"O Nowej to Hucie piosenka\\" (This Song is about Nowa Huta) featured here with the video. The song is still well remembered by most Polish people of the older generation. Following Stalin's death, and especially from 1953 on, critical opinions were heard with increasing frequency. Finally, as part of the Gomu≈Çka political thaw from within the Polish United Workers' Party, the entire doctrine was officially given up in 1956.Kimball King (2007), Western Drama Through the Ages Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 232.

Cell. 86 (2): 263‚Äì74. . . F-box domains commonly exist in proteins in concert with other protein‚Äìprotein interaction motifs such as leucine-rich repeats (illustrated in the Figure) and WD repeats, which are thought to mediate interactions with SCF substrates. Function F-box proteins have also been associated with cellular functions such as signal transduction and regulation of the cell cycle. In plants, many F-box proteins are represented in gene networks broadly regulated by microRNA- mediated gene silencing via RNA interference. F-box proteins are involved in many plant vegetative and reproduction growth and development. For example, F-box protein-FOA1 involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to affect the seed germination.Peng, Juan; Yu, Dashi; Wang, Liqun; Xie, Minmin; Yuan, Congying; Wang, Yu; Tang, Dongying; Zhao, Xiaoying; Liu, Xuanming (June 2012). \\"Arabidopsis F-box gene FOA1 involved in ABA signaling\\".

In 1968 he was elected President of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). Early life He was born in Halifax on September 12, 1909. His family moved to Sydney, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island when he was still a boy. By age 17, he was working at the coal piers at the Sydney Steel Plant. His education included graduating from Sydney Academy High School and attending St. Francis Xavier University (St. F.X.). Early union experience At the age of 21, Donald MacDonald became the president of the United Mine Workers (UMW) Local 4560. He worked at the pier throughout the 1930s. CCF MLA After the UMW strike of 1940, MacDonald wanted labour to have an active voice in the provincial legislature. He served on the Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation's (CCF) governing board known as the provincial council from 1940 until 1951. In 1941, he then ran for and won the CCF's nomination for the provincial electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton South. He won the 1941 provincial election by a mere 62 votes over Liberal incumbent MLA George Mackay Morrison. Being one of three CCF candidates elected, he became the leader of the CCF party in the Nova Scotia Assembly until 1945. He ran for re-election in 1945, and gained 440 votes over his previous total but due to gerrymandering lost a close election to Liberal John Smith MacIvor. The CCF lost Cape Breton South, but still retained two seats on the island and in the House of Assembly. His successor as party leader, Russell Cunningham was elected in Cape Breton East in the 1945 election, making up for the loss of Cape Breton South. Canadian Congress of Labour In 1942, he joined the organizing staff of the Canadian Congress of Labour (CCL). After his 1945 loss in the Cape Breton South riding, he became the regional director of the Maritime Provinces. In 1951, he became the CCL's secretary-treasurer and chief executive officer. He was very much a part of the organizational force that created the Canada Labour Congress in 1956. President of the CLC He was elected secretary-treasurer at the 1956 founding convention of the CLC. In 1967, during Canada's Centennial Year, MacDonald was appointed acting president of the CLC in September, due to Claude Jodoin being incapacitated by illness. The position formally became his when he was elected president in a 1968 convention. He served three two year terms and resigned in 1974. During this period, he became the first non- European to be elected president of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. He retired in 1974. Donald MacDonald was recognized for his contribution to Canada's business and political life. On December 22, 1972 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. His other honours include: the Canadian Centennial Medal; the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. After a long battle with cancer, MacDonald died in a hospital, in the nation's capital, Ottawa, on September 25, 1986.

Synopsis A king had only his daughter, his wife having died, and had to go to war. The princess promised to stay with her nurse while he was gone. One day, an eagle came by and said she would have a dead man for a husband; it came again the next day. She told her nurse, and her nurse told her to tell the eagle to take her to him. The third day, it came, and she asked; it brought her to a palace, where a prince slept like the dead, and a paper said that whoever had pity on him must watch for three months, three weeks, three days, three hours, and three half-hours without sleeping, and then, when he sneezed, she must bless him and identify herself as the one who watched. He and the whole castle would wake, and he would marry the woman. She watched three months, three weeks, and three days. Then she heard someone offering to hire maids. She hired one for company. The maid persuaded her to sleep, the prince sneezed, and the maid claimed him. She told him to let the princess sleep and when she woke, set to tend the geese. (The fairy tale starts to refer to the prince as the king.) The king had to go to war. He asked the queen what she wanted, and she asked for a golden crown. He asked the goose-girl, and she asked for the millstone of patiences, the hangman's rope, and the butcher's knife, and if he did not bring them, his ship would go neither backward nor forward. He forgot them, and his ship would not move; an old man asked him if he had promised anything, so he bought them. He gave his wife the crown and the other things to the goose-girl. That evening, he went down to her room. She told her story to the things and asked them what she should do. The butcher's knife said to stab herself; the rope, to hang herself; the millstone, to have patience. She asked for the rope again and went to hang herself. The king broke in and saved her. He declared she was his wife and he would hang the other on the rope. She told him only to send her away. They went to her father for his blessing.

A Democrat, he represented the 32nd Senate District, which encompasses Buena Park and the Gateway Cities of Los Angeles County. In January 2018, the State Senate voted to suspend him for 60 days to investigate allegations of sexual harassment. He could not vote on legislation during that period, while contesting the suspension.http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol- alert/article196687314.html Before a vote for expulsion was to be taken by the State Senate due to the released findings of an investigation that determined he likely engaged in a pattern of unwanted advances and sexually suggestive behavior toward six women, including four subordinates, over the last decade, Mendoza resigned on February 22, 2018.http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics- government/capitol-alert/article201577959.html He was a member of the California Latino Legislative Caucus. Prior to being elected to the State Senate in 2014, Mendoza served in the California State Assembly, representing the 56th Assembly District. Before his service in the Legislature, Mendoza was a fourth grade teacher in East Los Angeles, and served as a Mayor and City Councilmember in Artesia. Career After receiving his bachelor's degree in Political Science: Public Administration from California State University, Long Beach and his Multiple Subject Bilingual Teaching Credential from California State University, Los Angeles, Mendoza taught elementary school for ten years in East Los Angeles. During his teaching years with the Los Angeles Unified School District, Mendoza served as a member of the board of directors with United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) and as a representative with the California Teachers Association (CTA) and the National Education Association (NEA). In 1997, Mendoza ran a grassroots campaign in his hometown of Artesia as a candidate for city council. His platform of securing Artesia neighborhoods from gangs resonated with the community, and Mendoza became the youngest, and first Latino member, of the Artesia city council, and the youngest to serve as mayor at the age of 26. Mendoza served three terms on the Artesia city council before running for the State Assembly in 2006. Mendoza represented the communities of Artesia, Buena Park, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier, Lakewood, Los Nietos, and South Whittier. Legislative Accomplishments Mendoza authored several bills that were signed and adopted into law while serving in the Assembly, including bills that dealt with health, public safety and the environment. AB 97 made California the first state in the nation to ban the use of trans fats in food preparation in all California restaurants, cafeterias and bakeries. AB 1291 helped parents take a lead role in the life of their child; the child who has been charged and convicted of a first-time gang related offense can jointly enroll with his or her parent or parents in anti-gang courses to prevent further involvement in gang activities. AB 1488 required smog checks for lightweight diesel vehicles to ensure they are running clean. Mendoza's 2018 legislation was a mix of education, consumer and employment bills. AB 63 protects consumers by requiring retailers who issue a service contract or extended warranty to maintain a copy on file for the life of the contract, and make it available to a consumer within 10 days of request. AB 943 would end the practice of using a person's credit report as a part of the hiring process with the exception of positions that deal with large sums of cash or expensive property. AB 857 would place highly trained individuals from the Employment Development Department (EDD) in local EDD centers to work face-to-face with individuals on their unemployment benefits. This bill also would hire an additional 800 people to serve in call centers. The bill used no state money to fund the program, but instead allocated federal dollars to maintain the level of service to help those transitioning. Community work In 2008, Mendoza launched the Young Legislators, a student program which put high school seniors from throughout the 56th Assembly District in real-life political scenarios. The program's goal is to teach high school seniors about the political world. Seniors who qualify take part in an eight-month program that introduces them to local, regional and statewide office holders who share their perspectives on various issues, and explain their role in the political process. Young Legislators conclude their studies by participating in a mock legislative session in Sacramento in which they deliver and deliberate on legislative bills they have designed and introduced.

It is distinguished from public international law, because in supranational law, nations explicitly submit their right to make judicial decisions by treaty to a set of common tribunal. The United Nations Security Council and subordinate organizations, such as the International Court of Justice, are the only globally accepted supranational tribunals. American supranational law The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was the first supranational agreement where 13 sovereign states were unified in a common government, which later became the United States of America. The central government proved too weak to manage the growing economy as the sovereign states incurred national debts and independently managed their national currencies without central coordination. The supranational government was terminated and the sovereign states were united into a unified sovereign nation-state by the United States Constitution in 1785. European Union supranational law European Union law was the next example of a supranational legal framework. In the EU, sovereign nations have pooled their authority through a system of courts and political institutions. They have the ability to enforce legal norms against and for member states and citizens, in a way that public international law does not. According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the early case, 26/62, of NW Algemene Transporten Expeditie Onderneming van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Adminstratie der Belastingen [1963] ECR 1, (often known as just Van Gend en Loos) it constitutes \\"a new legal order of international law\\": > \\"The Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the > benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit > within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only member > states but also their nationals.

There are four versions of the prayerbook, and two detailed commentaries that themselves contain the entire siddur. The commentaries are known as Or Hadash (\\"A New Light\\"). Original 1985 edition The original Siddur Sim Shalom was edited by Rabbi Jules Harlow, and published in 1985. It succeeded the movement's first Shabbat siddur, Sabbath and Festival Prayer Book (Siddur Tefilot Yisrael), by Rabbi Morris Silverman, edited by a commission chaired by Rabbi Robert Gordis and first published in 1946. Siddur Sim Shalom contained greater discussion of the beliefs and theology of Conservative Judaism. It contains services for weekdays, Shabbat and Jewish festivals. In accord with Conservative theology it contains prayers and services for Israel Independence Day and Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial Day). It is egalitarian in usage, e.g. offering prayers for the wearing of tefillin and tallitot in both feminine and masculine form. While very traditional when compared to the prayerbooks of Reform Judaism, this siddur does contain a number of notable departures from the text used in Orthodox Judaism. Harlow writes that \\"Three of the early morning berakhot were modified to praise God for having created each individual in God's image, a free person and a Jew, rather than the conventional version which express gratitude for not having been created a woman, a slave or a non-Jew.\\" Perhaps the most significant difference between Conservative and Orthodox siddurim is found in the Birkhot HaShachar section; this part of the morning service traditionally contained many passages describing sacrifices that used to be carried out in the Temple in Jerusalem. Many passages on animal sacrifices are not present in Siddur Sim Shalom. Harlow writes \\"The sacrificial ritual in ancient times was construed as means by which a Jew gained atonement for sin. After the destruction of the Temple and the consequential end of sacrifices there, the Jewish people were deprived of this means. To replace the readings on sacrifices, modern Conservative prayerbooks cite the talmudic teaching that deeds of loving-kindness now atone for sin; they draw upon rabbinic tradition to emphasize teachings about atonement and necessary behavior.\\" Additionally, the Amidah for Shabbat & Festivals is supplemented by an alternative, meditative, poetic translative rereading of the Amidah, written by Andr√© Ungar. The pocket edition also includes weekday Torah readings. Shabbat and festivals edition Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals was edited by Rabbi Leonard Cahan, and published in 1998. It started as a new edition of Siddur Sim Shalom just for Shabbat and Festivals (it contains no weekday services; this resulting thinner edition is thus nicknamed \\"Slim Shalom\\"). Most of the translations are nearly identical to Harlow's 1985 edition, but this siddur uses gender-sensitive translations of the names of God, and presents the option to use the Imahot (matriarchs) in the Amidah (Shemoneh Esrei). It also restores a few traditional Ashkenazic prayers that were not in the 1985 version, including Rabbi Ishmael's 13 principles of biblical interpretation, the B'rah Dodi poems for Pesach, Ana B'kho-ah at the end of Psalm 29 in Kabbalat Shabbat, and Ushpizin for Sukkot, included in a new, egalitarian version. The Y'hi Ratzon meditation following the Musaf Amidah is restored. It includes new translations of a number of prayers and poems that were not translated at all in the previous edition, including Akdamut and the Hoshanot (only summaries of these prayers had been given previously.) It offers an easier to follow layout and table of contents; many pages have notes explaining the background and meanings of the prayers; guidelines and instructions on the content, choreography and continuity of the service. There is an increased use of transliteration. It contains a comprehensive section of Shabbat and Holiday home rituals. Weekdays edition  Siddur Sim Shalom for Weekdays was edited by Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, and published in 2003. This siddur is the companion to Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals. In the introduction the editor writes: :We began with the text of the original Siddur Sim Shalom published in 1985 under the...skillful editorship of Rabbi Jules Harlow whose eloquent and poetic translations inspire this text....Many of the innovations and approaches of the 'Siddur for Shabbat and Festivals' have been adopted here. Whenever possible, pages were reproduced intact, or with minor changes. This weekday siddur contains Torah reading, inspirational messages, services for the home and includes new materials for special occasions and commemorations. :We felt keenly that while the miraculous events of the founding of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel. Friday night edition Siddur Sim Shalom for Friday Night: With Commentary and Complete Transliteration. Edited by Laurence A. Sebert. Offers a complete transliteration of the Friday night service, including Minhah, Kabbalat Shabbat, and Maariv. It uses the Hebrew text and translation from Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals and commentary from Or Hadash. Or Hadash Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals was written by Israel Masorti Rabbi Reuven Hammer, and published in 2003. It contains the complete text of the siddur for the Sabbath and festivals, surrounded by a comprehensive commentary. The page layout loosely resembles that of the Talmud. Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Weekdays was also written by Israel Masorti Rabbi Reuven Hammer, and published in 2008. It contains the complete text of the siddur for weekdays, surrounded by a comprehensive commentary. Both volumes offer information on the historical development of the liturgy, \\"a phrase-by-phrase commentary, a linguistic, literary and theological explanation of their structure and meaning as well as interpretations meant to make them relevant for the modern worshipper.\\"From the description on the Rabbinical Assembly website. See, e.g., See also Successor series  In 2010 the Rabbinical Assembly released the first in a series of successor volumes. Lev Shalem (\\"A full heart\\") 2010 saw the release of Mahzor Lev Shalem, for Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, while 2016 brought the release of Siddur Lev Shalem, for Shabbat and Festivals. In 2018, the latest addition was Pirkei Avot: The Wisdom of Our Sages. These prayerbooks contain entirely new translations and commentaries, and slightly different choices of prayers. They often give more literal translations of the prayers. English transliterations are offered for all prayers and lines recited aloud by the congregation. The page layout surrounds prayers with a variety of English commentaries and readings, as one finds in classical rabbinic commentaries.

The nucleus of the band was formed early, when Don and Jerry Parkins met Terry Walker while Terry and Don were in the second grade. Nick Nicholis joined the group of friends a few years later during junior high school. Eventually they formed a band that became the Bizarros in their 20s. After trying out a couple of one shot drummers, Rick Garberson joined as the last member of the original lineup. Nicholis embraced the DIY concept of marketing music decades before it was trendy. He started his own label, Clone Records, to release the band's music not long after the band was formed. The label become an early home for several other Akron acts. The label's first LP release was 1977's From Akron, a split album with The Rubber City Rebels which Nicholis sent to Village Voice Critic Robert Christgau. Christgau, who reviewed the album favorably, shortly afterwards visited to the region and was instrumental, although not alone, in the Akron/Kent music scene becoming noticed on an international level. An Early Bizarros Publicity Image in front of the Akron/Goodyear Airdock The band were signed to the Mercury subsidiary Blank Records. New Musical Express wrote at this point that the band was starting to tone down its \\"hard and vicious\\" style, and was developing a \\"brooding edge that compares well with the Stranglers\\". In 1979, the band released its self-titled debut album on Mercury. A restructuring of the Mercury label, which included Blank being dissolved, left the band without a label. The self titled album was well received though, and was given an even stronger review by Christgau than their first album. The band released additional singles on Clone Records. But the Mercury disappointment, along with the untimely death of drummer Garberson, resulted in Nicholis deciding to step away from the music world and concentrate on a more stable career; by this time Nicholis was married with children. The Parkins Brothers and Walker continued on for a short time, adding a few friends to their lineup, but in under a year the band ended its original run. Walker, Nicholis and the Parkins Brothers all remained friends, frequently socializing with each other, but as the Bizarros they only briefly reunited in 1996, followed by another, public reunion in 2002. In 2003, the band revived the name Clone Records to release the Bizarros' first new studio album in 24 years, Can't Fight Your Way Up Town From Here. They added drummer Martyn Flunoy, who had been playing with Jerry Parkins. Flunoy is still with the band and is Bizarros longest tenured drummer, spending longer with the band than all the other drummers combined. From the cover of the Bizarros 2019 release, From Akron II They stayed out of the studio, although playing live shows frequently, until 2018. In a homage to their first album they released From Akron II along with the another Akron band, The Bad Dudes. The band again revived the name Clone Records for the release. A member of the Bad Dudes, Kal Mullens, was also one of the friends who stepped in during Nicholis' departure. Terry Walker, the Bizarros' second guitarist, keyboard player, and co-songwriter, died of cancer on June 26, 2018. The band has continued to perform as a quartet, although Walker continues to be featured in their marketing.

In June of the next year, The Oklahoma Department of Vocational and Technical Education completed a feasibility study to determine if a local district could form an area district around the former base. January 27, 1970, was the beginning of Western Technology Center when several school districts unanimously voted to become a part of the area district and the election of board members was held for Zones 1 through 5. In 1987, the new 350-seat seminar center and cafeteria were completed at the Burns Flat campus. In May 1991, WTC purchased property in Weatherford along I-40. Renovations to an existing building were soon completed and classes began in 1992. August 1995 construction was completed at the Sayre campus and both full-time and part- time classes began. In 2003, WTC opened a fourth campus in Hobart, The Kiowa County Adult Education Center. This campus offers an adult education and training facility, which also hosts group meetings in the Kiowa County area and offers patrons conference facilities. The next year WTC began renovating the east wing of the Weatherford campus to house a partnership program with the University of Oklahoma's School of Dental Hygiene, which opened in 2005.

The 48-line poem was first released in the April 1839 issue of Nathan Brooks' American Museum magazine. It was eventually incorporated into \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" as a song written by Roderick Usher. Analysis The poem serves as an allegory about a king \\"in the olden time long ago\\" who is afraid of evil forces that threaten him and his palace, foreshadowing impending doom. As part of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", Poe said, \\"I mean to imply a mind haunted by phantoms ‚Äî a disordered brain\\" Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. Cooper Square Press, 2001. p. 111. referring to Roderick Usher. The poem takes a marked change in tone towards the second to last stanza. After discussing the wit and wisdom of the king, and song and beauty in the kingdom: :But evil things, in robes of sorrow, :Assailed the monarch's high estate. The house and family are destroyed and, apparently, become phantoms. The beginning of the poem compares the structure with a human head. For example, the windows are eyes, its door representing a mouth. The exterior represents physical features while the interior represents the mind engaged in imaginative thought.Wilbur, Richard. \\"The House of Poe,\\" collected in Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967: 104‚Äì105. Publication history In 1845, Thomas Dunn English claimed Poe had tried to sell \\"The Haunted Palace\\" to John L. O'Sullivan of the Democratic Review but was rejected because he \\"found it impossible to comprehend it\\".Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 587. It is unclear if this is true. The poem was published in the April 1839 issue of the Baltimore Museum.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. Checkmark Books, 2001: 104. Critical reception Rufus Wilmot Griswold, a known rival of Poe's, claimed that Poe had plagiarized the poem from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \\"Beleaguered City\\". Poe denied that charge and suggested that Longfellow had, in fact, plagiarized from him.Moss, Sidney P. Poe's Literary Battles: The Critic in the Context of his Literary Milieu. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969: 126. Nevertheless, \\"The Haunted Palace\\" was one of the poems highlighted in Griswold's The Poets and Poetry of America, one of the first anthologies of American poetry in 1842. When the poem was reprinted by the New World in 1845, Charles Eames introduced it as exquisite. \\"We can hardly call to mind in the whole compass of American Poetry, a picture of more intense and glowing Ideality.\\"Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1987: 498. . Adaptations In 1904, French composer Florent Schmitt wrote an etude, Le palais hant√©, derived from \\"The Haunted Palace\\".AmericanSymphony.org In 1963, the poem provided the title for a Roger Corman film of the same name. The actual plot of Corman's film The Haunted Palace comes almost entirely from The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, a novel by H. P. Lovecraft. By 1963, Corman had produced several highly lucrative films based on Poe's work, but Lovecraft was not at that time a well-known author; according to Corman on the DVD making-of featurette, the studio forced him to name this movie after one of Poe's poems (and included a Poe epigraph in the credits) so that audiences would believe it to be another film based on Poe's writings. In 1987, Bulgarian rock band Shturcite released a song, \\"Omagiosaniyat zamuk\\". The song's lyrics are a translation of The Haunted Palace into Bulgarian but, in 1990, when the track was released on the compilation The Crickets, the track title was back-translated into English as \\"The Haunted Castle\\". In 2009, Lithuanian contemporary classical music composer Giedrius Alkauskas wrote an Art song for a bass singer and a piano, based on the translation of \\"The Haunted Palace\\" into Lithuanian made by Aleksys Churginas.http://www.bernardinai.lt/straipsnis/2011-04-26-giedrius-alkauskas- i-sapnu-ir-burtu-lauka/61863 (in Lithuanian, Bernardinai.lt).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GawyXCCIfm4.

It is a trait that only occurs in mammalian taxa, such as most strepsirrhine primates and the hyrax, while haplorhine primates have evolved fully enclosed sockets. One theory for this evolutionary difference is the relative importance of vision to both orders. As haplorrhines (tarsiers and simians) tend to be diurnal, and rely heavily on visual input, many strepsirrhines are nocturnal and have a decreased reliance on visual input. Postorbital bars evolved several times independently during mammalian evolution and the evolutionary histories of several other clades. Some species, such as Tarsiers, have a postorbital septum. This septum can be considered as joined processes with a small articulation between the frontal bone, the zygomatic bone and the alisphenoid bone and is therefore different from the postorbital bar, while it forms a composite structure together with the postorbital bar. Other species such as dermopterans have postorbital processes, which is a more primitive incomplete stage of the postorbital bar.  Function of the Postorbital Bar  In the past decades, many different hypothesis were made on the possible function of the postorbital bar. Three of them are commonly cited. = External trauma hypothesis = Prince and Simons offered the external trauma hypothesis, where the postorbital bar protects the orbital contents from external trauma. However, a few years later Cartmill showed otherwise. He was convinced that the postorbital bar was not adequate enough to offer protection against sharp objects such as the teeth of other species. He was therefore convinced that the postorbital bar must have a different function. = Mastication hypothesis = Greaves offered a new view on this bone and came up with the mastication hypothesis. Greaves suggests that the bar strengthens the relatively weak orbital area against torsional loading, imposed by bite force in species with large masseter and temporalis muscles. However the orientation of the postorbital process does not match the direction of the forces mentioned by Greaves. = Position hypothesis = Cartmill suggests that in small mammals with large eyes and relatively small temporal fossae, where the anterior temporal muscle and the temporalis fascia are pulled to a more lateral position with increasing orbital convergence (front-facing eyes), the tension caused by the contraction of these muscles would distort the orbital margins and disrupt oculomotor precision. Heesy shows that the postorbital bar stiffens the lateral orbit. Without a stiffened lateral orbit, deformation would displace soft tissues, when contraction of the anterior temporalis muscle takes place, thus impeding eye movement.  Occurrence  A complete postorbital bar has evolved at least eleven times as a convergent adaptation in nine mammalian orders. Postorbital bars are characteristic to the following clades: * Order Primates * Order Scandentia * Order Perissodactyla ** Subfamily Equinae * Order Artiodactyla ** Suborder Neoselenodontia Postorbital bars have furthermore developed individually in the following taxa: * Clade Metatheria ** Order ‚Ä†Sparassodonta *** ‚Ä†Thylacosmilus ** Order Diprotodontia *** ‚Ä†Thylacoleo * Clade Eutheria ** Order Carnivora *** Barbourofelis ** Order ‚Ä†Litopterna *** ‚Ä†Thoatherium *** ‚Ä†Diadiaphorus ** Order Sirenia *** Trichechus senegalensis ** Order Artiodactyla *** Balaenoptera acutorostrata The presence of a postorbital bar in the extinct Oviraptorosauria species Avimimus portentosus was one of several defining characteristics that suggested to paleontologists that the species was more morphologically different from avian species than previously thought, affecting interpretation of the rate of evolution from dinosaurs to birds.  Postorbital process  Postorbital bars are likely derived from well-developed postorbital processes, an intermediate condition where a small gap retains between the process and the zygomatic arch. Well-developed postorbital processes have evolved separately within the orders of the Dermoptera and Hyracoidae and the Chiropteran families of Emballonuridae and Pteropodidae and to varying degrees within many carnivorian taxa. Complete postorbital bars and well-developed postorbital processes, retaining gaps of mere centimetres, spanned by the postorbital ligament, occur as polymorphisms within a number of pteropodid and hyracoid taxa.

The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-delta-cadinene-forming). This enzyme participates in terpenoid biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, magnesium. Delta-cadinene synthase, a sesquiterpene cyclase, is an enzyme expressed in plants that catalyzes a cyclization reaction in terpenoid biosynthesis. The enzyme cyclizes farnesyl diphosphate to delta-cadinene and releases pyrophosphate. Delta-cadinene synthase is one of the key steps in the synthesis of gossypol, a toxic terpenoid produced in cotton seeds. Recently, cotton plants that stably underexpress the enzyme in seeds have been developed using RNA interference techniques, producing a plant that had been proposed as a rich source of dietary protein for developing countries.

He was a graduate of the School of Medicine and Surgery, Lisbon, 1896, and interned at the Maternity and Hospital for Women at Lisbon. Following his hospital work there, he served on the staffs of civil and military hospitals in the Portuguese possessions of Portuguese Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea, Africa. Later he went to the United States with his wife and children and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In 1902 Dr. de Faria arrived in Honolulu and was licensed to practice in September of that year. His office and residence was located on Alakea Street; and he specialized in obstetrics and diseases of women. Controversy Within a few days of being licensed, Dr. de Faria was implicated by a fellow physician in a romantic tangle, which surely must have been the talk of Honolulu. Dr. Luiz Alvarez, Spanish born physician, brought a clipping from the Independente, a Portuguese newspaper published in New Bedford, to the office of the Advertiser to call attention to an article about a Dr. Faria who, leaving his wife and children, had run away with Mrs. Sanders, who also took her husband's savings when she left. Dr. Alvarez claimed that Dr. de Faria practicing medicine in Honolulu and the Dr. Faria of the newspaper article were one and the same, and the story appeared, together with Dr. Alvarez's accusations, on September 26, 1902. On the following day a letter from Dr. de Faria was published in the Advertiser in which he denied that he was running away or trying to hide his identity and accused Dr. Alvarez of professional jealousy because he had refused to enter into a partnership with Alvarez. However, he did not deny running away with another man's wife, merely stating that he would take up that matter when the sheriff came to get him. A few days later the Advertiser carried Dr. Alvarez's rebuttal to Dr. de Faria's letter in which he countered that he could hardly have thought of offering a partnership to a man he did not know. He also contended that Dr. de Faria did not use his own name on arriving in Honolulu and brought no character references with him, in spite of knowing that he would have to produce such references in order to be granted a license to practice medicine. He further accused Dr. de Faria of giving Alvarez's name to the Board of Health as a character reference without his knowledge or consent. With this the verbal sparring between the medicos comes to an end - at least in the pages of the Advertiser. However, there is an amazing sequel to this affair of the heart, which is recounted in the Advertiser for March 26, 1903, under a New Bedford dateline. The story describes how Mrs. de Faria sent her four children to Portugal and then set out with only $100 to search for her husband. Eventually, she found herself in San Francisco where the trail ended. While working at odd jobs in the hopes that some clue would turn up, Mrs. de Faria happened to pick up a Honolulu newspaper, and, in turning through the pages, came across Dr. de Faria's business card. Her meager savings were just enough to pay her passage to Honolulu. On arrival, her sudden appearance and the tale of her untiring search so moved her husband that the two were reunited. According to the story, the reunion was further helped by the fact that the romance between the doctor and Mrs. Sanders was cooling due to the lady's interest in a young Army officer. In any event, the tale ends with the doctor and his wife departing secretly for Portugal \\"never to return\\" and leaving Mrs. Sanders deserted and without funds in Honolulu. Return Whether or not Dr. de Faria went to Portugal in 1903 is not known, but he is listed as president of the articles of association of the Liberdade Publishing Company, Ltd. filed in October, 1903, in Honolulu.Pacific Commercial Advertiser. \\"Portuguese Publishing Company.\\" October 9, 1903, p. 6. Retrieved on October 5, 2015. Certainly, he had returned to Honolulu and was in practice by 1904 when he became a member of the Hawaiian Territorial Medical Society. During his years in Honolulu he was the originator and chief promoter of A P√°tria, a Portuguese society whose objects were financial benefit, social intercourse, and the education of its members. Leaving the Islands in August, 1905, the doctor set out on the first leg of a trip which was to take him to Portugal, France and Germany to study and visit medical institutions. On his return he located in Oakland, California, where he practiced for a number of years. The 1923 Medical Directory lists him as still living in Oakland, but after that he is not listed and nothing further is known about him.

Stalking on extremely steep deer forests such as his own at Glencassley, Lloyd was in search of a \\"canyon rifle\\" cartridge that would shoot exceptionally fast and with a very flat trajectory across deep valleys and over distances out to and more, to make range estimation less critical for accurate bullet placement, and to deliver a hard-hitting bullet weighing a minimum of 100 grains. The .244 H&H; Magnum easily met these criteria. History Based upon the well-proven .375 H&H; Magnum rimless belted big game cartridge case heavily necked down, the .244 H&H; originally fired a , aluminum-jacketed, copper-pointed bullet pushed by of non-cordite smokeless (nitrocellulose) powder, and returned a muzzle velocity of about . That load and velocity remain standard for the commercially loaded cartridge today; although handloaders can achieve higher velocities with careful load tuning. The .244 seldom performs well in barrels less than long, owing to the need for a longer bore to allow pressure and bullet velocity to reach intended levels. Lloyd was unable and unwilling to embark upon commercial cartridge production, and consequently \\"gave\\" the cartridge to veteran London rifle and ammunition makers Holland & Holland Ltd., who in 1954 had paid him ¬£250 towards his cartridge development costs. H&H; quickly adopted it, the cartridge acquired the prestigious \\"H&H;\\" appellation, and both H&H; and David Lloyd went on to build significant numbers of very high quality bolt-action deer-stalking rifles in .244 H&H; Magnum calibre (see Lloyd rifle). Initially, commercially loaded ammunition was manufactured by IMI Kynoch at its Birmingham, England factory. Commercially, this cartridge has only ever been loaded with bullets: lighter- and heavier-bulleted loads have been created by handloaders. Chuck Hawks, a prominent US commentator on rifle cartridges, opines that, \\"the .244 H&H; Magnum represents some sort of high water mark in the development of the 6 mm cartridge. To use an aviation analogy, you could think of it as the Concorde of rifle cartridges.\\".244 H&H; Magnum by Chuck Hawks David Lloyd, the .244's originator, went on to develop a still more powerful prototype round by reducing the case body taper and increasing the already large power capacity to produce the \\"David Lloyd 6 mm Magnum\\". His hope was to use bullets heavier than the .244 H&H; standard ; but this cartridge was never commercially produced, and only two prototype Lloyd rifles are believed to have been chambered for it. In the early 1990s British fieldsports author and ballistician Colin McKelvie had a custom rifle built on a BRNO CZ Magnum action, with a .244in Border Barrel with a 1:7 fast twist. Using handloads with very-low-drag (VLD) .244in hollow-point bullets of , accuracy of 0.63 MOA was achieved, with average muzzle velocity of 3,630 ft/s (1,106 m/s) and acceptable chamber pressures. This level of performance is what Lloyd had sought with his \\"improved\\" .244 H&H; Magnum. Controversy While the belted .244 H&H; Magnum could be considered the velocity/energy pinnacle of 6 mm/.240in cartridges, that power comes at the cost of significant muzzle blast, as well as shorter-than-average barrel life; in addition to which commercially loaded ammunition is expensive. Because of these drawbacks the cartridge never came into widespread popularity, and has never been offered as a chambering by any of the mass-market riflemakers. The .244 H&H; rather fell by the wayside in favour of 6 mm rifles in the same general class such as the .240 Weatherby Magnum (for which it had been an inspiration to designer Roy Weatherby), and also the various 6.5 mm Magnums. The .244 H&H; still has its adherents, however, and occasional rifles are still chambered in this caliber by Holland & Holland and others. Ammunition is still made for Holland & Holland and used cases can be handloaded.

It was originally operated as a joint venture between Comcast, Lions Gate Entertainment, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. The on-demand service featured full-length horror, thriller, and suspense films as well as shorts, trailers, interviews, and behind-the-scenes featurettes. It was available to subscribers of Comcast, Cox Communications, Verizon FiOS, AT&T; U-verse, Insight Communications, Bresnan Communications, Guadalupe Valley Systems, Buckeye CableSystem, Time Warner Cable, Wave Broadband, Bright House Networks, and CenturyLink. =Fearnet cable channel= Fearnet launched as a linear cable channel on October 31, 2010. The network was originally scheduled to launch four weeks earlier on October 1, but the date was pushed back as Fearnet was in the midst of carriage negotiations with cable providers to carry the linear channel. The Fearnet channel was available through Comcast (in select markets), Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS, Bright House Networks, and CenturyLink. The network aired over 350 full-length feature films annually, as well as popular series (such as Tales from the Crypt and Reaper) and original content (such as Holliston) and the weekend program block called \\"Funhouse\\". In September 2012, Fearnet became the first television network to offer Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI), technology which decreases integration time from four weeks to as few as three days, and allows advertisers to refresh creative mid-campaign and track impressions on a daily basis. =Fearnet.com= The Fearnet website featured thriller, suspense, and horror films available for streaming (with available content updated each week); other videos including movie trailers and shorts; daily news and reviews that covered all aspects of the genre; and sweepstakes, chats, and forums. The website had over 270,000 registered users. =Leadership and ownership changes= In 2010, Peter Block (who launched the top-grossing Saw horror film franchise, and produced several other blockbuster horror and thriller films including Hostel, Cabin Fever, Open Water, and House at the End of the Street) was named president and general manager of Fearnet, replacing Diane Robina. In addition to his duties at Fearnet, Block continued to run his production company A Bigger Boat. =Merger with Chiller= On April 14, 2014, Comcast purchased Lions Gate Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment's stakes in Fearnet to acquire full ownership of the channel. Comcast planned to fold Fearnet's programming into its existing horror- and thriller-focused network Chiller (owned by the company's NBCUniversal Cable unit) and move some of Fearnet's programming to Syfy. The merger occurred on July 30, 2014 at midnight, after an airing of House of 1000 Corpses. Chiller ceased operations on December 31, 2017 folding the former Fearnet channel space. Programming =Original programming= On April 3, 2012, Fearnet premiered its first original series, Holliston, a horror/comedy series starring real-life filmmakers Adam Green and Joe Lynch as two college graduates chasing the dream of becoming successful horror filmmakers while struggling to make ends meet through their jobs at a Boston public-access cable channel. The series was renewed for a second season which aired in 2013. =Funhouse= In August 2012, Fearnet debuted a two-hour program block on Saturday and Sunday mornings called \\"Funhouse\\", featuring reruns of science-fiction and horror series aimed at children, including: The Real Ghostbusters, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, Eerie, Indiana, and Dark Oracle.

Portantino (born January 29, 1961) is an American politician currently serving in the California State Senate. A Democrat, he represents the 25th Senate District which encompasses portions of the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. Prior to his election to the State Senate, Portantino served in the California State Assembly from 2006 to 2012, representing the 44th Assembly District. He won election to the State Senate in 2016 after defeating Republican Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich.  Political career  Portantino served two terms on the La Ca√±ada Flintridge City Council, from 1999 until 2006. There, he was mentored by Carol Liu, who endorsed him to succeed her in the California State Assembly. Portantino's professional experience includes working in the art department and as Property Master with the American Playhouse, was Production Designer on Grizzly Adams: The Mark of the Bear and Art Director on Unsolved Mysteries. At the request of the Screen Actors Guild in 2010, Portantino proposed an anti-gatecrashing law that would make party crashing a misdemeanor with punishments being up to six months in jail, or a $1,000 fine, or both. He said that party crashing posed a threat to public safety. He introduced legislation to remove tattoos from victims of forced prostitution. After his term finished in the California State Assembly, Portantino initially stated that he would run for Congress against David Dreier, even though the district had yet to be drawn. He later contemplated a run against Senator Carol Liu in State Senate District 25 but opted against it, citing personal reasons. In 2013, Portantino began actively campaigning to fill the seat of Senator Liu, who will be forced out of the District 25 position by term limits in 2016. In May 2019, Portantino, as Senate Appropriations Committee Chair, used a pocket veto to temporarily block SB 50, a bill that would enact reforms to address the California housing shortage by reducing local control (such as allowing more apartment construction near public transit and in suburbs), from leaving committee to enter the Senate for debate and voting. Proponents of the bill accused Portantino of abusing his powers to deny Senate Bill 50 a debate and a vote in the Senate. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Portantino's opposition to the bill was expected, but that it was a surprise that he would not allow the bill to advance out of committee. Due to Portantino's action, the bill was not considered by the Senate until 2020.

Although, French Emperor Napoleon enacted five major codes, which were, in Japanese, altogether metonymically referred to as \\"the Napoleonic Code\\" (the official name of the Civil Code, the first and most prominent one), the Japanese added to this their own constitution to form six codes in all, and thus it came to be called the ropp≈ç or \\"six codes.\\" Legislation in Japan tends to be terse. The statutory volume Ropp≈ç Zensho (literally: Book of Six Codes), similar in size to a large dictionary, contains all six codes as well as many other statutes enacted by the Diet. The Six Codes were introduced to China in 1905 after the reform and modernization of the Chinese legal system led by Cixi. Such reform was based on the similar laws adopted in Germany, France, and Japan. After the establishment of Nationalist Government, the Complete Book of Six Codes was passed on October 3 1928. The Chinese Communist Party abolished the practices of Six Codes on the land of Communist control in February 1949. As a result of Japanese colonial rule and the Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, the legal system in Taiwan is strongly influenced by Japan and China.Tay-sheng Wang, Legal Reform in Taiwan under Japanese Colonial Rule, 1895-1945: The Reception of Western Law (2014).Chang-Fa Lo, The Legal Culture and System of Taiwan (2006)..ÁéãÊ≥∞Âçá, Ê¶ÇËø∞Âè∞ÁÅ£Ê≥ïÁöÑÊ≠∑Âè≤,ÊÄùÊÉ≥ËàáÊ≥ïÂ≠∏ [An Overview of Taiwan‚Äôs Legal History, Thought, and Study], 290 Âè∞ÁÅ£Ê≥ïÂ≠∏ÈõúË™å 13 (2016).

She appeared in the premiere of Picker's An American Tragedy (2005) at the Met, and portrayed Love Simpson in the premiere of Carlisle Floyd's Cold Sassy Tree (2000) at the Houston Grand Opera. Early life and education Racette was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1965, the middle child of three siblings. Her father was a union representative and distributor of Pepsi products in southern New Hampshire. Her mother, now deceased, was a part-time bank employee and homemaker. At the age of seven she relocated with her family to Bedford, New Hampshire, where she spent the rest of her youth. Both her parents were originally from Bedford. She began playing guitar at age 8. Self- taught, she began singing along with the guitar, which became the source of her interest in vocal music. She attended Manchester High School West, where she was very active in the school music program. Under the direction of Richard Maynard, she participated in regional chorale competitive festivals.Manchester High School West website Upon graduation from high school in 1983, Racette matriculated at the University of North Texas with the intent of studying vocal jazz. She was told her voice was more amenable to opera performance than jazz, which initially upset her. However, she eventually found that she really enjoyed opera and enthusiastically pursued a vocal studies major, studying with Pattye Johnstone. In her senior year she won first prize in the auditions for the Merola Opera Program, the training arm of the San Francisco Opera.Philip Gambone, Travels in a Gay Nation: Portraits of LGBTQ Americans (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2010), 61 Her first opera performance was at a community college in Fort Worth, Texas, in the title role in Carlisle Floyd's Susannah.Charlene Baldridge, \\"The reluctant diva: Lesbian opera singer Patricia Racette talks about life and love, onstage and off\\", Gay and Lesbian Times, Issue #851, 15 April 2004 After graduating from college, Racette made her professional opera debut in 1988 in Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly with the San Francisco Western Opera Theater and traveled with the company for performances in New York City. Critic Bernard Holland said of her performance, \\"Patricia Racette was an especially compelling actress as Cio-Cio San, and it was acting achieved through music ‚Äì just as opera performance should be. Yet Miss Racette has a soprano voice that, while musically and technically reliable, is never terribly luxurious in sound.\\" She made her debut with the San Francisco Opera in 1989 as the voice of the priestess in Aida. She sang several more roles with the company while in the Merola program, including Alice Ford in Falstaff, Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus, Sister Osmina in Suor Angelica, and Freia and Helmwige in The Ring Cycle. In 1991 she was made an Adler Fellow at the San Francisco Opera, which led to several more performances at the SFO over the next two years, including Mica√´la in Carmen, Dunyasha in War and Peace, the First Lady in The Magic Flute, and Mim√¨ in La boh√®me.San Francisco Opera Archives Career In 1992 Racette joined the roster of singers at the New York City Opera, making her debut with the company as Musetta in La boh√®me. She sang one more role with the company in the spring of 1993, Mica√´la in Carmen. In March of 1993 she made her Vancouver Opera debut as Blanche de la Force in Poulenc's Carmelites, and later that year she made her debut with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni. She also continued her relationship with the San Francisco Opera, portraying Margherita in Mefistofele in 1994, and made her first European appearances that year at the Vienna State Opera and the Welsh National Opera. Although she received good reviews for these performances, it was not until she won the Marian Anderson Award in 1994, an award which also helped further the careers of Sylvia McNair (1990), Denyce Graves (1991), and Nathan Gunn (1996), that she drew wider attention in the opera world. In 1994 Racette was offered a contract by the Metropolitan Opera to perform the role of Musetta in La boh√®me for performance in the spring of 1995. She made her debut at the house on March 4, 1995, with Mary Mills as Mim√¨, Luis Lima as Rodolfo, as Marcello, and John Fiore conducting. Her performance was so well received she was immediately engaged to sing the role of Mim√¨ in subsequent seasons, and has remained an annual performer at the Met since her debut. Her popularity at the house grew rapidly, and she began to add more roles to her Met repertoire in the late 1990s, including Ellen Orford in Peter Grimes, Antonia/Stella in Les contes d'Hoffmann, and Violetta in La traviata. She took over the latter part in 1998 after the firing of Angela Gheorghiu and the cancellation of Ren√©e Fleming. In the 2000s she has added the roles Alice Ford in Falstaff, Blanche de la Force in Dialogues of the Carmelites, Elizabeth of Valois in Don Carlos, and Nedda in Pagliacci to her Met repertoire. In 2005 she notably portrayed Roberta Alden in the world premiere of Tobias Picker's An American Tragedy. She most recently sang the role of Cio-Cio San at the house in 2012.Metropolitan Opera Archives In 1996 Racette had a major critical success portraying the title role in the world premiere of Tobias Picker's Emmeline for her debut at the Santa Fe Opera. She has since returned to that house frequently, portraying Violetta (1997), Blanche de la Force (1999), Tatyana in Eugene Onegin (2002), the title role in K√°≈•a Kabanov√° (2003), Amelia Grimaldi in Simon Boccanegra (2004), and Li√π in Turandot (2005). She most recently returned to the house to portray the role of Leslie Crosby in the premiere of Paul Moravec's The Letter in 2009.Santa Fe Opera Archives website In 1998 Racette was the recipient of the coveted Richard Tucker Award, which is given annually by the Richard Tucker Music Foundation to an American-born opera singer on the threshold of a major national and international career. Some prior recipients of this award have been Ren√©e Fleming (1990), Deborah Voigt (1992), Ruth Ann Swenson (1993), Dwayne Croft (1996), and David Daniels (1997). Racette continued to maintain an active relationship with the San Francisco Opera during the late 1990s up to the present day. Among the many appearances she has made with the company are Mathilde in William Tell (1997), the title role in Luisa Miller (2000), the title role in Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa (2001), Violetta (2001), Desdemona in Otello (2002), Li√π (2002), and several performance of Cio-Cio San from 2005 through 2008 among other roles. In 2000 Racette made her debut at La Scala as Ellen Orford and her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Jen≈Øfa. She has since returned to Chicago numerous time to portray such roles as Mim√¨, Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust, Mica√´la, Li√π, and Madame Lidoine.Lyric Opera of Chicago Archives In 2005 she made her first appearance at the Los Angeles Opera as Cio-Cio San.

She was also on the cover of the February 2006 edition of the Lesbian News and was featured in the September 2002 edition of The Advocate. She has been known to silence critics with her pointed responses. Although a perfectionist known for exacting standards, she dislikes analysis of opera in strictly technical terms, insisting on asking \\"But how does it make you feel?\\"AllAboutOpera.com She and her wife, fellow opera singer Beth Clayton, whom she met in 1997, travel about 10 months of the year. For the other two months, they live in a home which they built in the middle of the desert on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.Philip Gambone, Travels in a Gay Nation: Portraits of LGBTQ Americans (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2010), pp. 64‚Äì66 In June 2002, she was featured as the cover story for the Opera News magazine and requested that the magazine include her public coming-out statement. She stated that her sexuality and her long-term relationship with Clayton were a very important part of who she is as an artist.Opera News profile of Racette & Clayton stated, \\"We did what we considered a very important cover story in June 2002, in which Patricia Racette, a very important soprano, publicly discussed her homosexuality for the first time. The response from our readers on that was overwhelmingly positive. The difference for us is that Miss Racette was on our cover because of her accomplishments as a singer. Her relationship with her partner was and is a very important part of who she is an artist, so with her permission and encouragement, we included a discussion of that part of her life. We did not put her on the cover of the magazine because she was a lesbian.\\" Racette and Clayton were married in the summer of 2005.Questia.com The subject of Racette's homosexuality has been covered in numerous other magazine interviews and articles since.Susan McIntosh, \\"Patricia Racette: Interview With The Acclaimed Soprano\\", Hillgirlz at Hillgirlz.com The Advocate, Sept. 17, 2002Dave White, \\"Dynamic Duo: Patricia Racette and Beth Clayton celebrate their wedding and sing out for pride at Lincoln Center\\", The Advocate, June 21, 2005 Will O'Brien, \\"The Diva Next Door: Patricia Racette is out, proud and operatic\\", Metro Weekly, 26 April 2007 accessed 27 July 2009Scott Barnes, \\"Nouveau Niche\\", Opera News, October 2009, pp. 18‚Äì22.

He was previously a member of the California State Assembly, representing California's 43rd Assembly District. He is a member of the Democratic Party and is the first Armenian American to be elected to office in the City of Los Angeles. Personal life Krekorian was born in San Fernando Valley, California, and is a third-generation San Fernando Valley resident. He is the son of JoAnn, a North Hollywood native, and Erwin Krekorian, a Marine Corps WWII veteran. His father was of Armenian descent and ran a small business on Saticoy Street in Van Nuys. Krekorian completed his primary education entirely within the Los Angeles Unified School District, graduating from Cleveland High School (Los Angeles, California) in Reseda. As the first member of his family to attend college, Krekorian enrolled in the University of Southern California, where he first became active in political causes. He worked with then-Assemblyman Tom Bane, became the campus organizer for Jerry Brown's 1978 gubernatorial campaign and helped lead USC's Democratic student group. After graduating with a B.A. degree in Political Science from USC, Krekorian went on to earn a J.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. Krekorian became an organizer for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and co-chaired the Saxophone Club, the Democratic National Committee's nationwide young professionals group. Krekorian practiced law, with a focus on business, entertainment and intellectual property litigation, at the firms Skadden Arps, Dewey Ballantine and Leopold, Petrich & Smith and Fisher & Krekorian, where he was a name partner. He served on the Board of Trustees of the LA County Bar Association, the Board of Trustees of the LA County Law Library and the California State Legislature's Task Force on Court Facilities. In the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Krekorian was counsel to the Webster Commission and was appointed to the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission. Krekorian has been praised for his efforts in preserving women's rights for his pro bono work in the fight against domestic violence, and a program he developed for at-risk youth, called GenerationNext. Krekorian lives in the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Tamar, and children Hrag, Andrew and Lori. Early political career Krekorian has spent more than a decade in public service, first as a member of the Burbank School Board and then as a California State Assemblymember. He currently serves as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, representing District 2 in the southeast San Fernando Valley. Council District 2 includes the communities of North Hollywood, Studio City, Valley Glen, Valley Village and parts of Sun Valley and Van Nuys. =Burbank School Board= Krekorian was elected to the Burbank School Board in 2003, serving as president beginning in 2005. Under Krekorian's leadership, the district resolved its most pressing budget problems, saving many educational programs and vital jobs, while still cutting administrative costs. During his tenure, the district significantly improved student attendance and performance, increased teacher pay, launched the Burbank Priority in Education Foundation, and encouraged student nutrition and exercise. Concurrently, Krekorian served as president of the Five Star Education Coalition, a consortium of five suburban school districts that worked to shape state and federal education policy. =California State Assembly= In 2006, Krekorian was elected to the 43rd district of the California State Assembly. During his first term in office, Krekorian held one of the best records in the Assembly with the highest number of bills signed into law by any freshman legislator. He was named Assistant Majority Floor Leader of the State Assembly, the third ranking leadership position in the Assembly, by then-Speaker Karen Bass. Krekorian's legislative priorities included making government more accessible and responsive, saving and creating jobs, protecting the environment and increasing public safety. He created the \\"Government at Your Doorstep\\" program in response to complaints about speeding, graffiti and noise pollution in his district. As the state battled to pass a balanced budget in early 2009, Krekorian authored a historic bill to ensure film and TV production in California stays local. His bill was the first successful tax incentive aimed at saving California jobs by addressing runaway production. On-location feature production increased 9.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012, generating 160 production days in Southern California. Krekorian also introduced legislation that restricted plastic pollution in ocean run-off, expanded renewable energy generation for California public utilities and reduced carbon emissions. He worked closely with local police departments to reduce gang violence, along with crime in his district and throughout the state. In his first Assembly term, Krekorian's Weapons and Ammunition Nuisance Abatement Act of 2007 gave apartment owners greater latitude to evict tenants who harbor guns and ammo. That year, Krekorian also introduced and passed a bill to encourage participation with federal authorities to siphon off the state's stock of weapons. Los Angeles City Council On December 8, 2009, Krekorian won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council, representing Los Angeles City Council District 2. He is the Chair of the city's Budget and Finance Committee and the Ad Hoc Committee on Job Creation, the Vice Chair of the Housing Committee, and sits on the Energy, Climate Change and Environmental Justice Committee, Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee, Executive Employee Relations Committee and the Board of Referred Powers. He also serves on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and Metrolink (Southern California), and sits on the San Fernando Valley Council of Governments, a coalition of leaders advocating for the Valley's two million residents. His campaign officially began on July 10, 2009, when Krekorian officially announced his candidacy to fill the vacant District 2 seat in a special election. The primary was held on September 22, in which Krekorian placed first with 34% of the vote. A run-off was scheduled for December 8 and, aided by support from a number of public safety, environmental and Democratic groups, including Los Angeles Daily News, the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City, the Los Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley, Krekorian soundly defeated Christine Essel with more than 56% of the vote, despite being outspent 2-1 in overall campaign dollars and 13-1 in third-party political committee donations. Since taking office in January 2010, Krekorian has worked to improve the city's finances, ensure government transparency, preserve open space, and restore confidence in local government. He garnered quick praise for his \\"thoughtful\\" approach and \\"decisive\\" action to help his district and the City of Los Angeles. He was overwhelmingly elected to his first full term in 2011 and again in March 2015. In their editorial endorsing his March 2015 campaign, the Los Angeles Times called Krekorian \\"smart, knowledgeable\\" and a \\"voice for fiscal responsibility and responsive government.\\" =City Budget= In 2012, Councilmember Krekorian was tapped to lead the Budget and Finance Committee, inheriting the responsibility of overseeing a multi-billion dollar General Fund budget. He has been a fiscal watchdog for the city and is responsible for reforming LA's finances and putting the city on a path to economic recovery. \\"With every great challenge there is great opportunity, and we must seize this chance to create a municipal government that effectively and efficiently provides the services our residents need and deserve,\\" Councilmember Krekorian said at the time. \\"How we respond to this time of crisis will define Los Angeles for years to come, and the work we do now can and must create a firm foundation upon which to build a strong future for our city.\\" Since taking the helm, he has taken a \\"difficult but responsible approach to solving a $220 million deficit and enhancing the city‚Äôs solvency.\\" When Krekorian took office in 2010, the projected deficit for fiscal year 2014-2015 was more than $1 billion. Since then, he has helped the city reduce costs by more than $800 million, nearly eliminating the entire structural deficit. Under his leadership, the city has also established the highest reserve fund in decades. Krekorian has also made improvements to the budget that benefit our neighborhoods by investing in infrastructure, public safety and people. He has restored needed funds to the Los Angeles Fire Dept., improved library hours, and directed funding toward sidewalk repair, tree trimming, graffiti abatement, neighborhood beautification projects, cleaning up illegally dumped items, and senior and student programs at our city's parks. =Jobs= Krekorian chairs the City Council's Ad Hoc Job Creation Committee, created on July 1, 2015, and sits on the Economic Development Committee. Throughout his tenure, Krekorian has worked to implement changes to the city's policies that will make it easier to do business in Los Angeles, create good jobs for working Angelenos and boost the city's vital economic sectors. He has lowered and simplified the city's confusing business tax, supported tax relief for Internet-based businesses and new car dealers, crafted legislation that encourages the City of Los Angeles to contract with local businesses, cracked down on illegal medical marijuana dispensaries, and pushed for a better, streamlined permitting process for new businesses. Krekorian helped craft the City Council's final plan to raise the city's minimum wage, and took great pains to make sure it was done right, taking into consideration the wants and needs of working families, along with our small businesses and non-profit organizations. =Transportation and Mobility= Krekorian believes that expanding the San Fernando Valley's public transportation system will help grow the economy, create jobs and make life (and commutes) easier for residents. As a member of the Metro and Metrolink boards, he is the Valley's primary voice for increased transit options and better connectivity between neighborhoods. He has advocated for expanding rail and bus transit in the Valley, including improving and possibly converting the Orange Line (Los Angeles Metro) to light rail, completing the East Valley North-South Transit Corridor and Sepulveda Pass projects, linking the Red Line to the Bob Hope Airport and connecting the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys by rail. Krekorian recently inaugurated new, Valley-Westside express bus service over the Sepulveda Pass, cutting daily commutes by 40 minutes. Krekorian has also championed bringing new, less confusing parking signs throughout the city, voted to ban third-party phone apps that sell parking spaces, lifted parking restrictions near elementary schools and supported sensible parking citation reform. =Public Safety and Gun Control= Councilmember Krekorian supports the police and fire departments. He has a long history of fighting for safer streets and communities. Krekorian has restored critical Los Angeles Fire Department services, by championing the hiring of hundreds of firefighters, and providing the department with funding to replace outdated safety equipment and to keep more ambulances on the street. He has prioritized decreasing emergency response times and proposed new ideas to make the fire department more responsive to residents. Krekorian works hand-in-hand with the Los Angeles Police Department on community education programs, by supporting a well-funded and -staffed department, and by fostering strong partnerships between law enforcement officers, elected leaders and neighborhoods. He has also launched campaigns in his district to clean up parks, housing, railroad tracks and alleyways, turning them from hubs of crime into safe public spaces. Krekorian has also taken on graffiti head on with his #NoTag campaign, cleaning up more than one million square feet of graffiti in just 12 months. Krekorian is also known for his strong stand against gun violence and for the safety of children and families. His City Council measures have mandated safe storage for handguns in homes and electronic reporting of ammunition sales, and banned the possession of large- capacity ammunition magazines. On June 15th, 2020, Krekorian refused to make a commitment to defund the police amid overwhelming public support for defunding the police. =Supporting the Arts= For nearly a decade, Krekorian has fought hard for our government to do everything it can to preserve vital film and television jobs in Los Angeles and to stop runaway production. Krekorian recently chaired the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Film and TV Production Jobs, where he successfully lobbied for the state to pass an expanded tax incentive package for film and TV production, saving thousands of jobs and creating billions in local economic activity. He has taken concrete steps to make Los Angeles more film friendly by extending a local tax incentive, waiving fees for filming at city-owned properties, streamlining the permitting process, and helping city departments find more efficient and effective ways to accommodate and assist filming. As a strong advocate for the arts, Krekorian has authored measures to fund public art, protect LA's historic murals (including the Great Wall of Los Angeles in Valley Glen), prevent graffiti vandalism and preserve the city's diverse cultural heritage. Krekorian also supports the next generation of filmmakers. He created the Los Angeles Student Film Festival, the only Southern California film festival featuring the work of high school students. In 2017, Krekorian launched NoHo Summer Nights as a way to bring free, live concerts to North Hollywood Park. =Neighborhood Empowerment= Krekorian is vocal advocate for neighborhood councils and bringing more community involvement to city government. He works closely with the neighborhood councils, associations, watches and all resident organizations in Council District 2. Krekorian believes that these organizations provide a valuable outlet for concerned and committed citizens to voice their opinions about issues considered by the City Council and city departments. Throughout his time at City Hall, Krekorian has fought attempts to excessively curtail neighborhood council funding and has championed their inclusion in the budget process. In 2010, when he chaired the City Council's Education and Neighborhoods Committee, Krekorian restored more than $1 million in rollover funding to neighborhood councils, arguing that a lack of funding \\"would not allow neighborhood councils what they need to meet their commitments.\\" Krekorian is also known for listening to residents and providing top notch constituent services. He responds quickly and decisively when emergencies threaten neighborhoods and when residents are simply looking for assistance. His field office in North Hollywood is a neighborhood center of activity, outreach and information. Krekorian endeavors to bring city government to the doorsteps of his constituents and always welcomes their valuable input. =Environmental Sustainability= Since before was first elected to public office, Krekorian has worked tirelessly to support the restoration of damaged ecosystems, fight global warming, prevent air pollution and promote sustainable development for our city and state. As a City Councilmember, his strong advocacy for sound environmental policies led the way for Los Angeles to become the largest city to ban single-use plastic bags and to prioritize revitalizing the LA River. Krekorian has also opened parks throughout Council District 2, pushed for the city to use and implement green technology and practices, acted to preserve our urban forest and protected our open space. Highlighting his independence, the councilman repeatedly stood with city ratepayers and led the fight against proposed rate increases sought by the Dept. of Water and Power in 2010. In an open letter to constituents explaining his opposition, Krekorian lambasted the Department's lack of transparency and insufficient justification. \\"I voted against the DWP‚Äôs proposal because I wanted to make clear that any rate hikes proposed by the Department must be vetted in the most responsible and transparent fashion,\\" he wrote. Krekorian worked to ensure that a ratepayer advocate - an independent voice for Angelenos on DWP issues - became a reality. In 2017, Krekorian authored a motion that made Los Angeles the largest city in the United States to set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy use. =Community Planning and Development= Krekorian has long stated his support for development projects in his district consistent with the community's needs, but has opposed projects that infringe on the neighborhood's character. On his first day in office, Krekorian took a decisive first step by putting the brakes on a large multifamily development on Magnolia Boulevard in Valley Village that was opposed by neighbors for years. He has also opposed an out-of-character condo development at the Weddington Golf and Tennis complex in Studio City and voiced his desire to have the area contribute to the revitalization of the LA River. Krekorian has worked to reduce the number of billboards in Los Angeles, eliminate mobile billboards - long a headache for Valley residents and clamped down on mansionization in Studio City. His efforts against mansionization led to the city's restrictive Baseline Mansionization Ordinance, which applies in every LA neighborhood.

He is a heavy metal vocalist and occasional bassist, best known for his vocals with Yngwie Malmsteen. His first album with Malmsteen, Trilogy achieved platinum status in the USA and sold several million copies worldwide. As a young child, he learned to play the piano and bass guitar. Although Boals has never had any vocal lessons or training, as a teenager he gained experience as a vocalist in local groups. Boals is the founder and vocalist for the band Ring of Fire, and had a brief stint as the bassist for Dokken. He currently performs lead vocals, guitar and bass in the hit musical show, Raiding the Rock Vault in Las Vegas. Career In 1982, Boals joined Savoy Brown and toured around Canada and the U.S. through 1983. Although several songs were written for a proposed new album, the record never materialized due to mainman Kim Simmonds running into legal problems at the time. During these years Boals also performed with his band Lazer. While with Savoy Brown, Boals met Ted Nugent and joined his band as bassist in 1984 touring throughout the U.S. and opening up for Judas Priest in Europe. Deciding to focus on singing and being a frontman, Boals moved to California in 1985. He joined Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force and performed on the Trilogy album. Boals' first show with Malmsteen was at Day on the Green in San Francisco, CA in front of 80,000 fans. After leaving Yngwie in 1986, he gave up music for a time, trying to find himself in cinematography and working for Warner Brothers. In this period he recorded, with Mike Slamer, a soundtrack for the film White Water Summer (1987); he also appeared on Maestro Alex Gregory's \\"Paganini's Last Stand\\" (Priority Records) in 1992. Boals' next venture was Billionaires Boys Club, a short lived supergroup featuring former Accept guitarist J√∂rg Fischer, future HammerFall bassist Magnus Ros√©n, and former Yngwie Malmsteen bandmate, drummer Anders Johansson. The group's sole album, Something Wicked Comes, was released on Polydor Records in 1993. Then in 1996, Yngwie Malmsteen called Boals and asked if he wanted to perform on several songs on the cover album Inspiration. Boals accepted, and resumed his role as vocalist with Yngwie Malmsteen for the album Alchemy. The band subsequently went on tour. In March 2000, Boals won the No.1 Vocalist Prize in the Japanese music magazines Burrn! and Young Guitar. At the end of that year, on the same day, his second solo CD, entitled Ring Of Fire and Yngwie Malmsteen's War To End All Wars, with Boals on vocals, were released. However, after many years of musical magic and friendship, the team of Malmsteen and Boals had decided to move in different directions, and Boals formed a new band, Ring of Fire, named after his solo album. At the beginning of this year, Ring of Fire recorded their subsequent debut The Oracle album at the George Bellas Studios in Chicago. Alongside Boals were George Bellas, Vitalij Kuprij, Virgil Donati and Philip Bynoe. In addition Boals has participated in two exciting projects of Lion Music in Finland. He appears on the Jason Becker tribute \\"Warmth in the Wilderness\\", singing a version of David Lee Roth's \\"Hammerhead Shark\\" with Lars Eric Mattsson. Speaking about Mattsson, in 2005 he also recorded an album War with Boals lead singing on track \\"Deep In The Shadows\\". As Malmsteen urgently needed a singer for his current tour, Boals has toured again with him in Europe, but only as guest vocalist. Also Boals is featured on vocals on two songs, \\"Into The Light\\" and \\"I Will Always Be There\\", for the Empire CD Hypnotica (2001). Another cool project where Boals took part in, was \\"Genius Rock Opera\\" Trilogy by Daniele Liverani. There he was recording as the main character (Genius) on Episode 1: A human into dreams' world (2002) and Episode 2: In search of the little prince (2004). But he refused to sing on the last Episode because of personal reasons and was replaced by D. C. Cooper.Daniele Liverani ‚Äì Genius Rock Opera Official Web Site In 2004 Boals recorded two songs for young Japanese guitarist named Takayoshi Ohmura. Ohmura's debut album, entitled \\"Nowhere To Go\\", features additional guest appearances by Doogie White (Yngwie Malmsteen, Cornerstone, ex-Rainbow) and Richie Kotzen (ex-Mr. Big, Poison). Commented Boals: > After I was asked by the representatives of Ohmura, I listened to his demo. > I thought his music was good and he has a talent to play guitar, and I > thought it'd be great to support this young Japanese musician. I also > thought it would be great to share the vocals with the other singers, Richie > Kotzen and Doogie White, so I recorded two songs here in L.A. and sent them > to Japan.MARK BOALS Records Guest Appearance For Japanese Guitarist Boals has also performed with Lana Lane, Indigo Dying, Empire and Chris Brooks. In recent years Boals recorded 3 solo albums as well as three studio albums and one live DVD with his own band, Ring Of Fire. The latest project album is entitled The Codex, which Boals recorded with Magnus Karlsson in 2007. The album project marks the return to recording after a 3 years hiatus for Boals.Official Site of Professional Stunt Guitarist Magnus Karlsson In 2007 Boals started looking for a serious, permanent band situation and Royal Hunt became a perfect opportunity for a singer to exploit and expand his vocal abilities.Official Royal Hunt Website In 2008 Boals appeared on his first Royal Hunt album Collision Course... Paradox 2. Boals also appeared on Uli Jon Roth's album titled Under A Dark Sky on which he shared vocal duties with Liz Vandall. The band with Boals toured the world from July ‚Äì December 2008. In 2009, he also worked with such bands like Vindictiv and Wolf, and completed work on the latest Royal Hunt album X which was released in January 2010. Mark is also currently handling vocal duties in the band Seven The Hardway featuring guitarist Tony MacAlpine which released a self-titled album in August 2010. A press release dated June 19, 2011 announced that Boals would be recording vocals for the Wagnerian opera metal project Lyraka.http://www.bravewords.com/news/164045 In 2012, Boals sang lead vocals for Joshua Perahia's band and their album, \\"Resurrection\\". Since 2013, Boals is performing with Dio Disciples, replacing former Judas Priest singer Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. After singing backing vocals on Dokken's 2012 album Broken Bones and performing acoustic shows with Don Dokken for the past couple of years, Boals was announced as the new full-time Dokken bass player in November 2014 replacing Sean McNabb. Boals also appears on an EP project from the band Metal Hell called Decadence, which includes Mark Zonder from Fates Warning Boals currently performs in the Las Vegas show, Raiding the Rock Vault, in which he is one of the lead vocalists, and also plays guitar and bass.

It is a glucoside of acetone cyanohydrin. Upon exposure to enzymes and gut flora in the human intestine, linamarin and its methylated relative lotaustralin can decompose to the toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide; hence food uses of plants that contain significant quantities of linamarin require extensive preparation and detoxification. Ingested and absorbed linamarin is rapidly excreted in the urine and the glucoside itself does not appear to be acutely toxic. Consumption of cassava products with low levels of linamarin is widespread in the low-land tropics. Ingestion of food prepared from insufficiently processed cassava roots with high linamarin levels has been associated with dietary toxicity, particularly with the upper motor neuron disease known as konzo to the African populations in which it was first described by Trolli and later through the research network initiated by Hans Rosling. However, the toxicity is believed to be induced by ingestion of acetone cyanohydrin, the breakdown product of linamarin.Banea-Mayambu JP, Tylleskar T, Gitebo N, Matadi N, Gebre-Medhin M, Rosling H. (1997). Geographical and seasonal association between linamarin and cyanide exposure from cassava and the upper motor neurone disease konzo in former Zaire. Trop Med Int Health 2(12):1143-51. Dietary exposure to linamarin has also been reported as a risk factor in developing glucose intolerance and diabetes, although studies in experimental animals have been inconsistent in reproducing this effectSoto-Blanco B, Marioka PC, Gorniak SL. (2002). Effects of long-term low-dose cyanide administration to rats. Ecotoxicol Environ Saf 53(1):37-41. Soto-Blanco B, Sousa AB, Manzano H, Guerra JL, Gorniak SL. 2001. Does prolonged cyanide exposure have a diabetogenic effect?. Vet Hum Toxicol. 43(2):106-8. and may indicate that the primary effect is in aggravating existing conditions rather than inducing diabetes on its own.Yessoufou A, Ategbo JM, Girard A, Prost J, Dramane KL, Moutairou K, Hichami A, Khan NA. (2002). Cassava-enriched diet is not diabetogenic rather it aggravates diabetes in rats. Fundam Clin Pharmacol 20(6):579-86. The generation of cyanide from linamarin is usually enzymatic and occurs when linamarin is exposed to linamarase, an enzyme normally expressed in the cell walls of cassava plants. Because the resulting cyanide derivatives are volatile, processing methods that induce such exposure are common traditional means of cassava preparation; foodstuffs are usually made from cassava after extended blanching, boiling, or fermentation.Padmaja G. (1995). Cyanide detoxification in cassava for food and feed uses. Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr 35(4):299-339. Food products made from cassava plants include garri (toasted cassava tubers), porridge-like fufu, the dough agbelima, and cassava flour. Research efforts have developed a transgenic cassava plant that stably downregulates linamarin production via RNA interference.Siritunga D, Sayre R (2003). \\"Generation of cyanogen-free transgenic cassava\\".

It formed in 1992 as an offshoot of the ELN. It was named after and inspired by the Argentine Che Guevara. Despite it being an offshoot of the ELN and employing tactics such as kidnapping, the ERG is not designated or watched as a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, Canada or Russia, only by the Government of Colombia. Location The ERG's membership was 45 persons in the day of their surrender. It does not operate nationwide and is considerably smaller than the two main guerrilla groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army. It was active in the Departments of Choc√≥, Risaralda, and Antioquia. Claimed attacks In 1997, the group reportedly asked $500,000 in ransom for six people the group kidnapped from a commercial helicopter in Antioquia. The helicopter was loaded with explosives, and the group reportedly placed mines in the location the people were taken. Three of the individuals kidnapped were recovered on July 30, unharmed, and the group released the helicopter to Colombian troops. On July 27, 2000 (some sources claim the kidnapping occurred on July 25), ERG gunmen kidnapped a member of Doctors Without Borders. The hostage was a French aid worker, and it is unknown what happened to the hostage. After 88 days, the Doctors without Borders volunteer, Ignacio de Torquemada, was released from captivity. The doctor reported that most of his kidnappers were between 15‚Äì20 years old, In particular, he was quoted as calling them a bunch of ‚Äúboys.\\" On August 21, 2001, Joseph Stocker, a Swedish engineer, was reportedly kidnapped by the ERG. Stocker was reportedly on vacation during the time the kidnapping took place. It occurred in the town of Carmen de Atrato. In 2002, the former governor of Choco was reportedly kidnapped by the group. On December 17, 2005, it carried out a joint attack on Colombian police forces in the village of San Marino, with the two larger groups which killed at least six police officers. The group is known to operate mostly in Choc√≥. The ERG has engaged in kidnapping in the past. On February 9, 2007, a Colombian National Army captain held hostage for three years by the group was freed. Notable members Olimpo de Jes√∫s S√°nchez Caro- Olimpo, known as El Viejo, as long as 19 members of the group demobilized in the city of Carmen Del Choco on August 21, 2008. Olimpo reportedly worked for multiple guerilla groups. The group was formed by Olimpo de Jes√∫s S√°nchez Caro along with his brothers Ephraim S√°nchez Carom and Lizardo S√°nchez Caro. The group started with 18 members on October 18, 1993 and eventually evolved to over 400 members. Hector Albeidis Arboleda Buitrago, a nurse for multiple guerilla groups, was reportedly used to issue abortions. Trials and convictions In December 2015, Sanchez Caro was charged with multiple crimes, including kidnappings, murder, forced abortions, and was sentenced to 20 years at the Itagui Prison in Antioquia. Also in December 2015, the Superior Court of Medellin convicted 20 members of the ERG with crimes ranging from, forced abortions, war crimes, illegal recruitment, and the murder of protected people. The government provided medical assistance to any women that needed it after the forced procedure, and offered education, training, and psychological help to those that sought it. Hector Albedis Arboleda Buitrago was handed over to Colombian authorities after being extradited from Spain. Hector was accused of issuing forced abortions to female members. Demobilization In 2008, Luis Carlos Restrepo Ramirez called for the group to demobilize. The announcement ensured that members who decided to demobilize and surrender their weapons would be subjected to the Justice and Peace Law. The Justice and Peace Law, signed in 2005 by President Uribe, the law issues reduced sentences for members and provides an easier route for fighters to rejoin civilian life. MAPP/OEA were responsible for monitoring the demobilization of the group. On August 21, 2008 the group laid down their arms and ceased to exist. The group surrendered 35 light weapons, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and 20 explosives. The group was the first to surrender as a whole due to the Justice and Peace Law.

It is closely related to evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford Ladd Prosser, \\"Comparative Physiology is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy.\\" History Originally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the Krogh Principle. Methodology C. Ladd Prosser, a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in Garland and Carter): 1\\\\. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs. :This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as \\"stamp collecting\\" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase. 2\\\\. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of organisms. :In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or DNA sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms. In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons: :* physiology doesn't leave many fossil cues, :* it can't be measured on museum specimens, :* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and :* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and convergent evolution, which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction. 3\\\\. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments. :This is essentially physiological ecology or ecological physiology. 4\\\\. To identify \\"model systems\\" for studying particular physiological functions. :Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine), and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology. 5\\\\. To use the \\"kind of animal\\" as an experimental variable. : \\"While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function.\\" Prosser (1950, p. 1) : 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: \\"I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable.\\" Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in \\"extreme\\" environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation. One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations. Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to \\"unusual\\" organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter, hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of blood pressure. More generally, ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base balance and pH change as body temperature changes. Funding In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Societies A number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology, including: * American Physiological Society * Australian & New Zealand Society for Comparative Physiology & Biochemistry * Canadian Society of Zoologists * Japanese Society for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry * Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology * Society for Experimental Biology Biographies Knut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915‚Äì2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke University for many years and training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style. Grover C. Stephens (1925‚Äì2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University of Minnesota until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the University of California at Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field (obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.

According to the school, they have enrolled over 40 different nationalities into the school, with 44% of the students being born outside Australia. Its sister school is Shinminato Senior High School. History Noble Park High School was opened by the Department of Education in 1962, following the opening of the nearby Noble Park Technical School in 1957. The school's buildings were constructed by A.V.Jennings in the Light Timber Construction (LTC) style, and clad with pebble-encrusted cement tiles. The cost of the contract for the first and second sections of the school was ¬£84,389. The third section was constructed later, providing the school with two LTC classroom wings and an LTC technical block, all of which remain in use today. In the early 1990s, the school's name was changed to Noble Park Secondary College, and the Noble Park Technical School was closed. Grounds and facilities The school contains three light timber construction wings ('A', 'B' & 'C') as well as an administration wing, a library and a hall. NPSC also features a separate basketball & tennis courts, a hockey field (though it is more commonly used for Soccer) and a football oval, with a cricket pitch featured inside of it during the cricket season. Uniform The Noble Park Secondary College uniform is white shirts, red jumpers and black pants for Yrs 7-10. For VCE students, it is the same however a black jumper is worn. This is to distinguish them from the junior years. Student representation The school's main form of student representation is via the SRC (Student Representative Council). Elections are held in Late-February, with students elected from their subsequent form class. Up to 2 students can be elected from any one form, resulting in around 10 students nominated throughout each year level. After this stage, the entire year level conducts in a secret ballot, and from that 3 students are elected for each year level. SRC members play an important role amongst the school population, deciding on important matters that have been either been brought up by members or by the School Council, a group of parents, teachers and the principal.

The park consists, in effect, of a group of 4 small sub-lakes linked by bridges in the traditional style. The lake was originally a water reservoir for the city. Green Lake is ringed by a street, and along the edge of that are restaurants and tea houses (some with rooftop dining), shops, and hotels, including the upscale Green Lake Hotel and Grand Park Hotel (formerly the Harbour Plaza Hotel). During the winter months, black-headed gulls from Siberia migrate to Green Lake and entertain the crowds of visitors as they circle around and snap up bread, usefully provided by a herd of local vendors, thrown up into the air by tourists. There are performances of pieces from Chinese operas and of folk music within and around the park. Located in the park is the statue of one of Yunnan's most famous patriots - Nie Er, the composer of China's national anthem. Green Lake Park was visited during The Amazing Race 18 when the park was featured as the \\"Pit Stop\\" of the 5th leg. The park is just below the main gate to Yunnan University. The most famous building on the lake is Jiang Wu Tang, a tourist attraction.

Type III PKSs are associated with the production of chalcones, a class of organic compounds found mainly in plants as natural defense mechanisms and as synthetic intermediates. CHS was the first type III PKS to be discovered. It is the first committed enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to naringenin chalcone.  Function  CHS catalysis serves as the initial step for flavonoid biosynthesis. Flavonoids are important plant secondary metabolites that serve various functions in higher plants. These include pigmentation, UV protection, fertility, antifungal defense and the recruitment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. CHS is believed to act as a central hub for the enzymes involved in the flavonoid pathway. Studies have shown that these enzymes interact via protein-protein interactions. Through FLIM FRET, it was shown that CHS interacts with chalcone isomerase (CHI), a consecutive step enzyme, as well as other non-consecutive step enzymes flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and flavonol synthase I. Naringenin- chalcone synthase uses malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA to produce CoA, naringenin chalcone, and CO2.  Reaction  600px 4-coumaroyl-CoA and three units of malonyl-CoA are converted into three molecules of carbon dioxide, four molecules of coenzyme A and one unit of naringenin chalcone.  Structure  = Subunits = CHS exists as a homodimeric protein with each monomer approximately 42-45 kDa in size. Each monomer possesses a Œ≤-keto synthase (KS) activity that catalyzes the sequential head to tail incorporation of two- carbon acetate units into a growing polyketide chain. CHS contains a five layer Œ±Œ≤Œ±Œ≤Œ± core, a location of the active site and dimerization interface that is highly similar to thiolase-fold containing enzymes. The dimerization interface contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues and is generally flat except for a pair of N-terminal helices that lay entwined across the top. Although the helices are not involved in reaction, they may contain intracellular localization signals as in yeast thiolase. They may also undergo a conformational change to participate in the formation of transient multi- protein complexes with other enzymes in the various pathways diverging from the general phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. =Localization= The enzyme is localized in the cytosol, associating with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In another study, it was shown that CHS and CHI co-localize at the nucleus as well. = Active site = There are two distinct bi-lobed active site cavities located at the bottom edge of each monomer‚Äôs Œ±Œ≤Œ±Œ≤Œ± core. Identical six-residue loops, which meet at the dimer interface, separate the two active sites from each other. The loops being with Thr132 in the active site and ends with a cis-peptide bond to Pro138. A Met137 residue plugs a hole in the other monomer‚Äôs active site. Therefore, the active site is buried except for a 16 √Ö CoA-binding tunnel that connects the catalytic surface to the outer surrounding milieu. The width of the tunnel is too narrow for the aromatic substrates and products that must pass through it, implying that there must be some dynamic mobility within and around the tunnel when placed in solution. The active site contains a conserved catalytic triad of Cys164, His303 and Asn336. These residues aid in multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions, with Cys164 acting as the active site nucleophile. Phe215 and Phe265 are two other important amino acids that act as ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù to block the lower protein of the opening between the CoA- binding tunnel and the active site cavity. This limits the access of water to the active site while accommodating substrates and intermediates of varying shapes and sizes. Phe215 also orients the substrates at the active site during elongation of the polyketide intermediate.  Mechanism  The first step involves a transfer of a coumaroyl moiety from a 4-coumaroyl-CoA starter molecule to Cys164. Next, a series of condensation reactions of three acetate units from malonyl-CoA occurs, each proceeding through an acetyl-CoA carbanion derived from malonyl-CoA decarboxylation. This extends the polyketide intermediate. After the generation of a thioester-linked tetraketide, a regiospecific C1,C6 Claisen condensation occurs, forming a new ring system to generate naringenin chalcone.  Regulation = Metabolic = CHS is noncompetitively inhibited by flavanoid pathway products such as naringenin and chalcone naringenin. Despite lack of direct evidence in vivo, flavonoids are believed to accumulate in the cytosol to a level that blocks CHS activity to avoid toxic levels in plants. = Transcriptional = CHS is constitutively expressed in plants but can also be subject to induced expression through light/ UV light and well as in response to pathogens, elicitors and wounding. The CHS promoter contains a G-box motif with a sequence of CACGTG. This has been shown to play a role in response to light. Other light sensitive domains include Box I, Box II, Box III, Box IV or three copies of H-box (CCTACC). The chalcone synthase gene of Petunia plants is famous for being the first gene in which the phenomenon of RNA interference was observed; researchers intending to upregulate the production of pigments in light pink or violet flowers introduced a transgene for chalcone synthase, expecting that both the native gene and the transgene would express the enzyme and result in a more deeply colored flower phenotype. Instead the transgenic plants had mottled white flowers, indicating that the introduction of the transgene had downregulated or silenced chalcone synthase expression. Further investigation of the phenomenon indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of the chalcone synthase gene expression via an increased rate of messenger RNA degradation.  Disease relevance  CHS, as the first committed step in the flavonoid pathway, facilitate production of flavanoids, isoflavonoid-type phytoalexins and other metabolites to protect the plant from stress. CHS expression is also involved in the salicyclic acid defense pathway. Being aromatic compounds, flavonoids strongly absorb UV light through a photoreceptor-mediated mechanism which effectively protects the plants from DNA damage. CHS is involved in a broader, more general phenylpropanoid pathway which serve as precursors to a range of plant metabolites important to human health such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, antiallergens, and even antioncogenic products.  Evolution  CHS belongs to a broader class of enzymes known as type III PKSs. Being the first enzyme of its type to be discovered, all other members are often labeled as ‚ÄúCHS-like.‚Äù Most or all of the divergent CHS-like enzymes characterized have arisen from extensive duplication and subsequent genetic variation of the chs gene. Duplication provides CHS activity with functional redundancy, allowing the chs gene to mutate without endangering flavonoid biosynthesis. These divergent enzymes differ from CHS in their preference for starter molecules, the number of acetyl additions (often through malonyl-CoA) and even in the mechanism of ring formation used to cyclize identical polyketide intermediates. The enzyme function of CHS and CHS-like enzymes function very similarly to fatty acid biosynthesis, but without the involvement of acyl-carrier proteins (ACP). Structural evidence suggests that these enzymes emerged by gain of function from ketoacyl synthase (KAS) III, an early stage enzyme of type II fatty acid biosynthesis. Although higher plant chalcone synthases have been extensively studied, little information is available on the enzymes from bryophytes (primitive plants). Cloning of CHS from the moss Physcomitrella patens revealed an important transition from the chalcone synthases present in microorganisms to those present in higher plants.

They are said to exist on different planes of existence simultaneously, and in the Palladium hierarchy of powers, most Alien Intelligences, apart from the Vampire Intelligences, are more powerful than the mightiest Gods in Palladium. In fact, some of the most powerful Gods of the Palladium Megaverse were themselves spawned by the Alien Intelligences. Morality in Alien Intelligences Alien Intelligences are perceived by the vast majority of sentient beings everywhere in the Megaverse as creatures of pure evil intent, and with good reason. While many (perhaps most) Alien Intelligences do indeed gain a great deal of amusement from the suffering of other beings, for the vast majority of Intelligences, the simple fact of the matter is that they consider themselves as far above most sentient beings as those sentient beings consider themselves above pets and livestock, and treat those beings as such. Even Gods, Angels, Demons, and lesser Alien Intelligences are potentially susceptible to being treated as nothing more than pawns, slaves, and in some cases, food. Types of Alien Intelligences =\\"Generic\\" Alien Intelligences= Most Alien Intelligences follow the standard template: a fleshy mound that may or may not take any recognizable shape, a single eye in the middle of the mass of flesh (although there can be hundreds or even thousands of these; most Intelligences don't actually need these eyes to see), and in many cases, a series of tentacles protruding from the Main Body. \\"Generic\\" Alien Intelligences have the ability to possess the bodies of \\"willing\\" hosts (in most cases any essence fragment that is taken into a host body will forever destroy or consume the original personality and/or soul of anyone tricked into accepting such a deal), the raising, controlling, and/or turning of large numbers of dead, most of the standard abilities of Palladium Gods, and the ability to send out a limited number of essence fragments to better interact with the physical world around them-although these fragments must merge with physical matter in order to be of any use. =Vampire Intelligences= In the Palladium Megaverse, Vampire Intelligences are seemingly the most numerous of their kind, and potentially the most dangerous, especially with the fall of the Old Ones that kept them in check. They are actually minor Old Ones but were deemed too \\"weak\\" in comparison to the other Old Ones and were not included in the super-spell that put the Old Ones and many of the greater Intelligences to sleep. Due to the virulent nature of their existence and the universal hatred throughout the Megaverse of vampiric infestation, Vampire Intelligences are hated by almost every sentient being in the Megaverse, from the least to the most powerful, and from the most stalwart Champions of Light to the most evil Devils and Demons. Very, very rarely does any other creature ever willingly work with or for them. Vampire Intelligences are notable amongst Alien Intelligences in that they can produce an unlimited number of essences (which fuses with a mortal, living creature to form a Vampire), and that the essence fragments can, if so desired, create a corporeal servant-a last line of defense within the Vampire Intelligence's lair-without the need to possess a living victim (most essence fragments are intangible in form and must bond to a solid body in order to interact with the physical world in any way). Vampire Intelligences are, however, much weaker than their brethren in terms of both mystic might and damage capacity. =Elemental Intelligences= Most if not all Greater Elementals summoned by Warlocks, Shifters, and Elemental Fusionists (a name that some Warlocks prefer to be called by), are actually fragments of Elemental Intelligences themselves. Elemental Intelligences are noteworthy amongst Intelligences, and most sentient life in general, in that they have absolutely no comprehension of morality, one way or the other. Elemental Intelligences cannot comprehend most human emotions-apart from anger-and never ever engage in any activity, good or evil, for pleasure. An Elemental Intelligence, asked or commanded by another being to retrieve an object from point B, will start from point A and simply tear through a village of women and children without the slightest regret: it cannot comprehend why it is \\"wrong\\" to kill the innocent, and it has no comprehension of life or death, good or evil. To date, no Elemental Intelligence has been given stats in Palladium Canon, but their essence fragments are moderately powered by Alien Intelligence standards. This might indicate that the powers of Elemental Intelligences rival or exceed those of their brethren. =Zllyphan= A \\"sub-species\\" of Alien Intelligences whose essence fragments can only bond with the now-soulless bodies of the recently deceased. Despite that limitation, there is no apparent limit to the number of bodies that they can reanimate in this manner, the bodies themselves are restored to the appearance of full health and vigor, and furthermore any and all of those bodies are for all intents and purposes that of the Intelligence itself; everything that they see or hear the Main Body of the Intelligence sees and hears also. Currently in Rifts Earth, on the land once known as British Isles, a Zllyphan named Zazshan has successfully re-created the legend of the Knights of the Round Table; his essence fragments are simultaneously masquerading as the Lady Guinevere, the Sorcerer Merlin, a cadre of the inner circle of Knights, and even as the Lady of the Lake-all of whom seemingly act on their own separate \\"agendas\\". Zllyphan are relatively low-powered for Alien Intelligences (although still considerably more powerful than Vampire Intelligences). =Splugorth= The most successful and well-organized of the Alien Intelligences, this sub-species of Alien Intelligences follow the \\"generic\\" template for Intelligences in every way, including massive damage capacity (surpassing that of all but the most powerful of Gods), the ability to send out a limited number of essence fragments, create Witches (which they typically and almost exclusively do in the form of the Splugorth High Lords), and host of other capabilities. As a species, their might is exceeded only by that of unique Intelligences such as Apsu, Nxla, and the Lord of the Deep. The Splugorth are confined principally to the Rifts Game Setting, and their past relationship of these creatures to the dreaded Old Ones, if any, is unknown. =Unique/Greater Alien Intelligences= There are one-of-a-kind Intelligences in the Palladium Megaverse that dwarf the power of the Gods and even most other Intelligences. Fortunately for the Megaverse, these beings are few and far between, and they are generally hated and plotted against even by other powerful Intelligences, if for no other reason than that these Greater Intelligences would likely enslave or destroy the lesser ones. These beings include but are not limited to: Cronus, Nxla, the Lord of the Deep, Apsu, Tikilik, the Rainbow Serpent, the Tarnow Crystal Intelligence (implied to have been imprisoned in the crystal as a punishment by the Old Ones themselves), Devy'Orhal, the Conqueror, Zurvan, and the Dweller Beneath. =The Old Ones= The most powerful of all Alien Intelligences, the Old Ones were the creators of the \\"science\\" of magic, the inventors of Rune Wizardry, and possess the same standard abilities of most Intelligences, only on a far greater level (they each have millions of points of Mega Damage Capacity, for example). It took the combined martial and mystic might of thousands of races and billions of sentient beings throughout the Megaverse to defeat them....and the effort might have failed even then had not one of the Old Ones' number been present to cast the super-spell that put them to sleep. They could not be destroyed, for fear that the resulting magical backlash would destroy all creation. Powers and abilities Alien Intelligences can, for the most part, enjoy many of the powers and abilities of Gods, including but not limited to Deific Perception (the ability to tell what manner of creature another being is just by looking at it, no matter what disguise it currently wears), effortless inter-Dimensional teleportation, the summoning of attendant minions from anywhere in the Megaverse to do its bidding, and a wide range of other Prototypical Deific powers. Unlike Gods, however, Alien Intelligences don't need the worship of sentient beings in order to continue to exist. Most Intelligences can grant powers to favored minions through Witchery pacts as Gods can: in return for varying degrees of servitude, Intelligences can grant these Witches the ability to cast magic, can vastly increase the physical strength and ability of these minions to withstand physical damage, and in a few select cases the Intelligences can grant a longer life span or even immortality to these loyal servants. One of the Intelligences' most significant abilities, however, is their capability to splinter the essence of their being into multiple Essence Fragments; these fragments are not just a piece of the Intelligence that spawned it, they actually are the Intelligence itself; everything that these fragments ever see or do, the Intelligence sees and does. The amount of essence fragments that a given Intelligence can dispatch at one time are limited by the \\"species\\" of Intelligence, although some special types of Intelligences such as the Vampire Intelligences, the Zllyphan Intelligences, and unique Intelligences like Nxla can create a potentially unlimited number of these. Weaknesses For all their vast range of powers, Alien Intelligences have weaknesses all their own. Physically, they cannot alter their form to create a seemingly more fair appearance to mortals, as Gods can do: they have to possess the bodies of other sentient beings to walk among them, and some Intelligences are incapable of even that. They also cannot, for the most part, see through the eyes of their worshippers as Gods can, nor do they possess the unique ability of Palladium Gods to create viable offspring with other lifeforms (in fact, Alien Intelligences cannot reproduce sexually with other species at all). Alien Intelligences seem to reproduce very slowly, if \\"reproduction\\" is the proper term to use at all; some Intelligences in canon, such as the ruler of Rifts Atlantis known as Splynncryth, are given an age which implies a date of origin or birth, but the means by which the Intelligences replenish their numbers remains an unknown at present. In any event, it appears to be a slow process: in Palladium Books canon, less than a hundred or so Alien Intelligences are cited throughout the entire Megaverse, and the fear and hatred of these beings makes them prime targets for revenge, treachery, and even assassination-often at the hands of other, rival Intelligences. Arguably, their greatest weakness, however, is not physical but mental. In holding \\"lesser\\" creatures in such low regard, Alien Intelligences frequently underestimate the ingenuity of the sentient pets, slaves, and livestock below them, and have on more than one occasion been defeated and even destroyed at the hands of an unanticipated insurrection against their rule. Even the Old Ones themselves, far and away the mightiest beings ever to exist in the Palladium Megaverse, were lulled into a false sense of security, and were eventually defeated by a Megaversal uprising that they never expected. Furthermore, many of those participating in the rebellion were their trusted minions.

The program was modeled after the \\"Steigerschulen\\" of Germany. Mr. Coxe examined The \\"Steigerschulen\\", which were secondary technical institutes, while studying mining engineering in that country.MMI Alumni Bulletin published 1954 The first class consisted of 11 students. The present day name of MMI Preparatory School came to be in the 1970s as young women were accepted into the school and to more accurately reflect the school's function of preparing students for the rigors of college academics. History On May 7, 1879 Eckley B. Coxe, the son of a prominent Philadelphia judge and the owner of a large mining area, opened his own school - the Industrial School for Miners and Mechanics. Twenty-nine male applicants, ranging in age from 12 to 24 walked into a small two-story building in Drifton, PA, seeking an education. Eighteen were rejected due to the school's high standards. Of the 11 who were accepted, eight successfully completed their first year. The first instructor was O.J. Heinrich. He was succeeded by John R. Wagner, who also managed the school until 1893 when Coxe selected a Board of Directors to manage the school. =Early Curriculum= At the time, classes were held two hours a night, six nights a week. When the mines were closed, students met for six hours a day. They studied spelling, reading, writing, grammar, composition, algebra, bookkeeping, geometry, trigonometry, mechanical drawing, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, drafting, mining, and other courses. The curriculum was designed to produce intelligent foremen, not engineers. Coxe often had to go to Europe for the technical training he needed, and he wished to make it available in the United States. =Remodeling= In 1888, a fire completely destroyed the Drifton school. The school reopened, now called the Miners and Mechanics' Institute of Freeland, Pennsylvania, on March 16, 1893. It was located on the third floor of a building on Centre St in Freeland. Within five weeks, the board of directors decided to lease eight more rooms in another building to accommodate increasing enrollment. It was at this meeting that the name of the school was changed yet again, to the Mining and Mechanical Institute of Freeland. Coxe delivered the Founder's Day Address on May 31, 1893. The school was incorporated in Luzerne County Court on July 31, 1894. Coxe began offering scholarships for the school's best students. The school began offering day classes in 1893. =Growth= Enrollment at MMI continued to grow, and in December 1902, the front wing of the new school was built where MMI stands today. It was largely funded through contributions from Eckley Coxe's wife, Sophia Georgianna Coxe. Classes started in the new wing in the spring of 1903. In 1914, Mrs. Coxe funded the construction of the rear wing of the existing building, which housed the chemistry and physics laboratories. She also funded the construction of the gymnasium across the street in 1925. She continued to help subsidize student tuition costs. =Effects of Political Upheaval= During the Great Depression, night school enrollments dropped off. The night school briefly reopened between 1940 and 1950, but after World War II, it was closed again for lack of enrollment. =Fire of 1964= In 1946, the front and rear wing were joined by an addition. In 1964, the main building was gutted by fire. On June 9, hours before graduation, smoke was seen coming out of the tower. By 3:00 P.M., the tower had fallen and burned. The roof caved in. The interior of the front wing was completely destroyed, but the rear wing and all school records (dating back to 1893) were saved. During the commencement exercises, the board of directors promptly announced the school would be rebuilt. On October 30, the newly restored building was dedicated. =Acceptance of Women= In 1970, the school began accepting young women. The name of the school was changed to MMI Preparatory School because officials felt that the old name did not adequately describe the school's function or mission, which was to prepare students for the rigors of college academics. =Basketball Championship= The Preppers 1973 boys' basketball squad won a state basketball championship, the first and only independent school to do so. =Expansions= In 1977, MMI expanded its curriculum by adding a 7th and 8th grade (Mid-School) to the Preparatory School. The Century II Building, containing the cafetorium, computerized library, science labs, and modern classrooms, opened in 1979. In 1996, the school spent a quarter-million dollars on a new computer lab, which a state computer consultant termed \\"one of the most rich and full-featured networks in the state.\\" The project was largely funded through alumni contributions and outside donations. For the first time in its 120-year history, MMI Preparatory School opened its doors to sixth grade students at the start of the 1999-2000 school year. The first class had 20 students and was taught by Mrs. Maria Greco. In 1999, work began on a $4.6 million expansion project that added a new Science/Technology wing and a new Athletic and Drama Complex. The Old Main Building was also remodeled at this time. The building project was funded through a bond issue secured through the Hazleton Industrial Development Authority, as well as private donations. This project marked the largest, single private investment made in the local area at that time. In 2009, MMI announced its plans to build a $3 million privately funded sports complex on of undeveloped land in Foster Township. The complex, which consists of high school regulation-size baseball, softball and soccer grass turf fields as well as several nature trails that also serve as cross country courses, was completed in 2011, and was used for sports games beginning in the 2011-2012 school year. In 2011, the school began construction on a new library open to students and the public after school hours. The new building, officially named the Joseph A. Turri Library and Learning Center, was funded in large part by MMI Class of 1945 graduate Joseph A. Turri. After its groundbreaking in December 2011, many local legislative officials visited the library construction site, including Pennsylvania State Representative Tara Toohil and Pennsylvania State Senator John Yudichak. The library's design was greatly inspired by the Linderman Library at Lehigh University and features cathedral ceilings, pillars and a fireplace. Curriculum Every core course offered at MMI holds the Honors distinction, demonstrating the coursework is in-depth and comprehensive. In addition, MMI offers multiple Advanced Placement courses designed to prepare students for college-level classes. Students are also offered a wide variety of electives to choose from, distributed across every core subject. Athletics MMI is a member of the Wyoming Valley Conference of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Though MMI is better known for the academic performance of its students than for their athletic performances, the 1973 MMI boys' basketball team became the first and only private school in Pennsylvania to win a state championship. Despite this, the school is well equipped with a tennis court, basketball court and volleyball court. A new sports complex completed in 2011 offers a full soccer field, baseball field, Softball Field, and cross-country trail that also serves as a public nature trail. School Statistics According to the school's website and several press releases, MMI has an average of 95% of every graduating class moving on to college. For example, the graduating class of 1998 had at least four students who did not finish degrees for various reasons). Many MMI graduates have gone on to earn CPAs, MDs, MBAs, and PhDs. The school was and still is an institution that was founded on the concept that one had to work to pay for their education. From the time the school was founded, students were responsible for shoveling anthracite coal to heat the school, clean the floors like janitors, clear and clean chalkboards, and also to maintain the Eckley B. Coxe Home, situated approximately one-half mile away from the school. Outdoor landscaping, gardening as well as exterior repairs were also the responsibility of the students to maintain after school hours were over and during the summertime. Some students participate in a Work-Study Program that is both after school hours and during the summer to help pay for their education, as per the historically founded reason for the school. Many teachers currently hold a master's degree in their specialty of teaching. Notable staff formerly included Mr. Gennaro, who achieved a BS and MS from SUNY in New York. Mr. Genarro helped establish a molecular biology laboratory and included, in his teachings, how to make E. coli bacteria become ampicillin-resistant as well as glow in the dark, under UV light. He also taught laboratory methodology and introduced the students to protein electrophoresis, how to titrate acids and bases, and how to use cutting edge equipment, such as micropipettors.

Edited by Fred R. Shapiro, it was published by Yale University Press in 2006 with a foreword by Joseph Epstein, . Prior to publication it was referred to by its working title, The Yale Dictionary of Quotations. The book presents over 12,000 quotations on 1067 pages. It is arranged alphabetically by author (or, for some quotations, by quotation type), with some information as to the source of each quotation and, where the editor deems this relevant, cross-references to other quotations. A keyword index allows the reader to generally find quotations by significant words in the quotations.  Different focus  As described in its introduction, The Yale Book of Quotations is characterized by its greater focus, relative to its nearest competitors, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations and The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, on modern American quotations, including those that do not have conventional literary sources. These include quotations from politicians, judges, journalists, sportscasters, athletes, screenwriters, songwriters, and anonymous sources. There are special sections for some kinds of quotations, including advertising slogans, film lines, folk and anonymous songs, political slogans, proverbs, and television catchphrases. There is also coverage of traditional literary sources. There are, for example, 400 quotations from the Bible, 106 quotations from Charles Dickens, 127 quotations from T. S. Eliot, 153 quotations from Mark Twain, and 455 quotations from William Shakespeare. This coverage is less extensive than that offered by Bartlett's, which provides 1,642 quotations from the Bible and 1,906 from Shakespeare.  Research into origins  The Yale Book of Quotations' introduction also exhaustively describes the editor's attempts at research to identify many famous quotations, trace them to their original sources as far as possible, and record those sources as precisely and accurately as he could. In compiling the book, Shapiro made extensive use of online databases to find earlier or more precise information about famous quotations. He also used the Stumpers network of reference librarians and other research professionals; and the American Dialect Society electronic mailing list, as well as traditional library research. Shapiro claims that, to ensure that famous quotations were included, he reviewed more than a thousand previous quotations collections and other types of anthologies, read the alt.quotations newsgroup and other Internet and online resources for a while, and consulted experts on famous authors and types of literature.  Correcting misattributions  Shapiro's research resulted in some interesting findings, on occasion correcting misattributions elsewhere. The following are representative: *It was the Earl of Sandwich and the English actor and playwright Samuel Foote who had the exchange \\"I think, that you must either die of the p-x, or the halter.\\" \\"My lord, that will depend upon one of two contingencies; whether I embrace your lordship's mistress, or your lordship's principles.\\" The Yale Book of Quotations traces this to an 1809 source. Bartlett's Familiar Quotations attributed the exchange to Sandwich and John Wilkes, based upon a 1935 book. *\\"Go West, young man\\" was indeed by Horace Greeley. As The Yale Book of Quotations describes in a detailed note, many reference works, including Bartlett's and The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, wrongly attribute it to John Soule. *\\"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\" is traced to the Reno Evening Gazette on January 22, 1942, in the form \\"such a thing as a 'free' lunch never existed.\\" Such a finding would have been unlikely without the use of electronic databases.Fred R. Shapiro, \\"On Language - Quote ... Misquote\\", NYTimes.com, July 21, 2008.Fred R. Shapiro (ed.), The Yale Book of Quotations, Yale University Press, 2006, p. 478. (Subsequent to the publication of the book, Shapiro reported the discovery of a 1938 use of the phrase.Shapiro, Fred (). \\"Quotes Uncovered: The Punchline, Please\\". New York Times ‚Äì Freakonomics blog, July 16, 2009) *The remark that Fred Astaire \\"was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, . . . backwards and in high heels\\" has been attributed to Ann Richards, Linda Ellerbee, or Faith Whittlesey. Shapiro found that the earliest reference was in the Frank and Ernest comic strip on May 3, 1982, and he contacted the strip's creator, Bob Thaves, to confirm that Thaves was the originator.

Tschebotarioff, (February 28, 1899 ‚Äì 1985), was a Russian-born civil engineer and prolific author. His memoir Russia, My Native Land recounted his experiences as a boy and young man in Russia, where he served in the military during World War I.  Biography  Tschebotarioff was born in Pavlovsk, Russia, the son of Porphyry Grigorievich Chebotarev (1873‚Äì1920), an officer of the Don Cossack Guard Battery stationed at Pavlovsk, and his wife Valentina Ivanovna, the daughter of a former Army doctor. His mother, Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, served as a Red Cross nurse at a hospital in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia with Tsarina Alexandra. Tschebotarioff published his mother's wartime journal in Russia, My Native Land and in other publications. When he became an American citizen in 1941, he retained the German spelling of his last name. He studied in Imperial School of Jurisprudence and volunteered to Mikhailovskaya artillery school, completing its shortened wartime course in December 1916. He served at the front of World War I with the Don cossack artillery battery in 1917. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and his parents' deaths a few years apart from typhus, Tschebotarioff was left responsible for his younger sister Valentina. He eventually arranged for the young girl to be cared for by her godmother, Baroness Sophie von Medem, in Germany. He completed his studies to become an engineer at the Berlin Institute of Technology. Later he worked as an engineer in Cairo, Egypt for seven years. In 1937 he obtained a position at Princeton University in New Jersey. He eventually became a full professor of civil engineering at Princeton. In 1955 he became an associate of King & Gavaris, a New York civil engineering consulting firm. Tschebotarioff was the author of a number of books and scientific journal articles in his field. He married Florence Dorothy Bill, the daughter of historian Alfred H. Bill, in 1938. His sister Valentina married one of Florence's brothers.

She took a master's degree in information science at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at The Rockley Group full-time. Involvement with the STC In the mid-1980s, Rockley took the initiative to revive the Toronto chapterToronto STC of the Society for Technical Communication, a professional organization for technical communicators, by getting in touch with the international organization's representative for her area, Rennie Charles. The chapter was founded in 1959 but had been dormant for several years.History of Toronto STC She and Michelle Hutchinson, another technical communicator, assembled a group of their colleagues and presented a plan to hold regular meetings, find speakers of interest, and develop services for technical communicators. The chapter has been active ever since. Among other things, Rockley served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and was general manager for a very successful three-day, multi-stream conference in 1989. (Hutchinson served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and organized the hosting of the international society's annual conference in 1997.) When Toronto hosted the international conference, Rockley proposed producing the conference proceedings on CD as well as in book form. She also volunteered to produce the CDs for the 2500 attendees. That was the first time it had been done. The machine-readable format proved to be so popular that it has been provided in one form or another ever since. Rockley regularly presents papers and workshops at the annual meeting of the international Society for Technical Communication.

Biography  Whittington was born in Adelaide, South Australia, in 1953. He studied music at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, where his piano teacher was Clemens Leske Sr. In the 1970s Whittington began performing contemporary music in Adelaide, performing music by George Crumb, Christian Wolff, Terry Riley, Cornelius Cardew, Howard Skempton, James Tenney, Alvin Curran, Alan Hovhaness, Terry Jennings, Peter Garland, Claude Vivier, Morton Feldman and other contemporary composers. He promoted the music of Australian composers, some of whom were resident in Adelaide, including Quentin Grant, David Kotlowy and Raymond Chapman-Smith, both solo and with the Breakthrough Piano Quartet. In 2011 Whittington played the music of Erik Satie at a concert held in the Elder Hall at the University of Adelaide. In addition to writing an essay on Vexations, he has participated in a number of performances, including Vienna (2009), and Annecy (2010). In 1988 Whittington produced the Breakthrough Festival, a 3-day event of experimental music at the Adelaide College of Arts and Education, which presented works by Morton Feldman, James Tenney, Malcolm Goldstein, Christian Wolff, Alvin Curran and Australian composers. It included a performance of Cage's 4'33\\" on twenty pianos. He also formed the ensemble Breakthrough, which gave the first performances in Australia of major works by Simeon ten Holt (Horizon), Steve Reich, Morton Feldman, Peter Garland. The ensemble also commissioned new works from Australian composers.http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/about/history/1990_adelaide_festival It also played arrangements of popular music from The Doors, The Beatles and Joy Division. In 1989 he visited and performed in the United Kingdom. Encounters with composers there further determined the direction of his own work as pianist and composer. Windmill, a work for string quartet from 1991 in which the players mimicked the sound of rusty windpumps. Music journalist Graham Strahle wrote of the piece \\"If Australia has produced a classic piece of musical minimalism, this is it, expressing our love affair with the bush.\\" Through the 1990s Whittington continued to be active as a performer and composer, and had a strong influence on the direction of contemporary musical development in Adelaide. He organised the visits to Adelaide of Howard Skempton (1991), Peter Garland (1992), and Philip Corner (1995). He also performed an epic series of concerts featuring the piano works of Morton Feldman, including Triadic Memories, Palais de Mari, and For Bunita Marcus. His performance of Triadic Memories was listed by The Wire as one of 60 Concerts that shook the world, along with performances by Sonic Youth, Sun Ra, La Monte Young and others. In 2000 he performed his one-man show The Last Meeting of the Satie Society at the Adelaide Festival. In 2003 he produced a new one-man show Mad Dogs and Surrealists, and in 2006 Interior Voice: Music and Rodin, both initially conceived for the Art Gallery of South Australia. In 2009 he premiered a new multimedia performance, Rhythmus 09, including films by Man Ray, Viking Eggeling, Hans Richter and Marcel Duchamp, performed with music by Erwin Schulhoff, Stefan Wolpe, John Cage and Whittington himself. In 2011 he produced The Music of Light, an exploration of the relationship between film and music in the work of Stan Brakhage, with music by J.S. Bach, Josef Matthias Hauer, James Tenney, Alexander Scriabin, Philip Corner and Whittington. Other interdisciplinary events that he has organised include Psychedelic Rays of Sound(2011) and Infinite Horizons in Sound(2012). On 5 September 2012, he organised John Cage Day in Adelaide to commemorate the 100th birthday of a composer who has had a decisive influence on him. This included an 8-hour long performance on the organ of ASLSP, and a Musicircus that included, amongst other things, Concert for Piano and Orchestra, Aria 2, Cheap Imitation and The Seasons. His compositions include many genres and styles, and reveal diverse musical influences from experimental music to traditional music from many cultures and popular music. Interests in Indian music and Indonesian gamelan also developed in the 1980s. His interest in using technology dates back to the 1970s, and he has also worked with film and multimedia.https://www.marion.sa.gov.au/cove-civic-centre He has also performed frequently as an improvising musician, playing piano and other instruments. His close association with French music has continued with appearances in France at the Printemps musical d'Annecy (2010) and the festival Turbulences sonores (2012) in Montpellier. Whittington currently teaches at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, University of Adelaide, where he directs the Electronic Music Unit (EMU), and teaches composition and theory.

Hughes is the former Speaker of the House for the House of Representatives in the state of Utah. He announced that he would not be seeking reelection as Speaker of the House or as a representative in 2018. Early life and education Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Hughes never knew his father and was brought up by a single mother who sold cemetery plots on commission. She joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and married when Hughes was five, but the marriage ended in divorce by the time he was ten. At age 16, Hughes was in a car accident with friends, and was subsequently confined to a wheelchair for a year. He later worked as a bellman in an upscale Pittsburgh hotel and then on the 1988 presidential campaign staff for George H. W. Bush. He served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Australia and Papua New Guinea.\\"Investigative report shines new light into dark corners of a controversial Draper train station development,\\" The Salt Lake Tribune, November 13, 2019 Hughes earned an Associate degree from Utah Valley State College (now Utah Valley University) and attended briefly Brigham Young University. Career When District 51 Republican Representative John Swallow ran for Congress and left the seat open, Hughes ran in the June 25, 2002 Republican primary and won with 1,047 votes (53%) and was unopposed for the November 5, 2002 general election, winning with 7,224 votes. Hughes was unopposed in the 2004 and 2006 elections. In 2008, Hughes faced Margaret Bird in the Republican primary. Hughes was unopposed in the 2010 and 2012 elections before facing a primary challenger again in 2014. From 2015 to 2018, Hughes served as Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives. He opted not to run for re-election in 2018. In January 2020, Hughes announced his candidacy for the 2020 Utah gubernatorial election. In April 2020, Hughes named Washington County Commissioner, Victor Iverson, as his running mate. In the Republican primary, Hughes faced former governor and diplomat Jon Huntsman Jr., incumbent Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox, and former Chair of the Utah Republican Party, Thomas Wright. After placing third behind Huntsman and Cox, Hughes conceded the race before a winner was announced. =Controversy= Conflict of interest concerns were raised over Hughes' business relationship with developer Kevin Garn while Hughes was serving as the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) board chairman. In April 2011, Greg Hughes and former House Majority Leader Kevin Garn formed a company together to construct an apartment building on land that Hughes owned in downtown Salt Lake City. Several months later, UTA chose a separate company owned by Garn to develop several transit-oriented developments. Hughes was the UTA board chairman at that time, and did not disclose a business relationship with Garn. In 2018, The Salt Lake Tribune reported on a conflict-of-interest controversy as part of on ongoing federal probe into the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). Questions were raised in 2016 surrounding the company \\"Urban Chase Property Management\\", which is co-owned by Hughes, that would use surplus property owned by UTA. Newly-released documents from 2016 show that UTA believed that \\"Greg Hughes' proposed participation in this project, even if it is just as an investor, appears to be a conflict of interest.\\" Hughes had no comment due to an ongoing federal investigation, but documents indicate Hughes \\"did not know the project was related to UTA.\\" In June of 2018, a conflict-of-interest caused Greg Hughes to step down from his self-appointed position on the board of the Utah Inland Port Authority after it was discovered that he was registered with at least eight companies owning land within five miles of the inland port. Hughes said he had been unaware that his land was within the disqualification boundary.  Personal life  He and his wife, Krista, live in Draper, Utah with their three kids. Hughes is a self-employed property manager and developer, and has served on the board of the Utah Transit Authority.

Steele (January 27, 1924 ‚Äì January 19, 2009) was an American medical doctor and retired US Air Force colonel, most widely known for coining the word bionics. Biography Steele was born Jack Ellwood Steele in Lacon, Illinois. He attended Mendota Township High School (Mendota, Ill), then went on to study general engineering at the University of Illinois and the Illinois Institute of Technology. He served in the US Army from 1943 to 1946, who put him through pre-med at University of Minnesota in 1944. He received his M.D. from Northwestern University in 1950. He spent a year there as Research and Teaching Fellow in Neuro-anatomy before joining the US Air Force in 1951 where he served until retirement in 1971. He initially served as Ward Officer of Psychiatry and Neurology until he joined 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Lab in 1953. There he investigated stress effects of motions, sound and wind blast, but his main focus was on bionics, a term he coined in 1958. The term was officially used in 1960 as the title of a three-day symposium in September of that year. His work on bionics, and the USAF research on cyborgs, caught the attention of SF writer and aviation expert Martin Caidin, whose 1972 book Cyborg makes explicit reference to then-Major Jack Steele. The book formed the basis of the TV series The Six Million Dollar Man (and spinoff The Bionic Woman), which popularized, if somewhat inaccurately, the term bionics. (Steele's original meaning was the study of biological organisms to find solutions to engineering problems, a field now also known as biomimetics.) After retiring from the Air Force, Steele continued to practice medicine with a focus on psychiatry, and served as Medical Director of the Comprehensive Drug Dependency Treatment Program at the Dayton Mental Health Center, where he worked for 20 years until retirement. Steele died in Dayton, Ohio on 19 January 2009 after a protracted illness. References * The Cyborg Handbook, Routledge, New York 1995, ed.

He is best known for his inventive structures that incorporated a range of atypical building materials to provide shelter in the developing world and emergency contexts. Biography Eco-DomeSee more construction images in Wikimedia Commons sandbag shelter under construction in Djibouti, May 2012 Khalili received his philosophical and architectural education in Iran, Turkey, and the United States. In 1970 he was licensed by the State of California and practiced architecture in the U.S. and around the world. Khalili was known for his innovation into the Geltaftan Earth-and-Fire System known as Ceramic Houses and the Earthbag Construction technique called Superadobe. His designs are heavily inspired by traditional arid house designs in his homeland Iran. He was involved with Earth Architecture and Third World Development since 1975, and was a U.N. consultant for Earth Architecture. He developed his Super Adobe system in 1984, in response to a NASA call for designs for human settlements on the Moon and Mars. The project had been completely theoretical until the Persian Gulf War when refugees were sent into Iran. When this occurred Khalili partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and applied his research to emergency shelters. In 1991 he founded the California Institute of Earth Art and Architecture (Cal-Earth), where he taught his Superadobe building technique. Although Khalili's work received mixed support in his native country, arguably due to social paradigms and political unrest, he became a prominent American leader on the value of ethically based architecture, where the needs of the homeless are considered above all else. Superadobe construction Awards In 1984, Khalili received the award for ‚ÄúExcellence in Technology‚Äù from the California Council of the American Institute of Architects (CCAIA) for his innovative Ceramic House System.

Its Romanesque Revival building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1990. Architecture and history The Adams Street Shul is located on the north side of Adams Street a short way east of Watertown Street (Massachusetts Route 16), the main road through Nonantum Village. It is a single-story brick structure, three bays wide, with a pair of round-arch windows flanking the main entrance, which is also set in a round- arch opening. Above the entrance is an oculus window with a Star of David. The synagogue was built in 1912 by a Jewish congregation established in 1911. It was Newton's only synagogue until 1937, when Temple Emanuel was completed on Ward Street. It was built with significant contribution of labor by the congregation, which included skilled craftsmen. The Torah ark and bema were added in 1924, the work of a Jewish-Ukrainian craftsman, who also created the Vilna Shul ark. The interior has seen only modest alterations since its construction. The congregation has remained small but steady, with many families having multiple generations of membership.

In 1912, Gammage suffered a bout of tuberculosis that forced him to move west. Settling in Arizona, he found employment as a groundskeeper for the University of Arizona. He enrolled as a freshman there and served as a campaign manager for the Prohibition initiative.http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/tommarshallstucson/gradygammage.htm In 1916, he began his graduate studies and worked part-time for The Post. In 1918, Gammage shifted his studies from law to school administration and, in 1922, he completed a master's degree. After graduation, Gammage accepted the position of superintendent at Winslow Public Schools. During the summer, he earned extra money teaching sessions at Northern Arizona State Teachers College in Flagstaff. In 1925, Gammage was appointed vice-president of the college and he became president the following year. During his tenure, Gammage raised the standards of achievement for students and faculty, improved campus morale, and developed a sound relationship between campus and community. In 1927, the college awarded him an honorary LL.D. Gammage was a tireless promoter of the college and, in 1928, the school received official recognition as a Class A four-year teacher training institution and a new name ‚Äî Arizona State Teacher's College at Flagstaff. In 1930, ASTC was the first school in the Southwest to be granted full accreditation. As economic conditions worsened during The Great Depression, Gammage made it possible for students suffering \\"hard times\\" to pay their expenses through barter; dairy cows and potatoes underwrote room and board. In 1933, Gammage resigned the presidency at ASTC when he accepted the position of president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe (later Arizona State University), a post he held until his death in December 1959.http://library.nau.edu/speccoll/exhibits/first100/pres/gammage.html  References  External links * Biographical information from NAU * Biographical information from ASU * The Arizona State University Story * Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium * Category:1892 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Presidents of Arizona State University Category:Northern Arizona University faculty Category:Arizona State University faculty Category:People from Flagstaff, Arizona Category:People from Phoenix, Arizona Category:People from Prescott, Arkansas ","title":"Grady Gammage"},{"id":"9436505","text":"Anarky was a short-lived American comic book series published by DC Comics, as a limited series between May and August of 1997, and as an ongoing series between May and December of 1999. It was written by Alan Grant, with pencils by Norm Breyfogle, and inks by Josef Rubinstein. The comic was a spin-off title derived from the Batman franchise, and followed the adventures of Anarky, an antagonist of the Batman character. Although Anarky had originally been created to reflect the philosophy of anarchism, the primary influence on both volumes was Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. The comic was overtly political in nature, exploring a number of themes including antimilitarism, homelessness, and political corruption. Publication history =Anarky vol. 1= Following the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle was unemployed and looking for work. As a result of a request Breyfogle made to DC for employment, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at DC Comics, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, written by Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon. The four-issue limited series, Anarky, was published in May 1997. Entitled \\"Metamorphosis\\", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, an offshoot of Objectivism. During the climax of the \\"Anarky\\" storyline of Batman: Shadow of the Bat #41-42, it is implied that Anarky dies in a large explosion. In turn, the Anarky limited series resolved this event by revealing that Anarky survives, but chooses to shed the encumbrance of his double life by faking his death. Anarky works in seclusion to further his goal of achieving a utopian society, briefly hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. He has several further brushes with Batman, as well as the likes of Etrigan and Darkseid.; ; ; Grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his \\"career highlights\\". =Anarky vol. 2= With the success of the first Anarky series, Darren Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment. Grant's primary concerns centered on his belief that Anarky's role as a non- superpowered teenager was not capable of competing for reader attention when DC Comics already had a similar series in Robin. Further, while potential disagreements with editors over story elements were not among his initial concerns, he eventually found himself constantly at odds with editors and editorial assistants throughout the creation of the series. During the Anarky series, much of the character's development was influenced by the nature of Grant and Breyfogle's association. As part of the story writing process, the duo would engage in philosophical discussion carried out entirely over fax- transmissions. These long, in-depth, and occasionally heated debates influenced plot points, as well as the general direction of Anarky's character development. Scheduled for a release date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to coincide with the creation of a trade paperback, Batman: Anarky, to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, Batman: Anarky was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or \\"tone down\\" the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an earthquake in Gotham Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, \\"Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I‚Äôd written that because it didn‚Äôt make sense to me at the time and it doesn‚Äôt make sense now.\\" These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. \\"I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work.\\" Grant's doubts concerning the comic's prospects eventually proved correct. The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues, however Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in Spanish speaking countries, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region. \\"It didn‚Äôt sit too well with American readers, who prefer the soap opera and cool costume aspects of superhero comics. But I became a minor hero in many Latin countries, like Argentina and Mexico, where readers had been subjected to tyranny and fascism and knew precisely what I was writing about.\\" =Final issue controversy= Art by Norm Breyfogle. The tagline reads, \\"Your name is Anarky. One of these guys is your father. Have a nice life!\\" Despite numerous editorial impositions, the most controversial plot point was not a mandate, but was instead a suggestion by Breyfogle, intended as a means to expand Anarky's characterization: that Anarky's biological father be revealed to be the Joker. Breyfogle expressed an interest using the relationship as a source for internal conflict in the character. \\"...I figured that because Anarky represents the epitome of reason, one of the biggest crises he could face would be to discover that his father was the exact opposite: a raving lunatic!\\" Alternatively, Grant saw it as an opportunity to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise. Grant's decision to pursue the suggestion ran into conflict with Dennis O'Neil, who protested against it. According to Grant: Pressing forward, Grant wrote the Anarky series with the intention of allowing the storyline to play out over time. As the first issue narrates, Anarky begins a search for his missing parents in Anarky vol.2 #1, and comes upon evidence that the Machins are not his biological parents, that his mother is insane and that his father is a \\"madman\\". As revealed in Anarky vol.2 #8, his leads point to the possibility that his biological father is the Joker. He first meets his supposed biological mother, but finds that she is clinically unstable and unable to answer his questions. He then breaks into Arkham Asylum to confront the Joker himself, but is betrayed, as the Joker opportunistically attempts to escape from the Asylum without providing any firm answers. As the last issue of the Anarky series, this unresolved ending left open the possibility that the Joker might be Anarky's actual father, and the planned \\"rebuttal\\" was never published. Further, Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that as Dennis O'Neil has retired from DC Comics, and the final editorial decision currently belongs to Dan DiDio, it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published. As of 2010, there is yet no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject, though the DC Universe timeline chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years. As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under \\"work-for- hire\\" rules, DC Comics owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the Anarky series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined. While Grant has commented that the first volume stands among his favorite works, he did not wish to create the ongoing series. Convinced by Norm Breyfogle to continue the series, he chafed under what he felt were excessive demands made by editors for specific plot changes, such as \\"toning down\\" Anarky's philosophy and including cameos for Superman, the Haunted Tank, and the Justice League. One of the earliest of these was that Grant was \\"made to\\" remove Anarky from Gotham City. This was achieved by explaining that following an earthquake in Gotham Lonnie's parents disappeared, their house was destroyed, and he was threatened by Batman to leave the city. As one of many refugees who escaped from No Man's Land, he relocated to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Grant considered abandoning the project, but continued it for Breyfogle's sake, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment.Getting The 411: Alan Grant. 411mania.com Accessed August 14, 2004 The second volume was heavily criticized by reviewers and failed to catch on among readers, until it was announced in the seventh issue that it would be canceled due to poor sales following the eighth issue.Anarky (vol.2) #7 (November 1999) At the time of cancellation, two issues had been fully written and illustrated, but remained unpublished.These details are provided by Breyfogle in the Anarky Farewell , an article written in response to the cancellation of the series.

He later specifies Mexico and Argentina as two of these countries in Getting The 411: Alan Grant. 411mania.com Accessed August 14, 2004 =Controversy= The series ended in controversy when the final issue suggested that Anarky was the biological son of the Joker. Originally a suggestion by Norm Breyfogle, the idea was advanced by Alan Grant as an attempt to solidify Anarky's role as a part of the Batman mythos. The idea was protested against by Dennis O'Neil, who only allowed the publication of the story to take place after Grant negotiated a compromise. With the series cancellation taking place before the rebuttal could be produced, the story has been neither challenged nor confirmed for many years (as of 2008). After a period of several years in obscurity, Anarky was briefly \\"returned\\" to DC publications in 2005, when James Peatty wrote an issue of Green Arrow in which Anarky guest-starred. When interviewed about the story, Peaty noted the importance of Anarky's parentage on his interpretation of the character, alluding the final issue of the Anarky series. Although Peaty expressed a desire to continue using Anarky in other stories, he eventually became employed by Marvel Comics, and Anarky returned to a second period of obscurity. Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that with Dennis O'Neil's retirement, and with the final editorial decision now belonging to Dan DiDio, it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published. There is currently no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject. When asked if fans desired \\"change\\" in comic books, Alan Grant submitted: \\"publishers want the illusion of change, rather than change itself.\\" He then referenced the final issue of Anarky, and quoted an unnamed senior DC Comics official, who he claimed had told him, \\"'Anarky will never be the Joker's son. You can write the story, but someone else will write the sequel showing it just can't be.'\\" In an overview of the issue, \\"The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe\\" notes that the DC Universe timeline chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years. Plot synopsis =\\"Metamorphosis\\"= ;Volume 1, issues 1‚Äì4 The story describes that Lonnie Machin narrowly survived an explosion which faked his death in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #40 and 41 (July - August 1995). Several months later, he has begun a new plan to liberate the world of government. As Anarky, he attempts to create a device which will emit beams of light on frequencies which will trigger the human brain of all who see it. The people will then be \\"de- brainwashed\\" of all the social constraints which society has placed on the individual. Utilizing a makeshift teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube,The device is vaguely referred to as a \\"teleportation device\\" or inaccurately as a \\"boom tube\\" at different times during the two volumes of the series. The term \\"boom tube\\" is inaccurate as it refers to the portal opened by such devices, not the devices themselves. Further, the device is never described as being akin to a Mother Box, another device in the DC universe capable of generating a boom tube. he begins a quest to capture the power sources the device will need: the madness of Etrigan, the evil of Darkseid, and the goodness of Batman. During the confrontation between Anarky and Batman, the device is damaged. Thus, when Machin activates it, it only affects himself. The vision that follows reveals what may have happened if he had succeeded, with nightmarish consequences. The conclusion of the story is that if society is to change, individuals must accept that change voluntarily. When Batman turns off the machine, Anarky awakens and promptly escapes, vowing to continue his mission, \\"until they all learn to choose for themselves.\\" =\\"Aberration!\\"= Art by Norm Breyfogle. The illustration features multiple figures and plot elements which appear during the \\"Aberration!\\" story arch. ;Volume 2, issues 1‚Äì3 Taking place during the No Man's Land story arc, sixteen-year-old Lonnie Machin, aka Anarky, is chased from the ruins of Gotham City by Batman, who refuses to face Anarky in a turf war over the city. With financial independence and technical genius, Anarky invents his new ally, MAX, an artificially intelligent computer, and uses his teleportation device and wealth to reestablish a secret base below the Washington Monument. He then begins a war against supervillains and the United States Government, while simultaneously searching for his parents, who disappeared in the aftermath of the Cataclysm story arc. During research, Anarky mathematically predicts the eventual appearance of an \\"Aberration,\\" an anomaly of physics that will destroy the planet, and steals a Green Lantern power ring to combat it. This draws the attention of Kyle Rayner, who attempts to regain the ring before teaming up with Anarky against the Aberration. Near the end, Anarky is nearly seduced by the power of the ring and tempted to keep it, but comes to the conclusion that \\"power corrupts\\" and opts to return it, only for the ring to be destroyed during the battle. As an epiloque, MAX uncovers evidence that the Machins adopted Lonnie as an infant, and that his real father is \\"a madman.\\" The mystery of the alleged father's identity becomes a recurring subplot of the series until the final issue. =\\"War and Peace\\"= ;Volume 2, issues 4‚Äì6 Anarky stumbles upon a black market transaction between a US senator and anonymous henchmen, and disrupts their meeting. He discovers that the senator was selling codes that revealed coordinates of bio-warfare factories in Iraq, and later that Ra's al Ghul was the buyer. The international terrorist's goal is to launch missiles against the factories from Israel, releasing clouds of deadly bacteria and sparking a war in the Middle East, the result of which would be a death toll in the millions. Ra's al Ghul eventually obtains the codes and launches his missiles. However, Anarky supplies him with the incorrect codes and the missiles land harmlessly over the desert. He then uses the Internet to alert the world to the plot, which results in the missile sites being discovered and destroyed by US warplanes. As an epilogue to the story, a secret meeting is held by key members of the federal government in the White House. The threat Anarky represents to the men attending is discussed, and it is decided that Mr. Staines, a mysterious figure employed by the federal government, would be charged with the task of neutralizing him. Mr. Staines suggests the use of Capital Eagle, a government employed superhuman, to defeat Anarky. =\\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\"= ;Volume 2, issue 7 A tie-in to the Day of Judgment crossover event, Anarky encounters The Haunted Tank and teams up with its crew to defeat an army of zombies rising from Arlington National Cemetery. Anarky also encounters various Founding Fathers in the process. The story carries a strong anti-war message, and ends when Anarky, demoralized by the sight of pointless fighting among men from every war in US history, refuses to fight and abandons the battlefield. =\\"The Sins of the Father\\"= ;Volume 2, issue 8 Taking place after the No Man's Land story arc, Lonnie Machin decides to finally confront his supposed biological parents to uncover the truth of his lineage. He first meets with his alleged biological mother, Greta Mitchell, but finds that she is mentally unbalanced, due to the side effects of Joker venom she was exposed to years earlier. In a flashback, she tells the story of how she became pregnant by the Joker, and that due to her condition she was deemed unfit for parental responsibility and that her child was taken away from her. However, Lonnie is unable to get any more information from her. As a final recourse, Anarky breaks into Arkham Asylum using his teleporter and confronts his alleged father, now revealed to be the Joker. Meanwhile, the Joker is in the midst of a prison break with other inmates, and takes advantage of the situation to steal the teleporter, and then forces Anarky to participate. Unarmed, Anarky plays along until he manages to regain the teleporter to escape, without the Joker having given him any clear answers either. Although the story presents no evidence, Anarky asserts that he personally believes the Joker is his father, and fears that someday he may become insane as well. Characters *Anarky (Lonnie Machin): a teenage polymath, and anarchist vigilante named Lonnie Machin. Anarky uses his intelligence and wealth to wage a war against supervillains and government. He is the main character of both series, and was originally featured as an antagonist in various Batman comics. He is stated to be fifteen-years-old during the events of the first volume, and sixteen-years- old during the second. Originally produced as a limited series, the first volume of Anarky utilized previously established characters to guest star in each issue. *Legs: a homeless Vietnam veteran, and resident of the streets of Gotham City. Legs is ironically named for his missing limbs, which he lost due to an anti-personnel mine explosion in the Vietnam War. He is loyal to Lonnie Machin, and supports his activity as Anarky. Anarky hires him and other homeless men to act as spies on Batman. *Etrigan the Demon (Jason Blood): a demon bound to the human Jason Blood.

Batman investigates Anarky's activity, and eventually confronts the boy at a high-rise tower, foiling Anarky's plot to \\"save the world\\". New characters were introduced in the second volume with the intention that they would become regular cast members and receive more character development in future issues. However, due to the short run of the series, most of the original characters appeared in a limited number of scenes, with MAX being the only character to appear in every issue. Three characters ‚Äì Roach, Mr. Stains, and Capital Eagle ‚Äì were intended to appear in two unpublished issues.The information regarding the unpublished issues of Anarky can be seen in illustrations created by Norm Breyfogle, provided in the Anarky Gallery section of his website.

He first appears in Anarky vol.2 #6, October 1999. Mr. Staines was later featured in a Batman one-shot, Batman: Dreamland, by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle. The story presents Mr. Stains as an enigmatic scientist spearheading a top secret, black budget, mind control program in \\"Dreamland\\" (aka Area 51). Staines is represented as an idealist who believes that society can be rid of war, crime, and chaos if the minds of individuals are controlled by authority figures.Batman: Dreamland (w) Grant, Alan (co writer) Breyfogle, Norm.

It is unique as the only mainstream comic book ever influenced by this philosophy.*Holy Penis Collapsor Batman! DC Publishes The First Zonpower Comic Book!?!?! gocomics.com. Retrieved February 18, 1998. A recurring theme in the first volume included four scenes, at one page per issue, in which Anarky expounded philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly for the reader, including explaining a bicameralism,Anarky (vol.1) #1 (May 1997) the difference between Plato and Aristotle,Anarky (vol.1) #2 (June 1997) the concept of economic \\"parasites,\\"Anarky (vol.1) #3 (July 1997) and how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to advance.Anarky (vol.1) #4 (August 1997) In an interview, Alan Grant explained that in the original script, these monologues were titled \\"The History of Consciousness part 1 through 4\\", and that Norm Breyfogle designed the illustrations so that a single quarter of a Circle-A would act as a backdrop to each, which when placed together created a complete poster image. This theme was not utilized in the second volume, but story narration continued to allude to these concepts. Bicameralism and philosophy of the mind remained a topic of concern to Grant while writing the series, which Grant hoped could act as a vehicle for his thoughts on the origin of consciousness. The comparison between Plato and Aristotle had been used in two earlier stories which featured Anarky, although at the time the character was described as an anarchist.Anarky enters into monologues in which he describes the difference between Plato's concept of guardianship vs. that of Aristotle's concept of self-responsibility in Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual #2 (1994), The Tyrant, and The Batman Adventures #31, The People's Court. (April 1995) Several of the issues contained strong anti-war messages, including issue #6. Near the conclusion of the War and Peace storyline, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the internet to hold an instant messaging session with the public in which he debates the need for war, arguing that money and time used on military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global overpopulation crisis.Anarky (vol.2) #6 (October 1999) The series also introduced atheist leanings into the character's portrayal, coinciding with Grant's Neo-Tech philosophy.Anarky vol.1 #1 (May 1997): Metamorphosis Part 1 Political messages were also occasionally displayed in the backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness.Anarky vol.1 #3 (July 1997): Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, \\"(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan‚Äôs stories. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I was being particularly subversive, although I was a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.Norm Breyfogle @ Adelaide Comics and Books.

He then attended law school and passed the New York bar in 1837. At the time, American literature was generally regarded as necessarily inferior to the British, and American authors were encouraged to follow English models closely. This at least was the view espoused by the literary elite of New York, who tended to orbit the influential and conservative editor of the Knickerbocker Magazine, Lewis Gaylord Clark. Mathews vehemently disagreed, and called for a new literary style that would express a distinctly American identity, although this style was not to be a populist or demotic one. Their politics was limited to a call for international copyright law, to curb the wholesale copyright infringement of American literature in England. Stylistically, Mathews favored an approach that emphasized the cosmopolitan sweep and diversity of American society, bolder and more philosophical than the sort of cozy humor associated with the Knickerbocker Magazine (although Mathews did not refuse to appear in its pages), but not as abstruse and Germanic as the Transcendentalist literature of Boston. Mathews‚Äô panacea was the emulation of Rabelais, whose Gargantua and Pantagruel, he believed, managed to advance philosophical penetration without etherializing its subject matter. For two years (1840‚Äì1842), Mathews and Duyckinck wrote for and co-edited Young America's uneven journal, Arcturus, publishing also Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell. Mathews coined the name for the Young America movement in an 1845 speech. As he described the movement, \\"Here, in New York, is the seat and strong-hold of this young power: but, all over the land, day by day, new men are emerging into activity, who partake of these desires, who scorn and espise the past pettiness of the country, and who are ready to sustain any movement toward a better and nobler condition\\".Widmer, Edward L. Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York City. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 57. Throughout the period of his principle literary activity, the 1840s and 1850s, Mathews contributed to and/or helped to edit all manner of American periodicals, including the New-Yorker, the Comic World, the New York Dramatic Mirror, the American Monthly Magazine, the New York Review, the New York Reveille, and a would-be rival to the Knickerbocker Magazine, the rapidly moribund Yankee Doodle. In 1853, he published A Pen-and-Ink Panorama of New York City, a collection of essays, character sketches, and sketches on the scenery of New York.Callow, James T. Kindred Spirits: Knickerbocker Writers and American Artists, 1807‚Äì1855. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1967: 149. Although he wrote several satirical plays, his most successful play was Witchcraft, or the Martyrs of Salem (1846), which was more serious in tone and written in blank verse. Cornelius Mathews died in New York City in 1889. Critical response and influence Reviewing Mathews's Wakondah in Graham's Magazine Edgar Allan Poe wrote that it had \\"no merit whatever; while its faults... are of that rampant class which if any schoolboy could be found so uninformed as to commit them, any schoolboy should remorselessly be flogged for committing.\\"Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never- ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991: 164 . Of Mathews's novel Puffer Hopkins, Poe called it \\"one of the most trashy novels that ever emanated from an American press\\".Duberman, Martin. James Russell Lowell. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 49. Mathews was such a strong proponent of copyright law, he was considered a joke by some in the literary scene.Bayless, Joy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943. p. 122 Critic and anthologist Rufus Wilmot Griswold included Mathews in his Prose Writers of America (1847) but criticized his vehement push for nationalist literature. \\"Mr. Mathews\\", Griswold said, \\"wrote very good English and very good sense until he was infected with the disease of building up a national literature.\\"Bayless, Joy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943. p. 123 Charles Frederick Briggs satirized Mathews in the novel Trippings of Tom Pepper, depicting him as a lawyer named Mr. Ferocious who frequently interrupts others to advocate literature which is \\"fresh, home-born\\" and free of foreign influence.Wallach, Glenn. Obedient Sons: The Discourse of Youth and Generations in American Culture, 1630-1860. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1997: 129. Margaret Fuller, however, supported his advocacy for a national literatureVon Mehren, Joan. Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994: 223. and said that Mathew's play Witchcraft was an example of \\"a true, genuine, invincible Americanism.\\"Miller, Perry. The Raven and the Whale: The War of Words and Wits in the Era of Poe and Melville. New York: Harvest Book, 1956: 170. Elizabeth Barrett Browning prefaced her poem \\"A Rhapsody Of Life's Progress\\" with a quote, \\"Fill all the stops of life with tuneful breath.\\", and note on Mathews, \\"‚Ä¶ an American poet‚Äîas remarkable, in thought and manner, for a vital sinewy vigour, as the right arm of Pathfinder.\\"\\"A Rhapsody Of Life's Progress\\" The Poems Of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume 1. 1853. litscape.com American literary historian Perry Miller, writing in The Raven and the Whale, suggested that Herman Melville was influenced by Mathew's Behemoth (1839) when writing Moby-Dick.Miller, Perry.

The trade led to the development of ancient towns, forts and caravanserai en route, apart from agricultural development. Four towns in the Negev Desert, which flourished during the period from 300 BC to 200 AD, are linked directly with the Mediterranean terminus of both the Incense Road and spice trade routes: Avdat, Haluza, Mamshit, and Shivta. As a group, these desert cities demonstrate the lucrative trade in frankincense and myrrh that took place from Yemen in south Arabia to the port of Gaza on the Mediterranean. At its height, the route included cities, Qanat irrigation systems, fortresses, and caravanserai. Vestiges of these works are still visible, and demonstrate the use of the desert for commerce and agriculture. Location The Incense Route ‚Äì Desert Cities in the Negev site comprises the Negev, southern Israel, which connected Arabia to the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic-Roman period. During the period from 300 BC to 200 AD, four towns which prospered in the Negev Desert were Avdat, Haluza, Mamshit, and Shivta. These were linked directly with the Mediterranean terminus of both the Incense Road and spice trade routes. During the peak period of prosperity the route included cities, Qanat irrigation systems, fortresses, and caravanserai History The east‚Äìwest \\"incense route\\", which operated from 400 BC to 200 AD, brought economic progress to the Nabataeans; the trade diminished when Romans occupied Petra which was then Jordan's capital of the Nabataean Empire. The Nabataeans had occupied this territory in the 6th century BC following the Edomites deserting this area and occupying the Judaean plains. This resulted in transformation of Nabataeans from their semi-nomadic living style to the Hellenistic culture where organized government machinery functioned. They perpetuated slave trade to the benefit of the Ptolemics even though they established neutral diplomatic and military relations with other countries. The sites are managed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Israel Antiquities Authority; the latter authority has the task of conservation and excavation of the listed structures. The sites were mostly deserted from the 7th century AD and remained fairly well preserved. =World heritage status= The end of the incense route in the Negev Region of Israel, which included towns, forts, caravanserai and the irrigation system in desertic areas with links to the Mediterranean, has been inscribed as a cultural heritage site of the UNESCO's World Heritage List under Criteria (iii) as confirmation of the economic, social and cultural importance of frankincense to the Hellenistic-Roman world, and Criteria (v) for development along the route in severe desert conditions. The site was inscribed on 15 July 2005 in the meeting of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO. Features Avdat Ruins in Avdat Ruins in Mamshit Ruins of Shivta Ruins of church at Shivta The network of the Incense Route consisted of trade routes that encompassed towns and cities in a stretch of more than . The site covers an area of with an additional buffer zone of . The Mediterranean was the first link on this route in the Negev Desert to the southern part of Israel in a route of length, with Moa on the eastern border and with Jordan to Haluza on the northwestern side. The entire route was benefited by the trade and villages prospered with innovative irrigation systems. Agricultural development was distinctly visible in the four villages of Haluza, Mamshit, Avdat and Shivta, and in the four fortresses; and the caravanserai of Moa and Saharonim facilitating the stay of the traders. The site nominated on the World Heritage List covers the land features of the area and a route length of from Petra to Gaza covering Avdat and Moa towns, further north of Haluza town; to the west of the route, the Shivta town; Mamshit town between Petra and Damascus. The Nabateans, settlers in the area, developed sophisticated irrigation practices and they were also pastorals dependent on livestock development of sheep, cattle, and goats. They domesticated camels which they used extensively as caravans on the incense route. =Avdat= The Avdat is within an area of perched above the plains in the western part of the Ramon-Nafkha highlands. It is surrounded by a wall built of limestone, and housed within it are the remnants of a Nabatean temple, a fort, a main street, two churches and a caravanserai. Also visible are short walls and arched roofs. =Haluza= The Haluza town is in the northern extremity of the nominated site and is a desert with sand dunes which has buried most of the town. Recent excavations have unearthed remnants of two churches, a tower, a wine press, a theater, and a road. =Mamshit= The Mamshit town is at the western extreme end of the designated site and has been subject to extensive archaeological excavations. The excavations have revealed presence of a town wall, caravanserai, big private residences, a market road, and bathhouses. Some of the structures have been refurbished. The finds include frescoes and mosaics. =Shivta= The Shivta town is in the central Negev and has not been fully excavated. The finds unearthed so far have revealed remnants of double and triple storied houses, churches with apses, roads, a residence of the governor, a town square, a farm, wine presses, and many more. The building material used in construction of the buildings is limestone. There is no compound wall enclosing the village. =Fortresses= The fortresses in the area are: The Moa Fort and Caravanserai at the east end of the nominated site are close to the Jordanian border, and are built of dressed limestone. The fort overlooks the caravanserai located in the plains. The surviving fort walls are only of height, and of height in the case of caravanserai. Ruins of a well laid out water system sourced from underground springs and feeding the bathhouse through a canal to the caravanserai also exist at the site. Other finds include agricultural tools from the fort. The Kasra Fort which lies to the west of Moa on a hill feature above the Kasra Wadi (river) has evidence of fossil limestone walls to a height of . The Nekarot Fort is also to the west of the site and has ruined parts of a tower in square shape next to a courtyard yard. The Makhmal Fort, square in shape, is in ruins with high walls built of limestone blocks. Graffon Fortress, similar in design to Makhmal fortress, is also in ruins with only meter high walls visible. =Caravanserai= There is a large caravanserai towards the west of the site. Soft clay stones and burnt clay bricks have been used in its construction. Apart from the living rooms, it has chambers for cooking, washing and workplaces. It is also in ruins with only about high walls. Large area of agricultural land formed in terraces surround this caravanserai. =Agriculture= Agriculture practiced by the Nabateans in the arid desert conditions where the annual precipitation is of the order , is through a well developed irrigation system consisting of hundreds of small dams, channels, cisterns, and reservoirs which collect flood water. The agricultural fields have been noted on the river banks and hill slopes in Avdat and central Negev where a very large number of water collection cairns built in stone are present. =Other finds= Twenty-two milestones have been found in the Nafha Highlands and the Ramon Makhtesh areas between the Makhmal Fort and the Saharonim Fort. They are cylindrical in shape with square bases made of stone. Field stones are also seen set in different patterns at road crossings, or as religious sites. One stretch of such arranged stones is in length. Road sections are also discerned in several stretches of the route.

He is most notable for coaching both the Perth Wildcats and the Cairns Taipans in the Australian National Basketball League. Black has three children, sons Stephen (former NBL player) and Andrew, and daughter Marissa. Playing career Black started his NBL playing career in the league's inaugural year, 1979, playing for the Nunawading Spectres. In 1981, he was a member of the Nunawading side that lost to Launcestion Casino City in the Grand Final that season. After seven seasons with the Spectres, Black made the move west in 1986 to play for the Perth Wildcats. In 1987, Black was once again a member of a losing Grand Final side when the Wildcats were defeated by the Brisbane Bullets. After only one more season with the Wildcats, Black retired from playing in 1988. Coaching career Black started his NBL coaching career by replacing then Wildcats head coach Cal Bruton in 1989. His rookie coaching season saw him lead the Wildcats to third on the NBL ladder (with 16 wins and 8 losses) and through to the semi-finals. In 1990 he was once again named the Wildcats head coach, but after only two games was controversially fired by the club to be replaced by Cal Bruton for the remainder of the season. That season saw the Wildcats win their very first championship with the team Black had recruited. In 1993, Black became the head coach for the Illawarra Hawks and led the club into the quarter finals each year until he left the club at the end of the 1995 season. During his time with the Hawks, Black was named the NBL's Coach of the Year in both 1993 and 1995. Black move to Sydney in 1996 to begin coaching the Sydney Kings. However, his tenure with the Kings was not as successful as his time with the Hawks and left the club after the 1997 season. In 1998, Black returned to the Perth Wildcats as head coach, this time replacing Adrian Hurley. The following season Black's son, Stephen, began his NBL career with the Wildcats, appearing in a minor role to replace the injured Ricky Grace. He would eventually become a full member of the squad in 1999. This time around, Alan Black's tenure at the Wildcats lasted considerably longer than his first, and also resulted in his first NBL championship in 1999/2000. Black coached the Wildcats for six straight seasons before history seemed to repeat itself. After being defeated by the Sydney Kings in the 2002/2003 grand final series, Black was once again fired by the club which was somewhat surprising, especially to the coach that had led them to their 7th grand final appearance. Black was replaced by his assistant coach Mike Ellis. In response to his fathers sacking, son Stephen also departed the club. Black returned to the NBL as a head coach in 2005, this time for the Cairns Taipans. In his first season with the Taipans, he coached the team to their highest finish on the NBL ladder (5th) and to their first semi-final appearance. After the club went into receivership at the end of 2008, Black agreed to a pay reduction of 50% to continue to aid the floundering NBL club. Despite this he was still sacked from the team just prior to the end of the season. In 2015, Black was appointed head coach of the Willetton Tigers for the 2015 MSBL season, joining his son Andrew, a player at the club.SBL season preview ‚Äì Willetton Tigers Midway through the 2016 season, Black resigned from the role to take up a consulting position in Malaysia.Alan Black resigns from Tigers Olympic career During the 1990s and the early 2000s, Black served as an assistant coach for the Australian Boomers, including during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the 1998 FIBA World Championship and the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

An agricultural chemist, he was responsible for securing Penn State's designation in 1863 as a land-grant institution under the Morrill Land Grant Act. He was buried in Union Cemetery in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, along with his wife, Rebecca Valentine Pugh.  Early life  Evan Pugh was born to Lewis and Mary (n√©e Hutton) Pugh on February 29, 1828 near Oxford in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth of six children: Rebecca, who died soon after birth (1823), Susan (1824-1913), Elizabeth (1826-1847), Enoch (1830-1854), and John (1832-1834). The family traced their lineage back to Ellis Pugh, a Quaker Welsh settler in William Penn's colony. They lived on 56 acres of land, given to Lewis by his father Jesse, on family property in a stone farmhouse with a barn and blacksmith/wheelwright shop. Shortly after Evan's birth, Lewis was blinded and burned in an accident at the forge. He died in 1840, and his widow sent Evan and Elizabeth to live with their grandfather and three aunts on a neighboring farm.  Education  Pugh was tutored by his aunts in algebra, geometry, geography, history, Latin, and stenography. From 1844 to 1846 he served as a blacksmith's apprentice, but his extensive tutoring and his dislike of his \\"master\\" convinced him to pursue higher education. His family agreed and he enrolled at Whitestown Seminary, a manual labor school near Utica, New York. After attending the seminary for a year he returned home to help with the farm and opened the Jordan Bank Academy. Pugh taught classes, including botany, analytical chemistry, geology and mineralogy, on the second floor of the blacksmith shop, and in his personal time conducted chemistry experiments and contributed to farm journals and county newspapers.  European years  After his mother remarried and his brother, Enoch, left for work in Ohio, Pugh decided to sell the family farm to an uncle and use the money earned ($2800) and his savings to travel to Europe. Pugh \\"determined that he could participate in the field of education if he could advance his own studies,\\" and German universities at the time were leaders in the development of chemistry, particularly in the agricultural fields. He enrolled at the University of Leipzig and studied under Otto Erdmann with a concentration on the chemistry of plant nutrition in 1853. In 1855, he enrolled at University of G√∂ttingen for the spring term and studied advanced analytical, organic, and agricultural chemistry under the tutelage of Fiedrich W√∂hler. He passed his Ph.D. examinations in 1856 and wrote his dissertation Miscellaneous Chemical Analyses on particular meteoric ores found in Mexico. In order to further study the effect of atmospheric gases on plant growth, Pugh traveled to Heidelberg University to study under Robert Bunsen. However, the lab was overcrowded and he disliked the politics and repressive nature of the university town. He left to vacation in the Jura Mountains, hiking from Switzerland into France. After arriving in Paris, he became interested in the direct assimilation of free nitrogen in the air by plants due to a controversy between two French scientists. This spurred Pugh to begin his own project in 1857 at the Rothamsted laboratory near London. This research later became Pugh's report On the Sources of Nitrogen of Vegetation, etc.. The report was widely lauded and Pugh was elected a Fellow of the London Chemical Society after presenting the report to the Royal Society in early 1859. Pugh kept a travel journal and wrote detailed letters home to family and Chester County newspapers throughout his travels in Europe. He also wrote detailed journals of his experiments and class notes. These manuscripts, including modern typescripts of the accounts, are currently housed along with his papers at the Pennsylvania State University Libraries in the Special Collections Library.  Farmers' High School  While Pugh was studying at the Rothamsted laboratory, he communicated with Dr. Alfred L. Elwyn of Chester County, a founder of the Farmers' High School in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Elwyn suggested that he apply for the position and request that the Board allow him a leave of absence to finish his studies in England. In February 1859, Trustee Judge Frederick Watts contacted Pugh and offered him the position of president at the Farmers' High School, as well as a stipend for purchasing laboratory equipment to bring back from Europe. Pugh's appointment officially began in February 1860 during the school's second year, however he assumed most duties as president in October 1859. Despite the numerous challenges faced by a fledgling college, especially with the Civil War disrupting its formative years, Pugh managed to establish Farmers' High School as a prominent leader in agricultural education and research. His standard duties as president included teaching, advising the 69 enrolled students, acting as disciplinarian, answering letters from parents, ordering books, lobbying in Harrisburg for funding, writing public addresses to garner support, pacifying creditors, and calling meetings of the Trustees. At the end of 1861, 11 students were awarded the first American agricultural college degrees in the Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture after graduating under the direction of Pugh and four other supervising teachers. Not long after, in 1862, Pugh began a graduate program in agricultural chemistry and awarded the first Master of Scientific Agriculture only a year later.  Personal life and death  During his visits to discuss mineral composition of the Nittany Valley with notable Bellefonte ironworks master Abram Valentine, Pugh met Abram's daughter. Rebecca and Pugh met frequently to talk about books, German language, and current news, and by early 1863 the two were engaged. In preparation for their marriage, he began designing, hauling stone, and building a house that would later become the president's residence. The wedding, however, was delayed when both were injured in a carriage accident in June 1863 while returning from visiting William Shortlidge near Bellefonte. Pugh broke his arm and spent the summer and fall in local Philadelphia hospitals having treatments for improper setting of the limb. This injury, along with enormous stress due to General Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania, the already enormous academic and administrative workload for the School, and continuing construction of his house contributed to a weakened immune system unable to fend off an attack of typhoid fever. Pugh collapsed at his desk while penning a statement for Legislature and died a week later on April 29, 1864. Rebecca never remarried, and only visited campus twice after his death: once to present the first graduating class at an alumni reunion with his portrait, and the second time to attend a semi-centennial celebration of Penn State's founding. She died in 1921 and left all of Evan's books, correspondence, and memorabilia to Penn State.

Containing two different cations, Fe2+ and NH4+, it is classified as a double salt of ferrous sulfate and ammonium sulfate. It is a common laboratory reagent because it is readily crystallized, and crystals resist oxidation by air. Like the other ferrous sulfate salts, ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolves in water to give the aquo complex [Fe(H2O)6]2+, which has octahedral molecular geometry. Its mineral form is mohrite. Structure This compound is a member of a group of double sulfates called Sch√∂nites or Tutton's salts. Tutton's salts form monoclinic crystals and have formula M2N(SO4)2.6H2O (M = various monocations). With regards to the bonding, crystals consist of octahedra [Fe(H2O)6]2+ centers, which are hydrogen bonded to sulfate and ammonium. Structure of ferrous ammonium sulfate with hydrogen bonding network highlighted (N is violet, O is red; S is orange, Fe = large red). Mohr's salt is named after the German chemist Karl Friedrich Mohr, who made many important advances in the methodology of titration in the 19th century.  Applications  In analytical chemistry, this salt is the preferred source of ferrous ions as the solid has a long shelf life, being resistant to oxidation. This stability extends somewhat to solutions reflecting the effect of pH on the ferrous/ferric redox couple. This oxidation occurs more readily at high pH. The ammonium ions make solutions of Mohr's salt slightly acidic, which slows this oxidation process. Sulfuric acid is commonly added to solutions to reduce oxidation to ferric iron. It is used in the Fricke's dosemeter to measure high doses of gamma rays.  Preparation  Mohr's salt is prepared by dissolving an equimolar mixture of hydrated ferrous sulfate and ammonium sulfate in water containing a little sulfuric acid, and then subjecting the resulting solution to crystallization. Ferrous ammonium sulfate forms light green crystals. This salt when heated ionises to give all cations and anions present in it. Contaminants Common impurities include magnesium, nickel, manganese , lead, and zinc, many of which form isomorphous salts.

Slottsbacken in Stockholm during the 1780s. From right to left: Stockholm Palace, Storkyrkan, Bollhuset Theatre and the Tessin Palace. Drawing, Martin Rudolf Heland. Slottsbacken (, \\"Castle Slope\\") is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. It stretches east from the Stockholm Cathedral and the Royal Palace down to the street Skeppsbron which passes along the eastern waterfront of the old town. In the western end, the alley K√§llargr√§nd leads south to the square Stortorget, while Storkyrkobrinken extends Slottsbacken west beyond the cathedral and H√∂gvaktsterrassen, down to the square Riddarhustorget. On the southern side of Slottsbacken, three alleys connect to the interior throng of the old town: On either side of the Tessin Palace are Finska Kyrkogr√§nd and Bollhusgr√§nd, while √ñsterl√•nggatan begins in the low-lying eastern part of the slope.  History  Slottbacken, November 2008. The street, named after the vicinity to the Royal Palace, first appears in historical records during the second half of the 15th century (1476, stalbakkan, \\"Stable Slope\\"; 1478, Slotz bakkan), and from early on the name designated not only the slope down to the waterfront, but also the open space above it. The present palace, designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and built in 1697-1760, was preceded by the Medieval castle Tre kronor (\\"Three Crowns\\") which was continuously rebuilt during it existence and was finally destroyed by fire in 1697. South of this older building was in medieval times a slope consisting of sand and gravel, deliberately left unbuilt for defensive purposes. Probably wider than the present slope, it stretched further south to the royal stables, the kitchen gardens, and the butchers stalls on the opposite side. In 1520, the burghers of the city were requested to relocate their stables and piggeries from the \\"Stable Slope\\" (Stallbacken) to the hills surrounding the city. New defensive walls were built around the royal palace during the 16th century on the expense of the open area surrounding it, defensive constructions outdated in the early 17th century. By the end of the 17th century, the slope had been transformed into an extremely narrow street squeezed between the wide moat of the palace and the variegated structures lined-up on the southern side. Parts of the five metres deep moat was used as a theatre and furnished with a superstructure. As the new palace was being built, the slope was redesigned to become the palace's grand-style Baroque antechamber, and the structures and gardens on the southern side were consequently replaced by more prestigious buildings in stone. While the exterior of the Palace was more or less completed in the 1750s, the work on the slope, the palace's main approach, was still proceeding by the end of that century.  Notable buildings and structures  = Royal Palace = South fa√ßade of the Royal Palace. Statue of Olaus Petri at the back of the Cathedral. The Tessin palace. Though the four fa√ßades of the Royal Palace are all built in brick and bound by a unitary programme, they are all given distinctive designs in accordance to their various functions. The southern fa√ßade, representing the Nation and concealing the Royal Chapel and the Rikssal (\\"National Hall\\", the royal throne room), is facing the palace's main approach and is consequently the most pompous of the four. It is dominated by a Roman triumphal arch composition dressed in limestone and furnished with six war trophies, four abduction scenes by Bouchardon, and 16 reliefs displaying mythological scenes. The balustrade over the central part was originally intended to be furnished with a series of sculptures. While the tall central portion, 115 metres wide, is flanked by a 48 metres long eastern wing, the corresponding western wing is limited to a mere 11 metres, as the original plans of the architect to demolish the Medieval cathedral were ignored. The statues in the eight niches, dating from 1899‚Äì1902, depict prominent Swedes from the late 17th century: Dahlbergh, M. Stenbock, Stiernhielm, Polhem, Tessin, Adelcrantz, Linnaeus and von Dalin. = Stockholm Cathedral = The five sections of the eastern fa√ßade of the Stockholm Cathedral reflects the three original, medieval nave and aisles and the flanking two aisles. The marble statue of Olaus Petri (1493‚Äì1552), dating from 1897 and carved by Theodore Lundberg, celebrates the reformer who, inspired by studies in Germany paid by King Gustav Vasa, translated the Bible to Swedish and had a crucial role in the development of the Swedish language. He was the head of the church 1543‚Äì1552 and is buried in it. In the cobbled pavement between the cathedral and the palace are two markings showing the location of the south-west bastion of the medieval palace and the eastern sanctuary of the medieval church destroyed by King Gustav Vasa to give the cannons of the palace more aiming space. = The Royal Household = Built in 1910 to the design of Erik Josephson (1864‚Äì1929), the tall building on number 2 was much criticized as it replaced a lower building, the concave fa√ßade of which made the space in front of the palace wider and more prominent, and the 'tenement Baroque' (hyreshusbarock) it represented was regarded as objectionable for the royal setting. The building is, however, occupied by the Royal Household (Hovstaterna). = Tessin Palace = In respect to the vicinity to the royal palace and as a consequence of the irregularly shaped lot, the relatively discreet three-story fa√ßade of the private palace of Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, unveils very little of the elaborated Baroque garden in the interior court. The limestone portal by Ferdinand Foucquet, one of the most prominent monumental sculptors of the Swedish Baroque era, gives an inviting hint of the richly decorated interior. The fa√ßade was originally flanked by two walls perpendicular to the fa√ßade. The building is today the residence of the county governor of Stockholm. = Finnish Church = Finnish Church Obelisk Statue of Gustav III. The Royal Coin Cabinet. Finland was a part of Sweden until 1809, and the national parish of the Finnish Church was established in Stockholm in 1533, at the time accommodated in the old abbey of the Blackfriars. A building constructed on the present site 1648-1653, originally intended for ball games, and thus called Lilla bollhuset (\\"Small Ball House\\"), but mostly used as a theatre, was taken over by the Finnish parish in 1725 from when the irregularly shaped building stems. In the interior, the organ loft still resembles the gallery of the old Boll House. As the church never had an accompanying graveyard, the Church of Catherine on S√∂dermalm was of great importance to the Finnish parish until the 19th century. = The obelisk = The 22 metres tall granite obelisk from 1800, is the design of architect Jean Louis Desprez. Commissioned by King Gustav III and erected by the inventor and colonel-mecanicus Jonas Lidstr√∂mer, it was a product of the kings gratitude to the burghers of Stockholm who guarded the city while the king was at war with Russia in 1788-1790. Inspired by Egyptian obelisks, it tapers vertically to end in a pyramid-like shape, but is, in contrast, made of several stones. = Statue of Gustav III = The bronze statue of Gustav III on its tall porphyry base standing by the quay, is from 1808 and designed by Johan Tobias Sergel and erected by his friend, the inventor and colonel-mecanicus Jonas Lidstr√∂mer, who also designed the postament with the functional stairs around the statue, and thus matching the surrounding quays, for which he was responsible. Inspired by Apollo Belvedere and commissioned by the king himself, it depicts the monarch dressed in a naval uniform and a mantle, handing over an olive twig to the Swedish people, as he is heroically landing on the quay following the Russian war 1788-1790. = Royal Armoury = The relatively discreet entrance to the Royal Armoury located under the eastern wing of the palace, hides the award-winning museum created in 1971-1978 showing royal costumes, crowns, carriages, and weapons displayed under the cellar vaults of the palace. = Royal Coin Cabinet = The Royal Coin Cabinet is an institution with a national responsibility for the conservation and the historical studies of coins, medals, and finance in general. Through exposition the institution offers insights in the economical history of the world, by lending objects from its collection to researchers and expositions all over the world it helps developing the knowledge within its scope, and by maintaining a national register of coin hoards it is of great importance to scholars in Sweden. Over the portal is a piece of art by Elisabeth Ekstrand from 1996 called Vattenporfyrlek (\\"Water Porphyry Game\\") made of porphyry and marble.

In addition to this series, she also wrote the Gail Gardner series, The Magic Maker series, Palace Wagon Family, Jemima, Daughter of Daniel Boone, as well as several other books. Biography  Margaret Sutton was born Rachel Beebe, in Odin, Pennsylvania on January 22, 1903. Her parents were Victor L. Beebe, a historian, musician, and carpenter, and Estella Andrews Beebe. She grew up in Coudersport, near the New York State border. Sutton found a love of storytelling from her mother at an early age. Sutton also loved literature and history, which she probably inherited from her father, who wrote \\"The History of Potter County.\\" She attended Rochester Business Institute in New York to become a stenographer. When she graduated, she worked as a secretary and later as a printer. Later, she taught creative writing to adults and many of her students became published authors. In 1924, she married William Henry Sutton. They had five children together. It wasn't until after she married him, that her writing career began. It started when she wrote stories for William's daughter. Her stories were published in \\"Picture World,\\" a magazine for children, under the name Rachel B. Sutton. She also wrote book reviews. In 1932, she published her first series book, The Vanishing Shadow, about a girl named Judy Bolton who solves mysteries. The novel was published under a pen name, Margaret Sutton. William died in 1965, and ten years later she married Everett Hunting. Margaret Sutton and her husband, William, were among the founding members of the South Nassau Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Freeport, N.Y. Additionally, Sutton was an activist in social causes such as fair housing and participated in the historic \\"March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\\" in 1963. She died at age 98 in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, as Margaret S. Hunting from her second marriage to Everett Hunting. She died of natural causes. Margaret Sutton wrote (but never published) a religious education curriculum, \\"Letters to Live By\\", which was taught in several churches. After her death, two of her daughters, Lindsay Stroh and Marjorie Eckstein, rewrote and updated \\"Letters to Live By\\" and Marjorie finished the illustrations a few weeks before her death at age 91 in 2017.  Judy Bolton  The first Judy Bolton book, was published in 1932, called The Vanishing Shadow. Sutton was best known for writing the Judy Bolton mystery series, which sold more than five million copies. Her Judy Bolton books were advertised as all being based on actual events from Sutton's life. Many of the Judy Bolton stories are based on events from Sutton's hometown, Coudersport, Pennsylvania. Her earlier Judy Bolton books were illustrated by Pelagie Doane, who also illustrated her Magic Maker books. The last Judy Bolton book that Sutton published was The Secret of the Sand Castle, in 1967. The series ended in 1967, before the next book The Strange Likeness could be published. However, In 1997, Linda Joy Singleton privately published Judy Bolton: The Talking Snowman, a new Judy Bolton mystery written by Sutton and Singleton. Sutton began the manuscript for this book in 1980, and years later Singleton finished it with help from Sutton. The incidents in this book placed it between the 3rd and 4th books in the series, leading it to be known as book # 3-1/2. In 2012, with the permission of Margaret Sutton's family, coauthors Kate Duvall and Beverly Hatfield wrote The Strange Likeness based on Margaret Sutton's original title and conversations with the author and her family. It was edited by Margaret Sutton's youngest daughter, Lindsay Sutton Stroh, and illustrated by another daughter, Marjorie Sutton Eckstein. Published by Applewood Books, the volume is #39 in the Judy Bolton Mystery Series.  Other publications  Sutton wrote many books including the Gail Gardner series, Palace Wagon Family, Jemima, Daughter of Daniel Boone, and The Magic Maker series. Sutton did all her own writing and holds the distinction of having the longest lasting juvenile mystery series written by a single author, unlike the series books written by numerous authors by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. A Shepherd Boy of Australia and The Boys of the Ohio Valley were illustrated with photographs.

In the Indian context river flows required for cultural and spiritual needs assumes significance.http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/exec_summary_mail_1_28.pdfhttp://www.eflownet.org/viewinfo.cfm?linkcategoryid=4&linkid;=64&siteid;=1&FuseAction;=display Through implementation of environmental flows, water managers strive to achieve a flow regime, or pattern, that provides for human uses and maintains the essential processes required to support healthy river ecosystems. Environmental flows do not necessarily require restoring the natural, pristine flow patterns that would occur absent human development, use, and diversion but, instead, are intended to produce a broader set of values and benefits from rivers than from management focused strictly on water supply, energy, recreation, or flood control. Rivers are parts of integrated systems that include floodplains and riparian corridors. Collectively these systems provide a large suite of benefits. However, the world's rivers are increasingly being altered through the construction of dams, diversions, and levees. More than half of the world's large rivers are dammed,Nilsson, C., Reidy, C. A., Dynesius, M., and Revenga, C. 2005. Fragmentation and flow regulation of the world's large river systems. Science 308:405-408. a figure that continues to increase. Almost 1,000 dams are planned or under construction in South America and 50 new dams are planned on China's Yangtze River alone.Rivers and Lakes: Reducing the Ecological Impact of Dams Dams and other river structures change the downstream flow patterns and consequently affect water quality, temperature, sediment movement and deposition, fish and wildlife, and the livelihoods of people who depend on healthy river ecosystems.Postel, S., and Richter, B. 2003. Rivers for Life: Managing Water for People and Nature. Island Press, Washington, D.C. Environmental flows seek to maintain these river functions while at the same time providing for traditional offstream benefits. Evolution of environmental flow concepts and recognition From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, water management in developed nations focused largely on maximizing flood protection, water supplies, and hydropower generation. During the 1970s, the ecological and economic effects of these projects prompted scientists to seek ways to modify dam operations to maintain certain fish species. The initial focus was on determining the minimum flow necessary to preserve an individual species, such as trout, in a river. Environmental flows evolved from this concept of \\"minimum flows\\" and, later, \\"instream flows\\", which emphasized the need to keep water within waterways. By the 1990s, scientists came to realize that the biological and social systems supported by rivers are too complicated to be summarized by a single minimum flow requirement.Bunn, S. E., and Arthington, A. H. 2002. Basic principles and ecological consequences of altered flow regimes for aquatic biodiversity. Environmental Management 30:492-507.Richter, B., and Thomas, G. A. 2008. Dam Good Operations. International Water Power and Dam Construction July 2008:14-17. Since the 1990s, restoring and maintaining more comprehensive environmental flows has gained increasing support, as has the capability of scientists and engineers to define these flows to maintain the full spectrum of riverine species, processes and services. Furthermore, implementation has evolved from dam reoperationRichter, B., and Thomas, G. A. 2008. Dam Good Operations. International Water Power and Dam Construction July 2008:14-17. to an integration of all aspects of water management,Dyson, M., Bergkamp, G. J. J., and Scanlon, J., eds. 2003. Flow: The Essentials of Environmental Flows. International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK . including groundwater and surface water diversions and return flows, as well as land use and storm water management. The science to support regional-scale environmental flow determination and management has likewise advanced.Arthington, A. H., Bunn, S. E., Poff, N. L., and Naiman, R. J. 2006. The challenge of providing environmental flow rules to sustain river ecosystems. Ecological Applications 16(4):1311-1318. In a global survey of water specialists undertaken in 2003 to gauge perceptions of environmental flow, 88% of the 272 respondents agreed that the concept is essential for sustainably managing water resources and meeting the long-term needs of people.Moore, M. 2004. Perceptions and interpretations of environmental flows and implications for future water resource management: A survey study. Masters Thesis, Department of Water and Environmental Studies, Link√∂ping University, Sweden. In 2007, the Brisbane Declaration on Environmental Flows was endorsed by more than 750 practitioners from more than 50 countries.The Brisbane Declaration The declaration announced an official pledge to work together to protect and restore the world's rivers and lakes. By 2010, many countries throughout the world had adopted environmental flow policies, although their implementation remains a challenge.Le Quesne, T., Kendy, E., and Weston, D. 2010. The Implementation Challenge: Taking stock of government policies to protect and restore environmental flows. WWF and The Nature Conservancy. Examples One effort currently underway to restore environmental flows is the Sustainable Rivers Project, a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which is the largest water manager in the United States. Since 2002, TNC and the USACE have been working to define and implement environmental flows by altering the operations of USACE dams in 8 rivers across 12 states. Dam reoperation to release environmental flows, in combination with floodplain restoration, has in some instances increased the water available for hydropower production while reducing flood risk. Arizona's Bill Williams River, flowing downstream of Alamo Dam, is one of the rivers featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project. Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam. Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define environmental flows for the Bill Williams River.U.S. Geological Survey, 2006. Defining Ecosystem Flow Requirements for the Bill Williams River, Arizona. Open-File Report 2006-1314. Edited by Shafroth, P.B. and V.B. Beauchamp. While not all of the recommended environmental flow components could be implemented immediately, the USACE has changed its operations of Alamo Dam to incorporate more natural low flows and controlled floods. Ongoing monitoring is capturing resulting ecological responses such as rejuvenation of native willow- cottonwood forest, suppression of invasive and non-native tamarisk, restoration of more natural densities of beaver dams and associated lotic- lentic habitat, changes in aquatic insect populations, and enhanced groundwater recharge. USACE engineers continue to consult with scientists on a regular basis and use the monitoring results to further refine operations of the dam.Shafroth, P., Wilcox, A., Lytle, D., Hickey, J., Andersen, D., Beauchamp, V., Hautzinger, A., McMullen, L., and Warner, A. 2010. Ecosystem effects of environmental flows: modeling and experimental floods in a dryland river. Freshwater Biology 55: 68-85. Another case in which stakeholders developed environmental flow recommendations is Honduras' Patuca III Hydropower Project. The Patuca River, the second longest river in Central America, has supported fish populations, nourished crops, and enabled navigation for many indigenous communities, including the Tawahka, Pech, and Miskito Indians, for hundreds of years. To protect the ecological health of the largest undisturbed rainforest north of the Amazon and its inhabitants, TNC and Empresa Nacional de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica (ENEE, the agency responsible for the project) agreed to study and determine flows necessary to sustain the health of human and natural communities along the river. Due to very limited available data, innovative approaches were developed for estimating flow needs based on experiences and observations of the local people who depend on this nearly pristine river reach.Esselman, P. C., and Opperman, J. J. 2010. Overcoming information limitations for the prescription of an environmental flow regime for a Central American river. Ecology and Society 15(1):6 (online). Methods, tools, and models More than 200 methods are used worldwide to prescribe river flows needed to maintain healthy rivers. However, very few of these are comprehensive and holistic, accounting for seasonal and inter-annual flow variation needed to support the whole range of ecosystem services that healthy rivers provide.Tharme, R. E. 2003. A global perspective on environmental flow assessment: emerging trends in the development and application of environmental flow methodologies for rivers. River Research and Applications 19:397-441. Such comprehensive approaches include DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation),King, J., Brown, C., and Sabet, H. 2003.

D., Warner, A. T., Meyer, J. L., and Lutz, K. 2006. A collaborative and adaptive process for developing environmental flow recommendations.

L., Richter, B. D., Arthington, A. H., Bunn, S. E., Naiman, R. J., Kendy, E., Acreman, M., Apse, C., Bledsoe, B. P., Freeman, M. C., Henriksen, J., Jacobson, R. B., Kennen, J. G., Merritt, D.

The ecological limits of hydrologic alteration (ELOHA): a new framework for developing regional environmental flow standards. Freshwater Biology 55:147-170. The \\"best\\" method, or more likely, methods, for a given situation depends on the amount of resources and data available, the most important issues, and the level of certainty required. To facilitate environmental flow prescriptions, a number of computer models and tools have been developed by groups such as the USACE's Hydrologic Engineering Center to capture flow requirements defined in a workshop setting (e.g., HEC-RPT) or to evaluate the implications of environmental flow implementation (e.g., HEC-ResSim, HEC-RAS, and HEC-EFM). Additionally, a 2D model is developed from a 3D turbulence model based on Smagorinsky large eddy closure to more appropriately model environmental large scale flows.Cao, M. and Roberts, A. J. 2012. Modelling 3D turbulent floods based upon the Smagorinski large eddy closure. Proceedings of the 18th Australasian Fluid Mechanics Conference Published by the Australasian Fluid Mechanics Society. This model is based on a slow manifold of the turbulent Smagorinsky large eddy closure instead of conventional depth-averaging flow equations. Other tried and tested environmental flow assessment methods include DRIFT (King et al. 2003), which was recently used in the Kishenganga HPP dispute between Pakistan and India at the International Court of Arbitration. In India In India, the need for environmental flows has emerged from the hundreds of large dams being planned in the Himalayan rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the Lohit, Dibang River in the Brahmaputra River , the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi River in the Ganga basin and the Teesta in Sikkim for example, would end up in the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about why certain e-flow releases are needed.

History  Fifty years after Lincoln's death (1915), the Illinois General Assembly authorized the Illinois State Historical Library to mark the exact route traveled by Lincoln from Kentucky through Indiana to Illinois. Almost another 50 years passed before the trail was opened in 1963. Author Andrew Ferguson cites Robert Newman, Illinois' director of tourism in the 1960s, as saying \\"the whole thing was cooked up by the marketing guys at the American Petroleum Institute. ...

Route description  As of today, much of the trail is in disrepair and signs are missing or nearly obscured. Yet, some still exist. One sign still stands on US 68 in Perryville, Kentucky. It can be seen when approaching Perryville on US 68 traveling west, as it is at the intersection of US 68, US 150, and KY 52\\\\.

On the train, oil man Jim Gardner makes a pass at her. Catherine asks a cowboy, Dan Somers, to sit nearby as a safety measure. Both are on their way to Oklahoma, with stagecoach driver Despirit Dean tagging along with his friend Dan. Many people in Sapulpa are upset with Jim's business tactics. A farmer feels he was paid too little for his property after Jim discovers oil there. Jim is furious when Dan strongly discourages Chief Big Tree from selling Indian land at too low an offer. Dan travels to Washington, D.C., to ask President Theodore Roosevelt about oil rights. He fought for Teddy and the Rough Riders a few years before. Teddy offers him a chance to transport thousands of barrels of oil to a Tulsa refinery to win the rights over Jim, which leads to Jim's hired man, the Cherokee Kid, setting off an explosion and sabotaging the trip.

They announced it for production in 1942. In December it was announced Frances Hyland was working on the script and that the film would be a vehicle for John Wayne. The film still took a number of months to move into production. Eleanor Griffin and Ethel Hill were hired to work on the script \\"which puts the feature in the big league class\\" according to the Los Angeles Times. They were \\"to give the story the epic flavor.\\" The movie was retitled In Old Oklahoma and filming was to start 15 June. Martha Scott was signed for the female lead, which was seen as a coup for Republic because she was associated with prestigious films such as Our Town (1940). The film was allocated a bigger budget than usual for a Republic Pictures film. =Shooting= Filming took place near Bakersfield. Parts of the film were shot in Johnson Canyon, Paria, Utah, Cedar City, and Virgin, Utah. Release Republic Pictures released it on December 6, 1943. The film did extremely well at the box office and encouraged Republic to make more bigger budgeted films. The movie was reissued in 1947 as War of the Wildcats. =Lawsuit= Screenwriter Griffin's ex-husband, William Rankin, later launched a $115,000 lawsuit against Griffin, Hill, Burtis and Republic, alleging the script included elements in three original scripts of his that he submitted to Republic: Indian Territory, Gasoline War, and Fire in Heaven. He alleged that the writers were hired to combine his scripts into the story of In Old Oklahoma but that he received no compensation.

However, it appears in none of the Canonical gospels of the New Testament but only in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. According to the Gospel of Thomas 98 Jesus said: :\\"The kingdom of the father is like a certain man who wanted to kill a powerful man. In his own house he drew his sword and stuck it into the wall in order to find out whether his hand could carry through. Then he slew the powerful man.\\" Authenticity The scholars of the Jesus Seminar gave the parable of the assassin a \\"pink\\" rating, indicating that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus. They were influenced by parallels with the parables of the tower builder and of the warring king found in the Gospel of Luke (see Counting the cost), and by the \\"scandalous nature of the image.\\" According to Funk (1997), \\"[a]ttributing a parable to Jesus not attested in the canonical gospels, and known only for a few years, was an act of courage that demanded careful deliberation\\". This decision by the Seminar has been criticized for inconsistency, since the parallel parable of the warring king in Luke was not given a pink rating. The authenticity of this parable has been attacked on the grounds that Jesus would not use a parable that glorifies murder, and because of its use of the phrase \\"the Kingdom of the Father\\" which is not found in the canonical gospels. Meaning Like the Lucan parables of the warring king and the tower, this parable seems to concern \\"estimating the cost of an act or the capability to perform it successfully.\\" In Mark, Jesus explains the idea of evil being rehearsed before taking place: \\"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.\\" According to some of the fellows of the Jesus Seminar, \\"the story line of the parable originally had to do with Davidic reversal, as in David and Goliath: The little guy bests the big guy by taking the precautions a prudent person would take before encountering the village bully\\". A similar message can be found in the parable of the strong man.

Jews who escaped Spain during the inquisition were Jewish Sephardic , hence, a significant number of Jewish families in El Salvador have Hebrew hispanized sounding last names. Some of these Sephardic Jewish families include: Aboud, Acevedo, Acosta, Aguilar, Albuquerque, Almeida, Alonzo, Alvarez del Pino, Altamirano, Araujo, Campos, Canizalez, Cantoral, Cordova, Catt√°n, Cuadra, Cubas, D√≠az, Dreyfus, Escalante, Espinosa, Figuereido, Figueroa, Gabay, L√≥pez, N√∫√±ez, Salom√≥n, Sangarr√©n, Sariles, and Taher. Among some of the most prominent Ashkenazi Salvadoran families are: Liebes, Guttfreund, Weill, Salom√≥n, Freund, Lasally, Muyshondt, Gabay, Bloch, Baum, Levy, Lewinsky, Haas, Dreyfus, Rothschild, Tesak, Bernhard, Bloom and Falkenstein. Notable Salvadoran Jews include: Ricardo Freund, businessman and current President of the Comunidad Israelita de El Salvador; Claudio Kahn, businessman and past president of the same organization, M√≥nica Taher, businesswoman, Alejandro Muyshondt, National Security Advisor of El Salvador [5], and Ernesto Muyshondt, Mayor of San Salvador. History of the Jews in El Salvador Business partnership with Catholic conservative landlords during the 1930s hampered Jewish security, but the situation improved after World War II. On Sept. 11, 1948, El Salvador recognized the State of Israel, and in 1956 the Instituto Cultural El Salvador-Israel was founded. Jerusal√©n is a municipality in the La Paz department of El Salvador. It was named by the Cordova family, more specifically by Juan Cordova. They were Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain. Other Sephardic Jews are Escalante's, Figueroas, Figueiras, the Perla y Perla, Oman, Galeas, Galeanos, Gomar, L√≥pez, Perez among others, some of them became members and founders of the Seventh-day Adventist church in the area of Morazan. Right before the Salvadoran Civil War, the Jewish community was actively involved in organizing a Zionist Organization, of which Ernesto Liebes and Carlos Bernhard were its main leaders. Members of the community were also involved. According to American writer Jane Hunter in her book Israeli Foreign Policy: South Africa and Central America, in facilitating the sale of arms from Israel in El Salvador, particularly the sale of 18 Dassault Ouragan jetfighters aircraft in 1973, of which Liebes was perceived by guerrilla groups as the primary representative. Prior to the Civil War, there were about 300 Jews in El Salvador, most of whom lived in the capital. During the Civil War many Jews left the country after the kidnap and murder of a community leader and Israeli Honorary Consul for cultural relations Ernesto Liebes by the RN-FARN, the armed wing of the RN, one of the groups that formed the FMLN. The Comunidad Israelita de El Salvador was established in 1944 with a Jewish community center opening in 1945 and a synagogue in 1950 . The country has now 1 synagogue. Notable Salvadoran Jews include: Ricardo Freund, businessman and current President of the Comunidad Israelita de El Salvador; Claudio Kahn, businessman and past president of the same organization, M√≥nica Taher, businesswoman, Alejandro Muyshondt, National Security Advisor of El Salvador , and Ernesto Muyshondt, Mayor of San Salvador. 1990s The signing of peace treaties in 1991 led to the return of several Jewish couples with children who had moved elsewhere during the Salvadoran civil war. A new community center and synagogue were inaugurated in the past decade. The Comunidad Israelita de El Salvador holds services on Friday, Shabbat morning, and on holy days. For Pesach, Rosh Hashannah, Sukkot, Channukah, Purim and Yom Haatzmaut the women's committee organizes meals for the community to share and celebrate together. University students have a Jewish students association, EJES (Estudiantes Jud√≠os de El Salvador), and a Zionist group, FUSLA (Federaci√≥n de Universitarios Sionistas de Latinoam√©rica), both of which are active throughout the year. For adults, the community offers different educational classes in Hebrew and other topics of interest. The \\"Chevra of Women\\" offers a course in Jewish cooking, and there is a monthly Jewish bulletin called el Kehilat√≥n, which advertises synagogue events. The Noar Shelanu youth movement, to which about 30 children age 8‚Äì18 belong, meets weekly. The kindergarten for young children also meets weekly. Two emissaries teach Hebrew and Judaism. Relations with Israel In 2006, El Salvador announced plans to move the embassy to Tel Aviv where the rest of the embassies are located. This has been met by controversy, with many believing this decision to be under the political influence of the Arab community and the then President, Tony Saca, who is of Christian Arab descent.

The painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo and of various rooms by Raphael in the Apostolic Palace are considered among the masterworks that mark the High Renaissance in Rome. His decision to rebuild St Peter's led to the construction of the present basilica. Julius died in 1513, and except for the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which he lived to see finished, his very largest commissions were finished after his death. Pope Julius II Portrait of Julius II by Raphael, 1511‚Äì12, National Gallery The term High Renaissance was first used by Giorgio Vasari. Artists such as Michelangelo, Raphael and Bramante were at the height of their careers during this time. While Pope Julius II is also remembered as the ‚ÄúWarrior Pope‚Äù for his Machiavellian tactics, he was also given the name of \\"the Renaissance Pope.\\" He modeled his patronage practices on those of his uncle Pope Sixtus IV (1471‚Äì84), and began amassing large personal and public art collections and commissioning numerous civic and religious buildings when he served as a cardinal and Cardinal Archbishop under Pope Nicholas V and Pope Innocent VIII respectively. His additions to the art collection of the Vatican may be Julius II's most impressive venture. He commissioned such projects as the painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the reconstruction of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, and the frescoes of the four large Raphael Rooms, including the Stanza della Segnatura with the School of Athens and other frescos. His reasons for commissioning these, as well as other art works, were varied. They served political, spiritual and aesthetic purposes. Also, during his papacy, the lead up to the Protestant Reformation produced increased tension in Christianity, which caused the Catholic Church to lose influence and political power in Europe. Several of his predecessors were poor, unjust, and impious rulers who caused people to doubt the papal seat and the Vatican‚Äôs monopoly on religion. For these reasons, among others, Julius requested the magnificent and powerful images that are still so recognizable today. When Julius died, several of his commissions were still underway or unfinished at the time of his death. Julius' commissions * 1503‚Äì1512: The Cortile del Belvedere in the Vatican City * 1505‚Äì(1545): Tomb of Julius II * 1505‚Äì(1570s): St Peter's Basilica * 1508‚Äì1512: The Sistine Chapel ceiling * 1509‚Äì1520s: Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Palace * 1511‚Äì1512: Portrait of Julius II by Raphael, following the loss of Bologna Imagery of Julius II On the wall above the main entrance door of the Sistine Chapel fresco of the Prophet Zechariah lower, with the face of Pope Julius II, le below the coat of the same pope. Michelangelo. During his reign, Julius II utilized his iconic status to his advantage, displaying his interest in the arts by placing himself on medals, emblems, and by commissioning specific artworks containing his image. Choosing to commission objects such as medals or coins is quite different from, having a portrait created. A medal or coin can be representative of an ‚Äúantitype‚Äù or ‚Äúmodern counterpart‚Äù to typical, readable typologies that commonly appear in art. The ‚Äútypes‚Äù can serve as a code to decode antiquity, Renaissance or even Baroque art. The most noticeable self-referencing image trend on the coins and works of art commissioned by Julius II was the ‚ÄúDella Rovere oak.\\" In Italian \\"rovere\\" means oak, derived from the Latin robur, meaning strength or oak tree. The Spernadino medal of Giuliano Della Rovere (1488) is a prime example of a representation of the ‚ÄúDella Rovere oak\\". In addition, the giant oak in the Belvedere Courtyard was planted by Julius in 1504 to be incorporated into Bramante's design for the three-tiered area. The Della Rovere coat of arms bore an oak tree and the family was referenced with the emblem of the acorn, which had mythological, Christian, and Republican Roman iconographic associations. Julius II as cardinal (left), with uncle and patron Pope Sixtus IV (right) In reality, however, Julius did not belong to the Della Rovere clan, which was established in Vinovo, near Turin. His uncle Sixtus IV was from a family of merchants and Julius II's own father was a fisherman. Sixtus IV had fabricated a lineage associated with the Della Rovere counts when he was a cardinal and saw an opportunity to ascend to the papal throne. =Raphael's Portrait= In 1511, Julius commissioned two portraits of him by the master Raphael. One is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the other in the National Gallery (London), the latter being the more famous of the two. Several years after its completion, Vasari would comment how it was 'true and lifelike in every way', and the composition became influential, seen in later portraits such as Titian's 'Pope Paul III' of 1543. Julius' long beard was a sign that he had recently lost the state of Bologna, and helps to date the painting, as the beard is recorded as being shaved off in March 1512. Julius II and his Artists Julius first came to appreciate Michelangelo‚Äôs work after seeing his Piet√†, now in St Peter's Basilica, and commissioned him for several key projects: =The Tomb= The tomb of Julius II, with Michelangelo's statues of Rachel and Leah on the left and the right of his Moses. The Tomb of Julius II was originally commissioned in 1505, yet was not completed until 1545 on a much reduced scale: * 1505 ‚Äì Commissioned by Julius; Michelangelo spends 9 months choosing marble at Carrara * 1506 ‚Äì Michelangelo returns to Rome due to a lack of funds available for the project. Bramante and Raphael, apparently jealous of Michelangelo's commission, convince the Pope that it would be bad luck to have his tomb built during his own lifetime, and is dismissed by Julius. Michelangelo, angry and bitter, returns to Florence. Julius, now with his army in a siege against Bologna threatens to wage war on the state unless Michelangelo presents himself and apologises, which he does. Julius give Michelangelo the unwelcome task of creative a huge bronze sculpture of the Pope. This takes two years of incredibly hard work. He then returns to Rome, hoping the Pope will renew his interest in the Tomb project. * 1508 ‚Äì Bramante and Raphael convince the Pope that Michelangelo's time would be better spent on the Sistine Chapel ceiling in the Vatican Palace (assuming that Michelangelo, primarily a sculptor, would have great difficulty in completing a painting of such scale). * 1512 ‚Äì Michelangelo completes the Sistine Chapel ceiling project and returns to the tomb. * 1513 ‚Äì Michelangelo begins three sculptures for the project: the 'Dying Slave' and the 'Rebellious Slave' (now in the Louvre, Paris) and Moses, which is now a part of the final design. When Julius dies the new Pope Leo X abandons the project. * 1516 ‚Äì A new contract is agreed between Michelangelo and Julius' heirs who demand the completion of the project. * 1520s ‚Äì Carves \\"The Genius of Victory\\" and 4 unfinished slaves, which now sit in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence with the David * 1532 ‚Äì A second new contract is signed by Michelangelo which involves a wall-tomb. * 1542 ‚Äì The wall-tomb is begun by Michelangelo after final details are negotiated with Julius' grandson. * 1545 ‚Äì The final tomb is completed, and installed in San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome; it includes the original 'Moses' sculpture along with 'Leah' and 'Rachel' on the lower level, and several other sculptures (definitively not by Michelangelo) on the upper level. St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica One of Pope Julius II‚Äôs largest and most well known commissions was the reconstruction of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, beginning in 1506. When Julius took the papal office, the condition of the Church was extremely poor, and he took the opportunity to expand it, modernize it, and leave his impression forever on the Vatican. Julius hired Donato Bramante to design the Basilica, a prominent architect and artist of the day. This was seen as a surprise move at the time, many thought Giuliano da Sangallo was the front runner for the commission. Della Rovere wanted the splendor of the new basilica to inspire awe in the masses, produce support for Catholicism and prove to his enemies he was a pious and devoted man. Bramante not only would fulfill these expectations with his design, but also with his character, which may explain why della Rovere chose him over Sangallo. ‚ÄúBramante wanted to build a Basilica that would ‚Äòsurpass in beauty, invention, art and design, as well as in grandeur, richness and adornment all the buildings that had been erected in that city‚Äô\\" (Scotti, 47). Raphael came to work for the Pope because of his friendship with Bramante. Bramante had been in Rome working for the Pope when he sent a letter to Raphael telling him that he had convinced Julius to allow Raphael to paint the Stanza della Segnatura. Raphael who had been working on other commissions in Florence immediately dropped his projects and moved to Rome to work for the Pope, but when he arrived he found many great artists painting in the Stanza della Segnatura. When he finished the Vatican Library, he amazed Julius II so much that according to Vasari he chose \\"to destroy all the scenes painted by other masters from the past and present, so that Raphael alone would be honored above all those who labored on the paints which had been done up to that time\\"(Vasari, 314). Motivation behind Julius II's Patronage Generally, scholars have taken one of two sides regarding the many magnificent commissions of Julius II. The first, more widely accepted viewpoint is that Julius was an extravagant patron. He was known by scholars to be a patron purely for selfish motives, imposing aspirations, and a grandiose self-image. (Gosman, 43). Scholars accept that the probable and foremost reason was that it would be a way to forever leave his mark on the Catholic Church. The Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo, \\"an artistic vision without precedent\\" Many argue that Julius was using art to further extend his own Papacy, as well as the role of Popes to come. Julius II‚Äôs Papacy is frequently criticized, for it is a common conception that he was keen for glory, which is reflective in his nickname, ‚ÄúThe Warrior Pope‚Äù (Gosman, 50). The Pope was extremely proud and aspired to be remembered as one of the greatest popes in history. Building Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica, the largest church in the world, certainly added to the Pope‚Äôs r√©sum√©. Many also criticize Julius II for having repeatedly identified himself with Julius Caesar. His desire to emulate Caesar and his extravagant patronage further the negative connotations. Scholars have drawn this conclusion from the medal Julius had made for Saint Peter's with himself on the back, as well as his self-chosen name of Julius. (Gosman, 44) The second, less common stance, is that Julius‚Äôs main motive for his patronage was for his own personal aesthetic pleasure (Gosman, 45). One scholar defends Julius II's patronage by stating: Some scholars argue that these works can not be literally taken as a guide to the ideas of the Pope himself. These scholars point out that it was not solely the patron pulling the strings behind these imposing works of art, but a group of people working together. For example, Julius appears in several of Raphael‚Äôs frescoes, and it is known that he approved his placement in them. However, many modern scholars interpret this fact to mean that Julius simply desired to be painted in the frescoes. (Gosman, 55) Julius was, according to some scholars, a man who appreciated art, took pleasure in building, and merely wanted to create grand places in which to live, and that this motivation was much more important than the desire to project political ideas and images of his power.

Playing career =Wolverhampton Wanderers= A real gentleman, he was a model professional who played the game with great skill and enthusiasm. A pen‚Äìpicture printed in 1889 described him as being \\"clever in ball manipulation and staidley exact distribution.\\" He certainly gave the fans something to cheer about during his two spells with Wanderers. On leaving school Wood played briefly for Walsall Swifts, 1884‚Äì1885, joining Wolves in the summer of 1885 and making his senior debut for the Wanderers in an FA Cup tie against Derby St. Luke's on 31 October 1885. Playing as an inside‚Äìforward, he made his League debut on 6 October 1888, at Thorneyholme Road, the home of Accrington. Harry Wood also scored his debut League goal in this match when he scored to give Wolverhampton Wanderers a 2‚Äì0 lead. The match finished as a 4‚Äì4 draw. Harry Wood, when making his League debut was 20 years 102 days old; which made him, on the fifth weekend of League football, Wolverhampton Wanderers' youngest player in place of David Wykes. Harry Wood appeared in 17 of the 22 League matches played by Wolverhampton Wanderers in season 1888‚Äì89 scoring 13 goals. Harry Wood, playing as an inside‚Äìforward (17 appearances), was part of a Wolverhampton Wanderers forward‚Äìline that scored three League goals or more on eight separate occasions. Harry Wood appeared in all six FA Cup ties in season 1888‚Äì89, scoring in a semi-final reply and being on the losing side in the Final as Wolverhampton Wanderers lost 3‚Äì0 to Preston North End in the Final. Harry Wood top‚Äìscored for Wolverhampton Wanderers in season 1888‚Äì89. His 13 goals included a hat‚Äìtrick scored in a 4‚Äì1 over Derby County at Dudley Road, the then home of Wolverhampton Wanderers. The date was 3 November 1888 and Wood's three was the first League hat‚Äìtrick scored by a Wolverhampton Wanderers player. He also scored two in a match three times, at Turf Moor in a 4‚Äì0 win over Burnley, at Dudley Road in a 4‚Äì1 win over Stoke and again at Dudley Road in a 5‚Äì0 win over Everton (registration & fee required) Wood's first spell at Wolves lasted six years, until July 1891 when he re‚Äìsigned for Walsall Town Swifts. In his first spell Wood scored 46 goals (35 Football League) in 87 League and Cup matches for the Wanderers (60 League); He was also Wolves' top scorer in 1890‚Äì91 (jointly with Sammy Thomson). In his second he netted another 80 goals (74 League) in 202 appearances (181 League), he also top‚Äìscored in season 1892‚Äì93, finishing up with an impressive record of more than 125 goals in just under 300 first‚Äìteam games. He won three full England caps (1890‚Äì1896) and also represented the Football League. He starred in three FA Cup Finals with Wolves, those of 1889, 1893 and 1896, collecting a winners medal in his second against Everton when he led an exceptionally fine match. Wood made 289 appearances and scored 126 goals for Wolverhampton Wanderers. =Southampton= In the summer of 1898, Southampton's trainer, Bill Dawson, was on a short holiday in Stoke when he read in a local paper that Wood had not yet renewed the terms of his contract with Wolves. Dawson tracked Wood down to a Walsall pub and eventually persuaded Wood to sign for the Saints, who had just claimed the Southern League championship for the second consecutive year. According to Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints, \\"Harry Wood stands out as probably the most popular footballer to wear the Saints' colours during the Southern League era.\\". In his first season at The Dell Wood was an ever-present making 24 appearances and scoring 16 goals as Saints took the Southern League championship for the third time. The following season, Saints only managed third place in the league, but reached the FA cup final for the first time in their history, beating three First Division clubs along the way. Unfortunately, the Cup Final was a great disappointment as Saints were swept aside 4‚Äì0 by Bury. In the following season, 1900‚Äì01, Saints once again took the Southern League title, with Wood scoring 10 goals and Edgar Chadwick top- scorer with 14 goals. The 1901‚Äì02 season followed a similar pattern to 1899‚Äì00 with Saints finishing in third place and reaching their second FA Cup final, losing to Sheffield United after a replay. In 1902‚Äì03, Saints won their sixth (and last) Southern League title with Wood only missing two games, scoring 12 goals. By now he was sharing the goal-scoring with John Fraser (15 goals), dab Fred Harrison (17 goals in only 13 games) and Joe Turner (14 goals). Wood's cunning passing earned him the nickname \\"the wolf\\" and for seven years he captained the Saints during their most successful era. In all, he made 180 appearances for the Saints, scoring 65 goals. In his final season at The Dell, the Saints played a testimonial match for Woods against Aston Villa. The \\"gate\\" money raised was ¬£106 5s 6d which was boosted by donations from the Southampton public to make a total benefit cheque of ¬£250 5s. After Southampton After hanging up his boots, Wood was appointed trainer of Portsmouth, a position he held until 1912 when he became landlord of the Milton Arms public house, situated 200 yards from Fratton Park. Wood spent the rest of his life in Portsmouth, where he died on 5 July 1951 at the age of 83. His son, Arthur Wood, also played for Southampton and Clapton Orient.

The air kiss is a pretence of kissing: the lips are pursed as if kissing, but without actually touching the other person's body. Sometimes, the air kiss includes touching cheek-to-cheek. Also, the gesture may be accompanied by the mwah sound.\\"MWAH\\", the BBC programme Keep Your English up to Date The onomatopoeic word mwah (i.e. \\"a representation of the sound of a kiss\\") has entered Webster's dictionary.\\"Mwah in Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English  Western culture  Francesco Totti blowing a kiss at UEFA Euro 2000 A symbolic kiss is frequent in Western cultures. A kiss can be \\"blown\\" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. The term flying kiss is used in India to describe a blown kiss. = North America = In North America and most western countries influenced by North America, air kisses are sometimes associated with glamour models and other celebrities. It is a modified cheek kiss, involving kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching the lips or not.  South-east Asia  In Indonesia, and Malaysia, it is common to air-kiss an elder's hand as a traditional form of respectful greeting. Instead of pursing one's lips, the younger person exhaling through his nose softly on the hand before drawing the hand to the younger person's forehead. In the Philippines, elder relatives traditionally kiss a younger relative's cheek in this same way, by exhaling gently through the nose when the younger relative's cheek is brought close.

Founded in 1954 by brothers Elliot, Robert, and Frank Mackle Jr., and based in Miami, Florida, GDC established several \\"NEW\\" communities in the 1950s & 1960s, and promoted inexpensive Florida homesites worldwide. According to an often repeated story, the Mackle Brothers were selling lots in Miami area and decided to put an ad in a northern newspaper. They received hundreds then thousands of inquiries and began to buy land, plat and sell lots on a ten-year installment basis. Soon they were awash in money and expanded all over Florida ultimately buying several hundred thousand acres and starting many \\"new\\" communities. At the end of the ten year installment period, the company was to develop the roads and drainage, construct and deed the lots. The first half dozen years, however, there was little development expense except for marketing, sales commissions and modest sales offices in the communities. The liabilities for ultimate lots construction loomed, and as construction commenced the cash began to drain out. The solution was to buy, plat and sell more lots to generate the cash flow to construct lots sold a decade earlier. A long term employee who had worked for the company through the 60's and 70's said they felt like a fire was burning behind them, and they had to expand, buying more land and platting and selling more lots, to deliver on previous commitments.  Communities developed by Mackle Bros. and GDC  *Port LaBelle, Florida *Port Charlotte, Florida *North Port, Florida *Port St. John, Florida *Port Malabar, now a subdivision in Palm Bay, Florida *Port St. Lucie, Florida *Sebastian Highlands, Florida *Deltona, Florida *Key Biscayne, Florida *Cumberland Cove, Tennessee Cumberland Cove was the only community outside of Florida developed by GDC. As each community began to be developed the developer built the roads, sewer and water plants, golf courses, marinas, other basic amenities and even operated landfills. These new communities had the feel of \\"company towns.\\" When North Port was incorporated GDC employees even made up the first City Council. In the 1960s GDC's board of directors hired Charles H. Kellstadt, retired Chairman of Sears as President and Chairman. This was just after the GDC board voted to split with the founding Mackle Brothers. The Mackles went on to develop Marco Island and other prominent communities. Kelstadt, it was said, implemented a money back guarantee on homes and lots, similar to what Sears offered. This was a powerful sales tool, and combined with the ability to swap remote lots, or undeveloped lots, for lots in the developed areas, allowed GDC to achieve tremendous sales success, selling several thousand lots each month and several hundred homes. The lot swap program also allowed the company to manage construction schedules and defer construction of new lots. Customers who owned a lot in an as yet undeveloped section, could swap for a lot in a developed area. By the 1970s the company boasted 5,000 employees and a global sales force. In 1974, GDC was a publicly traded company. It was purchased and taken private by City Investing, George T. Scharffenberger, Chairman. Then, in the mid 1980s City Investing took the company public again. In the late 1980s GDC's management team was accused of fraudulent home sales: this led to criminal indictments of the company leadership, and bankruptcy of GDC in 1991. Functional assets held by GDC in various cities were turned over to their respective governments thereafter. Subsequent to the indictments and convictions of senior management, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals exonerated the men, reversing their convictions and directing that all charges against them be dismissed (see US v.

Originally developed by Alfa System, the game was published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released in Japan in 1997. Working Designs licensed the game for the North American market and released it in 1998. Elemental Gearbolt was critically well received due to its science fantasy setting, which is uncommon in light gun shooters, along with its incorporation of RPG elements, and particularly the artistry of its presentation. It features an orchestral soundtrack, and animated cutscenes directed by the anime director Rintaro. Story The events of the game are framed through the character of Tagami (a secret character in Shikigami no Shiro, another title developed by Alfa System), a mysterious figure who travels to the world in which the game is set many centuries after the main events conclude in order to investigate what caused the world's destruction. Tagami relives the tragedy of the Elemental Gearbolt incident. Before the Elemental Gearbolt incident, the world was home to two races, Audo and Sulunkan. The Sulunkan, descendants of a fallen magical empire, were oppressed by the Audo. There are secret resistance groups, but none strong enough to challenge the powerful Audo ruling class. Destiny is set in motion when Nell and Seana, the Sugiku (half breed) daughters of a resistance leader, meet Bel Cain, the Sugiku son of the selfish King Jabugal. Nell and Bel Cain promise to meet again, but other circumstances interfere. Years later, Bel Cain becomes crown prince, full of ambition to end the bitter class struggle. Armed with advanced technology, he starts a campaign of conquest. Meanwhile, Nell and Seana join the Sulunkan resistance, only to be killed. Their bodies are taken back to the capital city as trophies. At the same time, one of Bel Cain's technologies, a Neural Network Computer comprising human brains, malfunctions and initiates a self-destruct sequence. It links powerful weapons known as Holy Guns to Nell and Seana's corpses, re-animating them as Elementals. They have only one purpose - seek and destroy the Network. Bel Cain stands in the Elementals' path, unaware of the actions of the Network; never anticipating his impending reunion and inevitable battle with Nell and Seana. Nell and Seana, now reanimated as elemental war machines, battle their way through the cathedral in the Opening Act: \\"Grieving Angel's Descent\\". They encounter the first of Bel Cain's several powerful armaments, \\"Wardom\\", an executioner-styled armament, and destroy it, after which they start heading towards the forest. Prince Bel Cain is musing on his memories of Nell and Seana, and the promise he made to reunite with them, breaking his amulet in two and giving Nell one half as a reminder. Prince Bel Cain is interrupted as his older brother and subordinate Ialu who tells him that they will reach Owato soon. He also reports to him about the missing supply troops from the garrison due to the fight at the cathedral and that the cause is unknown. The Prince orders replacements to be sent immediately, as well as an advisory to the military police. In Act Two: \\"Enter The Dragon\\", Nell and Seana battle their way through the forest and make their way towards the sea, where they encounter the second of Bel Cain's powerful armaments, \\"Midguld\\", a sea-dragon armament. Once Midguld is destroyed, the elementals make their way towards the Goate mountains. King Jabugal rushes to Prince Bel Cain and Ialu and demands that they attack the rebels of the Republic and take the women as spoils, but Bel Cain dismisses him, telling Ialu he is disgusted by the fact they are blood- related to the king. Bel Cain then briefly visits the Network, revealed to be made of mass amounts of brain-matter of the casualties of war. Bel Cain believes that the people who gave their lives to the Network will find a way to carry out the plans that Bel Cain has carefully laid out, but Bel Cain grows impatient. In Act Three: \\"The Crypt Of Despair\\", Nell and Seana battle their way through a cavern, where they encounter the third of Bel Cain's special armaments, \\"Neethog\\", a large spider-like bioweapon. Once Neethog is destroyed, Nell and Seana progress towards the Plains of Regret. Prince Bel Cain visits his deceased mother, shown to be preserved in a transparent casket mounted as a trophy by King Jabugal. Bel Cain remembers the vow he made, that he would avenge his mother by killing and overthrowing her murderer, King Jabugal. Bel Cain's brother Ialu reports to him that the excavation unit at the Goate Mountains have been destroyed, the cause being one or two armored individuals mounted with incredible weapons headed towards Owato. The King wishes to speak with Bel Cain about the disturbing turn of events. Bel Cain decides to himself that whether the threat is good or evil, he must act decisively. In Act Four: \\"Plains Of Regret\\", Nell and Seana fly across the plains, destroying larger armaments than before. Here, they encounter the largest of Bel Cain's powerful armaments, a powerful war-fortress flying across the sky: \\"Audmra\\". After what would be considered one of the most intense fights in the game, Nell shoots Audmra's core and it is destroyed, crashing to the ground. The two elementals then continue their way towards Owato. Aware of the threat headed towards their location, King Jabugal tries to escape after plundering Owato of its riches. However, Bel Cain shoots the king, killing him in front of on-looking nobles. Bel Cain criticizes the people for blindly following a king who exploited his people, then tells them to cast aside the memory of King Jabugal and bow down before \\"one with a vision of our future\\". The nobles cooperate without hesitation, as Bel Cain decides it is time to show their true strength, as he has a plan. In Act Five: \\"The Palace Ruins\\", Nell and Seana fly through the sky towards the outer rim of Owato and make their way towards the central cathedral, taking out the many armaments that stand in their way. Inside the cathedral, they encounter another powerful armament, \\"Idon\\", an agile creature resembling a lizard. After destroying Idon, the two elementals make their way to the inner depths of the palace. Ialu urges the prince to retreat to safety, but Bel Cain decides to stay, remembering an old memory of a younger Nell telling him that his strength of character will serve him well. Bel Cain tells Ialu he will not run like a coward, but his brother tells him that he does not have the right to choose to die, and has the royal guards escort him to safety by force. In the Final Act: \\"Purposed to Perish\\", Nell and Seana battle their way through the inner depths of the palace to make their way to the Network. As they get closer to the end, They encounter one of the Palace's powerful warriors, \\"Maldel\\" an agile knight. Once Maldel is defeated, the elementals travel down to the hidden depths of the palace, and encounter the monster: \\"Reftraseal\\" A creature resembling a large dragon. Once Reftraseal is destroyed, an entity jumps out of Reftraseal. The entity is nameless and greatly resembles Nell's elemental appearance, and is revealed to be the final boss. After a prolonged battle, the entity is destroyed. The entity was revealed to be piloted by Prince Bel Cain himself in his last-stand. In the epilogue, Prince Bel Cain is found in the wreckage of the battle, mortally wounded (Implied that everyone else including his brother Ialu have already been killed), lamenting on how his carefully set plans and the sacrifices of his subordinates have proven fruitless. Footsteps can be heard, and a black hand lifts the Prince's head up. The Prince notices the amulet the figure is wearing, and immediately recognizes the figure as Nell, his childhood friend. Reunited with his childhood friend again, although unaware that Nell's corpse is controlled by the Holy Gun, the Prince dies with a peaceful expression. Nell carries the corpse of Bel Cain with her and heads towards the Network. She then aims her elemental gun at the Network and fires, destroying it. As the Network falls apart around her, a tear streams down Nell's face, before her armor glows a bright blue color. Having completed the task Nell was reanimated for, a large blue light envelops Nell and Bel Cain and illuminates the entire area, having Nell's body and the Holy Gun perish with Bel Cain in the process. A view of the destroyed area (the same area Tagami visits in the introduction) is seen from afar with people looking on, as Bel Cain's voice is heard speaking to the player: \\"One day, all will put away the destructive desires of self, striving only to create a world without barriers. I failed. You must succeed.\\" The game ends and credits start to roll, along with small journal entries that appear in between, written by Tagami. The journal entries reveal that Tagami came from another dimension and was the one who gave the Network access to the holy guns, anticipating the malfunction of the Network to mount the holy guns to Nell and Seana's bodies. The life expectancy of their bodies were limited to 24 hours, the exact amount of time needed for the holy gun to complete the operation of destroying Bel Cain's kingdom, which was a success. Due to an accident with the dimensional gate, Tagami's return to her world was impossible, until the gate gets repaired. She then enters cryogenic suspension until the gate can be repaired, making this her final journal entry for centuries. She makes a private note, reading \\"Farewell, Yuri. I shall always love you.\\" Tagami writes, centuries later: \\"Today, I picked up an old pendant...\\" referencing Bel Cain's half of the old pendant she found in the pre-game introduction. Gameplay As is the norm with rail shooters, the action in Elemental Gearbolt takes place from a first-person perspective, and the pace of the game and rate of enemy occurrence is completely preset. The player is only required to aim and shoot with the light gun. Most light gun games require the player to reload as ammunition is expended, but Elemental Gearbolt does not, since both the player characters and their weapons are magical. Instead, the game limits the speed at which the player can fire, increasing the need for accuracy. The player can switch freely between three types of attacks - Blaze Phoenix, a basic, high powered shot; Thunder Tiger, a spread shot; and Water Snake, a rapid shot. At the conclusion of each stage the player has the opportunity to \\"Trade Off\\", in which the player selects certain percentages of the score for the stage to allocate towards bonus points or experience. As in an RPG, the player characters gain levels by accruing experience, and thus grow more powerful and are better able to take damage. Score determines rank, and in the year following the game's North American release it was used to participate in contests sponsored by Working Designs. Music The official soundtrack features a 24¬Ω-minute drama track in Japanese and 19 original score cues performed by a full orchestra. It was released by First Smile Entertainment on January 21, 1998 in Japan. Its catalogue ID is FSCA-10030 and the original price in Japan was 2,548¬•. Kei Wakakusa composed and arranged the score. Promotion Some winners of Working Designs' contests for Elemental Gearbolt received 'Assassin Case' prizes that contained gold-plated GunCon light guns. These Assassin Cases are among the most rare and prized collectibles from the PlayStation era. Reception According to Metacritic, the game received the average score of 76 (\\"Generally favorable reviews\\").

Typical reasons include divorcing or separating from their spouse, refusing to enter an arranged, child or forced marriage, being in a relationship or having associations with social groups outside the family that is strongly disapproved by one's family, having premarital or extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape or sexual assault, dressing in clothing, jewelry and accessories which are deemed inappropriate, engaging in non-heterosexual relations Though both men and women commit and are victims of honor killings, in some cultures the code of honor has different standards for men and women, including stricter standards for chastity for women and duty for men to commit violent acts if demanded by honor. In some cases, the honor code is part of a larger social system that subjugates women to men. These asymmetries, combined with the predominance of heterosexual relationships and male perpetrators of violence, mean honor killings are disproportionately violence against women. Prevention and punishment of honor killings and similar crimes of passion are issues of interest to local and international advocates for women's rights, men's rights, LGBT rights, freedom of religion, and groups against domestic violence in general. Honor killing is a type of domestic violence in the broadest sense of violence within a family (not limited to intimate partner violence, which is another common meaning of the term). The justice systems of some countries, whether by explicit provisions or by lack of enforcement of existing laws, either does not prosecute or dispense reduced penalties for killings committed in the name of family honor. Some jurisdictions have more lenient penalties for crimes of passion committed without premeditation (such as murder immediately upon discovery of adultery), or explicitly have reduced penalties for a husband who kills a cheating wife (but not necessarily the reverse). Special treatment of crimes of passion apply whether or not the killing is made in the name of honor, but perpetrators of honor killings can benefit from these rules, and the exceptions raise similar objections from anti-violence advocates. Definitions Human Rights Watch defines \\"honor killings\\" as follows: > Honor crimes are acts of violence, usually murder, committed by male family > members against female family members who are perceived to have brought > dishonor upon the family. A woman can be targeted by her family for a > variety of reasons including, refusing to enter into an arranged marriage, > being the victim of a sexual assault, seeking a divorce‚Äîeven from an abusive > husband‚Äîor committing adultery. The mere perception that a woman has acted > in a manner to bring \\"dishonor\\" to the family is sufficient to trigger an > attack. Men can also be the victims of honor killings by members of the family of a woman with whom they are perceived to have an inappropriate relationship, or by partaking in gay activities.Afghan couple stoned to death ‚Äì Central & South Asia. Al Jazeera English (16 August 2010). Retrieved 1 October 2011. In some cases of honor killing that were brought before German courts murder charges have been reduced to manslaughter. This has been called the \\"honor defense\\". General characteristics Many honor killings are planned by multiple members of a family, sometimes through a formal \\"family council\\". The threat of murder is used as a means to control behavior, especially concerning sexuality and marriage, which may be seen as a duty for some or all family members to uphold. Family members may feel compelled to act to preserve the reputation of the family in the community and avoid stigma or shunning, particularly in tight-knit communities. Perpetrators often do not face negative stigma within their communities, because their behavior is seen as justified. Honor killings of older victims are often perpetrated by the husband, but in 44% of cases, the killers also include family members of either the victim or the husband. Honor killings of younger women were in 81% of cases perpetrated by their family of origin and 53% of the younger victims were tortured before they died. Extent The incidence of honor killings is very difficult to determine and estimates vary widely. In most countries data on honor killings is not collected systematically, and many of these killings are reported by the families as suicides or accidents and registered as such. Although honor killings are often associated with the Asian continent, especially the Middle East and South Asia, they occur all over the world.http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/svaw/advocacy/modelsessions/what_is_GBV.PDF In 2000, the United Nations estimated that 5,000 women were victims of honor killings each year. According to BBC, \\"Women's advocacy groups, however, suspect that more than 20,000 women are killed worldwide each year.\\" Murder is not the only form of honor crime, other crimes such as acid attacks, abduction, mutilations, and beatings occur; in 2010 the UK police recorded at least 2,823 such crimes. Methods Methods of killing include stoning, stabbing, beating, burning, beheading, hanging, throat slashing, lethal acid attacks, shooting, and strangulation. The killings are sometimes performed in public to warn the other individuals within the community of possible consequences of engaging in what is seen as illicit behavior. Use of minors as perpetrators Often, minor girls and boys are selected by the family to act as the killers, so that the killer may benefit from the most favorable legal outcome. Boys and sometimes women in the family are often asked to closely control and monitor the behavior of their sisters or other females in the family, to ensure that the females do not do anything to tarnish the 'honor' and 'reputation' of the family. The boys are often asked to carry out the murder, and if they refuse, they may face serious repercussions from the family and community for failing to perform their \\"duty\\". Culture =General cultural features= The cultural features which lead to honor killings are complex. Honor killings involve violence and fear as a tool for maintaining control. Honor killings are argued to have their origins among nomadic peoples and herdsmen: such populations carry all their valuables with them and risk having them stolen, and they do not have proper recourse to law. As a result, inspiring fear, using aggression, and cultivating a reputation for violent revenge to protect property is preferable to other behaviors. In societies where there is a weak rule of law, people must build fierce reputations. In many cultures where honor is of a central value, men are sources, or active generators/agents of that honor, while the only effect that women can have on honor is to destroy it. Once the family's or clan's honor is considered to have been destroyed by a woman, there is a need for immediate revenge to restore it, for the family to avoid losing face in the community. As Amnesty International statement notes: The relation between social views on female sexuality and honor killings are complex. The way through which women in honor-based societies are considered to bring dishonor to men is often through their sexual behavior. Indeed, violence related to female sexual expression has been documented since Ancient Rome, when the pater familias had the right to kill an unmarried sexually active daughter or an adulterous wife. In medieval Europe, early Jewish law mandated stoning for an adulterous wife and her partner. Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, an anthropology professor at Rhode Island College, writes that an act, or even alleged act, of any female sexual misconduct, upsets the moral order of the culture, and bloodshed is the only way to remove any shame brought by the actions and restore social equilibrium. However, the relation between honor and female sexuality is a complicated one, and some authors argue that it is not women's sexuality per se that is the 'problem', but rather women's self-determination in regard to it, as well as fertility. Sharif Kanaana, professor of anthropology at Birzeit University, says that honor killing is: In some cultures, honor killings are considered less serious than other murders simply because they arise from long-standing cultural traditions and are thus deemed appropriate or justifiable. Additionally, according to a poll done by the BBC's Asian network, 1 in 10 of the 500 young South Asians surveyed said they would condone any murder of someone who threatened their family's honor. Nighat Taufeeq of the women's resource center Shirkatgah in Lahore, Pakistan says: \\"It is an unholy alliance that works against women: the killers take pride in what they have done, the tribal leaders condone the act and protect the killers and the police connive the cover-up.\\"Culture of Discrimination: A Fact Sheet on \\"Honor\\" Killings . Amnestyusa.org. Retrieved 1 October 2011. The lawyer and human rights activist Hina Jilani says, \\"The right to life of women in Pakistan is conditional on their obeying social norms and traditions.\\" A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing. It also comments that the practice is not related to a feudal societal structure, \\"there are also perpetrators who are well-educated university graduates. Of all those surveyed, 60 percent are either high school or university graduates or at the very least, literate.\\" In contemporary times, the changing cultural and economic status of women has also been used to explain the occurrences of honor killings. Women in largely patriarchal cultures who have gained economic independence from their families go against their male-dominated culture. Some researchers argue that the shift towards greater responsibility for women and less for their fathers may cause their male family members to act in oppressive and sometimes violent manners to regain authority. This change of culture can also be seen to affect Western cultures such as Britain among South Asian and Middle Eastern communities where honor killings often target women seeking greater independence and adopting seemingly Western values. For families who trace their ancestry back to the Middle East or South Asia, honor killings have targeted women for wearing clothes that are considered Western, having a boyfriend, or refusing to accept an arranged marriage Fareena Alam, editor of a Muslim magazine, writes that honor killings which arise in Western cultures such as Britain are a tactic for immigrant families to cope with the alienating consequences of urbanization. Alam argues that immigrants remain close to the home culture and their relatives because it provides a safety net. She writes that Alam argues that it is thus the attempt to regain control and the feelings of alienation that ultimately leads to an honor killing. =Specific triggers of honor killings= Refusal of an arranged or forced marriage Refusal of an arranged marriage or forced marriage is often a cause of an honor killing. The family that has prearranged the marriage risks disgrace if the marriage does not proceedhttps://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf and the betrothed is indulged in a relationship with other individual without prior knowledge of the family members. Seeking a divorce A woman attempting to obtain a divorce or separation without the consent of the husband/extended family can also be a trigger for honor killings. In cultures where marriages are arranged and goods are often exchanged between families, a woman's desire to seek a divorce is often viewed as an insult to the men who negotiated the deal. By making their marital problems known outside the family, the women are seen as exposing the family to public dishonor. Allegations and rumors about a family member In certain cultures, an allegation against a woman can be enough to tarnish her family's reputation, and to trigger an honor killing: the family's fear of being ostracized by the community is enormous. Victims of rape In many cultures, victims of rape face severe violence, including honor killings, from their families and relatives. In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are considered to have brought 'dishonor' or 'disgrace' to their families. This is especially the case if the victim becomes pregnant. Central to the code of honor, in many societies, is a woman's virginity, which must be preserved until marriage.http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/5180/1/STARV24N1-2A4.pdf?origin=publication_detail Suzanne Ruggi writes, \\"A woman's virginity is the property of the men around her, first her father, later a gift for her husband; a virtual dowry as she graduates to marriage.\\" Homosexuality There is evidence that homosexuality can also be perceived as grounds for honor killing by relatives. It is not only same-sex sexual acts that trigger violence‚Äîbehaviors that are regarded as inappropriate gender expression (e.g. male acting or dressing in a \\"feminine way\\") can also raise suspicion and lead to honor violence. In one case, a gay Jordanian man was shot and wounded by his brother. In another case, in 2008, a homosexual Turkish-Kurdish student, Ahmet Yildiz, was shot outside a cafe and later died in the hospital. Sociologists have called this Turkey's first publicized gay honor killing.The German Democratic Turkey Forum (DTF) has prepared a report with details on the killing and the subsequent court case; accessed on 31 March 2011. In 2012, a 17-year-old gay youth was murdered by his father in Turkey in the southeastern province of Diyarbakƒ±r. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees states that \\"claims made by LGBT persons often reveal exposure to physical and sexual violence, extended periods of detention, medical abuse, the threat of execution and honor killing.\\"UNHCR Guidance Note on Refugee Claims Relating to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, II, B. para 14. Unhcr.org (21 November 2008). Retrieved 1 October 2011. Forbidden male partners In many honor-based cultures, a woman maintains her honor through her modesty. If a man disrupts a woman's modesty, through dating her, having sex with her (especially if her virginity was lost), talking to her, the man has dishonored the woman, even if the relationship is consensual. Thus to restore the woman's lost honor, the male members of her family will often beat and kill the offender. Sometimes, violence extends to the offender's family members, since honor feud attacks are seen as family conflicts. Causes There are multiple causes for which honor killings occur, and numerous factors interact with each other. =Views on women= Honor killings are often a result of strongly misogynistic views towards women and the position of women in society. In these traditionally male-dominated societies, women are dependent first on their father and then on their husbands, whom they are expected to obey. Women are viewed as property and not as individuals with their own agency. As such, they must submit to male authority figures in the family‚Äîfailure to do so can result in extreme violence as punishment. Violence is seen as a way of ensuring compliance and preventing rebellion. According to Shahid Khan, a professor at the Aga Khan University in Pakistan: \\"Women are considered the property of the males in their family irrespective of their class, ethnic, or religious group. The owner of the property has the right to decide its fate. The concept of ownership has turned women into a commodity which can be exchanged, bought and sold\\". In such cultures, women are not allowed to take control over their bodies and sexuality: these are the property of the males of the family, the father (and other male relatives) who must ensure virginity until marriage; and then the husband to whom his wife's sexuality is subordinated‚Äîa woman must not undermine the ownership rights of her guardian by engaging in premarital sex or adultery. =Cultures of honor and shame= The concept of family honor is extremely important in many communities worldwide. The UN estimates that 5,000 women and girls are murdered each year in honor killings, which are widely reported in the Middle East and South Asia, but they occur in countries as varied as Brazil, Canada, Iran, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Egypt, Sweden, Syria, Uganda, United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. In honor cultures, managing reputation is an important social ethic. Men are expected to act tough and be intolerant of disrespect and women are expected to be loyal to the family and be chaste. An insult to your personal or family honor must be met with a response, or the stain of dishonor can affect many others in the family and the wider community. Such acts often include female behaviors that are related to sex outside marriage or way of dressing, but may also include male homosexuality (like the emo killings in Iraq). The family may lose respect in the community and may be shunned by relatives. The only way they perceive that shame can be erased is through an honor killing. The cultures in which honor killings take place are usually considered \\"collectivist cultures\\", where the family is more important than the individual, and individual autonomy is seen as a threat to the family and its honor. Though it may seem in a modern context that honor killings are tied to certain religious traditions, the data does not support this claim. Research in Jordan found that teenagers who strongly endorsed honor killings in fact did not come from more religious households than teens who rejected it. The ideology of honor is a cultural phenomenon that does not appear to be related to religion, be it Middle Eastern or Western countries, and honor killings likely have a long history in human societies which predate many modern religions. In the US, a rural trend known as the \\"small-town effect\\" exhibit elevated incidents of argument-related homicides among white males, particularly in honor-oriented states in the South and the West, where everyone \\"knows your name and knows your shame.\\" This is similarly observed in rural areas in other parts of the world. Honor cultures pervade in places of economic vulnerability and with the absence of the rule of law, where law enforcement cannot be counted on to protect them. People then resort to their reputations to protect them from social exploitation and a man must \\"stand up for himself\\" and not rely on others to do so. To lose your honor is to lose this protective barrier. Possessing honor in such a society can grant social status and economic and social opportunities. When honor is ruined, a person or family in an honor culture can be socially ostracized, face restricted economic opportunities, and have a difficult time finding a mate. =Laws and European colonialism= Legal frameworks can encourage honor killings. Such laws include on one side leniency towards such killings, and on the other side criminalization of various behaviors, such as extramarital sex, \\"indecent\\" dressing in public places, or homosexual sexual acts, with these laws acting as a way of reassuring perpetrators of honor killings that people engaging in these behaviors deserve punishment. In the Roman Empire the Roman law Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis implemented by Augustus Caesar permitted the murder of daughters and their lovers who committed adultery at the hands of their fathers and also permitted the murder of the adulterous wife's lover at the hand of her husband. The Napoleonic Code did not allow women to murder unfaithful husbands, while it permitted the murder of unfaithful women by their husbands. The Napoleonic Code Article 324 which was passed in 1810 permitted the murders of an unfaithful wife and her lover at the hand of her husband. It was abolished only in 1975. On 7 November 1975, Law no. 617/75 Article 17 repealed the 1810 French Penal Code Article 324. The 1810 penal code Article 324 passed by Napoleon was copied by Middle Eastern Arab countries. It inspired Jordan's Article 340 which permits the murder of a wife and her lover if caught in the act at the hands of her husband. France's 1810 Penal Code Article 324 also inspired the 1858 Ottoman Penal Code's Article 188, both the French Article 324 and Ottoman article 188 were drawn on to create Jordan's Article 340 which was retained even after a 1944 revision of Jordan's laws which did not touch public conduct and family law so Article 340 still applies to this day.http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context;=isp_collection France's Mandate over Lebanon resulted in its penal code being imposed there in 1943‚Äì1944, with the French-inspired Lebanese law for adultery allowing the mere accusation of adultery against women resulting in a maximum punishment of two years in prison while men have to be caught in the act and not merely accused, and are punished with only one year in prison. France's Article 324 inspired laws in other Arab countries such as: * Algeria's 1991 Penal Code Article 279 * Egypt's 1937 Penal Code no. 58 Article 237 *Iraq's 1966 Penal Code Article 409 * Jordan's 1960 Penal Code no. 16 Article 340 * Kuwait's Penal Code Article 153 * Lebanon's Penal Code Articles 193, 252, 253 and 562 ** These were amended in 1983, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999 and were eventually repealed by the Lebanese Parliament on 4 August 2011 * Libya's Penal Code Article 375 * Morocco's 1963 amended Penal Code Article 418 * Oman's Penal Code Article 252 * Palestine, which had two codes: Jordan's 1960 Penal Code 1960 in the West Bank and British Mandate Criminal Code Article 18 in the Gaza Strip ** These were respectively repealed by Article 1 and Article 2 and both by Article 3 of the 2011 Law no. 71 which was signed on 5 May 2011 by president Mahmoud Abbas into the 10 October 2011 Official Gazette no. 91 applying in the Criminal Code of Palestine's Northern Governorates and Southern Governorates * Syria's 1953 amended 1949 Penal Code Article 548 * Tunisia's 1991 Penal Code Article 207 (which was repealed) * United Arab Emirate's law no.3/1978 Article 334 * Yemen's law no. 12/1994 Article 232 A similar situation is found in Pakistan's penal code, which was based on the 1860 code imported by Britain to rule colonial India, where a man who killed his wife for ‚Äúgrave and sudden provocation\\" was given a lenient sentencing. In 1990, Pakistan reformed this law to bring it in terms with the Shari'a, and the Pakistani Federal Shariat Court declared that ‚Äúaccording to the teachings of Islam, provocation, no matter how grave and sudden it is, does not lessen the intensity of crime of murder.‚Äù However, judges still sometimes hand down lenient sentences for honor killings, justified by still citing the British law's ‚Äúgrave and sudden provocation.\\" Forced suicide as a substitute A forced suicide may be a substitute for an honor killing. In this case, the family members do not directly kill the victim themselves, but force him or her to commit suicide, in order to avoid punishment. Such suicides are reported to be common in southeastern Turkey. It was reported that in 2001, 565 women lost their lives in honor-related crimes in Ilam, Iran, of which 375 were reportedly staged as self-immolation.Amnesty International (July 2008). Human Rights Abuses against the Kurdish Minority. London: Amnesty International. Available at https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE13/088/2008/en/d140767b-5e45- 11dd-a592-c739f9b70de8/mde130882008eng.pdf [downloaded 15 July 2009] In 2008, self-immolation \\"occurred in all the areas of Kurdish settlement (in Iran), where it was more common than in other parts of Iran\\". It is claimed that in Iraqi Kurdistan many deaths are reported as \\"female suicides\\" in order to conceal honor-related crimes.Kurdish Human Rights Project European Parliament Project: The Increase in Kurdish Women Committing Suicide Final Report Restoring honor through a forced marriage In the case of an unmarried woman or girl associating herself with a man, losing virginity, or being raped, the family may attempt to restore its 'honor' with a 'shotgun wedding'. The groom will usually be the man who has 'dishonored' the woman or girl, but if this is not possible the family may try to arrange a marriage with another man, often a man who is part of the extended family of the one who has committed the acts with the woman or girl. This being an alternative to an honor killing, the woman or girl has no choice but to accept the marriage. The family of the man is expected to cooperate and provide a groom for the woman. Religion Widney Brown, the advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said that the practice \\"goes across cultures and religions\\". Resolution 1327 (2003) of the Council of Europe states that: Many Muslim commentators and organizations condemn honor killings as an un-Islamic cultural practice.John Esposito (2011), What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam, p. 177. Oxford University Press. . There is no mention of honor killing (extrajudicial killing by a woman's family) in either the Qur'an or the Hadiths, and the practice violates Islamic law. Tahira Shaid Khan, a professor of women's issues at Aga Khan University, blames such killings on attitudes (across different classes, ethnic, and religious groups) that view women as property with no rights of their own as the motivation for honor killings. Pdf via unl.edu Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid asserts that the punishment of any crime is only reserved for the Islamic ruler. Ali Gomaa, Egypt's former Grand Mufti, has also spoken out forcefully against honor killings. As a more generic statement reflecting the wider Islamic scholarly trend, Jonathan A. C. Brown says that \\"questions about honor killings have regularly found their way into the inboxes of muftis like Yusuf Qaradawi or the late Lebanese Shiite scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. Their responses reflect a rare consensus. No Muslim scholar of any note, either medieval or modern, has sanctioned a man killing his wife or sister for tarnishing her or the family's honor. If a woman or man found together were to deserve the death penalty for fornication, this would have to be established by the evidence required by the Qur'an: either a confession or the testimony of four male witnesses, all upstanding in the eyes of the court, who actually saw penetration occur.\\"Jonathan A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy, Oneworld Publications (2014), p. 180 Further, while honor killings are common in Muslim countries like Pakistan or the Arab nations, it is a practically unknown practice in many other Muslim countries too, such as Indonesia or Senegal. This fact supports the idea that honor killings are to do with culture rather than religion. The late Yemeni Muslim scholar Mu·∏•ammad al-ShawkƒÅnƒ´ wrote that one reason the Shari'a stipulates execution as a potential punishment for men who murder women is to counter honor killings for alleged slights of honor. He wrote, ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that laxity on this matter is one of the greatest means leading to women‚Äôs lives being destroyed, especially in the Bedouin regions, which are characterized by harsh- hardheartedness and a strong sense of honor and shame stemming from Pre- Islamic times.‚ÄùMu·∏•ammad b. øAlƒ´ al-ShawkƒÅnƒ´, Nayl al-Aw·π≠ƒÅr, ed.  øIzz al-Dƒ´n Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb, 8 vols. (Beirut: DƒÅr I·∏•yƒÅ‚Äô al-TurƒÅth al- øArabƒ´, 2001), 7:24 In history Matthew A. Goldstein, J.D. (Arizona), has noted that honor killings were encouraged in ancient Rome, where male family members who did not take action against the female adulterers in their families were \\"actively persecuted\\". The origin of honor killings and the control of women is evidenced throughout history in the cultures and traditions of many regions. The Roman law of pater familias gave complete control to the men of the family over both their children and wives. Under these laws, the lives of children and wives were at the discretion of the men in their families. Ancient Roman Law also justified honor killings by stating that women who were found guilty of adultery could be killed by their husbands. During the Qing dynasty in China, fathers and husbands had the right to kill daughters who were deemed to have dishonored the family. Among the Indigenous Aztecs and Incas, adultery was punishable by death. During John Calvin's rule of Geneva, women found guilty of adultery were punished by being drowned in the Rh√¥ne river. Honor killings have a long tradition in Mediterranean Europe. According to the Honour Related Violence ‚Äì European Resource Book and Good Practice (page 234): \\"Honor in the Mediterranean world is a code of conduct, a way of life and an ideal of the social order, which defines the lives, the customs and the values of many of the peoples in the Mediterranean moral\\".http://www.medinstgenderstudies.org/wp- content/uploads/hrvresourcebook.pdf By region According to the UN in 2002: In addition, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights gathered reports from several countries and considering only the countries that submitted reports it was shown that honor killings have occurred in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, and Uganda. According to Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, the practice of honor killing \\"goes across cultures and religions.\\" =Europe= Memorial plaque for Hatun S√ºr√ºc√º in Berlin, Germany. The Kurdish woman from Turkey was murdered at age of 23 by her brothers in an honor killing. The issue of honor killings has risen to prominence in Europe in recent years, prompting the need to address the occurrence of honor killings. The 2009 European Parliamentary Assembly noted this in their Resolution 1681 which noted the dire need to address honor crimes. The resolution stated that: The Honour Based Violence Awareness Network (HBVA) writes: The majority of honor killings are committed by first generation immigrants against second and third generation to prevent them from becoming Westernized. Albania Honor-based violence has a long tradition in Albania, and although it is much rarer today than it was in the past, it still exists. The Kanun is a set of traditional Albanian laws and customs. Honor (in Albanian: Nderi) is one of the four pillars on which the Kanun is based. Honor crimes happen, especially in northern Albania. In Albania (and in other parts of the Balkans) the phenomenon of blood feuds between males was more common historically than honor killings of females, but honor-based violence against women and girls also has a tradition.http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2011/xhaho_armela.pdf Belgium In 2011, Belgium held its first honor killing trial, in which four Pakistani family members were found guilty of killing their daughter and sibling, Sadia Sheikh. As a legacy of the very influential Napoleonic Code, before 1997, Belgian law provided for mitigating circumstances in the case of a killing or an assault against a spouse caught in the act of adultery.http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/36305/1/ULg- Liber%20amicorum%20Bosly%20-%20Masset.pdf. (Adultery itself was decriminalized in Belgium in 1987.) Denmark Ghazala Khan was shot and killed in Denmark in September 2005, by her brother, after she had married against the will of the family. She was of Pakistani origin. Her murder was ordered by her father to save her family's 'honor' and several relatives were involved. Sentences considered harsh by Danish standards were handed out to all nine accused members of her family, and permanent banishment was ordered for those who were not Danish citizens.  Finland  The first case of an honor killing in Finland happened in 2015 when an Iraqi man was sentenced to two years in prison for planning to murder his 16-year-old sister. He was also sentenced for assault. He and their mother had forbidden his sister from meeting people her own age and leaving the home beyond going to school. In 2019, a 48-year-old Iraqi attempted to murder his 40-year-old ex-wife because she was associated with other men. The stabbing was done at an educational institution where both were studying. When she turned around, he stabbed her in the back. She was seriously wounded but survived. According to the accused, he was ridiculed by his friends because the couple had arrived in Finland in 2015 and divorced shortly after arriving. France France has a large immigrant community from North Africa (especially from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) and honor-based violence occurs in this community.Geesy, Patricia \\"North African Immigrants in France: Integration and Change\\" 1995 Substance 77(76) p137. A 2009 report by the Council of Europe cited the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, and Norway as countries where honor crimes and honor killings occur. France traditionally provided for leniency concerning honor crimes, particularly when they were committed against women who had committed adultery. The Napoleonic Code of 1804, established under Napoleon Bonaparte, is one of the origins of the legal leniency concerning adultery-related killings in a variety of legal systems in several countries around the world. Under this code, a man who killed his wife after she had been caught in the act of adultery could not be charged with premeditated murder‚Äîalthough he could be charged with other lesser offenses. This defense was available only for a husband, not for a wife. The Napoleonic Code has been very influential, and many countries, inspired by it, provided for lesser penalties or even acquittal for such crimes. This can be seen in the criminal codes of many former French colonies. Germany Investigating criminal records for partner homicides from the years 1996‚Äì2005, the German Federal Criminal Police Office concluded that there were about 12 cases of honor killings in Germany per year, including cases involving collective family honor and individual male honor, out of an average about 700 annual homicides. An accompanying study of all homicides in Baden-W√ºrttemberg shows that men from Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Albania have a between three and five times overrepresentation for partner homicides, both honor and non-honor-related. The causes for the higher rate were given as low education and social status of these groups along with cultural traditions of violence against women. In 2005 Der Spiegel reported: \\"In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been killed by family members\\". The article went on to cover the case of Hatun S√ºr√ºc√º, a Turkish-Kurdish woman who was killed by her brother for not staying with the husband she was forced to marry, and for \\"living like a German\\". Precise statistics on how many women die every year in such honor killings are hard to come by, as many crimes are never reported, said Myria Boehmecke of the T√ºbingen-based women's group Terre des Femmes. The group tries to protect Muslim girls and women from oppressive families. The Turkish women's organization Papatya has documented 40 instances of honor killings in Germany since 1996. Hatun S√ºr√ºc√º's brother was convicted of murder and jailed for nine years and three months by a German court in 2006. In 2001, Turkish immigrant Mikdat Sacin murdered his 18-year-old daughter Funda Sacin as she refused to marry her cousin from Ankara, Turkey in a forced marriage and secretly married her boyfriend instead. Mikdat S. has fled to his home country Turkey and has yet to come before a court. In 2005, twenty-five-year-old Turkish man Ali Karabey murdered his sister G√∂nul Karabey for having a German boyfriend. \\"She disgraced the family\\", he testified and he felt called upon to punish her with death. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by a German court in 2006. In 2008, Afghan Morsal Obeidi was murdered by her brother in Hamburg. \\\\- Original German version: - PDF page In 2010, Turkish immigrant and devout Muslim Mehmet √ñzkan murdered his 15-year-old daughter B√ºsra √ñzkan because she refused to live an Islamic lifestyle and would chat with a young man she recently met. In 2016 a Kurdish Yazidi woman was shot dead at her wedding in Hannover for allegedly refusing to marry her cousin in a forced marriage. Italy Similar to other Southern/Mediterranean European areas, the honor was traditionally important in Italy. Indeed, until 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances for such killings; until 1981 the law read: \\"Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offense to his honor or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.\\"http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf Traditionally, honor crimes used to be more prevalent in Southern Italy. In 1546, Isabella di Morra, a young poet from Valsinni, Matera, was stabbed to death by her brothers for a suspected affair with a married nobleman, whom they also murdered.Marilyn Migiel, Juliana Schiesari, Refiguring Woman: Perspectives on Gender and the Italian Renaissance, Cornell University Press, 1991, p.247 In 2006, twenty-year-old Hina Saleem, a Pakistani woman who lived in Brescia, Italy, was murdered by her father who claimed he was \\"saving the family's honour\\". She had refused an arranged marriage, and was living with her Italian boyfriend. In 2009, in Pordenone, Italy, Sanaa Dafani, an 18-year-old girl of Moroccan origin, was murdered by her father because she had a relationship with an Italian man. In 2011, in Cerignola, Italy, a man stabbed his brother 19 times because his homosexuality was a \\"dishonour to the family\\". Norway Anooshe Sediq Ghulam was a 22-year-old Afghan refugee in Norway, who was killed by her husband in an honor killing in 2002. She had reported her husband to the police for domestic violence and was seeking a divorce. Sweden The Swedish National Police Board and the Swedish Prosecution Authority define honor-related crime as crimes against a relative who, according to the perpetrator and his family's point of view, has dishonored the family. These crimes are intended to prevent the family from honor being damaged or to restore damaged or lost family honor. The most serious honor-related crime is often organized and deliberate and not limited to killing. Incidents include torture, forced suicides, forced marriages, rapes, kidnapping, assault, mortal threats, extortion, and protecting a criminal. The 26-year-old Iraqi Kurdish woman Fadime ≈ûahindal was killed by her father in 2002 in Uppsala in Sweden.vgs.univie.ac.at/_TCgi_Images/vgs/20080527171708_HSK27_Wikan.pdf Kurdish organizations were criticized by prime minister G√∂ran Persson for not doing enough to prevent honor killings. Pela Atroshi was a Kurdish girl who was shot by her uncle in an honor killing in Iraqi Kurdistan. The murder of Pela and Fadime gave rise to the formation of GAPF (the acronym stands for Never Forget Pela and Fadime), a politically and religiously independent and secular nonprofit organization working against honor-related violence and oppression. The organization's name is taken from Pela Atroshi and Fadime ≈ûahindal which are Sweden's best-known and high-profile cases of honor killings. The honor killing of Sara, an Iraqi Kurdish girl, was the first publicized honor killing in Sweden. Sara was killed by her brother and cousin when she was 15 years old. According to statements by her mother, Sara's brother believed that she \\"was a whore who slept with Swedish boys\\", and that even though he himself also slept with Swedish girls that \\"was different, because he is a male, and he would not even think of sleeping with Iraqi girls, only with Swedish girls, with whores\\". These three prominent cases brought the notion of honor killings into Swedish discourse. In 2016 ten out of the 105 murder cases were honor killings, with 6 females and 4 male victims. The 6 female victims represented a third of the 18 murders of women in Sweden that year. In May 2019 the court of appeals found a man guilty of murdering his wife in front of the Afghan couple's children who were minor at the time. He was sentenced to life in prison, deportation and a lifetime ban against returning to Sweden. Switzerland In 2010, a 16-year-old Pakistani girl was killed near Z√ºrich, Switzerland, by her father who was dissatisfied with both her lifestyle and her Christian boyfriend. In 2014, a forty-two-year-old Syrian Kurd killed his wife (and cousin) because she had a boyfriend and wanted to live separately. The suspect defended himself by claiming that honor killing is part of Kurdish culture. United Kingdom Every year in the United Kingdom (UK), officials estimates that at least a dozen women are victims of honor killings, almost exclusively within Asian and Middle Eastern families. Often, cases cannot be resolved due to the unwillingness of families, relatives and communities to testify. A 2006 BBC poll for the Asian network in the UK found that one in ten of the 500 young Asians polled said that they could condone the killing of someone who had dishonored their families. In the UK, in December 2005, Nazir Afzal, Director, west London, of Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, stated that the United Kingdom has seen \\"at least a dozen honour killings\\" between 2004 and 2005. In 2010, Britain saw a 47% rise in the number of honor-related crimes. Data from police agencies in the UK report 2283 cases in 2010, and an estimated 500 more from jurisdictions that did not provide reports. These \\"honor-related crimes\\" also include house arrests and other parental punishments. Most of the attacks were conducted in cities that had high immigrant populations. One of the earliest prosecuted cases in the UK was that of 19-year-old Rukhsana Naz, who was forced to marry her second cousin from Pakistan at age 15. She embarked on an affair with the man she had really wanted to marry, fell pregnant and was murdered by her mother and brother for refusing to terminate her pregnancy and remain in her forced marriage. Banaz Mahmod, a 20-year-old Iraqi Kurdish woman from Mitcham, south London, was killed in 2006, in a murder orchestrated by her father, uncle and cousins. Her life and murder were presented in a documentary called Banaz: A Love Story, directed and produced by Deeyah Khan. The investigation into her disappearance and murder was dramatised in the 2020, two-part ITV mini-series, Honour, starring Keeley Hawes. Another well- known case was Heshu Yones, stabbed to death by her Kurdish father in London in 2002, because he thought she'd become too \\"westernized\\" and was involved in a relationship of which he didn't approve. Other examples include the killing of Tulay Goren, a Kurdish Shia Muslim girl who immigrated with her family from Turkey, and Samaira Nazir (Pakistani Muslim). A highly publicized case was that of Shafilea Iftikhar Ahmed, a 17-year-old British Pakistani girl from Great Sankey, Warrington, Cheshire, who was murdered in 2003 by her parents. However, a lesser-known case is that of Gurmeet Singh Ubhi, a Sikh man who, in February 2011, was found guilty of the murder of his 24-year-old daughter, Amrit Kaur Ubhi in 2010. Ubhi was found to have murdered his daughter because he disapproved of her being \\"too westernized\\". Likewise, he also disapproved of the fact that she was dating a non-Sikh man.Sikh dad strangled daughter who was in a relationship with white soldier. mirror.co.uk. Retrieved 1 October 2011. In 2012, the UK had the first white victim of an honor killing: 17-year- old Laura Wilson was killed by her Asian boyfriend, Ashtiaq Ashgar, because she revealed details of their relationship to his family, challenging traditional cultural values of the Asian family. Laura Wilson's mother said, \\"I honestly think it was an honor killing for putting shame on the family. They needed to shut Laura up and they did.\\" Wilson was repeatedly knifed to death as she walked along a canal in Rotherham. In 2013, Mohammed Inayat was jailed for killing his wife and injuring three daughters by setting his house on fire in Birmingham. Inayat wanted to stop his daughter from flying to Dubai to marry her boyfriend, because he believed the marriage would dishonor his family. In 2013, the husband of Syrian-born 25-year-old Rania Alayed was jailed for her murder. His two brothers were also jailed for perverting the course of justice in relation to the disposal of her body, which has never been found. According to the prosecution, the motive for the murder was that she had become \\"too westernised\\" and was \\"establishing an independent life\\". =Middle East and North Africa= Honor killings in Maghreb are not as common as in the Asian countries of the Middle East and South Asia, but they do occur. In Libya, they are particularly committed against rape victims. In a poll with respondents across countries in the Arab world such as Algeria (27%), Morocco (25%), Sudan (14%), Jordan (21%), Tunisia (8%), Lebanon (8%), and the Palestinian territory of the West Bank (8%), it was found that honor killings were more acceptable than homosexuality. Egypt Honor killings in Egypt occur due to reasons such as a woman meeting an unrelated man, even if this is only an allegation; or adultery (real or suspected). The exact number of honor killings is not known, but a report in 1995 estimated about 52 honor killings that year.https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw- gp-2005/docs/experts/khafagy.honorcrimes.pdf In 2013, a woman and her two daughters were murdered by 10 male relatives, who strangled and beat them, and then threw their bodies in the Nile. Honor killings are illegal in Egypt and five of the ten men were arrested. Iran In Iran, there have been a number of recorded cases of honor killings that made international headlines. Iraq In 2008, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) has stated that honor killings are a serious concern in Iraq, particularly well documented in Iraqi Kurdistan. There are conflicting estimates on the number of honor killings in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Free Women's Organization of Kurdistan (FWOK) released a statement on International Women's Day 2015 noting that \\"6,082 women were killed or forced to commit suicide during the past year in Iraqi Kurdistan, which is almost equal to the number of the Peshmerga martyred fighting Islamic State (IS),\\" and that a large number of women were victims of honor killings or enforced suicide--mostly self-immolation or hanging. According to Zhin Woman magazine, published in December 2015 in Sulaimaniya, from January to August 2015, in the three main Kurdish provinces of Sulaimaniya, Erbil, and Duhok, there were a total of 122 cases of honor killings and 124 women's suicides. According to KRG Ministry of Interior's Directorate-General of Countering Violence Committed Against Women, only 14 women were victims of \\"so-called\\" honor killings in 2017. The practice is reportedly declining due to increased numbers of women's rights organizations and government initiatives.http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/130220181 About 500 honor killings per year are reported in hospitals in Iraqi Kurdistan, although real numbers are likely higher. It is speculated that alone in Erbil there is one honor killing per day. The UNAMI reported that at least 534 honor killings occurred between January and April 2006 in the Kurdish Governorates.http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2007/393248/IPOL- FEMM_ET(2007)393248_EN.pdf Kurdish Human Rights Project European Parliament Project: The Increase in Kurdish Women Committing Suicide Final Report It is claimed that many deaths are reported as \\"female suicides\\" in order to conceal honor-related crimes. Aso Kamal of the Doaa Network Against Violence claimed that they have estimated that there were more than 12,000 honor killings in Iraqi Kurdistan from 1991 to 2007. He also said that the government figures are much lower, and show a decline in recent years, and Kurdish law has mandated since 2008 that an honor killing be treated like any other murder. Honor killings and other forms of violence against women have increased since the creation of Iraqi Kurdistan, and \\"both the KDP and PUK claimed that women's oppression, including 'honor killings', are part of Kurdish 'tribal and Islamic culture'\\".https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/pratt/publications/mjcc_004_03_06_al- ali_and_pratt.pdf The honor killing and self-immolation condoned or tolerated by the Kurdish administration in Iraqi Kurdistan has been labeled as \\"gendercide\\" by Mojab (2003).Shahrzad Mojab. (2003). Kurdish Women in the Zone of Genocide and Gendercide. Al-Raida 21(103): 20‚Äì25. PDF As many as 133 women were killed in the Iraqi city of Basra alone in 2006. Seventy-nine were killed for violation of \\"Islamic teachings\\" and 47 for honor, according to IRIN, the news branch of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Amnesty International says that armed groups, not the government, also kill politically active women and those who did not follow a strict dress code, as well as women who are perceived as human rights defenders. Seventeen-year-old Du'a Khalil Aswad, an Iraqi girl of the Yazidi faith, was stoned to death in front of a mob of about 2,000 men in 2007, possibly because she was allegedly planning to convert to Islam. A video of the brutal incident was released on the Internet. According to the crowd she had \\"shamed herself and her family\\" for failing to return home one night and there were suspicions of her converting to Islam to marry her boyfriend, who was in hiding in fear of his own safety. Jordan A 2008 report of the National Council of Family Affairs in Jordan, an NGO affiliated with the Queen of Jordan, indicated that the National Forensic Medicine Center recorded 120 murdered women in 2006, with 18 cases classified officially as crimes of honor.\\"Status of Violence against Women in Jordan\\" , National Council for Family Affairs, 2008, Amman, Jordan In 2013, the BBC cited estimates by the National Council of Family Affairs in Jordan, an NGO, that as many as 50 Jordanian women and girls had been killed in the preceding 13 years. But the BBC indicated \\"the real figure\\" was probably \\"far higher,\\" because \\"most honor killings go unreported.\\"Maher, Ahmed, [\\"Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings'\\"], 20 June 2013, BBC News Men used to receive reduced sentences for killing their wives or female family members if they are deemed to have brought dishonor to their family. Families often get sons under the age of 16‚Äîlegally minors‚Äîto commit honor killings; the juvenile law allows convicted minors to serve time in a juvenile detention center and be released with a clean criminal record at the age of 16. Rana Husseini, a leading journalist on the topic of honor killings, states that \\"under the existing law, people found guilty of committing honor killings often receive sentences as light as six months in prison\\". According to UNICEF, there are an average of 23 honor killings per year in Jordan. On 1 August 2017, article 98 in the penal codes were amended to exclude honor criminals from receiving lenient punishments for being in \\"a state of great fury\\". However, article 340 which sees reduced penalties when a man attacks or kills a female relative having found her in the act of \\"adultery\\", is still in effect. A 2013 survey of \\"856 ninth-graders‚Äîaverage age of 15‚Äîfrom a range of secondary schools across Amman‚Äîincluding private and state, mixed-sex and single-gender\\" showed that attitudes favoring honor killings are present in the \\"next generation\\" Jordanians: \\"In total, 33.4% of all respondents either \\"agreed\\" or \\"strongly agreed\\" with situations depicting honor killings. Boys were more than twice as likely to support honor killings: 46.1% of boys and 22.1% of girls agreed with at least two honor killing situations in the questionnaire.\\" The parents' education was found to be a significant correlation: \\"61% of teenagers from the lowest level of educational background showed supportive attitudes towards honor killing, as opposed to only 21.1% where at least one family member has a university degree.\\" Kuwait Kuwait is relatively liberal and honor killings are rare, but not unheard of‚Äîin 2006 a young woman died in an honor killing committed by her brothers. In 2008, a girl was given police protection after reporting that her family intended to kill her for having an affair with a man. Lebanon There are no exact official numbers about honor killings of women in Lebanon; many honor killings are arranged to look like accidents, but the figure is believed to be 40 to 50 per year. A 2007 report by Amnesty International said that the Lebanese media in 2001 reported 2 or 3 honor killings per month in Lebanon, although the number is believed to be higher by other independent sources. On 4 August 2011, however, the Lebanese Parliament agreed by a majority to abolish Article 562, which for the past years had worked as an excuse to commute the sentence given for honor killing. Palestine According to UNICEF estimates in 1999, two-thirds of all murders in the Palestinian territories were likely honor killings.UNICEF Executive Director targets violence against women. UNICEF. 7 March 2000 In 2005, 22-year-old Faten Habash, a Christian from West Bank, was said to have dishonored her family by falling for a young Muslim man, Samer. Following their thwarted attempts to elope to Jordan, she suffered her relatives' wrath after rejecting the options of either marrying her cousin or becoming a nun in Rome. She had spent a period of time in hospital recovering from a broken pelvis and various other injuries caused by an earlier beating by her father and other family members. Still fearing her family after her release from the hospital, she approached a powerful Bedouin tribe, which took her under its care. Her father then wept and gave his word that he would not harm her. She returned to him, only to be bludgeoned to death with an iron bar days later.

The Syrian civil war has been reported as leading to an increase in honor killings in the country, mainly due to the common occurrence of war rape, which led to the stigmatization of victims by their relatives and communities, and in turn to honor killings. Turkey A report compiled by the Council of Europe estimated that over 200 women were killed in honor killings in Turkey in 2007. A June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in Istanbul alone there was one honor killing every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years. It added that metropolitan cities were the location of many of these, due to growing immigration to these cities from the East. The mass migration during the past decades of rural population from Southeastern Turkey to big cities in Western Turkey has resulted in relatively more developed cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Bursa having the highest numbers of reported honor killings.http://middlab.middlebury.edu/files/2111/04/Honor-Killings-essay1.pdf A report by UNFPA identified the following situations as being common triggers for honor killings: a married woman having an extra-marital relationship; a married woman running away with a man; a married woman getting separated or divorced; a divorced woman having a relationship with another man; a young unmarried girl having a relationship; a young unmarried girl running away with a man; a woman (married or unmarried) being kidnapped and/or raped. In Turkey, young boys are often ordered by other family members to commit the honor killing, so that they can get a shorter jail sentence (because they are minors). Forced suicides‚Äîwhere the victim who is deemed to have 'dishonored' the family is ordered to commit suicide in an attempt by the perpetrator to avoid legal consequences‚Äîalso take place in Turkey, especially in Batman in southeastern Turkey, which has been nicknamed \\"Suicide City\\". In 2009 a Turkish news agency reported that a 2-day-old boy who was born out of wedlock had been killed for honor in Istanbul. The maternal grandmother of the infant, along with six other persons, including a doctor who had reportedly accepted a bribe to not report the birth, were arrested. The grandmother is suspected of fatally suffocating the infant.

Ahmet Yildiz, 26, a Turkish-Kurdish physics student who represented his country at an international gay conference in the United States in 2008, was shot dead leaving a cafe in Istanbul. Ahmet Yildiz who came from a deeply religious family was believed to have been the victim of the country's first gay honor killing. Honor killings continue to receive some support in the conservative regions of Turkey. In 2005, A small survey in Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off. A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing. It also comments that the practice is not related to a feudal societal structure, \\"there are also perpetrators who are well-educated university graduates. Of all those surveyed, 60 percent are either high school or university graduates or at the very least, literate.\\" There are well- documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing. The most recent was on 13 January 2009, where a Turkish Court sentenced five members of the same Kurdish family to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Naile Erdas, a 16-year-old girl who got pregnant as a result of rape.Daughter pregnant by rape, killed by family ‚Äì World.

Yemen Honor killings are common in Yemen. In some parts of the country, traditional tribal customs forbid contact between men and women before marriage. Yemeni society is strongly male dominated, Yemen being ranked last of 135 countries in the 2012 Global Gender Gap Report.http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf It was estimated that in 1997 about 400 women and girls died in honor killings in Yemen. In 2013, a 15-year-old girl was killed by her father, who burned her to death, because she talked to her fianc√© before the wedding. =South Asia= Afghanistan In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honor killings, but the total number is believed to be much higher. Of the reported honor killings, 21% were committed by the victims' husbands, 7% by their brothers, 4% by their fathers, and the rest by other relatives. In May 2017, United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan concluded that the vast majority of cases involving honor killings and murders of women, perpetrators were not punished.

India Honor killings have been reported in northern regions of India, mainly in the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The main reason for these crimes is a result of people marrying without their family's acceptance, especially when it is between members of two different castes or religious groups, or, more particular to northwestern India, between members of the same gotra, or exogamous clan. In contrast, honor killings are less prevalent but are not completely non-existent the western Indian states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

According to Pakistani activists Hina Jilani and Eman M Ahmed, Indian women are considerably better protected against honor killings by Indian law and government than Pakistani women, and they have suggested that governments of countries affected by honor killings use Indian law as a model to prevent honor killings in their respective societies. In June 2010, scrutinizing the increasing number of honor killings, the Supreme Court of India demanded responses about honor killing prevention from the federal government and the state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Alarmed by the rise of honor killings, the Government planned to bring a bill in the Monsoon Session of Parliament July 2010 to provide for deterrent punishment for 'honor' killings. In 2000 Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu (nicknamed Jassi), a Canadian Punjabi who married rickshaw driver Sukhwinder Singh Sidhu (nicknamed Mithu) against her family's wishes, was brutally murdered in India following orders from her mother and uncle in Canada so that \\"the family honor was restored\\".

Scholars suggest that the Islamic law doctrine of Qisas and Diyya encourages honor killings, particularly against females, as well as allows the murderer to go unpunished.Shahid M.

Only one case in China is considered by some as an honor killing. On 15 April 2017, Ma Ruibao, a Hui resident of Zhongning County in Ningxia, murdered his daughter, her boyfriend and the taxi driver who drove the couple home. =The Americas= Brazil Throughout the 20th century, husbands have used the \\"legitimate defense of their honor\\" (leg√≠tima defesa da honra) as justification for adultery-related killings in court cases. Although this defense was not explicitly stipulated in the 20th-century Criminal Code, it has been successfully pleaded by lawyers throughout the 20th century, in particular in the interior of the country, though less so in the coastal big cities. In 1991 Brazil's Supreme Court explicitly rejected the \\"honor defense\\" as having no basis in Brazilian law. Canada A 2007 study by Dr. Amin Muhammad and Dr. Sujay Patel of Memorial University, Canada, investigated how the practice of honor killings has been brought to Canada. The report explained that \\"When people come and settle in Canada they can bring their traditions and forcefully follow them. In some cultures, people feel that some boundaries are never to be crossed, and if someone would violate those practices or go against them, then killing is justified to them.\\" The report noted that \\"In different cultures, they can get away without being punished‚Äîthe courts actually sanction them under religious contexts\\". The report also said that the people who commit these crimes are usually mentally ill and that the mental health aspect is often ignored by Western observers because of a lack of understanding of the insufficiently developed state of mental healthcare in developing countries in which honor killings are prevalent. Canada has been host to a number of high-profile killings, including the murder of Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu, the murder of Amandeep Atwal, the double murder of Khatera Sadiqi and her fianc√©, and the Shafia family murders. Honor killings have become such a pressing issue in Canada that the Canadian citizenship study guide mentions it specifically, saying, \\"Canada's openness and generosity do not extend to barbaric cultural practices that tolerate spousal abuse, 'honor killings', female genital mutilation, forced marriage or other gender-based violence.\\" United States Phyllis Chesler argues that the U.S., as well as Canada, do not have proper measures in place to fight against honor killings, and they do not recognize these murders as a specific form of violence, distinct from other domestic murders, due to fear of being labeled \\"culturally insensitive\\". According to her, this often prevents government officials in the United States and the media from identifying and accurately reporting these incidents as \\"honor killings\\" when they occur. Failing to accurately describe the problem makes it more difficult to develop public policies to address it, she argues. She also writes that, although there are not many cases of honor killing within the United States, the overwhelming majority of honor killings are perpetrated by Muslims against Muslims (90% of honor killings known to have taken place in Europe and the United States from 1998 to 2008). In these documented cases the victims were murdered because they were believed to have acted in a way that was against the religion of the family. In every case, the perpetrators view their victims as having violated rules of religious conduct and they act without remorse. Several honor killings have occurred in the U.S. during recent years. In 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri, 16-year-old Palestina \\"Tina\\" Isa was murdered by her Palestinian father with the aid of his wife. Her parents were dissatisfied with her \\"westernized\\" lifestyle. In 2008, in Georgia, 25-year-old Sandeela Kanwal was killed by her Pakistani father for refusing an arranged marriage. Amina and Sarah Said, two teenage sisters from Texas were killed, allegedly by their Egyptian father, Yaser Abdel Said, who was at large until his capture in Texas in August 2020. Aasiya Zubair was, together with her husband Muzzammil Hassan, the founder and owner of Bridges TV, the first American Muslim English-language television network. She was killed by her husband in 2009. Phyllis Chesler argues that this crime was an honor killing. In 2009, in Arizona, Noor Almaleki, aged 20, was killed by her father, an Iraqi immigrant, because she had refused an arranged marriage and was living with her boyfriend. The extent of honor-based violence in the U.S. is not known, because no official data is collected. There is controversy about the reasons why such violence occurs, and about the extent to which culture, religion, and views on women cause these incidents. Latin America Crimes of passion within Latin America have also been compared to honor killings. As with honor killings, crimes of passion often feature the murder of a woman by a husband, family member, or boyfriend, and the crime is often condoned or sanctioned. In Peru, for example, 70 percent of the murders of women in one year were committed by a husband, boyfriend, or lover, and most often jealousy or suspicions of infidelity are cited as the reasons for the murders. El Salvador ranks the worst in the world on the UN rankings of femicide. The view that violence can be justified in the name of honor and shame exists traditionally in Latin American societies, and machismo is often described as a code of honor. While some ideas originated in the Spanish colonial culture, others predate it: in the early history of Peru, the laws of the Incas allowed husbands to starve their wives to death if they committed adultery, while Aztec laws in early Mexico stipulated stoning or strangulation as punishment for female adultery. Until a few decades ago, the marriage of a girl or woman to the man who had raped her was considered a \\"solution\\" to the incident in order to restore her family's 'honor'. In fact, although laws that exonerate the perpetrator of rape if he marries his victim after the rape are often associated with the Middle East, such laws were very common around the world until the second half of the 20th century. As late as 1997, fourteen Latin American countries had such laws although most of these countries have since abolished them. Such laws were ended in Mexico in 1991, El Salvador in 1996, Colombia in 1997, Peru in 1999, Chile in 1999,No Paradise Yet: The World's Women Face the New Century, edited by Judith Mirsky, Marty Radlett, pg 145 Brazil in 2005, Uruguay in 2005, Guatemala in 2006,\\"Until 2006, a rapist could be exonerated if he promised to marry his victim, unless she was under twelve years old.\\" Guatemala Human Rights Commission/USA, \\"For Women's Right to Live: FAQs.\\" Costa Rica in 2007,https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/beijingat10/D.%20Violence%20against%20women%20%28Sep%2009%29.pdf Panama in 2008, Nicaragua in 2008, Argentina in 2012, and Ecuador in 2014. =Oceania= Australia Jim Spigelman (who served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales from 19 May 1998 until 31 May 2011) said that Australia's increasing diversity was creating conflicts about how to deal with the customs and traditions of immigrant populations. He said: \\"There are important racial, ethnic and religious minorities in Australia who come from nations with sexist traditions which, in some respects, are even more pervasive than those of the West.\\" He said that honor crimes, forced marriages and other violent acts against women were becoming a problem in Australia. In 2010, in New South Wales, Indonesian born Hazairin Iskandar and his son killed the lover of Iskandar's wife. Iskandar stabbed the victim with a knife while his son bashed him with a hammer. The court was told that the reason for the murder was the perpetrators' belief that extramarital affairs were against their religion; and that the murder was carried out to protect the honor of the family and was a \\"pre-planned, premeditated and executed killing\\". The judge said that: \\"No society or culture that regards itself as civilized can tolerate to any extent, or make any allowance for, the killing of another person for such an amorphous concept as an honor\\".http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/sydney-man-guilty-of- honour-killing/story-e6frea7l-1226410139724 Pela Atroshi was a Kurdish 19-year-old girl who was killed by her uncle in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1999. The decision to kill her was taken by a council of her male relatives, led by Pela's grandfather, Abdulmajid Atroshi, who lived in Australia. One of his sons, Shivan Atroshi, who helped with the murder, also lived in Australia. Pela Atroshi was living in Sweden, but was taken by family members to Iraqi Kurdistan to be killed, as ordered by a family council of male relatives living in Sweden and Australia because they claimed she had tarnished the family honor. Pela Atroshi's murder was officially deemed an honor killing by authorities. International response Honor killings are condemned as a serious human rights violation and are addressed by several international instruments. Honor killings are opposed by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/66 (adopted in 2000) and subsequent resolutions, which have generated various reports. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence addresses this issue. Article 42 reads: The World Health Organization (WHO) addressed the issue of honor killings and stated: \\"Murders of women to 'save the family honor' are among the most tragic consequences and explicit illustrations of embedded, culturally accepted discrimination against women and girls.\\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77421/1/WHO_RHR_12.38_eng.pdf According to the UNODC: \\"Honour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence. It assumes that a woman's behavior casts a reflection on the family and the community. ... In some communities, a father, brother, or cousin will publicly take pride in a murder committed to preserving the 'honor' of a family. In some such cases, local justice officials may side with the family and take no formal action to prevent similar deaths.\\"http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison- reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf In national legal codes Legislation on this issue varies, but today the vast majority of countries no longer allow a husband to legally kill a wife for adultery (although adultery itself continues to be punishable by death in some countries) or to commit other forms of honor killings. However, in many places, adultery and other \\"immoral\\" sexual behaviors by female family members can be considered mitigating circumstances in the case when they are killed, leading to significantly shorter sentences. In the Western world, a country that is often associated with \\"crimes of passion\\" and adultery related violence is France, and indeed, recent surveys have shown the French public to be more accepting of these practices than the public in other countries. One 2008 Gallup survey compared the views of the French, German and British public and those of French, German and British Muslims on several social issues: 4% of the French public said \\"honor killings\\" were \\"morally acceptable\\" and 8% of the French public said \\"crimes of passion\\" were \\"morally acceptable\\"; honor killings were seen as acceptable by 1% of German public and also 1% of the British public; crimes of passion were seen as acceptable by 1% of German public and 2% of the British public. Among Muslims, 5% in Paris, 3% in Berlin, and 3% in London saw honor killings as acceptable, and 4% in Paris (less than the French public), 1% in Berlin, and 3% in London saw crimes of passion as acceptable. According to the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 2002 concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83): The legal aspects of honor killings in different countries are discussed below: *Jordan: In recent years, Jordan has amended its Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings. *Many former French colonies offer the possibility of reduced sentences regarding adultery related violent crimes (inspired by the French Napoleonic Code). *In Brazil, an explicit defense to murder in case of adultery has never been part of the criminal code, but a defense of \\"honor\\" (not part of the criminal code) has been widely used by lawyers in such cases to obtain acquittals. Although this defense has been generally rejected in modern parts of the country (such as big cities) since the 1950s, it has been very successful in the interior of the country. In 1991 Brazil's Supreme Court explicitly rejected the \\"honor\\" defense as having no basis in Brazilian law. *Haiti: In 2005, the laws were changed, abolishing the right of a husband to be excused for murdering his wife due to adultery. Adultery was also decriminalized. *Syria: In 2009, Article 548 of the Syrian Law code was amended. Beforehand, the article waived any punishment for males who murdered a female family member for inappropriate sexual acts. Article 548 states that \\"He who catches his wife or one of his ascendants, descendants or sister committing adultery (flagrante delicto) or illegitimate sexual acts with another and he killed or injured one or both of them benefits from a reduced penalty, that should not be less than two years in prison in case of killing.\\" Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. In addition to this, Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim. *Turkey: In Turkey, persons found guilty of this crime are sentenced to life in prison. There are well documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing. The most recent was on 13 January 2009, where a Turkish Court sentenced five members of the same Kurdish family to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Naile Erdas, 16, who got pregnant as a result of rape. *Pakistan: Honor killings are known as karo kari () (). The practice is supposed to be prosecuted under the ordinary killing, but in practice police and prosecutors often ignore it. Often a man must simply claim the killing was for his honor and he will go free. Nilofar Bakhtiar, advisor to Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, stated that in 2003, as many as 1,261 women were killed in honor killings. The Hudood Ordinances of Pakistan, enacted in 1979 by then ruler General Zia-ul-Haq, created laws that realigned Pakistani rule with Islamic law. The law had the effect of reducing the legal protections for women, especially regarding sex outside of the marriage. Women who made accusations of rape, after this law, were required to provide four male witnesses. If unable to do this, the alleged rape could not be prosecuted in the courts. Because the woman had admitted to sex outside of marriage, however, she could be punished for having sex outside of the marriage, a punishment that ranged from stoning to public lashing. This law made it that much riskier for women to come forward with accusations of rape. In 2006, the Women's Protection Bill amended these Hudood Ordinances by removing four male witnesses as a requirement for rape allegations. On 8 December 2004, under international and domestic pressure, Pakistan enacted a law that made honor killings punishable by a prison term of seven years, or by the death penalty in the most extreme cases. In 2016, Pakistan repealed the loophole which allowed the perpetrators of honor killings to avoid punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from another family member, and thus be legally pardoned. *Egypt: Several studies on honor crimes by The Centre of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, includes one which reports on Egypt's legal system, noting a gender bias in favor of men in general, and notably article 17 of the Penal Code: judicial discretion to allow reduced punishment in certain circumstance, often used in honor killings case. Support and sanction Actions of Pakistani police officers and judges (particularly at the lower level of the judiciary\\"Honor Killings in Pakistan\\" . Amnesty.org. Retrieved 10/19/11.) have, in the past, seemed to support the act of honor killings in the name of family honor. Police enforcement, in situations of admitted murder, does not always take action against the perpetrator. Also, judges in Pakistan (particularly at the lower level of the judiciary), rather than ruling cases with gender equality in mind, also seem to reinforce inequality and in some cases sanction the murder of women considered dishonorable. Often, a suspected honor killing never even reaches court, but in cases where they do, the alleged killer is often not charged or is given a reduced sentence of three to four years in jail. In a case study of 150 honor killings, the proceeding judges rejected only eight claims that the women were killed for honor. The rest were sentenced lightly. In many cases in Pakistan, one of the reasons honor killing cases never make it to the courts, is because, according to some lawyers and women's right activists, Pakistani law enforcement do not get involved. Under the encouragement of the killer, police often declare the killing as a domestic case that warrants no involvement. In other cases, the women and victims are too afraid to speak up or press charges. Police officials, however, claim that these cases are never brought to them, or are not major enough to be pursued on a large scale. The general indifference to the issue of honor killing within Pakistan is due to a deep-rooted gender bias in law, the police force, and the judiciary. In its report, \\"Pakistan: Honor Killings of Girls and Women\\", published in September 1999, Amnesty International criticized governmental indifference and called for state responsibility in protecting human rights of female victims. To elaborate, Amnesty strongly requested the Government of Pakistan to take 1) legal, 2) preventive, and 3) protective measures. First of all, legal measures refer to a modification of the government's criminal laws to guarantee equal legal protection of females. On top of that, Amnesty insisted the government assure legal access for the victims of crime in the name of honor. When it comes to preventive measures, Amnesty underlined the critical need to promote public awareness through the means of media, education, and public announcements. Finally, protective measures include ensuring a safe environment for activists, lawyers, and women's groups to facilitate the eradication of honor killings. Also, Amnesty argued for the expansion of victim support services such as shelters. Kremlin-appointed Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov said that honor killings were perpetrated on those who deserved to die. He said that those who are killed have \\"loose morals\\" and are rightfully shot by relatives in honor killings. He did not vilify women alone but added that \\"If a woman runs around and if a man runs around with her, both of them are killed.\\". Associated Press. In 2007, a famous Norwegian Supreme Court advocate stated that he wanted the punishment for the killing from 17 years in prison to 15 years in the case of honor killings practiced in Norway. He explained that the Norwegian public did not understand other cultures who practiced honor killings, or understand their thinking, and that Norwegian culture \\"is self-righteous\\". In 2008, Israr Ullah Zehri, a Pakistani politician in Balochistan, defended the honor killings of five women belonging to the Umrani tribe by a relative of a local Umrani politician. Zehri defended the killings in Parliament and asked his fellow legislators not to make a fuss about the incident. He said, \\"These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.

Human rights advocates have compared \\"honor killings\\" to \\"crimes of passion\\" in Latin America (which are sometimes treated extremely leniently) and the killing of women for lack of dowry in India. Some commentators have stressed the point that the focus on honor killings should not lead people to ignore other forms of gender-based killings of women, in particular, those which occur in Latin America (\\"crimes of passion\\" and gang-related killings); the murder rate of women in this region is extremely high, with El Salvador being reported as the country with the highest rate of murders of women in the world. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that \\"crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable\\".

It was one of Shirley's most popular comedies, especially in the Restoration era. The play (which involves an actual maze in its final act) is almost universally known by its subtitle. History The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, 10 January, 1632. Unusually for a Shirley play of this period, Love in a Maze was acted by the King's Revels Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre, rather than the troupe for which Shirley normally wrote, Queen Henrietta's Men. The 1639 quarto was published by the bookseller William Cooke, and was dedicated to \\"the right honourable the Lady Dorothy Shirley,\\" the wife of Sir Robert Shirley, baronet. Shirley the dramatist may have been related to this prominent Shirley family of Warwickshire.Nason, pp. 8-10. The play was revived and performed often during the Restoration; Samuel Pepys saw it five times between May 1662 and April 1668, as recorded in his famous Diary.Wheatley p. 293. The comic actor John Lacy achieved a great popular success in the role of Johnny Thump. Love in a Maze was also performed at the Inns of Court in 1664, and John Dryden adapted material from the play for his The Maiden Queen (1668). Shirley's popular play influenced subsequent works by other writers of his era, including The Lovesick Court by Richard Brome and The Ladies' Privilege by Henry Glapthorne. Synopsis Gerard, a fashionable young gentleman about town, is in love with two sisters, Chrysolina and Aurelia, and is unable to choose between them. Compounding the difficulty, they both love him. (Mrs. Goldsworth, their mother, wants Aurelia to marry Sir Gervase Simple, a rich but clownish newly minted knight.) Gerard wants his friend Thornay to fall in love with one of the sisters himself, so that Gerard can then choose the other. The sisters, though, are not receptive to this arrangement, and dismiss both the young men. Eugenia is a former inamorata of Thornay. Eugenia's uncle wants her to marry Yongrave, who loves her; but Eugenia employs Yongrave to ask Thornay to return to her. Chrysolina learns of Thornay's abandonment of Eugenia and Yongrave's noble and chivalrous conduct in the matter; she falls in love with Yongrave as a result -- thus solving Gerard's original problem. Thornay returns to Eugenia, leaving Gerard with Aurelia. Sir Gervase Simple falls in love with and marries a Lady Bird, who turns out to be a boy page in disguise, put up for the prank by Caperwit the poetaster. Three contented couples and a wedding masque provide the appropriate ending for the comedy. The main plot is supported by a roster of comic figures, notably the previously-mentioned Sir Gervase Simple and Caperwit, and Johnny Thump, the servant of Sir Gervase.

Mythical sources claimed that the word Beltola comes from the word Bilvapatra, which means leaves of Bael tree, used in religious ceremonies. It was said that in olden day's large quantities of Bael tree leaves were sent to Kamakhya Temple to be used in rituals. It was from that time the place is called as Beltola.[1] It is an adjoining area of the Dispur Capital Complex, the capital of Assam. The area has seen rapid growth since the 1980s and its southern periphery is today extended up to the National Highway-27 (NH-27) in the extreme south of the city. It covers area of about 2.53 km¬≤ or 27,221,804.44 ft¬≤. Beltola Bazar in the central part of Beltola is a traditional bi-weekly fruits and vegetables market with historic importance. The market has been continuing since historic past and is an important traditional trading point between the people from the Khasi hills (Meghalaya) and the local people. It is a rich market with various types of local food products. Previously, Beltola was also the seat for a small protectorate of Ahom Kingdom, principally assisting administration of the Borphukan and in maintaining relations with the communities of Khasi Hills. The Rani or the Queen of Beltola is a popular historic figure in the locality. Beltola was in the news when on 24 November 2007 an Adivasi rally turned violent leading to arson and clashes.The Assam Tribune Largescale violence in city, curfew in Beltola, 25 November 2007. This led to further trouble in the rest of state. Situation leading to the violence in Beltola are unclear and may be manipulated. Third party involvement also cannot be denied. History During the Ahom reign, the kingdom of Beltola extends from the borders of the kingdom of Rani in the west, while in the east it extends to the borders of the kingdom of Mayong and Dimorua. The places named as Rajgarh and Hatigarh in present-day Guwahati city, were the borders between Ahom ruled Guwahati city and the kingdom of Beltola. After the fall of Ahom kingdom and the British occupation of Assam, Beltola lost its status as a kingdom and converted into a Mouza or revenue circle. Under British rule, the size of the Beltola Mouza was much reduced. Presently Beltola Mouza consists of several places of Modern day Guwahati city. Centrally located from Beltola haat or Beltola Bazaar, the Mouza or estate covers the area of Narengi, Birkuchi, Hengrabari, Panjabari, Hatigaon, Bhetapara, Maidam gaon, Rukminigaon, Khanapara, Kahilipara, Ganeshguri and Basistha Mandir. It was said that the Royal residence of the Beltola royal family was in Rukminigaon, while the place where the royal elephants were kept and trained was Hatigaon, literally meaning village of elephants (in Assamese Hati means elephant; gaon means village). Maidam gaon was said to be the place of cremation of the royal family members. The old name of Khanapara was Kainapara. Kaina is a Khasi word, which means elephant, while Para in Khasi language means human settlements or colony. It was said that the ruler of Beltola used to capture elephants and was indulge in the profitable business of selling elephants. It can be assumed that the Khasi people living in that region were indulged in the capturing elephants for the rulers of Beltola, due to which the name Kainapara or later Khanapara came into existence. Birkuchi name comes from the combination of two words, Bir means heroes and Kuchi means camp. It was said that the Koch army of Chilarai use to camp there for some time and thus the place got its name. Over time, Beltola has expanded as a residential area come commercial and educational hub with Beltola College as the institute offering graduate courses in Arts and Science. A sub-centre of the All Assam Students Union known as Beltola Students Union and is active in various activities. Landmark The Upcoming Project in Beltola is going to be not only icon of this locality but of whole Northeast India, the Twin Tower World Trade Center of 280 meters(918.635 feet) height with 65 floors including a cinema hall, a shopping mall, World Class Convention Centre (in association with World Trade Center site, New York), a State of the art Auditorium, Seminar halls and meeting rooms, food courts, open-air amphitheatre, Museum, Commercial Offices, Residential Apartments, Service Apartment, Sky Park at 200m height of 2acre area a Swimming Pool.

Beltola has a long history. It was, until about half a century ago, the hub of a small kingdom, the kingdom of Beltola. Close to the site of the famous \\"Beltola-haat\\", where small local vendors sell their agricultural produce and other goods of small-scale manufacturing twice a week, lived the royal family of the Beltola kings. Within living memory, there was a royal mansion/palace with the royal gardens. The Beltola-haat has been almost monumental for the inhabitants of greater Guwahati in that it has always been known to everyone here that the items that cannot be found in any other market in Guwahati, are likely to be sold here. Being located at a point convenient of access for vendors who came on foot and animal-transport from far-off places like present-day Meghalaya, this market retained its distinctive, indigenous character till about a decade ago before the high-rise apartment complexes were built. Even today this character is not entirely lost. Beltola Bazaar Today, Beltola Bazaar has become a daily market selling everything from clothes to vegetables. But, starting from Wednesday night to Thursday night and Saturday night to Sunday night from Vegetables to fruits, clothing, fast foods, home items, foot wear, women's apparel, toys, pastries all are available in Market ( Haat ). * History of Beltola * Ulubari * Paltan Bazaar * Ganeshguri * Chandmari * Maligaon * Bhetapara References Category:Neighbourhoods in Guwahati ","title":"Beltola"},{"id":"9438085","text":"Peter Burlingham Child (born 6 May 1953) is an American composer, teacher, and musical analyst.

It was originally published as two children's books, The Tarzan Twins by Voland in October 1927, and Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, by Whitman in March 1936. These were brought together in November 1963 under the title of Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins in the first complete edition. Cover of The Tarzan Twins (1927) Cover of Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion (1936) Despite the gap in when they were written and first published, the events of the two stories occur in the same time-frame. The opening passage of \\"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion\\" specifies that its events occur immediately after those of \\"The Tarzan Twins.\\" In relation to other Tarzan stories, the two parts of the Tarzan Twins tale presumably fall between Tarzan and the Ant Men and Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle chronologically, as the initial part was published between these two novels. The second part confirms their placement in approximately this period, as it introduces a family that figures prominently in Tarzan and the Lost Empire, the next book after Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle; specifically, it features Tarzan's first meeting with Doctor Karl von Harben, with whom he is already acquainted in Empire. Because Twins is a children's book, however, it is customarily omitted from listings of the main Tarzan series. Thus Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle is generally considered the eleventh Tarzan book rather than Twins. Plot Two schoolboys, Dick and Doc, are cousins who resemble each other because their mothers are twins. As Dick is also related to Tarzan through his father, they become known as the Tarzan Twins. Invited to visit Tarzan's African estate, they become lost in the jungle and are imprisoned by cannibals, from whom they escape. They are then reunited with their host, who introduces them to his pet lion, Jad-bal-ja. Subsequently, they become involved in an adventure involving exiles from the lost city of Opar, who have kidnapped Gretchen von Harben, the daughter of a missionary. Comic adaptations The book has been adapted into comic form by Gold Key Comics in Tarzan no. 196, dated April 1971, with a script by Gaylord DuBois and art by Mike Royer.

He is most renowned as a highly accomplished portraitist.  Career  From 1901 to 1909 Tilbergs studied under Dmitry Kardovsky in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire. Tilbergs graduated the Riga School of Art studying with Dimitriyev Kaukazska, then went on to complete his Master's degree at the St. Petersburg Art Academy in 1909, studying there with D. Kardovska, submitting as his masterwork \\"Piet√†\\".Samsons, V. et al. Latvijas PSR MazƒÅ Enciklopƒìdija (Concise Latvian S.S.R. Encyclopedia) 3rd ed. Vol. III. Riga, Latvia: Zinatne. 1970. His artwork appeared in publication already in 1904 in the journal Austrums where he illustrated A. Niedra's story Bads un Mƒ´lestƒ´ba (Hunger and Love), and he went on to illustrate a number of other books. He was the graphic designer for the satirical journal Svari,Latvijas Avƒ´ze website published in St. Petersburg and Riga; as well, he illustrated for the Russian journals Serij Volk and Novaja Rusj. Tilbergs helped organize and exhibited at the first Latvian art exhibition of 1910. Over his career, he exhibited at various international venues (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, France, England, et al.) as an ambassador of Latvian art and in one man shows in Riga (1934, 1960) and Tallinn (1961). The 1918 monument by Tilbergs to Taras Shevchenko in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) was the first monument dedicated to the great Ukrainian poet Following the 1917 Russian Revolution Tilbergs took part in Lenin's monumental propaganda program that called for the creation of the \\"Revolutionary monumental art\\", construction of the monuments to the revolutionaries and the \\"progressive artists of all times and nations\\". –ú–æ–Ω—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥–∞, Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Tilbergs' plaster monument to Taras Shevchenko (pictured), the greatest Ukrainian poet, artist and humanist, was dedicated on 1 December 1918. This first ever Shevchenko monument was not later replaced by the bronze version, as was originally planned, and was dismantled in eight years as the plaster deteriorated in open air. Tilbergs became a professor in the Latvian Academy of Arts in Riga where he taught a Figural Painting Master class in 1921‚Äì1932. He authored several designs of the coins minted in the interwar Latvia. The Latvian lats coins struck in 1924‚Äì1926 carried the palm branch design by Tilbergs, a motive popular in Europe at the time.Latvian Money , at the Bank of Latvia web-site . In academia Tilbergs was considered a master of the salon portrait and his portraits of Rainis (Janis Plieksans), a great Latvian writer, and Eduards Smiƒºƒ£is, a famous Latvian theatrical producer, are exhibited in the Latvian National Museum of Art. In Academy Tilbergs insisted on his students staying strictly within the academic canons of realism and was even considered despotic while his school was criticized for being too academic and lacking improvisation.Ruta Lapina, The Exhibition \\"Teachers of painting at the Latvian Academy of Art 1920‚Äì1940 In 1932 Tilbergs' class in Academia was taken over by Gederts Eliass. In 1936 he painted a new altar for the historic Sigulda church., Sigulda regional web-portal. Tilbergs return to the Academia in the post-World War II Soviet Latvia and remained a professor there from 1947 to 1957.  Recognition  Tilbergs was widely renowned in Soviet Latvia where he was accorded the title of the People's Artist of the Latvian SSR and decorated with the Soviet Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In modern Latvia he is recognised as one of the greatest national masters of the century. In 2005 the Latvian Post issued an item of postal stationery dedicated to Tilbergs' 125th birthday. 125th Anniversary of painter and graphic artist JƒÅnis Roberts Tilbergs, 2005  References  ;Inline ;General * –¢–∏–ª–±–µ—Ä–≥ –Ø–Ω–∏—Å in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia Category:1880 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Artists from Riga Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia Category:Latvian sculptors Category:Soviet painters Category:Soviet sculptors Category:20th-century sculptors Category:20th- century Latvian painters Category:20th-century Latvian artists ","title":"JƒÅnis Tilbergs"},{"id":"9438266","text":"The following is a complete list of creatures from the universe of ITV science fiction television series Primeval and also any spin-off media, including Primeval: New World (\\"PNW\\"). The series includes various imaginary species which are not native to the series setting, with some being prehistoric and others being futuristic. Various creatures were designed with some artistic license, for dramatic effect. A number of creatures from the Walking with... series were also reimagined for dramatic effect. A =Albertosaurus= Albertosaurus is a predatory theropod dinosaur, a member of the Tyrannosauridae. In Primeval: New World, an Albertosaurus killed and devoured Brooke, Evan Cross' wife and an alternate timeline version of Mac Rendall. In the series, its preorbital horns are greatly enlarged, similar to those of a Carnotaurus with similar skin textures. Evan encounters the same Albertosaurus as a hallucination after accidentally ingesting the snot of a Pachycephalosaurus. On close inspection, the Albertosaurus can be recognised by its missing right arm, and its body was covered in numerous old cuts and slashes. =Ammonite= Ammonites are a group of marine animals of the subclass Ammonoidea in the class Cephalopoda, phylum Mollusca. Ammonites' closest living relative is probably not the modern Nautilus (which they outwardly resemble), but rather the subclass Coleoidea (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish). Their fossil shells usually take the form of planispirals, although there were some helically spiralled and non-spiralled forms (known as \\"heteromorphs\\"). Many Ammonites lived in the open water of ancient seas, rather than at the sea bottom. Many of them are thought to have been good swimmers with flattened, discus-shaped, streamlined shells. Ammonites preyed on fish, crustaceans and other small creatures; while they themselves were preyed upon by marine reptiles. Helen Cutter leaves Ammonites as calling cards on Nick Cutter's desk, and on Stephen Hart's grave in episode 2.7. =Anatotitan= In Extinction Event, the first large dinosaurs the kidnapped team spot are Anatotitan, which are described as large hadrosaurs that move in large herds, stampeding whenever they are threatened by a predator such as the Tyrannosaurus. They were said to be a yellow-brown color with dark brown camouflage stripes down their back, similar to the Iguanodon in The Lost Island. =Ankylosaurus=  humans_killed = 1 In Extinction Event, Ankylosaurs are seen a couple of times, at first one plods harmlessly through the team's campsite, and prove to be resistant to gunfire, and later Jenny and the soldiers accompanying her are almost killed after an angered Ankylosaurus hits the car they are in with its tail club. A mother and baby are also seen in the Cretaceous. =Anurognathus= Anurognathus was a tiny pterosaur that had a short head with pin-like teeth for catching insects, and although it traditionally is ascribed to the long tailed pterosaur group, its tail was comparatively short, allowing it more manoeuvrability for hunting in woodland. Anurognathus lived in the Late Jurassic period, 130 million years ago and had a wingspan of and a long body (skull included), and it could not have weighed more than a few grams (although the pterosaurs that appear in episode 5.5 are considerably longer, fatter, and heavier, and could not have weighed so little). Despite this they prove to be creatures of devastating violence. Anurognathus live like a flying piranha fish, with an amazingly keen sense of smell able to detect blood from hundreds of feet away. A swarm can strip flesh from bones in minutes. They also swarm in huge flocks and overcome prey through weight in numbers. This fictional species of Anurognathus evolved from the Jurassic species Anurognathus ammoni which lived about 150 million years ago and had small needle like teeth for hunting insects. This evolved form has slicing teeth for taking lumps of flesh off large dinosaurs. This behaviour may be slightly based on the theory that a similar anurognathid pterosaur, Jeholopterus, was a hematophagous creature, like the modern vampire bat. The creatures seen in the series were re-imagined from the creatures in Walking with Dinosaurs by the producers for dramatic effect. In episode 5.5 a flock appears at the New Dawn power station. They attack Matt and Emily and later kill two Prospero guards. They later attack and kill April. What happened to them is unknown. =Arthropleura= Arthropleura was a long (about long in the series) relative of centipedes and millipedes, native to the Upper Carboniferous of Britain and the United States. It was the largest known land invertebrate of all time and grew so large because of the high percentage of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere at that time. A burrower, they have poor eyesight but have excellent sense of smell and touch. One appears in the second episode. Although not a carnivore, they have powerful pincers and venomous bite and can easily be provoked into attacking. For dramatic effect, the Arthropleura in episode 1.2 was heavily re-imagined as it was venomous, larger than the real animal and highly aggressive. Symptoms of the Arthropleura poisoning include uncontrolled shaking, anaphylaxis and short term memory loss in recovered patients. Once bitten the venom then begins to slowly attack the central nervous system, not so far removed from modern biochemistry as to be totally ineffective, and any enzyme inhibitor would be detrimental to an extent. However, as the Arthropleura are detritus eaters they make no attempt to eat their victims. Fortunately the hospital staff discovered that the venom has a modern-day equivalent, thus producing an anti- venom. An Arthropleura also reappeared in the series finale of Series 2 as one of the many creatures captured by Leek. When the security system holding it failed, it ran amok, although how it had survived thus far without the carboniferous atmosphere that it needed to live, remains a mystery. Arthropleura also featured in the advertising campaign for the series, appearing in The London Paper on 16 February 2007. The Arthropleura portrayed here is different from the creatures seen in the fossil record, in addition to the Arthropleura in Walking with Monsters as well as in Prehistoric Park, re- imagined by the producers to make it scarier. =Australopithecus= Australopithecus are believed to be the ancestors of modern-day humans. Helen Cutter believed the only way to stop the destruction of life on earth was to stop humans from evolving, so she attempted to wipe out our ancestors. She began by poisoning the members of the \\"First Family\\" in episode 3.10, but is killed herself before she can complete her plan. Danny Quinn later found several more living in the Rift Valley as he attempted to find his way back to the anomaly. B =Badger-like mammal= In The Lost Island, the team are marooned in the Cretaceous, when they run into a mammal described as being similar to a badger. It briefly snarls at the team, and then runs off. It turns out to have been later feasting on a dead Iguanodon calf. = Brontoscorpio = Brontoscorpio body is approximately eight feet long, and it can scale on walls and other surfaces like a spider. The body is covered in a hard exoskeleton, the only soft spot it has is its mouth. The exoskeleton makes tasers ineffective against Brontoscorpio, and even when shot directly into its mouth, tasers sometimes have little effect on Brontoscorpio (but, other times, can knock it out for a few moments). Brontoscorpio is known to attack victims with its stinger to incapacitate them with its venom, and to suck out and consume its victims' internal organs after its venom kills them. Brontoscorpio also lives in burrows. Brontoscorpio has also been shown to approach prey tensed and cautiously and to momentarily back away slightly when the victim shows signs of attacking, similar to some modern day scorpions. =Burrowing insect= This creature is from the future, and has been encountered by Matt Anderson before, allowing him knowledge of their behaviour. Adults are in length. They have armoured shells, however their underbelly is softer. Their anomaly must have opened some years before and they had dug tunnels stretching all across London. In episode 5.1, one attacked a roadworker who fell into one of its tunnels, and returned when Matt, Becker and Abby arrived, attempting to attack them as they fired their EMDs, which did not affect it. It then attacked a man at a barbecue, which alerted the team who tried to use lethal weapons to bring it down, only for the creature to drag Connor into its tunnel. As the team located its nest, it succumbed to the damage done to it and died, leaving Connor to find dozens more inside the building. Connor filled the building with gas and escaped with Matt as the building was blown up in order to exterminate them. C =Camouflage Beast= In episode 3.2, the Camouflage Beast (it is never given a name on screen) is the major, and only, creature. It has been shown on the ITV website that this creature is based heavily on the Madagascan aye-aye which is seen as a symbol of death in its homeland. The creature may speak some kind of language, as it makes a kind of hissing, whispering noise when it is alone. It was responsible for the disappearance of two boys 14 years before the present, including Patrick Quinn, and leaving Ryan Mason the only survivor. In the present day it was being fed raw meat by a girl in order to keep it from eating neighbouring pets. When the team arrived at the now abandoned house they could not find the creature due to its camouflage ability, and later it attacked Abby when she was alone. Abby later followed it and discovered the girl feeding it. She and Ryan were in the house when it attacked again, however when the others arrived it killed a real estate agent. It attacked Danny Quinn, and it went through its anomaly when it reopened, however it came back, only to be shot several times by Danny as it fell back through, possibly dead. In episode 4.7 Patrick Quinn, who in fact survived and went through the anomaly, stated that the Camouflage beasts kept coming for him and was forced to kill them to survive. The trauma caused him to also see humans as animals, and became convinced that killing humans is not any different from killing animals. =Coelurosauravus= A male Coelurosauravus, named \\"Rex\\", entered the present in the series' premiere, and despite attempts to send it back to the Permian, was adopted by Abby and quickly became a mascot for the team. Coelurosauravus is incorrectly shown to be capable of powered flight rather than simple gliding, and shown to be far larger than its real size of . Its head crest is also entirely speculative. In episode 1.1, Rex was kept by Ben Trent after he came through the Permian anomaly, and was assumed to be the flying lizard Draco volans until Abby Maitland arrived and said he wasn't. After encountering a Scutosaurus and a group of others, Rex was taken to the Home Office to be examined. He escaped from the lab and flew around the building, and Abby kept him from leaving. He was returned through the Permian anomaly by Nick Cutter, but came back to the present and was taken back to Abby's flat in secret. Abby had to adjust the temperature of her flat so that it was similar to his own environment, and Connor Temple discovered him, but agreed to not reveal Rex's presence. Rex escaped from the flat in episode 1.5, and was accidentally transported to a golf course where Connor tried to catch him. Rex ran off as they were attacked by a Pteranodon, and Abby pleaded to Cutter to let her keep him. Rex was later found and returned to the flat. In episode 2.2, Rex took an instant dislike to Connor's new girlfriend Caroline Steel, attempting to bite her. In episode 2.4 he was left in the freezer by Caroline, and was found by Abby before he completely froze. By the next day he had recovered. In episode 2.5 Caroline attempted to capture Rex by leaving food out for him, and he flew around the flat trying to avoid her but was knocked down by a tennis racket. Caroline took Rex to Oliver Leek, who kept him in his creature prison. In episode 2.7 he was released along with the other creatures, and found a shaft to the surface which was used by the team to escape. Rex was shot by a guard, and Caroline asked to redeem herself by getting Rex out. Rex was shown to still be living with Abby and Connor in episode 3.1, and in episode 3.6 Abby's brother Jack bet Rex during a game of poker with a friend and lost. He was put on E-Bay for sale which allowed Connor to notice what Jack had done. They attempted to get Rex back, and finally did so when Connor had Captain Becker threaten the seller. Abby brought Rex over to James Lester's flat where Connor was staying in episode 3.9, and Rex played with Connor's two Diictodon, Sid and Nancy. During Abby and Connor's disappearance, Rex was relocated to the new ARC inside the menagerie, living alongside other creatures that hadn't been returned to their own eras, such as the Columbian Mammoth and the Dracorex. Abby reunited with Rex in episode 4.2 after she had returned and been placed in charge of the creatures. In episode 4.3 Rex escaped from the menagerie and caused the ARC to go into lockdown when he was scanned by Phillip Burton's bio-scanner. The room was drained of oxygen, and Connor managed to cancel the lockdown in time to be able to resuscitate Rex. In episode 5.4 he was in Abby's lab when the ARC was invaded by Future Beetles and flew around the ARC. Abby searched for him to rescue him before a gamma ray was released, and later returned to the menagerie. =Columbian mammoth= The Columbian mammoth was one of the largest of the mammoth species and also one of the largest elephants to have ever lived, measuring , at the shoulder and weighing with tusks long. It was a herbivore, with a diet consisting of varied plant life ranging from grasses to conifers. It has been estimated that a large male would have eaten approximately , of plant material daily. The remains of Columbian mammoths were discovered in the La Brea Tar Pits in California and this mammoth also lived in Mexico, where its remains are very common. It was one of the last members of the Megafauna to become extinct, with several specimens dating only about 7,800 years ago. The mammoth appears in series two holding up traffic on the M25 motorway. As it desperately tries to make its way to the nearby trees, it completely destroys all the nearby cars. Using female elephant urine, the team manage to lead it into a lorry trailer and trap it, taking it back to the ARC where it was kept in a large garage. After being chased through the ARC by a Future Predator, Lester releases the mammoth which impales the predator on its tusks. Lester then jokes that his children have been wanting him to get a pet. The mammoth was seen in the new ARC's menagerie in episode 4.2 and episode 4.4. When Philip Burton decided to have the creatures put down, Abby decided to relocate the creatures, including the mammoth, but was unable to do so. However Lester managed to blackmail Philip into forgetting the whole thing, and Lester told Abby that he thought it would have rude not to have saved the mammoth's life after it had saved him. In episode 5.5, the anomaly on the M25 reopened and another mammoth (and possibly more) came through it. =Crested bird= In Extinction Event, in an area where live specimens of Cretaceous life forms have been collected, Cutter stops to look at a tiny crested bird in a wire cage that was captured by the Russian team. One of the men describes how rare this actually is, as tiny-boned creatures rarely remain intact in fossilisation. D =Daemonosaurus= '' In Clean Up on Aisle Three, a pack of Daemonosaurus came through an anomaly into a tire store, where they killed a security guard,, dragging him back through the anomaly, after declaring the store as their territory. In the end, the Special Projects Group is able to capture the alpha and send it back through the anomaly, the rest follow the alpha back through the anomaly, never gonna return ever again if the anomaly ever opens, now that they recognize the store as the Special Projects Group's territory. =Deinosuchus= In Fire and Water, Deinosuchus are described as \\"giant crocodiles\\" reaching up to 15 m (50 feet) in length, and that females were more dominant than males. Connor Temple and Abby Maitland lure the Deinosuchus using aerosols while Captain Becker and his men dart it with tranquillisers. They never do get them back to the past and remain in Oliver Leek's old bunker where he kept all his army of creatures. =Devonian Slime Shooter= Helen Cutter was slimed by an unknown creature during a visit to the Devonian period, forcing her to travel to the present in Stephen's flat to have the slime washed off. =Didelphodon= In Extinction Event, a single Didelphodon is captured by the Russian anomaly team, and taken to a building in their camp where live specimens are taken. It is described as a hairy badger-like marsupial and is also an insectivore, as it is described crunching on live locusts. =Diictodon= Diictodon are small burrowing synapsids (proto-mammals). A group of over fifteen individuals appear to be traversing air vents in a hospital, chewing through the electrical cables that the team will need to remove them. Abby catches one which sends of a distress signal calling them all back through the anomaly but one drops from the roof (Sid) and lands inside a trolley Connor is pushing. A single Diictodon tried to escape through an anomaly, which disappears. It later becomes apparent that Abby and Connor adopt two to keep Rex company. In episode 3.5, they are named Sid and Nancy and are living with Connor while Abby's brother, Jack, is staying. When Connor was staying with James Lester the two caused him much grief. =Dimetrodon= In Extinction Event, Dimetrodon are encountered by Helen Cutter, Jenny Lewis and the group of men assigned to help them. They are described as being as big as alligators, basking in groups like iguanas or sea lions and also have a crippling amount of bacteria in their mouth, similar to a Komodo dragon. The group of Dimetrodon are disturbed by the team and one man is badly bitten. He never recovers from the ensuing infection, but is later killed in the Cretaceous period by a pack of Troodon. =Dodo= Dodos are flightless birds from the late Holocene. The dodo was found only on the islands of Mauritius. Related to pigeons and doves, they stand about tall, weighing about . Dodos have greyish plumage, a bill with a hooked point, very small wings, stout yellow legs, and a tuft of curly feathers on its rear end. The sternum is insufficient to support flight; these ground-bound birds evolved to take advantage of an island ecosystem with no predators. They live on fallen fruit and in the Primeval Universe they exist in a symbiotic relationship with the Ambalacoque tree. The name came from the Portuguese word doudo or doido, itself a loanword from Old English (cf. English \\"dolt\\"). The name was given because the dodo apparently never tried to run or escape when hunted ‚Äì hence, they were traditionally regarded as stupid. The species was hunted to extinction by the late 17th century, shortly after the first arrival of people on the dodo's native Mauritius. They were the main focus in episode 1.4. Nick Cutter quickly realises they are just friendly and trusting, never having to deal with predators before. In reality they were as intelligent as any other bird. The dodos are themselves harmless, but some carry deadly parasites. =Dracorex= Dracorex is a Cretaceous dinosaur. A promotional picture for that episode shows that it has sharp teeth, which is unlikely for a probably herbivorous creature, and two, small, wing-like sails on its back in the manner of Amargasaurus. The picture shows a very long but not forked tongue. The dinosaur also has grasping talons on its hind legs, shown in the image lashing out at the knight. The Dracorex in the series also strongly resembles the mountain dragon from the Animal Planet documentary The Last Dragon. A female appears in episode 3.7, having lived in Medieval times before being chased through an anomaly to the present by a knight who assumed it to be a dragon. The Dracorex had been injured after having a lance driven into its side, and Abby and Becker cornered it in a strawberry patch where it collapsed of its own accord. Abby removed the stake with Becker and cared for it with Connor Temple as she helped to patch it up. It was later moved to the ARC. It escaped from the new ARC's menagerie in episode 4.1 due to an error caused by Jess Parker. It knocked Matt Anderson down in a corridor before it arrived in the hub where Jess was. Becker and soldiers arrived to contain it, but it was led into Lester's office by Matt, who left it some water. Some time later Becker tranquilised it and it was moved back to the menagerie. E =Embolotherium= The Embolotherium are a type of brontothere. Superficially they looked much like rhinos, although they were actually more closely related to horses. They have large but brittle horns which, in the series, are used for display during mating seasons. These beasts able to scare off big predators like Andrewsarchus. The males have a heart shaped horn on top of their noses which is about and the females have a some sort of stump. A herd of Embolotherium appeared from an anomaly and caused damage in a campsite. There is one male and several females, accompanied by a baby. The male killed a quad-bike rider after he disturbed the infant. The females were gathered around a tent, trapping another man, and Connor distracted the male by having it chase him in a go-cart. The baby was also trapped inside the tent, so Abby and Sarah saved it after making their way through the herd. Later the team attempted to force them through the anomaly, only for it to close as Connor led the bull to the females and caused them all to stampede. They charged towards the campsite, however Eve managed to open an anomaly to send them all back through. =Entelodon= In Extinction Event, a pair of Entelodon come through an anomaly from the Cenozoic onto Oxford Street, killing three people and damaging cars and buses, as well as chasing Connor, Abby and Jenny at different stages in the chapter. One is brought down by Cutter's tranquilliser darts and the other is killed by Hemple, the team's artillery expert for the book. =Eotyrannus= In The Lost Island, the team face a near-constant threat on the island, due to the attacks of a large pack of Eotyrannus, a tyrannosauroid dinosaur about 4 metres long. The creatures kill several people, then die in a storm. =Euparkeria= In Extinction Event, a small anomaly opens in a service station along a dual carriageway, and lets through several Euparkeria, which are described as small quadrupedal animals that run on their hind legs when frightened. Because the anomaly site is closed off for the chapter involving the Archosaurs, no members of the public are attacked, but Abby is bitten through a gauntlet by one. The Euparkeria are all rounded up and released through the anomaly before it closes. =Eustreptospondylus= Eustreptospondylus was the largest carnivorous dinosaur in Europe during the Jurassic Period, 150-145 mya. The ARC team encounters one that has come through an anomaly into a South African safari park. It is brought into thei park, and is first seen disembowelling a rancher. Later, while attacking Danny Quinn, James Lester and Sophie, who were investigating the disappearances, a pride of lions distract and injure it. The creature escapes, followed by the lions; two of whom will be killed. It is then identified by Connor Temple, who was dealing with Velociraptors and giant crocodilians, and observed attacking hippos; it bites one but the hippo does not sustain much damage. The Eustreptospondylus then attacks the team once more, but a Postosuchus interferes and battles the dinosaur, killing it. The remains of the theropod are found later. F =Future Beetle= A species of carnivorous beetle from the future resembling the scarab beetle, that move around in enormous swarms led by a huge Queen. Their mandibles are so strong they can chew through concrete. They appear via an anomaly opened by Connor, kill a guard and cause chaos throughout the ARC going through the vents and piping. Becker shot some of the swarm with an EMD, including the Queen, and others were killed with pesticide. Their venom is not extremely poisonous, but one beetle bit Jess, who went into anaphylaxis. Matt and Connor rigged the anomaly creator to explode in a gamma ray burst to kill the remaining beetles. =Future Bird= In Shadow of the Jaguar, a creature from the future, theorised to be a future evolution of predatory birds by Cutter, is found controlling a pack of Thylacosmilus with pheromones. It has a certain resemblance to the Incan god, Pacha Kamaq. The team track it down to its lair in the ruins of an Incan temple in the Peruvian jungle. After they disrupt its control over the Thylacosmilus, the creature retreats through the anomaly with them seconds before it closes. Cutter later theorises to Lester the creature may have been seen later in history by the Incas and incorporated into their mythology. The creature had several unusual abilities, such as the ability to control other creatures through the use of pheromones (like a queen bee controls a beehive), and a tongue with a tip covered in many tiny teeth that can burrow into flesh. =Future Fungus= The Future Fungus is parasitic, extremely aggressive and eats through the flesh of anything that touches it. As soon as someone touches it, it instantly begins converting them into a shell that is loosely human shaped, but has lost all human features and intelligence, relying on instinct. In other words, the fungus effectively kills the host once it has transformed. The ARC team thought that heating the creatures would kill them, but it only advanced their reproduction. In the end, freezing them was the solution. The fungus creature's life cycle is as follows: *Spores are inhaled into the host's lungs. *The spores become moist and convert into fungus *Once consumed the fungus shell turns into a fungus creature which spread the fungus by touch. *The fungus creature finally roots itself into the ground and waits to spread spores to new hosts. The fungus is probably the evolved form of the contemporary Cordyceps fungus of south-east Asia for its lifecycle bears a strong resemblance to the fungus. Cordyceps grows inside a host (usually an ant), replacing the surrounding tissue with its own, avoiding the vital organs. It then alters the host's behaviour to make it go to an area of suitable conditions. Cordyceps then grows throughout the host's body, killing it, before becoming completely rooted in the ground or stem the host found itself on. Cordyceps then sporulates, infecting more hosts, by either inhaling the spores through the windpipe or spores falling through pores in the exoskleteton or skin. The Cordyceps fungus probably evolved into the future fungus to attack bigger prey, such as the Megopteran. The fungus was found by Sir Richard Bentley's assistant after he went through an anomaly in a flat, and accidentally transferred it to the present where Bentley was infected by it. As he slowly took over him, a sample of Connor's at the ARC affected another man, and more quickly turned him into a Fungus Creature. Connor and Sarah's belief that overheating it would kill it was thought to have worked only to learn it actually spread the spores even more, leading the flamethrower-wielding team to capture it instead. After freezing the fungus instead, they found it worked and prepared the ARC to freeze their captured creature, only for it to escape and attack Jenny before it succumbed to the cold. =Future Predator= Vicious creatures referred to as \\"Future Predators\\" are Primeval's most recurring creatures, besides Rex. They are descendants of bats, and like bats use echolocation to hunt and locate prey, with the ears having moved to the front of the face. They are extremely agile, but this comes at a cost, as they are easily stunned by powerful blows. The Future Predators are known to have caused the most deaths out of any creature in the series, both on-screen deaths, and total (if what Helen Cutter said about them wiping out humanity in the future was true). TV critic Walt Belcher of the Tampa Tribune described the Future Predator as \\"an apelike and skull- headed thing that sort of represents the ultimate dumbing down of the human race\\"WALT BELCHER. (7 August 2008). Time Portal Drama In London Rips Open A Whole Batch Of Zoological Adventures. Tampa Tribune,2. Retrieved 29 October 2010, from ProQuest Newsstand. (Document ID: 1529629631). Their first appearance is in episode 1.6. A mating pair lived in the Permian era after going through an anomaly, and Helen realised they were from the future. When an anomaly led to the present they went through, and proceeded to kill a lion and four innocent people, including Abby Maitland's boss. Helen, believing there was only one, warned the team about it, and they failed in their attempt to kill it initially. Connor Temple came up with an idea to track its echolocation, but was attacked in a car before he was saved by Abby and Stephen Hart. Nick Cutter led the team to its lair, where they discovered it had given birth to five infants before they were attacked by the male. Nick managed to kill him, and he and Helen planned to use the infants to locate the future anomaly in the Permian to try prevent more from going through into that era. However the female Future Predator followed and attacked them, killing Tom Ryan and his men before a Gorgonopsid arrived and knocked her down. Three of the infants were killed before the mother fought back, and though she managed to inflict heavy wounds on the Gorgonopsid she was crushed and killed. Nick and Helen unknowingly left the remaining two infants in the Permian, which changed the future for Cutter & Helen, eliminating Claudia Brown from the history of everyone who hadn't gone through the anomaly. In episode 2.6, Oliver Leek had control of a Future Predator using a \\"neural clamp\\", which he had taken to the ARC and kill some of the staff discreetly before going after James Lester. Lester made several attempts to fight back, turning on Connor's iPod speakers on loud and using a machinegun from the armoury before being cornered in the main room. Leek had the Future Predator leap to deliver the final blow, only for it to become impaled on the tusk of a Columbian Mammoth that Lester had just let loose. In episode 2.7 it is revealed Leek has successfully captured a pack of Future Predators, and using neural clamps to maintain control over them, referring to them as his \\"Praetorian Guard\\". Cutter was pursued by one through the facility until he managed to draw it in close with his blood before ripping the neural clamp from its head, killing it. Leek threatened to use the rest of his controlled Future Predators to tear Cutter apart, however Cutter freed them of their mind control devices by forcing the one he had into a fuse box, disabling the rest. They then turned on Leek and killed him before they were locked in a feeding chamber along with all of the other creatures that Leek, Helen and their soldiers had locked kept. They were among the creatures that killed Stephen as he sacrificed himself to keep the creatures locked up to have them kill one another. In episode 3.1, Future Predators appear in their own environment in an old city. They were the inadvertent guards for a mysterious artefact. Soldiers sent by Christine Johnson to recover the artefact killed a young Future Predator before an adult kills all but one of the soldiers. In episode 3.4, Christine was shown to have been operating on one in an attempt to learn how to recreate its echolocation. It woke up, and Christine had it killed. In episode 3.8, a pack of Future Predators stalked the team when they arrived in the future. Captain Becker killed one while accidentally alerting several others to their presence due to the noise from his gun. An infant leaped out of a car to attack Danny Quinn, scarring his neck before he stomped on it. More approached as the team were rescuing Jack Maitland, and Becker led them away. The team were trapped in an abandoned bus by the Future Predators before several Megopterans arrived and the two species fought amongst themselves, and the still alive Becker killed another as it came towards the team. In episode 3.9, a Future Predator kills Christine after she was pushed through an anomaly leading to the future by Helen. In episode 3.10 one stalked Danny, Connor and Abby as they searched for Helen, but was locked away from them. It soon broke into the room along with several others, narrowly missing their quarry as they escaped into the Cretaceous through an anomaly which was closed to prevent them following. In episode 5.6, the Future Predators are shown differently, having evolved to survive in the harsh landscape caused by Philip Burton. They are much quicker than before, have more sun-damaged skin, and with food so scarce they attack each other to claim prey for themselves. One prepared to attack Connor before a storm came up, and it fought with another before the victor was brought down by Abby. A group attacked as Connor, Abby and Matt Anderson made their way back to the anomaly, though they fought amongst themselves. A pair went through an anomaly created by Connor into the ARC, and attacked Lester and Jess Parker. They severely injured Lester, and when the team arrived Abby came up with a plan to paralyse them by using ultra-sonic noise. The first had Abby pinned before Becker killed it with his EMD, and the other froze as Abby initiated her plan, and Becker was able to use his EMD to kill it with only a few close range blows. The \\"Future Predators\\" also appear on the Watch YouTube Game. They attack your computer screen and it takes three hits to kill them. =Future Shark= The Future Shark is the future evolution of a modern-day shark. It looks similar to some deep-sea sharks, but has a special adaptation: a very long tongue armed with spikes that can be fired from the jaw like a harpoon. Modern day sharks such as the tiger shark have been found with litter in their stomachs, including plastic bags, tins and car registration plates: the basketball and the shoe found in the Future Shark's stomach could be a reference to this. In episode 2.4 this creature prepared to attack Jenny Lewis in the water before it was shot by Stephen Hart and then captured by the team who suspected it of killing a boy. After examining the creature in their ARC, Nick Cutter concluded it was probably the descendant of the shark. Since no remains of the boy were found in the creature's stomach, and sharks typically take days to digest their prey, it did not kill the missing boy. =Future Maggot= A future maggot attacks Jack Maitland in the underground in the future. It is not clear if the worms are larvae of the Megopteran or if they are a completely different species. They probably are not the larvae of the Megopteran as its young were seen in the present not long after they came out of a dead human body and are miniature versions of the adult animal. G =Giant spider= The giant spiders are, despite appearances, not true spiders (order Araneae), but a species of Solifugae, a distinct arachnid order. The name derives from Latin, and means those that flee from the sun. The adults are up to wide, by 1 m long, because the lush rainforest of the Carboniferous saturates the atmosphere with oxygen, allowing them to grow larger than modern arthropods. They have pincers instead of fangs ‚Äì like the modern day camel spider, only much bigger. They also have long pedipalps, which function as sense organs similar to insects' antennae and give the appearance of the two extra legs. Pedipalps terminate in reversible adhesive organs. They do not appear to make webs or produce venom but they nest in large groups and are very defensive of their offspring. A nest of them appears in the second episode. Ryan and the other special forces enter the tunnel, and they are attacked by a whole group of them, killing one of the soldiers. They find out that the spiders did not kill the pest controller, because the bite looked different. It would be found out that they avoid light, and by using torches, all the giant spiders are driven back through the anomaly by the end of episode 1.2. These creatures are based on fragmentary fossils which scientists thought was a 1 m wide spider but this has just recently been reclassified as a type of scorpion. The giant spiders also featured in the advertising campaign for the show, first on giant billboards on 1 February 2007 and again in The London Paper on 16 February 2007. =Giganotosaurus= Giganotosaurus is one of the largest species of carnivorous dinosaurs. It is shown to be able to run at high speed for a surprisingly long distance, considering its huge size and weight. It is dubbed a \\"G-Rex\\" by the characters throughout the episode because it is pictured just like a T-Rex just slightly bigger. In episode 3.4, one appears at an airport and starts attacking a news crew investigating the anomaly. It ate Nigel Marven, then went back through before it returned and ran out onto the runway, attacking an aeroplane. Connor Temple lured it away with a luggage carrier before it tripped over the small vehicle and pinned Connor down on the runway. Then a helicopter piloted by Danny Quinn lured it back through the anomaly. Danny came back in time to reveal that there was a large pack on the other side of the anomaly, and Connor only just manages to lock the anomaly in time. =Gorgonopsid= A Gorgonopsid was first seen chasing Helen through a car parking lot after travelling to the present through an Anomaly in the Forest of Dean, and chased her through the Anomaly in question. Eight years later, the same Anomaly re-opened and a Gorgonopsid came through once again; it was eventually shot and killed by Stephen. In a later episode, after Nick and Helen went through the same Anomaly after it re-opened and were attacked by a Future Predator that had followed them, a Gorgonopsid showed up and, after killing and devouring most of the Predator's babies, had a brutal fight with the adult Predator, emerging victorious after crushing it to death. H =Hesperornis= Hesperornis is an extinct genus of flightless aquatic birds that lived during the Late Cretaceous. Hesperornis were fairly large birds, reaching up to in length. They had virtually no wings, swimming with powerful hind legs. Their toes were probably lobed rather than being webbed, as in today's grebes; like in these, the toes could rotate well, which is necessary to decrease drag in lobed feet but not in webbed ones such as in loons, where the toes are simply folded together. Like many other Mesozoic birds such as Ichthyornis, Hesperornis had teeth in its beak which were used to hold prey (most likely fish). In the hesperornithiform lineage they were of a different arrangement than in any other known bird (or in non-avian theropod dinosaurs), with the teeth sitting in a longitudinal groove rather than in individual sockets. They hunted in the waters of the North American Inland Sea which then were tropical waters, much warmer than today. They probably fed mainly on fish, their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey. Later as Nick Cutter swims through the anomaly he finds himself in a tropical sea with a flock of Hesperornis swimming around him. He later finds a Hesperornis rookery amongst the rocky shoreline. Two Hesperornis investigate, but Helen Cutter shoos them off by throwing small stones, and says that they \\"tend to be more dumb than violent, only attacking when they're in a panic or disturbed.\\" Hesperornis is shown as being covered in scales when in real life, Hesperornis was likely covered in feathers. Also they were not able to stand upright or walk as the legs attached far at the back and sideways, with even the lower leg being tightly attached to the body. Thus, they were limited to sliding on their belly or galumphing. =Hyaenodon= Hyaenodon is an extinct genus of Hyaenodonts, a group of carnivorous creodonts of the family Hyaenodontidae. Some species of this genus were amongst the largest terrestrial carnivorous mammals of their time, others were only of the size of a marten. They had very massive skulls but only small brains. It had a long skull with a narrow snout ‚Äì much larger in relation to the length of the skull than in canine carnivores, for instance. Its neck was shorter than its skull, while its body was long and robust and terminated in a long tail. Despite the name, these creatures are not related to hyenas. A total of two adults and three cub Hyaenodons came through an anomaly in the wine cellar of a stately mansion, where Jenny Lewis is getting married, in episode 4.6, making a den. An adult killed a wedding planner in the cellar where the pups were. Connor stunned one male Hyaenodon and it was sent back through the anomaly. He was trapped in the cellar because of the female, and gave some wine to two cubs to knock them out and returned them to the anomaly before trying to get the third through as well, only to allow the male back through. The two adults attacked the wedding party and were fought off with medieval weapons. All the Hyaenodons were returned. I =Iguanodon= The Iguanodon is first encountered in The Lost Island as a juvenile, which has fallen down a hill and broken its leg. Cutter shoots it to put it out of its misery. Later, when marooned in the past, the team witness hundreds of Iguanodon moving on a plain below, being attacked by Neovenator and associating with Polacanthus. Matt Anderson mentions handling a herd of them that had found their way into a beauty pageant during his first mission as team leader at the end of Series 4 webisode 5. J =Jurassic beetle= Jurassic beetles were a species of beetle from the Jurassic. They are carnivorous, eusocial creatures that use live animals as incubators for their eggs. Jurassic beetles are black or grey beetles, and are carnivorous. Workers and drones are approximately the same size as modern day beetles, while queens are around eight feet in length, with extremely hard and armoured carapaces and large wings which allow them flight. The beetles have very small, almost invisible eyes, due to which they have poor eyesight and avoid fire and bright light, and for that fact they have long antennae to compensate. It is known that drone and worker Jurassic beetles generally attack prey in massive swarms to overwhelm and devour it in seconds. It is also known that a queen beetle breeds by capturing a live victim and depositing at least one sac of gelatinous eggs from its mouth down into the captured host's throat. The Jurassic beetle drones are similar to the future beetles, and the queen Jurassic beetle is similar to the Megopteran and the more over the queen future beetle. K =Kaprosuchus= Kaprosuchus is known by only a single skull, discovered by the palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 2009. The prehistoric crocodile had oversized tusks embedded toward the front of its upper and lower jaws, inspiring Sereno's affectionate nickname, the BoarCroc. Like many crocodiles of the Cretaceous period, Kaprosuchus was not restricted to river ecosystems; judged by its long legs and impressive dentition, this four-legged reptile roamed the plains of Africa much in the style of a big cat. In fact, with its big tusks, powerful jaws and span, Kaprosuchus may have been capable of taking down comparably sized herbivorous (or even carnivorous) dinosaurs. A Kaprosuchus appeared in episode 4.2, having grown from a hatchling flushed into the sewer 5 years previously into an adult preying on the homeless living by the Thames. Its presence was discovered by Connor, Abby and Duncan, who alerted the ARC with Matt after he saved them from its initial attack when its home was set on fire by construction workers. Though it was brought down by an EMD and contained, it woke up and escaped, chasing Duncan into a maze of containers, killing a soldier. After forcing it out of a maze of containers, the team inadvertently killed it with EMDs since the firepower was too much for it. Another appears in Episode 5.5, coming through a new anomaly during the anomaly convergence, and attacking Connor and Philip's car. Philip left Connor on his own, and Connor called Abby for help, who arrived and brought it down with an EMD while driving. Whether or not it survived and was returned, or whether it was killed is unknown. The Kaprosuchus also appears on the Watch YouTube Game. It would take two hits to kill the Kaprosuchus. L =Labyrinthodont= A large labyrinthodont with a very long tail, and a juvenile, appeared in a seaside cave in episode 4.5.Primeval creatures -Labyrinthodont The adult had been causing many people and animal stock to go missing over the ten years since the anomaly had previously been open. It killed someone camping out to investigate the 'Witchfield Worm', and Matt Anderson saved a fisherman from been devoured too. Abby Maitland pursued the creature to a campsite where she lured it on top of a caravan and drove it part way to the anomaly site. Connor Temple discovered the infant in the cave, and its cries of pain caused by acid drew the adult back. It killed two people, one of whom had known about the creature and attempted to contain it, before being driven back through the anomaly by Connor and Abby. =Liopleurodon= Liopleurodon are a species of Pliosaur, an extinct type of marine reptile. In The Lost Island novel, a Liopleurodon sinks a trawler boat in the Atlantic south of Ireland, at Guns Island, and is later encountered by the team in the water. It seems heavily resistant to bullets, but when the team discover it, it is dying from the cold of the Atlantic winter. In episode 5.2 a Liopleurodon comes through an anomaly in the North Sea, and attacks and disables a naval submarine. The submarine is drawn through the anomaly to the Jurassic and the Liopleurodon follows it back. A pod of them swim around the submarine, banging it to see if it is food. When a swimming theropod is ejected from the vessel, all of the creatures go after the decoy, and one of the Liopleurodons eats it. =Lycaenops= In the episode \\"Undone\\", the Cross Photonics predator control team captures a female who is stalking students at a college library. The female pees on Mac, attracting a male Lycaenops to follow them back to the headquarters. While the team chase after the male that followed the female on campus, she kills Mac's girlfriend, Sam, as well as another Cross Photonics guard named Bill. The female Lycaenops is then shot by Dylan after a chase, and as the male arrives to mourn her death, he is shot by Mac to avenge his girlfriend. M =Meganeura= Meganeura was a large dragonfly from the Carboniferous period. One was captured by Project Magnet and was kept in a glass box in their laboratory, apparently dead. =Megopteran= ITV launched a competition for a viewer to design a creature, which was judged by the creators and will appear in Series 3. The winner was 16-year-old Carim Nahaboo from Essex,CultPrimevalSeries 3Winner revealed ‚Äì ITV Drama whose creature is a large predatory insect from the future which, as Carim described, \\"evolved from carnivorous beetles, such as the tiger beetle\\".CultPrimevalSeries 3Competition ‚Äì ITV Drama However, the series described it as evolving from either wasps or ants. The creature can fly and run fast over long distances, and lives in future jungles. It is known as Megopteran. In episode 3.8 a group of them are gassed out by Danny and become the team's distraction when they are surrounded in a bus by Future Predators ‚Äì a vicious fight ensures that the team escapes. As they do, a huge Megopteran appears and heads in their direction, but is not seen afterwards. This particularly large Megopteran may have been the dominant queen or leader of the nest. They are shown to have an ovipositor, with which they can lay eggs into a host. Three creatures re- appear in the Series 3 finale and are seen rampaging around in Christine Johnson's base. Two are killed by Becker using electrical wires and the third one is presumably dead. =Mer Creature= The Mer Creatures first appear in episode 2.4. They are aquatic predators from the future, using the sewer network to hunt and trap prey. They successfully capture a teenage boy called Lucien Hope, and then Abby, before dragging Abby into their time zone. After being rescued by Nick and Connor, Lucien kills one of the Mer by throwing a stone at its head, before Stephen shows up and shoots the rest, killing them too. Meanwhile, Connor travels through the Anomaly into the future to find Abby and throws a stone at the head of a Mer threatening her, killing it, before attempting to pull her up onto the cliff ledge he is standing on to help her escape the Mer Queen. Nick arrives in time to help him pull Abby to safety, and then he and Stephen shoot and kill the Mer Queen and the rest of the attacking Mer Creatures. Cutter later speculates that the Mer may be descendants of humans. There appear to be two types of Mer; * The Mer Queen who is red in colour, and much larger than her subordinates. She has tusks on her lower jaw, whereas the others do not. When Abby attempts to escape from the future, the Mer Queen reacts violently, to the point that she crushes any other Mer in her path. * The remaining Mer are blueish in colour, and work at capturing food. They do not immediately kill their prey, instead dragging it back to their home, where presumably it is later consumed. In episode 2.6 and 2.7, it is revealed Oliver has managed to acquire two Mer Creatures for his collection. The creatures would escape from the feeding chamber, and attempts to break down a door to leave the bunker, before returning to the feeding room in an attempt by Nick, Stephen and Helen to trap the creatures there, so that they kill each other. =Unknown millipede= The Silurian is shown as being home to not only Silurian scorpions, but also millipedes which roam in groups across the sand. They prefer to hide in the sand but may emerge if frightened by a predator. These millipedes are likely to be the staple food source for the giant scorpions. In episode 2.5, Nick Cutter and Stephen Hart noticed a large group of them travelling on the sand, which they failed to realise were fleeing from the scorpions. One entered the present era briefly but was captured by Abby in a ball pool before it was returned into the past. =Mosasaur= Mosasaurs were serpentine marine reptiles and ferocious predators. Mosasaurs were not dinosaurs but evolved from semi-aquatic squamates known as the aigialosaurs, close relatives of modern-day monitor lizards. Mosasaurs breathed air and were powerful swimmers that were well- adapted to living in the warm, shallow epicontinental seas prevalent during the Late Cretaceous Period. Mosasaurs are intensely territorial and cannibals, and the only meetings between them that do not end in violence occur when the Mosasaurs in question are of opposite sexes, and there is the possibility of mating. The Mosasaur was shown to have an armoured crocodile-like body, but in reality it would have been smooth-skinned and streamlined, and covered in more lizard- or snake-like scales. Also it swallowed the lifeguard whole even though its jaw and enlarged neck muscles were evolved to tear and rip prey apart. The Mosasaur depicted also has a more tapering, snake-like body than its real life counterpart, and a pair of short horns over the head, like a theropod dinosaur. N =Neovenator= In the Primeval spin-off novel The Lost Island, the team witness a pack of three Neovenator attack a herd of Iguanodon, but it is not known if the hunt is successful. Cutter initially mistakes them for Allosaurids but their presence nonetheless gives Cutter reason to move the team from their hunting grounds. O =Ornitholestes= Ornitholestes is a species of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Jurassic, 150 million years ago. Ornitholestes are stalkers; they track their prey by stalking it through the woods, and will usually attack the smaller members of groups of prey. Ornitholestes are also highly aggressive, and can be easily provoked into attacking other creatures. They can also be quickly brought down by shooting them directly in the neck with an electric dart, but shooting them in the side or below the neck has little effect. At least one Ornitholestes was taken by Project Magnet from the Mount Seymour Anomaly incursion, and sent to a research laboratory in Vancouver, where it was subjected to gruesome experiments from which it apparently at some point died. P =Pachycephalosaurus= In the past Jenny, Helen Cutter and the men supporting the British team observe a Tyrannosaurus hunting and killing a Pachycephalosaurus, which is described as having a knobbed head and using the domed forehead for display rather than head-butting, according to Helen. In Primeval New World, a Pachycephalosaurus went on a rampage smashing windows mistaking its own reflection to be a rival. It was taken down by the team, but sneezed on Evan before it became unconscious. The Creature was secretly taken by Ken Leeds to the Project Magnet facility, where it was experimented on and died at some point. =Parasite= This previously undiscovered species is a cestoid Parasite, up to long and weighing up to from the late Holocene. The Parasites belong to the group Taeniidae. which are distinguished from the other families of the order Cestoidea by having a distinct head, furnished with four suctorial discs. They did not come to the present directly, but instead were carried through by 2 dodos that were their hosts at that point. They feed off the nutrients in the bloodstream of its host, destroying the internal organs in the process. It then burrows into the brain of the carrier and manipulates it for the benefit of the Parasite. The Parasite causes the host to become aggressive and photophobic. The bite of the host serves to spread the Parasite's eggs, which are released into the saliva, to a new host. It is hinted that the parasites could be responsible for the vampire myth. The mature Parasites would kill the host and themselves as part of their reproductive cycle. Each individual has male and female reproductive structures in its proglottid and can reproduce independently. Any warm-blooded creature is an acceptable host, even humans. =Postosuchus= Postosuchus was a land living crocodilian that lived in North America and was the top predator in its ecosystem. A Postosuchus seemingly comes through an anomaly to a South African Safari Park and kills a Eustreptospondylus (however, it is later revealed that both creatures were captured and transported the park by Tom Samuels' people). It later kills several zebra and wildebeest. The creature is later lured by an impala and attacks the team before Sophie sacrifices her life to save Danny. The creature is killed when it is shot in its stomach. Several postosuchus are used for patrolling Samuels' oil refinery as \\"guard dogs\\" and are controlled with an electric shock collar. A postosuchus later kills park worker Ted as well as Samuels. A family of Postosuchus are later seen attempting to escape from their cage. It is unknown if the family survive the oil refinery's destruction although the cage may have protected them. Like the Gorgonopsid, they had tremendous power; therefore they would have caused havoc between herds of creatures in their own time. Postosuchus is portrayed being a quadrupedal animal in the show, however recent scientific finds revealed that the animal was bipedal. =Polacanthus= In the Primeval spin- off novel The Lost Island the team run into a sleeping herd of Polacanthus when marooned in the Cretaceous. Cutter carefully manages to move the team around the group of Ankylosaurs, and later they observe a herd of them associating with Iguanodon. =Pristichampsus= The Pristichampsus was described by Adrian Hodges and Tim Haines as a \\"bit souped-up for our show ‚Äì bigger, more powerful, all that sort of stuff\\" and \\"a running crocodile, he's also quite bipedal\\". It seems to be based on the real fossil crocodilian genus Pristichampsus, of which one species (P. rollinatii) was facultatively bipedal. Pristichampsus has a vague similarity to Amut, it is later revealed that the Ancient Egyptians thought that the creature was the god Sobek, because of the similarities that they have, and that the anomaly was a gateway to the land of the gods. The series' creators have also confirmed it will be found in the Thames river and then destroy a kitchen. In the new ITV Winter Spring Showreel, the Primeval trailer briefly shows the Pristichampsus rearing over cars and swimming in the river. A Pristichampsus came through an anomaly in episode 3.1. It killed the caretaker Marianne but left her body, possibly as a warning to competitors. It attacked Sarah Page but escaped from the museum at its first opportunity through the docking door. It went on to kill a traffic warden and then swam across the Thames to a restaurant, attracted by the scent of hot food. It escaped to the top floor in a lift and attacked a cleaning woman. Cutter saved her by luring it out of a window. The Pristichampsus fell, injuring its leg. It then started to return to the museum and the anomaly, its instinct to survive outweighing its instinct to hunt. Cutter, Becker and an armed escort met the creature there, but taking Sarah and Abby's advice, bowed to show there were not a threat. The Pristichampsus passed them without attacking and climbed through the anomaly just before it closed. Throughout the episode, several other Pristichampsus almost came through the anomaly. It was revealed in the episode that Pristichampsus was the inspiration for the Egyptian goddess Amut. Cutter used this as an example that some of the anomalies and the creatures that came through them were the inspiration for myths and legends. =Pteranodon= Pteranodon was a large Pterosaur, notable for its skull crest. These may have been used as mating displays, or it might have acted as a rudder, or perhaps both; also, it may have acted as a counterweight to the large beak. Despite its huge size, at Pteranodon is not the biggest of the pterosaurs; creatures such as Quetzalcoatlus could reach . It could, like the modern-day albatross, glide by navigating through thermals because the Pteranodon had a high aspect ratio (wingspan to chord length) similar to that of the albatross ‚Äî 9:1 for Pteranodon, compared to 8:1 for an albatross, but was also fully capable of powered flight. In episode 1.5, a Pteranodon appears from an anomaly above a golf course, where it apparently attacks Connor and Rex. After some chasing, Connor and Rex jump down a hill as the Pteranodon swoops and flies away above them. It was assumed that this creature was responsible for the death of a golfer earlier. Later Stephen discovers that its diet contains fish and small reptiles but no human remains, proving that it did not kill the golfer and the real killer is still out there. This also proves that it was trying to catch Rex, not kill Connor. Also, a Pteranadon appears in the opening of episode 2.2 attacking Helen Cutter after she steals one of its eggs, though this was unrelated to the events of the episode. A Pteranadon appears again in episode 3.10 attacking Helen Cutter as she tries to go through an anomaly and causes her to drop her anomaly device. =Pterosaur= Pterosaurs are (sometimes very large) flying reptiles, that lived in the Upper Triassic to Upper Cretaceous periods. They are not dinosaurs. In episode 1.3, Nick Cutter travels through an underwater anomaly and finds himself in a Cretaceous tropical sea, 75 million years ago. As he comes ashore and puts his scuba down on the beach he observed several Pterosaurs flying and feeding over the coastal waters. In The Lost Island an unidentified Pterosaur species are described resting on rocks, and basking in the sun with their wings open like the modern-day cormorant. R =Raptor= Raptors are bipedal carnivores with a long, stiffened tail and had an enlarged, sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to kill their prey. Males were a lot stronger than the females, as the female in the show needed one indirect dose of tranquilliser to bring her down, while the male needed three direct doses of tranquilliser to bring him down, could burst through a shutter, and drag a fully-grown man. Raptors lived and hunted in packs. It was one of only five species, along with the future predators, worms, giant spiders and Embolotherium where juvenile specimens have been seen. Juvenile Raptors display morphological differences such as the arms, which were proportionally longer than those of adults. There has been confusion as to the identity of the raptors. While the first news entry claim the genus was Velociraptor, both the official ITV site and Primeval site state that the raptors were based upon Deinonychus. It has been seen they live in Africa in the late Cretaceous, 95 million years ago, where no Deinonychus has been found. Although, at one point the Primeval site did state that the raptors were based on Utahraptor. More recently they were listed as Dromaeosaurus. In the series, the parents appear to invest little care in their young and are likely to forget the offspring is theirs if separated for too long, often resulting in cannibalism, although it was not confirmed that the cannibal Raptor was a parent and may have just been a rogue, or that if raptors were like lions, then Rogue was killing the defeated male's offspring. Raptors are shown as being covered in scales with a small crest of protofeathers that can be raised up like hackles when attacking. In real life, as well as in most TV series and movies, Raptors are known to be better parents than this. In episode 2.1 two adults and an infant Deinonychus came through a shopping mall anomaly; one adult was decapitated by the closing anomaly, the other was returned and the infant was cannibalised by one of the adults. They appear again in The Lost Island novel, hunting and killing three people marooned with the team in the Early Cretaceous. They are described as being Dromaeosaurs, but are also said to bear a resemblance to the Raptors in the earlier shopping mall episode. In episode 2.6 and episode 2.7 at least two fully grown Deinonychus were seen in Leeks creature prison. They were killed in a fight with other creatures at the end of the episode 2.7. In episode 5.3, a female Deinonychus was responsible for several murders in the Victorian era. Matt and Emily encounter it and have a small battle with it. It later kills Henry Merchant before being shot multiple times with an EMD by Becker. The Deinonychus also appears on the Watch YouTube game. It takes one shot to kill it. S =Sarcopterygian= One fossilised member of this group appears in the first episode, Cutter explaining that this specimen appears in the fossil record at a time when it should have been extinct for 70 million years, and the fact that a live one appeared in the Indian Ocean. This suggests that there has been at least one anomaly in the distant past, and one outside of Britain. This was later confirmed in the Primeval spin-off novel Shadow of the Jaguar. =Sauroposeidon= The largest animal to ever appear in the Primeverse. =Scutosaurus= Scutosaurus was a genus of armour-covered Permian period pareiasaur, loosely related to the turtles. Its genus name refers to large plates of bony scutes (osteoderms) set in the skin, as a defence against predators. But the most unusual thing about them were the heavy skulls ornamented with strange knobs and ridges. It was of a very heavy build, almost rhinoceros-like. Unlike most reptiles, held its legs underneath its body with stubby toes to support its great weight. A Scutosaurus first appears in Episode 1.1, and was the first prehistoric creature Connor, Nick, Stephen and Claudia ever saw (and the third one Abby sees after Rex and a Gorgonopsid). The team discover it in the Forest of Dean; they also see an Anomaly for the first time when the Scutosaurus then leads them to it, returning to its own time period. Nick and Captain Ryan see several of them after travelling through the Anomaly in question later in the same episode, then again after going through it a second time in Episode 1.6. In Episode 2.6, it is revealed that Oliver's men somehow captured two Scutosaurus and that they have become part of Oliver's creature army; they escape along with the other creatures after Nick tricks Oliver into freeing them and one is encountered by Connor, Abby, Jenny and Caroline; they use it to kill two of Oliver's armed men by provoking it to move forwards, trampling the two men to death. Although both of them return to the prison after being lured there along with the other creatures by Nick, Helen and Stephen, they almost certainly played no part whatsoever in Stephen's subsequent death as they were established as non-aggressive animals. It is assumed that after killing Stephen, the more aggressive creatures then turned on and killed each other, presumably killing the two Scutosaurus in the process. These fearsome-looking animals were in fact inoffensive herbivores, which were well adapted to the dry conditions which covered much of Pangaea at that time. A social animal, they migrated in large groups. The leaf-shaped multi-cusped teeth resemble those of iguanas, caseids, and other reptilian herbivores. This dentition, together with the deep capacious body which would have housed an extensive digestive tract. When in the past, they see several more Scutosaurus roaming a desert. Although initially described correctly as a pareiasaur, this species is from then on called a dinosaur throughout the episode in which it appears. Although based on the heavily armoured species called Scutosaurus kapinski that lived about 250 million years ago in Russia, the size of the Scutosaurus in the series is exaggerated. It is described as at least \\"five or six tons\\" in weight, about as big as an elephant. In fact the actual Scutosaurus was much smaller, no more than in length. They appear locked up at the end of episode 2.7. =Shrew-like Creature= In a small building used by the Russian anomaly team used for captured specimens, Cutter observes a pair of small shrew-like creatures scuttling around in a tank, while explaining to Abby how the mammals inherit the Earth after the K-T Event. =Silurian scorpion= The Silurian scorpion is a prehistoric creature from the Silurian that grows to immense sizes, and is a variety of animal similar to Brontoscorpio. They have a long whip-like tail, spikes on the foreclaws and a flattened body, similar to modern day whip scorpions. The scorpions never come through the anomaly in their first appearance, but did in the second-season finale, along with many other creatures. They are probably reimagined from the ones in Walking with Monsters by the producers to make them bigger and more frightening. They hunt by sensing surface vibrations and burrowing underground, similar to the giant worms from the film Tremors. Their main food source appears to be the Silurian millipedes. In reality, scorpions of this size would not be able to breathe, let alone move about. The scorpions made a reappearance in episode 2.7. One of them was released onto a crowded beach by Oliver Leek to show his power, where it killed two tourists and scared everyone else away. Stephen Hart set out to deal with it on his own, and harpooned it below a bridge. The still alive creature was left to be collected at leisure. Its fate was unknown, but presumably it was killed. They appear in a flashback in episode 3.2, when Cutter recognises the Cleaner and thought he was killed by the scorpions. They are referred to as \\"Silurian scorpions\\" in the episode, but they are listed as \\"giant scorpion\\" on the Primeval official websites. =Smilodon= Smilodon is a vicious carnivorous sabre-toothed cat that lived in the Pleistocene in both North and South America. They are commonly and incorrectly called \\"sabre toothed tigers\\" where, in truth, all modern day tigers evolved from a different line. A fully-grown Smilodon weighed approximately and had a short tail, powerful legs, and a large head. The cats have two huge canine teeth, about long, that are used to kill prey by suffocation. The jaws could open to about 120 degrees in order to use these fangs to deadly effect. They would die out due to climate change. Smilodon was mentioned in episode 1.4 by Helen Cutter as \\"sabre-toothed killers\\". However, she apparently lied when she claimed they would come through at that point, and escaped through the Spaghetti Junction. They are also seen, in skeleton form, in Nick's office. A Smilodon appeared for the first time in episode 2.3, where it is responsible for a number of deaths at a theme park. When the team hear of this, Connor wonders why the Anomaly detector he has recently built didn't detect an Anomaly in the theme park; it is later revealed that the Smilodon had came through its Anomaly as a cub years before the events of the episode, and had been kept as a pet by a ranger called Valerie who had lost control of it as it became more aggressive and turned man-eater upon maturing; she was certain that her pet would never hurt her after all she had done for it over the years, but was proved wrong when it later killed her. At the end of the episode, Oliver claims the cat is dead, killed by an apparent heart attack after being tranquillised; Nick questions how this could have happened when it was a perfectly healthy animal. Oliver is revealed to have been lying in episode 2.7, where it is revealed he has built up his own army of creatures that his men have kidnapped from their own time and that the Smilodon is now one of the creatures in his army. He tries to use it to kill Connor, Abby, Jenny and Caroline, but Nick tricks him into opening the prison and the Smilodon escapes. It is later lured back to the prison along with the other creatures by Nick, Helen and Stephen; it then participates in killing Stephen. It is assumed that the creatures turned on and killed each other after killing Stephen and that the Smilodon, and the rest of Oliver's creatures, are all dead.Primeval filming in Thorpe Park =Spinosaurus= The Spinosaurus is the largest carnivorous dinosaur, weighing and in length. It lived in Africa in the late Cretaceous. It is bipedal has a large \\"sail\\" on its back, though the one in the show included an additional mini sail on its tail. In episode 4.1, a Spinosaurus is stalking Connor and Abby in the Cretaceous when the pair open an anomaly to the present using Helen's anomaly device. Abby lures a raptor towards the territorial Spinosaurus to distract it, and the larger dinosaur wins the fight while the two slip through the anomaly. When the anomaly was accidentally unlocked it came through and rampaged through the city, and was lured into an arena to be contained. Connor attempted to open another anomaly as Abby distracted it with lights and music and Becker and his men brought it down with their new EMDs. However it got back up and tried to attack Connor and Matt who were hanging from the ceiling, and it swallows the anomaly device and disappears into the anomaly created by it inside the Spinosaurus' stomach. Spinosaurus was seen again in Episode 5.5, though this was stock from 4.1. =Stegosaurus= Stegosaurus is the largest and most famous member of the Stegosaurid family, growing up to in length and more than capable of defending itself from predators with the four spikes on the end of its tail. A row of plates along its back, its most recognisable feature, may have been used as a cooling system in hot weather or to flash colour that could be used to entice mates or threaten enemies and predators. Series 4 webisode 1 includes CCTV footage of a Stegosaurus causing havoc in the House of Commons during the time between Series 3 and 4. However this was not a real Stegosaurus, the CG model was that of the Embolotherium, re-used with close up footage. It is never revealed what happened to the Stegosaurus after its rampage through the House of Commons, but it had certainly been dealt with somehow by the time the events of Series 4 began. =Swimming Theropod= A juvenile theropod was found unconscious in the North Sea and taken on board a naval submarine. After awakening, it attacked and killed a crewman. It was stunned by Abby and Connor, and then expelled through a torpedo-like tube into the Jurassic seas where it was eaten by a Liopleurodon. T =Terror Bird= Terror birds are large carnivorous flightless birds that were the dominant predators in South America shortly during the Cenozoic period, 62-2.5 million years ago. They were roughly tall. Titanis walleri, one of the largest species, is known from North America, marking one of the comparatively rare examples where animals that evolved in South America managed to spread north after the Isthmus of Panama land bridge formed. Their wings evolved into meat hook-like structures that likely could be outstretched like arms to perform a hacking motion to help bring down prey. Like the armour-plated ostriches they resemble, terror birds are also very fast runners. They first appear in episode 3.6. They first came through the anomaly in the 1950s, and attacked and killed scientists that were studying the anomaly. When the anomaly reopened in the present day, they came through again, and one was drawn to a cabin the team were hiding it due to a recording of a distress call of the birds they had accidentally played. It chased the team in their car, and Danny Quinn fought it off with a pipe before they crashed. Abby Maitland and Sarah Page fled while Danny used Connor Temple as bait to draw in the bird, trapping it by hooking its leg into the car's tow cable. Abby and Sarah were chased by several more and chased to a minefield along with Danny and Connor, and Danny lured one onto a mine, killing it. Another attacked and killed one of Captain Ross's soldiers and was killed as the car exploded on a mine and the shrapnel cut through the bird's neck. The rest of the flock attacked the cabin, and Connor distracted them so that Danny could play the distress call recording to lure them back to the anomaly. A single terror bird attacked in a prison in episode 4.7, coming through a \\"satellite anomaly\\" and killing a tourist. It returned through the main anomaly and was driven back by the team, however it appeared through another satellite anomaly Abby and Becker found. It was allowed to go through the main anomaly, but it returned again to distract the team as they were attempting to capture Ethan Dobrowski. Connor and Abby chased after it, and Danny arrived to help knock it through a satellite anomaly. Again the terror bird returned, this time being brought down by Matt Anderson's EMD. Abby contained it in a storage closet, but it was set free by Ethan/Patrick to menace Emily Merchant, but was able to use a club to bring it down again. It was presumably returned to its own time after that. =Therocephalian= Therocephalians are an extinct suborder of carnivorous eutheriodont therapsids that lived from the middle and late Permian into the Triassic. Therocephalians (\\"beast-heads\\") are named after their large skulls, which, along with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were successful carnivores. Like other non-mammalian synapsids, therocephalians are described as mammal-like reptiles, although in fact, Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals. The earlier therocephalians were in many respects as primitive as the gorgonopsids, but they did show certain advanced features. The discovery of maxilloturbinal ridges in some specimens suggests that at least some therocephalians may have been warm- blooded. A species of Therocephalian appears in episode 4.4. Numerous creatures the size of a large dog come through an anomaly at a school, and kill a teacher and a female student. Matt, Becker, and Connor deal with the venomous creatures, and Becker was bitten by one of the venomous creatures to paralyse him, but later recovered. =Titanoboa= A Titanoboa appears in episode 2 of Primeval: New World. A reoccuring anomaly alloweda Titanoboa to travel between its own time and a bay in modern day Vancouver. The Titanoboa killed two Merison oil employees and pursued the Special Projects Group through the oil facility, before being sent back through its anomaly back to its own time. =Thylacosmilus= Thylacosmilus was a pouched carnivore, resembling a sabre-toothed cat, that lived in South America 2 million years ago. It had a long, curving chin and a large pair of sabre teeth used for killing its prey. Thylacosmilus would become extinct due to being outcompeted by true sabre-tooth cats such as Smilodon. In Shadow of the Jaguar, the first known anomaly to open overseas is in a biological reserve in the Peruvian rainforest and allows a pack of Thylacosmilus access to the modern world. They proceed to go on the rampage, wiping out several small villages, killing one of the sons of a senior man to Sir James Lester (Sir Charles), killing a sloth and killing several members of the SAS. A second pride of six Thylacosmilus are followed and some are killed by the SAS. It turns out that the Thylacosmilus are under the control of a creature from the future, which is using pheromones to control the pack's instinct and use them like hunting hounds. After the team disrupt the bird's control, the Thylacosmilus flee in terror back through the anomaly, just before it closes. =Torosaurus= In Extinction Event, several large groups of Torosaurus are seen. They are described as having huge frills, long horns and being aggressively unpredictable. In the first instance, a mother is killed whilst defending her calf and almost killing Connor in the process, and her calf is then killed by an unseen predator, which later turns out to be a Tyrannosaurus. Later on, a large herd is found by a river, and several animals are killed after a tank fires at them. The Torosaurus then attack the tanks and succeed in killing the driver. =Tree creeper= Large (approx. 2 m high) Cretaceous an ape-like arboreal dinosaur, the so-called \\"tree creeper,\\" named by Emily Merchant, can climb easily using its claws and its long prehensile tail; it can also use its tail to snare its prey from above. It is a vicious carnivore with a head similar to that of a raptor, and legs featuring retractable sickle-claws. There is no current evidence to support what an actual one might look like, and the creature's actual species name, if any, is unknown. Two tree creepers come through an anomaly in a London theatre in episode 4.3; another attacks Emily in the Cretaceous period before Matt rescues her. It gives chase back through the anomaly, only to be blasted back home by EMD fire. One of the two creatures who makes it through the anomaly is immediately shot by Becker, and the other falls to its death from a rooftop, after being chased there by Matt and Emily. A tree creeper also appears in episode 5.5, when it comes through an anomaly that bursts open in the ARC car-park. For comic effect, It curiously investigates Lester's new Jaguar, but Lester comes to the car's rescue, bringing the creature down with a few EMD bursts. Whether this creature was sent back through the anomaly is unknown. =Triceratops= A Triceratops came through an anomaly into a food by a skating park in Vancouver, British Columbia. Evan and Dylan followed it to Evan's old rival Howard Kanan who witnessed it charge at Evan late it was discovered that it was attracted by Dylan's red coat which they used to lure it back through the anomaly before it closed but unfortunately Howard followed it through and was marooned in the Cretaceous. =Troodon= Troodon are small carnivorous dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous. They had the largest brain of any dinosaur. Several are encountered in Extinction Event, where they are described as being intelligent, ruthless predators. They were first encountered feasting on the carcass of a dead Anatotitan, which had apparently been killed by shock, as a result of a meteor strike. Later, Jenny and Helen Cutter are in the Cretaceous period, and one of the SAS soldiers assigned to help them, Tim Jenkins, was dragged away by the Troodons, who ate him alive due to his crippling caused by a Dimetrodon. The rest of the team were too late to save him. Later in the present, a pack of Troodon showed up at the overturned car Jenny and Hemple were in. Jenny attempted to keep them at bay by using a large metal rod that she had found in the truck's wreck. However, one of the Troodon then knocked her down to the ground, and pinned her down, with its foot. Just as it was about to kill her, the car's ruptured fuel tank caught on fire, scaring the Troodons away. =Tyrannosaurus= Tyrannosaurus is the most well known carnivorous dinosaur despite not being the largest. In Extinction Event, a pair of Tyrannosaurus stalk the forests of Siberia, referred to many as Baba Yaga after a figure in Russian folklore. The female does most of the damage, killing a Torosaurus calf and several men before it encounters the male Tyrannosaurus, which has just arrived from the Cretaceous having killed a Pachycephalosaurus. The male and female fight, and the female kills her smaller rival. Surprisingly, the female Tyrannosaurus is not stopped, and merely returns to the dank, Russian forests, having killed her competitor. In Episode 5.5 one rampaged through the streets of London, killing a few people until shot multiple times by Matt with an EMD knocking the creature out. This creature was the initial cause of the public's realisation of the anomalies. U =Unknown Theropod= The Unknown Theropod is an unknown species of large, tyrannosaur-like theropod dinosaur from the Cretaceous. Abby Maitland documented this theropod in her diary during the time when she and Connor Temple were marooned in the Cretaceous, and the document on the theropod was ultimately unintentionally burnt by Abby. =Utahraptor= Utahraptor is the largest raptor in the dromaeosaurid family. In The New World, Two Utahraptors came through an Anomaly to Stanley Park in the present, and stalked the Park. One raptor chased Evan Cross and Dylan Weir back through the Anomaly into the Cretaceous, and Evan and Dylan then returned through the Anomaly to the present. The anomaly then closed, leaving one Utahraptor still marooned in the present. The Utahraptor travelled to Vancouver, killing Tony Drake and a homeless man. It later returned to Stanley park where it battled a Pteranodon. the Utahraptor killed the Pteranodon, but then died of its injuries in the fight. The two carcasses were frozen at Cross Photonics. V =Velociraptor= In episode 3.4, a huge anomaly opens, in an aeroplane hangar. Nigel Marven and a media team is called to investigate. A juvenile Velociraptor runs out of it and bites Nigel on the hand. It then runs back through the anomaly just before the Giganotosaurus comes through. Raptors also made an appearance in episode 3.10, attacking Danny Quin, Conner Temple and Abby Maitland. Three are seen feasting on another raptor's carcass in a forest and they then proceed to attack the three members of the team before they were knocked out by a stun grenade. Another raptor later followed Danny through an anomaly into Pliocene Africa and charged at Helen and knocks her off a cliff, killing them both. In episode 4.1 in the Cretaceous a male raptor takes Abby's blanket to decorate its bower so as to impress a mate. It was later lured by Abby with her blanket to provide a distraction for a Spinosaurus standing near an anomaly, and after a brief fight the raptor was killed. Six Velociraptors came through an anomaly into a wet and rainy Maidenhead in Fire and Water. They were all returned but several were shot in the past when they tried to kill Becker and they did succeed in killing one of his colleagues, Jamie Weavers. W =Worm= Although many invertebrates are commonly called worms, the Primeval worms are very large carnivorous worms from some time before the oxygen catastrophe, 2.7 billion years ago. In reality such a creature is impossible ‚Äì for any lifeform to grow that big it would need an atmosphere more energy-rich than the fog they live in and they would not be able to breathe let alone move in it. The worms have long retractable mouthparts, large enough to engulf a man, for feeding. These creatures were based on marine ragworms. The worms need movement to sense their prey, and can be fooled if a person stands still and throws an inanimate object In the episode, the worms cannot survive outside the \\"fog\\", which is first shown when Nick and Stephen trap the mouthparts in a door separating the fog: if separated from their natural atmosphere, oxygen, highly poisonous to them, kills them. The fog is the Pre-Cambrian atmosphere, which presumably comes through the anomaly. When they are faced with an increase of heat, they explode to spawn their young which then attempt to burrow into a living host. This life cycle is not dissimilar to the parasite. They can also spit a brown- coloured slime, which might be used to track or even attack their prey. It also reappears in a classroom during the convergence of the anomalies in Series 5. They appear to resemble the Carnictis from the 2005 remake of King Kong References External links * Primeval site: creatures section Creatures Primeval ","title":"List of creatures in Primeval"},{"id":"9438312","text":"Rumjatar is a market in Siddhicharan Municipality in the Okhaldhunga District in the Sagarmatha Zone of mid-eastern Nepal.

Schaafsma (May 4, 1934 ‚àí November 11, 1992) was a pioneer in women's sports in both basketball and volleyball, as well as a pioneer in collegiate athletics administration for female athletes. Her books on these two sports were among the first and best-known on the subjects. Women's Basketball, Physical Education Activities Series was published in 1966 and Basketball for Women was published in 1971. Volleyball for Coaches and Teachers was first published in 1974; a second edition was published in 1985. Volleyball, Exploring Sports Series was published in 1984. Schaafsma became the women's basketball coach for Long Beach State in 1962. Beginning in 1965 when conference play began, she led the 49ers to 11 straight conference titles. In all, Schaafsma coached the team for 17 seasons, beginning with play in the Southern California Women's Conference, then the Extramural Coordinating Council of Southern California Colleges, the Southern California Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and finally the Western Collegiate Athletic Association. Schaafsma's record at Long Beach was 209-73, including a final season mark in 1978-79 of 24-8. Schaafsma never had a losing season at Long Beach; in fact, the 49ers first losing season did not come until 1992-93, 2 years after her successor, Joan Bonvicini, left for the University of Arizona. Schaasfma coached the women's volleyball team from 1962 through 1970. Her final team finished fourth in the AIAW Championships.

Background He started out in engineering science on a scholarship at the University of Toronto, but then became preoccupied with existential questions, leading him into unconventional areas of study, with the result that he graduated in 1974 with an interdisciplinary BSc. After some years working as a roofer, he enrolled at the University of Calgary and, in 1983, completed an MSc in mathematics with specialization in mathematical foundations, writing his thesis about forcing in topoi. He switched to psychology graduating in 1989 from the University of Regina with a PhD in psychology and specialization in the study of consciousness. Since 1987 he has been teaching courses in psychology, mostly about consciousness, at King's University College, where he has risen to the rank of professor. He has served in a number of administrative roles including Chair of the Department of Psychology and member of the Senate of the University of Western Ontario, and belongs to various professional organizations including the Society for Scientific Exploration and the New York Academy of Sciences. Research interests His interest is in all aspects of consciousness studies although his research has been focussed primarily on quantum consciousness, altered states of consciousness, self- transformation, mathematical modeling of consciousness, and beliefs about consciousness and reality. Books * Science as a Spiritual Practice (Imprint Academic, 2007) This book argues that there are problems with materialism and that self-transformation could lead individual scientists to more comprehensive ways of understanding reality. It also contains an analysis of the philosophy of Franklin Merrell-Wolff and his mathematical approach to spirituality.Publisher's information * Alterations of Consciousness: An Empirical Analysis for Social Scientists (American Psychological Association, 2003). The book is an overview of alterations of consciousness such as daydreaming, sleep, dreaming, hypnosis, and psychedelics. * Authentic Knowing: The Convergence of Science and Spiritual Aspiration (Purdue University Press, 1996) This book tries to show how science and spiritual aspiration converge on fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and reality when authentically pursued. The book includes chapters about authenticity (what it means to be true to oneself), science (what happens when science encounters the sublime), transcendence (the promise of enlightenment), theory (a theosophical model of reality), and self-transformation (adventures and misadventures of a spiritual aspirant). * The Personal Nature of Notions of Consciousness: A Theoretical and Empirical Examination of the Role of the Personal in the Understanding of Consciousness(University Press of America, 1990) This book is his doctoral dissertation in which Baruss and his supervisor Robert Moore tried to circumscribe the state of scientific knowledge concerning consciousness in the mid-1980s and to better understand the disparity of notions of consciousness of the scientists and academics studying it. What we found, both through theoretical and empirical investigation, was that there is a material-transcendent dimension concerning beliefs about consciousness and reality that underlies the Western intellectual tradition, which, in particular, colours the manner in which research about consciousness is conducted.

Robin York and Philip Loraine (1 May 1920 ‚Äì 24 October 2002) was a British author of suspense fiction and a screenwriter. Biography He was born Robin Phillip Lorraine Estridge on 1 May 1920, in London, England. His real name was Robin Estridge, but he mostly published novels under the name of Robin York and Philip Loraine. Today, he has been somewhat forgotten by many readers as well as collectors of crime fiction. Sea Change (1982) is one of his best-known novels. An introductory note to And to My Beloved Husband written under the pseudonym Philip Loraine (Ace Books, N.Y., year of publication missing, originally published by M.S. Mill Co, 1950) provides the following information about the author: > \\"Philip Loraine has published a number of top-notch suspense novels in the > United States, and under his real name has written other books, as well as > film and television scripts.\\" Loraine has also been a sailor in the Royal Navy, a theatrical designer, a dishwasher in Paris, a journalist, and a tubercular patient. Besides five years in the United States, he also resided in Corsica, Italy, Yugoslavia, Spain and, as seldom as possible, his native England. He liked writing, peace and quiet, sunshine, and new places. He disliked bad food, bad manners, people who think of themselves as intellectual, bigotry, politics, and politicians. Estridge died on 24 October 2002 in Astoria, Oregon.

Valdeande is located on the north part of the shore of the Duero. It separate 27 kilometers of Aranda and 90 of towns. Clearly tie locality to agriculture, has in the Esgueva river its main fluvial course, that bathes the western part of the municipality creating an extensive fertile valley. History In the municipality they have been recognized, like older vestiges, different rest from the Roman time. This territory was crossed by one of the routes that Clunia with the valley of the Arlanza river united, being in its route the villa of Ciella. Other findings of crossings and wakes give certainty, also, of the possible existence of a small community hispanovisigoda in Valdeande. Valdeande also was present in Reconquista. While, the first written document appears in 1037, a manuscript of Fernando I of Castile. Forced places Church of San Pedro Apostle The church rises superficially on a parapet, constructed with stone of ashlar masonry and, the tower of the present bell tower, whose first stage could be related to the fortified tower of the 11th century. In the 13th century to the second body of the tower and the porch of the church would rise. In the construction different architectonic styles are mixed that they go from Romanesque the delayed one (porch), happening through gothic (large windows) and the Renaissance one (greater altar), until practically our days. Old source The monument is located in the high part of the town. It keeps the form from chapel and it presents/displays an access to the spring by means of a double door conformed by twin arcs of average point and that are in favor separated of a column. Its origin is medieval, although it has an inscription of the year 1703 that alludes to a reconstruction. Archaeological Classroom of the Ciella Deposit The classroom is located in the superior floor of the building of the old schools. With this project it is tried to contribute to the visitor a real perception of which it was and it meant east Roman rural establishment. The classroom is structured in two zones. First it serves as general information with audio-visual panels, scale models and. The second zone is a recreation, to real size, of some of the main rooms of the Roman mansion. Ciella Deposit One is to the northwest of Valdeande. In that place the fertile valley took advantage of the Esgueva river to install a Roman mansion of rural character, that was the center of an extensive agrarian operation. At traverse a road was arrived at the capital of the Roman Legal Convent, located in Clunia and from dista which 13 kilometers. Goddess Madre Also she has appeared a stone goddess-mother, that would be the great archaeological finding of the zone.

History Ch√¢teau de l'√éle in Ostwald The ancient name of Ostwald, Wickersheim, is first attested on a map of the emperor Charles the Fat in 884. In the time of the emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, within the realm of the Holy Roman Empire, the Hohenstaufens built a castle by the Ill River. In 1285, the city was acquired by the Zorn family of Strasbourg and took the name of Illwickersheim, also sometimes called Sankt Ostwald after the name of a parish. The plague of 1348 and mercenary raids in 1365 and 1376 decimated the population. In 1418 the city of Strasbourg gained control of Illwickersheim; at the same time it acquired Illkirch- Graffenstaden. The act of annexation of Alsace to the kingdom of France took place in Illkirch in 1681, after which Illwickersheim experienced a period of peace and prosperity, with the introduction of potato farming, which saw an increase in the city's area and population. A new name under the influence of Irish missionaries was Oswald, in honor of Oswald of Northumbria. After the French Revolution the name settled on Ostwald, and during the 19th century the population doubled from 657 residents in 1806 to 1,290 in 1895. Ostwald became independent while it developed industry around the Soci√©t√© Alsacienne de Constructions M√©caniques (S.A.C.M.), agriculture and services, such as the Colonie agricole, the name of a youth internment center. In 1912 a quarry opened, creating many jobs, while the commune of Ostwald developed and augmented its infrastructure. The Second World War caused a recession and a bombing on 25 September 1944 reduced its population. During the postwar period the population grew, and in 1946 there were 3,200 residents. In 1954 the Soci√©t√© de Construction d'Ostwald (S.C.O.) constructed tenements. The urban development of the 1960s and 1970s caused expansion to new neighborhoods such as Wihrel and the construction of facilities such as schools and daycare centers. Population growth was rapid, from 3,584 residents in 1954 to 9,900 in 1982 and 10,820 in 1999. In the 1980s a shopping center, La Vigie, was constructed, which contained more than 40 businesses. Despite this, there are still 180 commercial establishments and artisans in the urban center.

Many books of Waplington's work have been published, both self-published and through Aperture, Cornerhouse, Mack, Phaidon, and Trolley. His work has been shown in solo exhibitions at Tate Britain and The Photographers' Gallery in London, at Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, USA, and at the National Museum of Photography, Film & Television in Bradford, UK; and in group exhibitions at Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy and Brooklyn Museum, New York City. In 1993 he was awarded an Infinity Award for Young Photographer by the International Center of Photography. His work is held in the permanent collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, Victoria and Albert Museum and Government Art Collection in London, National Gallery of Australia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Royal Library, Denmark. Life and work Waplington traveled extensively during his childhood as his father worked as a scientist in the nuclear industry. He studied art at West Sussex College of Art & Design in Worthing, Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham and the Royal College of Art in London. From 1984, Waplington would regularly visit his grandfather on the Broxtowe Estate in Aspley, Nottingham, where he began to photograph his immediate surroundings. Friends and neighbours of his family became his subject matter of choice. He continued with this work on and off for the next 15 years and from it came two books (Living Room and Weddings, Parties, Anything) and numerous exhibitions. His book Other Edens (1994) focused on environmental concerns and, although it was conceived and worked on at the same time as Living Room, was seen as a major departure in style and content. This work is global in nature and its ideas are ambiguous and multi- layered. Waplington's work was included in the touring exhibition, The Dead, curated by Val Williams and Greg Hobson, which opened at the National Museum of Photography, Film & Television in 1995. Other bodies of his work include Safety in Numbers (1997), a bleak study of the ecstasy drug culture in the mid-1990s; The Indecisive Memento, a global road trip where the journey itself was the artwork (1999); Truth or Consequences (2001), a pictorial game based on the history of photography using the town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico as a backdrop, inspired by the rules of the 1950s television show; and You Love Life (2005), in which he uses pictures taken over a 20-year period to construct an autobiographical narrative. Learn How to Die the Easy Way (2002), Waplington's contribution to a group exhibition in part of the Venice Biennale 2001,\\"Learn How to Die the Easy Way: Nick Waplington\\" T J Boulting. Accessed 3 July 2017 expressed a yearning for the artistic and commercial freedom that the web might yet expose and a celebration of the dislocated reason behind conventional thoughts and media. Waplington's graphic novel Terry Painter was made in collaboration with Miguel Calderon in 2003. This and other projects with Calderon including The Garden of Suburban Delights have been exhibited in Europe and the US. In December 2007, the project space at the Whitechapel Gallery in London showed his slide show of found internet photos, entitled You Are Only What You See. The work was available at the time bound together in 10 publications of 100 images each, and there was a separate catalog of original photos by Waplington called Double Dactyl (2008). Waplington worked on a major book project with the fashion designer Alexander McQueen during 2008/2009, called Working Process (2013), the title refers to both McQueen's working process as a fashion designer and Waplington's working process as an artist making photo books. In March 2015 this project became the first one-person exhibition by a British photographer in the main exhibition space at Tate Britain in London. In 2011 Waplington self-published Lackadaisical, using a print on demand service, his response to increasingly expensive photobooks. It was later edited and expanded in the form of another edition called Extrapolations. While continuing to make photographic works Waplington has since 2010 devoted most of his time to his practice as a painter. Waplington participated in the photography collective This Place, founded by Fr√©d√©ric Brenner, contributing the book Settlement (2014), a study of Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, portrait and landscape photographs taken with a large format camera.

Her husband was Chen Shubao, the last emperor of the dynasty. Shen Wuhua's father, Shen Junli (Ê≤àÂêõÁêÜ), was a junior official during the reign of Chen's founder Emperor Wu, and Emperor Wu, impressed by his abilities, created Shen Junli the Marquess of Wangcai (ÊúõËî°‰æØ) and gave Shen Junli his daughter the Princess Kuaiji as his wife. Shen Wuhua was born of the Princess Kuaiji, but her birth year is lost to history. Shen Junli subsequently served under Emperor Wu's nephews, Emperor Wen and Emperor Xuan. When Princess Kuaiji died, Shen Wuhua mourned her greatly and was praised for her filial piety. In 569, Shen Wuhua married Chen Shubao, who was then the crown prince under his father, Emperor Xuan. Her age at the time of their marriage is not known; he was 16. They did not have any sons together, but when Chen Shubao's concubine, Sun, died in childbirth in 573, Shen Wuhua raised the boy, Chen Yin, as her own. Her father, Shen Junli, died later that year, and she again mourned greatly. He was given the posthumous name Zhenxian (Ë≤ûÊÜ≤). In 582, Emperor Xuan died. Chen Shubao survived a failed coup attempt, albeit with substantial injuries, by his brother Chen Shuling (Èô≥ÂèîÈôµ), Prince of Shixing, and his cousin Chen Bogu (Èô≥‰ºØÂõ∫) the Prince of Xin'an. After taking the throne, Chen Shubao enthroned Shen Wuhua as empress, and Chen Yin as crown prince. However, as he did not favor her, she was not allowed to attend to him during his injuries-- only Zhang Lihua, his favorite concubine, was allowed to. Empress Shen was said to be solemn and had few desires, spending much of her time studying the Chinese classics, history, and Buddhist sutras as well as practicing calligraphy. She did not participate much in Chen Shubao's feasting, and he did not favor her, instead greatly favoring his Consort Zhang, who effectively took over the governance of the palace. Empress Shen had few complaints about that, however, and she lived a frugal life, limiting her staff to about 100 people and not using elaborate decorations, often submitting suggestions to Chen Shubao. In 588, believing in accusations that Chen Yin despised him for not favoring Empress Shen, Chen Shubao deposed him and replaced him with Consort Zhang's son, Chen Yuan. He also considered deposing Empress Shen and replacing her with Consort Chang, but had not had a chance to carry this out before Sui dynasty forces captured the capital Jiankang in 589, seizing him and ending the Chen dynasty, unifying China. Consort Zhang was executed by the Sui general, Gao Jiong, but Chen Shubao was spared and taken to the Sui capital, Chang'an, to be treated as an honored guest of Emperor Wen of Sui. Empress Shen followed Chen Shubao to Chang'an. She wrote deeply mournful texts to commemorate him when he died in 604. Earlier that year, Emperor Wen had died as well and was succeeded by his son, Emperor Yang of Sui, who, during his reign, undertook 11 journeys through various parts of the empire and often had Empress Shen accompany his train. She was with his train in Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 618, when he was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji.

Of these, there are five forts erected by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's former Dervish State in present-day Sool and Sanaag. Constructed between 1910 and 1915, most of the edifices are concentrated in the Sanaag region, including Jida Ali, Midhisho, Shimbir Bariis and Badhan. Taleh/Taleex is the largest of the structures. It was built around a collection of Dervish tombs, the earliest of which belong to Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman and Carro Seed Magan, the Dervish leader Hassan's mother. From 1910 to 1912, the Dervish constructed the main fort around the older tombs. They spent the next two years in the mountainous regions of Sanaag building three more smaller forts.The Geographical Journal, Vol. 78, No. 2 (Aug., 1931), pp. 125-128 =1919-1920= In 1919-1920, the British bombarded the Sanaag forts, where most of the Dervish had operated since 1913. Having destroyed the structures and driven out Hassan's men to Taleh in 1920, they finally attacked the town, assisted by horsemen and Somali clan heads. The settlement was bombarded by the Royal Air Force on 4 February and taken days later, with the British having defeated the last pockets of Dervish resistance.The Times, 18 February 1920, p. 9 and Illustrated London News and the Sphere, both of 17 April 1920 Among the casualties at Taleh were Ibrahim Buqul and Haji Sudi. The former was the commander of the Dervish at Taleh, and the latter was a long-standing member of the movement according to Douglas Jardin (1923) and Henry Rayne (1921). Another Dervish leader, Yusuf Xayle, was captured alive and later executed by former Dervish Abdi Dhere, who had defected to the opposition in 1919. Hassan himself managed to escape to the Ogaden, where his Dervishes were later routed in a 1921 raid led by the clan leader Haji Warabe.Douglas Jardine, 'The Mad Mullah of Somaliland.' 8vo. London 1923. =Taleh forts= Although the term Taleh or Taleex is often used to describe the entire Dervish fort complex in the town, it more strictly applies to only one of the structures in a four- part compound.

The ruins adjoin the west end of the village of Pevensey in East Sussex, England. The fort was built in the 290s and was abandoned after it was sacked in 471. It was re-inhabited by Saxons and in the 11th century the Normans built a castle within the east end of the fort. The site decayed to become the archetypal ruinous medieval castle, Pevensey Castle, which is surrounded by a small moat, large green -- and unusually substantial Roman defensive walls on three sides. During the Second World War, the Roman fort and medieval castle were adapted for modern warfare, and pillboxes were built into the Roman walls. Etymology The fort is named Anderidos or Anderitos, in the Notitia Dignitatum, and Anderida was formerly the most accepted form. This has been interpreted as a Latinized version of the Celtic ande- (an intensive prefix) and ritu- (British element meaning \\"a ford\\", as in the Modern Welsh rhyd and Cornish ryd), giving a translation of \\"Great Ford\\". Andred persisted as a name into the Saxon period, with the wooded area surrounding the fort becoming known as Andredes Weald, meaning \\"The Forest of Andred\\". As the original name was adopted into English, it is thought the Romano-British culture at Anderitum persisted in the forest after the Saxon occupation, and the Anglo Saxon Chronicle records \\"Wealas\\" (Welshmen, or Romanized Britons) in the woods..Eilert Ekwall, The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford, 1936, under \\"Weald\\" and \\"Andred\\"Medieval and Classical Literature Library, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Part 1 Location Anderida Portus, shown at the southern point of the Forest of Anderida The fort was built on what was then peninsula of land rising above the coastal marshes. The sea washed over what is now Pevensey Marshes surrounding Anderida on three sides, so giving a safe and sheltered landing point. This marshy inlet of the sea, extending inland as far as Hailsham, was studded with small areas of high land which remained as islands at high tide so later giving the place-names of Rickney, Horse Eye, North Eye and Pevensey derived from the Old English word ƒ´eg, island. Unlike at many other Roman forts, no civilian settlement or vicus appears to have been established outside its walls; this was probably because the fort was at the end of a peninsula with limited room for additional construction. Dating The fort's construction has been dated to around 290, based on the dating of wooden piles which were found underpinning the Roman walls in an excavation carried out in 1994. Other Saxon Shore forts were built or reconstructed around this time as part of a systematic programme of improvements to the coastal defences of Roman Britain. It is likely that Anderitum was built to defend Roman Britain from Rome itself. Carausius, a Roman general who commanded the Classis Britannica (the Roman fleet based in the English Channel), revolted against Rome in 286 and declared himself emperor of Britain and northern Gaul. He was assassinated in 293 by his treasurer, Allectus, who was himself killed in 296 when the Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus invaded Britain to overthrow the usurper. Coins of both Carausius and Allectus have been discovered buried in the foundations of the fort's walls. A later coin of 330‚Äì335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers (or breakaway rulers) had inherited an existing system of coastal defence ‚Äì the earlier Saxon Shore forts ‚Äì and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle). Anderitum appears to have been a key link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort. Construction Roman masonry in the walls of Anderitum It has been estimated that it took around 160,000 man-days to build the fort, equivalent to 285 men spending two years building it or 115 men over five years. At least four gangs of builders appear to have worked on the surviving sections of walls; each gang was given a stretch of about at a time to build but executed the work in significantly different styles, for instance using differing numbers of tiled bonding-courses or ironstone facing in particular places. This may simply indicate varying levels of availability of construction materials at the time each segment was built, leading the gangs to use whatever supplies were available at that moment. The amount of construction material required was very large, equating to about of stone and mortar. It is not known how it was transported to the site, but that volume of material would have needed some 600 boat loads or 49,000 wagon loads, requiring 250 wagons pulled by 1,500‚Äì2,000 oxen to move it from the quarries to Pevensey. Given the scale of the requirements for land transportation, it seems more likely that the raw materials were instead moved by sea, though even this would have been a significant operation; it has been estimated that 18 vessels would have been needed for a continuous supply operation carried out over a season of 280 days. The curtain wall was not all built at once but was constructed in segments, as can be seen from vertical breaks in the stonework which mark where sections met. The wall is built on top of complex foundations constructed from rubble and timber set into a ditch deep. Oak piles were driven into the trench and packed with flint and clay, above which a horizontal framework of oak beams was set with more flint and clay. The foundation was finally covered over with cement before the walls were built on top. Some of the timbers have survived, allowing archaeologists to date the fort through dendrochronology. Other dating evidence was discredited in the 1970s. An excavation in 1906‚Äì08 found shattered tiles stamped HON AUG ANDRIA, which were used to attribute Pevensey Castle's construction to the reign of the early 5th century Emperor Honorius. However, later use of thermoluminescence dating revealed they had been made around the time of the excavation. It is suspected that Charles Dawson, who has been blamed for the Piltdown Man hoax, was the author of the forged tiles. Garrison Anderitum is recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum as the base of the praepositus numeri Abulcorum ‚Äì an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection with the field army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that they were an elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably in the form of a single detachment, at Anderitum. They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or perhaps even a single band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were recorded in the Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts. Post-Roman era Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain, local civilians took over the fort, and the Latinized Celtic name continued to be used well into the Saxon period. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that the Saxons \\"besieged Andredes ceaster and drove the population into The Weald, which continued to be distinctly Romano-British and was known as the \\"Andred'sley\\" or \\"Andreds Weald\\":\\" This event is now thought to have happened around 471 rather than the date recorded by the Chronicle (due to a dating error by Gildas, on whose work the Chronicle draws). It is uncertain whether British or Saxon habitation of the fort continued after this event, but the fort appears to have been resettled by about the middle of the 6th century by a Saxon community which left evidence of its occupation in the shape of pottery, glass and other items. By the late Anglo-Saxon period, Pevensey had become a well-established fishing port and producer of salt. Later castle When William the Conqueror launched his invasion of England by landing at Pevensey Bay on 28 September 1066, his army sheltered for the night in a temporary fortification within the old Roman fort. The army left for Hastings the following day, en route to the Battle of Hastings. It was converted into a castle around 1100. Occupation continued until the Elizabethan era.

It was part of a major land-based thoroughfare in pioneer times linking fledgling Portland with the pre-territorial government at Champoeg, and later Salem. It was eventually made obsolete by the Boone Bridge on Interstate 5.  History  The ferry was built by the family of Alphonso Boone (grandson of Daniel Boone) who, in 1846, claimed on and around present day Charbonneau which was on the main road between Oregon City and present day Butteville.The Oregon.com reference says they homesteaded, but that was not possible until 1862. The Land Donation Claim Act applied to land claimed before 1850. The family cleared a path and laid a split log roadway north to Portland and south toward Salem. The ferry was propelled by oarsmen from the nearby Tuality Indian tribe. Alphonso was adamant about operating the ferry 24 hours a day. When word of the California gold rush reached the area in 1848, Alphonso and his sons headed south. Alphonso died either February 1, 1850, or February 27, 1850, in the gold fields of a miner's disease, but his sons returned with their fortunes. Initially Alphonso, Jr. operated the ferry, but soon sold it to his brother Jesse, who operated it until his death in 1872 at the hand of a neighbor over a river access dispute. Afterward, the ferry was owned and operated by several people for a few years, before it passed to Clackamas County. By the early 1900s, the State of Oregon controlled it. Shortly after the establishment of Boones Ferry, the community of Boones Landing was established and quickly grew. It was the precursor of Wilsonville. The completion of the Baldock Freeway Bridge (now Boone Bridge) in 1954 resulted in decommissioning of the ferry, which made up to 300 trips per day, carrying up to 12 autos at a time. Many sections of the road are still in use and named Boones Ferry Road, which closely parallels contemporary Interstate 5. Today, at the end of one of the road fragments on the north shore is Boones Ferry Park, in Wilsonville, located where one terminal was; the south shore has a marina with a boat ramp in approximately the historical location of the other terminal. The ferry crossing site is about 2000 ft (600 m) west of I-5 and is visible from the southbound lanes of the Boone Bridge.

It is located in Taft Street, Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Philippines. Established in 1905, it is the oldest public secondary level school in Cagayan and the province's premier secondary school. The school, which is administered by the Department of Education, has around 5,000 students. Its campus is fenced and gated, although some buildings outside the walls of the school are being used because of the great number of students. This is the biggest secondary school in Cagayan Valley. Cagayan National High School was nationalized, from Cagayan High School, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1050 on July 1, 1976. Cagayan National High School, like standard Public National High Schools in the Philippines, section their students according to the entrance exam scores taken before the students' first year. Students who identify themselves as (1) a passer of the Philippine Science High School National Competitive Examination (PSHS-NCE) or (2) an elementary school class valedictorian is exempted in taking the entrance exam but are required to submit proofs for validation. History The Main Building, commonly known as the Gabaldon Building, is the oldest edifice in the campus. It houses classrooms and the Conference Hall or the Old Library.With the Thomasites as organizers, the Cagayan High School was formally opened in June 1905 with Albrow S. Burnell as its first principal. It was housed in Otto Weber's residence which was later on bought by the government for its first school building. The school was situated on 16.5 hectares of land which was purchased by the provincial board of Cagayan under Governor Gracio Gonzaga. Meanwhile, to solve the problem on teacher shortage, the school, which was at the same time a teacher training institution, offered Domestic Science in 1918 and a Secondary Normal Course in 1921. Then in February 1922, District Engineer Salesby laid the cornerstone of the new Cagayan High School building at its present site which was completed and inaugurated after a year. After more than two decades, the American line- up of school administrators ended and Demetrio M. Andres, a native of Marikina, became the first Filipino principal of the school in 1931. During his term, post-graduate normal course was opened to meet the demand for elementary school teachers. However, in March 1937, the last group of secondary normal senior students graduated and for the first time, two valedictorians were proclaimed - one for the general course and one for the normal course. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the school was forced to close for three years. Nevertheless, in September 1945, the school was reopened with a handful of teachers, holding classes in the bomb-shattered building. In July 1948, regular publication of The Cagayan Students' Chronicle which is the school organ of the Cagayan National High School up to this day, was resumed. In 1967 to 1972, the school was one of the ten pilot high schools in the country in teaching secondary English as a second language. As such, it was a regional center for the five-year English program. The school year 1974‚Äì1975 started the implementation of the Revised Secondary Curriculum Program 1973 which is the present curriculum. Cagayan National High School witnessed a significant milestone in its history following its nationalization by virtue of Presidential Decree 1050 on July 1, 1976. Its principal then, Conrado I. Bacuyag, was the principal author of its nationalization. To this day, the Cagayan National High School is ever-glowing with her remarkable feat and records in competitions.Cagayan National High School Diamond Jubilee Souvenir Program Curricula =Junior High School= There are three curricula offered: the Restructured Basic Education Curriculum (RBEC) is for the majority of the students.

The program was created and hosted by NBC staff announcer Gene Hamilton, as a tongue-in-cheek satire of highbrow symphonic broadcasts hosted by Milton Cross. Instead of Cross's dignified commentary introducing each orchestral selection, \\"Dr. Gino Hamilton\\" would introduce a traditional hot jazz (Dixieland) melody, peppering his remarks with slang. The music was performed by two house bands. Henry Levine, a former member of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, led an eight-member dixieland combo; Paul Laval led a 10-piece woodwind ensemble, with arrangements employing oboe, bassoon, and French horn. Each broadcast featured a vocalist: Dinah Shore was discovered on the Basin Street program; she was succeeded in turn by New York-based vocalists Diane Courtney, Dodie O'Neill, Dixie Mason, Linda Keene, Loulie Jean Norman, and Lena Horne. Gene Hamilton invited guest artists to appear on Basin Street, including Benny Goodman, Count Basie, W. C. Handy, Bobby Hackett, Leadbelly, Lionel Hampton, Jelly Roll Morton, Sidney Bechet, and Alec Templeton, among many other famous names in the jazz world. The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street began as a sustaining (unsponsored) half-hour feature on NBC's Sunday-afternoon schedule (4:30 p.m. Eastern time). So many listeners wrote to the network expressing approval -- and asking to see the show in person -- that in October 1940 NBC gave Basin Street a Monday-evening slot in its primetime schedule. Hamilton was forced to leave the program in late 1941, when NBC reassigned him to its production department. He was replaced as host by announcer Jack McCarthy and then by the very man the series was burlesquing, Milton Cross. The show was canceled in 1944. NBC returned Basin Street to its schedule on June 8, 1950, with Hamilton returning to the microphone, as a summer replacement for Judy Canova's program. Basin Street was revived as a Saturday-night series during the summer of 1952, with Henry Levine's band and a new host, 23-year-old nightclub comedian Orson Bean. Bean caught the spirit of the series immediately, and read the scripted remarks in the bemused tones of a stuffy college professor. NBC staff announcer Wayne Howell, in the same spirit, introduced the host as \\"Boston's half-baked Bean.\\" Recordings and films Beginning in November 1940, RCA Victor recorded albums featuring The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street. The liner notes were written by Welbourne (Web) Kelley, who wrote the radio series. Each disc in the album would begin with \\"Dr. Gino\\" Hamilton introducing the selection, played by one of the two Basin Street bands. The other side of the disc featured the other band. RCA re-released these records as late as the 1960s, emphasizing vocalists Dinah Shore or Lena Horne and deleting the commentaries. The only surviving visual records of The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street are four three-minute films produced for the Soundies film jukeboxes in 1941. All feature the Henry Levine \\"Dixieland Jazz Band,\\" with vocals by Linda Keene in three of them.Scott MacGillivray and Ted Okuda, The Soundies Book: A Revised and Expanded Guide, iUniverse, 2007. .

Gartner (born 1935) is the founder of Gartner, Inc. (formerly Gartner Group Inc. until 2001) a Stamford, Connecticut information technology (IT) research and advisory company.  Early life and education  Gartner was born in Mandatory Palestine in 1935 and grew up in New York City. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He graduated from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1960 with a Master's degree.Gideon I. Gartner, Oral history interview by Jeffrey R. Yost, 12 August 2005, Aspen, Colorado. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis  Early career  Gartner began his career in the computer business. At IBM, he was Manager of Market Information in its Data Processing Division, and Systems Engineering Manager and Systems Engineer in IBM World Trade Corporation. He also worked for Philco Corporation in its Computer Division, and for System Development Corporation, working on two U.S. government large system contracts: SACCS (Strategic Air Command and Control System), and DCA (Defense Communication Agency Control System).  IT industry information businesses  In the years leading up to the formation of Gartner Group, Gartner was a partner at Oppenheimer & Co. He was voted the top individual technology analyst on Wall Street between the years 1972 and 1977 inclusive, in the annual poll of major banks, funds, and other institutional investing firms, published by Institutional Investor Magazine.II Magazine Americas = Gartner Group = He founded Gartner Group (now called Gartner, Inc.) in 1979, and served as its CEO and Chairman through April 1991. IT \\"advisory\\" firms are distinct from consultancies, in that they provide \\"continuous\\" advice to clients - defined in renewable (but open-ended) contracts which typically include a mix of \\"deliverables\\" including (but not limited to) content; client interaction with analysts and/or experts; and events. \\"Gartner Group became the preferred place a corporate client went when it had any question about the IT industry,\\" noted one staffer.Catherine Fredman, About Gartner: The Making of a Billion-Dollar IT Advisory Firm (Lemonade Heroes, 2014), p. 137. In 1979, the primary \\"advisory\\" firms in Information Technology (IT) were IDC (International Data Corporation, part of IDG), Dataquest (now part of Gartner), and Yankee Group. Gartner's innovations, which were aimed at creating an advisory model which would address the evolving and complex needs of IT professionals and firms, included: #Selling to multiple constituencies #Financing #Nationwide sales organization #Sales measurement and compensation model #Peer-level advisors #Broad focus #Research process and organizational culture = Selling to multiple constituencies = At the time, other advisory firms usually sold to only computer hardware, software, and services vendors. Exceptions at that time included Dataquest (selling a service for investors), and Input Corp. (selling a service for users). Gartner sold to vendors, plus users (generally large enterprises and other organizations, such as government agencies), plus investors and consulting firms. Investors were among the first targets, as Gartner had just resigned as partner of Oppenheimer & Co., but at Oppenheimer he had also begun servicing a group of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of large corporations, which became the base for Gartner's enterprise activities. As Gartner Group's coverage of IBM was deep (IBM was the primary industry vendor at the time), other vendors desired to be tied into Gartner‚Äôs research network. Thus, the market Gartner addressed was unusually broad, and each constituency provided insights and information which benefitted others, arguably creating market advantage. = Financing = Gartner's venture capital financing was unique among advisory firms at the time. Gartner Group was initially financed by Bessemer Venture Partners and E.M. Warburg Pincus, with Bank Paribas joining a year later. This led to the firm being the first in its field to raise public capital in a 1986 offering, supporting its growth. = Nationwide sales organization = Raising capital from venture firms allowed Gartner to build a nationwide sales organization, the first of its kind in the industry. = Sales measurement and compensation model = Gartner instituted a sales measurement and compensation scheme, based upon how IBM had measured its rental sales, but novel when applied to consulting/advisory firms: since Gartner Group sold annual renewable contracts and recorded \\"Contract Value\\", it based progress reporting and compensation (commission for sales personnel and bonus for analysts and managers), on the growth of appropriate Contract Value (CV) during a period of time; this was called Net Contract Value Increase (NCVI). Uniquely, compared with all prior consulting and advisory models, all variable compensation was based upon growth and not on revenue from renewals, an important factor in developing a strong growth culture. = Peer-level advisors = Having come from Wall Street, Gartner adopted the idea of employing senior industry people, who were in fact \\"peers\\" of their prospective clients. This was a departure from the current industry practice at the time, where analysts were relatively young and relatively inexperienced albeit bright. = Broad focus = Instead of focusing primarily on market research, Gartner emphasized a basket of \\"values\\" including : G2 (competitive intelligence and analysis), quantitative methods for clients to analyze residual values and obsolescence metrics of IT hardware, saving money within the IT organization, and IT education within clients‚Äô staffs. = Research process and organizational culture = Gartner developed a disciplined \\"research process\\", which was documented in a Research Notebook, used in regular training programs at the firm. Process highlights called for analysts to \\"scan\\" all sources of input, be trained in recognizing \\"patterns\\", develop \\"new ideas\\" from these patterns, and \\"document\\" the results in brief one-page \\"research notes\\". General industry practice at the time was to publish relatively long reports. Gartner research \\"gimmicks\\" were introduced, such as the \\"stalking horse\\", a research collaborative tool whereby analysts were compelled to graphically present and defend their logic at research meetings. Thus, the \\"horse\\" became the company mascot. Intensive research meetings for all researchers were conducted at least weekly, and provided additional training and other benefits. Other innovations were introduced, in areas such as research-hiring interview methods, conferences including the breakthrough Symposium, inquiry systems to connect clients with internal analysts. All the above contributed to an unusually strong and acknowledged organizational culture.The Vital Corporation - Chapter 2 = Growth = Gartner Group was ranked among the fastest growing private firms in the U.S. (by Inc. Magazine) until it went public in 1986, whereupon it was listed for several years among the best small companies in America (by Business Week, e.g. #9 overall, and #1 in profitability, in 1987). Gartner was sold to Saatchi & Saatchi in 1988, and Gartner signed a contract to remain as CEO until April 1991. In 1990, Gartner led a successful leveraged buyout of the firm financed by Information Partners, a private equity fund owned by Bain Capital and Dun & Bradstreet. Gartner Group is generally recognized as the world's leading \\"advisory consulting\\" firm in the IT industries, based on annual revenues and market share.  Soundview Technologies  Gartner, who had retained contact with his Wall Street clients, initiated a new financial service for Gartner Group via a new partnership with Dillon, Read & Co., which distributed its reports and personal services to Dillon, Read & Co. investment client organizations. Gartner Group severed the Dillon Read relationship and became an independent broker-dealer in 1984, named Gartner Securities Corp., and spun this business out to its shareholders just before its first public offering in 1986, providing its analysis, investment advice and banking services, to all institutional investors. Its name was changed in 1988 to SoundView Technology Group, when Gartner was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi. Soundview was unique in that it combined accepted Wall Street research and distribution methods, with the intimate (albeit \\"arms length\\") relationship with Gartner analysts, and arguably became the leading technology research boutique on Wall Street. But it merged in 2000 with Wit Capital, and was eventually sold (early 2004) to Charles Schwab & Co., and thereafter completely absorbed into Schwab and UBS.  GiGa Information Group  Giga Information Group was founded by Gartner in 1995. He raised more than $15 million in several tranches to develop the company; he was Chairman and CEO until late 1999. In less than four years from first shipment (April 1, 1996 to December 1999), this innovative firm became the fastest growing technology advisory consulting company in history, generating a run rate from zero to over $65 million, with more than 1,200 enterprise clients. Three primary innovations were introduced to the advisory business through Giga:403 Forbidden its offering of a single comprehensive IT Advisory service (compared with the typical multiple services of other advisory firms), an external cadre of experts to supplement the strategic nature of analysts on staff, and a set of web functions which stressed objectivity of analysis, and allowed on-line research by clients (called ‚ÄúThe Knowledge Salon‚Äù). Giga went public in 1998, but its stock languished during and after the technology stock market meltdown of 2000. In February 2003 the company was sold to Forrester Research.  Personal life  Gartner lives in Aspen, Colorado and Stamford, Connecticut, and is involved in business ventures, athletics, and classical music. His music background includes a lifetime of piano practice, as well as performing on the French Horn, having been a member of the London School Symphony Orchestra, and the Brooklyn Philharmonic (then called the Brooklyn Philharmonia). He is on the board of the Opera Orchestra of N.Y, is a trustee of the Music Associates of Aspen (the Aspen Music Festival and School), is a fellow of the Aspen Institute, and is on the National Councils or equivalent, of the Aspen Art Museum, and the Anderson Ranch. He has served on the Library Committee of the M.I.T. Corporation and is a Sustaining Fellow Life Member of M.I.T. He is a past member of the board of the Society for Information Management where he was Special Appointee to the President. He is a Director's Circle member of the Charles Babbage Institute and a member of the Board of Directors of the IT History Society. In the 1977 joint exhibit sponsored by the ACM and Goldman Sachs in Washington D.C. and the Boston Computer Museum, documented in the book ‚ÄúWizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing‚Äù, Gartner was honored as one of the 19 ‚ÄúCommunicator‚Äù stars in the IT industry. Gartner's professional activities have included speaking before major organizations worldwide. He has addressed graduate student groups at Harvard Business School, M.I.T., Yale, University of Georgia, and Arizona State, among others. In 1985, Gartner taught a course at UCLA‚Äôs Graduate School of Management (GSM), which was formally rated by his students as their best course taken throughout GSM. Gartner has also written extensively, for example, the AMA journal, series of articles for Computer Decisions and Information Week magazines, and the forward and much of Chapter 7, in ‚ÄúThe E-Marketplace‚Ä¶Strategies for success in B2B eCommerce‚Äù, by Warren Raisch (McGraw Hill, 2001). He is an active angel investor in early-stage companies, and is a member of New York Angels.  Notes   Sources  * Gartner Inc. annual reports * Gideon I. Gartner, Oral history interview by Jeffrey R.

Biography The Ignaz Lieben Prize has been called the Austrian Nobel Prize. It is similar in intent but somewhat older than the Nobel Prize. The Austrian merchant Ignaz L. Lieben, whose family supported many philanthropic activities, had stipulated in his testament that 6,000 florins should be used ‚Äúfor the common good‚Äù. In 1863 this money was given to the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences, and the Ignaz L. Lieben Prize was instituted. Every three years, the sum of 900 florins was to be given to an Austrian scientist in the field of chemistry, physics, or physiology. This sum corresponded to roughly 40 per cent of the annual income of a university professor. From 1900 on, the prize was offered on a yearly basis. The endowment was twice increased by the Lieben family. When the endowment had lost its value due to inflation after World War I, the family transferred the necessary sum yearly to the Austrian Academy of Sciences. But since the family was persecuted by the National Socialists, the prize was discontinued after the German Anschluss of Austria in 1938. Richard Lieben (1842‚Äì1919), the younger son of Ignaz Lieben, financed the Richard Lieben Prize in Mathematics, which was awarded every three years from 1912 to 1921, and one final time in 1928, before being discontinued. In 2004 the Lieben prize was reinstated, with support from Isabel Bader and Alfred Bader (who was able to flee from Austria to Great Britain at the age of fourteen in 1938). Now, the award amounts to US Dollar 36,000, and it is offered yearly to young scientists who work in Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia or Slovenia (i.e., in one of the countries that were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire a hundred years ago), and who work in the fields of molecular biology, chemistry, or physics.

He is portrayed by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. In a two- part 2010 episode, the actor Kasey Campbell played a teenage Kevin in flashback sequences set in 1986. Rhys is the second actor to appear in all the episodes of the series. His relationship with Scotty Wandell was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time. Character history =Background= Kevin, born April 18, 1972, was the fourth child of William and Nora Walker (the siblings are, in birth order, Sarah, Kitty, Tommy, Kevin, and Justin). Kevin's first sexual experience was with a girl, Sarah Gimble, but by the next summer he had sex with a boy, Tucker Booth, at his family's ranch house (Tucker also took Sarah's virginity and was the first person to do drugs with Justin, but Kevin likely knew none of this). When Kevin was a senior in high school, he began seeing a boy named Danny G. McCullough. Danny's sister found out about the relationship and told Kitty. Kevin swore Kitty to secrecy, but by that Christmas she had told the other siblings. Kevin then told his mother, and she quickly joined PFLAG. Years later, Kevin would express some bitterness at how this had unfolded, saying he had felt like \\"an exchange student in his own home.\\" He also reveals a crush he had on fellow student Matthew Brown; he joined everything Brown joined from Future Farmers of America (Brown apparently grew a prize-winning pumpkin) to the golf team. Kevin eventually became a successful lawyer, but failed to make partner. He was out to his family as well as to the legal world, but struggled with romantic relationships. Several years before the start of the show, Kevin was in a relationship with another man which ended with enough regret that Kevin kept a framed photo of the two of them in his office. Kevin also implied that in his past, he had had problems staying faithful in a relationship and slept around with other random men at times. =Kevin and Scotty= Along with the rest of the Walker family, Kevin's world was shaken when his father William suddenly died and was revealed as an embezzler and an adulterer. A heavy burden was often put on Kevin's shoulders, as he was the executor of his father's estate and his siblings also came to him for legal advice when they found out William had embezzled money from the company pension fund. Kevin, used to this role, offered few complaints, and seemed uninterested in a romantic relationship. While working on a case, Kevin interviewed a key witness, Scotty Wandell (Luke Macfarlane). Scotty, who was more flamboyant than Kevin, quickly deduced Kevin's homosexuality and accused him of being ashamed and trying to \\"pass\\" for heterosexual. Kevin was irritated by Scotty's insinuations, but after Sarah invited Scotty to the Walker home for a pool party, Kevin began to let his guard down. He made a date with Scotty, but had to cancel when his mother Nora guilted him into accompanying her to a golf tournament. She changed her mind during the tournament and they went to the movies instead, where they ran into Scotty and a male companion holding hands. Later, Kevin confronted his mother for using him instead of allowing him to live his own life. Soon after their run-in at the movies, Scotty dropped by Kevin's office and assured him the other man was only a friend. Kevin and Scotty went on their first date and bonded while talking about their backgrounds. When Scotty impulsively kissed Kevin during the meal, Kevin was put off. After they left the restaurant and Kevin remained distant, Scotty confronted Kevin about his shame of public displays of affection, putting down Kevin for his \\"internalized homophobia.\\" Kevin insisted he was fine with himself and would object to the public kiss even if he were straight. The date ended on a sour note, but the next day, Scotty dropped by Kevin's apartment to apologize for being judgmental and to tell Kevin how much he got to Scotty. Kevin expressed relief that Scotty wasn't perfect and kissed him in front of a neighbor. After jokingly slamming the door in his face, Kevin pulled Scotty inside the apartment in order to take their relationship further. When Scotty was unable to get off work to attend a charity benefit with Kevin, Kevin offered to pay Scotty's salary for the time he would miss. Scotty bristled at the idea of being \\"bought\\" by Kevin, and felt he was being made to feel inferior due to his social status. Coincidentally, Scotty turned out to be a waiter at the benefit. When a drunk Kevin apologized to him, they kissed and made up, but Scotty's boss fired him for putting his personal life before the job. Kevin threatened the boss with an anti-discrimination lawsuit unless he agreed to rehire Scotty, with a bigger salary. Kevin and Scotty made up. When Kevin found out the family ranch house was about to be sold, he and Scotty decided to go for a weekend visit, not realizing the rest of his family had had the same idea. During the weekend, Kevin's brother Tommy, who had recently discovered his sterility, asked Kevin for his sperm in order to father a child with Tommy's wife Julia. Kevin turned him down. When Sarah found out she angrily confronted Kevin at the dinner table, and asked Scotty for his opinion. Kevin unthinkingly snapped that Scotty was not family and he should \\"shut up\\". He quickly apologized, but a hurt Scotty went home. Kevin confided to Kitty that he didn't want to bring a child into the world because he was afraid the child would be considered different for having a gay uncle and biological father, and face the kind of suffering he had faced. Kitty assured him the Walkers would never let anyone hurt the child, and Kevin (along with their other brother, Justin) agreed to be a sperm donor for Tommy and Julia. When Kevin got back to town, Scotty would no longer return his calls. Scotty dropped by the office to accept a settlement check, and Kevin joked that Scotty could take him to dinner since he was now on Kevin's financial level. A hurt Scotty said it had taken him a long time to accept himself, and in only two months, Kevin had made him feel worthless. He then told Kevin to rip up the check. Soon after, Kevin called Scotty and finally put his heart on the line. Scotty asked him for the check, and thanked him for the time they had spent together, but said the relationship was over. Kevin barely held his tears at bay as he ended the conversation. Later events would have them reconnect (see below). They got engaged and Scotty's parents refused to go to the wedding. Scotty said he was ok with it, but Kevin felt bad, so his brothers talked him into going on a 5-hour road trip to talk to Scotty's parents and convince them to go. =Falling Out with Kitty= After Kevin joined Tommy and Sarah on a road trip to track down the missing pension fund, their car broke down and they were stranded at a military bar. A soldier who flirted with Kevin at the bar agreed to let them stay at his place, and he had a one-night stand with Kevin in the process. They soon found the money their father had hidden away, and the family business was saved. The family harmony was strained when Kevin found out that Kitty was going to work for a senator (Rob Lowe) who had voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In the process, Kevin realized Kitty herself was opposed to gay marriage, although she supported civil unions. A stung Kevin grudgingly accepted her decision, but was infuriated when Kitty began seeing the senator socially. As a result, Kevin and Kitty became somewhat estranged for a time. =Kevin and Chad= Chad Barry (Jason Lewis), a handsome soap star, made the moves on Kevin. Even though Chad was closeted and had a girlfriend, a starstruck Kevin began a secret affair with Chad. In spite of his better judgment, Kevin developed feelings for Chad, telling Chad this was the first time he was the one who wanted the relationship more. When Kevin realized their relationship was never going to be more than a secret affair, he tried to end things, but Chad gave him an expensive watch and convinced Kevin he had feelings for him. Chad's girlfriend, Michelle, fixed Kevin up for a blind date. The date turned out to be Scotty, to the surprise of both men. Due to being jealous of Chad and Michelle, as well as still having strong feelings for Scotty, Kevin had sex with Scotty. The morning after, Chad called Kevin and asked if he'd had sex with Scotty. When Kevin implied he had, Chad claimed he would have broken up with Michelle but no longer had a reason to do so. Scotty, who overheard the conversation, asked Kevin if he'd slept with him to make Chad jealous. Kevin replied, \\"I don't know.\\" A hurt Scotty said Kevin was now in the place he had been in with Kevin - loving someone who doesn't love themselves. He told Kevin he felt sorry for him, and sadly wished him good luck. Although Chad was upset with Kevin, Chad soon began calling him again and asking him for another chance. Kevin was uninterested until Chad told him he'd broken up with Michelle. Kevin and Chad went out to dinner. After dinner, Michelle called Kevin to warn him that Chad was stringing him along and would hurt him the way he'd hurt other men and women. Kevin continued to be wary of Chad, but Chad convinced him of his desire for a real relationship. A blogger, Dan Silk, began running stories on his site which exposed Chad's homosexuality (one being Kevin and Chad shopping for a lamp). Against Chad's wishes, Kevin called Silk and threatened him with a lawsuit. Silk responded by increasing his attacks against Chad. Chad told Kevin they would now have to be even more discreet and hidden away than before. Meanwhile, Kevin, Sarah, Tommy, and Saul decided not to tell Nora (Kevin's mother) that William (Kevin's father) had a long-lost daughter, Rebecca, by another woman, and that daughter was now back in town. Feeling guilty, Saul told Nora the truth, and the Walkers struggled with how to deal with their new addition. At a family dinner for Rebecca, Kevin, skeptical as to whether or not she was really their sister, yanked a hair out of her head at the dinner table, causing her to flee the house. In his relationship with Chad, he almost convinced Chad to come out, but Chad's manager told him if Chad came out, Chad would totally depend on him and constantly cling to him, and Chad's career would be ruined. Kevin, wary of being too attached to Chad, convinced him not to come out. Shortly afterwards, Chad did come out, but no longer wanted to be in a relationship with Kevin. =Kevin and the McCallisters= While Kitty was working on her boyfriend Senator Robert McCallister's Presidential campaign, Kitty met his brother, Jason (Eric Winter). Kitty thought he was attractive, smart, and witty and a good match for Kevin, and set them up for a date. Due to Kevin's antipathy towards Senator McCallister (due to his party status and views upon gay marriage), Kitty opted not to tell Kevin that Jason was Robert's brother. The two men had a good time on their date until Kevin began insulting Robert. Jason soon became offended and made up an excuse to leave early. When Kevin found out what Kitty had done, he was furious, but when she asked him for help, he used his legal expertise to stop a man who told her he planned to blackmail Robert over something he'd done while serving in the Persian Gulf War. At the end of the season, Kevin met up with Jason again when they had to plan Kitty's and Robert's engagement party. After a few drinks and some banter, they made out in the pantry. To Kevin's shock, not long after the kiss he found out Jason was an ordained Methodist minister. As the party wound down, Jason told Kevin he was a traditional person. While Kevin was not entirely sure how he felt about Jason or the situation, he replied that he could use some tradition in his life. At the start of the second season, it was indicated that Kevin and Jason were involved in a relationship. It was also announced that Jason would be leaving for Malaysia to serve as \\"missionary\\" for the impoverished people. While both Kevin and Jason told and shared their love and affections for each other, it was implied that their relationship would undergo some emotional strain. This marks a significance in Kevin Walker, as this is the first boyfriend that he has professed a love for, though it was not his first love declaration: his ex-boyfriend Scotty professed a love for him early on as did his ex-boyfriend Chad Barry. =Scotty Returns= While Kevin waited for Jason to return, he spent his time helping Sarah with her messy divorce and Justin with his painful recovery from war wounds. He was surprised when old flame Scotty showed up at his office for legal help. Scotty had been arrested for DUI and felt he was only charged because the arresting officer had a problem with his homosexuality. Kevin managed to have the case dismissed. (And get the officer who wrote the ticket reprimanded for discrimination.) As a thank you present, Scotty treated Kevin to a private dinner at the fancy restaurant where he worked as a cook. After the meal, Scotty nearly kissed Kevin before he stopped himself. Kevin somewhat nervously said that he had a boyfriend now. Scotty took this to mean that Kevin really had changed. Kevin left, but later returned to tell Scotty that they'd never had the chance to be friends, and he very much wanted to be Scotty's friend. Scotty was in the middle of a busy service, but told Kevin that was fine with him. When his tuition fee was due, Scotty could no longer afford his apartment, cell phone and insurance. Kevin invited Scotty to live with him. In the meantime, Kevin had not been talking to Jason for quite a while because Jason did not respond to Kevin's calls. Kevin felt emotionally lonely and also realized he still loved Scotty. One night, after a meal and champagne, he and Scotty slept together. A few days later, he finally got a call from Jason. He told Jason he had slept with Scotty and then broke up with Jason. When Jason returned to town, he told Kevin he'd undergone a spiritual crisis and could not bring himself to call. Scotty arranged a meal between the three of them which turned tense. After a quarrel, Jason left, and Scotty moved into his car, as he assumed Kevin no longer wanted him around. The next morning, Kevin convinced him he wanted to continue the relationship. =Proposal and Children= When Scotty cut himself badly and incurred large expenses because he had no health insurance, Kevin suggested they enter a domestic partnership so Scotty could share his coverage. Scotty, stung that Kevin only cared about practicality, rejected the idea. Kevin had to help his various relatives through their complicated personal and professional crises. His uncle Saul called him for help after he drunkenly drove his car into a tree. Kevin and Saul had fallen out some months earlier because Kevin suspected Saul was gay (Scotty had seen him at gay dinner party he'd catered) but Saul had vehemently denied it. After Kevin picked him up, Saul despondently asked Kevin how a man Saul's age could deal with being gay. Kevin said it was difficult even at his own age. The loneliness of Saul's life led Kevin to realize just how special his relationship with Scotty was. When he returned home, he proposed marriage (domestic partnership) to Scotty, even getting down on one knee. Scotty, moved by Kevin's words, happily said yes. As of the second season finale they are married. In season 4, they decide to have children and ask Michelle to be their surrogate. After one failure, it is revealed in the finale that the second attempt worked. In season 5, we learn that Michelle had a miscarriage. At that point, Kevin and Scotty's marriage is nearly ruined when Kevin discovers that Scotty cheated on him, and because Kevin is having a very hard time with Robert's death. They put their desire for children on hold, until they reconcile and decide to adopt through the foster system. They meet 9-year-old Olivia at an adoption event, and she pretty much chooses them. After a rough start (and Olivia's brother coming back), they adopt her. Scotty then stumbles upon Michelle, who reacts oddly, and later they find out that she has a child, Daniel, and realize that she lied about her miscarriage. She eventually drops him off at Justin's, making Kevin and Scotty a family of 4. Olivia doesn't take it well at first, but all is well in the finale. Significance as a character Although American network television had gay and lesbian characters in both daytime and prime time, many of those characters only made guest appearances, were minor in importance, or received little storyline beyond coming out or other struggles related to their sexuality. Kevin was the rare gay character who was already out both to his family and in the workplace. The stated goal of the show to treat Kevin as an equal to, no better or worse than, the straight charactersWhere Are We? Where Do We Go? TV Guide received praise from critics such as Robert Bianco.ABC's 'Brothers' shows signs of maturing USA Today Kisses between men had been especially rare on network television; Melrose Place edited out a gay kiss, Dawson's Creek had a few small kisses every few seasons, Will & Grace (a show with two gay characters in major roles) was the rare exception and featured both gay kisses and relationships throughout its eight-year run, and thirtysomething faced loss of ad revenues due to airing a scene of two men lying in bed together.Is a Gay Kiss on TV Finally Just a Kiss? AfterElton Desperate Housewives, which precedes Brothers & Sisters on ABC, previously featured kisses and bedroom scenes involving Bree's gay son Andrew. In the first season of Brothers & Sisters, Kevin had a number of kisses with his love interests, even kissing Scotty twice in the same episode (\\"Date Night\\"), and shared several bedroom scenes with Chad that clearly took place soon after sex. The lack of noticeable backlash from viewers or advertisers was hailed as a positive step in public acceptance of gay characters. Kevin's commitment ceremony with Scotty, likewise, was only the ninth same-sex wedding ceremony ever presented on an American network television series, and the first one ever between series regulars.\\"Top This: A Gay Ceremony on ABC's Brothers & Sisters, USA Today, May 11, 2008.

He served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1990 until 1996 and as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1999 to 2007. Newell was born in Sydney, received a Diploma of Applied Science from the Hawkesbury Agricultural College and a Diploma of Education from the Armidale College of Advanced Education, now part of the University of New England. He was a teacher in the Riverina and Lismore before running for Parliament. In 1990, Newell was preselected as the Australian Labor Party candidate for Richmond, a historically rural seat in northern New South Wales. The seat was held by the leader of the National Party, Charles Blunt. Newell was initially given little chance of winning, since he was running in what had historically been a strongly conservative seat. It had been in the hands of the non-Labor parties since Federation, and the Nationals had held it without interruption since 1922 though their margin had been declining in recent years. In the election, Newell only won 27 percent of the first preference vote. However, on the seventh count, anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Newell, allowing him to defeat Blunt and become the first Labor member ever to win Richmond. Newell was only the second person to defeat a major federal party leader in an election. He was reelected in 1993 over the Nationals' Larry Anthony, but was defeated by Anthony in 1996. Newell tried to regain his old seat in 1998, but narrowly lost. He subsequently won the state seat of Tweed from the National Party in 1999, but was defeated by National candidate Geoff Provest in 2007.

It is widely considered to be the band's most popular single, reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Composition The song's angst-driven lyrics deal with a lack of confidence and frustration which is strongly reflected in the overall performance. Like many of Local H's songs, the guitar tuning is a half step down from standard. The song is noteworthy for the usage of the word \\"copacetic\\" in the chorus. A music video was produced for \\"Bound for the Floor,\\" which features a performance by the band strung with shots of a school building. The video also features children playing and following the band, perhaps a representation of groupies, where they follow them to a \\"merry go round\\", then to a bar, and finally to a private concert. While the video is playing it cuts to the children occasionally writing the lyric to the song as it's sung, or the video cuts to the band playing in an abandoned building. Clear Channel included the song on its 2001 Clear Channel memorandum due to the song's lyric. In popular culture \\"Bound for the Floor\\" was featured in the 2006 film Big Nothing, starring Simon Pegg and David Schwimmer, as well as in the Xbox 360 video game Saints Row.

It is a tall shrub or tree to about 15 m (50 ft) in height with finely divided bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that appear over summer. It generally grows in woodland or dry sclerophyll forest on alluvial or shale- based soils, generally with some clay content. A fast-growing plant, it regenerates after bushfire by seed or suckering and can quickly colonise disturbed areas. Likewise it adapts readily to cultivation and is used in revegetation projects. Description habit Growing with an upright habit, Acacia parramattensis is a tall shrub or tree ranging from in height with smooth bark that can be dark green, dark brown or black. The branchlets are more or less terete (round in cross-section), sometimes with ridges. The tips of new growth are yellow and finely furry becoming smooth with age. The dark green and slightly rough leaves are joined to the stem by a long petiole and are finely divided or bipinnate‚Äîthat is, each leaf has 3‚Äì16 pairs of long pinnae (leaflets) arising from it, and each of these pinnae has anywhere from 14 to 62 (most commonly 20 to 40) pairs of pinnules off it. Each pinnule is 2 to 7 (rarely 9) mm long and 0.5‚Äì1 mm wide and linear or cultrate in shape. The yellow flowers appear from November to February, occasionally as late as April. The yellow flowers are spherical and measure in diameter. they are arranged in panicles or racemes, with 25 to 50 flowers occurring in each flower head. Flowers are followed by the development of the flat grey-black seed pods. Rough and furry when young before losing their fur, they are long and wide and sub-moniliform‚Äîlinear in shape and slightly swollen over the spaces where the seeds are. The mature seeds are released over November to January. A. parramattensis tends to flower later in the year than the similar early green wattle (Acacia decurrens) and black wattle (A. mearnsii). Taxonomy Australian botanist Mary Tindale of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney described Acacia parramattensis in 1962 from material she collected in 1960 from Hazelbrook in the Blue Mountains near Sydney. Its name is derived from the locality of Parramatta, west of Sydney. Common names include Sydney green wattle and Parramatta wattle. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma parramattense in 2003, in his proposal to reclassify almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma, however this name is treated as a synonym of its original name. Along with other bipinnate wattles, Acacia parramattensis is classified in the section Botrycephalae within the subgenus Phyllodineae in the genus Acacia. An analysis of genomic and chloroplast DNA along with morphological characters found that the section is polyphyletic, though the close relationships of many species were unable to be resolved. Acacia parramattensis appears to be most closely related to A. olsenii. Distribution and habitat Acacia parramattensis is found in the Sydney Basin and Blue Mountains in central New South Wales, north to Yengo National Park, west to Grenfell and south to Tumut, from sea level to elevations of . A component of dry sclerophyll forest or woodland, it is found in association with such trees as forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), Sydney blue gum (E. saligna), mountain white gum (E. dalrympleana), rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), or in drier locations with gossamer wattle (Acacia floribunda), coast myall (A. binervia), or early green wattle (A. decurrens). A. parramattensis is also a component of the rare and fragmented Southern Highlands Shale Woodlands community. Acacia parramattensis grows on alluvial or shale-based low- to medium-nutrient soil, often with some degree of clay content, or occasionally sandstone-based soils. It is found on lower slopes and along watercourses, as well as ridges. The annual rainfall is over . It has possibly naturalised in Tasmania and other parts of New South Wales.AcaciaSearch Acacia parramattensis Tindale. p.154. Retrieved 31 December 2018. Ecology The bark of A. parramattensis is thin and offers little protection from bushfire, with plants generally perishing from high intensity fires. Most above-ground growth is killed by fire, though plants with trunks thicker than diameter at breast height (dbh) may resprout from epicormic buds. Some plants can survive low intensity fires. Acacia parramattensis has a suckering habit, and can grow from basal shoots after fire, though regeneration is generally by seed after severe fires. The seed has a hard coating and remains in the soil after dropping from the seedpods. It colonises disturbed areas, and the suckers can form groves of plants. The species has a juvenile period of around five years. The seed is consumed by the common bronzewing (Phaps chalcoptera). The foliage serves as food for the caterpillars of the moonlight jewel (Hypochrysops delicia), imperial hairstreak (Jalmenus evagoras), amethyst hairstreak (Jalmenus icilius), Adult imperial hairstreak also visit the plant. The wood serves as food for larvae of the jewel beetle species Melobasis nitidiventris, Agrilus hypoleucus and A. australasiae. Older trees that are infested by borers in turn attract the insectivorous yellow-tailed black cockatoo. Cultivation Acacia parramattensis is not commonly seen in cultivation though is grown locally in Sydney and the Blue Mountains. Fast growing and adaptable, it grows 6 to 8 m (20 ‚Äì 25 ft) high over five years. It can provide shade in the garden, though is vulnerable to being infested by borers. It is propagated by seed. Fieldwork conducted in the Southern Highlands found that the presence of bipinnate wattles (either as understory or tree) was related to reduced numbers of noisy miners, an aggressive species of bird that drives off small birds from gardens and bushland, and hence recommended the use of these plants in establishing green corridors and revegetation projects.

Foods associated with famine need not be nutritionally deficient, or unsavoury. People who eat famine food in large quantity over a long period of time may become averse to it over time. In times of relative affluence, these foods may become the targets of social stigma and rejection. The characterization of a foodstuff as \\"famine\\" or \\"poverty\\" food is primarily social. For example lobster and other crustaceans may be considered poverty food in some societies and luxury food in others depending on periods.  Examples  A number of foodstuffs have been strongly associated with famine, war, or times of hardship throughout history: *The breadnut or Maya nut was cultivated by the ancient Mayans but is largely rejected as a poverty food in modern Central America. *In Polynesia, plants from the genus Xanthosoma, plants known locally as  ªape, were considered famine food and used only when the taro crop failed. *Several species of edible algae, including dulse, channelled wrack and Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), were eaten by coastal peasants during the Great Famine in Ireland of 1846‚Äì48. Further inland, famine foods included stinging nettle, wild mustard, sorrel and watercress. *Sego lily bulbs were eaten by the Mormon pioneers when their food crops failed. *Tulip bulbs and beetroots were eaten in the German-occupied parts of the Netherlands during the \\"hunger winter\\" of 1944-45. * During a number of famines in Russia and the Soviet Union, nettle, orache, and other types of wild plants were used to make breads or soups.\\"–ë—É—Ä—å—è–Ω, –∫—Ä–∞–ø–∏–≤–∞ –∏ –ª–µ–±–µ–¥–∞. –ù–∞ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º –∏–∑ —Ö–∞—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ö–ª–µ–±–æ–∑–∞–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤ –≤—ã–ø–µ–∫–ª–∏ \\"–≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π\\" —Ö–ª–µ–±\\", ATN Kharkiv. *Cat meat was eaten in the northern Italian regions of Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, and Liguria in times of famine, such as during World War II. *Likewise, during the Siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, the menu in Parisian cafes was not limited to cats but also dogs, rats, horses, donkeys, camels, and even elephants. *During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, due to a severe shortage of rice, the locals resorted to surviving on hardy tuberous roots such as cassava, sweet potato, and yam. *During the Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during the Second World War, Filipino and American servicemen resorted to consuming dog meat, monkey meat, and the meat of monitor lizards (referred to as \\"iguana lizards\\" in the source), pythons, mules, horses and carabaos as their supply of food dwindled. *In the semi-arid areas of Brazilian Northeast, the shoots and leaves of cactus Opuntia cochenillifera are normally used to feed the livestock (cattle and goats). But during long droughts, people may use them as a last resort. *Historically in the Maldives the leaves of seaside trees such as the octopus bush and the beach cabbage were often used as famine food. *The caper, the flower bud and berry of Capparis spinosa species, has been a famine food in southern Ethiopia and Sudan as well as in the 1948 siege of west Jerusalem.Yves Guinand and Dechassa Lemessa, \\"Wild-Food Plants in Southern Ethiopia: Reflections on the role of 'famine-foods' at a time of drought\\" UN- OCHA Report, March 2000 (accessed 15 January 2009) * During the Cambodian humanitarian crisis, people ate tarantulas, scorpions, silkworms, and grasshoppers.

The station was started by Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Service) in 1958 on 840AM with the callsign 2XB. The station was originally branded as its callsign 2XB. In 1968 2XB changed became known as 2ZD when the station changed callsigns. In 1978 the station moved to 846AM when AM frequency spacing in New Zealand was adjusted from 10 kHz to 9 kHz. During the 1980s the station became known on air as Radio Wairarapa. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included Radio Wairarapa. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 The Radio Network grouped all their local stations in smaller markets together to form the Community Radio Network. The station continued to run a local breakfast show between 6am and 10am but outside breakfast all stations part of the Community Radio Network took network programming from a central studio based in Taupo. Coinciding with the change Radio Wairarapa began broadcasting on 90.1FM and renamed to 90.1 Wairarapa FM. In 2001 the Community Radio Network was discontinued and all stations become part of the Classic Hits FM network, as a result Wairarapa FM was rebranded as Classic Hits Wairarapa FM. The station continued to run a local breakfast but now outside breakfast all programming originated from the Classic Hits studios in Auckland. In 2010 the station moved to 90.3FM are part of a government alignment of frequencies around New Zealand, at this point the station became known as Classic Hits 90.3 In 2013 the local breakfast show was dropped and Wairarapa listeners began hearing the Classic Hits Wellington breakfast show instead. On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. As the Wairarapa station already previously ran the local Wellington breakfast, and contained no local Waiarapa programming, the change was to run both the network breakfast and daytime show creating a complete networked station.

Stead also played provincially for Southland, and later coached various teams, including Southland and the New Zealand MƒÅori. A bootmaker by trade, he also co-authored The Complete Rugby Footballer with Dave Gallaher, and was a columnist for the Southland Times, and New Zealand Truth. Current living relatives include renowned infectious diseases physician Dr Aidan Wilson.  Early rugby career  Billy Stead was born in Invercargill on 18 September 1877, and one of his earliest exposures to rugby was watching Joe Warbrick with his New Zealand Native football team play against Southland. Neither Stead's primary nor secondary school (Southland Boys' High School) did much to encourage students to play rugby, but he did manage to get a place in the school team after debuting as a late injury replacement. He left school aged 16 to enter his trade as a bootmaker, and along with some friends tried to join the local Pirates' Rugby Club, but the club could not accommodate the interest of all those that wanted to join, and so Stead was told to instead join Star Rugby Club. After joining the club he played for their second and third teams for a couple of years before earning promotion to their senior side in 1896. He played at First five-eighths for the side, and in his first season earned selected for his province. Provincial and international selection Stead first played representative rugby for Southland in 1896. He was only 18 at the time, and continued to play for the province until 1908; eventually raking up 52 matches for the side. After representing the South Island in 1903, he was selected for the All Blacks that year. Although he did tour with the team to Australia, he did not play in a Test match until the following year. In his first Test against Great Britain in 1904, Stead captained the side. He was again selected for the All Blacks the following year for their northern hemisphere tour. Although he did not participate in the preliminary tour of Australia due to work commitments, Stead did play against Canterbury and then Wellington for the All Blacks. Dave Gallaher was named as the tour captain, with Stead as vice-captain. On the voyage to Britain, both players resigned as captain and vice-captain respectively. They had both been appointed by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU), but believed that the players should have a say in the choice of captain. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the team still took a vote; going 17 to 12 in favour of endorsing the NZRFU's selections The tour was highly successful for Stead as he established himself as one of New Zealand's greatest ever first-five eighths. Stead participated in 29 of the Originals' matches, and although he only scored 11 tries for the team, his ability to set up tries for other players was vital. Jimmy Hunter, who scored 44 tries on tour, said to him at the Originals' 50 year reunion, \\"Without you I was nothing\\". Stead was considered a master tactician, and him missing the teams' Wales Test was considered a major factor in their only loss. Billy Stead did not play for New Zealand in their fixture against Wales on their 1905‚Äì06 tour, and his absence was considered a major factor in New Zealand's loss. Standing on the far left of the back row, he is pictured here posing with the team before the match. Before the New Zealand squad left Britain, English publisher Henry Leach asked Stead and Gallaher to author a book on rugby tactics and play. They finished the task in under a fortnight and were each paid ¬£50. Entitled The Complete Rugby Footballer, the book was 322 pages long and included chapters on tactics and play, as well as a summary of rugby's history in New Zealand including the 1905 tour. It was mainly authored by Stead, a bootmaker, with Gallaher contributing most of the diagrams. Gallaher almost certainly made some contributions to the text, including sections on Auckland club rugby, and on forward play. The book showed the All Blacks' tactics and planning to be superior to others of the time, and according to Matt Elliott is \\"marvellously astute\\"; it received universal acclaim on its publication. According to a 2011 assessment by ESPN's Graham Jenkins, it \\"remains one of the most influential books produced in the realms of rugby literature\\". After the Originals' tour, Stead's next All Blacks' match was not until 1908 when he captained them twice against the Anglo-Welsh. Following the 1908 season, Stead went into semi-retirement, but was persuaded to play for the New Zealand MƒÅori. The MƒÅori team was formed after a proposal by Ned Parata to the NZRFU, and a tour to New South Wales was organised for 1910. Stead was named vice-captain for the tour, and played in the first ever MƒÅori match, against the Rotorua sub union on 21 May 1910. The side then played a match against Auckland, which they lost, before departing for Australia. He played in 13 of the sides matches on tour, including their 13‚Äì8 win against Queensland, which was the first MƒÅori victory over significant opposition. The tour generated a modest profit which was donated to a girls' school, and provided the foundation for the continued existence of the side. In retirement After his retirement, Stead continued to be involved in rugby as an administrator and coach. In 1921 he coached the All Blacks in two of their Tests against South Africa. Stead also coached the New Zealand MƒÅori, as well as writing for the Southland Times and New Zealand Truth.

Khomeini, Life of an Ayatollah. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 104. . The Shah's regime was taken by surprise by the massive public demonstrations of support, and although these were crushed within days by the police and military, the events established the importance and power of (Shia) religious opposition to the Shah, and Khomeini as a major political and religious leader.Staff (undated). \\"Ayatollah Khomeini Biography\\" Bio. Retrieved June 3, 2012. Fifteen years later, Khomeini was to lead the Iranian Revolution which overthrew the Shah and his Pahlavi dynasty and established the Islamic Republic of Iran. Background Khomeini speaking in Qom and criticizing Shah's government In 1963, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran's Shah started several modernizing reforms in Iran which was known as \\"The Revolution of the Shah and the People\\" or the White Revolution, it was referred to as white due to it being a bloodless revolution. These plans were to make social and economic changes in Iran. Therefore, on January 26, 1963, the Shah held a national referendum for 19 rules of White Revolution. The rules of this revolution were land reforms, nationalization of the forests and pastureland, privatization of the government owned enterprises, profit sharing, extending the right to vote to women, formation of the literacy corps, formation of the health corps, formation of the reconstruction and development corps, formation of the houses of equity, nationalization of all water resources, urban and rural modernization and reconstruction, didactic reforms, workers' right to own shares in the industrial complexes, price stabilization, free and compulsory education, free food for needy mothers, introduction of social security and national insurance, stable and reasonable cost of renting or buying of residential properties, and introduction of measures to fight against corruption. The Shah announced this revolution as a way towards Modernization. Also, other sources believe that the Shah could give legitimacy to Pahlavi dynasty with his White Revolution. The revolution caused a deep rift between Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Iranian Shia religious scholars, Ulama. They claimed these changes were a serious threat to Islam. Ruhollah Khomeini was one of the objectors who held a meeting with other Maraji and scholars in Qom and boycotted the referendum of the revolution. On January 22, 1963, Khomeini issued a worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programs, issuing a manifesto that also bore the signatures of eight other senior religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the U.S. and Israel. He also decreed that the Norooz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on March 21, 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies. Events =Khomeini's sermon and arrest= Picture believed to be of Khomeini's arrest in 1963. In 2011, the picture's author denied this. On the afternoon of June 3, 1963, Ashoura, Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh School in which he drew parallels between the Umayyad Caliph Yazid I and the Shah. He denounced the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man\\", and warned him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.\\"History of Iran: Ayatollah Khomeini\\". In Tehran, a Muharram march of Khomeini supporters estimated at 100,000 marched past the Shah's palace, chanting \\"Death to the Dictator, death to the dictator! God save you, Khomeini! Death to the bloodthirsty enemy!\\"Moin, Baqer (2000). Khomeini, Life of an Ayatollah. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 106. . Two days later at three o'clock in the morning, security men and commandos descended on Khomeini's home in Qom and arrested him. They hastily transferred him to the Qasr Prison in Tehran. =Uprising= Protesters carrying the body of one of the victims As dawn broke on June 5, the news of his arrest spread first through Qom and then to other cities. In Qom, Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad and Varamin, masses of angry demonstrators were confronted by tanks and paratroopers. In Tehran, demonstrators attacked police stations, SAVAK offices and government buildings, including ministries. The surprised government declared martial law and a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. The Shah then ordered a division of the Imperial Guard, under the command of Major General Gholam Ali Oveisi, to move into the city and crush the demonstrations. The following day, protest groups took to the street in smaller numbers and were confronted by tanks and \\"soldiers in combat gear with shoot-to-kill orders\\".Moin, Baqer (2000). Khomeini, Life of an Ayatollah. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 111‚Äì113. . The village of Pishva near Varamin became famous during the uprising. Several hundred villagers from Pishva began marching to Tehran, shouting \\"Khomeini or Death\\". They were stopped at a railroad bridge by soldiers who opened fire with machine guns when the villagers refused to disperse and attacked the soldiers \\"with whatever they had\\". Whether \\"tens or hundreds\\" were killed is \\"unclear\\". It was not until six days later that order was fully restored. According to journalist Baqer Moin, police files indicate 320 people from a wide variety of backgrounds, including 30 leading clerics, were arrested on June 5. The files also list 380 people as killed or wounded in the uprising, not including those who did not go to hospital \\"for fear of arrest\\", or who were taken to the morgue or buried by security forces. =Release of Khomeini= Prime Minister Asadollah Alam was one of the supporters of arrest of Khomeini. Hardliners in the regime (Prime Minister Asadollah Alam, SAVAK head Nematollah Nassiri) favored execution of Khomeini, as one responsible for the riots, and (less- violent) strikes and protests continued in bazaars and elsewhere. Fateme Pakravan wife of Hassan Pakravan, chief of SAVAK says in her memoirs that her husband saved Khomeini's life in 1963. Pakravan felt that his execution would anger the common people of Iran. He presented his argument to the Shah. Once he had convinced the Shah to allow him to find a way out, he called on Ayatollah Mohammad-Kazem Shariatmadari, one of the senior religious leaders of Iran, and asked for his help. Shariatmadari suggested that Khomeini be declared a Marja. So, other Marjas made a religious decree which was taken by Pakravan and Seyyed Jalal Tehrani to the Shah.Pakravan, Fatemeh (1998). Memoirs of Fatemeh Pakravan Wife of Gen. Hassan Pakravan, Army Officer, Chief of State Security & Intelligence Organization, Cabinet Minister. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies. . Pakravan's saving of Khomeini's life cost him his own. After the revolution when he was given a death sentence, a personal contact of Pakravan with close ties to Khomeini went to seek his pardon and reminded Khomeini that Pakravan had saved his life, to which Khomeini replied \\"he should not have.\\" After nineteen days in the Qasr Prison, Khomeini was moved first to the Eshratabad military base and then to a house in the Davoodiyeh section of Tehran where he was kept under surveillance. He was released on April 7, 1964, and returned to Qom. After the revolution The date of 15 Khordad is widely noted throughout the Islamic Republic of Iran. Among other places, the intersection known as 15 Khordad Crossroads, a 15th of Khordad Metro Station are named after it. Coincidentally, Khomeini died twenty-six years later in 1989, on the eve of 15 Khordad.

Many Wobbly terms derive from or are coextensive with hobo expressions used through the 1940s. Origin and usage Words and phrases in Wobbly lingo may have different meanings in different contexts or in different geographic areas. The \\"lingo\\" developed from the specific needs of the organization as well as the experiences of working-class people. For several decades, many hobos in the United States were members of, or were sympathetic to, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Because of this, some of the terms describe the life of a hobo such as \\"riding the rails\\", living in \\"jungles\\", dodging the \\"bulls\\". The IWW's efforts to organize all trades allowed the lingo to expand to include terms relating to mining camps, timber work, and farming. Other derivations of Wobbly lingo come from a confluence of Native American languages, immigrant languages, and jargon. These meanings may vary over time. The word muckamuck in Wobbly lingo refers to someone important and possibly arrogant. Hyas muckamuck from Chinook jargon (literally, \\"big food\\", a reference to the quantity and quality of food eaten by the noble class) means the chief or the big boss. In modern blue collar usage, this word is one of many mildly sarcastic slang terms used to refer to bosses and upper management. A variation is a phrase high muckety-muck. Some words and phrases believed to have originated within Wobbly lingo have gained cultural significance outside of the IWW. For example, from Joe Hill's song \\"The Preacher and the Slave\\", the expression pie in the sky has passed into common usage, referring to a \\"preposterously optimistic goal.\\" Glossary =A= =B= =C= =D= =E= =F= =G= =H= =I= =J= =K= =L= =M= =N= =O= =P= =R= A Wobbly membership card, or \\"red card\\" =S= =T= =U= =V= =W= =Y= See also *The use of slang is a means of recognising members of the same group, and to differentiate that group from society at large, while the use of jargon relates to a specific activity, profession, or group. *Slang terms are frequently particular to a certain subculture. *Chinook jargon, especially for northwest timber country usage.

Biography Hotham was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Beaumont Hotham of South Dalton, East Riding of Yorkshire and Philadelphia Dyke. His father died when he was five years old. He was educated at Westminster School. He joined the army as an Ensign in the Coldstream Guards in 1810, and was promoted to captain in 1813, major in 1819, lieut.-colonel in 1825; colonel in 1838, major-general in 1851, lieut.-general in 1858 and full general in 1865. He fought in the Peninsular campaign of 1812‚Äì1814, including the Battle of Salamanca and the Battle of Vitoria and was at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In 1814 he succeeded his grandfather as third Baron Hotham, but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He was instead elected to the House of Commons for Leominster in 1820, a seat he held, with a brief exception for a few months in 1831, until 1841, and then represented the East Riding of Yorkshire between 1841 and 1868. By the time he retired from the House of Commons he was one of the longest- serving Members of Parliament. In 1771 he rebuilt at his own expense the Parish Church of South Dalton near to the family seat of Dalton Hall. Lord Hotham died in December 1870, aged 76, and was buried in his church at South Dalton. He never married and was succeeded in his titles and estates by his nephew Charles.

The site offered a variety of music, special collections, as well as audiobooks in English. Songs were priced per song, with prices from 9 to 19 cents; audiobooks range from around $1.60 through $5.00 USD. The site's design and display were highly similar to MP3Search.ru along with current database collection numbers; in fact, users with a GoMusic account who tried to sign into the Mp3Search.ru login page were told that their account was a part of the GoMusic network. Features The site provided songs in MP3 format. The songs lacked any digital rights management and thus were compatible with any MP3 player including the iPod, Zune, and Creative Zen. A majority of the songs were in the VBR format. The bit rate, along with album year and sometimes the genre, was stated in the header information for all albums. GoMusicNow users could purchase and download an entire album or list of songs in one click for 10% off. According to the Terms of Use,Terms of Use , Section 4.3 a purchased song may be downloaded only once. Nonetheless, the Archive feature allowed for a second download of a song. If the second download was not sufficient, a song could be repurchased. Members could also submit album requests to the site's support desk. Members needed sufficient funds paid into their GoMusic account in order to purchase music. Members could acquire funds by paying into their account with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express credit cards or TelPay. GoMusicNow only allowed a payment of less than 30 USD on the first payment into the member's account. Afterwards, it was mandatory for at least $20 USD payments or higher. This led some users to complain that they would not be able to purchase single or a few albums without carrying an extraneous debit on their credit card, which may compound depending on interest rates or value of currency. History At the end of 2008, GoMusic's website changed both aesthetically and functionally. New scripts were added to simplify the download process, especially when buying full albums. For a few months prior to this, all options to pay with a debit or credit card dropped off the site, allowing users to pay only by the telepay method. When credit card funding came back after the site re-design, the minimum amount to replenish the account went from $20.00 USD to $30.00 USD, and 3 more pricing tiers above $30.00 were added as well. In June 2009, adding funds to your account no longer re-directed to a website outside of the site. The option to add funds and enter your credit card information was an input page on the main site. That August, Recording Industry of South Africa (RISA) requested that the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) block access to GoMusicNow because of how cheap the downloads were but ISPA refused. Information other than the music catalog was available to site visitors is quite sparse, with only the Terms of Service, the Copyright information, and a form for support requests. The site has claimed in the past that it is legal in Russia, in accordance with the Noncommercial Partnership \\"Federation of Authors and Rightsholders for Collective Management of Copyright in Interactive Regime.\\" However, similar to AllofMP3, the legality of the site is questionable. The argument over whether MP3 download sites in Russia are legal continues, with viewpoints from both sides.Rindlesbach, Morgan. \\"Fifteen cents a song -- is it too good to be true?\\", Hard News Cafe Utah State University, December 15, 2006 As of 12 April 2013, users could still search for and download music but couldn't replenish account funds.

Born in Trondheim, Norway, he began playing the tuba at the age of fifteen at his school in Trondheim, Norway, and won first prize at eighteen in a Norwegian national competition for soloists. His concert engagements include performances with orchestras such as the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Bergen Philharmonic, Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, the Taipei National Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Philharmonic and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. 2006 he made his New York recital debut at Carnegie Hall. He studied under the tuba player Harvey Phillips and with Arnold Jacobs. √òystein Baadsvik‚Äôs international career began in 1991 when he was awarded two prizes at Concours International d‚ÄôEx√©cution Musicale in Geneva. √òystein Baadsvik is known for his master classes, performances, and tuba clinics which are frequently held in numerous universities throughout the world including The Juilliard School, Indiana University, Cleveland Institute of Music, Northwestern University, Shepherd School of Music at Rice University, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Texas Christian University, The Royal College of Music Eastern Connecticut State University, Old Dominion University, and the University of Kentucky. In addition, every October, a tour of various colleges and universities occurs, coinciding with Octubafest, a yearly celebration of tuba music.  Fnugg  One of Baadsvik's most well-known works is Fnugg (Norwegian for something small or a snowflake). Fnugg was originally written for solo Tuba and features a variety of unique performance skills, including \\"lip beats\\" and multiphonics. It was later modified, with a major addition for either brass band or concert band and was titled Fnugg Blue. His YouTube performance of Fnugg Blue was very theatrical in nature, with dancing and clapping from the audience.

They had five children: * Giuseppe Grifeo * Marianna Grifeo * Vincenzo Grifeo * Leopoldo Grifeo * Luigi Grifeo On 27 November 1814, Lucia married Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, also known as Ferdinand III of Sicily, in Palermo. The bride was forty-four years old and the groom sixty-three. Their marriage created a scandal as it took place on September 8, 1814, within three months of the death of his first wife Queen Maria Carolina of Austria. Protocol rules required at least one-year period of mourning. By then, Ferdinand had already practically abdicated his power by naming his eldest son Prince Francis as his regent and delegating most decisions to him. His deceased queen, Maria Carolina, herself had been considered the de facto ruler of Sicily until 1812. Lucia after her marriage had very limited influence and little interest in politics. Ferdinand was restored to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples by right of his victory on the Battle of Tolentino (3 May 1815) over Joachim Murat. On 8 December 1816 he merged the thrones of Sicily and Naples under the name of the throne of the Two Sicilies, with Francis still serving as his regent and Lucia as his morganatic spouse. Ferdinand continued to rule until his death on 4 January 1825. Lucia survived him by a year and three months. She was buried in the Church of San Ferdinando, Naples.

Georgia, 385 U.S. 545 (1967), found in favor of the petitioner (Whitus), who had been convicted for murder, and as such reversed their convictions.. This was due to the Georgia jury selection policies, in which it was alleged racial discrimination had occurred. The plaintiffs argued that, as their county had a 45% population of African-Americans, it was discrimination and unfair to have been presented with all-white or nearly all-white juries each time. Thus, the Supreme Court ‚Äì as well as overturning the convictions ‚Äì ruled that Georgia renew its jury selection policies. Previous law meant tax returns would be sorted, and \\"Negroes\\" would have a '(c)' placed next to their name. In the conviction of Whitus, the jury had been selected via old lists.  Background  After petitioners, who are Negroes, were convicted of murder in the Georgia courts, they filed a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts, attacking the composition of the grand and petit juries which indicted and convicted them. The District Court dismissed the writ and the Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court vacated that judgment and remanded to the District Court for a hearing on the claim of discrimination ( 370 U.S. 728 ).  Decision  = Majority opinion = The majority opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark. Justice Clark states that the appeal is not whether the defendants were wrongfully convicted of murder but if the jury selection purposely excluded the admittance of African Americans from the grand and petit juries. The system of selecting jurors comes from the books of the county tax receiver but questions have been raised about if the system is rigged with notations that signify which males on the tax receiver‚Äôs list are African American. The court granted certiorari and found the circumstances surrounding the state were sufficient to support the claims of racial discrimination. = Decision = On January 23, 1967, in a nine to zero unanimous decision, the Supreme Court stated that the case of Whitus v. Georgia should be reversed and the law in question, being the 14th Amendment concerning equal protections, should be upheld and seen as constitutional. From the opinion of Justice Clark, the decision was overturned because the circumstances surrounding the case supported the claims of the petitioners. The claims were claims of discrimination which the Court had realized and therefore reversed the judgement. The Court of Appeals held that African Americans were purposely being excluded from the grand juries and the petit juries. The ruling to reverse the judgment and prove discrimination was based on the finding that 45% of the population was African American yet no African American had ever actually served on a jury.  Influence  The Whitus case influenced court decisions in the future. In McCleskey v. Kemp, petitioner, a black man, was convicted in a Georgia trial court of armed robbery and murder, arising from the killing of a white police officer during the robbery of a store. Pursuant to Georgia statutes, the jury at the penalty hearing considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of petitioner's conduct, and recommended the death penalty on the murder charge. The trial court followed the recommendation, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. After unsuccessfully seeking postconviction relief in state courts, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court. His petition included a claim that the Georgia capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. In support of the claim, petitioner proffered a statistical study (the Baldus study) that purports to show a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the murder victim's race and, to a lesser extent, the defendant's race. The study is based on over 2,000 murder cases that occurred in Georgia during the 1970s, and involves data relating to the victim's race, the defendant's race, and the various combinations of such persons' races. The study indicates that black defendants who killed white victims have the greatest likelihood of receiving the death penalty. Rejecting petitioner's constitutional claims, the court denied his petition insofar as it was based on the Baldus study, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision on this issue. It assumed the validity of the Baldus study, but found the statistics insufficient to demonstrate unconstitutional discrimination in the Fourteenth Amendment context or to show irrationality, arbitrariness, and capriciousness under Eighth Amendment analysis. Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving \\"the existence of purposeful discrimination.\\" Whitus v.

These shires were based on a form of local government used in England at the time, and were redesignated as counties a few years later. As of 2007, five of the eight original shires were considered still extant in the Commonwealth of Virginia in essentially their same political form, although some boundaries and several names have changed in the almost 400 years since their creation. History In 1634, a new system of local government was created in the Virginia Colony by order of King Charles I of England. Eight shires were named by the House of Burgesses, each with its own local officers. The term shire in this system was officially renamed as county only a few years later. There were also several early individual name changes, notably Warrosquyoake, a Native American name with varied spellings that became Isle of Wight. Also, during the English Civil War, Charles River County and the Charles River were changed to York County and York River respectively (though Charles City County kept its royal name). The original Shires of Virginia were: *Accomac Shire (now Northampton & Accomack Counties) *Charles City Shire (now Charles City County) *Charles River Shire (now York County) *Elizabeth City Shire (extinct ‚Äì consolidated with the City of Hampton) *Henrico Shire (now Henrico County) *James City Shire (now James City County) *Warwick River Shire (extinct ‚Äì consolidated with the City of Newport News) *Warrosquyoake Shire (now Isle of Wight County) Four of the shire names included names of cities that had been created in 1619. Between 1637 and 1642, their names formalized from \\"Shire\\" to \\"County\\", and the results apparently caused confusion two centuries later. This is due to names, such as \\"James City County\\" and \\"Charles City County\\" that seem contradictory to some in Virginia because after independent cities were introduced by the 1870 Constitution of Virginia, an area can be in a city or in a county, but cannot be in both. *The county that included the original 1607 settlement at Jamestown apparently attempted to address any potential confusion long ago, when its legal name was the \\"County of James City\\" for a time. It is now officially James City County again. *In 1952, the citizens of \\"Elizabeth City County\\" voted to relinquish county status, and consolidate with the independent city of Hampton. They also voted to assume the better- known and shorter name of Hampton. *Also in 1952, Warwick County converted to an independent city. On July 1, 1958, the still nascent city of Warwick was politically re-consolidated with the independent city of Newport News to the south and east, which had itself broken away from Warwick County earlier in 1896.

The series proved to be very popular, reaching cult status and televised, among others, in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, The Netherlands and both German states. The series still regularly appear on television. Each consists of 13 episodes. The Family The family consists of G√©za, the father, a comical and inept figure similar to Homer Simpson, his wife Paula who actually dominates family affairs, pubertal daughter Kriszta and 12-14-year-old son Alad√°r (12 in first series, 14 in the last, the medium age is 13), a child prodigy. The cat Maffia and a dog, Bl√∂ki (Zorro) accompany the family. Dr. M√°ris, their cynical neighbour, is regularly and unvoluntarily involved in disasters surrounding the family. The name \\"M√©zga\\" means glue, mucilage or tree gum in Hungarian and was renamed as rodina Smol√≠kova in Czech, which is a surname (derived from \\"sm≈Øla\\", i.e. \\"tree gum\\" or \\"bad luck\\") used also in fairy tales, La famiglia Mezil in Italian, Familie Metzger in German, which means butcher,–°–µ–º–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ú–µ–π–∑–≥–∞ in Bulgarian, Fam√≠lia M√©zga/Mesga in Portuguese, and Miazgovci in Slovak.

The family makes contact with MZ/X, their descendant from the 30th century, with whom child prodigy Alad√°r made a contact. MZ/X sends them, through the time, various hypermodern gadgets which invariably result in a disaster.

In another episode a house cleaning robot destroys the furniture because he doesn't understand commands in 20th century Hungarian language.) Episodes usually end with Paula's catch phrase \\"Why didn't I marry Pisti Hufn√°gel?\\", implying that she often regrets she chose G√©za over another suitor.

Since its establishment in 2008, as an alternative to sharing avian influenza data via conventional public-domain archives, GISAID is recognized for incentivizing rapid exchange of outbreak data during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. GISAID was recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers in 2017. In 2020, GISAID entered into the global research effort to understand SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, by making available genomic sequences that are modeled in real time, thereby helping to detect viral mutations and track movement of the virus across the planet. Huge volumes of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been added to the GISAID database, rapidly shared by laboratories around the world. Origin The idea for GISAID was first discussed in 2006 in a letter to the journal Nature with the call for a new global initiative on sharing avian flu data. The correspondence letter was signed by over 70 leading scientists including seven Nobel laureates because access to the latest genetic data for highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza zoonotic infections was often restricted, in part due to the hesitancy of World Health Organization member states to share their virus genomes and put ownership rights at risk. Once launched in 2008 (as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data), GISAID also sought to address medical researchers' reticence toward sharing data in the pre- publication phase, out of their fear of being scooped. Public-domain archives, such as EMBL, DDBJ and GenBank, are also known as anonymous access databases, which therefore offer little to no protection of submitters‚Äô rights, verification of users, transparency on use of data, and acknowledgement of original specimen providers. The original intent was to upload GISAID sequence data to public databases within 6 months. Since 1952, influenza strains have been collected by National Influenza Centers (NICs) and distributed through the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). GISAID was adopted partly in response to the fact that Indonesia began withholding H5N1 influenza samples. Indonesia began withholding these samples partly because an H5N1 vaccine based on Indonesian samples was too expensive for Indonesia.\\"The Public Health Importance of Timely Sharing of Sequence Data\\" GISAID Next Generation Sequencing Workshop (Institute Pasteur, Paris 2015) The Initiative has earned widespread international support around the goal of better understanding the spread and evolution of influenza viruses (and later, the 2019 coronavirus), their transmissibility, and pathogenicity. With this goal in mind, the Initiative determined that scientists from different fields of expertise needed full access to comprehensive genetic sequencing, clinical and epidemiological data, as well as analysis from both human and animal isolates in order to better understand the virus and its potential mutation to a pandemic pathogen. The Initiative has aimed to provide developing countries better access to scientific research and the development of potential pandemic flu vaccines to lessen their dependence on foreign aid. The GISAID model of incentivizing and recognizing those who deposit data has been recommended as a model for future initiatives. Greater transparency and more timely sharing of sequence data has been a goal of many researchers and stakeholders alike. The GISAID platform spans national borders and scientific disciplines, with leaders in the fields of veterinary medicine, human medicine, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and intellectual property. This cross-disciplinary effort provides new means to communicate and share information, as each discipline has distinct interests but also shares similar goals. The Initiative came together in a way that gives credit to those submitting data and makes substantial efforts to work with and include them in collaborative analyses on viral sequence data, \\"further tipping the scales in favor of collaboration\\". The notion of sharing not just data, but also the benefits of resulting research, represented a \\"paradigm shift\\" that puts contributors from higher and lower resource environments on more equal footing.  History  Official signing ceremony with GISAID President Peter Bogner (l) and German State Secretary Robert Kloos Source: left The GISAID Initiative was initially funded by Peter Bogner--a strategic advisor and international broadcasting executive --who serves as its founder and principal facilitator. Bogner has been directing the build-up of this platform by bringing together the world's leading scientists and stakeholders who are actively committed to accelerating understanding of this potential human pandemic by rapidly sharing scientific data and results. In January 2006, Bogner met with US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and was told about the US government's preparedness concept on dealing with the potential of a flu pandemic. Concerns about a pandemic scenario heightened. In November 2006, the Initiative received the endorsement of both The Royal Society and Academy of Medical Sciences. In February 2007, it was announced that GISAID and the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, which leads a Swiss consortium to manage the GISAID Database on influenza virus strains, had signed a cooperation agreement. Under this agreement, the Geneva-based institute was to provide services for the secure storage and analysis of genetic, epidemiological, and clinical data. In January 2007, Indonesia stopped sharing all H5N1 clinical samples with WHO. In March 2007, Siti Fadilah Supari, Indonesia's Minister of Health, announced the Indonesian government supports the formation of the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID) following a high-level WHO meeting in Jakarta on Responsible Practices for Sharing Avian Influenza Viruses. In April 2007, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences reaffirmed its endorsement of GISAID, stating it shares the same ideals regarding free exchange and responsible sharing of information of avian influenza and emerging infectious diseases. In 2008, GISAID was adopted by ‚ÄúWHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza‚Äù for entering sequence data from samples received from National Influenza Centers (NICs) in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In April 2010, the Federal Republic of Germany announced during the 7th International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in Hanoi, Vietnam, that the GISAID Initiative entered into a cooperation agreement with the German government, making Germany the long-term host of the GISAID platform.\\"Germany‚Äôs Statement on Substantive Issues and Concerns Regarding the PIP Framework and its Implementation, Special Session of the PIP Advisory Group, 13 October 2015\\", World Health Organization, Geneva. Retrieved on 2016-11-08. Under the agreement, Germany, represented by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection BMELV, will ensure the sustainability of the initiative by providing through its Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) the technical hosting facilities of the GISAID platform and EpiFlu‚Ñ¢ database, located in Bonn. Germany's Federal Institute for Animal Health the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) located on the Isle of Riems, will ensure the plausibility and curation of scientific data in GISAID to meet scientific standards.  Governance  GISAID's governance structureGISAID Governance structure, accessed 23 November 2016 provides for several organizational bodies that operate independently of each other, with the aim to guard against bias in decision-making. GISAID's administrative affairs are overseen by a Board of Trustees expected to minimize potential conflicts of interest concerning GISAID's funding sources. Scientific oversight of the initiative comes from its Scientific Advisory Council made up of directors of leading public health laboratories including all six WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza, and directors of animal health reference laboratories for research on avian influenza for the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This governance structure is meant to improve the functional capabilities of the EpiFlu‚Ñ¢ database managed by GISAID's Database Technical Group, composed of experts in virus sequencing and bioinformatics, who represent the user community to interact with software and developers of tools for analysis.  Access and intellectual property  Unlike public-domain databases such as GenBank and EMBL, users of GISAID must have their identity confirmed and agree to a Database Access AgreementGISAID Database Access Agreement , accessed 8 May 2020 that governs the way GISAID data can be used. These Terms of Use prevent users from sharing any data with other users who have not agreed to the Terms of Use. The Terms of Use require that users of the data must acknowledge the data generators in published work, and also make a reasonable attempt to collaborate with data generators and involve them in research and analysis that uses their data. A difficulty that GISAID's Data Access Agreement attempts to address is that many researchers fear sharing of influenza sequence data could facilitate its misappropriation through intellectual property claims by the vaccine industry and others, hindering access to vaccines and other items in developing countries, either through high costs or by preventing technology transfer. While most public interest experts agree with GISAID that influenza sequence data should be made public, and this is the subject of agreement by many researchers, some provide the information only after filing patent claims while others have said that access to it should be only on the condition that no patents or other intellectual property claims are filed. GISAID's Data Access Agreement addresses this directly to promote sharing data. GISAID's procedures additionally suggest that those who access the EpiFlu database consult the countries of origin of genetic sequences and the researchers who discovered the sequences.

He is credited with the creation of the genre in Japanese literature. His real name was Hirotsu Naoto. Early life Ry≈´r≈ç was born in Nagasaki, Buzen province (present-day Nagasaki prefecture), to a samurai-class family originally from Kurume domain. His father had been trained as a doctor, and was in Nagasaki studying western medicine at the time of the Meiji Restoration. Under the new Meiji government, he became a diplomat, and was involved in the Seikanron issue between Japan and Korea. Ry≈´r≈ç was sent to Tokyo in 1874 to study the German language, and subsequently enrolled in the medical preparatory school of Tokyo Imperial University, but left without graduating in 1877. The following year, at the invitation of his father's friend Godai Tomoatsu, he moved to Osaka, and obtained a position as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce from 1881-1885. Around this time, he read the Chinese literature classic Outlaws of the Marsh and the Japanese fantasy novel Nans≈ç Satomi Hakkenden by Kyokutei Bakin. These works, combined with the death of his father, formed a turning point in his life, and he decided to abandon his secure career in the government for life as a writer. Literary career In 1899, Ry≈´r≈ç met Ozaki K≈çy≈ç, and joined his literary group Ken'yusha. In 1895, he published two novels which enabled him to achieve literary recognition: Hemeden and Kurotogake. These were the first of a new genre in Japanese literature, the \\"tragic novel\\", which he created. Heavily influenced by earlier Edo period gesaku writing, his stories are filled with improbable or incredible events, melodrama, romanticism and rather wooden characterization. His plots are typified by an inexorable progression of the protagonist through a series of pathetic and wretched experiences towards destruction dictated by an inflexible fate. His most famous work, Imado Shinju (Suicide at Imado), was published in 1896. Ry≈´r≈ç retired from writing in 1908, and died of a heart attack in 1928. His grave is at the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.

Outlaw stars Sean Bean, Danny Dyer, Bob Hoskins, Lennie James, Rupert Friend and Sean Harris. The film is set in Britain in 2007. Sean Bean plays a soldier who returns home from duty to find that the country for which he has been fighting has become a war zone itself thanks to rampant crime. He joins forces with likeminded people to take on the evil that threatens to take over his home. Plot The film begins by exploring stories involving a number of different characters who live in and around London, all of whom have experiences which lead them to believe that justice in the country is not being handed out fairly. These characters include nice guy white-collar worker Gene Dekker (Danny Dyer), who is brutally beaten by yobs without any reason on the way to his wedding. Danny Bryant (Sean Bean) is a paratrooper who has seen action in the Falklands, Afghanistan and Iraq and who arrives back from abroad to find his wife with someone else, and also believes that the state of the country is worse than the war-torn places he has recently served in. Crown Court prosecution barrister Cedric Munroe (Lennie James) receives death threats towards his pregnant wife, being told they will only be safe if he pulls out of the case against club owner and heroin dealer Terry Manning (Rob Fry), a boss of the criminal underworld, who Munroe is currently prosecuting. Cambridge University student Sandy Mardell (Rupert Friend) and son of Bryant's former commanding officer has only recently left hospital, though the thugs who scarred him for life in an unprovoked physical attack were released from prison before he had made his recovery. Through the help of jingoistic hotel security guard and former football hooligan Simon Hillier (Sean Harris), who has a connection to all the men in one form or another, the men are united - Munroe had previously defended him in court, Dekker had gone to school with him, and Bryant stays in the hotel where he works. The men form a vigilante gang, targeting individuals who they determine to be a threat to society. Information on said targets is provided to them by Munroe's police contact Walter Lewis (Bob Hoskins), one of the few police officers who is not corrupt and who has been demoted to work behind a desk by his superiors. The men work through targets associated with Manning, whose men went ahead with their threat against Munroe's pregnant wife, killing her and their unborn child. The men use firearms Bryant stole from active duty with the army. The gang attract media attention and become known as the \\"Outlaws\\", but get themselves into trouble when they reveal their identities to one of Manning's men, Ian Furlong, yet fail to kill him. As a result, Furlong kills Lewis, and Bryant, the leader of the outlaws, is subsequently framed for the murder. Following this the gang go their separate ways, though not before Bryant hangs Hillier for being a liability, questioning his authority and insulting his wife. As they all go back to their day-to-day lives, Manning is released from custody because of lack of prosecution. Bryant confronts Furlong in a pub regarding Manning's location, and shoots Furlong through the head. Dekker receives word from his friend and colleague Frank Lordish that he learned from his brother that Manning is hiding in the countryside. Dekker flees his wedding to contact Munroe when he realises that he cannot live a quiet life while letting Manning get away. The pair contact Mardell, who after meeting up with Bryant, decides that they will not survive the attack on Manning's home. Bryant, Munroe and Dekker infiltrate Manning's home, yet quickly discover that it is an ambush, with armed police soon arriving outside, led by the corrupt Sgt. Grieves (George Anton) of the Flying Squad, who is in league with Manning. The three outlaws engage in a gunfight with the police and manage to flee into the woods for one final showdown. Dekker is shot in the shoulder and Bryant is killed while advancing towards the armed response squad and shooting at them. Munroe willingly surrenders only to be murdered by the now blatantly corrupt police officers. When it appears that all the vigilantes are dead, Dekker is revealed to still be alive and was playing dead. He successfully escapes through the forest, pursued by gunshots. The final scene shows Frank being handed an envelope of cash by Terry Manning in his workplace's car park. As the crime lord drives away he is confronted by a gun-wielding Dekker, who points the gun directly at Manning's face. Manning taunts Dekker, saying \\"You haven't got the bollocks, son\\", to which Dekker smiles menacingly, and pulls the trigger.

The DVD was released on 9 July 2007. Reception Outlaw opened to highly negative reviews from critics upon its release; the Daily Mirror slammed the film, calling it 'simplistic' and 'muddled' and giving it 2/5 and 1/5 in their Friday and Sunday issues respectively. The Guardian described it as \\"ugly, naive and deeply unpleasant: crime-revenge-porn without any style or wit or convincing narrative\\". Ali Catterall of Channel 4 Film described the film as Death Wish written by the Daily Mail.http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=160480 Empire Magazine panned it in their 1 star assessment, stating that the film \\"descends into a sickening sludge of childish politics, brutality and creative swearing\\". In some media outlets, the film has even been described as 'irresponsible' and 'exploitative'. The Independent stated that the film \\"is as unconvincing as it is unpleasant\\" and that it \\"may be a sincere expression of Nick Love's own ambivalence, but it makes for a faltering film.\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/films/reviews/outlaw-18-439795.html Wendy Ide of The Times called it \\"a rage-spewing hate crime of a movie... It‚Äôs not the explicit violence and primal anger that is worrying, it‚Äôs the fact that Love may be tapping into something simmering in the nation‚Äôs psyche. Or worse, inflaming it.\\" As of 2011, Outlaw has a score of 21% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 19 critics. One unlikely outcome of Outlaw's negative critical reception was the cult popularity of a clip featuring director Nick Love and actor Danny Dyer discussing the film's critical mauling, taken from the film's DVD commentary and posted on YouTube. On his blog the comedy writer Graham Linehan called the clip his \\"favourite moment of accidental comedy of the last five years\\" while Guardian newspaper film critic Peter Bradshaw compared Love and Dyer to a real life Derek and Clive.

His contributions to Cantonese opera significantly influenced Hong Kong's reform and development of the genre beginning in the late 1930s. During his twenty- year career, Tang composed over 400 operas and achieved immense popularity within the Cantonese opera scene. He also wrote the film scripts adapted from his own operas, directed the movies and at times acted in them himself. He collapsed in the Lee Theatre and died later in St. Paul's Hospital (Hong Kong). He was survived by his second wife (ÈÑ≠Â≠üÈúûAbout Cheng Meng-har 5 September 2011 as edited by Huang Xia Bo, Cantonese Cinema Study Association (In Chinese Only) of 17 years), their two daughters (ÂîêÊ∑ëÁè†„ÄÅÂîêÊ∑ëÂÑÄ) and two more children (son ÂîêÂØ∂Â†Ø and daughter ÂîêÊ∑ëÂ´ª by his first wife ËñõË¶∫Ê∏Ö of five years). A fifth (irrespective of age) child Cheng mentioned in a 1989 interview, after the passing of Yam Kim Fai, is not listed on Tang's headstone. Early life Tang was born in Heilongjiang province, northeastern China. Upon graduating from the Guangdong Sun Yat-sen Memorial Middle School, Tang reportedly attended the Shanghai Fine Arts School and also the Shanghai Baptist College. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tang fled south to Hong Kong in 1937 where he joined the Kok Sin Sing Opera Troupe (Ë¶∫ÂÖàËÅ≤Á≤µÂäáÂúò) led by his double (cousin) in-law and one of the \\"Four Super Stars\\" Sit Gok Sin (ËñõË¶∫ÂÖà). His first wife was the tenth sister (Sit Gok Ching, ËñõË¶∫Ê∏Ö) of Sit while Sit was married to his paternal first cousin (ÂîêÈõ™Âçø). Tang worked as a copyist and assistant to Fung Chi-fen (È¶ÆÂøóËä¨) and Nam Hoi Sup-sam Long (ÂçóÊµ∑ÂçÅ‰∏âÈÉé), two famous writers for the troupe. Encouraged by Sit Gok Sin, Tang began his career as a playwright in 1938 with his first (being taken as an announcement of his intention to be in the arena) opera The Consoling Lotus of Jiangcheng (). Throughout the next twenty years Tang wrote a total of 446 opera scripts, while 80 of those were adapted for films. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Tang penned many scripts for his wife and her co-stars to stage in return for food (mostly rice) and found his footing eventually. #2 of #30Leaped into fame with the script White Poplar, Red Tears () that Yam Kim Fai found worth \\"giving it a try\\" when script was short in supply. It was first staged by the New Voice Opera Troupe of Yam and then adapted for a film (released 5 March 1950) starring Tang's close personal friend Luo Pinchao. Yam also released a vocal recording of the theme song with a well-known vocalist as the female lead. In total, Tang directed nine films and acted in four of them. His first script for film production was The Tolling Bell (1940) with the help of Ng Cho-fan who in 1989 described how sick Tang looked the afternoon before collapsing in the Lee Theatre. Career Tang started out as in-law of the Sit household. Tang's rise from modesty to greatness went through a process generally taken to have three stages of remarkable improvements. =Initial stage= Ng Cho- fanUpon the divorce in 1941/2, Tang started working mostly with Chan Kam Tong (1906-1981) (Èô≥Èå¶Ê£†) to make ends meet. Chan, the first student of Sit, voted as champion among young warriors by the audience in 1950s, is on record his most frequent customer. There is only one title Red Silk Shoes and The Murder, with no fighting scene at all, Tang wrote for Chan in 1957 is still popular today. =Intermediate stage= The end of Second Sino-Japanese War started the busiest decade, until films took over, of 1900s in Hong Kong and SE Asia as a whole for Cantonese opera. When Tang's work still had plenty of room for improvement, the vocal performances (and fighting scenes which were few and far between in Tang's work) made a big difference. His preference to work with, actresses as female leads over top-billed male leads, were Fong and Hung. His archrival was husband of an actress who is famous for mostly fighting scenes although she was also known by fellow performers as great old- school vocalist as Lady White Snake. Fong and Hung vocal styles were both new creations at the time. The two camps each had a usual venue on opposite side of the HK harbor. Tang worked with musicians/composers below (See .) regularly in 1950s. Only some names are available in English. Except the Chu brothers and those who had already passed away, they talked about Tang on radio shows in 1980s. # ÁéãÁ≤µÁîü (1919‚Äì1989) Wong Yue Sang # ÊûóÂÖÜÈéè (1917‚Äì1979) Lam Siu Lau # Âê≥‰∏ÄÂòØ (1906‚Äì1964) Ng Yat Siu # Êú±ÊØÖÂâõ (1922‚Äì1981) Chu Ngai Kong, brothers # Êú±ÂÖÜÁ•• (1926‚Äì1986) Chu Siu Cheung, brothers # ÂäâÂÖÜÊ¶Æ (1923‚Äì2001) Lau Siu Wing # ÈªéÊµ™ÁÑ∂ (?‚Äì2007) Langran Li (Li was family name)Most widely held works by Langran Li # Èù≥Ê∞∏Ê£† (?‚Äì2004) Kan Wing Tong On 25 August 1989, months before Wong Yue Sang (ÁéãÁ≤µÁîü) (8 January 1919 ‚Äì 12 December 1989) passed away, Mr. Wong talked about his experience working with Tang on radio show (ÂîêÊªåÁîüËóùË°ìËø¥Èüø).

The Summer Snow (see The Injustice to Dou E) #17 of #30 is the last hit collaboration of Fong/Tang and Yam Kim Fai while Hung and Yam stopped sharing the stage much earlier in 1953. His scripts, albeit monolithically Mandarin and Butterfly È¥õÈ¥¶Ëù¥Ëù∂Ê¥æ, gradually matured to making the performers (Êà≤Êìî‰∫∫) successful instead of relying on the performers (‰∫∫ÊìîÊà≤) to make his scripts successful. =Final stage= Tang, in and out of hospital for his heart problem, was rumored to be mixing alcohol with coffee as he encountered writer's block in these four years. Mind over heart? Or heart over mind? He hurried to throw in the kitchen sink. One reason could be that linchpin Yam Kim Fai, after more than 30 years, was ready to quit stage performance entirely especially after some surgeries in 1950s. That is, make or break, time for last call. Tang only worked with those he found worthwhile to spend time and effort on. For example, good vocalist Tam Lan Hing (Ë≠öËò≠Âçø), whose physique was same as the first Mrs. Tang, was never on Tang's radar. At this stage, Tang immersed himself in work to create \\"the perfect (smart, beautiful, educated,...) female lead for the male lead to dive head first for\\" roles for only his favorite few actresses. Audience was led to admire, respect, love, .., pity, feel sorry for the noble/honorable female characters he wrote. What's leftover for the male lead to make do with gave them very few \\"roles of a lifetime\\". In 1990, one columnist wondered why ladies in the audience would be hooked to the male lead character and eventually also to the performer personally.The Man from The Peony Pavilion by Chow Yiu Fai 23 March 1990 „ÄêHong Kong Economic Journal„Äë (In Chinese Only) Influenced by Cheng Meng-har Born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, Cheng Meng-har was an accomplished Chinese opera performer (in Shanghai, China) long before Tang started diving into some of his most famous career choices. A ‚Äò‚Äôin Cantonese‚Äô‚Äô only radio show had a complete account of Tang‚Äôs life and work, from birth to death. Other than personal hygiene (taking a bath or not), lifestyle and family, major contributions in several aspects the second Mrs. Tang made are:- Generally * Scripts :*before 1954 :Stage craft in the form of Patterned Performance Segments (ÊéíÂ†¥). (That is, the essential training for performers when only the plots were provided. Well-established before complete scripts were ever written for performers.) :*since 1954 :#Intellectual appeal improved :#More sophisticated, less slapstick :#Drawn from Chinese classics and poetry that they found in junk yards *Contacts #Instead of travelling like Hung and Sit had to, Cantonese opera performers were introduced to assorted Chinese opera performers in Hong Kong by Cheng. #Ma Lianliang was in Hong Kong briefly and met with Lang Chi Bak who talked about the occasion in 1986 on radio. #Others, particularly those Mei Lanfang related, stayed behind and were fully engaged for decades as tutors and mentors. *Costume :Hand-embroidered (Su Xiu, Suzhou embroidery crafted in areas around Suzhou, Jiangsu Province) instead of shimmering Sequin Title specific *Mistake at the Flower Festival :Beijing- style acrobatics in shoe-making scene *The Reincarnation of a Beauty :Ghost- walking acrobatics (rigor mortis state of human body projected) after breaking out of the coffin in rescue the scholar scene Roles as Mid to Late Teens In 1959, Yam edited as she saw fit when she chaired the script- review sessions with six pillars and Tang at the table. Photograph recorded this scene with Lam Kar Sing in it. The audience laughed out loud when a female lead delivered her line about her character being 15/16 years old only in some of the biggest stage productions in 2000s Hong Kong. The costume design, bag lady in high price fabric, did not provide the kind of support needed to fight gravity and therefore did not help either. For male leads, the lack of precision about age generally makes it less offensive to audience when actors (actresses mind their figures more) in those male lead roles show their pot belly on stage if they still have all the other essential qualities such as good vocal performances. Tang botched a few times before finding his footing and came up with his life's work, in very quick succession (compared to Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and Alexandre Dumas, fils), those titles now represent Tang in Cantonese opera.

In 1959, Yam was photographed with a pen in hand reviewing Tang's last title, with the second male lead for debut, Lam Kar Sing, and Tang at the table. Yam and Loong, her successor, had demonstrated how little difference it made when they each had different co-stars in these titles known as the BIG FOUR. (A Romance of Pear Blossoms is sometimes known as one of the BIG FIVE.) Repertoire by chronological order of debut:- * The Peony Pavilion (1956) (see Tang Xianzu) : According to Hong Kong Movie DataBase (HKMDB), Pak Yin (Chinese: ÁôΩÁáï) played Du Liniang (Chinese: ÊùúÈ∫óÂ®ò), as the lead actress in two Cantonese films. Both historical period dramas were adapted version of this story. Tang started his own piece later in 1956. :: In The Peony Pavilion (1940), Cheung Ying (Chinese: ÂºµÁëõ) played the male lead Liu Mengmei (Chinese: Êü≥Â§¢Ê¢Ö). :: In Beauty Raised from the Dead (1956), set in \\"Late Qing Dynasty and Early Republic of China\\", Cheung Wood-yau (Chinese: ÂºµÊ¥ªÊ∏∏) played the male lead Liu Mengmei (Chinese: Êü≥Â§¢Ê¢Ö). Tang borrowed the ending plot in this film as the magical ending for his last piece in 1959. :::Cheung Wood-yau worked closely with Tang and his wife in Hong Kong throughout 1942 to 1945 on stage as a Cantonese opera performer. He played Jia Baoyu in a 1949 film, shortly after the war and before the era of \\"separation of cinema and opera\\" movement. :::Cantonese opera as his background, first and foremost career choice, was not widely known. Neither well-known fact is he finished training school around the same time as Luo Pinchao and Lau Hak Suen, a follower of Ma Sze Tsang singing style. :::With a physique very different from the beginning of his career or in 1949, he returned to his root in those few years to make quite a few operatic films with Tsi Law-lin, Mui Yee and Hung Sin Nui. These are the only record of his operatic performance. * A Romance of Pear Blossoms (1957) : One of two (Mistake at the Flower Festival was the other one.) titles written specifically for Chinese New Year celebration season : Red for luck and fortune instead of blue or white (both mostly represent sad occasions in Chinese culture) : Only one among these five in which the male lead was front and center : First among these five to achieve recognition in terms of box- office and profitability : Saving grace for the female lead and her otherwise never existed career : Script (Act I in particular) was weak : Came back 28 years later in November 1985 with the male lead character portrayed on stage again (the audience really liked the production, total 28 sold-out performances) * Di N√º Hua (1957) * The Purple Hairpin (1957) (see Tang Xianzu) : At the night of 10th full house, Tang wrote how uneasy he felt. > „ÄåÁ¥´ÈáµË®òÈÄ£ÊªøÂçÅÊôö ÂøÉÁ•ûÂèçÊÉ¥ÊÉ¥‰∏çÂÆâ ÂÜçËá®ÈöãÊô∫Ê∞∏ÂçÉÂ≠óÊñáÁúüÊõ∏‰∏ÄÈÅé‰ª•È§äÊÄßÊÄ°ÊÉÖ ËÄå‰∏ãÁ≠ÜÂ∏∏Êúâ‰ªø‰Ωõ‰πãÊÑü Âõ∫Áü•Ê∞£Áá•ÊÄßÊµÆ Â∞öÈ†àÂã§Êñº‰øÆÈ§ä‰πüÊªåÁîüË≠ò„Äç : At the night of 14th full house, Tang wrote how he was not himself. > „ÄåÁ¥´ÈáµË®òÂ∑≤ËÑ´Á®ø‰ªäÊºîËá≥Á¨¨ÂçÅÂõõÊôö‰ªçËÉΩÊªøÂ∫ß ‰ΩÜÂøÉÁ•ûÊ¨†‰Ω≥ ÊÉ¥ÊÉ¥ÁÑ∂‰∏çÁü•ÊâÄÂõ† Ëá®Á±≥Êµ∑Â∂ΩË∑ãÊ≤≥Âçó ÊëπËò≠‰∫≠ÁµπÊú¨ÁúüË∑° ‰∫¶ÊúâÊâã‰∏çÂæûÂøÉ‰πãÊÑü Ë™†ÁÇ∫Â≠´ÈÅéÂ∫≠Êõ∏Ë≠úÊúâË®ÄÊÑè > ÈÅïÂã¢Â±àÁÑâËÉΩÁ®±ÊÑè‰πü„Äç On air for the 50th anniversary of Tang's passing, Lau Tin Chi (ÂäâÂ§©Ë≥ú) commented in 2009 how \\"unreasonably grumpy, ill-tempered ()\\" the debut female lead had been in this character to him. * The Reincarnation of a Beauty (1959) : At the night of Ng Cho-fandebut, Tang collapsed and died later in hospital. : Tang was under undue stress, against medical advice, while demand was high and non- stop. His hands were forced by the debut female lead who booked Lee Theatre without Tang's agreement to have this title ready. : According to Cheng Meng- har, Tang wanted to quit as a Cantonese opera playwright. : Many sudden deaths () related to this title have been reported throughout the six decades since debut. ::Troupe manager, Xu See (), Hong Kong, 1979 (brother of Cantonese opera playwright Xu Ruodai, author of Dream of Red Chamber throughout the 1940s in Macau) ::Composer, Chu Ngai Kong (), Singapore, 23 June 1981Page 26, Sin Chew Jit Poh () 27 June 1981 Yam (in 1968) and then Loong (since 1972) took these four titles along with many other titles of Tang all around the world, including Vietnam (1972) and Las Vegas (1982). However, their reputation as iconic started in mid-1970s. In those years since the 1970 grinding halt, Cantonese film productions in Hong Kong were few and far between. Loong and fellow classmates were limited by design to play characters in these four only and none others, in order to boost the status of these titles of teachers. (This is very common among Yam's generation of performers. Those grew up in the 1960s in Hong Kong keep this running in full force on various platforms funded by the general public, particularly those more talented students, to promote teachers' own status.) Yam had much more under her belt beyond these but other teachers were not in the same shoes. Fame came much faster and through wider audience from cinemas than theaters. Loong's first film as male lead was, except for Yam who made it happen, an unexpected hit. The grand plan came only since then. It started with Di N√º Hua (the 1976 version) directed by John Woo and ended with the next low-budget production by director Lee Tit. Lee wanted to make The Peony Pavilion (1956) in 1975 but in vain. Being under the weather in 1976, Yam neither monitored the work of Lee nor found the result satisfactory after it was all said and done. Egoism, copyrights and profitability led to wars among studios/directors/producers/copyright-holders. Yam put an end to all related activities. Loong's loyalty to Yam (and therefore stage productions) was tested. Loong sent the offer of \\"HK$100,000 per film\\" right back to Yam. That stopped the yet-to-be-named person in his track. Director Kong Lung () talked about his desire related to The Reincarnation of a Beauty (1959) in 1989. Characteristics of the BIG FOUR (FIVE) are:- 1). Main characters:- :Male leads - multi-faceted but always a loyal lover :Female leads - hubris, contrary to introverted (back then generally accepted quality in a good woman) and audience did not care for her performance in the 1956 flop Dream of Red Chamber () 2). Plot good in structure and logic :All are adaptations of existing Chinese opera stories from authors before Tang instead of his own creation. 3). Polished and well crafted lines/lyrics :Lesson learnt from Sun Yim Yeung Troupe. 4). Melodies and scores well-received :Wong Yue Sang (see #1 above) and Chu Ngai Kong (see #4 above) came up with most of the well-known pieces. :Mr. Wong Sum FanFamous songwriters such as Wong Sum-fan, Ng Yat-siu and Wu Man-sum emerged in this period. (ÁéãÂøÉÂ∏Ü 1896 to August, 1992Ôºâ refused to write lyrics, disliking those easy to sing modern melodies not written by the two above. (traditional versus easy for beginners, not veterans like Yam who can sing in a different way each and every time, to sing = Ê¢ÜÈªÉ/Â∞èÊõ≤\\"Êòì‰∏äÂè£\\") 5). Glamorous setting and costumes to match :Enticing to first time theatre-goers who are not knowledgeable. Especially when compared to rags to riches of The Story of the Lute which is known as the favorite of many performers. Glamor is opposite to tradition. Chinese opera (X√¨q«î) has been relying on no more than a table and two chairs as support for travelling performers with storylines, voices and skills to hold the audience's attention. Yam, for example, has been called the prevailing performer as (ËêΩÊãìÁ™ÆÈÖ∏Êõ∏Áîü) a scholar in rags. It was believed glamorous/fancy costume, just like fancy vocal style, would have made Yam less manly. 6). Big casts :For example, Lam Kar Sing, the successor of Sit, along Leung Sing Bor and Lang Chi Bak. Most important was Yam Kim Fai as male lead exclusively on stage while Yam still worked with other co-stars in films. Why Not Return? in 1958 was also a breakthrough for Lam Kar Sing starring his first film, a Sit classic legacy title, opposite Fong (instead of a classmate). These four performers were also what some called \\"film distributors could take to the bank\\". 7). Rehearsals :Follow the Sit tradition to rehearse till confident about hitting the ground running at debut. Sit worked with many new members of his troupes for various reasons. The rehearsals became essential for these new performers to make less mistakes under the circumstances. Audience in the past, according to one veteran (Huang Junlin ÈªÉÂêõÊûó), expressed their disapproval by throwing mud towards the stage. :The female lead in all those Big Four/Five is known as very immature and unable to perform well without enough rehearsals. She also was never a co-star of Sit while some of the generation after her were. :The level of maturity Yam has achieved after years of struggle is well-known. With highly accomplished and superb opera acting skills, she knows how to improvise if it should become necessary. Such a stage demeanor can only be projected by a veteran virtuoso opera performer.Yam Kim-fai centenary celebration at HK Film Archive Press Releases, HKSAR, 28 December 2012 8). Sing and dance but duet instead of solo :See musical theatre ‚Äì Tang's solution when the female lead could neither measure up to Fong/Hung nor hold her own court with vocal performances. (For example, from the January The Story of the Lute all the way up against September The Summer Snow in 1956.) While some, LGBT or not, in the audience enjoyed the arousing singing of the female lead, some (conservatives ËâØÂÆ∂Â©¶Â•≥) opined that noises she made were obscene. 9). Hanky-panky :Without being pornographic or scandalous, hanky-panky of some sort, of two actresses.Â•≥Êà≤Áè≠ÈõôÂüéË®ò ÊñáÔºöÂáåÂØß „ÄêË≥áÊñô‰æÜÊ∫ê : ÊòüÂ≥∂Êó•Â†±„Äë Shippers like Natalia Chan had expressed their 360 degree fantasy such as \\"too bad they don't....\\" while two sisters had a plan for their own boy toy. Ban on actors/actresses sharing the stage was lifted about 20 years before this. The interaction on stage between actors (or actress like Yam) in male lead roles and actresses in female lead roles were very modest. 10). Happy ending (meet-date-marry-reunion in heaven if not on earth) Roles as Mature with Life Experience Tang chaired the script-review sessions with the six pillars. Ng Kwun Lai was an up-and-coming performer who just hit big with her martial agility in the breakthrough role of Leang Hung- yuk (meaning Red Jade) in How Liang Hongyu's War Drum Caused the Jin Army to Retreat (1956) when Tang was ready to help her excel as \\"verdant-robed girls\\" (qingyi). To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Tang's passing, Ng (without any successor to carry water for her) put five titles of their collaboration on stage in Hong Kong City Hall from 4 to 8 in June 1989. The female leads, not described as particularly lovable, in these five titles go through life starting out young or already married with a son while the male leads (both primary and secondary) had major interactions between themselves. Cast for debut were all actors who could hold their own courts. No successors to those actors however spent time on these titles as Loong did for Yam's legacy titles. That may explain the relative lack of popularity compared to the BIG FOUR. Original male lead for most of these titles was Ho Fei Fan, a well-known vocalist who held his own court and one of the very few actors who successfully portrayed Jia Baoyu. In The Blessings of the Moon, the original scene when male and female leads meet, date and get engaged has been replaced by a clean version for the male lead (a scholar) to look more decent in the minds of actors who picked up the baton since Ho. Actors of a generation (known to have extramarital affairs or as adulterers off stage), except only one recently, found such move of a hot-blooded young man, a scholar, to be scandalous. Hard to tell if a scholar's mind in the gutter or those actors' minds in the gutter was the true reason. It was confirmed to be the later in 2018 by Law Kar Ying. Copyright In addition to the usual one time payment from Yam, Loong provided ex-gratia payments of a few thousand dollars each year for Tang's family as a friendly gesture for years. In 1990, not long since the passing of Yam,the second Mrs. Tang sold copyright of about 34Transaction related to copyrights titles, mostly those Loong performed over the years, for a 6-figure sum in HK$, contrary to the gentleman's agreement Tang made with his customers regularly as a librettist. (If HK$100,000, it would be about HK$10,000 each year for the rest of her life.) In mid-1980, Loong wrote about her conflicting emotions being the lucky one carrying the torch, probably only because Tang passed away so young. A simple way to put it, but not her words, could be: > „ÄåÁîüÁ¨ô‰∏çË≠òÔºåÁîüÁîü‰∏çÁÜÑÔºÅ„Äç Book deals, interviews on TV or radio, by the Press in general, academics' researches, former acquaintances, etc. became the livelihood of those, pedestrian A, not even remotely related to Tang. Instead of stealing Tang's bowl of thunder, they became known informally as something like Tang Scholars instead of successors of the sort that could come up with more decent opera scripts. In 2009, Yuen opined that Loong was the only performer of their generation could have put another librettist on the map. Unfortunately, that could have happened only if Loong were not required to stay with all the Tang's titles, good or bad, since debut as career performer. The attempts to breakthrough were resisted, in no bigger way than: # 1982 The Story of Emperor Li production, Loong's successful attempt to break that mold (Only Loong's second parents supported her. Luo Pinchao commented on the debut but Yam refrained from doing so and gave a cryptic response when asked by the Press.

To people around Tang beyond immediate family, they benefited from what could be exhibit A for > \\"...worth more dead than alive.\\" ‚Äì quote from Death of a Salesman Fong Yim Fun appeared to be the only performer who managed her collaborations with Tang best by getting the film rights and making the films as many times as she wanted to her satisfaction. Lam Kar Sing also appeared to have learnt from Fong when he kept most of his collaborations with librettists published in his troupe's name. On the contrary, Loong was made to record CD for free for librettist in 1980 and could not get other CDs made on her own with that librettist's approval. However, said librettist renamed the pieces and sold them as many times as he wanted on top of royalty payments (1% ?). (Double- dipping:- # Tang did split some titles into two. That is, same story (with even same names for characters) sometimes for one troupe in Hong Kong while the other troupe performed in Vietnam, per Ng Kwun Lai. A Wife in Nobility is Never Free (‰∏ÄÂÖ•‰æØÈñÄÊ∑±‰ººÊµ∑) and Marrying the Sister-in-Law (ÂÜç‰∏ñÈáçÊ∫´ÈáëÈ≥≥Á∑£) may be another example of legitimate twins since they are both Fong's work but decades apart by Tang. The clean version of Yam's The Marriage of Tang Bohu renamed as The Marriage of Three Smiles (‰∏âÁ¨ëÂßªÁ∑£) for Loong is also well-known. A few evil doubles have no such proofs and therefore are not necessarily legitimate twins. For example, same plot, lines, lyrics and names for characters in contemporary opera title Heaven Brought Us Together (Â§©Ë≥úËâØÁ∑£) instead of using those titles on records, Loong's A Phoenix in Springtime (ÈáëÈ≥≥ËøéÊò•) or Yam's The Merry Phoenix (ÂΩ©È≥≥ÂñúËøéÊò•). # Ex-gratia payments, an honor for Loong, was confirmed by the second Mrs. Tang on radio in 1980s but never reported by publications from very serious academics or pedestrian A.

The Kenyah people, traditionally being swidden agriculturalists and living in longhouses (uma dado'), is an umbrella term for over 40 sub-groups that mostly share common migration histories, customs and related dialects. Kenyah people lived in longhouses in a small communities. Each longhouse consists of families who choose their own leader (headman). When they have any event or celebration such as harvest festival they will normally use the longhouse verandah (oseh bi'o) to gather and deliver speeches to guide their youngsters. Normally this harvest festival celebration (tau bio Ramay o o Ajau, pelepek uman) is a major festival because most of them are still farmers. Kenyah people are very creative and they also have composed their popular songs and melody such as Lan e Tuyang, Kendau bimbin, Ilu Kenyah Kua Lo Te'a, Pabat Pibui, Atek Lan and Leleng Oyau Along Leleng. Popular traditional Kenyah musical instruments are such as jatung utang (wooden xylophone), sampe (a type of guitar), sampe bio (single stringed bass), lutong (a four- to six-string bamboo tube zither) and keringut (nose flute).  Religion  Christianity is the predominant religion of Kenyah people, with the majority belonging to the Evangelical Protestanism. Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Kenyah people practice a traditional form of animism called 'Adat Pu'un'. During the initial introduction of Christianity by Christian & Missionary Alliance and Borneo Evangelical Mission, the traditional belief and practices was revitalized and this form was called 'Bungan Malan Peselong Luan' movement. However, today are only a small number of Kenyah people who still practice the Bungan faith. It is believed that a person will ascend to Alo Malau (seven heavens) with their ancestors (tepun) after death.  Population  Statistical figures, based on the Indonesian and Malaysian national censuses collected in 2000, recorded a total of 44,350 Kenyah people in East Kalimantan, Indonesia and 24,906 in Sarawak, Malaysia.See 2000 National Census, Jawatan Perangkaan Malaysia, 2000 and 2000 Population Census /Sensus Penduduk 2000, Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia, 2000  Sub-ethnic groups  The Kenyah people are also divided into various sub-ethnic groups such as:- *Kenyah Badeng or Madang *Kenyah Bakung *Kenyah Jamok *Kenyah Lepo' Abong *Kenyah Lepo' Aga *Kenyah Lepo' Anan *Kenyah Lepo' Bam *Kenyah Lepo' Gah *Kenyah Lepo' Jalan *Kenyah Lepo' Ke' *Kenyah Lepo' Kulit *Kenyah Lepo' Maut *Kenyah Lepo' Sawa' *Kenyah Lepo' Tau' *Kenyah Lepo' Tepu *Kenyah Lepo' Timai *Kenyah Long Ulai *Kenyah Long Sebatu *Kenyah Long Belukun *Kenyah Long Tikan * Kenyah Uma' Bangan *Kenyah Uma' Baka *Kenyah Uma' Kelep *Kenyah Uma' Lasan *Kenyah Uma' Lung *Kenyah Uma' Pawa' *Kenyah Uma' Sambop *Kenyah Uma' Tukung  Origins  Kenyah architecture, circa 1898-1900.

The site was originally a residence of Emperor Saga (785‚Äì842 CE), and later various emperor conducted their cloistered rule from here. The Saga Go-ry≈´ school of ikebana has its headquarters in the temple. The artificial lake of the temple, ≈åsawa Pond, is one of the oldest Japanese garden ponds to survive from the Heian period.Young and Young, The Art of the Japanese Garden, pg. 72 History Emperor Saga The origins of the temple dates back to the Heian period in the year 814 CE, when Emperor Saga had a palace, known as the Saga-in, constructed on the site. The palace later became his seat of retirement, known as Saga Rikyu imperial villa.Young and Young, pg. 72 According to tradition, when Japan suffered a serious epidemic, the Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, suggested that the Emperor Saga personally copy an important Buddhist religious document called the Heart Sutra (Hannya Shingy≈ç). The emperor made a handwritten copy, and the epidemic is said to have ended. The handwritten sutra is kept at the Shingy≈çden hall of the temple, and is displayed to the public once every sixty years, the next time being in 2018. Pilgrims still come to the temple to make copies of the sutra, which are kept in the temple with the original.Young and Young, pg. 72 In 876, thirty-four years after the death of Emperor Saga, his daughter Princess Masako (Ê≠£Â≠êÂÜÖË¶™Áéã; 810‚Äì879), who was consort of Emperor Junna, turned the complex into a temple and gave it the name Daikaku-ji.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794‚Äì1869, p. 112. It was a monzeki temple (ÈñÄË∑°), which means by tradition that only imperial princes were appointed abbot of the temple.About Daikakuji Over the years, it became the retirement home of several emperors. In the 13th and 14th centuries the temple became the residence of retired emperors such as Emperor Go-Saga, Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Go-Uda, who could be ordained as monks, but continued to wield power in what became known as cloistered rule. In 1336, during the upheaval between the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, the temple burned down, but was later rebuilt. During the Edo period, Emperor Go-Mizunoo brought in Momoyama period buildings from the Kyoto Imperial Palace. The temple was placed in a graveled courtyard next to the pond. The hond≈ç, or main hall, and the Founder's Hall were also moved from the Kyoto Imperial Palace.Young and Young, p. 72‚Äì73 The main images are of the Five Wisdom Kings, centered on Fud≈ç. The sliding door painting in the Okanmuri-no-ma room of the Sh≈çshinden were painted by Kan≈ç Sanraku and Shik≈ç Watanabe. They feature peony trees and red and white plum blossoms. The hawk painted with Indian ink is a unique motif. The wooden beam above the doors has a painting of a hare. All these works of art are designated as Important Cultural Properties. Tsujii K≈çsh≈´ (Ëæª‰∫ïÂºòÊ¥≤) (born 1872), who was one of Ohara Unshin's disciples from the Ohara-ry≈´ school of ikebana, established his own school in the early part of the Taish≈ç era.Minobu Ohi. History of Ikebana. Shufunotomo, Tokyo. 1962 He was invited by Daikaku-ji to set up the Saga Go-ry≈´ school in 1936.https://mikatsujii.com/kadotext.html  Pond and garden The ≈åsawa Pond and surrounding garden date back to the Heian period The ≈åsawa Pond is older than the temple itself. It is an artificial lake of 2.4 hectares that was created by Emperor Saga, either during his reign (809-823) or between his retirement from power and his death in 842. The pond is supposed to reflect the outlines of Dongting Lake in China, which has a special significance in Chinese culture. It was an imperial garden of the style known as chisen-shuyu: a garden meant to be seen from a boat, similar to the Imperial Chinese garden of the period. The lake was created by damming a stream which came from the Nakoso waterfall. At the north end of the pond are two islands, one large and one small - the small island being known as Chrysanthmum Island. Between the two islands are several small rocky islets, meant to resemble Chinese junks at anchor. On a hillside north of the lake is what appears to be a dry cascade (karedaki), a kind of Japanese rock garden or zen garden, where a real waterfall is suggested by a composition of stones. The garden was celebrated in the poetry of the period. A poem by Ki no Tomonori in an anthology from the period, the Kokinsh≈´, described the Kiku-shima, or island of chrysanthemums, found in the ≈åsawa pond. :I had thought that here :only one chrysanthemum can grow. :Who therefore has planted :the other in the depths :of the pond of ≈åsawa? Another poem of the Heian period, in the Hyakunin isshu, described a cascade of rocks, which simulated a waterfall, in the same garden: :The cascade long ago :ceased to roar, :But we continue to hear :The murmur :of its name.Nitschke, Le Jardin Japonais, p. 42. Excerpts translated from French by DR Siefkin. The pond and the flowers are therefore by tradition to said to be the birthplace of the Saga school of ikebana, which is named in honour of the emperor.Ikebana The lake was created as a particularly good place for viewing the rising of the moon from boats. It also became, and remains, a popular place for viewing the cherry trees in bloom around the lake. A moon-viewing party is held in the garden every autumn for three days, around the date of the harvest moon; it features costumed dancers and musicians and dragon boats in the style of the Heian period. Today the lake is a popular park for the city's residents. In addition to the garden around the lake, there is a large courtyard garden between the buildings of the temple.Young and Young, pp. 72‚Äì73.

He was born in Pat√π, near Santa Maria di Leuca (Apulia), then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He studied at Lecce and graduated in law at Naples, soon beginning to teach in the same university. Frequenting the Carbonari, Romano adhered to the Risorgimento ideals. In 1820 he took part to the riots against the Neapolitan government, being imprisoned and exiled. In 1848 he returned to Naples and was instrumental in the events leading King Ferdinand II to issue a Constitution. On 15 May 1848 Romano was again arrested and condemned to death, but managed to turn it into exile, moving to Montpellier in France. Romano returned in 1854. Six years later, with Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand ongoing, he was appointed Prefect of Police by King Francis II. While Garibaldi's victories were nearing the end of the Kingdom, on 14 July 1860 he was named Minister of the Interior and Police: Romano, realising the inevitability of the end, began secret contacts with Count Cavour, the Piedmontese Prime Minister, and Garibaldi, preparing the switching of southern Italy into Savoy's hands. He suggested to King Francis that he move to the fortress of Gaeta, in order to avoid riots, destruction and useless suffering to the Neapolitan population. When Garibaldi entered Naples, Romano was confirmed as Minister of the Interiors. In January 1861 the first general elections of the newborn Kingdom of Italy were held, and Romano was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, where he remained until 1865.

It is also the oldest working lighthouse in East Anglia. History The building was constructed in 1790 as one of a pair of candle-powered lights (\\"High Lighthouse\\" and \\"Low Lighthouse\\"). In 1801 candle power gave way to oil lamps and reflectors. In 1863 the lantern stage (the top-most part of the tower) was replaced with the diagonally-framed glass structure seen today (which was a new innovation at the time) and four years later the reflectors were replaced in each lighthouse by a large (first-order) catadioptric lens designed by James Chance. In 1871 Happisburgh's lighthouses were used for a series of trials comparing a Douglass 4-wick oil light (displayed from the low lighthouse) with a Wigham 108-jet gas light (displayed from the high lighthouse) both using the same optics; the experiments (which tested rival claims made by the principal advocates of these forms of illumination, James Nicholas Douglass and John Richardson Wigham respectively) were not conclusive and further trials later took place at South Foreland. In order to provide a supply of coal gas for the lamp, a small gas works was established alongside the high lighthouse; the gas was manufactured using cannel coal and stored in a pair of gas holders situated behind the lighthouse. In 1872, the trial having concluded, it was decided to retain gas as the illuminant for the high lighthouse, and later the supply was extended to the low lighthouse which was provided with a similar burner. Beyond Happisburgh, however, Trinity House did not adopt gas as an illuminant for its lighthouses. The low light was decommissioned and demolished in 1883 before it could be lost due to coastal erosion; its lantern and lens were reused at Southwold lighthouse.Point 2 - The Lighthouse, BBC Suffolk. Retrieved 2012-10-29. The demolition of the low light led to the High Light being repainted with red bands, so as to differentiate it more clearly from the lighthouse at Winterton; at the same time it was also provided with an occulting mechanism to differentiate the light itself. The light source was changed to paraffin in 1910, and then to an automated acetylene system in 1929; this meant that there was no further need for keepers to be permanently accommodated on site, and the keepers' cottages were then sold. In 1947 the light was electrified and given a new group flashing characteristic: three flashes ever 30 seconds. The tower is tall, putting the lantern at above sea level.\\"Lighthouses of the World & Fog Signals\\" - Alexander Finlay, Richard Holmes Laurie, 1888 The lighthouse is painted white with three red bands and has a light characteristic of Fl(3)30s (three white flashes, repeated every 30 seconds) at a height of with a range of . It continues to use the optic installed in 1868. The other lighthouse - the \\"low light\\" - was lower. Together they formed a pair of range lights that marked a safe passage around the southern end of the offshore Haisborough Sands to a stretch of safe waters known as 'The Would'.Happisburgh Village Website - History of Happisburgh Lighthouse Independence In 1987 Happisburgh was one of five lighthouses declared redundant by Trinity House and deactivation was planned for June 1988. Villagers organised a petition to oppose the closure, and as a result the date was postponed. Under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894,Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, part XI (p. 260 of the PDF version) Trinity House may dispose of a working lighthouse only to an established Lighthouse Authority. On 25 April 1990 the Happisburgh Lighthouse ActHappisburgh Lighthouse Act as annotation C9 modification of Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 received the Royal Assent establishing the Happisburgh Lighthouse Trust as a Local Light Authority, and Happisburgh became the only independently run operational lighthouse in Great Britain. In June 2018, the lighthouse was repainted. At a cost of ¬£20,000, the work took two weeks by a specialist team of four painters. The 300 litres of specially mixed masonry paints used was donated by a paint company.

Located in Fengtai District, south of the 4th Ring Road and from Tiananmen Square, Nanyuan Airport was first opened in 1910, making it the oldest airport in China. It was the main hub of China United Airlines. Nanyuan Airport ceased civil operation on 25 September 2019, after all flights were moved to the newly opened Beijing Daxing International Airport. History The first aircraft landed in the Nanyuan area was in 1904. In July 1907, the government built rudimentary runways in Nanyuan's Yijun training ground (also known as the Wulidian soldier training ground) and used it for a light aircraft purchased from France. In August 1910, the Qing government began to establish air transportation in China, with the built of a factory in Nanyuan to experiment with manufacturing aircraft, the Nanyuan airport officially opened its regular use. Nanyuan airport was the first airport in China and one of the three operational airports opened before 1910s in the world. After the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan Shikai, who followed suggestions from the French advisers, established the first official flying academy in China in 1913: Nanyuan Flying Academy, with Li Ruyan as chief, and purchased 10 French Caudron trainer aircraft for 300,000 silver dollars. After the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, the academy was closed. However, the more than 100 pilots that trained in the academy over 4 terms have played important roles in China's aviation history. Later on, some of them has become key persons in civil aviation. During the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Army extended the airport, upgraded its air traffic control facilities, and changed the name to Nanyuan military camp. After the Surrender of Japan in 1945, Nanyuan Airport has become one of the most important airports for the Nationalist government and its air force. The private planes of Chiang Kai- shek and Fu Zuoyi have taken off from the Nanyuan Airport; many of Kuomintang's important military and government personnels have also boarded flights from Nanyuan. There was also an aviation accident happened at the airport in 1945. During 1946 United States Marine Corps fighter squadron VMF-218 was based here. in December 1948, the People's Liberation Army took control of the airport. In August 1949, the first flying brigade of the People's Liberation Army Air Force was formed in here, and they participated in the People's Republic of China Founding Ceremony's flying missions. Since then, Nanyuan Airport has been supporting the training of air and ground forces in all of the subsequent National Day Show of Force events. In 1986, China United Airlines was established as a military-owned civil airline with special authorization to use military airports.
