In electoral systems which use ranked voting, a donkey vote is a cast ballot where the voter ranks the candidates based on the order they appear on the ballot itself. The voter that votes in this manner is referred to as a donkey voter. Typically, this involves numbering the candidates in the order they appear on the ballot paper: first preference for the first-listed candidate, second preference for the second-listed candidate, and so on. However, donkey votes can also occur in reverse, such that someone numbers the candidates from the bottom up the ballot paper. In systems where a voter is required to place a number against each candidate for the vote to be valid, the voter may give the first preference to the candidate they prefer, then run all the other numbers donkey fashion. Donkey votes are most common where preference voting is combined with compulsory voting, such as in Australia, particularly where all candidates must be ranked on the ballot paper. There are different versions of the phenomenon applicable in the Australian House of Representatives, Australian Senate and in the Australian jurisdictions that use the Hare–Clark single transferable vote (STV) system. Donkey votes may occur for several reasons, including voter apathy, protest voting, simplicity on how-to-vote cards, the complexity of the voting system, or voter ignorance of the voting system rules. Alternatively, what appears as a donkey vote may in fact be a genuine representation of a voter's preferences. Manifestation in compulsory preferential voting systemsAustralian House of Representatives= Preferential voting for a single seat is used in elections for the Federal House of Representatives (since 1918), for all mainland State lower houses, and for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It was also used for the Western Australian Legislative Council until 1986, and the Victorian Legislative Council until 2006; it is still used for the Tasmanian Legislative Council. A variant was used for the South Australian Legislative Council before 1973, with two seats per \\"province\\" (electoral district) being filled at each election, but by majority-preferential voting, not by proportional representation. The donkey vote has been estimated at between 1 and 2% of the vote, which could be critical in a marginal seat.Malcolm Mackerras, The \\"Donkey Vote\\", The Australian Quarterly, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 1968), pp. 89-92 Attempt to reduce the impact of donkey votes In 1983, reforms were made to Federal electoral legislation to reduce the impact of donkey voting including: * listing of party names besides each candidate (as for the examples below for the Divisions of Gwydir and Grayndler); * the order of candidates on the ballot paper being decided randomly by the Australian Electoral Commission returning officer after the close of nominations and the commencement of pre-poll voting – candidates were previously listed by alphabetical order leading to parties nominating candidates with names beginning with A. These reforms as well as an increase in electoral education funding have reduced the impact of donkey voting in Federal elections in recent years. As states have introduced similar reforms, the phenomenon has also been reduced in other jurisdictions. However, donkey voting still needs to be taken into account when assessing the size of the swing or two-party vote in particular electorates. 2005 Werriwa By-Election The by- election for the Federal electorate of Werriwa, held on 19 March 2005, following the resignation of Federal Labor leader Mark Latham, provides a good example for understanding the nature of donkey voting. At this by-election, 16 candidates were nominated. This large number of candidates led to an increased incentive to cast a donkey vote. Every candidate that issued how-to-vote cards used some variation of the donkey vote when instructing his or her voters how to mark preferences, presumably to simplify the task of voting, made onerous by needing to vote for 16 candidates, many with no public profile. Candidates generally allocated their first few preferences and last few preferences to candidates according to their wishes, then numbered the rest of the boxes from top to bottom or bottom to top. For example, The Greens advocated the following preferences: * 15 Woodger, Janey (Australians Against Further Immigration) * 1 Raue, Ben (The Greens) * 14 Young, James (Independent) * 13 Lees, Mal (Independent) * 3 Hayes, Chris (Australian Labor Party) * 12 Vogler, Robert (Independent) * 11 Tan, Greg (Christian Democratic Party) * 10 Bryant, Joe (Independent) * 16 Doggett, Charles (One Nation) * 9 Head, Mike * 8 Sykes, Mick (Family First) * 7 Bargshoon, Sam (Independent) * 2 McGookin, Pat (Progressive Labour Party) * 6 Locke, Deborah * 5 Aussie- Stone, Marc (Independent) * 4 Mannoun, Ned In this case, the how-to-vote card advocated a first preference for the Greens, a second preference for the Progressive Labour Party, a third preference for Labor and a last preference for One Nation. Apart from these preferences, the card advocates a reverse Donkey Vote. The donkey vote was also reflected in the high vote (4.83%) for Australians Against Further Immigration, who probably would normally gain far fewer votes, but were placed first on the ballot. =Australian Senate= The Australian Senate had a preferential system between 1919 and 1949. From 1934, to elect a State's three senators at a periodic Senate poll, voters had to mark their preference order among the candidates listed on the ballot paper against the names of each of the candidates (with consecutive integers beginning from 1). Candidates could be listed in groups, but voters could choose any order of candidates regardless of their grouping, because Section 7 of the Constitution provides that senators must be directly chosen by the people. Within each group, the candidates were listed in alphabetical order, and the groups were listed in what was called 'ranked alphabetical order', which ensured that a group in which all surnames started with 'A' would be at the top of the ballot paper if there were no other group with that feature. The groups were not identified by a party name, but just shown as Group A, Group B, etc. Donkey voters, by definition, marked their earliest preferences against the candidates in Group A, so a group that appeared in that position had an inbuilt electoral advantage. At the election of senators for New South Wales in 1937, Labor's group featured four candidates named Amour, Ashley, Armstrong and Arthur—all of the \\"Four A's\\" were duly elected. This prompted the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1940, which replaced that ballot paper layout with one closer to the present layout where the order of candidates' names within each group was determined by those candidates' mutual consent, which in practice means it is determined by the party organization. > \\"These days, the order of candidates on the voting form is determined by a > draw from a hat. Back then, the Electoral Commission [scil. Electoral > Office, pre-1984] simply followed the alphabet. This led to many interesting > battles of tactics between the Comms (Communist Party of Australia) and > their arch-rivals the DLP (Democratic Labor Party), who were also keen to > get their people at the head of the ticket.

The Chifley Government introduced proportional representation for the Senate in 1948. Candidates were listed alphabetically in party order and the position of the parties candidates on the ballot paper was determined by lot after the close of nominations. In large states such as New South Wales and Victoria, there were at times over 100 candidates on the ballot paper, with voters required to list each candidate in order of preference. Consequently, there was a high percentage of informal votes and donkey votes cast in Senate elections. As a result, electoral reforms were introduced in 1983 allowing voters an alternative of voting 1 above the line for the party of their choice, with preferences being distributed according to a ticket lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission prior to the commencement of voting. This reform has greatly reduced the incidence of donkey voting and informal voting in Australian Senate elections. However, this system has led to a great increase of horse trading by parties in the development of the distribution of preferences as it makes the difference in deciding who fills the final few positions in the Senate representing that State. For example, the election of Steve Fielding of the Family First Party in the Victorian Senate election in 2004 with a party vote of 1.88% resulted from horse-trading associated with this process. States that use proportional representation to elect their upper houses such as New South Wales use a similar system to the Senate. =Hare–Clark elections= Two Australian jurisdictions use the Hare–Clark proportional representation system: the Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly (the latter being a unicameral system). Tasmania has used Hare–Clark since 1907, and the Australian Capital Territory since 1995. In Tasmania, candidates used to be listed in alphabetical order within a party column, leading to a donkey vote effect. For their ballots to be valid, voters only need to number as many candidates as there are vacancies to be filled, although they are free to number all the candidates if they wish. However, it was observed that often a candidate whose name appeared below the name of a popular candidate (such as a State party leader) would be elected on the leader's second preferences. As popular leaders such as Robin Gray, Kate Carnell or Jon Stanhope have achieved several quotas of first-preference votes in their own right at the height of their popularity, the impact of this position can lead to candidates being elected on the leaders' \\"coat-tails\\". A similar phenomenon has been observed in Ireland and Malta, which also use STV (with candidates ranked alphabetically). In 1979, Neil Robson, a Liberal member for Bass in the Tasmanian parliament, introduced the system known as Robson Rotation. Under this system, each ballot paper contains a different permutation of candidates so each candidate has a certain percentage of instances at every position in their party's column, therefore equally dispersing the donkey votes and nullifying their impact on the result as to which of a party's candidates is favoured, but allowing the party as a whole to be properly benefited. Manifestation in other electoral systems Donkey votes have been observed in democracies other than Australia, even those without compulsory preferential voting, although the presence of these two factors in Australia makes the phenomenon more visible. In systems where voting is not compulsory, it seems counter-intuitive that many who attend the polls would be apathetic. However, there may be countervailing factors that produce a \\"donkey vote\\" even with voluntary turnout. In many US elections, a voter may well be intensely interested in (e.g.) the Presidential contest but not in other, less prominent races on the same \\"long ballot\\". Since most non-preferential elections require the voter to mark only one single candidate, or one single party list, it becomes impossible to speculate how many votes for the first candidate or party on the ballot are genuine supporters and how many are donkey votes. In some elections (e.g. Germany and some US states), the order of parties on the ballot is in descending order of their support at the previous election (with new parties being placed lowest in random order). Such a system makes high ballot position both a cause and an effect of high electoral support. =United States= Donkey voting shows up in US state elections that use the \\"long ballot\\" for numerous offices, or in multi-seat elections where there are several candidates from the same party. In his book The Rise of Guardian Democracy: The Supreme Court's Role in Voting Rights, 1845-1969 (Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 1974), Ward E.Y. Elliott notes: > \\"One long-time Democrat precinct captain in Denver noted that, besides > having party or lobby support, a candidate had to rank high in the ballot > list. Since ballot ranking was alphabetical, most of the eight Denver > [district State] Senators had names beginning with A, B or C.\\" (p 362, > citing appellants’ brief in Lucas v Colorado). In 2018 North Carolina Supreme Court election, a rule change resulted in the order of the names on the ballot differing from previous years. The Charlotte Observer claimed that \\"Studies have shown ballot order favors the candidate listed first, and could make a difference in a close race\\", even though the State has first-past-the-post voting with voluntary turnout. =United Kingdom= British pro-STV campaigner Enid Lakeman noted the same effect in UK local elections, where significant numbers of voters invited to X (say) three candidates for three council seats would simply mark an X against the three highest on the ballot-paper, even if they belonged to different parties. =Ireland= In Ireland, where voting is preferential but not compulsory, the donkey vote has its greatest effect not between parties but within them. With an alphabetical list of candidates, and several candidates from each major party for the three to five seats per district, the proportion of Dáil Éireann deputies with surnames A to M is typically much higher than 50%, whereas it is only about half the population (according to the Irish telephone directory).B Walsh and C Robson, Alphabetical Voting: A Study of the 1973 General Election in the Republic of Ireland, Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), General Research Series No #71, Dublin, January 1973 In O’Reilly v Minister for Environment,O’Reilly v Minister for Environment [1986] IR 143 the Irish High Court upheld the constitutional validity of alphabetical listing against an equality-rights challenge, noting that despite its faults, A to Z does have the advantage of making it easy to find candidates on the ballot-paper.

The painting was done by women at three different United States Radium factories, and the term now applies to the women working at the facilities: one in Orange, New Jersey, beginning around 1917; one in Ottawa, Illinois, beginning in the early 1920s; and a third facility in Waterbury, Connecticut. The women in each facility had been told the paint was harmless, and subsequently ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to \\"point\\" their brushes on their lips in order to give them a fine tip; some also painted their fingernails, face and teeth with the glowing substance. The women were instructed to point their brushes in this way, because using rags or a water rinse caused them to use more time and material, which was made from powdered radium, gum arabic and water. Five of the women in New Jersey challenged their employer in a case over the right of individual workers who contract occupational diseases to sue their employers under New Jersey's occupational injuries law, which at the time had a two-year statute of limitations, but settled out of court in 1928. Five women in Illinois who were employees of the Radium Dial Company (which was unaffiliated with the United States Radium Corporation) sued their employer under Illinois law, winning damages in 1938. United States Radium Corporation 1921 advertisement for Undark From 1917 to 1926, U.S. Radium Corporation, originally called the Radium Luminous Material Corporation, was engaged in the extraction and purification of radium from carnotite ore to produce luminous paints, which were marketed under the brand name \\"Undark\\". The ore was mined from the Paradox Valley in Colorado and other \\"Undark mines\\" in Utah. As a defense contractor, U.S. Radium was a major supplier of radioluminescent watches to the military. Their plant in Orange, New Jersey, employed over one hundred workers, mainly women, to paint radium-lit watch faces and instruments, misleading them that it was safe. =Radiation exposure= U.S. Radium Corporation hired approximately 70 women to perform various tasks including handling radium, while the owners and the scientists familiar with the effects of radium carefully avoided any exposure to it themselves; chemists at the plant used lead screens, masks and tongs.http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=660 U.S. Radium had distributed literature to the medical community describing the \\"injurious effects\\" of radium. In spite of this knowledge, a number of similar deaths had occurred by 1925, including the company's chief chemist, Dr. Edwin E. Leman, and several female workers. The similar circumstances of their deaths prompted investigations to be undertaken by Dr. Harrison Martland, County Physician of Newark. An estimated 4,000 workers were hired by corporations in the U.S. and Canada to paint watch faces with radium. At USRC, each of the painters mixed her own paint in a small crucible, and then used camel hair brushes to apply the glowing paint onto dials. The then-current rate of pay, for painting 250 dials a day, was about a penny and a half per dial (). The brushes would lose shape after a few strokes, so the U.S. Radium supervisors encouraged their workers to point the brushes with their lips (\\"lip, dip, paint\\"), or use their tongues to keep them sharp. Because the true nature of the radium had been kept from them, the Radium Girls painted their nails, teeth, and faces for fun with the deadly paint produced at the factory. Many of the workers became sick; it is unknown how many died from exposure to radiation. =Radiation sickness= Many of the women later began to suffer from anemia, bone fractures, and necrosis of the jaw, a condition now known as radium jaw. It is thought that the X-ray machines used by the medical investigators may have contributed to some of the sickened workers' ill-health by subjecting them to additional radiation. It turned out at least one of the examinations was a ruse, part of a campaign of disinformation started by the defense contractor. U.S. Radium and other watch-dial companies rejected claims that the afflicted workers were suffering from exposure to radium. For some time, doctors, dentists, and researchers complied with requests from the companies not to release their data. At the urging of the companies, worker deaths were attributed by medical professionals to other causes. Syphilis, a notorious sexually transmitted infection at the time, was often cited in attempts to smear the reputations of the women. The inventor of radium dial paint, Dr Sabin A. Von Sochocky, died in November 1928, becoming the 16th known victim of poisoning by radium dial paint. He had gotten sick from radium in his hands, not the jaw, but the circumstances of his death helped the Radium Girls in court. Radium Dial Company The Radium Dial Company was established in Ottawa, Illinois, in 1922, in the town's former high school. Like the United States Radium Corporation, the purpose of the studio in Ottawa was to paint dials for clocks, their largest client being Westclox Corporation in Peru, Illinois. Dials painted in Ottawa appeared on Westclox's popular Big Ben, Little Ben and travel clocks; and like United States Radium Corporation, Radium Dial hired young women to paint the dials, using the same \\"lip, dip, paint\\" approach as the women in New Jersey and by another unaffiliated plant in Waterbury, Connecticut, that supplied the Waterbury Clock Company. Following the termination of President Joseph Kelly from the concern, Kelly established a competing firm in the town named Luminous Process Company, which also employed women in the same fashion, and in the conditions as the other firms. Employees at Radium Dial began showing signs of radium poisoning in 1926–1927 and were unaware of the hearings and trials in New Jersey. Furthermore, Radium Dial leadership authorized physicals and other tests designed to determine the toxicity of radium paint to its employees, but the company never gave those records to the employees or told them of the results. In a half-hearted attempt to end the use of the camel hair brushes, management introduced glass pens with a fine point; however, the workers found that the pens slowed their productivity (they were paid by the piece), and they reverted to using brushes. When word of the New Jersey women and their suits appeared in local newspapers, the women were told that the radium was safe and that employees in New Jersey were showing signs of viral infections. Assured by their employers that the radium was safe, they returned to work as usual. SignificanceLitigation= In New Jersey, the story of the abuse perpetrated against the workers is distinguished from most such cases by the fact that the ensuing litigation was covered widely by the media. Plant worker Grace Fryer decided to sue, but it took two years for her to find a lawyer willing to take on U.S. Radium. Even after the women found a lawyer, the litigation process moved slowly. At their first appearance in court on January 1928, two women were bedridden and none of them could raise their arms to take an oath. A total of five factory workers – Grace Fryer, Edna Hussman, Katherine Schaub, and sisters Quinta McDonald and Albina Larice – dubbed the Radium Girls, joined the suit. The litigation and media sensation surrounding the case established legal precedents and triggered the enactment of regulations governing labor safety standards, including a baseline of \\"provable suffering\\". In Illinois, employees began asking for compensation for their medical and dental bills as early as 1927 but were refused by management. The demand for money by sick and dying former employees continued into the mid 1930s before a suit before the Illinois Industrial Commission (IIC) was brought. In 1937 five women found an attorney by the name of Leonard Grossman, that would represent them in front of the commission, but by this time, Radium Dial had closed, moving to New York. The IIC did retain a $10,000 deposit left by Radium Dial when it disclosed to the IIC that they could not find any insurance to cover the cost of indemnifying the company against employee suits. In the spring of 1938, the IIC ruled in favor of the women. The attorney representing the interests of Radium Dial appealed hoping to get the verdict overturned, and again the commission judge found for the women. Radium Dial appealed over and over, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court and on October 23, 1939, the court decided not to hear the appeal and the lower ruling was upheld. In the end, this case had been won eight times before the Radium Dial was finally forced to pay. =Historical impact= The Radium Girls' saga holds an important place in the history of both the field of health physics and the labor rights movement. The right of individual workers to sue for damages from corporations due to labor abuse was established as a result of the Radium Girls case. In the wake of the case, industrial safety standards were demonstrably enhanced for many decades. The case was settled in the autumn of 1928, before the trial was deliberated by the jury, and the settlement for each of the Radium Girls was $10,000 () and a $600 per year annuity () plus $12 a week () for all of their lives while they lived, and all medical and legal expenses incurred would also be paid by the company.http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl The lawsuit and resulting publicity was a factor in the establishment of occupational disease labor law. Radium dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear; in particular, they no longer shaped paint brushes by lip and avoided ingesting or breathing the paint. Radium paint was still used in dials as late as the 1960s. Former factory site in West Orange, N.J. =Scientific impact= Robley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At MIT he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the National Bureau of Standards to establish the tolerance level for radium of 0.1 μCi (3.7 kBq). The Center for Human Radiobiology was established at Argonne National Laboratory in 1968. The primary purpose of the Center was providing medical examinations for living dial painters. The project also focused on the collection of information and, in some cases, tissue samples from the radium dial painters. When the project ended in 1993, detailed information of 2,403 cases had been collected. This led to a book on the effects of radium on humans. The book suggests that radium-228 exposure is more harmful to health than exposure to radium-226. Radium-228 is more able to cause cancer of the bone as the shorter half life of the radon-220 product compared to radon-222 causes the daughter nuclides of radium-228 to deliver a greater dose of alpha radiation to the bones. It also considers the induction of a range of different forms of cancer as a result of internal exposure to radium and its daughter nuclides. The book used data from radium dial painters, people who were exposed as a result of the use of radium-containing medical products, and other groups of people who have been exposed to radium. = In literature, music and film = *New Jersey punk band Night Birds has a song titled \\"Radium Girls\\" on their 2018 album Roll Credits. *The story is told from the point of view of the women in New Jersey, and Illinois, in Kate Moore's non-fiction book The Radium Girls ) released in the UK in 2016 and US in 2017. *The story is told in Eleanor Swanson's poem \\"Radium Girls\\", collected in A Thousand Bonds: Marie Curie and the Discovery of Radium (2003, ). *There is an elaborate reference to the story in the Kurt Vonnegut novel Jailbird (1979, ). *Poet Lavinia Greenlaw has written on the subject in The Innocence of Radium (Night Photograph, 1994). *Historian Claudia Clark wrote an account of the case and its wider historical implications: Radium Girls: Women and Industrial Health Reform, 1910–1935 (published 1997). *Ross Mullner's book Deadly Glow: The Radium Dial Worker Tragedy describes many of the events (1999, ). *The story is told by Jo Lawrence in her short animated film \\"Glow\\" (2007). *The Michael A.

He was born in Oropesa, Spain, about 1495 and most sources claim he died on Puná Island, now part of Ecuador, in 1541, at the hands of the indigenous peoples. Biography He was born in Oropesa, near Toledo, at the end of the 15th century.Leon, P., 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, Salamanca Al Dia: \\"El padre Vicente Valverde, pionero de la evangelización del Perú\\" by José Antonio Benito 26 de noviembre de 2014 He was the son of Francisco de Valverde and Ana Alvarez de Toledo, and was related to many noble families of the region, in particular to that of Francisco Pizarro, the conquistador of Peru, and that of Hernán Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico. In 1515 he was sent to study at the University of Salamanca. While a student there, he later asked to be received into the Dominican Order, which he was in 1523 at the Priory of San Esteban at Salamanca. He became a professed friar of the Order in April 1524, and was ordained a priest within the next few years. Valverde accompanied Pizarro as a missionary on his intended voyage of the conquest of Peru according to the 1529 agreement. He arrived in Peru about 1530, although it is not certain whether he traveled directly there with Pizarro from Spain in 1529 or arrived at San Miguel de Piura in 1531 with re-enforcements from Panama, the initial staging base for the Spanish forces. Before the Battle of Caxamarca on 16 November 1532, Valverde endeavoured to obtain the Great Inca Atahuallpa's peaceful submission. When Atahuallpa rejected a pact of friendship with Pizarro, Friar Vicente joined in the conversation: “He came forward holding a crucifix in his right hand and a breviary in his left and introduced himself as another envoy of the Spanish ruler. ...Friar Vicente called upon the Inca to renounce all other gods as being a mockery of the truth.” Atahuallpa simply replied that he could not change his beliefs in the all powerful and ever living Sun and other divinities. Following the death of Atahuallpa, Pizarro saw no further obstacles to his conquest and decided to march into Cuzco on 15 November 1533, bringing Valverde along with him and his followers. On 23 March 1534, a church was erected in Cuzco and became Valverde's parish church. Pizarro also gave him a large native commandery, whom Valverde allegedly mistreated by simply using them as slaves. Valverde headed back to Spain later that year to assist Pizarro's brother, Hernando Pizarro, in his negotiations at court. There he presented to the emperor, by order of Pizarro, an account of the conquest, under the title of Relacion de la Conquista de los Reynos de Peru, in which he claimed that the Native Americans could scarcely be considered as human beings, as they had no souls. He was nominated bishop of Cuzco in 1535. In 1536 Valverde was named Protector of the Natives and Inquisitor. That same year, the Holy See established Cuzco, the royal city of the Incan kings, as the seat of the first diocese of the Catholic Church in South America, covering the entire continent, up to modern Nicaragua. Emperor Charles V named Valverde as the first Bishop of Cuzco; Pope Paul III ratified this choice in a consistory held in January 1537. After being consecrated as a bishop, Valverde returned to Peru in the beginning of 1538, just before the execution of Diego de Almagro, which he had unsuccessfully tried to prevent. The new bishop found the spiritual duties for his vast diocese arduous, especially combined with those of the office of Protector of the Natives. This forced him to ignore the members of the military constantly, as the adventurers who made up the Spanish armies had no thought of justice or mercy to the Indians. In 1539 Valverde had work begun for the first cathedral of the diocese, now the Church of the Triumph, built on the site of a temple attached to the palace of Viracocha Inca, the last native ruler of the region. On 11 March 1540 he officiated at its consecration. After the assassination of Francisco Pizarro by forces of Diego de Almagro II in June 1541, Valverde fled to Panama, where his brother had been appointed as governor by Pizarro. He halted for a brief stay on Puná Island, near Guayaquil, in Ecuador, where he was captured and put to death by the local indigenous people on 31 October 1541. Criticisms By far Valverde's negative and contradictory side was his alleged mistreatment of the natives of Peru whom, instead of teaching the Catholic faith, he oppressed, enslaved and forced to work for the Church. These charges came about when Valverde was later appointed by Pizarro on a commission to apportion lands and natives to the royal officers, along with the lawyer, Antonio de Game, whom Pizarro had appointed Supreme Judge of Cuzco. The latter charged Valverde in a letter to the emperor, dated 10 March 1539, with arbitrary acts and insisted that instead of protecting the natives, he only mistreated them and sought to confiscate their lands, and always gave the greater part to himself and his assistant. (This was the complete opposite to what Bartolomé de Las Casas, another Spanish Dominican friar and bishop, did years later by defending the natives' rights in works he published and in visits to Spain to inform King Philip II of the abuses committed against the local natives by the Conquistadors.) The validity of these charges is in dispute, however, as they are not universally mentioned by chroniclers of the period, and the main accusers might have had political reasons for these charges, as opponents of the Pizarro regime.

He wrote five novels and numerous philosophical works. He also lectured at universities in France, Belgium, the United States, and Japan.  Life and work  Biography = Michel Henry was born in Haiphong, French Indochina (now Vietnam), and he lived in French Indochina until he was seven years old. Following the death of his father, who was an officer in the French Navy, he and his mother settled in metropolitan France. While studying in Paris, he discovered a true passion for philosophy, which he decided to make his profession—he enrolled at the École Normale Supérieure, at the time part of the University of Paris.\\"Biographie\\" at the official site of Michel Henry. From June 1943 he was fully engaged with the French Resistance, joining the maquis of the Haut Jura under the code name of Kant. He often had to come down from the mountains in order to accomplish missions in Nazi- occupied Lyon, an experience of clandestinity that deeply marked his philosophy.Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, Michel Henry, éd. l'Age d'Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 12–15) At the end of the war he took the final part of the philosophy examination at the university, following which he wrote in 1963Eventually published in 1973. a doctoral thesis from the University of Paris, titled L'essence de la manifestation (The Essence of Manifestation), under the direction of Jean Hyppolite, Jean Wahl, Paul Ricœur, Ferdinand Alquié, and Henri Gouhier.Alan D. Schrift (2006), Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers, Blackwell Publishing, pp. 136–137. His first book, on the Philosophy and Phenomenology of the Body, was completed in 1950. His first significant published work was on The Essence of Manifestation, to which he devoted long years of necessary research in order to surmount the main deficiency of all intellectualist philosophy, the ignorance of life as experienced.Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, Michel Henry, éd. l'Age d'Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 21–26) From 1960, Michel Henry was a professor of philosophy at the University of Montpellier, where he patiently perfected his work, keeping himself away from philosophical fashions and far from dominant ideologies.Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, Michel Henry, éd. l’Age d’Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 27–50)Paul Audi, Michel Henry, Les belles lettres, 2006, p. 22 : « Michel Henry fait partie de ces très rares philosophes qui, dans la seconde moitié du siècle dernier, se sont frayé leurs voies propres à l'écart des modes contemporaines. » He died in Albi, France, at the age of eighty. The sole subject of his philosophy is living subjectivity, which is to say the real life of living individuals. This subject is found in all his work and ensures its deep unity in spite of the diversity of themes he tackled.Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, Michel Henry, éd. l’Age d’Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 5–6) It has been suggested that he proposed the most profound theory of subjectivity in the Twentieth Century. = A phenomenology of life = The work of Michel Henry is based on Phenomenology, which is the study of the phenomenon. The English/German/Latinate word \\"phenomenon\\" comes from the Greek \\"phainomenon\\" which means \\"that which shows itself by coming into the light\\".I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity (§ 1, p. 14) The everyday understanding of phenomenon as appearance is only possible as a negative derivation of this authentic sense of Greek self-showing. The object of phenomenology is not however something that appears, such as a particular thing or phenomena, but the act of appearing itself.Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair (§ 1, p. 35) Henry's thought led him to a reversal of Husserlian phenomenology, which acknowledges as phenomenon only that which appears in the world, or exteriority. Henry counterposed this conception of phenomenality with a radical phenomenology of life.Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair (§ 1–15, pp. 35–132) Henry defines life from a phenomenological point of view as what possesses the faculty and the power \\"to feel and to experience oneself in each point of its being\\".See for example La barbarie (§ 1, p. 15) For Henry, life is essentially force and affect; it is essentially invisible; it consists in a pure experience of itself which perpetually oscillates between suffering and joy; it is an always begun again passage from suffering to joy.See for example The Essence of Manifestation (§ 52–70) Thought is for him only a mode of life, because it is not thought which gives access to life, but life that allows thought to reach itself.Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair (§ 15, p. 129) According to Henry, life can never be seen from the exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and experiences itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them.I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity (§ 3, pp. 33–47) In the same way, it is impossible to see another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it at the end of a scalpel. Henry's philosophy goes on to aver that we undergo life in a radical passivity, we are reduced to bear it permanently as what we have not wanted, and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation and the cause of suffering.The Essence of Manifestation (§ 53)La barbarie (§ 4, pp. 126–128) No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time, the simple fact of living, of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of not existing is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life, they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its \\"pathetic\\" self-revelation (from the French word pathétique which means capable of feeling something like suffering or joy).The Essence of Manifestation (§ 70) For Henry, life is not a universal, blind, impersonal and abstract substance, it is necessarily the personal and concrete life of a living individual, it carries in it a consubstantial Ipseity which refers to the fact of being itself, to the fact of being a Self.Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair (Introduction, p. 29) This life is the personal and finite life of men, or the personal and infinite life of God. = Two modes of manifestation = Two modes of manifestation of phenomena exist, according to Henry, which are two ways of appearing: \\"exteriority\\", which is the mode of manifestation of the visible world, and phenomenological \\"interiority\\", which is the mode of manifestation of invisible life.See for example the conclusion of L'Essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 70, p. 860) Our bodies, for instance, are in life given to us from the inside, which allows us, for example, to move our hands, and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object that we can see in the world.Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988 (pp. 14–18) The \\"invisible\\", here, does not correspond to that which is too small to be seen with the naked eye, or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive, but rather to life, which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world. No-one has ever seen a force, a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, p. 27) Some of his assertions seem paradoxical and difficult to understand at first glance, not only because they are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (p. 16, pp. 218–222 and p. 301) = Critique of Western philosophy = Western philosophy as a whole since its Greek origins recognizes only the visible world and exteriority as the sole form of manifestation. It is trapped into what in The Essence of Manifestation Michel Henry calls \\"ontological monism\\"; it completely ignores the invisible interiority of life, its radical immanence and its original mode of revelation which is irreducible to any form of transcendence or to any exteriority.See Michel Henry, L'essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 11, p. 91) When subjectivity or life are in question, they are never grasped in their purity; they are systematically reduced to biological life, to their external relation with the world, or as in Husserl to an intentionality, i.e. an orientation of consciousness towards an object outside it.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 3, pp. 46–70) Henry rejects materialism, which admits only matter as reality, because the manifestation of matter in the transcendence of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to be able to see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.See Michel Henry, L'essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 70, p. 858) The deep originality of Michel Henry's thought and its radical novelty in relation to all preceding philosophy explains its fairly limited reception. It is however a philosophy that is admired for its \\"rigor\\" and its \\"depth\\".See for example the article from Xavier Tillette in Manifestation et révélation, éd. Beauchesne, 1976, pp. 207–236 : « Accueilli dès sa parution comme un grand livre, admiré de ses juges, l'ouvrage de Michel Henry, L'Essence de la Manifestation reste, dix ans après, le chef-d’œuvre inconnu. On ne s'explique que trop bien, hélas, cette désaffection. Sa rigueur et son abstraction, comme un rempart protecteur, écartent le lecteur insuffisamment armé, décourageant le simple curieux ou l'amateur pressé. En outre il est indifférent au succès et aux modes, il ne se rattache à aucune école patentée, il n'appartient à aucun mouvement en vogue. » (p. 207) and « Si toutefois l'impression de solitude persiste et le tourmente, surtout la solitude qui provient de l'indifférence environnante, puisse-t-il se consoler avec sa fière maxime retournée : \\"Plus une pensée est profonde et rétablit l'ordre vrai des choses, plus étroite l'audience dont elle est assurée\\" ! » (p. 236).Pierre Gire, review Esprit et Vie n°138, 2005, article entitled \\"L'excès de la vie sur sa représentation scientifique : la perspective philosophique de Michel Henry. Pour une philosophie du sujet vivant\\" : \\"[Michel Henry] est mort le 3 juillet 2002 à Albi, laissant une œuvre d'une grande profondeur intellectuelle, très originale, d'un accès difficile, mais dont l'influence sur les générations suivantes n'est pas près de se tarir.\\"Paul Audi, Michel Henry, Les belles lettres (2006) : \\"Comprendre le \\"Moi\\" et les phénomènes du monde à partir du \\"vivre\\" et de son auto-affection, tel est le vrai ressort de cette œuvre dense et rigoureuse.\\" (cover page)Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska, Michel Henry. Passion et magnificence de la vie, Beauchesne (2003) : \\"L'élucidation de ces différentes régions phénoménologiques n'a d'autre but, en effet, que l'approfondissement de la sphère originaire et invisible de la Vie qui les détermine toutes, déterminant aussi la téléologie générale d'une pensée qui se distingue, parmi toutes les philosophies de la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, par sa radicalité et par la profondeur de sa visée métaphysique.\\" (p. 2) But his thought is both \\"difficult\\" and \\"demanding\\", despite the simplicity and immediacy of its central and unique theme of phenomenological life, the experience of which it tries to communicate.Michel Henry, Auto- donation. Entretiens et conférences, éd. Beauchesne, 2004, article de Magali Uhl et Jean-Marie Brohm, pp. 269–281 : « Conscients de la chance qui nous était offerte d’être en proximité avec cette pensée exigeante qui refusait toute concession aux modes, aux coteries, aux crédulités obligatoires, nous avons surtout mesuré à quel point Michel Henry possédait ce souffle spirituel qui est la grâce du don. Parce qu’à chacun d’entre nous, il a apporté quelque chose d’inestimable : la liberté de l’esprit, l’émerveillement continu devant les plus hautes valeurs de la culture, le refus du nihilisme. » (p. 269) and « La pensée de Michel Henry, exigeante, radicalement libre, tout entière irradiée par sa passion de la vie, est de celles qui permettent de comprendre la barbarie en ses fondements et de la combattre. » (p. 281) It is the immediacy and absolute transparency of life which explains the difficulty of grasping it as a thought: it is much easier to speak of what we see than of this invisible life, which fundamentally avoids being seen from the outside.Michel Henry, L’Essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 53, p. 590)Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, 1965, p. 306 = Reception of Henry's philosophy = His thesis on The Essence of Manifestation was warmly welcomed by the members of the jury, who recognized the intellectual value and the seriousness of its author, although this thesis did not have any influence on their later works.Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 361) His book on Marx was rejected by Marxists, who were harshly criticized, as well as by those who refused to see in Marx a philosopher and who reduced him to an ideologue responsible from Marxism.Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, pp. 361–362) His book on Barbarism was considered by some as a rather simplistic and overly trenchant anti-scientific discourse. Nevertheless, it seems that science and technology too often pursue their blind and unrestrained development in defiance of life.Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 362) His works on Christianity seem rather to have disappointed certain professional theologians and Catholic exegetes, who contented themselves with picking out and correcting what they considered as \\"dogmatic errors\\".Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, pp. 362–363) His phenomenology of life was the subject of a pamphlet on Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française (The Theological Turn in French Phenomenology) by Dominique Janicaud, who sees in the immanence of life only the affirmation of a tautological interiority.Dominique Janicaud, Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française, Editions de l’éclat, 1991, pp. 57–70. On the other hand, Antoine Vidalin published a book entitled La parole de la Vie (The Word of Life) in which he shows that Michel Henry's phenomenology allows for a renewed approach to every area of theology.Antoine Vidalin, La Parole de la Vie, éd. Parole et silence, 2006 (pp. 11–12) As Alain David says in an article published in the French journal Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger (number 3, July – September 2001),Article available online at http://www.cairn.info/revue-philosophique-2001-3-page-359.htm the thought of Michel Henry seems so radical, it affects our habitual ways of thinking so deeply, that it has had a difficult reception, even if all his readers declare themselves impressed by its \\"power\\", by the \\"staggering effect\\" of a thought which \\"sweeps everything clean on its way through\\", which \\"prompts admiration\\", but nevertheless \\"doesn’t really convince\\", as we don't know whether we are confronted by \\"the violence of a prophetic voice or by pure madness\\".Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 363) In the same journal, Rolf Kühn also asserts, in order to explain the difficult reception of Michel Henry's work, that \\"if we do not side with any power in this world, we inevitably submit to silence and to criticism from every possible power, because we remind each institution that its visible or apparent power is, in fact, only powerlessness, because nobody gives himself over to absolute phenomenological life\\".Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 303) His books have been translated into many languages, notably English, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. A substantial amount of work has been dedicated to him, mainly in French, but also in German, Spanish and Italian. A number of international seminars have also been dedicated to the thought of Michel Henry in Beirut, Cerisy, Namur, Prague, Montpellier, Paris and Louvain-la-Neuve in 2010. Michel Henry is considered by the specialists who know his work and recognize its value as one of the most important contemporary philosophers,Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska : Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie (cover)Jad Hatem : Michel Henry, la parole de Vie (p. 13)Collectif (Colloque international de Montpellier 2003) : Michel Henry. Pensée de la vie et culture contemporaine (p. 10) and his phenomenology of life has started to gain a following. A Michel Henry Study Center has been established at St Joseph's University in Beirut (Lebanon) under the direction of Professor Jad Hatem. Since 2006, the archives of the philosopher have been deposited by his wife at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), where they form the Michel Henry archives Fund, placed under the direction of Jean Leclercq. An annual review, called Revue internationale Michel Henry, is also edited by this Fund in collaboration with the Presses universitaires de Louvain since 2010. A newsletter on Michel Henry in French, called La gazette d'Aliahova (in reference to the town of Aliahova described in the Michel Henry novel L'Amour les yeux fermés), is published every month by Roland Vaschalde since 2010. The goal of this publication is to keep informed of the articles, books, courses, seminars and meetings on the thought of Michel Henry.  Consequences of Henry's philosophy  On the Body and Subjectivity = Philosophy and phenomenology of the body (1965)  The different philosophical systems all agreed, despite the diversity of their theories concerning the body, on the decisive doctrine of the belonging of the body to the being of the world. The first and the unique philosopher who understood the necessity of determining originally or fundamentally our body as a 'subjective body' is Maine de Biran, who Michel Henry calls a 'prince of thought', and who deserves according to him to be considered as well as Descartes and Husserl as one of the true founders of a phenomenological science of human reality.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975, Antoine Vidalin, La Parole de la Vie, éd. Parole et silence, 2006, According to Maine de Biran, the being or the reality of the ego does not reside in the immobility of substance-thought, as in the cogito of Descartes, but in the inner experience of a personal and purely subjective effort in its accomplishment. This is with this personal and purely subjective effort that begins and ends, according to Maine de Biran, the very being of the ego or its inner reality. The being or the true reality of the ego is no longer reduced to a pure thought whose nature is limited to the external knowledge of extension and to the contemplation of the external world. According to Maine de Biran, the ego is first a power that manifests itself in the subjective effort he accomplishes at each time, so that the cogito does not have for him the signification of being an 'I think' but on the opposite of being an 'I can'.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975, Antoine Vidalin, La Parole de la Vie, éd. Parole et silence, 2006, The depth of the philosophy of Maine de Biran resides according to Michel Henry in the affirmation that the true being of the movement, but also of the action and of the power of the ego is accurately that of a cogito or of a subjectivity. According to Michel Henry, the philosophical and ontological consequences of this thesis are infinite. By affirming like this the belonging of the true being of movement to what Michel Henry calls the \\"sphere of the absolute immanence of subjectivity\\", Maine de Biran proposes in reality \\"an entirely new theory\\" of the way whose knowledge of movement is given to us. This knowledge of movement is that of the personal and immanent experience that everyone does of its own subjective body and of its own life. Consequently, movement is known to us in both an inner and immediate way, which consequently concerns an absolute certainty.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975, Michel Henry is finally led at the end of his reflexion to distinguish three different bodies: 1) The original being of the subjective body, which is the absolute body of subjectivity as revealed in the internal experience of the movement, and which possesses the immediate power to move its organs and knows this power with an inner and immanent knowledge; this subjective body is a fundamental 'I can' and its being is a pure revelation of itself. 2) The organic body, which is the immediate and moving terminus of the subjective body, or rather the ensemble of the termini over which movement has a hold; it is the transcendent medium that gives up to the effort of our movement ; it is divided into various transcendent masses whose unity is provided by the subjective body. 3) The transcendent or objective body, which manifests in the external world, where it appears with the signification of being mine; the objective body can be the theme of scientific research ; this is the only body known by the philosophical tradition.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975, Antoine Vidalin, La Parole de la Vie, éd. Parole et silence, 2006, According to Michel Henry, the world consists in the totality of the contents of all experiences that can live or feel our subjective body, it is in reality the terminus or the limit of all our real, possible and imaginable movements that we can accomplish. The power of acting, that Michel Henry also calls the habit, is finally the real and concrete possibility of a world being given to us, it is a \\"possibility of knowledge in general\\". The world is the terminus or the outcome of all our subjective power and of all our habits, and it is for this reason that we are truly its inhabitants. The body is however not an instantaneous knowledge, it is on the contrary a permanent knowledge which coincides with our own existence, so that we can say that the subjective body as a whole is memory.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975, As underlined by Michel Henry, \\"habit is the foundation for memory\\" , which significates that the original being of the subjective body is a \\"possibility of knowledge in general\\", that's to say a knowledge or a memory of the world in its absence, and consequently an immanent memory of its forms.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, coll. « Epiméthée », 1965, Michel Henry, Philosophy and phenomenology of the body, Nijhoff, 1975,  Genealogy of psychoanalysis (1985)  Michel Henry undertook a study of the historical and philosophical genesis of psychoanalysis in the light of phenomenology of life in Généalogie de la psychanalyse, le commencement perdu (Genealogy of Psychoanalysis, the Lost Beginning), in which he shows that the Freudian notion of the unconscious results from the inability of Freud, its founder, to think the essence of life in its purity as affectivity and auto-affection.Michel Henry, Généalogie de la psychanalyse, PUF, 1985 (pp. 5–15 et 386) The repressed representation does not come from the unconscious, it is simply unformed:Michel Henry, Généalogie de la psychanalyse, PUF, 1985 (p. 234) the unconscious is only an empty representation, it does not exist—or rather, the real unconscious is life itself in its pathetic reality.Michel Henry, Généalogie de la psychanalyse, PUF, 1985 (pp. 348 et 384) And it is not repression that provokes anguish, whose existence depends on the mere fact of power, but unused psychic energy or libido.Michel Henry, Généalogie de la psychanalyse, PUF, 1985 (p. 380) As for the notion of consciousness, it simply means the power of seeing, it is nothing but a consciousness of the object which leads to an empty subjectivity.Michel Henry, Généalogie de la psychanalyse, PUF, 1985 (pp. 125–158)  The Book of the Dead (not published)  Henry's planned last book was entitled Le Livre des Morts (The Book of the Dead) and would have dealt with what he called \\"clandestine subjectivity\\": a theme which evokes the condition of life in the modern world and which also alludes to his commitment to the Resistance and his personal experience of clandestinity.See the 'Biographie' page of the official site of Michel Henry and Auto-donation. Entretiens et conférences, p. 250 = On Economy and Politics = Marx (1976)  Michel Henry wrote an important work on Karl Marx, whom he considers, paradoxically, as one of the leading Christian thinkers and one of the most important western philosophers,Michel Henry, Marx II. Une philosophie de l'économie, éd. Gallimard, 1976, p. 445Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 25 due to the weight he gives in his thought to living work and to the living individual (praxis) in which he sees the foundation of economic reality.Michel Henry, Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité, éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 193 et 207 par exemple One reason why Marx's genuine thought has been so misunderstood is the complete ignorance of his fundamental philosophical writings during the development of the official doctrine of Marxism, due to their very late publication — for example, The German Ideology only appeared in 1932.Michel Henry, Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité, éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 9–33 But the real reason for ignorance of Marx's philosophical texts is Marxism's negation, from its earliest days, of subjectivity, because Marxism is nothing other than a repetition of Hegelianism, which is a philosophy of objectivity which reduces the individual to the effective becoming of the Absolute and its manifestation in the light of ek-static exteriority.Michel Henry, Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité, éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 333–337 This work on Marx was published in two volumes entitled respectively Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité and Marx II. Une philosophie de l’économie, translated in English as Marx: A Philosophy of Human Reality.  From Communism to Capitalism (1990)  Communism and Capitalism are for Michel Henry two faces of the one death, which consists in the negation of life.Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 176 Communism eliminates individual life in favour of universal abstractions like society, people, history or social classes.Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 52 Marxism is according to Michel Henry a form of fascism, i.e. a doctrine which originates in the degradation of the individual whose elimination is considered as legitimate,Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 87 whereas capitalism substitutes economic entities such as money, profit or interest for the real needs of life.Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, pp. 142 et 148 Capitalism however recognizes life as a source of value, wages being the objective representation of real subjective and living work.Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 114 But capitalism progressively gives way to the exclusion of subjectivity by modern technology, which replaces living work by automated technological processes, eliminating at one stroke the power of creating value and ultimately value itself: possessions are produced in abundance, but unemployment increases and there is a continual shortage of money to buy them.Michel Henry, Du communisme au capitalisme, éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 161 et 174 These themes are developed in Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d’une catastrophe (From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe). The initial title of this book should have been The two faces death, but this title has been refused by the editor 'for obvious reasons of international actuality', as confided Michel Henry in an interview with Olivier Salazar-Ferrer published in 1991 in the Agones review.Michel Henry, Entretiens, article \\"Entretien avec Olivier Salazar-Ferrer\\", Éditions Sulliver, 2005, Michel Henry, Pour une phénoménologie de la vie. Entretien avec Olivier Salazar-Ferrer, Editions de Coulevour, 2010, = On Culture and Barbarism = Barbarism (1987)  In his essay Barbarism, Michel Henry examines science, which is founded on the idea of a universal and as such objective truth, and which therefore leads to the elimination of the sensible qualities of the world, sensibility and life.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 49 et 111 There is nothing wrong with science in itself as long as it is restricted to the study of nature, but it tends to exclude all traditional forms of culture, such as art, ethics and religion.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 49 Science left to its own devices leads to technology, whose blind processes develop themselves independently in a monstrous fashion with no reference to life.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 70 Science is a form of culture in which life denies itself and refuses itself any value. It is a practical negation of life,Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 113 which develops into a theoretical negation in the form of ideologies that reduces all possible knowledge to that of science, such as the human sciences whose very objectivity deprives them of their object: what value do statistics have faced with suicide, what do they say about the anguish and the despair that produce it?Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 131–164 These ideologies have invaded the university, and are precipitating it to its destruction by eliminating life from research and teaching.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 201–239 Television is the truth of technology; it is the practice par excellence of barbarism: it reduces every event to current affairs, to incoherent and insignificant facts.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 190–199 This negation of life results, according to Michel Henry, from the \\"disease of life\\", from its secret dissatisfaction with the self which leads it to deny itself, to flee itself in order to escape its anguish and its own suffering.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 49 In the modern world, we are almost all condemned from childhood to flee our anguish and our proper life in the mediocrity of the media universe — an escape from self and a dissatisfaction which lead to violence — rather than resorting to the most highly developed traditional forms of culture which enable the overcoming of this suffering and its transformation into joy.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pP. 174–183 Culture subsists, despite everything, but in a kind of incognito; in our materialist society, which is sinking into barbarism, it must necessarily operate in a clandestine way.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 241–247  Seeing the invisible: On Kandinsky (1988)  Michel Henry was a student of ancient painting and of the great classical painting which preceded the scientistic figuration of the 18th and 19th Centuries, and also of abstract creations such as those of the painter Wassily Kandinsky.Michel Henry, Auto-donation. Entretiens et conférences, éd. Beauschene, 2004, pp. 263–265. Henry dedicated a book entitled Voir l’invisible (Seeing the Invisible) to Kandinsky, in which he describes his work in laudatory terms.Michel Henry, Voir l'invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, par exemple pp. 240–244. He analyses Kandinsky's theoretical writings on art and painting in their spiritual and cultural dimensions as a means of self-growth and refinement of one's sensibility.Michel Henry, Voir l'invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 10–11, pp. 26–43. He explores painting's means of form and colour, and studies their effects on the inner life of one who looks at them filled with wonder, following the rigorous and almost phenomenological analysis proposed by Kandinsky.Michel Henry, Voir l'invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 81–99 for point and line, and pp. 122–139 for colors. He explains that every form of painting capable of moving us is in reality abstract, i.e. it is not content to reproduce the world but seeks to express the invisible power and invisible life that we are.Michel Henry, Voir l'invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 216–227. He evokes also the great thought of Kandinsky, the synthesis of arts, their unity in the monumental art as well as the cosmic dimension of art.Michel Henry, Voir l'invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 176–190 on monumental art, and pp. 228–244 on art and the Cosmos. = On Religion and Christianity = I am the Truth (1996)  In C’est moi la Vérité, pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth: Towards a Philosophy of Christianity), Michel Henry confronts his phenomenology of life with the foundational texts of Christianity. Life loves itself with an infinite love and never ceases to engender itself; it never ceases to engender each one of us as its beloved Son or Daughter in the eternal present of life. Life is nothing but this absolute love that religion calls God.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 2, p. 44) That is why Life is sacred, and it is for this reason that no-one has the right to assault another or attack another's life.See for example C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 10) and La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987 (chapitre 7, p. 221) The problem of evil is that of the inner and phenomenological \\"death\\" of the apparently or externally \\"living\\" individuals who do it; that is in reality, of the inner, affective and spiritual degeneration from their original condition of Son of God, when life they carry in them \\"turns\\" against itself in the terrible phenomena of hate and resentment.Michel Henry, La barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, .Michel Henry, Barbarism, Continuum, 2012, .Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 10, ).Michel Henry, I am the Truth: Toward a philosophy of Christianity, Stanford University Press, 2002, .Antoine Vidalin, La Parole de la Vie, éd. Parole et silence, 2006, . Because as John says in his first epistle, anyone who does not love remains in death, whereas everyone who loves has been born of God.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 9, p. 203 et § 10, p. 236), quotations of 1 John 3, 14 and 1 John 4, 7 The commandment of love is not an ethical law, but Life itself.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 10, p. 235)Michel Henry, I am the Truth: Toward a philosophy of Christianity, Stanford University Press, 2002, . This work also proposes a phenomenology of Christ, who is understood as the First Living Being. A living being is simply that which succeeds in the pure revelation of self or self-revelation that is Life. It is in the form of an effective and singular Ipseity that Life never ceases to engender itself. It never ceases to occur in the form of a singular Self that embraces itself, experiences itself and finds joy in itself, and that Michel Henry calls the First Living Being. Or again the Arch-Son, as he himself inhabits the Origin and the Beginning, and is engendered in the very process whereby the Father engenders himself.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 4, pp. 73–77) Michel Henry tells us in this book that the purpose of the coming of Christ into the world is to make the true Father manifest to people, and thus to save them from the forgetting of Life in which they stand.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 8, pp. 166–191) A forgetting which leads them falsely to believe themselves as being the source of their own powers, their own pleasures and their own feelings, and to live in the terrifying lack of that which however gives each ego to itself. The plenitude of life and the feeling of satisfaction it brings must yield to the great Rift, to the Desire that no object can fulfill, to the Hunger that nothing can satisfy.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 11, pp. 255–260)  Words of Christ (2002)  As Henry says in his last book Paroles du Christ (Words of Christ), it is in the heart that life speaks, in its immediate pathetic self-revelation; but the heart is blind to the Truth, it is deaf to the word of Life, it is hard and selfish, and it is from this that evil comes.Michel Henry, Paroles du Christ, éd. du Seuil, 2002 (pp. 122, 134) It is in the violence of its silent and implacable self-revelation, which bears witness against this degenerate life and against the evil that comes from it, that Judgement stands — Judgement which is identical to the advent of each Self to itself and from which none can escape.Michel Henry, Paroles du Christ, éd. du Seuil, 2002 (pp. 123–124)  Incarnation. A philosophy of Flesh (2000)  In Incarnation. A philosophy of Flesh, Henry starts by opposing the sensible and living flesh as we experience it perpetually from the inside to the inert and material body as we can see it from the outside, like other objects we find in the world.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, pp. 8–9) The flesh does not correspond at all, in his terminology, to the soft part of our material and objective body as opposed for example to the bones, but to what he called in his earlier books our subjective body.Michel Henry, Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps, PUF, 1987 (pp. 71–105) For Henry, an object possesses no interiority, it is not living, it does not feel itself and does not feel that it is touched, it does not subjectively experience being touched. Having put the difficult problem of the incarnation in a historical perspective by going back to the thought of the Church Fathers, he undertakes a critical re-reading of the phenomenological tradition that leads to a reversal of phenomenology.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 35–132 He then proposes to elaborate a phenomenology of the flesh which leads to the notion of an originary flesh which is not constituted but is given in the arch-revelation of Life, as well as a phenomenology of Incarnation. Although the flesh is traditionally understood as the seat of sin, in Christianity it is also the place of salvation, which consists in the deification of man, i.e. in the fact of becoming the Son of God, of returning to the eternal and absolute Life we had forgotten in losing ourselves in the world, in caring only about things and ourselves.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, p. 23)Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 9, pp. 207) In sin, we have the tragic experience of our powerlessness to do the good we would like to do and of our inability to avoid evil.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 34, p. 254) Thus, faced with the magical body of the other, it is the anguished desire to rejoin the life in it that leads to error.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 39, p. 291) In the night of lovers, the sexual act couples two impulsive movements, but erotic desire fails to attain the pleasure of the other just there where it is experienced, in a complete loving fusion.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 41, pp. 301–302) The erotic relation is however doubled by a pure affective relation, foreign to the carnal coupling, a relation made of mutual gratitude or love.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 41, p. 304) It is this affective dimension that is denied in the form of violence that is pornography, which wrenches the erotic relation from the pathos of life in order to deliver it to the world, and which constitutes a genuine profanation of life.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 43, p. 315)  Descriptions of selected works  On Economy and Politics = * Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d'une catastrophe (From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe): The collapse of the eastern communist systems corresponds to the bankruptcy of a system that claimed to deny the reality of life in favour of falsely universal abstractions. But death is also at the meeting-point in the empire of capitalism and of modern technology. = On Culture and Barbarism = * La barbarie (Barbarism): Culture, which is the self-development of life, is threatened in our society by the barbarism of the monstrous objectivity of technoscience, whose ideologies reject all form of subjectivity, while life is condemned to escape its anguish in the media universe. * Voir l'invisible, sur Kandinsky (Seeing the Invisible, about Kandinsky): Art can save man, abandoned by our technological civilization, from his confusion. This is this spiritual quest that led Kandinsky to the creation of abstract painting. It is no longer a matter of representing the world but our inner life, by means of lines and colors that correspond to inner forces and sonorities. = On Religion and Christianity = * (I am the Truth: Toward a Philosophy of Christianity): This book explains the kind of truth that Christianity tries to transmit to Man. Christianity opposes to the truth of the world the Truth of Life, according to which man is the Son of God. The self-revelation of Life which experiences itself in its invisible interiority is the essence of God in which each individual is grounded. In the world, Jesus has the appearance of a man, but it is in the Truth of Life that he is the Christ, the First Living Being. * Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of Flesh): The living flesh is radically opposed to the material body, because it is the flesh which, experiencing itself, enjoying itself in accordance with ever-renewed impressions, is able to feel the body which is exterior to it, to touch it and to be touched by it. It is the flesh which allows us to know the body. The fundamental teaching of the prologue to the Gospel according to St. John, who says that the Word became flesh, asserts the improbable thesis that God incarnated himself in a mortal flesh like ours — it asserts the unity of the Word and the flesh in Christ. What is it for flesh to be the place of God's revelation, and in what does this revelation consist? * Paroles du Christ (Words of Christ): Can man understand in his own language the word of God, a word that speaks in another language? The words of the Christ seem to many to be an immoderate claim because they claim not only to transmit the truth or a divine revelation, but to be this Revelation and this Truth, the Word of God himself, of this God that Christ himself claims to be. = Literary works = * Le jeune officier (The Young Officer): This first novel evokes the struggle of a young officer against evil, embodied by rats on a ship. * L'amour les yeux fermés (Love With Closed Eyes): This novel, which won the Renaudot Prize, is the account of the destruction of a city which has reached the peak of its development and refinement and which is suffering from an insidious evil. * Le fils du roi (The Son of the King): A story of life locked up in a psychiatric hospital and confronted by the rationality of psychiatrists. * Le cadavre indiscret (The Indiscreet Corpse): In this novel, Henry tells us of the anxiety of the assassins of the secret and too honest treasurer of a political party, who finance an investigation to discover what is really known about them and to reassure themselves.

The game was conceptualised in 2003 by Ben Duskin—an 8 year old American boy in remission from leukemia and was published by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Summary When interviewed by Make-A-Wish, Ben's wish was to design a video game in which cancer cells were eaten to help other children visualize fighting their cancer and help them to cope with cancer treatments. He remembered his oncologist telling him to think of chemotherapy as eating cancer cells. When Make-A-Wish first approached gaming companies - their requests to help create a cancer-fighting video game were denied. Make-a-Wish Executive Director Patricia Wilson was told that a video game would take upwards of US$1,000,000 and possibly years to create. Ms. Wilson sought the help of her Board of Directors and within days the request to fulfill Ben's wish was posted on several gaming sites. Inquiries and offers to assist began immediately from game designers in the UK, Israel, Canada and the United States. One particular offer came from a Bay Area game designer who offered to spearhead the entire game design on one condition: that he have a chance to meet and work with Ben directly. Eric Johnston, a software engineer from LucasArts met with Ben weekly for 6 months and together, they created Ben's Game. Ben's own pediatric oncologist served as medical adviser for the game upon condition that UCSF Children's Hospital be the first medical facility to have the game installed for children to play. The game was launched in May 2004 and as of September 2009, the game has been downloaded over 300,000 times by people all over the world. Ben's Game is freeware, available for Mac and Windows systems, and is multilingual (with support for 9 languages.) The game was made available online for free download for a period of time. Duskin and Johnston were awarded the \\"Unsung Hero of Compassion\\" by the Dalai Lama on 6 November 2005. In 2007 another wish child, Jericho Rajninger, was inspired by Ben and Ben's Game and decided to use his wish to help other children as well. Jericho's wish, J.R. the Robot, delivers medication to children in the hospital. Theme With a child patient as the hero miniaturized to microscopic level adventuring inside the child's own body, the object is to destroy all cancer cells and to collect the seven shields against common side effects of chemotherapy. Each shield is guarded by a \\"monster\\"—an incarnation of one of those side effects. The game was designed so that the player character never loses or dies. Gameplay Ben's Game gameplay. The \\"Vamp monster\\" is visible in the background. The gameplay can be described as a three-dimensional version of Asteroids, but instead of a ship, the player character is the child patient on a hoverboard. The left and right arrow keys spin the direction of the ship, the up arrow accelerates and the down brakes. There are 4 weapons available: Sword, Crossbow, Blaster and Missile, each of them having different types of projectiles. The player also has built-in ammo. The game objective is to destroy all of the mutated cells. In addition, there are seven shields. Each shield protects against one of the common side effects of chemotherapy and is guarded by a \\"monster\\" that represents that side effect. The seven monsters and side effects are as follows: Iceman monster (colds), Robarf monster (vomiting and nausea), Big Chicken monster (chicken pox), Fire monster (fever), Vamp monster (bleeding), Qball monster (hair loss), and the Tornado monster (rash.) The player's ammunition consists of health (which comes from a hospital), ammo (which comes from a pharmacy), and attitude (which comes from home.) The game also features camera control and a two-player mode. There are 12 characters and 6 boards available, however, it has a character/board creation feature, as the textures (and their \\"masks\\", which are white silhouettes that cut the black area, leaving only the character image to be seen) are normal JPEG files that can be copied and edited, to make new characters and/or boards.

The first version of the antivirus program was basic, had no inbuilt update facility (updates had to be obtained from a BBS and manually installed by the user) and could scan for 1,234 different viruses.List of viruses detectable by MSAV Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows (MWAV), included as part of the package, was a front end that allowed MSAV to run properly on Windows 3.1x.  History  Microsoft Anti-Virus was supplied by Central Point Software Inc. (later acquired by Symantec in 1994 and integrated into Symantec's Norton AntiVirus product) and was a stripped down version of the Central Point Anti-Virus (CPAV) product which Central Point Software Inc., had licensed from Carmel Software Engineering in Haifa, Israel. Carmel Software sold the product as Turbo Anti-Virus both domestically and abroad. Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows was also provided by Central Point Software.  Features  MSAV featured the \\"Detect and Clean\\" strategy and the detection of boot sector and Trojan horse-type viruses (which were typical virus problems at that time). The program also had an anti-stealth and check sum feature that could be used to detect any changes in normal files. This technology was intended to make up for the unavailability of regular update packages. The final update of MSAV was released in June 1996 by Symantec. The update added the ability to detect polymorphic viruses and the virus definitions were updated to scan for a total of 2,371 viruses. = VSafe TSR = VSafe TSR running on MS-DOS 6.22 VSafe was a terminate and stay resident component of MSAV that provided real-time virus protection.

H. Brennan. The books are illustrated by John Higgins. The stories follow the adventures of a young hero named Pip, who is often called upon by Merlin to right wrongs and save the realm from evil. The series is light in tone and does not take itself seriously, often spoofing the fantasy genre and inserting slapstick humor or nonsensical elements. The series is mostly set in King Arthur's realm of Avalon, although the fourth volume, Voyage of Terror, takes place almost entirely in ancient Greece, after Merlin's summoning spell goes wrong. While there were eight total books published in the series, books seven and eight were never published in the United States.  Characters  *Pip: The hero of the series. Pip was brought up on a farm as the adopted child of Freeman John and his wife Miriam. One day, soldiers from King Arthur's court arrived to escort Pip to Merlin's log castle, where Merlin assigned the young adventurer the mission of rescuing Queen Guinevere from the evil Wizard Ansalom. Pip fights (and sometimes argues) with a magical sword, Excalibur Junior, and often wears a sturdy dragonhide jacket when adventuring. Pip is never assigned a gender pronoun by anyone in the books and as such could be a female hero, though the assumption is usually taken that Pip is a young boy. Pip does declare himself lord of the jungle at one point, and EJ, referring to Pip, says \\"unhand him, varlet!\\". *Merlin: The (supposedly) wise old wizard. He introduces each adventure and is usually the one who gives Pip his mission, providing Pip with items and some magic. Merlin tends to be sarcastic and grumpy, not to mention eccentric. However, even though he treats Pip like a foolish child, he still cares about the young adventurer. In one of the series' running jokes, Merlin acquires a new, bizarre home in every volume. *Cody: Merlin's young apprentice, introduced in Legion of the Dead, who brings Pip to Avalon via the Net Spell after Merlin disappears and is presumed dead following a fall from a tree. *Excalibur Junior (E.J.): Pip's magical talking sword. It was created by Merlin, who based its design on King Arthur's sword (hence the \\"Junior\\"). E.J. is quite powerful but has the annoying tendency of speaking its mind at inconvenient times, and can even refuse to be pulled from its scabbard (showing an ability similar to its namesake) when in a bad mood. E.J. also suffers from arachnophobia, which is a disadvantage when Pip runs into giant spiders. *The Poetic Fiend: A vampire poet who is a recurring character through the series. The Fiend believes that he is a great poet, when in actuality his verse tends more towards doggerel (and has been known to make even cockroaches throw up when he gives a recital). He is often helpful to Pip, as long as Pip is diplomatic in his criticism of the Fiend's poetry. In the English-language books, the Fiend is unnamed. In the French translations, however, he is known as Nosferax. *King Arthur: Ruler of the realm of Avalon. He is rarely encountered by the player in person, but is a prominent and influential figure in the series. He is usually the one who gives missions to Pip by the way of Merlin. *King Pellinore: King Pellinore of Listinoise appears in the first few books as a running gag, where he is often confused for the Black Knight because of his dark armor. Often it is Pellinore who is assigned the task of taking care of whatever problem is plaguing Camelot, with Pip only coming in later after the poor old king gets himself hopelessly lost. *The Wizard Ansalom: An evil black-magic-using wizard, who is the main villain in the very first adventure. He returns as a ghost when Pip visits the Ghastly Kingdom of the Dead and Pip discovers that some of his dark influence remains in the last volume. *The Black Knight: The Black Knight of old legend is the main villain in one of Pip's adventures. He seems to appear in several volumes, but those other appearances are actually King Pellinore (see above).  Titles  # The Castle of Darkness (1984) # The Den of Dragons (1984) # The Gateway of Doom (1984) # Voyage of Terror (1985) # Kingdom of Horror (1985) # Realm of Chaos (1986) # Tomb of Nightmares (1986) # Legion of the Dead (1987)  Combat  The rules of GrailQuest are quite simple when compared to current RPGs. The player must roll two six-sided dice and add the results. If the result exceeds 6 (which will happen 58.3% of the time), then the enemy is injured and loses a number of Life Points - how much depends on what the dice shows, as every point over 6 will count as a point of damage. When a character's Life Points reach zero, the character is dead, and when they are at 5, they are knocked out. If wielding a weapon, the number needed to hit may be lower, and extra damage will usually be inflicted. For instance, Excalibur Junior hits on a roll of 4 (hitting 91.7% of the time) and provides a bonus 5 points of damage. There is no defence roll, but damage is reduced by a set amount by any armor the character is wearing. Initiative is determined by an initial, opposed roll where the highest roll gets the first attack. From then on, the character and the enemy take turns to attack. Surprise is sometimes involved (for example, in Gateway of Doom, a giant spider gets first strike automatically due to Pip being in its home territory). If the character dies, the player must go to section 14, which describes his afterdeath and tells him to calculate his Life Points again. Merlin then resurrects Pip, who has to start from the beginning of the adventure again - although some books will only require him to start from a certain point, such as Gateway of Doom allows Pip to restart at the beginning of the Ghastly Kingdom of the Dead, or Realm of Chaos allows him to start from the beginning of a certain location. However, all previously killed enemies remain dead, and any treasure the player found is gone for good. (In some books, killed enemies return to life with half the Life Points they had the first time around.)  Magic spells  In some of the books, Merlin provides Pip with magic spells. In the first book, Pip has only two spells - ten firefingers (lightning bolts) and two powerful fireballs. The firefinger lightning bolts hit automatically for a straight 10 points of damage, while the fireballs score a massive 75 points of damage each, but require a 6 or better on two dice or else they miss completely. = Pip's First Spell Book = In the second book, Merlin provides Pip with a spell book. This provides Pip with more spells of various uses in and out of combat. Pip also receives ten new firefingers (different from the firefingers on the previous book) and two new fireballs. If the player has finished the first book, he can keep any unspent spells from the previous book, and also the dragonhide jacket, which would otherwise be unavailable. Pip's use of magic is limited by three rules that must be adhered to at all times. First, every spell thrown costs three Life Points whether it is cast successfully or not. Second, no spell can be thrown more than three times in any given adventure (and once thrown, it is used whether or not it is successfully cast). And third, no spell thrown is successfully cast unless a 7 or better is rolled on two dice. *Pip's Armour of Nearly Impenetrable Coruscation (P.A.N.I.C. for short) - Throws a shimmering wall of light around the caster for the duration of a single combat, which deducts four points of damage scored against Pip in addition to any other protection or armour worn. *Pip's Outlandish Wallop (P.O.W. for short) - Adds +10 damage to the next attack Pip makes on top of any other attack bonuses. *Pip's Instant Levity and Laughter (P.I.L.L. for short) - Causes a single enemy to laugh so hard that he or she misses the next three consecutive turns in combat. *Pip's Attacking Dart (P.A.D. for short) - Allows Pip to launch a ranged attack for a straight 10 damage against an opponent who is otherwise out of combat range. An enemy hit with the dart can only counter-attack if he or she has ranged weaponry or spells of his or her own. *Pip's Immunity to Poison (P.I.P. for short) - If cast before poison is taken, it completely counteracts the effects of the poison. The spell does not function if cast after Pip has already been poisoned, however. *Pip's Instant Neutralizer (P.I.N. for short) - Counteracts one spell or enchantment placed on an object (not a living being). It is useful for opening a chest or door which has been magically locked, for example. *Pip's Immense Rapid Repeater (Pi R squared for short) - Doubles Pip's speed during a single combat, allowing Pip to get in two attacks for every one made by an opponent. *Invisibility (I.N.V.I.S.I.B.I.L.I.T.Y. for short) - This spell is an exception to the normal rules of magic in that it can only be cast once per adventure for a cost of 15 Life Points, and only in designated areas, but the effect renders Pip completely invisible. *Firefinger - This spell is an exception to the normal rules of magic in that it can only be successfully cast once per adventure. It gives Pip 10 Firefinger lightning bolts (five in each hand) which can be fired immediately or stored for later use. *Fireball - Like the Firefinger spell, it can only be successfully cast once per adventure. It gives Pip 2 fireballs which can be thrown immediately or stored for later use. = Pip's Second Spell Book = In the third book, Merlin provides Pip with a new spell book. When Pip wonders why this second spell book is shorter than the first one, Merlin tells Pip that spell books require a great deal of research and development, making them quite expensive, and he is not made of money. These spells follow the same three rules of magic described in the second book. *Pip's Patent Lock Picker (P.L.O.P. for short) - Will pick one non-magic lock per section on a throw of 6 or better on two dice. *Pip's Incredible Duncher (P.I.D. for short) - Creates a magical cap which, when worn, shrinks Pip to the size of six inches, thus allowing travel through small passageways. Pip returns to normal size in the next section. *Pip's Amazing Legume Spell (P.A.L.S. for short) - If Pip should come under attack by any sort of vegetable, this spell guarantees an automatic Friendly Reaction from said vegetable. *Pip's Instant Levitation (P.I.L. for short) - Allows Pip to levitate straight up or down, but if used indoors it causes a concussion when you hit the ceiling and the loss of half your current Life Points. *Pip's Obliging Power Sword (P.O.P.S. for short) - If cast before a hit roll in combat, it causes E.J. to score double damage on the next strike, but only half damage on the hit after that. Spell books, Firefingers, Fireballs, the dragonhide jacket and even E.J. are not available in the fourth book. Both spell books are also unavailable in books five and six; in the former case because Merlin has run out of time, and in the latter because no magic will work on account of the curse on Camelot.  Running Jokes  *In every book, once you are killed you have to turn to the infamous section 14. This rule is true for all of J.H. Brennan's gamebooks, except the Demonspawn series where the killed player must go to the section 13. *Merlin's eccentricities are showcased in each book with Merlin acquiring a new dwelling, more bizarre and off-the-wall than the last. In Castle of Darkness, Merlin lives in a log castle. He's moved to a crystal cave in Den of Dragons. By Gateway of Doom, he has moved into the lightning-blasted remains of an ancient druid oak. Voyage of Terror shows Merlin trying out a magical bubble spell which places a home of sorts at the bottom of the well in the town square of Glastonbury Village. In Kingdom of Horror he has created a home in the shape of a large six-sided die up in the Welsh Mountains. Realm of Chaos actually showcases two of Merlin's homes: the first being the enormous barrel- shaped house he is living in at the beginning, and the second one being a sort of abandoned fortress in the Astral Plane. Tomb of Nightmares has Merlin living inside a hollowed-out roc egg, presented to King Arthur by a drunken Arab sailor and given to the wizard when the King had no other idea of what to do with it. Only the final book in the series omits specific details about Merlin's home, though wherever it stands, there is a one-way door out of it which leads into Hell. *In Realm of Chaos, Pip finds a book \\"about some idiot called Fire*Wolf\\", who is the hero of Demonspawn, another series by J.H. Brennan. *Upon meeting Pip, most people recognize him as \\"...the one that put paid to old Ansalom, eh?\\" Ansalom, as previously noted, was the villain in the first book. In addition, the further along in the series one gets, the more titles get appended to Pip's name. By the end of the series, Pip is known as the Wizard Basher, Dragon Slayer, Gateway Closer, Realm Saver, and Chaos Tamer and is often addressed by all of those titles at once by Merlin or E.J. and often at times when brevity would be far better for the circumstances.

Telle est la tâche de la phénoménologie matérielle\\". The relevant philosophical project is called \\"radical phenomenology of life\\" (phénoménologie radicale de la vie) or \\"material phenomenology of life\\" (phénoménologie matérielle de la vie). This part of phenomenology has been developed by the French philosopher Michel Henry, since his fundamental book on The Essence of ManifestationMichel Henry, L’Essence de la manifestation, PUF, collection \\"Epiméthée\\", 1963. Translation in English : Michel Henry (Author), Girard J. Etzkorn (Translator) : The Essence of Manifestation, The Hague : Nijhoff, 1973. ; it studies the subjective life of individuals in its pathetic and affective reality as pure impression.Michel Henry, Phénoménologie matérielle, PUF, collection \\"Epiméthée\\", 1990, p. 16 : \\"« Matière » désigne d'abord l'essence de l'impression ou ce qui lui est originellement et en soi identique, la sensation. La matière est justement la matière dont l'impression est faite, son étoffe, sa substance en quelque sorte : l'impressionnel, le sensuel comme tels\\".  Definition  The philosopher Michel Henry defines life from a phenomenological point of view as that which possesses the faculty and the power \\"of feeling and experiencing oneself in each point of its being\\".Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15, 23 et 80 For Michel Henry, life is essentially subjective force and affectivity Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, cover page — it consists of a pure subjective experience of oneself which perpetually oscillates between suffering and joy.Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 122 Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, p. 109 : \\"Ainsi, en dépit de sa simplicité, et à cause de son caractère dynamique (force) et pathétique (affect), le \\"vivre\\" est affectivité (jouissance et souffrance), mais il est aussi pulsion, désir, volonté, agir (praxis), pensée (représentation)\\". A \\"subjective force\\" is not an impersonal, blind and insensitive force like the objective forces we meet in nature, but a living and sensible force experienced from within and resulting from an inner desire and a subjective effort of the will to satisfy it.Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 211-212 Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 138 et 218 Starting from this phenomenological approach to life, in Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 8-9. Michel Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body, which is in principle insensible. The word \\"phenomenological\\" refers to phenomenology, which is the study of phenomena and a philosophical method which fundamentally concerns the study of phenomena as they appear.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, p. 35 What Henry calls \\"absolute phenomenological life\\" is the subjective life of individuals reduced to its pure inner manifestation, as we perpetually live it and feel it.Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15-16 Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 46-70 It is life as it reveals itself and appears inwardly, its self-revelation: life is both what reveals and what is revealed.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 39-40  Properties  Life is by nature invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of a look; it reveals itself in itself without gap or distance.Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, p. 164 : \\"[...] ce qui est invisible ne cesse jamais, en raison de son invisibilité, de se manifester, bien que son apparence, qui est bien réelle, n'appartienne pas à l'ordre de la visibilité. Elle est, cette apparence, de l'ordre de l'affectivité. Car un sentiment ne se voit pas, mais se manifeste, et il se manifeste en se laissant éprouver, mieux encore : en s'éprouvant soi-même\\". The fact of seeing does in effect presuppose the existence of a distance and of a separation between what is seen and the one who sees, between the object that is perceived and the subject who perceives it.Michel Henry, L’Essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 50-51, pp. 549-571). A feeling, for example, can never be seen from the exterior, it never appears in the \\"horizon of visibility\\" of the world; it feels itself and experiences itself from within in the radical immanence of life.Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, p. 175 : \\"[...] de ce qui se trouve donné au regard, à la sensibilité, à la perception, la philosophie se doit de remonter au fondement de la donation, un fondement qui, lui, ne saurait être donné comme quelque chose d'extérieur, qui n'est pas même visible, puisqu'il relève de la vie subjective absolue, dont le caractère d'essence est d'être tout à la fois pathétique et dynamique -- c'est-à-dire immanent\\". Love cannot see itself, any more than hatred; feelings are felt in the secrecy of our hearts, where no look can penetrate.Michel Henry, L’Essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 62-63, pp. 692-714). Life is constituted of sensitivity and affectivity — it is the unity of their manifestation, affectivity being however the essence of sensibility (as Henry shows in The Essence of Manifestation) which means that every sensation is affective by nature.Michel Henry, L’Essence de la manifestation, PUF, 1963 (§ 54, p. 602). Phenomenological life is the foundation of all our subjective experiences (like the subjective experience of a sorrow, of seeing a color or the pleasure of drinking fresh water in summer) and of each of our subjective powers (the subjective power of moving the hand or the eyes, for example).Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 7-8. In Incarnation, a philosophy of the flesh, Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body which is as a matter of principle insensitive.  Phenomenological vs. biological  This phenomenological definition of life is founded, then, in the concrete subjective experience we have of life in our own existence. It thus corresponds to human life.Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, pp. 30-31. In I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity, Michel Henry writes about the other forms of life studied by biology and from which Heidegger derives his own philosophical conception of life:Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 46-70 \\"Is it not paradoxical for anyone who wants to know what life is to go and ask protozoa or, in the best case, honeybees? As if our only relation with life was a wholly external and fragile relation with beings about whom we know nothing – or so very little! As if we ourselves were not living beings!\\"Michel Henry, I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity (§ 3, p. 47) This definition, however, fails to include living organisms that cannot experience themselves, such as plant life — unless one can find evidence of the existence of a certain kind of sensibility in them, as Professor A. Tronchet appears to suggest in his book La sensibilité des plantes (Plant Sensibility): \\"The protoplasm of plant cells, like that of animal cells, is endowed with irritability, i.e. a particular form of sensibility, thanks to which it is capable of being affected by excitations originating externally or internally\\".A. Tronchet, La sensibilité des plantes, Masson, 1977, p. 1.  The Truth of Life  Michel Henry explains in C’est Moi la Vérité. Pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity) what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls \\"the Truth of Life\\".Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 32-45. He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth, which originates in Greek thought and which he calls \\"the truth of the world\\".Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 21-31 But what is truth? Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 19-22 Antoine Vidalin : La parole de la Vie, Parole et silence, 2006, pp. 79-95. The truth of the world designates an external and objective truth, a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us, i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows:Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 25-31. when we look at an apple, it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way, when we look at a person's face, it is not the person in herself that we see, but only an image of her face, her visible appearance in the world.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 29-30 According to this way of conceiving truth, life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised (for example) by the need to feed oneself or one's aptitude for reproduction.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 58-64. Christian thought In Christianity, Life is reduced to its internal reality, which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40 Considered in its phenomenological reality, Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations, small pleasures or great hurts, to experience desires and feelings, to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort, or even to think.Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 7-8.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 173. All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves, with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze, but only in us: we coincide with each of these abilities.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 42-43 Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation, and what it manifests is itself, in its feeling self-revelationMichel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 36-37 et 73 — it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167 Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, p. 112 : \\"La vie est auto-manifestation et en tant que telle, en tant qu'elle participe d'une manifestation dont elle est elle-même le principe, elle peut, elle doit même recevoir le nom de vérité. Seulement cette vérité qui est la sienne ne relève plus de la représentation, ni du jugement. Cette vérité-là est une vérité vivante et incarnée\\". The Truth of Life is absolutely subjective — that is, it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain, for example, is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the absolute subjectivity of Life.See for example Michel Henry, Paroles du Christ, Éditions du Seuil, 2002, p. 97. The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true, it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 36 Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation, and Life is what Christianity calls God.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40 Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska : Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie, Beauchesne, 2003, pp. 172-176. The Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another, but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities, and which illuminates the least of our impressions.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 135 The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary, it is that which is most essential for man, as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God, rather than losing himself in the world.Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 7 Paul Audi : Michel Henry : Une trajectoire philosophique, Les Belles Lettres, 2006, pp. 227-252. Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska : Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie, Beauchesne, 2003, p. 245 : \\"Car le salut, en effet, ne consiste en rien d'autre que dans la vie éternelle que le philosophe [Michel Henry] élucide et qui se donne à vivre comme une naissance sans commencement ni fin au sein du Logos pathétique et de sa Parousie\\".

The Cambridge CAP computer was the first successful experimental computer that demonstrated the use of security capabilities, both in hardware and software.Levy, p.96 It was developed at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in the 1970s. Unlike most research machines of the time, it was also a useful service machine. The sign currently on the front of the machine reads: > The CAP project on memory protection ran from 1970 to 1977.

Design The CAP was designed such that any access to a memory segment or hardware required that the current process held the necessary capabilities. Cambridge Ring. The 32-bit processor featured microprogramming control, two 256-entry caches, a 32-entry write buffer and the capability unit itself, which had 64 registers for holding evaluated capabilities. Floating point operations were available using a single 72-bit accumulator. The instruction set featured over 200 instructions, including basic ALU and memory operations, to capability- and process-control instructions. Instead of the programmer- visible registers used in Chicago and Plessey System 250 designs, the CAP would load internal registers silently when a program defined a capability.Levy, p. 79 The memory was divided into segments of up to 64K 32-bit words. Each segment could contain data or capabilities, but not both. Hardware was accessed via an associated minicomputer. All procedures constituting the operating system were written in ALGOL 68C, although a number of other closely associated protected procedures - such as a paginator - are written in BCPL.Wilkes and Needham, p. 32 Operation The CAP first became operational in 1976. A fully functional computer, it featured a complete operating system, file system, compilers, and so on. The OS used a process tree structure, with an initial process called the \\"Master coordinator\\". This removed the need for separate modes of operation, as each process could directly access the resources of its children. In practice, only two levels were ever used during the CAP's operation.Levy, p. 81 In 1981 the MACRO SPITBOL version of the SNOBOL4 programming language was implemented on the CAP by Nicholas J. L.

His first album as a solo artist garnered three Spanish-language hits in Venezuela. He signed with the CBS Records label in 1989, and in 1990, his album Extranjero had a song that reached No. 1 on the United States Latin charts and won an MTV Video Music Award. His 2004 album Stop reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the United States Latin charts. In the United States alone, he has scored more than two dozen hits on the Billboard charts.Cordova, Randy.\\" Franco de Vita talks inspiration, influences, 5/10.\\" The Arizona Republic. May 5, 2015. Career1980s= One of four children born in Venezuela to Italian immigrants, De Vita's family returned to Rome, Italy when he was 3. The family moved back to Venezuela when De Vita was 13. Due to his upbringing in Rome, Italy, De Vita learned Italian as his first language and did not learn Spanish until he returned to Venezuela at age 13. He later studied piano at the university level. In 1982, De Vita formed the group Icaro, which released one self-titled album in his homeland. Two years later, he released his first disc as a solo artist, simply titled Franco De Vita (1984). The album spun off three Spanish-language hits: \\"Somos Tres\\", \\"No Hay Cielo\\", and \\"Un Buen Perdedor\\". His 1986 in album Fantasía produced several more hits, including the title song and \\"Aquí Estás Otra Vez\\". \\"Sólo Importas Tú\\", taken from the album, was used as the theme song to the Spanish-language soap opera La Dama De Rosa. He appeared in the end credits of every episode, performing the song at the piano. Seeking wider international exposure, De Vita moved to the CBS Records label for the 1988 album Al Norte del Sur. The album showed his socially conscious, adult-oriented pop, particularly through the tunes \\"Te Amo\\" and \\"Louis\\". The latter song, about a daydreaming cabbie who idolizes The Beatles, was promoted with a music video considered quite advanced for its time. De Vita's 1990 album Extranjero featured the song \\"No Basta\\", which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the United States Latin charts and won an MTV Video Music Award. =1990s= Subsequent albums have included the live release En Vivo Marzo 16 (1992); Voces a mi Alrededor in 1993; the acoustic- flavored Fuera de Este Mundo (1996); and 1999's world-beat inspired Nada Es Igual. He left Sony for the 2002 album Segundas partes también son buenas, but returned to the label the following year. =2000s= His 2004 album Stop reached the Top 10 throughout Latin America and on the United States Latin charts, spurred by the hits \\"Tú De Qué Vas\\" and \\"Si La Ves,\\" the latter a collaboration with pop group Sin Bandera. That same year, he toured arenas in the United States on a co-headlining tour with Ricardo Montaner, a fellow Argentine-Venezuelan songwriter. He also has recorded in Italian and Portuguese. As a songwriter, he has written songs for Ricky Martin and Chayanne. In 2005, an expanded edition of Stop was released, titled Stop + Algo Más, that included remixes and live recordings, as well as No Sé Lo Que Me Das, De Vita's first recording in English. The following year saw the release of Mil y Una Historias En Vivo, a two-disc live album that also featured four studio tracks, including collaborations with Alejandro Fernández and Diego El Cigala. A DVD version was released simultaneously. In 2007, De Vita collaborated on a single with reggaeton duo Wisin & Yandel called \\"Oye Donde Esta El Amor\\", which borrowed the chorus from his composition \\"Donde Esta El Amor.\\" They released an updated version of \\"Un Buen Perdedor\\" that peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. In 2008, he re- recorded \\"Que No Muera La Esperanza\\" (originally featured on Voces A Mi Alrededor) with Wisin & Yandel, as well as releasing a new studio album, Simplemente La Verdad. =2010s= In 2012, De Vita appeared on Tony Bennett's album Viva Duets. He was named Pop Artist of the Year at the 2012 Pepsi Venezuela Music Awards. In 2014, De Vita was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music of Fame. =Personal life= De Vita has lived in Madrid since the '90s. In addition to Spanish and Italian, he also speaks English.

The immediate reactions to On the Origin of Species, the book in which Charles Darwin described evolution by natural selection, included international debate, though the heat of controversy was less than that over earlier works such as Vestiges of Creation. Darwin monitored the debate closely, cheering on Thomas Henry Huxley's battles with Richard Owen to remove clerical domination of the scientific establishment. While Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he read eagerly about them and mustered support through correspondence. Religious views were mixed, with the Church of England's scientific establishment reacting against the book, while liberal Anglicans strongly supported Darwin's natural selection as an instrument of God's design. Religious controversy was soon diverted by the publication of Essays and Reviews and debate over the higher criticism. The most famous confrontation took place at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, when the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce argued against Darwin's explanation. In the ensuing debate Joseph Hooker argued strongly in favor of Darwinian evolution. Thomas Huxley's support of evolution was so intense that the media and public nicknamed him \\"Darwin's bulldog\\". Huxley became the fiercest defender of the evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. Both sides came away feeling victorious, but Huxley went on to depict the debate as pivotal in a struggle between religion and science and used Darwinism to campaign against the authority of the clergy in education, as well as daringly advocating the \\"Ape Origin of Man\\". Background Darwin's ideas developed rapidly after returning from the Voyage of the Beagle in 1836. By December 1838, he had developed the basic principles of his theory. At that time, similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob. He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing. While he continued with research, he had an immense amount of work in hand analyzing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition, and was repeatedly delayed by illness. Natural history at that time was dominated by clerical naturalists who saw their science as revealing God's plan, and whose income came from the Established Church of England. Darwin found three close allies. The eminent geologist Charles Lyell, whose books had influenced the young Darwin during the Voyage of the Beagle, befriended Darwin who he saw as a supporter of his ideas of gradual geological processes with continuing divine Creation of species. By the 1840s Darwin became friends with the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker who had followed his father into the science, and after going on a survey voyage used his contacts to eventually find a position. In the 1850s Darwin met Thomas Huxley, an ambitious naturalist who had returned from a long survey trip but lacked the family wealth or contacts to find a career and who joined the progressive group around Herbert Spencer looking to make science a profession, freed from the clerics. This was also a time of intense conflict over religious morality in England, where evangelicalism led to increasing professionalism of clerics who had previously been expected to act as country gentlemen with wide interests, but now were seriously focussed on expanded religious duties. A new orthodoxy proclaimed the virtues of truth but also inculcated beliefs that the Bible should be read literally and that religious doubt was in itself sinful so should not be discussed. Science was also becoming professional and a series of discoveries cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible and the honesty of those denying the findings. A series of crises erupted with fierce debate and criticism over issues such as George Combe's The Constitution of Man and the anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation which converted vast popular audiences to the belief that natural laws controlled the development of nature and society. German higher criticism questioned the Bible as a historical document in contrast to the evangelical creed that every word was divinely inspired. Dissident clergymen even began questioning accepted premises of Christian morality, and Benjamin Jowett's 1855 commentary on St. Paul brought a storm of controversy. By September 1854 Darwin's other books reached a stage where he was able to turn his attention fully to Species, and from this point he was working to publish his theory. On 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Alfred Russel Wallace enclosing about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism that was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin put matters in the hands of his friends Lyell and Hooker, who agreed on a joint presentation to the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. Their papers were entitled, collectively, On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. Darwin, as photographed in 1860 =Publication of The Origin of Species= Darwin now worked on an \\"abstract\\" trimmed from his Natural Selection manuscript. The publisher John Murray agreed the title as On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection and the book went on sale to the trade on 22 November 1859. The stock of 1,250 copies was oversubscribed, and Darwin, still at Ilkley spa town, began corrections for a second edition. The novelist Charles Kingsley, a Christian socialist country rector, sent him a letter of praise: \\"It awes me...if you be right I must give up much that I have believed\\", it was \\"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which he himself had made.\\" Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \\"a celebrated author and divine\\". First reviews The reviewers were less encouraging. Four days before publication, a review in the authoritative Athenaeum (by John Leifchild, published anonymously, as was the custom at that time) was quick to pick out the unstated implications of \\"men from monkeys\\" already controversial from Vestiges, saw snubs to theologians, summing up Darwin's \\"creed\\" as man \\"was born yesterday – he will perish tomorrow\\" and concluded that \\"The work deserves attention, and will, we have no doubt, meet with it. Scientific naturalists will take up the author upon his own peculiar ground; and there will we imagine be a severe struggle for at least theoretical existence. Theologians will say—and they have a right to be heard—Why construct another elaborate theory to exclude Deity from renewed acts of creation? Why not at once admit that new species were introduced by the Creative energy of the Omnipotent? Why not accept direct interference, rather than evolutions of law, and needlessly indirect or remote action? Having introduced the author and his work, we must leave them to the mercies of the Divinity Hall, the College, the Lecture Room, and the Museum.\\" At Ilkley, Darwin raged \\"But the manner in which he drags in immortality, & sets the Priests at me, & leaves me to their mercies, is base. He would on no account burn me; but he will get the wood ready and tell the black beasts how to catch me.\\" Darwin sprained an ankle and his health worsened, as he wrote to friends it was \\"odious\\". By 9 December when Darwin left Ilkley to come home, he had been told that Murray was organising a second run of 3,000 copies. Hooker had been \\"converted\\", Lyell was \\"absolutely gloating\\" and Huxley wrote \\"with such tremendous praise\\", advising that he was sharpening his \\"beak and claws\\" to disembowel \\"the curs who will bark and yelp\\". =First response= Richard Owen had been the first to respond to the complimentary copies, courteously claiming that he had long believed that \\"existing influences\\" were responsible for the \\"ordained\\" birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that \\"Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter & sneering against me. Yet I infer from several expressions, that at bottom he goes immense way with us.\\" Owen was furious at being included among those defending immutability of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation \\"ever published of the manner of formation of species\\", though he did not agree with it in all respects. He still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialise man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in \\"Creative Power\\". Darwin had already made his views clearer to others, telling Lyell that if each step in evolution was providentially planned, the whole procedure would be a miracle and natural selection superfluous. He had also sent a copy to John Herschel, and on 10 December he told Lyell of having \\"heard by round about channel that Herschel says my Book \\"is the law of higgledy-piggledy\\".– What this exactly means I do not know, but it is evidently very contemptuous.– If true this is great blow & discouragement.\\" Darwin subsequently corresponded with Herschel, and in January 1861 Herschel added a footnote to the draft of his Physical Geography which, while disparaging \\"the principle of arbitrary and casual variation and natural selection\\" as insufficient without \\"intelligent direction\\", said that \\"with some demur as to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view taken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book.\\" =Geological time= It was known that the geologic time scale was \\"incomprehensibly vast\\", if unquantifiable. From 1848 Darwin discussed data with Andrew Ramsay, who had said \\"it is vain to attempt to measure the duration of even small portions of geological epochs.\\" A chapter of Lyell's Principles of Geology described the enormous amount of erosion involved in forming the Weald. To demonstrate the time available for natural selection to operate, Darwin drew on Lyell's example and Ramsay's data in chapter 9 of On the Origin of Species to estimate that erosion of the Weald's layered dome of Lower Cretaceous rocks \\"must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three hundred million years.\\" The \\"necessary corrections\\" Darwin made to his drafts for the second edition of the Origin were based on comments from others, particularly Lyell, and added a caveat suggesting a faster rate of erosion of the Weald: \\"perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three inches per century, and this would reduce the number of years to one hundred and fifty or one hundred million years.\\" Copies of the second edition were advertised as ready on 24 December, in advance of official publication on 7 January 1860. The Saturday Review of 24 December 1859 strongly criticised the methodology of Darwin's calculations.Anon (24 December 1859) [Review of] On the origin of species, Saturday Review, pp. 775–776. On 3 January 1860, Darwin wrote to Hooker about it: \\"Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, & the Reviewer gives me some good & well deserved raps,—confound it I am sorry to confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument.\\" A day later, he said to Lyell \\"You saw I suppose Saturday Review: argument confined to Geology, but has given me some perfectly just & severe raps on knuckles.\\" In the third edition published on 30 April 1861, Darwin cited the Saturday Review article as reason to remove his calculation altogether. =Friendly reviews= The December 1859 review in the British Unitarian National Review was written by Darwin's old friend William Carpenter, who was clear that only a world of \\"order, continuity, and progress\\" befitted an Omnipotent Deity and that \\"any theological objection\\" to a species of slug or a breed of dog deriving from a previous one was \\"simply absurd\\" dogma. He touched on human evolution, satisfied that the struggle for existence tended \\"inevitably... towards the progressive exaltation of the races engaged in it\\". On Boxing Day (26 December) The Times carried an anonymous review. The staff reviewer, \\"as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe\\", gave the task to Huxley, leading Darwin to ask his friend how \\"did you influence Jupiter Olympus and make him give three and a half columns to pure science? The old fogies will think the world will come to an end.\\" Darwin treasured the piece more than \\"a dozen reviews in common periodicals\\", but noted \\"Upon my life I am sorry for Owen... he will be so d—d savage, for credit given to any other man, I strongly suspect, is in his eyes so much credit robbed from him. Science is so narrow a field, it is clear there ought to be only one cock of the walk!\\". Hooker also wrote a favourable review, which appeared at the end of December in the Gardener's Chronicle and treated the theory as an extension of horticultural lore. =Clerical concern, atheist enthusiasm= In his lofty position at the head of Science, Owen received numerous complaints about the book. The Revd. Adam Sedgwick, geologist at the University of Cambridge who had taken Darwin on his first geology field trip, could not see the point in a world without providence. The missionary David Livingstone could see no struggle for existence on the African plains. Jeffries Wyman at Harvard saw no truth in chance variations. The most enthusiastic response came from atheists, with Hewett Watson hailing Darwin as the \\"greatest revolutionist in natural history of this century\\". The 68-year-old Robert Edmund Grant, who had shown him the study of invertebrates when Darwin was a student at the University of Edinburgh and who was still teaching Lamarckian evolution weekly at University College London, brought out a small book on classification dedicated to Darwin: \\"With one fell-sweep of the wand of truth, you have now scattered to the winds the pestilential vapours accumulated by 'species-mongers'.\\" Widespread interest In January 1860, Darwin told Lyell of a reported incident at Waterloo Bridge Station: \\"I never till to day realised that it was getting widely distributed; for in a letter from a lady today to Emma, she says she heard a man enquiring for it at Railway Station!!! at Waterloo Bridge; & the Bookseller said that he had none till new Edit. was out.— The Bookseller said he had not read it but had heard it was a very remarkable book!!!\\" =Asa Gray in the United States= In December 1859 the botanist Asa Gray negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, however, he learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin wrote in January, \\"I never dreamed of my Book being so successful with general readers: I believe I should have laughed at the idea of sending the sheets to America.\\" and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5 per cent royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this was the first printing alone as there were four that year. When sending his Historical preface and corrections for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as \\"a Review from a man, who is not an entire convert, if fair & moderately favourable, is in all respects the best kind of Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder.\\" In April he continued, \\"It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!\\" A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and \\"had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars\\" – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was \\"inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton\\" – referring to Isaac Newton. =Erasmus and Martineau= Darwin's brother Erasmus reported on 23 November that their cousin Henry Holland was reading the book and in \\"a dreadful state of indecision\\", sure that explaining the eye would be \\"utterly impossible\\", but after reading it \\"he hummed & hawed & perhaps it was partly conceivable\\". Erasmus himself thought it \\"the most interesting book I ever read\\", and sent a copy to his old flame Miss Harriet Martineau who, at 58, was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised \\"the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by wh. it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentious knowledge. I shd. much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.\\"Spelling and abbreviations as Writing to her fellow Malthusian (and atheist) George Holyoake she enthused, \\"What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath.\\" To Fanny Wedgwood she wrote, \\"I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of \\"The Creator\\" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the 'Origin of Species' & not the origin of Organisation; & it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all – There now! I have delivered my mind.\\" =Clerical reaction= The Revd. Adam Sedgwick had received his copy \\"with more pain than pleasure.\\" Without Creation showing divine love, \\"humanity, to my mind, would suffer a damage that might brutalise it, and sink the human race...\\" He indicated that unless Darwin accepted God's revelation in nature and scripture, Sedgwick would not meet Darwin in heaven, a sentiment that upset Emma. The Revd. John Stevens Henslow, the botany professor whose natural history course Charles had joined thirty years earlier, gave faint praise to the Origin as \\"a stumble in the right direction\\" but distanced himself from its conclusions, \\"a question past our finding out...\\" The Anglican establishment predominantly opposed Darwin. Palmerston, who became Prime Minister in June 1859, mooted Darwin's name to Queen Victoria as a candidate for the Honours List with the prospect of a knighthood. While Prince Albert supported the idea, after the publication of the Origin Queen Victoria's ecclesiastical advisers, including the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, dissented and the request was denied.. Some Anglicans were more in favour, and Huxley reported of Kingsley that \\"He is an excellent Darwinian to begin with, and told me a capital story of his reply to Lady Aylesbury who expressed astonishment at his favouring such a heresy – 'What can be more delightful to me Lady Aylesbury, than to know that your Ladyship & myself sprang from the same toad stool.' Whereby the frivolous old woman shut up, in doubt whether she was being chaffed or adored for her remark.\\" There was no official comment from the Vatican for several decades, but in 1860 a council of the German Catholic bishops pronounced that the belief that \\"man as regards his body, emerged finally from the spontaneous continuous change of imperfect nature to the more perfect, is clearly opposed to Sacred Scripture and to the Faith.\\" This defined the range of official Catholic discussion of evolution, which has remained almost exclusively concerned with human evolution.Harrison, Brian W., Early Vatican Responses to Evolutionist Theology, Living Tradition, Organ of the Roman Theological Forum, May 2001 – quotation from here. See also: Artigas, Mariano; Glick, Thomas F., Martínez, Rafael A.; Negotiating Darwin: the Vatican confronts evolution, 1877–1902, JHU Press, 2006, , 9780801883897, Google books =Huxley and Owen= The combative Thomas Huxley demanded a fair hearing for Darwin's ideas. On 10 February 1860 Huxley gave a lecture titled On Species and Races, and their Origin at the Royal Institution, reviewing Darwin's theory with fancy pigeons on hand to demonstrate artificial selection, as well as using the occasion to confront the clergy with his aim of wresting science from ecclesiastical control. He referred to Galileo's persecution by the church, \\"the little Canutes of the hour enthroned in solemn state, bidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to check its beneficent progress.\\" He hailed the Origin as heralding a \\"new Reformation\\" in a battle against \\"those who would silence and crush\\" science, and called on the public to cherish Science and \\"follow her methods faithfully and implicitly in their application to all branches of human thought,\\" for the future of England. To Darwin such rhetoric was \\"time wasted\\" and on reflection he thought the lecture \\"an entire failure which gave no just idea of natural selection,\\" but by March he was listing those on \\"our side\\" as against the \\"outsiders.\\" His close allies were Hooker and Huxley, and in August he called Huxley his \\"good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel – i.e. the devil's gospel.\\" The position of Richard Owen was unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee the need for a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that \\"The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them...\\" As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely there ought to be a space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?\\" Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwins ideas to humans. This showed humans and apes had a common ancestor. Huxley's April review in the Westminster Review included the first mention of the term \\"Darwinism\\" in the question, \\"What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?\\" Darwin thought it a \\"brilliant review.\\" > Overflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles, the \\"species > question\\" divides with Italy and the Volunteers the attention of general > society. Everybody has read Mr. Darwin's book, or, at least, has given an > opinion upon its merits or demerits; pietists, whether lay or ecclesiastic, > decry it with the mild railing which sounds so charitable; bigots denounce > it with ignorant invective; old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly > dangerous book, and even savants, who have no better mud to throw, quote > antiquated writers to show that its author is no better than an ape himself; > while every philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable Whitworth gun in > the armoury of liberalism; and all competent naturalists and physiologists, > whatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines put forth, > acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solid contribution > to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in natural history. – Thomas > Huxley, 1860 When Owen's own anonymous review of the Origin appeared in the April Edinburgh Review he praised himself and his own axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things, and showed his anger at what he saw as Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre- eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's \\"disciples\\" Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of \\"abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation.\\" Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was \\"extremely malignant, clever & I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, & very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts. .... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me.\\" He commented to Henslow that \\"Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents & alters what I say very unfairly. .... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what a strange man to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!\\" =Geological time and Phillips= Darwin's had estimated that erosion of the Weald would take 300 million years, but in the second edition of On the Origin of Species published on 7 January 1860 he accepted that it would be safer to allow 150 million to 200 million years. Geologists knew the earth was ancient, but had felt unable to put realistic figures on the duration of past geological changes. Darwin's book provided a new impetus to quantifying geological time. His most prominent critic, John Phillips, had investigated how temperatures increased with depth in the 1830s, and was convinced that, contrary to Lyell and Darwin's uniformitarianism, the Earth was cooling over the long term. Between 1838 and 1855 he tried various ways of quantifying the timing of stratified deposits, without success. On 17 February 1860, Phillips used his presidential address to the Geological Society of London to accuse Darwin of \\"abuse of arithmetic\\". He said 300 million years was an \\"inconceivable number\\" and that, depending on assumptions, erosion of the Weald could have taken anything from 12,000 years to at most 1,332,000 years, well below Darwin's estimate. When giving the May 1860 Rede Lecture, Phillips produced his own first published estimates of the duration of the whole stratigraphic record, using rates of sedimentation to calculate it at around 96 million years. =Natural persecution= Most reviewers wrote with great respect, deferring to Darwin's eminent position in science though finding it hard to understand how natural selection could work without a divine selector. There were hostile comments, at the start of May he commented to Lyell that he had \\"received in a Manchester Newspaper a rather a good squib, showing that I have proved 'might is right', & therefore that Napoleon is right & every cheating Tradesman is also right\\". The Saturday Review reported that \\"The controversy excited by the appearance of Darwin's remarkable work on the Origin of Species has passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street.\\"Anon (5 May 1860), \\"Professor Owen on the Origin of Species\\", The Saturday Review, London, p. 579. The older generation of Darwin's tutors were rather negative, and later in May he told his cousin Fox that \\"the attacks have been falling thick & heavy on my now case-hardened hide.— Sedgwick & Clarke opened regular battery on me lately at Cambridge Phil. Socy. & dear old Henslow defended me in grand style, saying that my investigations were perfectly legitimate.\\" While defending Darwin's honest motives and belief that \\"he was exalting & not debasing our views of a Creator, in attributing to him a power of imposing laws on the Organic World by which to do his work, as effectually as his laws imposed upon the inorganic had done it in the Mineral Kingdom\\", Henslow had not disguised his own opinion that \\"Darwin has pressed his hypothesis too far\\". In June, Karl Marx saw the book as a \\"bitter satire\\" that showed \\"a basis in natural science for class struggle in history\\", in which \\"Darwin recognizes among beasts and plants his English society\\".Letter from Karl Marx to Engels dated 18 June 1862 cited in . Darwin remarked to Lyell, \\"I must be a very bad explainer... Several Reviews, & several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose natural selection was bad term; but to change it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; Natural preservation would not imply a preservation of particular varieties & would seem a truism; & would not bring man's & nature's selection under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer.\\" It was too illegible for Lyell, and Darwin later apologised \\"I am utterly ashamed & groan over my hand-writing. It was Natural Preservation. Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer.\\" DebateEssays and Reviews= Around February 1860 liberal theologians entered the fray, when seven produced a manifesto titled Essays and Reviews. These Anglicans included Oxford professors, country clergymen, the headmaster of Rugby school and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Darwin. Essays sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the Origin sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues. The most scientific of the seven was the Reverend Baden Powell, who held the Savilian chair of geometry at the University of Oxford. Referring to \\"Mr Darwin's masterly volume\\" and restating his argument that God is a lawgiver, miracles break the lawful edicts issued at Creation, therefore belief in miracles is atheistic, he wrote that the book \\"must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.\\" He drew attacks, with Sedgwick accusing him of \\"greedily\\" adopting nonsense and Tory reviews saying he was joining \\"the infidel party\\". He would have been on the platform at the British Association debate, facing the bishop, but died of a heart attack on 11 June. =The British Association debate= The most famous confrontation took place at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine \\"Botany and Zoology\\" meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the Vestiges published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the Origin for the Tory Quarterly for a fee of £60. Huxley was not going to wait for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of \\"deserting them\\" and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new hydropathic establishment at Sudbrooke Park, Petersham, near Richmond in Surrey. The debate was held in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History From Hooker's account, Draper \\"droned on for an hour\\", then for half an hour \\"Soapy Sam\\" Wilberforce replied with the eloquence that had earned him his nickname. This time the climate of opinion had changed and the ensuing debate was more evenly matched, with Hooker being particularly successful in defence of Darwin's ideas. In response to what Huxley took as a jibe from Wilberforce as to whether it was on Huxley's grandfather's or grandmother's side that he was descended from an ape, Huxley made a reply which he later recalled as being that \\"[if asked] would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means and influence and yet who employs these faculties and that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape\\". No verbatim record was taken: eyewitness accounts exist, and vary somewhat.Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton] Robert FitzRoy, who had been the captain of during Darwin's voyage, was there to present a paper on storms. During the debate FitzRoy, seen by Hooker as \\"a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman\\", stood in the centre of the audience and \\"lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man\\". As he admitted that the Origin of Species had given him \\"acutest pain\\" the crowd shouted him down. Hooker's \\"blood boiled, I felt myself a dastard; now I saw my advantage–I swore to myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh\\", (he was invited up to the platform and) \\"there and then I smacked him amid rounds of applause... proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... wound up with a very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses... Sam was shut up... and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you [Darwin] master of the field after 4 hours battle.\\" Both sides came away claiming victory, with Hooker and Huxley each sending Darwin rather contradictory triumphant accounts. Supporters of Darwinism seized on this meeting as a sign that the idea of evolution could not be suppressed by authority, and would be defended vigorously by its advocates. Liberal clerics were also satisfied that literal belief in all aspects of the Bible was now questioned by science; they were sympathetic to some of the ideas in Essays and Reviews.Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science. U. of Delaware Press, Newark.See also: Alfred Newton#Reception of the Origin of Species and Thomas Henry Huxley#Debate with Wilberforce William Whewell wrote to his friend James David Forbes that \\"Perhaps the Bishop was not prudent to venture into a field where no eloquence can supersede the need for precise knowledge. The young naturalists declared themselves in favour of Darwin’s views which tendency I saw already at Leeds two years ago. I am sorry for it, for I reckon Darwin’s book to be an utterly unphilosophical one.\\", William Whewell Quotes - 38 Science Quotes - Dictionary of Science Quotations and Scientist Quotes, Letter to James D, Forbes (24 Jul 1860) Wilberforce. His hand washing gesture helped earn the Bishop of Oxford his nickname =Wilberforce's Quarterly review= In late July Darwin read Wilberforce's review in the Quarterly. It used a 60-year-old parody from the Anti-Jacobin of the prose of Darwin's grandfather Erasmus, implying old revolutionary sympathies. It argued that if \\"transmutations were actually occurring\\" this would be seen in rapidly reproducing invertebrates, and since it isn't, why think that \\"the favourite varieties of turnips are tending to become men\\". Darwin pencilled \\"rubbish\\" in the margin. To the statement about classification that \\"all creation is the transcript in matter of ideas eternally existing in the mind of the Most High!!\\", Darwin scribbled \\"mere words\\". At the same time, Darwin was willing to grant that Wilberforce's review was clever: he wrote to Hooker that \\"it picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the 'Anti-Jacobin' against my Grandfather.\\" Wilberforce also attacked Essays and Reviews in the Quarterly Review, and in a letter to The Times, signed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and 25 bishops, which threatened the theologians with the ecclesiastical courts. Darwin quoted a proverb: \\"A bench of bishops is the devil's flower garden\\", and joined others including Lyell, though not Hooker and Huxley, in signing a counter-letter supporting Essays and Reviews for trying to \\"establish religious teachings on a firmer and broader foundation\\". Despite this alignment of pro-evolution scientists and Unitarians with liberal churchmen, two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862. =Geological time, Phillips and third edition= In October 1860, John Phillips published Life on the Earth, its origin and succession, reiterating points from his Rede Lecture and disputing Darwin's arguments. He sent a copy to Darwin, who thanked him, though \\"sorry, but not surprised, to see that you are dead against me\\". On 20 November, Darwin told Lyell of his revisions for a third edition of the Origin, including removing his estimate of the time it took for the Weald to erode: \\"The confounded Wealden calculation, to be struck out. & a note to be inserted to effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from Review in Saturday R. & from Phillips, as I see in Table of Contents that he attacks it.\\" He later told Lyell that \\"Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you\\", and advised caution: \\"for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant.\\" The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated \\"The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted. I have been convinced of its inaccuracy in several respects by an excellent article in the 'Saturday Review,' Dec. 24, 1859.\\" =Natural History Review= The Natural History Review was bought and refurbished by Huxley, Lubbock, Busk and other \\"plastically minded young men\\" – supporters of Darwin. The first issue in January 1861 carried Huxley's paper on man's relationship to apes, \\"showing up\\" Owen. Huxley cheekily sent a copy to Wilberforce. Darwin at home As the battles raged, Darwin returned home from the spa to proceed with experiments on chloroforming carnivorous sundew plants, looking over his Natural Selection manuscript and drafting two chapters on pigeon breeding that would eventually form part of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. He wrote to Asa Gray and used the example of fantail pigeons to argue against Gray's belief \\"that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines\\", with the implication of Creationism rather than Natural Selection. Over the winter he organised a third edition of the Origin, adding an introductory historical sketch. Asa Gray had published three supportive articles in the Atlantic Monthly. Darwin persuaded Gray to publish them as a pamphlet, and was delighted when Gray came up with the title of Natural Selection Not Inconsistent with Natural Theology. Darwin paid half the cost, imported 250 copies into Britain and as well as advertising it in periodicals and sending 100 copies out to scientists, reviewers, and theologians (including Wilberforce), he included in the Origin a recommendation for it, available to be purchased for 1s. 6d. from Trübner's in Paternoster Row. The Huxleys became close family friends, frequently visiting Down House. When their 3-year-old son died of scarlet fever they were badly affected. Henrietta Huxley brought their three infants to Down in March 1861 where Emma helped to console her, while Huxley continued with his working-men's lectures at the Royal School of Mines, writing that \\"My working men stick with me wonderfully, the house fuller than ever, By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys.\\". Page 190 in the first edition. =Arguments with Owen= Huxley's arguments with Owen continued in the Athenaeum so that each Saturday Darwin could read the latest ripostes. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an \\"advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape\\", and one of his contributions was titled \\"Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain\\". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on \\"pithecoid man\\" – ape-like man, and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. He was determined to indict Owen for perjury, promising \\"before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers.\\" Darwin egged him on from Down, writing \\"Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side\\". Their campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful, with each \\"slaying\\" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. When Huxley joined the Zoological Society Council in 1861, Owen left, and in the following year Huxley moved to stop Owen from being elected to the Royal Society Council as \\"no body of gentlemen\\" should admit a member \\"guilty of wilful & deliberate falsehood.\\" Lyell was troubled both by Huxley's belligerence and by the question of ape ancestry, but got little sympathy from Darwin who teased him that \\"Our ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim bladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull, and undoubtedly was a hermaphrodite! Here is a pleasant genealogy for mankind.\\" Lyell began work on a book examining human origins. =Geological time: William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)= Like the geologist John Phillips, the physicist William Thomson (later ennobled as Lord Kelvin) had considered since the 1840s that the physics of thermodynamics required that the Earth was cooling from an initial molten state. This contradicted Lyell's uniformitarian concept of unchanging processes over deep geological time, which Darwin shared and had assumed would allow ample time for the slow process of natural selection. In June 1861 Thomson asked Phillips how geologists felt about Darwin's \\"prodigious durations for geological epochs\\". and mentioned his own preliminary calculation that the Sun was 20 million years old, with the Earth at most 200 to 1,000 million years old. Phillips discussed his own published view that stratified rocks went back 96 million years, and dismissed Darwin's original estimate that the Weald had taken 300 million years to erode. In September 1861 Thomson produced a paper \\"On the age of the Sun's heat\\" which estimated that the Sun was between 100 and 500 million years old, and in 1862 he used assumptions on the rate of cooling from a molten condition to estimate the age of the Earth at 98 million years. The dispute continued for the rest of Darwin's life.Thomson, William. (1864). \\"On the secular cooling of the earth\\", read 28 April 1862. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 23, 157–170. Continued debate A French caricature around 1878 shows a bearded Darwin breaking through hoops of \\"gullibility, superstitions, errors, and ignorance\\" held up by Émile Littré. The reception of Darwin's ideas continued to arouse scientific and religious debates, and wide public interest. Satirical cartoonists seized on animal ancestry in relation to other topical issues, drawing on a long tradition of identifying animal traits in humans. In Britain mass circulation magazines were droll rather than cruel, and thus presented Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. Due to illness, Darwin began growing a beard in 1862, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 with a bushy beard, caricatures centred on Darwin and his new look contributed to a trend in which all forms of evolutionism were identified with Darwinism.

Historically, the term \\"Appalachian dialect\\" refers to a local English variety of southern Appalachia, also known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English in the United States, both influential upon and influenced by the Southern U.S. regional dialect, which has become predominant in central and southern Appalachia today, while a Western Pennsylvania regional dialect has become predominant in northern Appalachia. The 2006 Atlas of North American English identifies the \\"Inland South,” a dialect sub-region in which the Southern U.S. dialect's defining vowel shift is the most developed, as centering squarely in southern Appalachia: namely, the cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; and Asheville, North Carolina. All Appalachian English is rhotic and characterized by distinct phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. It is mostly oral but its features are also sometimes represented in literary works. Extensive research has been conducted since the 1930s to determine the origin of the Appalachian dialect. One popular theory is that the dialect is a preserved remnant of 16th-century (or \\"Elizabethan\\") English in isolation,Cooper, Horton. \\"History of Avery County\\", Biltmore Press, (1964) though a far more accurate comparison would be to 18th-century (or \\"colonial\\") English. Regardless, the Appalachian dialect studied within the last century, like most dialects, actually shows a mix of both older and newer features. Appalachian English has long been criticized both within and outside of the speaking area as an inferior dialect, which is often mistakenly attributed to supposed laziness, lack of education, or the region's relative isolation. American writers throughout the 20th century have used the dialect as the chosen speech of uneducated and unsophisticated characters, though research has largely disproven these stereotypes; however, due to prejudice, the use of the Appalachian dialect is still often an impediment to educational and social advancement. Along with these pejorative associations, there has been much debate as to whether Appalachian English is an actual dialect. Many researchers believe that it is more a part of the Southern dialect region as it shares many components with it. Others believe that it is its own dialect with results coming from differing lexical variables. Appalachian English does include many similar grammatical components as the Midland dialect. PhonologyPhonetics= * The Southern Shift and Southern Drawl: A vowel shift known as the Southern Shift, which largely defines the speech of most of the Southern United States, is the most developed both in Texas English and here in Appalachian English (located in a dialect region which The Atlas of North American English identifies as the \\"Inland South\\"). This involves several unique vowel changes, in three complex stages: ** Stage 1: In the diphthong , the second half of the diphthong is often omitted (referred to as monophthongization), and it is thus pronounced similar to . (Thus, for example, the word tide in this dialect may sound to outsiders more like Todd or even tad). In extreme instances, words such as \\"wire,\\" \\"fire,\\" \\"tire,\\" and \\"hired\\" are pronounced so as to sound completely identical to the words \\"war,\\" \\"far,\\" \\"tar,\\" and \\"hard\\" respectively.Kirk Hazen, \\"African-American Appalachian English.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1006. ** Stage 2: The diphthong begins further back and open in the mouth, so that, for example, fish bait and old lace in this dialect may sound to other English speakers more like fish bite and old lice. The vowel then moves in the opposite direction and acquires a \\"drawl\\" or longer, glide-like sound quality, so that red may be said to sound more like ray-ud or rih-yud. Stage 2 is most common in heavily stressed syllables. **Stage 3: The vowel is pronounced higher in the mouth and with a drawl, so that hit may be said to sound like hee-it. Conversely, the vowel lowers and then glides up again, so that feet may sound more like fih-eet or fuh-eet. Stage 3 is most common in heavily stressed syllables. * Lax and tense vowels often neutralize before , making pairs like feel/fill and fail/fell homophones for speakers in some areas. Some speakers may distinguish between the two sets of words by reversing the normal vowel sound, e.g., feel may sound like fill, and vice versa. * Short \\"i\\" and short \\"e\\" have the same pronunciation when appearing before \\"n\\" or \\"m\\" (e.g., \\"pen\\" and \\"pin\\" are both pronounced \\"pin\\"). Adjectives are often used to distinguish between the two (e.g., \\"ink pen\\", \\"sewing pin\\"). =Phonemic incidence= Research suggests that the Appalachian dialect is one of the most distinctive and divergent dialects within the United States. * An epenthetic occurs in some words such as wash, leading to the pronunciation . * An \\"-er\\" sound is often used for long \\"o\\" at the end of a word. For example, hollow-- \\"a small, sheltered valley\\"-- is pronounced , homophonous with holler.Bridget Anderson, \\"Appalachian English in the Urban North.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1011. Other examples are \\"potato\\" (pronounced \\"tader\\"), \\"tomato\\" (pronounced \\"mader\\"), and \\"tobacco\\" (pronounced \\"backer\\"). * H retention occurs at the beginning of certain words. It, in particular, is pronounced hit at the beginning of a sentence and also when emphasized. The word \\"ain't\\" is pronounced hain't. * Participles and gerunds such as doing and mining end in instead of . While this occurs to some extent in all dialects of American English, it possibly occurs with greater frequency in Southern Appalachia. * Word final a is sometimes pronounced , as in okra (). * Intervocalic s in greasy is pronounced , as in other Southern American and some British speech. A related matter: The noun \\"grease\\" is pronounced with an \\"s,\\" but this consonant turns into a \\"z\\" in the adjective and in the verb \\"to grease.\\" * People who live in the Appalachian dialect area or elsewhere in the South pronounce the word Appalachia with a short \\"a\\" sound (as in \\"latch\\") in the third syllable, or , while those who live outside of the Appalachian dialect area or at its outer edges tend to pronounce it with a long \\"a\\" sound (as in \\"lay\\"), .David Walls, \\"Appalachia.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1006-1007. GrammarConjugation of the verb \\"to be\\"= The conjugation of the verb \\"to be\\" is different from that of standard English in several ways, and sometimes more than one form of the verb \\"to be\\" is acceptable in Appalachian English. Divergence from standard English conjugation of the verb \\"to be\\" occurs with the highest frequency in the past tense, where grammatically plural subjects also take the singular form \\"was\\" rather than \\"were\\". Thus, the paradigm of the verb \\"to be\\" in Appalachian English more closely resembles the paradigm for other non-\\"be\\" verbs in English, where the past tense takes a single form, regardless of number or person. The use of the word ain't is also one of the most salient features of this dialect. While \\"ain't\\" is used to some extent in most American English dialects, it is used with much greater frequency in the Appalachian dialect. Similarly, the phrase \\"it is\\" frequently appeared as \\"it are\\" in Appalachian English as late as the mid-twentieth century. =Conjugation among other verb types= While the greatest amount of divergence in subject-verb concord occurs in the past tense of the verb 'to be', certain types of plural subjects have an effect on concord across various types of verbs. However, plural subjects continue to show the greatest frequency of non-concord. The example below is taken from : Conjoined noun phrases: * \\"Me and my sister gets into a fight sometimes.\\" *\\"A boy and his daddy was a-huntin'.\\" Collective noun phrases: *\\"Some people makes it from fat off a pig.\\" *\\"People's not concerned.\\" Other plural noun phrases: *\\"...no matter what their parents has taught 'em.\\" *\\"The cars was all tore up.\\" Expletive 'there': *\\"There's different breeds of 'em.\\" *\\"There was 5 in our family.\\" =A-verb-ing (a-prefixing)= A notable feature of Appalachian English is the a-prefix which occurs with participle forms ending in -ing. This prefix is pronounced as a schwa . The a-prefix most commonly occurs with progressives, in both past and non-past tenses. For example, \\"My cousin had a little pony and we was a-ridin' it one day\\" Common contexts also include where the participle form functions as an adverbial complement, such as after movement verbs (come, go, take off) and with verbs of continuing or starting (keep, start, get to). Examples include \\"All of a sudden a bear come a-runnin'\\", and \\"He just kep' a-beggin'\\". Phonological rules and restrictions apply to a-prefixing; for example, it can only occur with verbs accented on the initial syllable: a-fóllowin but not a-discóverin or a-retírin.Wolfram, Walt, and Natalie Schilling-Estes. American English: Dialects and Variation. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008. Moreover, it cannot occur on –ing forms functioning as nouns or adjectives; the forms must function as verbs. Thus, sentences like the movie was a-charmin are ungrammatical. 'A' can only be a prefix of verbs or complements of verbs with –ing. However, the a-prefix may not be attached to a verb which begins with an unstressed syllable, such as discover or retire. While much less frequent or productive, the a-prefix can also occur on participles ending in -ed, such as \\"a-haunted\\" The a-prefix has been found to occur most frequently in more animated or vivid narratives, as a stylistic device. Studies suggest that a-prefixing is more common with older speakers and might therefore disappear completely in a few years.Frazer, Timothy C. \\"More on the Semantics of A-Prefixing.\\" American Speech, 65.1 (1990): 89-93. Because of the considerable difference of a-prefixing frequency according to age (the frequency varied between 10% and 50%), Walt Wolfram (1976) supports the \\"(...) contention that a-prefixing is a phenomenon that is dying out in Appalachia\\". A-prefixing can be traced back to the 16th century: The construction reached its height from 1500-1700 and developed out of using the preposition \\"on\\" and a verbal noun ending in -ing. Only used in formal and educated writing in the 17th century, it became nonstandard in the 18th century. Montgomery (2009) argues that a-prefixing developed from the preposition \\"an\\"/\\"on\\" in Early Middle English and suggests that it arose from the loss of the -n from \\"on\\" in examples like \\"hee set before his eyes king Henrie the eight with all his Lordes on hunting in his forrest at Windsore\\" (Thomas Nashe, \\"Unfortunate Traveller,\\" 1594). =Other verb forms= *Sometimes the past participle of a strong verb such as \\"do\\" is used in place of the past tense. For example, \\"I done it already\\" instead of \\"I did it already\\" or in the case of the verb \\"see,\\" \\"I seen\\" instead of \\"I saw.\\" \\"Went\\" is often used instead of \\"gone\\" as the past participle of the verb \\"to go.\\" She had went to Ashland. Less frequently, \\"gone\\" is used as the simple past tense. I gone down to the meeting, but wasn't nobody there. \\"Done\\" is used with the past tense (or a past participle commonly used as a past tense, such as \\"gone\\") to express action just completed, as in, \\"I done went/gone to the store\\". *Some English strong verbs are occasionally conjugated as weak verbs in Appalachian English, e.g. \\"knowed,\\" and \\"seed.\\" *The construction \\"don't...no\\" is used with transitive verbs to indicate the negative, e.g. \\"He don't know no better.\\" This is commonly referred to as the double negative, and is either negative or emphatically negative, never positive. \\"None\\" is often used in place of \\"any,\\" as in \\"I don't have none.\\" *Verb forms for the verb \\"to lay\\" are used instead of forms of the verb \\"to lie.\\" For example, \\"Lay down and hush.\\" *\\"Might could\\" is sometimes used where a speaker of standard English would say, \\"might be able to\\" or \\"could maybe.\\" *Measurements such as \\"foot\\" and \\"mile\\" often retain their singular form even when used in the plural sense. For example, \\"That stick is 3 foot long\\", or \\"We need 6 foot of drywall\\". \\"Foot\\" in the singular is standard in UK English. =Double nouns= Some nouns are spoken in pairs, the first noun describing the seemingly redundant second noun, as in \\"hound dog\\", \\"Cadillac car\\", \\"widow woman\\", \\"toad frog\\", \\"biscuit bread\\", or \\"rifle gun\\".Edward Everett Dale, \\"The Speech of the Pioneers\\", The Arkansas Historical Quarterly, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Summer, 1947), pp. 117-131 =Pronouns and demonstratives= \\"Them\\" is sometimes used in place of \\"those\\" as a demonstrative in both nominative and oblique constructions. Examples are \\"Them are the pants I want\\" and \\"Give me some of them crackers.\\" Oblique forms of the personal pronouns are used as nominative when more than one is used (cf. French moi et toi). For example, \\"Me and him are real good friends\\" instead of \\"He and I are really good friends.\\" Accusative case personal pronouns are used as reflexives in situations which, in American English, do not typically demand them (e.g., \\"I'm gonna get me a haircut\\"). The -self/-selves forms are used almost exclusively as emphatics, and then often in non-standard forms (e.g., \\"the preacher hisself\\"). Second person pronouns are often retained as subjects in imperative sentences (e.g., \\"You go an' get you a cookie\\"). =Other grammatical forms='Liketa' In Appalachian English, the form 'liketa' functions as an adverb and occurs before the past form of a verb. 'Liketa' carries a meaning similar to \\"on the verge of\\" or \\"came so close that I really thought x would\\", where x is the subject of the verb. *\\"I liketa never went to sleep last night.\\" *\\"And I knew what I'd done and boy it liketa scared me to death.\\" 'Liketa' also imposes a notion of impossibility on the clause in which it appears, distinguishing it from the word 'almost'. For example, \\"They almost made it to the top of the mountain\\" is allowed but not \\"They liketa made it to the top of the mountain.\\" 'Liketa' does not carry the same notion of partial truth as 'almost'. Other *Pronouns and adjectives are sometimes combined with \\"'un\\" (meaning \\"one\\"), such as \\"young'un\\" to mean \\"child,\\" \\"big'un\\" to mean \\"big one,\\" and \\"you'uns\\" to mean \\"you all.\\" \\"Young'n'\\" and \\"'big'n'\\" also are common in vernacular northern British English. *The word element \\"-ever\\" is sometimes reversed in words such as \\"whatever\\" (\\"everwhat\\"), \\"whoever\\" (\\"everwho\\"), and \\"however\\" (\\"everhow\\"), but the usage remains the same (e.g., \\"Everwho did this is in big trouble\\"). *The word right can be used with adjectives (e.g., \\"a right cold morning\\") and along with its standard use with adverbs, can also be used with adverbs of manner and time (e.g., \\"right loud\\" or \\"right often\\"). That is an acceptable formation in some areas of British English. Vocabulary Being part of the greater Southern United States, the dialect shares many of the same terms of the South. In its relation to south of the Midland, it has several terms in common with its North Midland counterpart, including poke (paper bag), hull (to shell), and blinds (shutters). Certain German-derived words such as smearcase (cottage cheese), however, are present in the North Midland dialect but absent in the Appalachian dialect. The following is a list of words which occur in the Appalachian dialect. These words are not exclusive to the region, but tend to occur with greater frequency than in other English dialects: * afeared — afraid * airish — cool, chilly * ary/ary'ne — any * bald — a treeless mountain summit (see Appalachian balds) * ball-hoot — to drive recklessly fast on dangerous rural or mountain roads; derived from an old logging term for rolling or skidding logs downhillHarold Farwell, \\"Logging Terminology.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1021. * blinds — window shades or window shutters. While blinds usually refers to window shades, in Appalachia and the greater Midland dialect, it can also refer to window shutters. * blinked — sour, rotten * boomer — a small red squirrel * brickle — brittle * buggy — shopping cart * caps — popcorn * cat-head — a large biscuitSusan Brown, \\"Biscuits and Salt-Rising Bread.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 917. * britches - pants; a derivation of the proper word \\"breeches\\"\\"Oxford Dictionary\\" (U.S. Edition 2018) * chancy — doubtful * chaw — a wad of chewing tobacco * clean — a verb modifier which is used to mean entirely completing an action; can be used in place of 'all the way'; e.g., \\"He knocked it clean off the table.\\" * coke — short for Coca-Cola, but applied to all flavored, carbonated sodas, regardless of brand, flavor or type. Coke is used primarily in the southern half of the dialect region, whereas pop receives more usage in southern Ohio, Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and most of Southwest Virginia. * Co'-cola — colloquial term for Coca-Cola, but used in the same sense as coke above. * cornpone — skillet cornbread made without eggs * counterpane — bedspread * cove — a valley between two ridges * discomfit — to inconvenience * directly — later, after a while; when it becomes convenient, soon, immediately (largely depending on context) * dope — soda * fireboard — mantel * fit — used in replacement of 'fought' * fixin — **a serving or helping of food; e.g., \\"Can I get a fixin' of fritters?\\" **an event, party or social function where food is served; e.g., \\"They're having a fixin' in the hall next Friday.\\" **about to; e.g., \\"They're fixin' to get hitched.\\" * flannel cake — pancake * gaum — mess; used as a noun and a transitive verb; e.g., 'to gaum up' (to mess up).Described as \\"Upper Southern U.S.\\" in The American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed.), which suggests it is related to words such as \\"grease,\\" but it is used more broadly, as in \\"The children made a big gaum, th'owin papers and books all over the place\\" or \\"They really gaumed the room up.\\" See: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gaum In The Melungeons: Resurrection of a Proud People (Mercer University Press, 1997). * haint — used in the context of 'ghost, spirit', and not the derivation of ain't. * holler — hollow, as in a valley between two hills; e.g., \\"I continue to travel between hollers and cities.\\"Shelby Lee Adams, \\"Of Kentucky,\\" New York Times (Sunday Review), November 13, 2011, p. 9. * hull — to shell, as in to shell beans * ill — bad-tempered * jacket — a vest * jarfly — cicadaMichael Ellis, \\"Appalachian English and Ozark English.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1007. * jasper — acquaintance * kyarn — carrion; dead flesh, such as roadkill; e.g., \\"That smells like kyarn.\\" * kindly — kind of, sort of; e.g., \\"Just kindly give it a little twist when you throw.\\" * lamp oil/coal oil — kerosene * lay out — to be truant; e.g., 'to lay out of school', 'to lay out of work' * meeting — a gathering of people for religious purposes * nary/nary'ne — none * palings — fence posts * peckerwood — a disliked person * piece — distance; e.g., \\"He'd have went up the road a piece to get on the main road.\\"; also refers to a snack * plum/plumb — completely; e.g., \\"Son, you're plum crazy.\\" * poke — a brown paper bag * poke sallet/salat/salit (etc.) — a type of salad made from boiled greens (usually pokeweed)Kenneth Gilbert, \\"Greens.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 935. * pokestock/polkstalk — a single shot shotgun; historically a rifle with an unusually long barrel popular with Kentucky frontiersmenHarry Caudill, Night Comes to the Cumberlands (Boston: Little, Brown, 1963). * pop — see coke above * quare — queer, strange, odd; completely unrelated to sexuality; e.g., \\"He's shore a quare 'un.\\" * reckon — to suppose; e.g., \\"I reckon you don't like soup beans.\\" * right smart — good deal of; e.g., 'a right smart piece' (a long way)Example quoted from Robert Parke, \\"Our Southern Highlanders,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 3, no. 4 (September 1977), p. 8. * scald — poor land, bad land * sigogglin — not built correctly, crooked, out of balance * skift — a dusting of snow * slap — full, complete; e.g., \\"A fall in the river, which went slap-right and straight down.\\"Davy Crockett, James Shackford, et al.

The tendency of Appalachian speakers to retain many aspects of their dialect for a generation or more after moving to large urban areas in the north and west suggests that Appalachian English is conservative rather than isolated. Beliefs about Appalachia's isolation led to the early suggestion that the dialect was a surviving relic of long-forgotten forms of English. The most enduring of these early theories suggested that the Appalachian dialect was a remnant of Elizabethan English, a theory popularized by Berea College president William Goddell Frost in the late 1800s. However, while Shakespearean words occasionally appear in Appalachian speech (e.g., afeared), these occurrences are rare. Examples of archaic phrases include the use of might could for might be able to, the use of \\"'un\\" with pronouns and adjectives (e.g., young'un), the use of \\"done\\" as a helping verb (e.g., we done finished it), and the use of words such as airish, brickle, swan, and bottom land all of which were common in Southern and Central England in 17th and 18th centuries.Montgomery, Michael, and Joseph S. Hall. Dictionary of Smoky Mountain English. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2004. The use of double negatives wasn't uncommon in England during the 17th and 18th centuries. Similarly the use of \\"it are\\" in place of \\"it is\\" was common among the rural population of Southern England and the English region of the Midlands in the 1500s, 1600s and 1700s was correspondingly common amongst British colonists, in particular English colonists in the original thirteen colonies, usually pronounced as \\"it err\\". The phrase fell out of use in England sometime in the early 1800s, however it remained in use in the Appalachia region of North America until the mid-to- late twentieth century.Appalachian Speech by Walt Wolfram, Donna Christian, Center for Applied Linguistics Center for Applied Linguistics, 1976. Pg. 114, 120 Similarly, the use of the \\"a-\\" prefix (e.g., \\"a-goin'\\" for \\"going\\") and the attachment of \\"-ed\\" to certain verbs (e.g., knowed), originated in South England. Some speech habits which can be traced back to the rural areas of Southern and Central England include the h-retention (e.g., hit for it), the use of the word right in the place of rather (e.g., right cold), and the presence of words such as yonder. Similarly the word \\"afeared\\" was common in Southern England and the Midlands throughout the 1500s, 1600s and 1700s, though fell out of use in the early 1800s when it was supplanted in literary English after 1700 by the word \\"afraid\\". The word was used frequently in the work of Shakespeare. In Appalachia the word simply remained in use and did not get completely supplanted by the word \\"afraid,\\" unlike in most of the English- speaking world. Though the word \\"afeared\\" originates in Southern England and throughought the region of England known as the Midlands it is nonetheless incorrect to refer to the word \\"afeared\\" as \\"Elizabethan\\" because it was commonly used in England long after the Elizabethan era (including throughout the 1600s).Mountain Speech in the Great Smokies, United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1941, pg. 10 In many older works of literature set in southern England, rural or poor characters demonstrate many of these speech habits. For example, in A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, the speech of the character Jerry Cruncher is distinguished by the frequent use of double negatives and the a- prefix, among other characteristics today associated with areas such as Appalachia. Some pronunciation features reminiscent of those in lowland Scotland and Ulster can also be heard, such as the pin-pen merger and goose fronting, but on the whole it seems that most of the Scotch-Irish influence on the dialect can be found in vocabulary. While the Scotch-Irish and English settlers had a strong influence on the Appalachian dialect, linguistic analyses suggest that Appalachian English developed as a distinctive dialect among English-speaking people in North America. The Appalachian dialect retains a number of speech patterns found in Colonial American English but largely discarded in Standard speech, such as \\"r\\" intrusion (e.g., \\"warsh\\" for \\"wash\\") and a \\"y\\" sound in place of \\"a\\" on the end of certain words (e.g., \\"okry\\" for \\"okra\\"). The southern drawl is of an unknown American origin. Much of Appalachian English has developed independently in the Appalachian region of North America, and is not a remnant of speech derived from the British Isles, but most of what can be traced to Europe does not in fact have its origins in Scotland, Ireland or Northern England. In fact, the majority of the linguistic anachronisms found in the can be traced back to West Country, Southern England and East Anglia.Talking Appalachian: Voice, Identity, and Community edited by Amy D. Clark, Nancy M. HaywardThe Americas and the Caribbean edited by Edgar W. Schneider pg. 429 Native American influences in the Appalachian dialect are virtually nonexistent except for place names (e.g., \\"Appalachia\\", \\"Tennessee\\", \\"Chattahoochee River\\", \\"Cheoah Mountains\\"). While early settlers adopted numerous customs from tribes such as the Cherokee and Shawnee, they typically applied existing words from their own languages to those customs. Relation to the Ozarks The traditional Appalachian dialect spread to the Ozark Mountains in northwestern Arkansas and southwestern Missouri. Ozark and Appalachian English have been documented together as a single Southern Mountain dialect of the United States. Appalachian terms found in Ozark English include fireboard, tow sack, jarfly, and brickle and similar speech patterns also exist, such as epenthetic h (hit instead of it), the use of the \\"-a\\" prefix (\\"a-goin'\\" for \\"going\\"), and the d-stop in place of certain \\"z\\" sounds (e.g., \\"idn't\\" for \\"isn't\\"), all of which is seen in other dialects of older Southern American English. Studies have shown that Ozark English has more in common with the dialect of East Tennessee than with the dialect of West Tennessee or even Eastern Arkansas.Michael Ellis, Encyclopedia of Appalachia, 1007-1008. Other distinctive features Ozark and Appalachian English share include phonological idiosyncrasies (many of which it shares with Appalachian English); certain syntactic patterns, such as the use of for to, rather than to, before infinitives in some constructions; and a number of lexical peculiarities.  Controversies surrounding Appalachian English  Many of the original ideas about linguistic boundaries in the US were proposed by Hans Kurath in 1949, but many are under discussion in modern day. When it comes to determining its specific boundaries, some linguists believe that the boundaries should be fuzzy lines, giving rough ideas of boundaries, rather than hard lines, because there is a lot of dialectic variety within these small areas that is often difficult to differentiate. The reality is a range of dialectic variants are commonplace in the Appalachian area of the country. Categorizing all of these different variants under one umbrella may actually further complicate the process of studying the variants of English within the current borders of the Appalachian dialect. In addition to the boundary debates, Appalachian English is surrounded by stereotypical views of the area and the people living in it. Appalachia is often viewed by outsiders as a dialect of uneducated people, due largely in part to the fact that this area is perceived as being low-income and lower class. These stereotypes are often damaging to the people of this area, many of whom choose to hide or modify their accents when they visit or move to areas outside of Appalachia. Despite all of the debates surrounding this dialect and whether or not its boundaries are legitimate and correct, to the people of Appalachia, their variety of English is central to their identities regardless of how it is seen by linguists, as well as outsiders.

The \\"gromatic writers\\" were technical writers who codified their techniques of surveying. HistoryRoman Republic= At the foundation of a colony and the assignation of lands the auspices were taken, for which purpose the presence of the augur was necessary. But the business of the augur did not extend beyond the religious part of the ceremony: the division and measurement of the land were made by professional measurers. These were the finitores mentioned by the early writers,Cicero, De Lege Agraria contra Rullum ii. 13Plautus, Poenulus Prolog. 49 who in the later periods were called mensores and agrimensores. The business of a finitor could only be done by a free man, and the honourable nature of his office is indicated by the rule that there was no bargain for his services, but he received his pay in the form of a gift. These finitores appear also to have acted as judices, under the name of arbitri (single arbiter), in those disputes about boundaries which were purely of a technical, not a legal, character. The first professional surveyor mentioned is Lucius Decidius Saxa, who was employed by Mark Antony in the measurement of camps.Cicero, Philippics, xi. 12, xiv. 10 =Roman Empire= Under the empire the observance of the auspices in the fixing of camps and the establishment of military colonies was less regarded, and the practice of the agrimensores was greatly increased. The distribution of land amongst the veterans, the increase in the number of military colonies, the settlement of Italian peasants in the provinces, the general survey of the empire under Augustus, the separation of private and state domains, led to the establishment of a recognized professional corporation of surveyors. The practice was also codified as a system by technical writers such as Julius Frontinus, Hyginus, Siculus Flaccus, and other Gromatic writers, as they are sometimes termed. The teachers of geometry in the large cities of the empire used to give practical instruction on the system of gromatics. This practical geometry was one of the liberalia studia;Dig. 50. tit. 13. s.l. but the professors of geometry and the teachers of law were not exempted from the obligation of being tutores, and from other such burdens,Frag. Vat. § 150 a fact which shows the subordinate rank which the teachers of elementary science then held. The agrimensor could mark out the limits of the centuriae, and restore the boundaries where they were confused, but he could not assign without a commission from the emperor. Military persons of various classes are also sometimes mentioned as practising surveying, and settling disputes about boundaries. The lower rank of the professional agrimensor, as contrasted with the finitor of earlier periods, is shown by the fact that in the imperial period thare might be a contract with an agrimensor for paying him for his services. =Late empire= The agrimensor of the later period was merely employed in disputes as to the boundaries of properties. The foundation of colonies and the assignation of lands were now less common, though we read of colonies being established to a late period of the empire, and the boundaries of the lands must have been set out in due form.Hyginus, p. 177, ed. Goes. Those who marked out the ground in camps for the soldiers' tents are also called mensores, but they were military men.Vegetius, De Re Militari ii. 7 The functions of the agrimensor are shown by a passage of Hyginus,Hyginus, De Controvers. p. 170 in all questions as to determining boundaries by means of the marks (signa), the area of surfaces, and explaining maps and plans, the services of the agrimensor were required: in all questions that concerned property, right of road, enjoyment of water, and other easements (servitutes) they were not required, for these were purely legal questions. Generally, therefore, they were either employed by the parties themselves to settle boundaries, or they received their instructions for that purpose from a judex. In this capacity they were advocati. But they also acted as judices, and could give a final decision in that class of smaller questions which concerned the quinque pedes of the Lex Mamilia (the law setting which boundary spaces were not subject to usucapio), as appears from Frontinus.Frontinus, pp. 63, 75, ed. Goes Under the Christian emperors the name mensores was changed into agrimensores to distinguish them from another class of mensores, who are mentioned in the codes of Theodosius I and Justinian I.vi. 34, xii. 28 By a rescript of Constantine I and Constans (344 AD) the teachers and learners of geometry received immunity from civil burdens. According to a constitution of Theodosius II and Valentinian III (440 AD),Goesius, p. 344 they received jurisdiction in questions of alluvio; but some writers disagree that this crucial passage is genuine. According to another constitution of the same emperors, the agrimensor was to receive an aureus from each of any three bordering proprietors whose boundaries he settled, and if he set a limes right between proprietors, he received an aureus for each twelfth part of the property through which fee restored the limes. Further, by another constitution of the same emperors,Goesius, p. 343 the young agrimensores were to be called \\"clarissimi\\" while they were students, and when they began to practise their profession, \\"spectabiles\\".Carsten Niebuhr, vol. ii. appendix 2Jean-Baptiste Dureau de la Malle. Economie Politique des Romains, vol. i. p. 170 Writers and works The earliest of the gromatic writers was Frontinus, whose De agrorum qualitate, dealing with the legal aspect of the art, was the subject of a commentary by Aggenus Urbicus, a Christian schoolmaster. Under Trajan a certain Balbus, who had accompanied the emperor on his Dacian campaign, wrote a still extant manual of geometry for land surveyors (Expositio et ratio omnium formarum or mensurarum, probably after a Greek original by Hero), dedicated to a certain Celsus who had invented an improvement in a gromatic instrument (perhaps the dioptra, resembling the modern theodolite); for the treatises of Hyginus see that name. Somewhat later than Trajan was Siculus Flaccus (De condicionibus agrorum, extant), while the most curious treatise on the subject, written in barbarous Latin and entitled Casae litterarum (long a school textbook) is the work of a certain Innocentius (4th-5th century). It is doubtful whether Boetius is the author of the treatises attributed to him. The Gromatici veteres also contains extracts from official registers (probably belonging to the 5th century) of colonial and other land surveys, lists and descriptions of boundary stones, and extracts from the Theodosian Codex. According to Mommsen, the collection had its origin during the 5th century in the office of a vicarius (diocesan governor) of Rome, who had a number of surveyors under him. The surveyors were known by various names: decempedator (with reference to the instrument used); finitor, metator or mensor castrorum in republican times; togati Augustorum as imperial civil officials; professor, auctor as professional instructors. The best edition of the Gromatici is by Karl Lachmann and others (1848) with supplementary volume, Die Schriften der römischen Feldmesser (1852); see also B.G.

National Treasure No. 95 of South Korea. Wine ewer, Goryeo Dynasty, c. 1150-1200 AD Korean ceramic history begins with the oldest earthenware dating to around 8000 BC. Influenced by Chinese ceramics, Korean pottery developed a distinct style of its own, with its own shapes, such as the moon jar or maebyeong version of the Chinese meiping vase, and later styles of painted decoration. Korean ceramic trends had an influence on Japanese pottery and porcelain. Examples of classic Korean wares are the celadons of the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392) and the white porcelains of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897). HistoryNeolithic= The earliest known Korean pottery dates back to around 8.000 BC,Chong Pil Choe, Martin T. Bale, \\"Current Perspectives on Settlement, Subsistence, and Cultivation in Prehistoric Korea\\", (2002), Arctic Anthropology, 39: 1-2, pp. 95-121. and evidence of Mesolithic Pit–Comb Ware culture (or Yunggimun pottery) is found throughout the peninsula, such as in Jeju Island. Jeulmun pottery, or \\"comb-pattern pottery\\", is found after 7000 BC, and is concentrated at sites in west-central regions of the Korean Peninsula, where a number of prehistoric settlements, such as Amsa-dong, existed. Jeulmun pottery bears basic design and form similarities to that of Mongolia, the Amur and Sungari river basins of Manchuria, the Jōmon culture in Japan, and the Baiyue in Southern China and Southeast Asia. =Later Silla= Pottery of the Later Silla period (668-935) was initially simple in color, shape, and design. Celadon subsequently became the main production. Buddhism, the dominant religion of the time in Korea, increased the demand for celadon- glazed wares (cheongja), causing cheongja celadon to evolve very quickly, with more organic shapes and decorations, such as animal and bird motifs. When making cheongja wares, a small amount of iron powder was added to the refined clay, which was then coated with a glaze and an additional small amount of iron powder, and then finally fired. This allowed the glaze to be more durable, with a shinier and glossier finish than white wares. =Goryeo= Dragon-shaped pitcher made in the Goryeo Dynasty. National Treasure No. 61 of South Korea The Goryeo dynasty (918-1392) achieved the unification of the Later Three Kingdoms under Wang Geon. The works of this period are generally considered to be the finest works of ceramics in Korean history. Korean celadon reached its pinnacle with the invention of the sanggam inlay technique in the early 12th century. Key-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish,insects,birds and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays. Jinsa \\"underglaze red\\", a technique using copper oxide pigment to create copper-red designs, was developed in Korea during the 12th century, and later inspired the \\"underglaze red\\" ceramics of the Yuan dynasty. While the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered jars, larger low jars or shallow smaller jars, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip- inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands. Baekja wares came from highly refined white clay, glazed with feldspar, and fired in regulated and clean large kilns. Despite the refining process, white glazes invariably vary as a result of the properties of the clay itself; firing methods were not uniform, temperatures varied and glazes on pieces vary from pure white, in an almost snowy thickness, through milky white that shows the clay beneath deliberately in washed glaze, to light blue and light yellow patinas. After having succeeded the tradition of Goryeo baekja, soft white porcelain was produced in Joseon Dynasty, that carried on, but from the mid-Joseon on hard white porcelain became the mainstream porcelain.Yunesŭkʻo Hanʾguk Wiwŏnhoe. Unesco Korean survey. Dong-a Pub. Co., 1960. p.32Pictorial Korea. Korean Overseas Information Service, 2004. p.28 The baekja wares reached their zenith immediately before the Joseon Dynasty came to power. Fine pieces have recently been found in the area around Wolchil Peak near Mount Kumgang. The transitional wares of white became expressions of the Joseon Dynasty celebrations of victory in many pieces decorated with Korean calligraphy. Traditionally white wares were used by both the scholarly Confucian class, the nobility and royalty on more formal occasions. =Joseon= Blue and white porcelain jar with pine and bamboo designs was made in 1489, Joseon dynasty, Korea. Dongguk University Museum, Seoul. 15th century. Joseon dynasty, Korea. Blue and white porcelain jar with plum and bamboo design. During the Joseon dynasty, (1392-1897) ceramic wares were considered to represent the highest quality of achievement from royal, city, and provincial kilns, the last of which were export-driven wares. Joseon enjoyed a long period of growth in royal and provincial kilns, and much work of the highest quality still preserved. Wares evolved along Chinese lines in terms of colour, shape, and technique. Celadon, white porcelain, and storage pottery were similar, but with certain variations in glazes, incision designs, florality, and weight. The Ming influence in blue and white wares using cobalt-blue glazes existed, but without the pthalo blue range, and the three-dimensional glassine colour depth of Ming Dynasty Chinese works. Simplified designs emerged early on. Buddhist designs still prevailed in celadon wares: lotus flowers, and willow trees. The form most often seen was that of pear-shaped bottles. Notable were thinner glazes, and colourless glazes for buncheong or stoneware. During the Joseon period, Koreans applied the sanggam tradition to create buncheong ceramics. In contrast to the refined elegance of Goryeo celadon, buncheong is designed to be natural, unassuming, and practical. However, the buncheong tradition was gradually replaced by Joseon white porcelain, its aristocratic counterpart, and disappeared in Korea by the end of the 16th century. Buncheong became known and prized in Japan as Mishima. Joseon white porcelain representing Joseon ceramics was produced throughout the entire period of the Joseon dynasty. The plain and austere white porcelain suitably reflects the taste of Neo-Confucian scholars.Scott Hudson, National Museum of Korea, Sol Publishing, 2005 Qing colouring, brighter and almost Scythian in enamel imitation, was rejected by Korean potters, in favour of simpler, less decorated wares in keeping with a new dynasty that built itself on Confucian doctrine. Generally, the ceramics of this dynasty is divided into early, middle, and late periods, changing every two centuries, approximately; thus 1300 to 1500 is the early period, 1500 to 1700 the middle, and 1700 to 1900-1910 the late period. The wares began to assume more traditional Korean glazes and more specific designs to meet regional needs. This is to be expected, as the Scythian art influences were of the former dynasty. The rise of white porcelain occurred as a result of Confucian influence and ideals, resulting in purer, less pretentious forms lacking artifice and complexity. In 1592 during the Japanese invasion of Korea, entire villages of Korean potters were forcibly relocated to Japan, damaging the pottery industry as craftsmen had to relearn techniques because the masters were gone.  Exports  Nearly all exports of Korean ceramics went to Japan, and most were from provincial coastal kilns, especially in the Busan area. Export occurred in two ways: either through trading or through invasion and theft of pottery and the abductionFinancial Times - Korea’s artistic treasures – and their links to China and Japan by David Pilling APRIL 11, 2014 to Japan of families of potters who made the wares. The voluntary immigration of potters was improbable since Joseon pottery was administrated by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy (工曹) (:ko:공조 (행정기관)). As a national resource, pottery technician trade with foreign countries was prohibited. Kilns Central to Korean success were the chambered climbing kilns, based on the Chinese dragon kiln, that were used throughout the Joseon dynasty and exported abroad, especially to Japan by Korean kiln-makers where they were renamed as noborigama in the Karatsu area from the 17th century on. Modern kilns are either electric or gas-fired.

The district of Mirpur has a population of 456,200 and covers an area of . The district is mainly mountainous with some plains. Its hot, dry climate and other geographical conditions closely resemble those of Jhelum and Gujrat, the adjoining districts of Punjab. History The present day Mirpur Division (shown in red) is roughly coterminus with the Mirpur district of 1947 During the British colonial times, Mirpur was one of the five districts of the Jammu province in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. According to the 1941 census, the it had a population of 386,655, roughly 80% of whom were Muslim and 16% were Hindu. It consisted of three tehsils: Kotli, Mirpur and Bhimber. Kotli and Bhimber have since been made into separate districts. The three districts constitute the present day Mirpur Division in the Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Small portions of the erstwhile Mirpur district are also included in the Rajouri district in the Indian-administered Kashmir. The original Mirpur district, along with the districts of Poonch and Rajouri, had close geographic, ethnic and cultural connections with West Punjab, more so than with the Jammu city and the rest of the Jammu province. Due to these reasons, scholar Christopher Snedden states that the people of Mirpur had a strong desire to join Pakistan during the Partition of India. In November 1947, Mirpur district was the site of the Mirpur Massacre where Hindus and Sikhs, as well as many refugees from the Partition of India, were killed by armed Pakistani tribesmen and soldiers.https://www.jammukashmirnow.com/Encyc/2019/11/25/25-November-1947-Mirpur- massacre-An-ill-fated-day-that-reminds-us-of-injustice-and-infringement- brutality-and-bloodshed.html Language and ethnicity There is considerable ambiguity surrounding the name of the local language: its speakers call it variously Pahari, Mirpur Pahari, Mirpuri and Pothwari, while some label it as Punjabi. Sociolinguists have regarded it as one of the three major dialects of the Pahari-Pothwari language complex, which is intermediate between Lahnda and Punjabi. Mirpur Pahari is mutually intelligible with the other two major dialects – Pothwari of the Potohar Plateau in Punjab and the Pahari spoken to the north in Azad Kashmir and around Murree – and shares with them between 77 and 84% of its basic vocabulary, although the difference with the northernmost varieties (in Muzaffarabad) is sufficient to impede understanding. Mirpuri speakers have a strong sense of Kashmiri identity that takes precedence over linguistic identification with closely related groups outside of Azad Kashmir. Another language spoken here is Gujari. The local dialect is closely related to the Gujari varieties spoken in the rest of Azad Kashmir and in Hazara. Other languages spoken include Urdu and English.

He is known for wearing a fedora and his election slogan, \\"Give 'em Hec\\". Early life Prior to being elected, Clouthier was Vice-President of Hec Clouthier and Sons Inc., a well-known lumbering firm in the Upper Ottawa Valley. Clouthier served as a community volunteer, as Campaign Chair for the United Way Upper Ottawa Valley, Chair of the Ottawa Valley Lumber Association, President of the Pembroke and Area Chamber of Commerce, Chair of Quality Assurance, Risk Management, and French language services for the Pembroke Regional Hospital, and as Chair of Personnel for St. Joseph's Non Profit Housing. Taught by Jesuits at Loyola College in Montreal, Clouthier holds certificates in Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) from Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration and in Alternative Dispute Resolution from the University of Windsor. Federal politics He sought the Liberal nomination in Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke in 1988, challenging the Liberal incumbent Len Hopkins. More than 3,500 people voted in the nomination election, with Hopkins winning by a narrow margin. Clouthier announced he would once again seek the nomination in 1993, but his candidacy was denied by then-party leader Jean Chrétien who protected Hopkins, who had held the seat for twenty five years. Clouthier ran as an independent candidate in the 1993 federal election, getting over 10,000 votes and finishing second to Hopkins. In 1997, Hopkins announced he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. There was a spirited battle for the Liberal nomination and over 4,000 memberships were sold. At the party's local convention, Clouthier defeated three other candidates to win the nomination. He subsequently won the general election and became MP for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. He was elected by his fellow Liberal MPs as Chair of Eastern Ontario caucus, and was named by the Prime Minister as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of National Defence in 2000. In the 2000 election he was defeated by Canadian Alliance candidate Cheryl Gallant, largely due to his controversial endorsement of gun control, which had become highly unpopular in the region. After the election, he was asked by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to be a Special Advisor in the Prime Minister's Office. He served in the PMO until Paul Martin took over as Prime Minister. Following a long absence from federal politics, Clouthier ran as an independent candidate in the 2011 federal election in his former riding of Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke. Clouthier placed second to incumbent Gallant. His tally of almost 10,000 votes was the most earned by any independent candidate in Ontario. In the 2015 federal election, Clouthier again stood as an independent. Following a nationwide surge for the Liberals, Clouthier's vote total fell, and he finished third behind Gallant and the Liberal candidate but Clouthier once again received the most votes of any independent in Ontario. Personal life Clouthier comes from a large family with five sisters and four brothers as siblings. He and his spouse Debbie were married in 1975 and they have three sons and two grandsons . In fall 2002, Clouthier met U.S. President George W. Bush in Detroit at a border conference. The American President was \\"smitten\\" by Clouthier's fedora and asked for one.Globe and Mail, November 30, 2002 Clouthier had a fedora made for the President and sent it to the White House. Following his time in office, Clouthier served as Executive Director of the Ontario Horse Racing Industry Association (OHRIA) from 2007 to 2010. Horse racing in Ontario is a multibillion-dollar industry. An avid horse racer, Clouthier holds a professional harness horse driver's licence. Clouthier resigned as the Executive Director of OHRIA prior to contesting the 2011 federal election. Clouthier has a passion for long- distance running, having completed 40 marathons, including 6 runs of the Boston Marathon. In 2020 he ran the Boston Marathon at age 70. In 2017, Clouthier released a book he authored about his life titled \\"Give 'Em Hec!\\" and in 2019 he authored another book, this one about the life of his father, Hector Clouthier Sr. This book is called \\"Mr. Lumberjack\\" . Membership in Algonquin Nation Clouthier is a member of the Algonquins of Greater Golden Lake First Nation according to the \\"Algonquin Nation Standardized Identification Criteria\\" of the Algonquin Nation Tribal Council.

The central concept of fuzzy measure theory is the fuzzy measure (also capacity, see ) which was introduced by Choquet in 1953 and independently defined by Sugeno in 1974 in the context of fuzzy integrals. There exists a number of different classes of fuzzy measures including plausibility/belief measures; possibility/necessity measures; and probability measures which are a subset of classical measures. Definitions Let \\\\mathbf{X} be a universe of discourse, \\\\mathcal{C} be a class of subsets of \\\\mathbf{X}, and E,F\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}. A function g:\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} where # \\\\emptyset \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\Rightarrow g(\\\\emptyset)=0 # E \\\\subseteq F \\\\Rightarrow g(E)\\\\leq g(F) is called a fuzzy measure. A fuzzy measure is called normalized or regular if g(\\\\mathbf{X})=1. Properties of fuzzy measures A fuzzy measure is: * additive if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} such that E \\\\cap F = \\\\emptyset , we have g(E \\\\cup F) = g(E) + g(F). ; * supermodular if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} , we have g(E \\\\cup F) + g(E \\\\cap F) \\\\geq g(E) + g(F); * submodular if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} , we have g(E \\\\cup F) + g(E \\\\cap F) \\\\leq g(E) + g(F); * superadditive if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} such that E \\\\cap F = \\\\emptyset , we have g(E \\\\cup F) \\\\geq g(E) + g(F); * subadditive if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} such that E \\\\cap F = \\\\emptyset , we have g(E \\\\cup F) \\\\leq g(E) + g(F); * symmetric if for any E,F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} , we have E = F implies g(E) = g(F); * Boolean if for any E \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C} , we have g(E) = 0 or g(E) = 1 . Understanding the properties of fuzzy measures is useful in application. When a fuzzy measure is used to define a function such as the Sugeno integral or Choquet integral, these properties will be crucial in understanding the function's behavior. For instance, the Choquet integral with respect to an additive fuzzy measure reduces to the Lebesgue integral. In discrete cases, a symmetric fuzzy measure will result in the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator. Submodular fuzzy measures result in convex functions, while supermodular fuzzy measures result in concave functions when used to define a Choquet integral. Möbius representation Let g be a fuzzy measure, the Möbius representation of g is given by the set function M, where for every E,F \\\\subseteq X , :M(E) = \\\\sum_{F \\\\subseteq E} (-1)^{E \\\\backslash F} g(F). The equivalent axioms in Möbius representation are: # M(\\\\emptyset)=0. # \\\\sum_{F \\\\subseteq Ei \\\\in F} M(F) \\\\geq 0, for all E \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X} and all i \\\\in E A fuzzy measure in Möbius representation M is called normalized if \\\\sum_{E \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X}}M(E)=1. Möbius representation can be used to give an indication of which subsets of X interact with one another. For instance, an additive fuzzy measure has Möbius values all equal to zero except for singletons. The fuzzy measure g in standard representation can be recovered from the Möbius form using the Zeta transform: : g(E) = \\\\sum_{F \\\\subseteq E} M(F), \\\\forall E \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X} . Simplification assumptions for fuzzy measures Fuzzy measures are defined on a semiring of sets or monotone class which may be as granular as the power set of X, and even in discrete cases the number of variables can as large as 2X. For this reason, in the context of multi-criteria decision analysis and other disciplines, simplification assumptions on the fuzzy measure have been introduced so that it is less computationally expensive to determine and use. For instance, when it is assumed the fuzzy measure is additive, it will hold that g(E) = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in E} g(\\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}) and the values of the fuzzy measure can be evaluated from the values on X. Similarly, a symmetric fuzzy measure is defined uniquely by X values. Two important fuzzy measures that can be used are the Sugeno- or \\\\lambda-fuzzy measure and k-additive measures, introduced by Sugeno and Grabisch respectively. =Sugeno λ-measure= The Sugeno \\\\lambda-measure is a special case of fuzzy measures defined iteratively. It has the following definition: Definition Let \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\left\\\\lbrace x_1,\\\\dots,x_n \\\\right\\\\rbrace be a finite set and let \\\\lambda \\\\in (-1,+\\\\infty). A Sugeno \\\\lambda-measure is a function g:2^X\\\\to[0,1] such that # g(X) = 1. # if A, B\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X} (alternatively A, B\\\\in 2^{\\\\mathbf{X}}) with A \\\\cap B = \\\\emptyset then g(A \\\\cup B) =g(A)+g(B)+\\\\lambda g(A)g(B). As a convention, the value of g at a singleton set \\\\left\\\\lbrace x_i \\\\right\\\\rbrace is called a density and is denoted by g_i = g(\\\\left\\\\lbrace x_i \\\\right\\\\rbrace). In addition, we have that \\\\lambda satisfies the property : \\\\lambda +1 = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1+\\\\lambda g_i) . Tahani and Keller as well as Wang and Klir have showed that once the densities are known, it is possible to use the previous polynomial to obtain the values of \\\\lambda uniquely. =k-additive fuzzy measure= The k-additive fuzzy measure limits the interaction between the subsets E \\\\subseteq X to size E=k. This drastically reduces the number of variables needed to define the fuzzy measure, and as k can be anything from 1 (in which case the fuzzy measure is additive) to X, it allows for a compromise between modelling ability and simplicity. Definition A discrete fuzzy measure g on a set X is called k-additive ( 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq \\\\mathbf{X}) if its Möbius representation verifies M(E) = 0 , whenever E > k for any E \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X} , and there exists a subset F with k elements such that M(F) eq 0 . Shapley and interaction indices In game theory, the Shapley value or Shapley index is used to indicate the weight of a game. Shapley values can be calculated for fuzzy measures in order to give some indication of the importance of each singleton. In the case of additive fuzzy measures, the Shapley value will be the same as each singleton. For a given fuzzy measure g, and \\\\mathbf{X}=n, the Shapley index for every i,\\\\dots,n \\\\in X is: : \\\\phi (i) = \\\\sum_{E \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}} \\\\frac{(n-E-1)!E!}{n!} [g(E \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}) - g(E)]. The Shapley value is the vector \\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}(g) = (\\\\psi(1),\\\\dots,\\\\psi(n)).

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and held ministerial office in the party's earliest governments. He served terms as Postmaster-General (1904), Minister for Home Affairs (1908–1909), and Minister for External Affairs (1914–1916). However, Mahon is chiefly known as the only person to be expelled from the Parliament of Australia, for making \\"seditious and disloyal utterances\\" about the British Empire. He failed to win his seat back at the by-election. Early life Mahon was born at Killurin, near Tullamore, then King's County, now County Offaly, Ireland and migrated in 1869 with his family to Canada and the United States, where he learnt the printing trade. He returned to Ireland in about 1880 and worked as editor of the New Ross Standard, reporting on the infamous Shanbogh killing as well as helping to organise the defence of the two accused. He was actively involved in the boycotting campaign of the Irish National Land League and was jailed in 1881 along with other Irish National Land League leaders, including Charles Stewart Parnell, but was released due to ill-health. He emigrated to Australia in 1882 to avoid re-arrest and helped to organise the Australian tour of the Irish nationalist leaders John and William Redmond in 1883. He then worked for newspapers in Goulburn and Sydney, before acquiring a newspaper in Gosford. In 1888 he married Mary Alice L'Estrange of Melbourne. After failing to be elected to the seat of Wollombi at the 1891 NSW parliamentary elections, Mahon sold his newspaper and moved to Melbourne, where he worked for the Australian Mining Standard. In 1895, he moved to the Western Australian goldfields and started a newspaper, the Menzies Miner, at the mining town of Menzies. Political careerColonial politics= 1901 election, including Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, Billy Hughes, Frank Tudor, and King O'Malley. Mahon is middle row standing fourth from left. In 1897 Mahon stood unsuccessfully for the state seat of North Coolgardie and the following year he was appointed editor of the Kalgoorlie Sun, a salacious newspaper similar to John Norton's Truth, in which he regularly denounced the Forrest government for alleged corrupt practices. Mahon's notoriety as a fighting editor helped him to win the new federal seat of Coolgardie at the 1901 election for Labour. =Federal politics= Upon entry into federal parliament, Mahon gained a reputation for savage wit and bitter sarcasm. He advocated Aboriginal rights, calling for a royal commission into their treatment in WA and for an amendment to the Constitution to give the federal parliament power to pass laws relating to Aborigines in the states. It was not until 1967 that that amendment was approved at a referendum. In 1905 Mahon helped shepherd through both houses of parliament resolutions in support of Irish home rule. Thereafter he became increasingly identified as an advocate of Irish nationalism. In 1907 Cardinal Patrick Moran invited him to deliver the St Patrick's Day address in Sydney. In 1909 he was a key player in the St Patrick's Day celebrations in Melbourne, addressed by the Governor General. In July 1910 he moved a resolution in the House of Representatives requesting the new king George V to omit from the coronation oath references offensive to Catholics. Mahon in 1908 He was Postmaster-General in the Watson government in 1904 and Minister for Home Affairs in the Fisher government of 1908–09. In the latter role he directed the District Surveyor, Charles Scrivener, to examine the Yass-Canberra district to determine the most suitable place for the seat of government. In 1913, the seat of Coolgardie was abolished and partly replaced by Dampier, for which he stood unsuccessfully. He re-entered Parliament in the seat of Kalgoorlie; following the death of the incumbent, Charlie Frazer, a by- election was called, but at the close of nominations on 22 December 1913 Mahon was the sole candidate and was declared elected unopposed. He became Minister for External Affairs in December 1914 until the Labor Party split in 1916. =Expulsion from parliament= Mahon lost his seat in 1917, but won it back in 1919. After the death in October 1920 of the Irish nationalist Terence MacSwiney, who had been on hunger strike, Mahon attacked British policy in Ireland at an open-air meeting in Melbourne on 7 November, claiming that the sobs of MacSwiney's widow would one day shake the foundations of ‘this bloody and accursed Empire’. On 11 November the Prime Minister Billy Hughes moved to expel him and early the following morning the House of Representatives passed a resolution that Mahon had made \\"seditious and disloyal utterances at a public meeting,\\" and was \\"guilty of conduct unfitting him to remain a member of this House and inconsistent with the oath of allegiance which he has taken as a member of this House\\". Mahon is, and is likely to remain, the only MP ever to be expelled from the Federal Parliament, since, under Section 8 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, neither house of the Parliament now has the power to expel a member. According to Mahon's biographer Jeff Kildea, it is this singular event for which he is mostly remembered \\"despite his long and eventful career in journalism, business and politics both in Ireland and Australia\\". Mahon failed to win back his seat at the December 1920 Kalgoorlie by-election, suffering a 3.5 percent swing. In 2016, Labor MP Graham Perrett moved a private member's motion in Parliament to recognise that Mahon's expulsion was unjust and a misuse of power then invested by the House. The motion carried. https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2016-11-21.153.2https://www.msn.com/en- au/news/australia/comment-could-a-senator-like-fraser-anning-be-expelled-from- parliament-for-offensive-statements/ar-BBUQwLG?ocid=spartandhp Later life After leaving parliament, Mahon continued to work as the managing director of the Catholic Church Property Insurance Co., the insurance company he had established in 1912 at the request of the Catholic bishops. In December 1921 he sailed to Europe for the Irish Race Convention in Paris. However, struck down by illness he missed the conference. After recovering he went to Rome and had an audience with Pope Pius XI before visiting Ireland. On returning to Australia in June 1922 he expected to be appointed Consul General for Ireland, but the Civil War put an end to that. In August 1931, while in Sydney for a meeting of the board of the Catholic Church Property Insurance Co, he fell ill and on his return to Melbourne succumbed to the lung disease that had plagued him all his life. He died on 28 August 1931 and is buried in Box Hill Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and four children.

He is best known for his participation in the Irish Confederate Wars and in particular his defence of Clonmel in 1650. O'Neill was a member of the O'Neill dynasty, the leaders of which left Ireland in the flight of the Earls in 1607. Hugh Dubh's father, Art Óg O'Neill, was among those exiles who made careers for themselves in the Spanish Army of Flanders. Hugh Dubh was, as a result, born in Brussels in 1611 and grew up in the Irish military community there, becoming a professional soldier and serving in the Irish regiment of the Spanish army in Flanders during the Eighty Years' War against the United Provinces of the Netherlands. In 1642, his uncle, Owen Roe O'Neill, organised the return of 300 Irish officers in the Spanish service to Ireland to support the Irish Rebellion of 1641. O'Neill's men became the nucleus of the Ulster army of Confederate Ireland - a de facto independent Irish state. Hugh Dubh was captured early in the war by Scottish Covenanter enemies, but was exchanged back to his own side after the Confederate victory at the Battle of Benburb in 1646. He subsequently rose to prominence after the death of his commander, Owen Roe O'Neill, in 1649. In 1649, after the onset of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Hugh Dubh was sent south with 2,000 of the best Ulster troops to defend southern Ireland. He distinguished himself at the Siege of Clonmel in May 1650, inflicting the worst casualties ever experienced by the New Model Army. He was then made commander of the defenders at the Siege of Limerick (1650-51), fighting off the Parliamentarians' first attempt to take the city in late 1650. However, the following year, Henry Ireton besieged the city again, eventually forcing Hugh Dubh to surrender when the city's population was dying of hunger and plague, and part of his garrison mutinied against him. Ireton himself died of disease. Under the terms of surrender, Hugh Dubh was to be executed for his stubborn defence of the city, but the Parliamentarian general Edmund Ludlow did not carry out the sentence and instead sent Hugh Dubh into imprisonment in the Tower of London. Hugh Dubh's imprisonment was cut short by the intervention of the Spanish Ambassador to England, who argued that Hugh Dubh was a Spanish subject. Hugh Dubh was subsequently released into Spanish custody on condition that he would not serve in campaigns against English forces. He did not, therefore, return to Flanders, but was posted to Spain, where he became a General of Artillery, helping to suppress a rebellion (known as the Reaper's War) in Catalonia. He became the Spanish recognised 5th Earl of Tyrone upon the death of his first cousin, Hugh Eoghan. In around 1660, after the English Restoration, Hugh Dubh wrote to Charles II and asked for his family's ancestral lands to be restored, and that he be made the English Earl of Tyrone. However, Charles did not grant the request and Hugh Dubh died of disease later that year. See also *Irish Confederate Wars *Wars of the Three Kingdoms Sources * J.G.

He was a Theatine priest, mathematician, and writer. Biography Guarini was born in Modena. He was accepted as a Theatine novice in 1639, spent his novitiate at the monastery of San Silvestro al Quirinale in Rome, where he studied architecture, theology, philosophy and mathematics.Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 291. He returned to Modena in 1647, where he was ordained in 1648. He rose quickly in the Theatine hierarchy, becoming first auditor, then superintendent of works, treasurer, lecturer in philosophy, procuratore, and finally provost in 1654. Prince Alfonso supported another candidate and Guarini was soon replaced and had to leave Modena. The next few years are poorly documented. He became a member of the Theatine House of Parma in 1656 and apparently visited Prague and Lisbon before publishing his play La Pietà trionfante in Messina in 1660, where he was a lecturer in mathematics. He wrote four mathematical books in both Latin and Italian, of which Euclides adauctus is a work on descriptive geometry. In 1665, he published a mathematical-philosophical tract Placita Philosophica defending the geocentric universe against Copernicus and Galileo. The Carignano Palace in Turin He designed a large number of public and private buildings in Turin, including the palaces of the Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy (as well as his sister (Louise Christine of Savoy), the Royal Church of San Lorenzo (1666–1680), most of the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (housing the Shroud of Turin; begun in 1668 by Amedeo di Castellamonte), the Palazzo Carignano (1679–85), the Castle of Racconigi and many other public and ecclesiastical buildings at Modena, Messina, Verona, Vienna, Prague, Lisbon, and Paris. The Palazzo Carignano is regarded as one of the finest urban palaces of the second half of the 17th century in Italy. Guarini appears to have been influenced by Borromini. Between 1657 and 1659 he stayed in Spain, where he studied Moorish buildings; this influenced the style of some of his buildings in Turin. In 1660 he settled in Messina.Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 291. Guarini died in Milan. In architecture, his successors include Filippo Juvarra, and Juvarra's pupil Bernardo Vittone. The latter published his designs in Architettura Civile in 1737.Guarino Guarini.

For his early education he proceeded first to the college of Charleville, and afterwards to that of Reims. In 1788 he returned to Mézières, where he was attached to the school of engineering as draughtsman to the professors of physics and chemistry. In 1793 he became professor of hydrography at Collioure and Port-Vendre. While there he sent several papers, in which some questions of navigation were treated geometrically, to Gaspard Monge, at that time minister of marine, through whose influence he obtained an appointment in Paris. Towards the close of 1794, when the Ecole Polytechnique was established, he was appointed along with Monge over the department of descriptive geometry. There he instructed some of the ablest Frenchmen of the day, among them SD Poisson, François Arago and A Fresnel. Accompanying Guyton de Morveau in his expedition, earlier in the year, he was present at the battle of Fleurus, and entered Brussels with the French army. In 1816, on the accession of Louis XVIII, he was expelled from his chair by government. He retained, however, till his death the office of professor in the faculty of sciences in the Ecole Normale, to which he had been appointed in 1810. The necessary royal assent was in 1823 refused to the election of Hachette to the Académie des Sciences, and it was not till 1831, after the Revolution, that he obtained that honour. He died at Paris on 16 January 1834. Hachette was held in high esteem for his private worth, as well as for his scientific attainments and great public services. His labours were chiefly in the field of descriptive geometry, with its application to the arts and mechanical engineering. It was left to him to develop the geometry of Monge, and to him also is due in great measure the rapid advancement which France made soon after the establishment of the École Polytechnique in the construction of machinery. Hachette's principal works are: *Deux Suppléments à la Géométrie descriptive de Monge (1811 and 1818) *Éléments de géométrie à trois dimensions (1817) *Collection des épures de géométrie, etc. (1795 and 1817) *Applications de géométrie descriptive (1817) *Traité de géométrie descriptive, etc. (1822) *Traité élémentaire des machines (1811) *' (1804–1815) He also contributed many valuable papers to the leading scientific journals of his time.

It is located on Moose Factory Island, near the mouth of the Moose River, which is at the southern end of James Bay. It was the first English-speaking settlement in lands now making up Ontariohttp://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/maps/ontario- boundaries.aspx and the second Hudson's Bay Company post to be set up in North America after Fort Rupert. On the mainland, across the Moose River, is the nearby community of Moosonee, which is accessible by water taxi in the summer, ice road in the winter, and chartered helicopter in the off-season (break-up or freeze-up). The settlement is mainly inhabited by the Cree, but the hospital that provides healthcare services to the people of the island and surrounding area (collectively known as the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority) employs a diverse group of people. The term \\"Factory\\" refers to the jurisdiction of a factor (a business agent or merchant in charge of buying or selling) of the Hudson's Bay Company.  History  Moose Factory circa 1868-1870 Moose Factory, circa 1910 The area was explored by Pierre-Esprit Radisson in the winter of 1670/71 from the base at Rupert House. In 1673, Charles Bayly of the Hudson's Bay Company established a fur-trading post originally called Moose Fort. Besides trading, it was also intended to protect the company's interests from French traders to the south. The fort was profitable and had a direct impact on the fur trade in New France. So in 1686, Chevalier de Troyes led a small contingent of French soldiers north on an expedition to raid HBC forts. The English defenders were caught by total surprise and surrendered. The French captured Moose Fort and renamed it to Fort St. Louis. Ten years later in 1696, the English recaptured it and burned it to the ground. No trace has remained of this original fort. The Hudson's Bay Company set up a new fort in 1730, one mile upstream from the old site, to accommodate Cree traders for whom travel to the other James Bay posts was too dangerous. Five years later, this one also was destroyed by a fire that started in the kitchen, but was rebuilt over a period of seven years. In 1821, when the Hudson's Bay Company merged with the rival North West Company, there were no longer any serious threats and the post expanded beyond the fort's palisades. Thereafter it came to be known as Moose Factory. It became HBC's main base on James Bay, being the administrative headquarters of the Southern Department. The Governor of Rupert's Land and Council met frequently there to plan for the coming year's operations. In 1905, the Cree signed a treaty (Treaty 9) with the government that established the Factory Island Indian Reserve. Around the same time, the Parisian furrier company Revillon Frères set up a trading post on the west bank of the Moose River. This post, first known as Moose River Post, grew into the town of Moosonee and provided stiff competition to the HBC Moose Factory post. In 1931, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was completed at Moosonee. This allowed supplies to be delivered from the south by train, thereby making redundant the once-yearly sea voyages on which the settlement had previously relied. In 1936, the last supply ship arrived. After World War II, the Hudson's Bay Company transformed into a retail business, and in 1960 it opened a modern retail store in Moose Factory. The HBC staff house and other historic properties were converted into the open-air museum of Centennial Park that opened in 1967. The HBC continued to operate in Moose Factory until 1987, when its operations in northern Canada, including Moose Factory, were sold to The North West Company. Today, the North West Company operates a grocery and general goods store at the Moose Cree Complex and a furniture, outdoor vehicles, fast food outlet and convenience store near some of the historic HBC buildings. Climate The Moose Factory and Moosonee area has a very cold humid continental climate. The climate data is from the Moosonee around to the west. Economy The economy of the island is based on the healthcare, service, tourism, and construction industries. The largest employer is the Weeneebayko General Hospital, followed by Moose Cree First Nation and Northern Stores. Northern Stores, G.G.'s and QuickStop are the main stores on the island. \\"The Complex\\" is the retail and community centre containing a grocery store (Northern Stores), a restaurant, a Canada Post outlet, a pharmacy, and offices. Although few people practice a solely traditional lifestyle (i.e. living only off the land), the majority of people still participate in the spring and fall moose hunt. Traditional skills such as preparing and tanning of moose hides as well as the creation of moccasins and moose hide mitts with beading are still practiced today. Other crafts practiced in Moose Factory include the production of tamarack geese, snowshoes, and soapstone carvings which are sold locally. Healthcare Weeneebayko General Hospital In 1949 the Moose Factory General Hospital was built - a $3 million project - as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients on Moose Factory Island \\"in order to isolate the disease\\" in response to a tuberculosis epidemic. It served both First Nations and Inuit patients. Today the Weeneebayko General Hospital provides medical services as part of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority to residents of Moose Factory, Moosonee as well as Fort Albany, Ontario, Attawapiskat First Nation, Kashechewan First Nation and Peawanuck First Nation. The medical staff (consisting of 12 family physicians, 1 anesthetist and 1 surgeon) work with their tertiary care facilities in Kingston, Toronto, Sudbury, and Timmins. The hospital provides various specialized services: * 24-hour emergency services * family medicine clinics * dentistry * occupational and rehabilitative services * general surgery and anesthesia * dialysis * traditional healing program (with counsellors and traditional healers) * diabetes education services * regularly scheduled specialities including: pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, geriatrics rheumatology, ophthalmology, rehabilitation and neurology * diagnostic imaging (x-ray and ultrasound) * laboratory services Chartered aircraft \\"schedevacs\\" or \\"medivacs\\" are used to provide patients with transportation to diagnostic tests (e.g. CT and MRI) and specialize care. Queen's University is the primary university link with many medical students completing placements at the hospital. However, there are also associations with the University of Toronto, McMaster University, University of Ottawa, and the Northern Ontario School of Medicine.  Education  Moose Factory has three schools: * Ministik Public School is a public elementary school operated by the Moose Factory Island District School Area Board. The school opened in 1984 and has JK to Grade 8. * Delores D. Echum Composite School is a senior elementary and secondary school operated by the Moose Cree Education Authority. The school opened in 1997 and has Grades 7 to 12. * Moose Factory Academy of Christian Education is a private elementary school and opened in 1995. Some post-secondary programs are provided by Northern College via distant learning (correspondence, video, and web-based courses) or Ontario Learn Courses (web-based). James Bay Education Centre Northern College- Education Complex is a liaison base for the community college. In Moose Factory, Bishop Horden Memorial School also known as Horden Hall Residential School, Moose Factory Residential School, Moose Fort Indian Residential School (1907-1963), named after Bishop Horden, serving all the communities in the James Bay area, was run by the Anglican Church. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated the school which, like others across Canada, where the highest number of premature deaths among children at these schools was from tuberculosis. Political organization The island is politically divided into two political entities: * Factory Island 1 (population: 1451) - Indian reserve of that make up the northern two-thirds of the island, belonging to the Moose Cree First Nation and is governed by an elected Chief, Deputy Chief, and Councilors. In 2005, Patricia Faries-Akiwenzie, a practicing lawyer from Moose Factory, became the first woman to be elected as Chief. * Unorganized Cochrane District (population: 1007) - Unincorporated southern third of the island, home to the old Hudson's Bay Company post and government services, governed by the provincial Local Services Board and the federal Weeneebayko Health Ahtuskaywin that administers the regional medical facility, Weeneebayko General Hospital. The Electoral districts include: * Federally, Moose Factory is part of the Timmins--James Bay electoral district. * Provincially, Moose Factory is part of the Timmins-James Bay electoral district. The Mushkegowuk Tribal Council, a non-profit Regional Chiefs' Council representing eight Cree First Nations in northern Ontario, has its headquarters in Moose Factory. The namesake Moose Factory 68 Reserve, also belonging to the Moose Cree First Nation, is about upstream on the east banks of the Moose River. Attractions and tourism Notable attractions include the Centennial Park with its 19th- century buildings associated with the Hudson's Bay Company post, Cree Cultural Interpretive Centre, the Cree Village Eco Lodge and St. Thomas' Anglican Church. Outdoor tourism in summer and winter, such as trap-line tours, canoe expeditions, and snowmobile trips, are locally provided. The Tidewater Provincial Park is nearby on the adjacent island facing Moosonee. Visitors also take freight canoe tours that leave from Moose Factory or Moosonee downstream to James Bay at the mouth of the river, or upstream to Fossil Island. = Cree Cultural Interpretive Centre = Cree Cultural Interpretive Centre is an interpretive centre that displays many aspects of Cree culture and crafts. =Cree Eco Lodge= Cree Eco Lodge dining room Cree Village Eco Lodge is an eco-tourist lodge and restaurant.

The staff house was built between 1847 and 1850, making it the oldest building in the James Bay area and the last surviving HBC officers' dwelling. In the Hudson's Bay Company cemetery the oldest tombstone is dated 1802 and marks the grave of the Cree wife and children of John Thomas who was the post's factor at that time. There are only a few graves of British men, since they would return home upon retirement or completion of their contract. In total, 51 graves stones can be found here. Joseph Turner House is the oldest known surviving servant house of the HBC, built in 1863 and named for HBC trader Joseph Turner (1783-1865), son of an English surveyor and Ojibway wife. William McLeod House was the carpenter's house built in 1889-90 by HBC carpenter William McLeod. Ham Sackabuckiskum House is the only surviving Cree summer home and one of the first balloon-frame construction house in Moose Factory, built in 1926 by the HBC as an incentive to ensure loyalty from Cree trappers. The blacksmith shop is the last known surviving HBC blacksmith shop, built in 1849, and was used until 1934. The powder magazine is the only stone structure, built in 1865, was part of the palisaded warehouse complex. In the early 20th century, it was converted from gunpowder to general storage. = St. Thomas' Anglican Church = St. Thomas' Anglican Church St. Thomas' Anglican Church is a historic Carpenter Gothic style Anglican church built by the Hudson's Bay Company.

The painter is buried in the church of San Bernardino, Padua. Guariento's major commissions in Padua include the choir frescoes for the Augustinian hermits' church of the Eremitani, which depict scenes from the life of St. Augustine, the order's founder. Painted in 1338, the cycle was severely damaged by the bombardment of 1944. Guariento also decorated the chapel of the Palazzo Carrara in Padua with panel paintings of the Madonna, St Matthew Evangelist and 25 angels. After the reconstruction of the palace in 1779 the panels were transferred to the Museo Civico of Padua. The decoration of the chapel is the subject of a recent study by Kornelia Mohl.Die Ausstattung der Cappella Carrara in der Reggia Carrarese in Padua: durch den Paduaner Meister Guariento di Arpo - Ein Rekonstruktionsversuch (Vienna: AV Akademikerverlag, 2014) In 1365, having already acquired high renown in his native city, he was invited by the Venetian republic to paint a representation of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Palazzo Ducale, which survives in a fragmentary state, having been rediscovered underneath Tintoretto's Paradise when this was taken down for conservation in 1903.Steer, John (1970), Venetian painting: A concise history, pp. 28-29, London: Thames and Hudson. Surviving works on panel include the Coronation of the Virgin altarpiece, dated to 1344 (Pasadena, Norton Simon Museum of Art); the Madonna of Humility dated to the 1340s (Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty Museum); the Madonna and Child from the 1360s (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art); and the Ascension of Christ of 1344 (Venice, Collezione Vittorio Cini). Guariento is generally viewed as the first artist to successfully combine the volumetric and spatial developments of Florentine painting of the early trecento with the more linear and abstract Late Gothic and Byzantine manner that had hitherto prevailed in the Veneto.

Cranebrook is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. It is surrounded by the rural suburbs of Castlereagh, Llandilo and Londonderry and has come to incorporate the Mount Pleasant housing estate, long regarded as a separate suburb. History Cranebrook takes its name from a pioneer farmer, James McCarthy, who was granted 100 acres (400,000 m²) of land in 1804 and named it \\"Crane Brook farm\\", after the abundance of cranes in the area. James McCarthy started a cemetery in 1804. After his four-year-old daughter died, he set aside some land to bury her in what became one of the first Catholic cemeteries in Australia. Penrith Local Suburb Profiles Cranebrook Post Office opened on 1 August 1886, closed in 1929, re-opened in 1934 and closed in 1957. Geography Cranebrook's geography is hilly and many residents on the western side enjoy views across the Nepean River to the Blue Mountains. Residents on the eastern side enjoy views across the ADI Site, an area rich in Cumberland Woodland and populated with many kangaroos. The Northern Road separates Cranebrook (to the west) from the ADI Site (to the east), an area of land around 15 square kilometres in size. Aspects relating to the sale and development of this land have been a strong local political issue. The southern boundary of Cranebrook is Andrews Road, and the northern boundary is Smeeton Road. Nearby is McCarthys Lane Cemetery, considered the oldest Catholic cemetery in Australia. Castlereagh Road and Church Street form the western boundary. =Penrith Lakes= West of Castlereagh Rd are the Penrith Lakes, a series of flooded quarries. The quarries were formed by a quarrying conglomerate in 1979. The site supplies around 75% of Sydney's sand and crushed aggregate requirements, including about 85% of the materials for ready mixed concrete. One of these lakes is the Sydney International Regatta Centre which hosted the rowing events of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. There is also the popular Penrith Whitewater Stadium which hosted whitewater slalom events for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. The Penrith Lakes Development Corporation (PLDC) oversees implementation of the Penrith Lakes Scheme. It is a popular misconception that these lakes are filled via the Nepean River but they are actually filled via rain water and ground water. When the Nepean River floods, the lakes system can act as a weir. A Penrith Lakes Scheme Concept Planpenrithlakes.com.au is currently under review to ensure the site delivers a wide range of environmental, social, cultural and economic values. PLDC has established a community advisory committee (CAC) which will meet regularly and provide advice on the ongoing planning and development of the lakes scheme. The lakes were also a film location for Mad Max: Fury Road. Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 15,759 people in Cranebrook. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 5.2% of the population. * The median age of people in Cranebrook was 32, younger than the national median of 38. * 79.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.4%, New Zealand 1.7%, Philippines 0.8% and India 0.7%. * 86.1% of people only spoke English at home.

Commercial area The main commercial area of Cranebrook is on Borrowdale Way which features a shopping centre and some parkland. Transport Residents of Cranebrook can access Penrith by travelling south on The Northern Road or Castlereagh Road. The trip by car is about 10 minutes. Residents can also travel to Windsor and Richmond to the north, which are about 10–15 minutes by car. The distance to the Sydney CBD is 65 km and this is best travelled by either driving down The Northern Road to the M4 Motorway or taking a train from Penrith Railway Station. Cranebrook itself has no train station (the nearest station is Penrith); however, the area is serviced by buses which can take residents into Penrith. Schools The three public primary schools are Braddock Public School, Henry Fulton Public School and Samuel Terry Public School. The local public high school is Cranebrook High School. At one point Xavier College was based in Cranebrook, while construction of its permanent site in Llandilo was developed. The Catholic primary school is Corpus Christi, located in northern Cranebrook. A non- denominational Christian private school, St Paul's Grammar School, offers the IB Diploma Programme. Churches There are two churches in Cranebrook: Corpus Christi Catholic Church on Andromeda Drive and St Thomas's Anglican Church on Callisto Drive. Housing Cranebrook is a largely residential area. It contains mostly medium-density housing and some low-density semi- rural housing towards the north. Whilst some of the semi-rural areas would date to when Cranebrook was first founded, much of the medium-density development has occurred within just the last 15 years. Even today there is a regular new home construction. As such, the population is typically local families, many of whom are home-owners or aspiring home-owners. There are some units and semi-detached houses in the Mount Pleasant area, though the majority are detached with good size house blocks, well kept gardens and abundant mature native trees. In 2010, the swamplands in the south-western corner of Cranebrook were developed into a 53.3ha housing community named Waterside. The development includes 694 high-density dwellings, lakes and parklands. Shortly after the Waterside development completed, a new development east of Cranebrook was established. Jordan Springs is located in 229ha of former Australian Defence Industry land and shares a boundary with Cranebrook via The Northern Road. Politics The state government electorates are Londonderry and Penrith. It is in the North Ward of the local government area of the City of Penrith. The Aboriginal district is the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council Area.

The angular notches on the edges of the forewings are characteristic of the genus Polygonia, which is why species in the genus are commonly referred to as anglewing butterflies. Comma butterflies can be identified by their prominent orange and dark brown/black dorsal wings. To reduce predation, both the larval and adult stages exhibit protective camouflage, mimicking bird droppings and fallen leaves, respectively. During the later stage of development, the larvae also develop strong spines along their backs. The species is commonly found in Europe, North Africa, and Asia, and contains several subspecies. Although the species is not migratory, the butterflies are strong fliers, resulting in an open population structure with high gene flow and increased genetic variation. Description The outer margins of the wings are strongly and irregularly dentate, excavated and angulated. The upper side of the wings has a bright orange ground colour, decorated with brown marks and light spots on the edge. The reverse is marbled with brown. Folded, the butterfly looks like a dead leaf. The hindwings have on the reverse side a white spot usually in the shape of C. The sexual dimorphism is slight and concerns the intensity of the coloration, the silhouette and the size, the male having a wingspan of 22 to 24 mm. and the female of 25 to 26 mm. The seasonal dimorphism is more marked: the first generation ( hutchinsoni form, May-June) has the upperside fawn orange and the underside brown-gold and the hindwing bears distally a broad dark red-brown area in which is situated a row of light brown hastate spots, the underside is dark, being either unicolorous or prominently marmorated. , while the second generation (form c-album (July, in autumn and spring after overwintering) has a more reddish upper and dark brown underside (ground- colour is less bright). In the summer-form the wings are less dentate, and the hindwing has a narrow dark submarginal band, near which stands a row of light lunules proximally bordered by a band of brown arcs; the underside is of a paler colour, being less distinctly — sometimes, however, very prominently — marmorated and shaded.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  The comma belongs to the family Nymphalidae, the largest family of butterflies with 13 subfamilies. Within the genus Polygonia, a sister-group relationship between P. c-album and P. faunus is strongly supported by larval development analysis and synapomorphies. In both species, the adults and larvae have similar polyphagous habits. The genus Polygonia is also closely related to the genera Kanisha and Roddia, each containing a single species: K. canace and R. l-album.  Geographic range and habitat  The comma inhabits areas including Europe, North Africa, and Asia. It is primarily a woodland butterfly, living in low-density forests with sunshine and moist soil. Specifically, the species is commonly found in the woodland, country lanes, and garden areas of Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain.UK Safari As a food generalist, or polyphagous species, comma butterflies can feed upon a variety of host plants, leading to widespread ranges across continents. In response to climate change, they are also undergoing range expansion. = Subspecies = Form hutchinsoni (named for Emma Hutchinson) Northamptonshire, UK The following subspecies are found in the indicated parts of the comma's range: * P. c. c-album Europe * P. c. imperfecta (Blachier, 1908) North Africa * P. c. extensa (Leech, 1892) western China, central China * P. c. kultukensis (Kleinschmidt, 1929) Transbaikalia * P. c. hamigera (Butler, 1877) Ussuri (type locality Edo, Japan) * P. c. koreana (Bryk, 1946) Korea * P. c. sachalinensis (Matsumura, 1915) Sakhalin * P. c. asakurai (Nakahara, 1920) Taiwan * P. c. agnicula (Moore, 1872) Nepal [4]  Food resources  Larval host plant preferences and selection = For comma butterflies, food resources consumed during development are the primary source of nitrogen and protein during adulthood. Because they feed exclusively on plants, making them a phytophagous species, the quality of plants upon which the larvae feed is strongly correlated with their future fitness. The larval form is often divided into five developmental stages known as instars. Although during the first three instars larvae are observed to remain almost entirely upon the underside of leaves, the fourth and fifth instar larvae are more active in obtaining food resources. The later instar larvae are specialized feeders and favor several host plants during the larval stage: Urtica dioica, Ulmus glabra, Salix caprea, R. uva-crispa, and Betula pubescens. While pupal weight and overall larval survival rates are similar among larvae regardless of host plant, the larval development times differ significantly. As a result, larvae prefer feeding on plants that allow them to develop in the shortest amount of time. Larvae reared on U. dioica demand the shortest development time and is thus favored over other plants. On the other hand, B. pubescens is at the bottom of the host plant preference hierarchy. Favoring plants in the family Urticaceae is speculated to have originated from the species’ ancestors, providing an explanation for larval preference for U. dioica. Within the U. dioica plant, larvae are not shown to differentiate between high quality (fresher) and low quality (wilting) nettles, a pattern expected of a polyphagous species. File:Nettle - Ortica - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg Urtica dioica File:Ulmus glabra - 1.jpg Ulmus glabra File:Salix caprea.jpg Salix caprea  Reproduction and life history  Mating = Mating system  Comma butterflies have a polyandrous mating system where females mate with multiple males to receive the necessary amount of sperm to fertilize their eggs. The polyandrous female distributes her matings equally over her lifetime, so males' mating success increases proportionally to their lifespan. The mating success of both sexes is correlated to the duration of an individual's life, so no difference in mortality rates is observed between males and females.  Female mate choice  Females exercise mate choice before, during, and after mating and can distinguish between males who were reared on high-quality versus low-quality host plants. The ability to recognize adults reared on higher quality host plants is selected for because males fed better plants during development provide superior nuptial gifts. In comma butterflies, nuptial gifts are edible spermatophores containing spermatozoa and nutrients. When comparing the two common host plants U. dioica and S. caprea, females preferentially choose to mate with males reared on U. dioica, because these males have higher protein content and increased spermatophore production. Females preferentially mate with males which provide larger investments, in the form of nuptial gifts. When females mated with males with higher-quality nuptial gifts, they not only allocate more resources to egg production but also use the resources to improve their own reproductive success. The investments can be used to increase female life expectancy, female maintenance, and future reproduction. During each mating, males allocate a constant amount of investment towards each nuptial gift, indicating that male mate choice does not play a role in allocation of resources. = Oviposition = Females recognize and select a host plant carefully before laying their eggs upon it, generally favoring host plants where larval development time is minimized. Akin to the preferred host plants for larvae, females prefer plants in the order Urticales. Despite the overall preference for plants leading to short larval development, host plant preference variation between females exists. Although the partiality for certain plant species appears to be inherited across populations, the pattern is not significant within a single population. This pattern of deviation results from the open population structure with high gene flow. = Parent- offspring conflict = In theory, females would prefer host plants where their offspring performance is maximized, and the larvae would benefit from being able to feed on the best resources nearby their hatch site. However, this is not always observed in nature due to external factors such as predators, parasites, and pathogens. Instead, there is a trade-off between female host plant preference and larval fitness in many species of butterfly. In P. c-album, instead of accepting the host plant that the female selected, first instar larvae leave their hatch site in search of alternative food sources. Larvae that stay on the inferior host are not only smaller, but also have lower survival and growth rates. = Egg mass = Unlike female host plant preference, egg mass is not shown to be sex-linked. Instead, egg mass is most likely controlled by additive autosomal genes, where the egg sizes of offspring are intermediate compared to its parents. The type of host plant chosen during the larval stage is not correlated with their offspring's egg mass, indicating that egg size is not related to fitness. = Life history = Egg  Egg  Females lay their eggs on a variety of host plants, preferring those that minimize larval development time. Unlike some butterflies who lay their eggs in batches, comma females often lay their eggs singly. After each egg is laid, the female scouts out other possible host plants before determining the site of her next egg. The eggs are green when first laid, and gradually turn yellow and ultimately grey before hatching,[2] which generally takes four to five days. Although the female can allocate more resources into egg production based on the nuptial gifts received by mates, the total number of eggs laid or the mass of the eggs are altered based on the host plant. A lack of correlation suggests that neither egg quantity nor egg mass indicate future fitness for the offspring.  Larva  Larva The larval period is separated into five distinct stages or instars. During the first three instars, the comma larvae have a cryptic appearance to avoid detection while they primarily stay on the underside of leaves. Fourth and fifth instar larvae search for food more actively. However, the beginning of the fourth instar also marks the development of black, white, and orange patterns. To avoid predation despite its conspicuous appearance, the larva develops strong spines along its body. The larvae have a continuous white marking along their backs to mimic bird droppings. In its final instar, the white colouration disappears but the spines persist. Three possibilities describing why spines may develop during later instars are as follows: smaller larvae cannot sustain the spines, larger larvae benefit more from spines as their predators shift from invertebrates to vertebrates, or because an effective spine pattern cannot be achieved upon the surface area of the smaller larvae. Aside from the formation of spines, no other defence against predators appears to be present. While fourth and fifth instar larvae are rarely preyed upon by the same predator, removal of the spines leads to repeated predation, indicating that no chemical defence mechanism exists to deter enemies.  Pupa  Pupa P. c-album adults undergo one of two morphs: the directly developing morph or the diapausing (delayed development) morph. For both males and females, directly developing adults have a shorter pupal time of around 10 days, whereas the diapausing adults spend over 11 days pupating. Additionally, the pupae whose adult stage would enter the directly developing morph had larger pupal weights, consistent with the notion that the lighter morph allocates more resources towards maturation and reproduction.  Adult  Full-grown comma butterflies have a wingspan of about 45 mm or 1.8 inches. The name comma butterfly derives from the small white 'C'-shaped marking resembling a comma on the underside of its wings. Commas can exhibit both mimicking and polyphenism, a phenomenon where multiple morphs exist in a population. Due to their orange and dark brown/black appearance, the butterflies resemble fallen leaves when their wings are closed. Adults can also undergo one of two morphs: the directly developing morph or the diapausing morph. During the directly developing morph, the butterflies mature sexually at a rapid rate. Females undergoing this morph oviposit in the summer, leading the phase to also be referred to as the summer morph. Butterflies portraying the summer morph have light coloured undersides. The diapausing morph, also known as the spring or winter morph, occurs when the female enters a reproductive diapause, a time when sexual maturity is postponed, and hibernates before ovipositing in the spring instead. During the diapausing morph, the undersides of the wings are much darker.

P. vanessae often oviposit in the larvae of butterflies such as P. c-album and Nymphalis antiopa. = Diseases = P. c-album are known to be infected by cytoplasmic virus diseases. The disease infection usually starts in the cytoplasm of the midgut and progresses throughout the foregut and hindgut as well. = Antipredator adaptations = Larva  The first three larval instars are camouflaged, the dark colours making the larvae less vulnerable to detection. In the fourth instar, the appearance of the larval body is relatively more colourful with white, black, and orange aposematic patterns. A white stripe along its back mimics the pattern of bird droppings, further displaying protective colouration of the species. During the transition between the third and fourth instars, the larvae also develop strong spines along their backs. Decreased predation by birds on P. c-album third-instar larvae has been shown compared to other larval stages, indicating that the spines increase defence. However, this appears to provide limited protection as some birds were able to consume the larvae despite the appearance of spikes.  Adult  Adults also make use of camouflage. The underside of adult wings mimic the patterns of a fallen leaf. The similarity is further exaggerated by the irregular wing edges, not resembling a typical butterfly, that are characteristic of the genus Polygonia. The butterflies can also undergo one of two morphs: directly developing (summer) or diapausing (spring/winter). The diapausing morph is triggered when resources are allocated to survival, resulting in a less conspicuous, darker appearance of adults to avoid predation.  Physiology  Diapause = Under cold winter conditions, adults can undergo diapause, a period of delayed sexual maturation to maximize survival. The diapause morph is based upon the length of the day that the larvae experienced during the development stage of the life cycle. The diapausing morph is more commonly observed in P. c-album butterflies inhabiting south Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The threshold for the photoperiod triggering diapause is primarily due to autosomal genes but may also be influenced by sex-linked genes and/or parental effects. Females tend to enter a diapause based on a photoperiod that is intermediate to the parents, and males are more likely to enter diapause than females. This indicates that males and females have evolved different optimal lifecycles. Females profit from larger body size, because it is correlated with fecundity whereas male fitness is not related to size. = Thermoregulation = Although dark appearances such as the early instars and the diapause morph are commonly seen in species as a means of thermoregulation, the behaviour of commas makes the theory unlikely for this species. During the first three instars, the cryptically coloured larvae spend most of their time under leaves, limiting their exposure to the sun. Although the later instar larvae are more dispersive in search of food resources, basking is very rarely observed. Thus, their body temperatures do not elevate dramatically in the presence of sunshine, decreasing the effect that dark exteriors customarily have on biological processes such as metabolism and development rate. However, P. c-album larvae are observed basking during the two later instars. This may be explained by the resemblance that the later instar larvae have to bird droppings, which would limit predation despite increasing exposure to predators. Thermoregulatory behaviours may have a much more pronounced effect on later instar larvae but do not appear to affect the first three larval stages. = Polyphenism = Comma adults are dimorphic. The two phases are the directly developing morph (summer morph) and the diapausing morph (winter/spring morph). The two morphs are determined by autosomal genes, which determine which phase the adults will undergo based on the length of the day experienced during the larval stage. During winter, the length of the day is short, and butterfly survival rate is lower. To allow the adults to survive through the cold winter and oviposit during the spring, the adults go through the diapausing morph which feature darker wings for greater protective colouration during hibernation. When the photoperiods are longer during summertime, the adults go through the directly developing phase with a lighter appearance. The lighter appearance is attributed to fewer resources allocated to producing a protective appearance and more resources used to assist reproduction.  Interactions with humans  Climate change = Climate change has dramatically affected the habitat ranges of the comma, encouraging range expansion and feeding upon a wider variety of host plants. In Britain, comma butterflies have shown the greatest shift in habitat and feeding resources, altering its preferred host plant from H. lupulus to U. glabra and U. dioica. The movement of the distribution appears to be following a change in climate. Although not a migrating butterfly species, the butterflies at the edges of the range show much higher dispersal tendencies than those living within the range. = Population change = In the 19th century, the British population of the comma crashed,Comma page at UK Butterflies possibly as a result of reduced hop (H. lupulus) farming. From about 1930 the population recovered, and the comma is now one of the more familiar butterflies in Southern England. It is also found in Scotland and in North Wales.Comma page at Butterfly Conservation site Since the 1970s in Britain, specialist butterflies have decreased in population as their preferred habitat and host plants area becomes smaller. On the other hand, generalist species such as P. c-album have started to expand their range. In particular, comma butterflies have expanded along the northern edge of their range.

Situated in the fifth (cinquième) arrondissement of Paris, Rue Mouffetard is one of Paris's oldest and liveliest neighbourhoods. These days the area has many restaurants, shops, and cafés, and a regular open market. It is centered on the Place de la Contrescarpe, at the junction of the rue Mouffetard and the rue de Lacepede. Its southern terminus is at the Square Saint-Médard where there is a permanent open-air market. At its northern terminus, it becomes the rue Descartes at the crossing of the rue Thouin. It is closed to normal motor traffic much of the week, and is predominantly a pedestrian avenue. Origin of the name The rue Mouffetard runs along a flank of the mont Sainte- Geneviève hill that was called \\"mont Cétarius\\" or \\"mont Cetardus\\" from Roman times; many historians consider \\"Mouffetard\\" to be a derivation of this early name. Over the centuries the rue Mouffetard has appeared as rue Montfétard, Maufetard, Mofetard, Moufetard, Mouflard, Moufetard, Moftard, Mostard, and also rue Saint-Marcel, rue du Faubourg Saint-Marceau (\\"street of the suburb Saint-Marceau\\") and rue de la Vieille Ville Saint-Marcel (\\"old town Saint- Marcel street\\").  History  The origins of this thoroughfare are ancient, dating back to Neolithic times. As with today's rue Galande, rue Lagrange, rue de la Montagne Sainte-Geneviève and rue Descartes, it was a Roman road running from the Roman Rive Gauche city south to Italy. From the Middle Ages a church along this section of roadway became centre of a \\"bourg Saint-Médard\\" (Saint- Médard village), and from 1724 was integrated into Paris as the main artery of the \\"Faubourg Saint Médard\\". The Diderot family moved at #6 rue Mouffetard in April 1746, where lived also François-Jacques Guillotte, a police officer who wrote an article (Pont militaire) for the Encyclopédie by Diderot. The area remained relatively unchanged because of its location on the Montagne Sainte- Geneviève, which protected it from Baron Haussmann's redevelopment during the reign of Napoleon III.

Early life  Farewell was born at Holbrook House near Wincanton in the Blackmore Vale in 1784. His father was the Reverend Samuel Farewell, who died when Francis was young. Francis and the rest of the Farewell family then moved from Holbrook to Tiverton, Devon. There he became a scholar at Blundell's School until the age of 13, when he left to become a midshipman in the Royal Navy. He first served aboard HMS Amphion, and when that vessel was decommissioned in 1811, Farewell was first transferred to HMS Thisbe and then to HMS Bacchante. Farewell fought against the French in the Napoleonic Wars, including the Battle of Lissa, and he was wounded in several engagements. He ended his service with the rank of lieutenant.  Cape Colony and Natal  After the war, Farewell entered the merchant marine, commanding merchant vessels on the South American and Indian trade routes. In 1820, Farewell arrived in Cape Town in the Cape Colony as the managing owner of the merchant vessel Frances Charlotte. In 1822, he married Elizabeth Caterina Schmidt, the step-daughter of a Cape Town merchant. In 1823, Farewell was a partner in The Farewell Trading company, which aimed to establish an ivory trade in Natal. In June 1823, Farewell sailed aboard the brig Salisbury as part of the company's first expedition to Natal. Farewell almost drowned in the surf when a landing attempt was made at St. Lucia, but was rescued by a native interpreter. After five weeks at St. Lucia, the expedition headed to Algoa Bay to replenish supplies before heading on to Port Natal, where it was determined a settlement could be established. Farewell returned to Port Natal in 1824 with a small group of thirty settlers—twenty Boers and ten Englishmen. Farewell also had employed three Khoikhoi servants, and he owned one of the settlement's two support ships, the sloop Julia. In late 1824, Farewell asked for Shaka's permission to establish a trading post in Natal. Shaka agreed, and Farewell established Port Natal as a place for ships travelling to India to stop at, and also for Farewell to trade with the Zulus for ivory.  Death  In 1829 Farewell set out for Natal from Port Elizabeth, heading overland with a wagon train loaded with two and a half tons of beads for trade with the Zulus, who were now led by King Dingane, Shaka's half-brother and a conspirator in Shaka's assassination the year before. Farewell was accompanied by Thackwray, a trader, and Walker, a naturalist. When Farewell's wagon train reached the vicinity of the kraal of Qwabe chief Nqetho, he halted the wagon train and set off to visit the chief accompanied by Thackwray, Walker, and eight Zulu and Khoikhoi servants, leaving fellow Port Natal settler John Cane in charge of the wagons. After being received with what Donald R. Morris described as \\"apparent kindness\\" by Nqetho, Farewell, Thackwray, and Walker set up camp outside the kraal while their servants slept in huts located in the kraal. Before they retired for the night, the servants informed Farewell that Nqetho was not to be trusted, and that the atmosphere inside the kraal was tense, but Farewell ignored them. During the night, Lynx, one of Farewell's servants, slipped out of the kraal to warn Farewell that Nqetho was plotting the deaths of Farewell and his party. Nqetho had recently quarreled with Dingane and considered him an enemy, and was not sympathetic towards Farewell due to his trading with Dingane. He also assumed one of Farewell's Zulu servants, who was the son of a Zulu chief, was a spy. Instead of heeding Lynx's warning, Farewell called Lynx a coward and went back to sleep. Just before dawn, Qwabe warriors approached Farewell's tent, cut its ropes, and stabbed Farewell and his comrades through the canvas, killing all three of them. Lynx, who had armed himself with a musket and was keeping watch, kicked his companions awake upon hearing the assault on Farewell's tent and led them from the kraal. Only Lynx and two others survived to reach the wagon train, but Lynx killed three of their pursuers, despite being wounded several times himself. Lynx informed Cane of Farewell's fate, and Cane promptly led the rest of the servants into the bush to elude the Qwabe warriors who soon reached the train and ransacked the wagons, killing all the horses and oxen and taking all of the beads. Cane returned to Grahamstown to reequip, bringing Farewell's ill-fated overland journey to a close.

It is a hamlet of Duino-Aurisina, a municipality (comune) of the Province of Trieste in the Friuli–Venezia Giulia region of northeastern Italy. The settlement, picturesquely situated on the steep Karst cliffs of the Gulf of Trieste, is known for Duino Castle, perpetuated by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke in his Duino Elegies. Name Duino was attested in historical sources as Duino in 1139, Dewin in the 13th century, and Tybein 1370, among various other forms of the name. Although equivalents of the Slovene name appear in various Slavic languages (cf. Slovak Devín, Polish Dziewin, etc., all ultimately derived from Slavic *děva 'girl'), the name of this settlement is not originally Slavic. Instead, it derives from Romance tubīnum < Latin tubus '(water) pipe'. History Old Castle ruins The Lords of Duino, vassals of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, were first mentioned about 1150. From their ancestral seat, located on a rock high above the Adriatic Sea, they controlled the trade routes running from the city of Monfalcone along the coast to the Istrian peninsula. Serving as ministeriales of the Counts of Gorizia and also of their successors, the Habsburg archdukes of Inner Austria, they secured their position in the Friuli region. Their Old Castle is today in ruins, while the newer Duino Castle, dating back to 1389, is inhabited to this day and can be visited by tourists. Below the ruins of the ancient castle there lies a white rock projecting into the sea, the Dama Bianca, which resembles a veiled woman and gave origin to many gothic legends. Held by the descendants of the Della Torre (Thurn) noble family from the 16th century onwards, the estates were inherited by Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855–1934) in 1893. A patron of the arts and socialite, she accommodated Rainer Maria Rilke at Duino Castle from 1911 to 1912 and he dedicated his Duino Elegies to her. By the late 19th century, Duino with its scenic views and Mediterranean climate had become a fashionable seaside resort on the Austrian Riviera. Notable guests included Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Empress Elisabeth, Archduke Maximilian I, his consort Charlotte, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, as well as Eleonora Duse, Franz Liszt, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Paul Valéry, Mark Twain, and Victor Hugo. Coastline, view from the Rilke trail After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Duino became part of the Kingdom of Italy. It was merged into the municipality of Duino-Aurisina in 1928. Until the 1950s, Duino was a predominantly Slovene-speaking village with a sizeable Italian-speaking minority. According to the last Austrian census of 1910, 63.5% of the inhabitants of the town were Slovenes and 25.1% were Italians (the rest were either German speakers or foreign citizens).http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:836 The Italian census of 1921 confirmed the Slovene ethnic character of the town, and even showed an increase of the proportion of Slovene speaking population to 78.4% (mostly as the result of the emigration of Austrians and Germans residing in the town).Oko Trsta (Belgrade: DIZ, 1945), 157 During the years of the Free Territory of Trieste (1947–1954), however, its ethnic composition changed considerably, as many Istrian Italians fleeing from Yugoslavia settled in Duino. Nowadays, Duino is a predominantly Italian-speaking town, with a numerous Slovene-speaking minority. Most signs are written in both languages, and the municipality of Duino-Aurisina is an officially bilingual one. Since 1982 the town has been home to UWC Adriatic, an international school attended by students from 80 different countries, and one of the 17 UWCs around the world. Notable people Notable natives and residents include the Slovenian economist Ivan Ples (1886–1958), composer Hrabroslav Volarič (1863–1895), and the Italian Jesuit philologist Gregorio Alasia de Sommaripa (1587–1626), who compiled the first Italian-Slovene dictionary in 1601. Duino is noted for being the place where the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann committed suicide in 1906. It is also the place where the well-known Slovene folk legend Lepa Vida takes place.http://www.kam.si/izleti/devin_na_skrajnem_severu_sredozemlja.html See also *Aurisina *Sistiana *County of Gorizia and Gradisca *Austrian Littoral ReferencesExternal links * Official Website of the Municipality Duino-Aurisina (Italian, Slovenian) * Traveller's Guide to Duino and Sistiana * Chamber of Commerce of Trieste - Duino-Aurisina * United World College of the Adriatic - Duino Category:Frazioni of the Province of Trieste Category:Former municipalities of Friuli-Venezia Giulia ","title":"Duino"},{"id":"1626652","text":"Barthélemy Thimonnier (19 August 1793 in L'Arbresle, Rhône - 5 July 1857 in Amplepuis) was a French inventor, who is attributed with the invention of the first sewing machine that replicated sewing by hand. Early life In 1795, his family moved to Amplepuis. Thimonnier was the eldest of seven children. He studied for a while in Lyon, before going to work as a tailor in Panissières. Barthelemy Thimonnier married an embroideress in January 1822. In 1823, he settled in a suburb of Saint-Étienne and worked as a tailor there. Invention of the sewing machine A copy of Barthélemy Thimonnier's sewing machine from about 1830. In 1829, he invented the sewing machine and in 1830 he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a mining engineer, who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The patent for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830 in the names of both men, supported by the French government. The same year, he opened (with partners) the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world. It was supposed to create army uniforms. However, the factory was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing work following the issuing of the patent. (See also: Luddite) A model of the machine is exhibited at the London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The earliest sewing machine was actually patented by Thomas Saint in 1790. So Thimonnier's machine was not the first. Saint's contribution was not made public until 1874 when William Newton Wilson, himself a sewing machine manufacturer, found the drawings in the London Patent Office and built a machine which worked following some adjustments to the looper. So, in 1790 Thomas Saint had invented a machine with an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for the short lengths of leather he intended it for), a vertical needle bar and a looper. The London Science Museum has the model that Wilson built from Saint's drawings. Later life Thimonnier then returned to Amplepuis and supported himself as a tailor again, while searching for improvements to his machine. He obtained new patents in 1841, 1845, and 1847 for new models of sewing machine. However, despite having won prizes at World Fairs, and being praised by the press, use of the machine did not spread. Thimonnier's financial situation remained difficult, and he died in poverty at the age of 63. The Thimonnier sewing machine company, created after his death, existed up to the 20th century.

It is also done to remove a normal healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor, when part of a kidney transplant procedure. History The first recorded nephrectomy was performed in 1861 by Erastus Bradley Wolcott in Wisconsin. The patient had been suffering from a large tumor and the operation was initially successful, but the patient died fifteen days later. The first planned nephrectomy was performed by the German surgeon Gustav Simon on August 2, 1869 in Heidelberg. Simon practiced the operation beforehand in animal experiments. He proved that one healthy kidney can be sufficient for urine excretion in humans. Indications There are various indications for this procedure, including renal cell carcinoma, a non-functioning kidney (which may cause high blood pressure) and a congenitally small kidney (in which the kidney is swelling, causing it to press on nerves which can cause pain in unrelated areas such as the back). Nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma is rapidly being modified to allow partial removal of the kidney. Nephrectomy is also performed for the purpose of living donor kidney transplantation. A nephroureterectomy is the removal of a kidney and the entire ureter and a small cuff of the bladder for urothelial cancer of the kidney or ureter.\\"Laparoscopic (keyhole) removal of the whole kidney and ureter: Information about your procedure from The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS). British Association of Urological Surgeons, No. 17/063 (May 2017), pp. 1-8. Procedure Laparoscopic nephrectomy The surgery is performed with the patient under general anesthesia. A kidney can be removed through an open incision or laparoscopically. For the open procedure, the surgeon makes an incision in the side of the abdomen to reach the kidney. Depending on circumstances, the incision can also be made midline. The ureter and blood vessels are disconnected, and the kidney is then removed. The laparoscopic approach utilizes three or four small (5–10 mm) cuts in the abdominal and flank area. The kidney is completely detached inside the body and then placed in a bag. One of the incisions is then expanded to remove the kidney for cancer operations. If the kidney is being removed for other causes, it can be morcellated and removed through the small incisions. Recently, this procedure is performed through a single incision in the patient's navel. This advanced technique is called single port laparoscopy. For some illnesses, there are alternatives today that do not require the extraction of a kidney. Such alternatives include renal embolization for those who are poor candidates for surgery, or partial nephrectomy if possible. Occasionally renal cell cancers can involve adjacent organs, including the IVC, the colon, the pancreas or the liver. If the cancer has not spread to distant sites, it may be safely and completely removed surgically via open or laparoscopic techniques. = Kidney donation = In January 2009, a woman who had previously had a hysterectomy was able to donate a kidney and have it removed through her vagina. The operation took place at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. This is the first time a healthy kidney has been removed via this method, though it has been done in the past for nephrectomies carried out due to pathology. Removing organs through orifices prevents some of the pain of an incision and the need for a cosmetically unappealing larger scar. Any advance which leads to a decrease in pain and scarring has the potential to boost donor numbers.Donor kidney removed via vagina, BBC News, 3 February 2009 This operation has also taken place at the Cleveland Clinic, which first performed transvaginal Nephrectomy. Living donation has a mortality risk of 0.03% during the procedure and seems to result in similar health outcomes to controls. After care Pain medication is often given to the patient after the surgery because of pain at the site of the incision. An IV with fluids is administered. Electrolyte balance and fluids are carefully monitored, because these are the functions of the kidneys. It is possible that the remaining kidney does not take over all functionality. A patient has to stay in the hospital between 2 and 7 days depending on the procedure and complications. Patients who have had open surgery will have to stay in hospital longer than those who have had laparoscopic surgery. In long-term, a person with only one kidney (\\"solitary kidney\\") may be more prone to developing chronic kidney disease. A 2014 study suggested that lifelong risk of chronic kidney disease is several-fold higher in kidney donors, although the absolute risk is still very small. A 2017 article in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that persons with only one kidney including those who have donated a kidney for transplantation or those whose kidney was removed for cancer, should avoid high protein diet and limit their protein intake to less than one gram per kilogram body weight per day in order to reduce the long-term risk of chronic kidney disease.  Partial nephrectomy  Partial nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney tumor along with a thin rim of normal kidney, with the two aims of curing the cancer and preserving as much normal kidney as possible. = History = Czerny first described a partial nephrectomy in 1890.Czerny HE (cited by Herczel E): Ueber nierenextirpation bietr. Klin Khirurg 1890;6:485. However, due to limited x-ray and imaging capabilities to find small kidney tumors and significant complications associated with early operations it was largely abandoned. More recently, with improved imaging, improved surgical techniques and increased kidney tumor detection, partial nephrectomy is performed more often. = Indications = A partial nephrectomy should be attempted when there is a kidney tumor in a solitary kidney, when there are kidney tumors in both kidneys, or when removing the entire kidney could result in kidney failure and the need for dialysis. Partial nephrectomy is also the standard of care for nearly all patients with small renal masses (<4 cm in size). Most renal masses between 4-7 centimeters can also be treated by partial nephrectomy if they are located in the proper position. Renal masses larger than 7 centimeters are generally treated with radical nephrectomy unless the tumor occurs in a solitary kidney, there are tumors on both sides or kidney function is bad. Patients who are told their tumors are too big or too hard for a partial nephrectomy may want to seek another opinion because surgeons who take care of many patients with kidney cancer are more often able to spare the kidney than those who only see a few cases. = Procedure = A partial nephrectomy is performed with a patient under general anesthesia as well. A partial nephrectomy can be performed through an open, laparoscopic or robotic approach. The patient is typically placed on the operating room bed lying on the side opposite the kidney tumor. The goal of the procedure is to remove the kidney tumor along with a thin rim of normal kidney tissue. Because the kidneys clean the blood, all blood eventually flows through the kidneys and 25% of it will go into the kidneys with each heart beat. In order to safely remove the kidney tumor, the blood flow to the kidney is often temporarily blocked off. The tumor is then cut out and the surgeon must sew the remaining kidney back together. Partial nephrectomy is often an alternative to complete, or radical, nephrectomy for renal cell cancer. = Complications = Patients who undergo partial nephrectomy experience complications around 15-25% of the time. The most common complications are bleeding, infection and urinary leak. = Cancer control, quality of life, and survival = Partial nephrectomy offers the same chance of cure from the renal cell cancer as radical nephrectomy. This was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. Partial nephrectomy has been shown to maintain kidney function better than total removal. There is some debate whether this preservation of kidney function leads to long-term benefits to the patient. Some studies have found that patients treated by partial nephrectomy live longer than patients who had their whole kidney removed. Other studies have found the opposite. Partial nephrectomy has been associated with better quality of life compared to radical nephrectomy.

Dan Seymour, Aldo Nadi, Humphrey Bogart, Sheldon Leonard, Marcel Dalio and Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) Biography and career Sheldon Leonard Bershad was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of middle class Jewish parents Anna Levit and Frank Bershad. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1929. As an actor, Leonard specialized in playing supporting characters, especially gangsters or \\"heavies\\", in films such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946; as bartender Nick), To Have and Have Not (1944), Guys and Dolls (1955), and Open Secret (1948). His trademark was his especially thick New York accent, usually delivered from the side of his mouth. (He would often pronounce th as t and would say er as oi, thus he would pronounce earth as oit.) In Decoy (1946), Leonard uses his \\"heavy\\" persona to create the hard-boiled police detective Joe Portugal. On the radio from 1945 to 1955, Leonard played an eccentric racetrack tout on The Jack Benny Program and later in the TV series of the same name. His role was to salute Benny out of the blue in railroad stations, on street corners, or in department stores (\\"Hey Bud. C'mere a minute.\\"), ask Benny what he was about to do, and then proceed to try to argue him out of his course of action by resorting to inane and irrelevant racing logic. As \\"The Tout,\\" he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, \\"Who knows about horses?\\" Leonard was part of the cast of voice actors on the Damon Runyon Theatre radio show (1948–1949). He was part of the ensemble cast of the Martin and Lewis radio show. He also appeared frequently on The Adventures of the Saint, often playing gangsters and heavies, but also sometimes in more positive roles. Leonard was also a regular on the radio comedy series The Adventures of Maisie in the 1940s. During the 1950s, Leonard provided the voice of lazy fat cat Dodsworth in two Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoons directed by Robert McKimson. Leonard, Sheree North and Quinn Cummings in Big Eddie, 1975 In the adventure movie The Iroquois Trail (1950), Leonard played against type in the significant role of Chief Ogane, a Native American warrior, who pursues and fights the frontiersman Nat \\"Hawkeye\\" Cutler (George Montgomery) in a climactic duel to the death with knives. Later in the 1950s and 1960s, he established a reputation as a producer of successful television series, including The Danny Thomas Show (aka Make Room For Daddy) (1953–64), The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68), Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. (1964–69), The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66), and I Spy (1965–68). He also directed several TV series episodes, including four of the first eight episodes of the TV series Lassie (Season 1, 1954). Leonard also provided the voice of Linus the Lionhearted in a series of Post Crispy Critters cereal TV commercials in 1963-64, which led to a Linus cartoon series that aired on Saturday (and later, Sunday) mornings on CBS (1964–66) and ABC (1967–69). He also was briefly the star of his own television show Big Eddie (1975), where he played the owner of a large sports arena. The show lasted for only ten episodes. The character of Andy Taylor was introduced in a 1960 episode of The Danny Thomas Show, which led to the series The Andy Griffith Show. Leonard is informally credited with developing the practice of using an episode of a series as a backdoor pilot episode for new series, in which a guest star is introduced as a new character with the intention of using this character as the basis for a new show. He was the executive producer on Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., and had an appearance on the show as a Hollywood producer who has to do 34 takes on a movie scene before Sergeant Carter gets it right (\\"A Star is Not Born\\"). Leonard also has the distinction (along with author Mickey Spillane) of being one of the first two Miller Lite spokesmen. Using his trademark accent, he told the audience, \\"I was at first reluctant to try Miller Lite, but then I was persuaded to do so by my friend, Large Louis.\\" One of his last acting roles was a guest appearance on the TV series Cheers, in which he played Sid Nelson, the proprietor of \\"The Hungry Heifer,\\" Norm Peterson's favorite eating establishment. Leonard died on January 11, 1997, 6 weeks before his 90th birthday. He was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. Legacy Bill Cosby, whom Leonard cast in I Spy, described Leonard as \\"my last father\\" when he dedicated an episode of Cosby to both Leonard and his slain son Ennis Cosby. Bill Cosby also included an impersonation of Sheldon Leonard in one track of his 1966 hit comedy album Wonderfulness. The track, \\"Niagara Falls\\", describes Sheldon Leonard's honeymoon at Niagara Falls. In \\"Monkees Marooned\\", the eighth episode of the second season of The Monkees, a character named \\"Leonard Sheldon\\", and speaking with Leonard's accent, approaches Peter Tork on the street, much like \\"The Tout\\" and persuades Tork to trade his guitar for a treasure map. Leonard's name served as an eponym for the characters Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter in the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory because the writers were fans of his work.

The Indian dancer Guru Gopinath (ഗുരു ഗോപിനാഥ്‌) a well-trained Kathakali artist and his wife Thankamani Gopinath who was the first student of Mohiniyattam in Kerala Kalamandalam developed a unique structure for teaching and performing classical dance forms of India whose origins are from Kathakali. Solo, duets, dance dramas and traditional folk dances were the material they chose. Guru Gopinath and Thankamani's dance programs found traditional pieces existing side by side with those modified to present a variety of themes. Their style relied heavily on the angika abhinaya (body movements and gestures) and satvika abhinaya (facial expressions) from Kathakali. The major stance of Kathakali was changed by Gopinath to a more convenient pose that could rest well with the tribhanga concept. Another significant deviation was in aharya abhinaya (costume mode) where they adopted costumes and facial makeup to suit the role. Thus, in a dance on Jesus Christ, the dancer dressed like Christ. In social dances the artists wore the dress of labourers, peasants, folk, etc. Likewise roles of Srikrishna, king, snake charmer, hunter had the appropriate attire. For the first time Carnatic music compositions used for concerts were rendered into dance forms by Gopinath. Unlike traditional Kathakali and Mohini attam, a variety musical instruments were added to his presentations. Even though during his lifetime Guru Gopinath did not give a name to his style, after his death the movement to give his style a name gained momentum. In 1993, during the Global Conference on Guru Gopinath and Kerala Nadanam held in Trivandrum, a Sanskrit definition was given to this style by his students: Keraleeya Shaastriya Sargaathmaka Nrittham -- \\"A traditional creative dance style originating from Kerala.\\" Kerala Nadanam can be performed in three ways: Ekamga Nadanam (solo), Samgha Nadanam (group), Nataka Nadanam (dance drama enacting a story). Male-female pair dancing is a distinct style in Kerala Nadanam. So also he has extended the dance drama to five or six hours long performance called Indian ballets. Prominent artistsGuru Chandrasekharan (1916–1998) = Guru Chandrasekharan was a great Indian dancer and choreographer who was born in Trivandrum, Kerala in 1916. His father was NK Nair (Kunju Krishna Kurup), a notable oil painter. While studying at the university, he started practicing dance without informing his parents. He studied Kathakali dance under the guidance of Guru Gopinath. During that period, Gopinath received royal patronage from the Travancore palace and a dance school named Sri Chithrodaya Nartha Kalalayam was established by the government at Poojappura, Travancore. Chandrasekharan was one of the first students. After some time, Chandrasekharan learnt Kathakali under Nedumudi Narayana Kurup who was also a palace kathakali artiste. Later, he organized his own troupe and conducted performances around India. Social themes were rarely used in classical dances at the time. He has directed and choreographed several social themes in dance. In 1943, on an invitation from the government, he took his troupe to Alexandria, Egypt; the Middle East; and Italy for military entertainment as the Indian Army was engaged in World War II. At the close of the war in 1946, he again tried to go to East Asia, but the tour ended in Ceylon. He has served as a dance professor at Shantiniketan, West Bengal, as a member of the Kerala University Senate, Board of Director at Kerala Kalamandalam governing body, Advisory Committee member Malayalam Encyclopedia, visiting dance professor of Swathi Thirunal College of Music, and as a founder member of the director board of the Bala Bhavan, Trivandrum. In the late forties, at the insistence of some of his friends, he composed and presented the 'Voice of Travancore,' a political theme in dance form, which depicted the autocratic rule of the Dewan, Sir CP Ramaswamy Iyer and people's movement of resistance thereon. However, Sir CP was an admirer of Chandrasekharan's art. However, Chandrasekharan received his highest appreciation in the All India Educational Conference held at Trivandrum in 1946. According to the report: > \\"The Nataraja Thandava was presented in a remarkable manner by > Chandrasekharan. When he presented the Hunter Dance, his joy of being the > monarch of all he surveyed in the forest was vividly perceivable. He aroused > tragic sentiments to a remarkable extent while he was experiencing suicidal > agony as he was bitten by a snake. As he entered 'Ardhanareeswara,' here the > body was responding to a double call of vigour and grace. It was perhaps > more than what an Uday Shankar could do.\\" Another composition of his is 'Polinja Deepam' (the light that failed) depicting the sad end of Mahatma Gandhi, which he played in 1948. In 1949 he joined in the Viswabharathi University (Shantiniketan) as a professor of Kathakali dance. During this time, he composed and portrayed Rabindranath Tagore's famous dance dramas, Chitrangada, Chandalika, etc. in cities of North India including New Delhi and Calcutta. In Viswabharathi, he had the opportunity to get acquainted with many dance forms including those from Kandi, Bali, Burma, etc. During this period in Shantiniketan, he got acquainted with Prof. Humayun Kabir, Zakir Hussain (Former President of India) who were then frequent visitors of Shantiniketan. All these great personalities praised Chandrasekharan for his talent in performing art: \\"Chandrasekharan has great expressiveness and was able to communicate shades of feeling with subtlety and power. His sense of rhythm and dramatic interpretation marks him out as an artist of distinction.\\" Poet Harindranth Chatopadhyaya wrote to him on 21 February 1952: > \\"Courage is this that single willed, unaided lone you build and build > Which shows you have the spirits pluck, so from the heart I wish you luck.\\" SK George, a Gandhian disciple and a former director of Deenabandhu Bhavan, Shantiniketan, said about him: > \\"Sri Chandrasekharan was one of the best teachers of Art that Shantiniketan > has had and did much to rouse interest in its study among students from > various parts of the country. He delighted visitors to Shantiniketan from > all parts of the world during his stay there, by the finished technique of > his art and has received glowing testimonials from many of them, including > delegates to the World Pacifist meeting. In Gurudev's dance dramas like > 'Chandalika,' 'Chitrangada' and 'Syama' presented in Shantiniketan and > outside, he took the leading parts.\\" After a couple of years, he came back from Viswabharathi and started his own school at Trivandrum in the name Prathibha Nrithakala Kendra. During 1954, he performed Thilakkunna Mannu (Simmering Sand) that had a social theme advocating agrarian revolution. It has received wide acclamation from celebrated persons like President Rajendra Prasad and Dr. Radhakrishnan. Chandrasekharan's creative contributions include such compositions as 'Voice of Travancore,' 'Manishada,' 'Siva Thandavam,' 'Ganesh Nritham,' 'Ardhanareeswara,' 'Surya Nritham,' 'Geethopadesam,' Kalidasa's 'Kumara Sambhavam,' 'Sakunthalam,' Kumaran Asan's 'Chandala Bhikshuki,' Vallathol's 'Magdalana Maria,' 'Guruvum Sishyanum,' Vayalar's 'Ayisha,' Changampuzha's 'Ramanan' and 'Markandeyan,' 'Mohini Rugmangada,' 'Savithri,' 'Dakshayagam,' 'Ekalavyan,' 'Chilappadikaram,' Greek story 'Pygmalion,' Chinese story 'Fisherman's Revenge,' Japanese story 'Esashiyuvo' (Prapidiyan Pathalathil), Bible story 'Salome' and many more. He successfully composed and performed several ballets such as 'Sri Guruvayurappan,' 'Kumara Sambhavam,' 'Sri Ayyappan,' 'Hrishya Sringan' and 'Sri Hanuman.' He produced another ballet named Himavante Makkal (Children of the Himalayas) in 1964 on the background of the India's history, which concluded with the Chinese attack on India in 1962. After seeing it, VV Giri, then governor of Kerala, was so happy that he invited Chandrasekharan to Raj Bhavan and honored him. Here is an extract from his complimentary remarks. > \\"I am delighted to witness the performance of a dance drama based on > National Integration presented by Pratibha Nrithakala Kendra, Trivandrum, > and directed by the famous and distinguished dancer Chandrasekharan. This > play describes the various periods through which we have passed from Vedic > period up to the present day. It is a most thought provoking play and one > who attends this show will feel enthused and inspired and would strengthen > his spirit of patriotism and love of sacrifice for his country.\\" In 1965, Chandrasekharan composed an opera which was the first of its kind in Malayalam as well as in any other Indian language. The opera was based on the Mahabharata character Karnan. Chandrasekharan himself played the role of Karna while nearly hundred others took part in it, which was presented in Trivandrum for more than a month. The opera was produced by Kala Nilayam permanent Theatres. Chandrasekharan later started his own permanent stage called Prathibha Opera House and produced another opera entitled 'Bhishmar' on the Mahabharata hero which was an artistic success, but financially a flop, which forced him to withdraw from the scene partly. However, he continued his activities till 1980. At a public meeting in connection with his Shashtiabdapurthi (60th birthday) at Hassan Marrikar Hall, Trivandrum, under the chairmanship of Prof. Ayappa Panicker, he was conferred the title of 'Guru' by the public of Trivandrum. He was honoured with an award by Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy in 1976. Chandrasekharan has written several articles in periodicals about dances of India. His book on Bharatanatyam titled Natiya Nirishanam is a masterpiece: the culmination of a research work done with a Fellowship Award from the Cultural Department, government of India. Personal life Chandrasekharan married Mohanavalli Amma of Kalappurakkal family, Alangad Paravur, daughter of Gopala Panicker, assistant superintendent of police of former Travancore State. His wife took active participation in dance presentations. He died on 5 August 1998 at the age of 82.

Dawes produces a range of bikes including road, mountain bikes and tandems, but is best known for touring bikes, specifically the Galaxy and the Super Galaxy model lines. History 1951 Dawes Courier In 1906 Major Ernest Humphries and Charles F. Dawes set up the \\"Humphries and Dawes Company\\" in Birmingham, England. At first, they produced motorcycles and a few bicycles. But after twenty years, the two partners split up, with Major Humphries setting up a motorcycle manufacturer. Charles F. Dawes set up Dawes Cycles Ltd in Wharf Dale, Tyseley in 1926, with the company building to become a significant brand in the United Kingdom. Charles left the business around 1930, leaving the running to his son Wilfred P. Dawes, a former estate agent, who died in 1993. He had passed control of the business over to his son Richard Dawes in the 1970s. Primarily marketing itself a racing cycle manufacturer, Dawes made its money and impact through a combination of noted customer service (it would even undertake repairs at the factory), and a broader range of bicycles calculated to meet real working, commuting and leisure needs. The company built good frames with fine paintwork (though usually without rococo lugs), and by making many of their own components (brakes, pedals, mudguards, etc.), ensured that all the components of the finished bicycle were of high quality. Some vintage Dawes cycles have a distinctive curved seat tube that parallels the rear wheel closely, in order to reduce the wheelbase length. Dawes presented the \\"Courier\\" for the 1951 Festival of Britain, which incorporated a number of hints of the future direction for the company's bikes. Hand-built around a lightweight frame with a long wheelbase (comfortable for long-distance touring), it was equipped with a state-of-the-art ten-gear derailleur system, and was fitted with toecaps and saddlebag. This was followed into production with the more specialist \\"Windrush\\", a specific-designed touring bicycle and a direct fore-runner of the later \\"Galaxy\\". Two different Dawes Kingpin folding bicycles, an original and a later version, in folded state. The company's response to the 1960s passion for \\"unisex\\" small wheeled \\"shopping\\" bicycles was the step-framed \\"Newpin\\", with single-speed and three-speed Sturmey-Archer enclosed hub gearing systems. These were offered in both a fixed frame and separable two piece frame. It was later renamed as the \\"Kingpin\\", Newpin initially being used for the fixed frame version, and offered in a folding frame version that went through a number of developments, and is still in production . In 1971, Dawes first \\"Galaxy\\" model appeared, fitted with wide-ratio gears and Reynolds 531 tubing. The Galaxy became the benchmark in the English touring bicycle market.Chris Juden, technical office, Cyclists' Touring Club, Cycle magazine, 2001 A Giro 400 model racing bike by Dawes. It uses a Shimano chainset and carbon fibre front forks on a butted aluminium frame By the mid-1970s, the company was still family owned and producing 1000 bicycles a week. Between 1978 and 2001 the company was sold at least five times, passing through the hands of various venture capital and leisure companies. Resultantly, by the mid-1980s, the firm had 50 staff at its dilapidated Tysley factory. After being bought by ATAG of the Netherlands in 1990, the factory was closed down and production moved to Asia, while the head office moved to Castle Bromwich. In this guise it was bought by Midlands-based investment house Grove Industries in 1998 and sold to Tandem Group Plc in 2001. Present Since 2001, Dawes has been owned by Tandem Group plc, owners of Lincolnshire-based Falcon Cycles. Although Dawes bikes are no longer manufactured in the United Kingdom, the research, design and development still comes from their head office staff based in Birmingham. Dawes was one of the first companies to produce a complete single speed mountain bike, the Edge One, and continues to develop new models.

Thorp is the author of Beat the Dealer, which mathematically proved that the house advantage in blackjack could be overcome by card counting.Peter A. Griffin (1979) The Theory of Blackjack, Huntington Press, He also developed and applied effective hedge fund techniques in the financial markets, and collaborated with Claude Shannon in creating the first wearable computer. Thorp received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958, and worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1959 to 1961. He was a professor of mathematics from 1961 to 1965 at New Mexico State University, and then joined the University of California, Irvine where he was a professor of mathematics from 1965 to 1977 and a professor of mathematics and finance from 1977 to 1982. Computer-aided research in blackjack Thorp used the IBM 704 as a research tool in order to investigate the probabilities of winning while developing his blackjack game theory, which was based on the Kelly criterion, which he learned about from the 1956 paper by Kelly.Understanding Fortune’s Formula by Edward O. Thorp Copyright 2007 Quote: \\"My 1962 book Beat the Dealer explained the detailed theory and practice. The “optimal” way to bet in favorable situations was an important feature.

The mob-connected sharpie offered the young professor a deal: he would put up the money, if Thorp would put his theory to action and card-count their way to millions.

First they visited Reno and Lake Tahoe establishments where they tested Thorp's theory at the local blackjack tables. The experimental results proved successful and his theory was verified since he won $11,000 in a single weekend. Casinos now shuffle well before the end of the deck as a countermeasure to his methods. During his Las Vegas casino visits Thorp frequently used disguises such as wraparound glasses and false beards. In addition to the blackjack activities, Thorp had assembled a baccarat team which was also winning. News quickly spread throughout the gambling community, which was eager for new methods of winning, while Thorp became an instant celebrity among blackjack aficionados. Due to the great demand generated about disseminating his research results to a wider gambling audience, he wrote the book Beat the Dealer in 1966, widely considered the original card counting manual, which sold over 700,000 copies, a huge number for a specialty title which earned it a place in the New York Times bestseller list, much to the chagrin of Kimmel whose identity was thinly disguised in the book as Mr. X. Thorp's blackjack researchA favorable strategy for twenty-one. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 47 (1961), 110-112 is one of the very few examples where results from such research reached the public directly, completely bypassing the usual academic peer review process cycle. He has also stated that he considered the whole experiment an academic exercise. In addition, Thorp, while a professor of mathematics at MIT, met Claude Shannon, and took him and his wife Betty Shannon as partners on weekend forays to Las Vegas to play roulette and blackjack, at which Thorp was very successful. His team's roulette play was the first instance of using a wearable computer in a casino — something which is now illegal, as of May 30, 1985, when the Nevada devices law came into effect as an emergency measure targeting blackjack and roulette devices. The wearable computer was co-developed with Claude Shannon between 1960–61. The final operating version of the device was tested in Shannon's home lab at his basement in June 1961. His achievements have led him to become an inaugural member of the Blackjack Hall of Fame. He also devised the \\"Thorp count\\", a method for calculating the likelihood of winning in certain endgame positions in backgammon. Stock market Since the late 1960s, Thorp has used his knowledge of probability and statistics in the stock market by discovering and exploiting a number of pricing anomalies in the securities markets, and he has made a significant fortune. Thorp's first hedge fund was Princeton/Newport Partners. He is currently the President of Edward O. Thorp & Associates, based in Newport Beach, California. In May 1998, Thorp reported that his personal investments yielded an annualized 20 percent rate of return averaged over 28.5 years. Bibliography * (Autobiography) Edward O.

He directed a highly popular Latin American orchestra, had an extensive recording career and owned one of London's leading nightclubs. Early life Edmund William Ross was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad. His mother Luisa Urquart was a Venezuelan teacher, thought to be descended from indigenous Caribs, and his father, William Hope-Ross, was a mulatto of Scottish descent. He was the eldest of four children, having two sisters, Ruby and Eleanor, followed by a half-brother, Hugo. His parents separated after Hugo was born, and after various false steps Edmund was enrolled in a military academy. There he became interested in music and learned to play the euphonium and percussion. When his mother became involved with a man he loathed and had a son by him, the 17-year-old left for Caracas, Venezuela, to study at the Academy of Music under Vicente Emilio Sojo. He played drums in the city's nightclubs and in the Martial Band of Caracas as well as was soon hired by Sojo as timpanist in the new Venezuela Symphony Orchestra. As his obituary in The Guardian noted: \\"His local name, 'Edmundo Ros', launched a lasting myth that he was Venezuelan.\\" Later he received a music scholarship from the Venezuelan government of Eleazar Lopez Contreras, and, from 1937 to 1942, studied harmony, composition and orchestration at the Royal Academy of Music.\\"Ros, Edmundo\\", Grove Music Online. At the same time he was the vocalist and percussionist in Don Marino Baretto's band at the Embassy Club, and also recorded several sides as a sideman to Fats Waller, who was visiting London in 1938.  Orchestra  In August 1940, Ros formed his own orchestra, performing as Edmundo Ros and His Rumba Band in the style of Lecuona Cuban Boys directed by Armando Oréfiche. In 1941 he cut his first tracks with Parlophone, the first number being \\"Los Hijos de Buda\\". The band played regularly at the Coconut Grove club in Regent Street, attracting members of London's high society and Royal family.Pepe Luhtala, liner notes to Tropical Magic, vol 2 of Harlequin Records CD 50. These notes were based on interviews with Edmundo Ros. Ros's bands were always based in London nightclubs or restaurants. The first was the Cosmo Club in Wardour Street; then followed the St Regis Hotel, Cork Street, the Coconut Grove and the Bagatelle Restaurant, that opened the doors for Ros and high society. All the leaders of Allied Countries in World War II and the Royal Family came there to dine and listen to Edmundo's Rumba Band. At the Bagatelle a visit from Princess Elizabeth and party made his name. The future queen danced in public for the first time to Edmundo's music. By then, with his gently rhythmic style and engaging vocals, he was enormously popular with the public generally, and his orchestra was often invited to play at Buckingham Palace. By 1946 Ros owned a club, a dance school, a record company and an artistes' agency. His band grew to 16 musicians and was renamed Edmundo Ros and His Orchestra. Among his percussionists was Ginger Johnson. His number \\"The Wedding Samba\\", 1949, sold three million 78s. His album Rhythms of The South (1958) was one of the first high-quality LP stereo records: it sold a million copies. He was with Decca Records from 1944 to 1974, and altogether he made more than 800 recordings. In 1950, King George VI invited him to perform at Windsor, and he took his fiancée, the beautiful Swedish aristocrat Britt Johansen, whom he married that year. In 1951 Ros bought the \\"Coconut Grove\\" on Regent Street and in 1964 renamed it \\"Edmundo Ros's Dinner and Supper Club\\". The club became popular for ts atmosphere and music, but it closed in 1965, when legalised casino gambling had drawn away many of its best customers. During the 1950s and 1960s the Ros orchestra appeared frequently on BBC Radio, continuing into the early 1970s on Radio Two Ballroom. In the early 1960s, he collaborated with the Ted Heath orchestra on the album Heath versus Ros (Decca Phase 4 1964) that exploited the relatively new stereo recording process. The shift in musical tastes to rock bands as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones affected Ros's standing but he played on into the 1970s. In 1975, during Ros's seventh tour of Japan, his band's Musicians' Union shop steward tried to usurp Ros's authority by making arrangements with venues behind his back. Upon their return to the UK Ros organised a celebratory dinner after a BBC recording session and announced the disbanding of the orchestra. He destroyed almost all the charts (arrangement sheets), which conclusively ended the orchestra's existence. In 1994, Edmundo conducted and sang with the BBC Big Band with Strings at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. The other conductor was Stanley Black. The concert was broadcast over BBC Radio 2 and it was such a success that a Japanese recording company invited them into a recording studio in London to make yet another Edmundo Ros CD.  Affiliations and honours  Ros was initiated into the exclusive entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats on October 4, 1964. A year and a half later he was made a Freeman of the City of London, having been admitted to the Freedom of the Worshipful Company of Poulters on 5 January 1965 and subsequently clothed with the Livery of the Poulters' Company on 22 June 1965. He was a Freemason, initiated into the Chelsea Lodge No 3098 and a Founder Member and Worshipful Master of Lodge of Ascension No 7358; on retirement a member of Sprig of Acacia Lodge No 41, Javea, Spain. He became a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1991. He normally was nicknamed by fans and journalists as the King of Latin Music. In 2000, the composer Michael Nyman produced a BBC TV documentary about him entitled I Sold My Cadillac to Diana Dors, and described him as: \\"One of the few black men to have attained national recognition; he hadn't gone for 'the gorblimeys', he wanted to be a gentleman, the greatest satisfaction you can earn in England.\\" In the 2000 New Year Honours, Ros (then aged 90), was appointed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He turned 100 on 7 December 2010.  Personal life  Ros married twice: first to Britt Johansen in 1950. The first marriage produced two children, Anders Douglas and Britt Luisa. He designed and built a large house in Page Street, Mill Hill, London NW7, which he named Edritt House, after himself and his first wife. The house still stands, next to Copthall Girls' School. He married his second wife, Susan, in 1971.  Death  Ros retired and moved to Jávea, Alicante, Spain. He gave his last public performance on 8 January 1994. He died on 21 October 2011, shortly before his 101st birthday.

Financial econometrics is a branch of financial economics, in the field of economics. Areas of study include capital markets, financial institutions, corporate finance and corporate governance. Topics often revolve around asset valuation of individual stocks, bonds, derivatives, currencies and other financial instruments. It differs from other forms of econometrics because the emphasis is usually on analyzing the prices of financial assets traded at competitive, liquid markets. People working in the finance industry or researching the finance sector often use econometric techniques in a range of activities – for example, in support of portfolio management and in the valuation of securities. Financial econometrics is essential for risk management when it is important to know how often 'bad' investment outcomes are expected to occur over future days, weeks, months and years. Topics The sort of topics that financial econometricians are typically familiar with include: * analysis of high-frequency price observations * arbitrage pricing theory * asset price dynamics * optimal asset allocation * cointegration * event study * nonlinear financial models such as autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity * realized variance * fund performance analysis such as returns-based style analysis * tests of the random walk hypothesis * the capital asset pricing model * the term structure of interest rates (the yield curve) * value at risk * volatility estimation techniques such as exponential smoothing models and RiskMetrics Research community The Society for Financial Econometrics (SoFiE) is a global network of academics and practitioners dedicated to sharing research and ideas in the fast-growing field of financial econometrics. It is an independent non-profit membership organization, committed to promoting and expanding research and education by organizing and sponsoring conferences, programs and activities at the intersection of finance and econometrics, including links to macroeconomic fundamentals. SoFiE was co-founded by Robert F. Engle and Eric Ghysels. Premier-quality journals which publish financial econometrics research include Econometrica, Journal of Econometrics and Journal of Business & Economic Statistics. The Journal of Financial Econometrics has an exclusive focus on financial econometrics. It is edited by Federico Bandi and Andrew Patton, and it has a close relationship with SoFiE. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded for significant contribution to financial econometrics; in 2003 to Robert F.

It lies on the Midland Main Line. Four tracks pass through the station which has three platforms. It is currently operated by East Midlands Railway. The station has the PlusBus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving. Chesterfield is a Penalty fare station for East Midlands Railway services. History The first line into Chesterfield was the North Midland Railway from Derby to Leeds in 1840. The original station was built in a Jacobean style similar to the one at Ambergate but it was replaced in 1870 by a new one further south in the current location, when the Midland Railway built the \\"New Road\\" to Sheffield. This new station of 1870 was designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. In 1893 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, later to become the Great Central Railway, crossed under the North Midland line south, at Horns Bridge, to a station two hundred yards west of this station. In 1897, the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway arrived, crossing both North Midland and Great Central lines at Horns Bridge with a viaduct seven hundred feet long, leading to a station at West Bars, near the Market Place. Freight through the station with the Crooked Spire in the background in 1961 The line into Market Place station closed to passengers in 1951 due to problems in Bolsover Tunnel, the station remained open for goods traffic until March 1957, when it was closed completely. The station building was demolished in 1972. The Great Central station closed in March 1963 and was demolished in 1973 to make way for the town's inner relief road. The Midland station was demolished and rebuilt in 1963. Most of the buildings from 1963 were demolished in the late 1990s, shortly after privatisation. Most of the buildings on site now date from then. This station is owned by Network Rail but is operated by East Midlands Railway, which operates trains between Sheffield and London St Pancras International. The station was extensively rebuilt shortly after Midland Mainline took over its operation from British Rail in 1996. Midland Mainline lost their franchise in November 2007. The running of the station was passed to East Midlands Trains, who ran the station for nearly 12 years. Operation then passed to East Midlands Railway.https://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2019/04/10-franchise-ban-for- stagecoach-abellio.html Station layout Entrance to the station is on Crow Lane and includes a car park, taxi rank and bus stop. There is also a small car park on the other side of Crow Lane which used to be free, but which now has a parking charge. The main entrance leads to the station concourse, which was built in the late 1990s. It includes a ticket office, a newsagent, a café and a waiting room. The concourse and the waiting room both have direct access to platform 1. There is also a waiting room on platform 2, which is accessed via a tunnel, using the stairs or lift in the concourse. =Platforms and destinations= The fast lines have two large side platforms, one for each direction. These platforms are covered for around half their length. The goods lines pass around the rear of platform 2, and there is a third large platform here that serves the northbound goods line. Platform 1 is for northbound trains, calling at stations towards Sheffield, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Oxford Road, Liverpool Lime Street, Leeds, York, Doncaster, Newcastle, Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central. Platform 2 is for southbound trains, calling at stations towards London St Pancras International, Derby, Nottingham, Peterborough, Norwich, Cambridge, Leicester, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff Central, Bournemouth, Southampton, Plymouth and Penzance. Platform 3 is bidirectional and was opened in July 2010. As of May 2015, it is used by some services on the Leeds - Nottingham and Liverpool - Norwich routes at peak periods and during engineering works to reduce dependence on replacement bus services. It is located on the down slow line, backing on to Platform 2, and is long enough to accommodate a 10 car train. Platform 3 had existed in a previous incarnation decades earlier, although it was a bay platform.https://www.flickr.com/photos/31509278@N08/3151933304/in/set-72157610982922619/ Up express in 1957 Down iron ore train north of Chesterfield (Midland) in 1957 Up coke train approaching Chesterfield Midland in 1957 The building of platform 3 was originally planned for 2007/8 to go with the East Midlands North Erewash resignalling scheme and would have allowed passenger services to run on the bi-directional down slow line (goods line) from a new Chesterfield South Junction to Tapton Junction during perturbation or engineering work on the fast lines in this area. It would have also facilitated the turn back of trains at Chesterfield during the Bradway Tunnel blockade in 2008/9. Work on the platform actually began in March 2010. Services A Map of East Midlands Railway InterCity services showing the current service pattern each hour The 07:39 East Midlands Railway Master Cutler service runs to London via Derby and Leicester Mondays to Fridays providing a fast business train, arriving at London by 09:37. Typical weekday service pattern: * Northern Trains run an hourly service between Nottingham and Leeds. This service started from the December 2008 timetable change. All Northern Rail trains call at Chesterfield.GB National Rail Timetable 2016 Edition, Table 34 (Network Rail) As part of Northern Connect, this service is due to change route by the end of December 2019, with the northern terminus being extended to Bradford Interchange and running to Leeds via Wakefield Westgate rather than via Barnsley. Also as part of Northern Connect, some Sheffield-Hull trains will be extended to Dronfield and Chesterfield. * East Midlands Railway run an hourly service between Liverpool and Norwich and half-hourly service between Sheffield and London, which occasionally extends to Leeds or Scarborough. All East Midlands Railway services call at Chesterfield. * CrossCountry operate a half-hourly service from Sheffield to Derby, which continue on to a variety of final destinations; Glasgow, Edinburgh, Plymouth, Reading, Southampton Central and Bristol. Only half of these stop at Chesterfield.GB National Rail Timetable May 2016 Edition, Table 51 (Network Rail) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, there was an initial plan in July 2020 to temporarily cut all CrossCountry services from stopping at Chesterfield, but later revised to reinstate peak time services. Based on the above, there are typically 12 passenger trains per hour passing through the station on weekdays (6 in each direction), with 10 of those calling.  In popular culture  A pivotal scene in Frederick Forsyth's novel The Fourth Protocol took place at Chesterfield railway station, including on the station platform and ensuing action on nearby streets. Former stations Chesterfield was, at once served by three railway stations. The others were Chesterfield Central station and Chesterfield Market Place station. High Speed 2 High Speed 2 trains are planned to serve Chesterfield. A branch off the eastern section of the HS2 line south of Chesterfield will route via the M1 running parallel to HS2, allowing trains to continue to and through Chesterfield to Sheffield Midland station. HS2 trains will continue north of Sheffield using the Sheffield to Leeds Line to branch back onto the main HS2 line north of Sheffield. On 17 July 2017, the government confirmed a stop at Chesterfield after approval of the M18/Eastern Route.

Life Born at Maastricht, Van Hasselt was first educated at the Koninklijk Atheneum in his native town. He studied law at the Francophone University of Liège (then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands), where he earned his degree. From 1827 up to 1832 he established himself as a lawyer in Maastricht. In 1833 he left Maastricht, then blockaded by the Belgian forces, and made his way to Brussels, where he became a naturalized Belgian, and was attached to the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne. In 1843 he entered the education department, and eventually became a provincial inspector of normal/elementary schools in Antwerp. Two years later he was appointed special inspector to the normal schools and kept this job until he died at Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, a suburb of Brussels, on 1 December 1874. Writings His native language was Dutch, and as a French-writing poet André van Hasselt had to overcome the difficulties of writing in a language foreign to his home land. He had published a Chant héllenique in honour of Canaris in the columns of La Sentinelle des Pays-Bas as early as 1826, and other poems followed. His first volume of verse, Primeveres (1834), shows markedly the influence of Victor Hugo, which had been strengthened by a visit to Paris in 1830. His relations with Hugo became intimate in 1851-1852, when the poet was an exile in Brussels. In 1839 he became editor of the Renaissance, a paper founded to encourage the fine arts. His chief work, the epic of the Quatre Incarnations du Christ, was published in 1867. In the same volume were printed his Études rythmiques, a series of metrical experiments designed to show that the French language could be adapted to every kind of musical rhythm. With the same end in view he executed translations of many German songs, and wrote new French libretti for the best- known operas of Mozart, Weber and others. Legacy A selection from his works (10 vols, Brussels, 1876–1877) was edited by Charles Hen and Louis Alvin. He wrote many books for children, chiefly under the pseudonym of Alfred Avelines; and studies on historical and literary subjects. The books written in collaboration with Charles Hen are signed Charles André. A bibliography of his writings is appended to the notice by Louis Alvin in the Biographie nat. de Belgique, vol. vii. Van Hasselt's fame continued to increase after his death. A series of tributes to his memory was printed in the Poesies choisies (1901), edited by M. Georges Barral for the Collection des poètes français de l'etranger. This book contained a biographical and critical study by Jules Guillaume, and some valuable notes on the poet's theories of rhythm.

Historically, the name refers to a hamlet centred on a mill on the River Cam, a short distance to the southwest of the city centre. The modern council ward of Newnham covers much of the west of the city. Several Cambridge University colleges are situated in this ward, including Newnham, Wolfson, Robinson, Selwyn and Darwin. In modern times Newnham has become one of the most affluent areas of Cambridge and sometimes features in national quality of life surveys.Newnham, Hemingford Abbots and Saffron Walden among best places in UK to live, Sunday Times says; Newnham also has the lowest violent crime rates in the city, see Cambridge Violent Crime Statistics Newnham includes Granchester Meadows and Lammas Land, a recreation ground and playground. History The early hamlet of Newnham was situated on the west bank of the River Flit, on an island of permanently dry land. The surrounding land was liable to flooding, particularly during the winter months. A permanent cut of the river leads to the Newnham watermill, which predated the Norman conquest of 1066, and is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The hamlet was linked to the town of Cambridge by a series of small bridges and fords over the various channels of the River Cam. A road led to the nearby village of Grantchester. In 1256, the Carmelite order of monks established a convent in Newnham, with a church, cloister, dormitory and other buildings. Over the next 50 years, the order gradually moved from a contemplative tradition to more interactive religious practices. This, along with the fact that the convent was frequently cut off from Cambridge by winter flooding, led the order to move to Cambridge in 1292. In the late 19th century, after the enclosure of the Cambridge fields, Newnham Croft was constructed — a middle-class suburb located partly within the Cambridge town boundary, and partly within the parish of Grantchester. In 1870, a church was built to serve the growing community. Initially, St Mark's Church on Barton Road (A603) was a daughter church to the parish of Grantchester. Newnham Croft was incorporated into the borough of Cambridge in 1911; Newnham was created as a separate parish in 1918. It is served by Newnham Croft Primary School. From 1885, Sir George Darwin (son of Charles Darwin) lived in Newnham Grange (built in 1793), where he raised his children (including Sir Charles Darwin and Gwen Raverat). After the death of Sir Charles, son of Sir George, the building was acquired by the newly founded Darwin College.

A combined Swedish fleet, with a large element of hired Dutch ships, defeated a Danish fleet and took 1000 prisoners, including Ulfeldt, Grabov and von Jasmund. The Danish admiral Pros Mund was killed in the battle. The Swedes had 16 ships with 392 guns, and the Dutch element had 21 ships with 483 guns (making a total of 37 ships with 875 guns). The Danes had 17 ships with 448 guns. The Swedes expended two fireships and the Dutch lost one ship. The Danes lost 10 ships captured, including their largest three, and two wrecked.  The battle  On the morning of 13 October the Swedish-Dutch fleet weighed anchor and prepared for battle by dividing into two Swedish and three Dutch squadrons. One of the Swedish squadrons was led by Wrangel on Smålands Lejon and the other under vice admiral Peter Blum on Draken. The Dutch squadrons were commanded by Thijssen onboard Jupiter, vice admiral Henrik Gerretsen on Groote Dolphijn and schout-bij-nacht Pieter Marcussen on Groot Vliessingen. The Danish fleet was divided in two squadrons under admiral Pros Mund on Patentia and Joachim Grabow on Lindormen. Around 10 am the larger ships in both fleets were within firing range of each other and started firing. The smaller Danish ships retreated from the battle, but were pursued by the Dutch ships. Early in the battle the Swedish flagship Smålands Lejon was so damaged in her rigging and hull that she had to pull out. The Swedish ships Regina and Göteborg attacked and boarded the Danish flagship Patentia. The Danish admiral Pros Mund was killed during the fighting. The Swedish fire ship Meerman was sent against the Danish Lindormen, which quickly caught fire and exploded.http://www.ln- online.de/lokales/ostholstein/3484318/1664-gesunkenes-wrack-vor-fehmarn- zeugen-vom-meeresgrund Local news, 26 June 2012(in German) The wreck was discovered in 2012. Wreck of Lindormen found 2 miles north of Island of Fehmarn (in German) Swedish Nya Fortuna captured the Danish man-of-war Oldenborg by boarding. The last man-of-war Tre Løver veered off, but was pursued by Anckarhjelm's Dutch Jupiter, Patentia and Swarte Arent. Tre Løver managed to sink Swarte Arent before the two other Dutch ships boarded her. The smaller Danish vessels Tu Løver, Havhesten, and Fides were captured by Dutch Jupiter and Groote Dolphijn. A cluster of Danish ships were forced against the shore of Lolland, among them Neptunus, Nellebladet, Stormarn, and Kronet Fisk. These were later towed by the Dutch. Danish Delmenhorst went aground and exploded after being set on fire by the Swedish fire ship Delfin. Danish Markatten, Højenhald and a galleot also went aground, but cannon fire from land protected them from the Dutch. Only Pelikanen and Lammet managed to escape and sail to Copenhagen on 17 October.  Consequences  The Danes lost twelve ships, of which ten were captured. A hundred men perished and about 1,000 were captured. The ship Swarte Arent was the only loss on the Swedish side; its crew was rescued. In total, the Swedish side suffered only 59 deaths. The victory was one of the greatest in the history of the Royal Swedish Navy. Even if transshipping Torstensson's soldiers to the Danish islands was no longer a threat, since these were now intent on meeting general Gallas' Imperial troops approaching from the south, the Danes realized that Sweden had total naval dominance after the battle. This paved the way for negotiations and eventually the treaty of Brömsebro on 13 August 1645.

It is one of the largest centers for contemporary visual art and performing arts in the United States. Built by the Arnold Print Works, which operated on the site from 1860 to 1942, the complex was used by the Sprague Electric company before its conversion. MASS MoCA originally opened with 19 galleries and of exhibition space in 1999. It has expanded since, including the 2008 expansion of Building 7 and the May 2017 addition of roughly 130,000 square feet when Building 6 was opened. In addition to housing galleries and performing arts spaces, it also rents space to commercial tenants. It is the home of the Bang on a Can Summer Institute, where composers and performers from around the world come to create new music. The festival, started in 2001, includes concerts in galleries for three weeks during the summer. Starting in 2010, MASS MoCA has become the home for the Solid Sound Music Festival. MASS MoCA, along with the Clark Art Institute and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), forms a trio of significant art museums in the northern Berkshires. Museum location and historyArnold Print Works= The buildings that MASS MoCA now occupies were originally built between 1870 and 1900 by the company Arnold Print Works. These buildings, however, were not the first to occupy this site. Since colonial times small-scale industries had been located on this strategic peninsular location between the north and south branches of the Hoosic River. In 1860 the Arnold brothers arrived at this site and set up their company with the latest equipment for printing cloth. They began operating in 1862 and quickly took off. Aiding their success were large government contracts during the Civil War to supply cloth for the Union Army.Trainer, p. 9 In December 1871, a fire swept through the Arnold Print Works factory and destroyed eight of its buildings. Rebuilding started almost immediately and an expanded complex was finished in 1874. Despite a nationwide depression during the 1870s Arnold Print Works purchased additional land along the Hoosic River and constructed new buildings. By 1900, every building but one in today's Marshall Street complex was constructed. The industrial qualities of the buildings remain, despite the conversion to a fine arts museum At its peak in 1905, Arnold print works employed more than 3,000 workers and was one of the world's leading producers of printed textiles. Arnold produced 580,000 yards or 330 miles of cloth per week. Arnold had offices in New York City and Paris. In addition to printing the textiles, Arnold Print Works expanded and built their own cloth-weaving facilities in order to produce \\"grey cloth\\", which was the crude, unfinished textile from which printed color cloth was made.Trainer, p. 10 In 1942 Arnold Print Works was forced to close its doors and leave North Adams due to the low prices of cloth produced in the South and abroad, as well as the economic effects of the Great Depression. =Sprague Electric Company= Robert C. Sprague's (son of Frank J. Sprague) Sprague Electric Company was a local North Adams company, and it purchased the Marshall Street complex to produce capacitors. During World War II Sprague operated around the clock and employed a large female workforce—not only due to the lack of men, but also because it took small hands and manual dexterity to construct the small, hand-rolled capacitors. In addition to manufacturing electrical components, Sprague had a large research and development department.Trainer, p. 11 This department was responsible for research, design, and manufacturing of the trigger for the atomic bomb and components used in the launch systems for the Gemini moon missions. At its peak during the 1960s Sprague employed 4,137 workers in a community of 18,000. Essentially the factory was a small city within a city with employees working alongside friends, neighbors and relatives. The company was almost completely self-sufficient, holding a radio station, orchestra, vocational school, research library, day-care center, clinic, cooperative grocery store, sports teams, and a gun club with a shooting range on the campus. In the 1980s Sprague began to face difficulties with global changes in the electronics industry. Cheaper electronic components were being produced in Asia combined with changes in high-tech electronics forced Sprague to sell and shutdown its factory in 1985. As a result, North Adams was left \\"deindustrialized\\" and found itself on a steep economic decline.Trainer, p.11 The site was formerly listed as a superfund contaminated site. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The main entrance to the museum, with the campanile tower on the right (2012) =MASS MoCA= The development of MASS MoCA began a year after Sprague vacated the buildings. In 1986 a group of staff from the nearby Williams College Museum of Art were looking for large factory or mill buildings where they could display and exhibit large works of modern and contemporary art that they weren't able to display in their more traditional museum/gallery setting. They were directed to the Marshall Street complex by the mayor of North Adams. When they spent time with the space, they quickly realized the buildings had much more potential than an offshoot gallery. The process for MASS MoCA began. It took a number of years of fund- raising and organization to develop MASS MoCA. During this process the project evolved to create not only new museum/gallery space but also a performing arts venue. The transformation was chronicled by photographer Nicholas Whitman's Mass MoCA: From Mill to Museum. The museum was granted $18.6 million by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after a public/private coalition petitioned the state government to support the project.Trainer, p. 12 In 1999 MASS MoCA opened its doors. Designed by the Cambridge architecture firm of Bruner Cott & Assoc, it was awarded highest honors by the American Institute of Architects and The National Trust for Historic Preservation. In 2015, an Assets for Artists residency program began providing artists and writers business coaching and studio space at the museum and at Maker’s Mill, a collaborative workspace founded that year to bring to downtown North Adams the “artisanal work that once formed the manufacturing economy of the region, fiber arts and printing.” On May 29, 2017, Building 6 was opened as gallery space, adding some 130,000 square feet of exhibition space. Ongoing exhibitionsSol LeWitt Wall Drawing Retrospective Exhibition= On November 16, 2008, the museum opened an exhibition of Sol LeWitt wall drawings in partnership with Yale University Art Gallery and Williams College Museum of Art. The exhibition, Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective occupies a building located at the center of the campus. More than 100 monumental wall drawings and paints conceived by the artist from 1968-2007 will be on view through 2033. Cambridge-based Bruner/Cott & Associates converted the historic mill building and worked with LeWitt to design the gallery space. LeWitt designed the final placement of the drawings before his death in April 2007, and the drawings were installed by a team of draftsmen between April 1 and September 30, 2008. The exhibition was chosen as the \\"top museum exhibition of 2008\\" by Time Magazine. = Anselm Kiefer = A collaboration with the Hall Art Foundation, this presentation of work by German painter and sculptor Anselm Kiefer consists of three monumentally scaled installations, Etroits Sont Les Vaisseaux, Les Femmes De La Revolution, and Velimir Chlebnikov, and occupies a 10,000 square foot building renovated for the exhibition. On view Spring/Summer/Fall through 2028. =Natalie Jeremijenko= Tree Logic. Installed in the museum's front courtyard, this project displays the slow yet dynamic changes of six live trees, inverted and suspended from a truss, over time.  Past exhibitions  Invisible Cities = Titled after an Italo Calvino book, the exhibition featured the work of ten artists who reimagine urban landscapes both familiar and fantastical. Invisible Cities included works by Lee Bul, Carlos Garaicoa, and Sopheap Pich, as well as commissions by Diana Al Hadid, Francesco Simeti, Miha Strukelj, and local artists Kim Faler and Mary Lum. = Oh, Canada = The largest survey of contemporary Canadian art ever produced outside Canada, \\"Oh, Canada\\" features work by more than 60 artists from every Canadian province and nearly every Canadian territory, spanning multiple generations and working in many media. Notable participating artists: *Kim Adams *Shuvinai Ashoona *Dan Barrow *Rebecca Belmore *Shary Boyle *Bill Burns *Eric Cameron *Douglas Coupland *Michel de Broin *Marcel Dzama *Michael Fernandes *Noam Gonick and Luis Jacob *David Hoffos *Sarah Anne Johnson *Garry Neill Kennedy *Wanda Koop *Micah Lexier *Craig Leonard *Kelly Mark *Rita McKeough *Chris Millar *Kent Monkman *Kim Morgan *Annie Pootoogook *Ned Pratt *Michael Snow *Charles Stankievech *Hans Wendt *Janet Werner *John Will =Katharina Grosse= One Floor Up More Highly. Katharina Grosse applied paint to four mounds of soil which seemed to spill from the upper balcony into the enormous space below. Stacks of styrofoam shards rose out of the mountains of color, mirroring the white of the gallery walls. =Petah Coyne= Everything That Rises Must Converge. Baroque style pieces were displayed in four galleries on MASS MoCA's main floor. One piece, \\"Scalapino/Nu Shu\\", came upon the viewer as a former apple-bearing tree. Coyne had it uprooted and brought to the museum after it stopped bearing fruit. Petah's exhibit also includes a selection of her photography. =Sean Foley= Ruse. Sean Foley's commissioned work for MASS MoCA occupied the over-100-foot-long wall outside of the Hunter Center for the Performing Arts. =Jörg Immendorff= Student of Beuys, 6 paintings. Jörg Immendorff was one of several prominent artists of the past four decades who studied under Joseph Beuys at the Düsseldorf Academy of Art. This exhibition was the second in an occasional series of shows focused on Beuys and those influenced by his work and teaching. = Jenny Holzer Projections = On November 18, 2007, Jenny Holzer presented her first indoor projection in the United States. Holzer's projection at Mass MoCA filled a large chamber first with selected poems by Nobel laureate Wisława Szymborska, and later with selections from prose by Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek. = Badlands: New Horizons in Landscape = \\"Badlands\\" (May 24, 2008 - April 12, 2009) was an exhibition of environmental art that explored contemporary artists’ fascination with the Earth and their responses to environmental concerns. Works were commissioned for the exhibit from Vaughn Bell, the Center for Land Use Interpretation, Nina Katchadourian, Joseph Smolinski and Mary Temple. Other artists exhibiting included Robert Adams, the Boyle Family, Melissa Brown, Leila Daw, Gregory Euclide, J. Henry Fair, Mike Glier, Anthony Goicolea, Marine Hugonnier, Paul Jacobsen, Mitchell Joachim, Jane Marsching, Alexis Rockman, Edward Ruscha, Yutaka Sone and Jennifer Steinkamp. = Simon Starling = Simon Starling's The Nanjing Particles opened in December 2008. Based on small stereoscopic photograph depicting a large group of Chinese workers in front of Sampson Shoe Factory. Sampson had brought them east from California to break a strike. As a result, North Adams had the largest population of Chinese workers this side of the Mississippi. He viewed the stereograph image underneath a one-million-volt electron microscope, allowing him to see individual metal particles that comprise the photograph and allowing that to propel him towards the creation of two large- scale sculptures that were manufactured by hand in Nanjing, China. = Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle = Opening in December 2009, Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle's Gravity is a Force to be Reckoned With opened with an upside-down Mies van der Rohe glass house in MASS MoCA's large Building 5 gallery space. The architecture of the house comes from plans made by Mies van der Rohe for his house with four columns or the 50x50 house (1951), that was never realized. Within the house, whose furniture defy gravity sitting firmly on the floor that is the ceiling, there is evidence of an occupant who has been up to something. Accompanying the house is a film, titled Always After (The Glass House) (2006). =The Knitting Machine= On June 30, 2005, MASS MoCA presented an American sculptural installation by Dave Cole, who was in residence at MASS MoCA with his project The Knitting Machine which comprised two excavators specially fitted with massive 20' knitting needles. The knitting project was expected to be completed by July 3. The product, \\"The Knitting Machine\\", is an oversized American flag. When the flag was removed from \\"The Knitting Machine\\" it was folded into the traditional flag triangle and was on display in a presentation case which Cole described as \\"slightly smaller than a Volkswagen Beetle\\", accompanied by the 20' knitting needles and a video of the knitting process. =Material World= Sculpture to Environment. Working in a range of industrially produced materials—from plastic sheeting to fishing line—Michael Beutler, Orly Genger, Tobias Putrih, Alyson Shotz, Dan Steinhilber, and collaborators Wade Kavanaugh and Stephen B. Nguyen engage the former factory spaces of the museum's second and third floors, creating extraordinary environments from ordinary things. =Leonard Nimoy= Secret Selves. Artist/actor Leonard Nimoy exhibited a recent photographic series. Shooting in nearby Northampton, Massachusetts, Nimoy recruited volunteers from the community with an open call for portrait models willing to be photographed posed and dressed as their true or imagined \\"secret selves\\". Accompanying the large, life-size photographs is a video documenting the artist's conversations with his subjects. =Past Building 5 exhibitions= Past exhibitors in Building 5 include Robert Rauschenberg, Tim Hawkinson, Robert Wilson, Ann Hamilton, Cai Guo-Qiang, Carsten Höller, Sanford Biggers, Xu Bing, and Ledelle Moe. = Christoph Büchel's installation = In May 2007, the museum became embroiled in a legal dispute with Swiss installation artist Christoph Büchel. The museum had commissioned Büchel to create a massive installation, \\"Training Ground for Democracy\\", the exhibit was to include a rebuilt movie theater, nine shipping containers, a full-size Cape Cod-style house, a mobile home, a bus, and a truck. On May 21, 2007, MASS MoCA filed a one-count complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking permission from Judge Michael A. Ponsor that the museum was entitled to present to the public Büchel's art installation without the artist's consent. Büchel claimed that allowing the public to view it in an unfinished state and without his permission would misrepresent his work, infringe his copyrights, and infringe his moral rights granted under U.S. law, specifically, the 1990 Visual Artists Rights Act. Contrary to Büchel's allegation, the museum alleged that Büchel did not respond to requests by the museum to come and remove the materials. On September 21, 2007, Judge Michael Ponsor of the Federal District Court for Massachusetts in Springfield ruled that there was no copyright violations and no distortion inherent in showing an unfinished work as long as it was clearly labeled as such. Judge Ponsor noted that his opinion would likely not be viewed as creating a legal precedent. Although the museum was granted permission to exhibit Büchel's art installation without his consent, it chose not to do so. Büchel appealed the district court's ruling, and in January 2010 the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit overruled Judge Ponsor, hiding that the 1990 Visual Artists Rights Act applies to unfinished works of art, and that Büchel asserted a viable claim under the Copyright Act that MASS MoCA violated his exclusive right to display his work publicly.

The theory gained favor among some Soviet linguists for ideological reasons, as it was thought to represent \\"proletarian science\\" as opposed to \\"bourgeois science\\". Term Marr adopted the term \\"Japhetic\\" from Japheth, the name of one of the sons of Noah, in order to characterise his theory that the Kartvelian languages of the Caucasus area were related to the Semitic languages of the Middle East (named after Shem, Japheth's brother). Marr postulated a common origin of Caucasian, Semitic-Hamitic, and Basque languages. This initial theory pre-dated the October Revolution (the reference is made in Pan Tadeusz written by Adam Mickiewicz in the 1830s). In 1917, Marr enthusiastically endorsed the revolution, and offered his services to the new Soviet regime. He was soon accepted as the country's leading linguist. Theory Under the Soviet government, Marr developed his theory to claim that Japhetic languages had existed across Europe before the advent of the Indo-European languages. They could still be recognised as a substratum over which the Indo-European languages had imposed themselves. Using this model, Marr attempted to apply the Marxist theory of class struggle to linguistics, arguing that these different strata of language corresponded to different social classes. He stated that the same social classes in widely different countries spoke versions of their own languages that were linguistically closer to one another than to the speech of other classes who supposedly spoke “the same” language. This aspect of Marr’s thinking was an attempt to extend the Marxist theory of international class consciousness far beyond its original meaning, by trying to apply it to language. Marr also insisted that the notion that a people are united by common language was nothing more than false consciousness created by “bourgeois nationalism”. To draw support for his speculative doctrine, Marr elaborated a Marxist footing for it. He hypothesized that modern languages tend to fuse into a single language of communist society. This theory was the basis for a mass campaign of \\"Latinisation\\" in the 1920s and 1930s to replace the existing Cyrillic alphabets of minority languages with Latin alphabets. Obtaining recognition of his theory from Soviet officials, Marr was permitted to manage the National Library of Russia from 1926 until 1930 and the Japhetic Institute of the Academy of Sciences from 1921 until his death in 1934. He was elected Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1930. In 1950, sixteen years after Marr’s death, an article titled \\"Marxism and Problems of Linguistics\\" was published in major Soviet periodicals under the byline of Joseph Stalin. First published in the June 20, July 4, and August 2, 1950 issues of Pravda; reprinted by Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow. It was at least inspired by the writings of Marr’s most energetic opponent, Arnold Chikobava,Smith, Graham (1998), Nation-building in the Post-Soviet Borderlands: The Politics of National Identities, p. 178. Cambridge University Press, . and some sources suggest that most of the text had actually been ghost-written by Chikobava or pieced together from Chikobava's official report to Stalin. The author writes that \\"N. Ya. Marr introduced into linguistics another and also incorrect and non-Marxist formula, regarding the ‘class character’ of language, and got himself into a muddle and put linguistics into a muddle. Soviet linguistics cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula which is contrary to the whole course of the history of peoples and languages.\\" Since then, the Japhetic theory has been seen as deeply flawed, both inside and outside the former Soviet Union, but some of Marr’s surviving students continued to defend and develop it into the late 1960s.

An example of a monosyllabic language would be Old Chinese. Monosyllabism is the name for the property of single-syllable word form. The natural complement of monosyllabism is polysyllabism. Whether a language is monosyllabic or not sometimes depends on the definition of \\"word\\", which is far from being a settled matter among linguists. For example, Modern Chinese (Mandarin) is largely monosyllabic if each written Chinese character is considered a word; which is justified by observing that most characters have proper meaning(s) (even if very generic and ambiguous). However, most entries in a Chinese dictionary are compounds of two or more characters; if those entries are taken as the \\"words\\", then Mandarin is not monosyllabic..

Wells describes a kind of food that can accelerate and extend the growth process, which when introduced to the world causes great upheavals. In Wells' novel, giants have great powers, and they seek to continue growing and improving; only the small people with their small minds stand in their way. This is a symbol of social groups with great potential suppressed by mainstream society, and an expectation for them to eventually change the world in a radical way. Though one of Wells' lesser-known works, many of the features of the novel have been incorporated into other works. *In the novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Violet Beauregarde grows into a giant blueberry using magical gum and Mike Teevee uses Wonka's shrink ray to miniaturize himself. *In the 1937 children's book The Extraordinary Adventures of Karik and Valya by Latvian write Janis Larri (also Yan Larri) two children drink by mistake a miniaturizing elixir, shrink about two hundred times, and their adventures in the grass \\"jungles\\" begin. *In the children's book series The Magic School Bus, the bus is able to shrink to a very small size in order to allow science field trips to impossible locations such as the human body. *', a gnome-like creature who can do magic, including a magical spell to shrink all the family to four inches in height. Film *In 1940's Dr. Cyclops, the protagonists are reduced to less than a foot in size by the titular mad scientist and are subjected to his whims. 1957's The Incredible Shrinking Man inspired a boom in science fiction films that made use of size- alteration in the late 1950s and the 1960s, and also inspired a comic remake in 1981's The Incredible Shrinking Woman. 1957 also saw the release of The Amazing Colossal Man. *In science fiction/horror B-movies, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, enlargement of people or creatures to monstrous size (often accomplished via radiation) was a common theme. Films featuring enlargement include Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, Village of the Giants, The Food of the Gods, 1954's Them!, and Tarantula. Bert I. Gordon is the filmmaker most closely associated with this genre. *Each of the five monsters in DreamWorks 2009 science fiction film Monsters vs. Aliens can be traced to sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The heroine, Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall, was inspired by Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. *Shrinking is often accomplished with a machine of some kind, as in the films Fantastic Voyage, Innerspace and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. In some works, the machine can enlarge as well; in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, a shrinking machine makes a toddler 100 feet tall. Both types of machine normally have the ability to reverse the shrinking process (though sometimes, as in Fantastic Voyage, the reversal happens automatically after a certain period). *In the 1999 science fiction film My Favorite Martian, Tim shrinks to tiny size. *In the 2010 film Tooth Fairy, the main character is given a shrinking paste which he uses to shrink to a tiny fairy size. *In the Japanese film Big Man Japan, the protagonist is the latest in a dynasty of heroes who can grow to enormous size to fight equally huge monsters. *In the 2001 animated film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, the teacher and Jimmy Neutron shrink to ant-size. *In the musical Babes in Toyland, a shrink gun is used to shrink items and people to the size of toys. *In the 2014 animated film Penguins of Madagascar, a character is shrunk and trapped in a snow globe. *The twist in the BAFTA-winning 2013 short Room 8 concerns a brutal miniaturisation. *The plot of 2017's Downsizing centers on characters voluntarily undergoing miniaturisation to improve their lives and reduce their carbon footprints. Television * In numerous Doctor Who episodes, characters have undergone a reversible shrinking process. These include: in the 1964 three-part serial Planet of Giants, the First Doctor and his companions arrive in contemporary England, but miniaturised due to an accident with their space/time-travel craft, the TARDIS; in the 1973 four-part serial Carnival of Monsters, the TARDIS is caught in the miniaturisation field of a peepshow machine, the Miniscope, reducing the Third Doctor and his companion Jo Grant in size within the confines of its various captured environments; the 1977 four-part serial The Invisible Enemy sees the Fourth Doctor use a component from the TARDIS, called a Relative Dimensional Stabiliser (RDS), to shrink clone copies of himself and his companion Leela for injection into his own brain – later, the RDS is used to increase the size of a micro-dimensional virus so that it can interact with the macrocosm; a not dissimilar trick is pulled by the Doctor and his ally Drax in the 1979 six- part serial The Armageddon Factor, to elude pursuers – and use robotic companion K9 as a 'Trojan Horse'; in the 1984 four-part serial Planet of Fire, the Fifth Doctor finds the murderous habit of his old enemy the Master – of shrinking victims to death with a Tissue Compression Eliminator (TCE) weapon – has backfired, leaving him alive but in \\"reduced circumstances\\". Into the Dalek in 2014 featured the Twelfth Doctor, his companion Clara Oswald and a group of rebel fighters are miniaturised and 'injected' into a battle-scarred, broken Dalek aboard the command ship Aristotle. * Micro Ventures, a short- lived segment on the Banana Splits, about a father and his two kids being shrunk to observe the life of insects. * In 'Dr. Shrinker', a segment of the mid-1970s children's show The Krofft Supershow, the eponymous doctor uses his invention to shrink three young adults to six inches tall. * The Schoolhouse Rock episode \\"Unpack Your Adjectives\\" includes a scene where a girl grows into a giant size and a boy shrinks into a small size, just before the girl steps on the boy. * In the animated series Adventure Time, Jake the Dog is able to magically stretch or shrink himself to various sizes. * In The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog episode \\"Too Tall Tails\\", a machine used by Dr. Robotnik causes Tails to grow to enormous size. * In the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"The Terratin Incident\\", a ray of unknown origin strikes the Enterprise and causes everyone aboard to begin gradually shrinking. Spock explains this as the gaps between molecules reducing, though only in organic material such as flesh and the crews' algae-based xenylon uniforms. When Captain Kirk beams down to the planet from which the ray emanated, the effect of the transporter restores him to normal size. * In the Mega Man cartoon episode \\"Incredible Shrinking Mega Man\\", stolen gems are used in a shrink ray to miniaturize cities and the protagonist. * In The Powerpuff Girls episode \\"What's the Big Idea\\", Mojo Jojo uses his invention to make Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup grow to gigantic sizes. However, he is foiled when Professor Utonium uses his own machine to reverse the effects by making Townsville bigger. * In the television series Ally McBeal, the titular main character is shown shrinking to about six inches in height, most notably in Season 2, Episode 7 ‘Happy Trails’ * In the MGM cartoons Tom and Jerry shorts Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse, Tom shrinks to the size of a fly. In Is There a Doctor in the Mouse?, Jerry grows to a very large size. * In each episode of the animated show Micro Ventures, a machine is used to shrink characters and their dune buggy to miniature size for the purpose of exploration. * In the animated series Wild Kratts, the Kratt Brothers often make use of the Miniaturizer, a machine invented by Aviva, to shrink down to smaller size and back again. Despite its name, the Miniaturizer is also capable of enlarging objects that are in their normal size, resulting in gigantification rather than reverse- miniaturization. * In the Gravity Falls episode \\"Little Dipper\\", magical crystals are used to grow and shrink. * In the 1990 television musical film Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme, Gordon Goose and Bo Beep shrink and grow. * In the Secret World of Santa Claus episode \\"The Tall Little Girl\\", a girl named Kinshey is grown to giant size by a potion made by Santa's elves. * In the Power Rangers, the villains make all the monsters grow, using magical powers, to get ready for the Megazord transformation fight in the final battle. In the Power Rangers Zeo episode \\"Good as Gold\\" Trey of Triforia uses his staff to grow himself and the Rangers to giant size in order to battle. * Each of the three television series in the Lilo & Stitch franchise involved resizing in several episodes, with lead character Stitch growing into a giant via different methods in each of the shows. ** Lilo & Stitch: The Series featured several episodes where a genetic experiment grows larger; \\"Tank\\" features an experiment (Experiment 586/Tank) that grows larger by eating metal, \\"Short Stuff\\" has Stitch, Experiment 625/Reuben, and a crab-like experiment (Experiment 297/Shortstuff) grow into giants thanks to a growth ray made by Jumba; \\"Ploot\\" features an experiment (Experiment 505/Ploot; misnumbered 515 in the episode) that grows larger from ingesting trash, and \\"Phoon\\" has a small wind-blowing experiment (Experiment 540/Phoon) mutated into a giant monster by a different device Jumba makes that was supposed to defeat it. Additionally, the episode \\"Poxy\\" has Lilo, Stitch, and later Gantu shrunk to a microscopic size by the same machine from \\"Short Stuff\\". ** Two episodes of the anime series Stitch! feature Experiment 001/Shrink, an experiment first introduced in the Lilo & Stitch: The Series finale film Leroy & Stitch (as a cameo) who has the ability to either shrink or enlarge objects. In the episode \\"Shrink\\", the experiment shrinks several characters to a smaller size until he returns them to their regular sizes, although at the end of the episode he instead grows the alien BooGoo to become larger than the planet Earth. In \\"Experiment-A-Palooza\\", Shrink grows Stitch into a giant; because Experiment 210/Retro's own powers were also used on Stitch, Stitch essentially becomes a giant version of his former destructive self. ** The Chinese animated series Stitch & Ai reveals that Stitch has an apparent, previously-unrevealed metamorphosis ability that causes him to grow into a giant monster with four laser-firing tentacles sprouting from his back when his destructive programming is fully triggered. This is one of the major overarching plot points of the series, as the main villainous races in the series try to manipulate Stitch into becoming this form in order to use him for their own means. * In the animated series Fish Hooks episode \\"Fish Out of Water\\", Milo, Oscar, and Bea explore the tank as a song plays. They go laughing at a predatory fish, bounce on chew toys, and take pictures in front of a giant chair. As Milo decides to get Bea back to her audition, the ground shakes and stomping noise heard. Oscar asks if they are seeing a shadow around the corner. A giant cat named Wilford is in front of the fish. A fly lands on his left eye. Trying to calm Bea and Oscar down, Milo comments \\"Maybe he's friendly.\\" Video games *In many Nintendo video games created by Shigeru Miyamoto – including Mario, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Donkey Kong 64, Yoshi's Story, Animal Crossing, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, Kid Icarus: Uprising, Fire Emblem, Pokémon, Super Smash Bros. and Yo-kai Watch franchises – characters can grow or shrink by using various power-ups. *In Touhou Project, a Japanese video game series, the character Suika Ibuki has the power to grow to giant size by manipulating her density; Suika can turn into a giantess about 50-feet tall and create smaller versions of herself. *Super Monkey Ball 2, Dr. Bad Boon used the shrinking gun to shrink MeeMee, AiAi, Baby and GonGon, turning them into tiny size. *In the video game Harley's Humongous Adventure, the title character is miniaturized and must find the broken parts of his shrinking machine in order to return to normal size. Other media *Oyayubihime (Thumb Princess) is a Japanese work based on the fairy tale \\"Thumbelina\\". This story centers around the main character Saeko, who splashes a red liquid on individuals to shrink them to about three inches tall. *Minami-kun no Koibito is a Japanese manga which has been adapted into a television drama four times. The story centers around the main character, Chiyomi, who is shrunk by a magical curse when she and her boyfriend briefly went their separate ways. The caring boyfriend must do all he can to keep her condition a secret from inquisitive classmates and a relative who is a teacher at their school. *The protagonist of the magical girl manga and anime series Hime-chan's Ribbon is able to transform and resize herself by using a magic ribbon. *In the music video of Relient K's \\"Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend\\", a giant Marilyn Manson eats a band member's girlfriend and the band has to go into Manson's body to save her. *The music video to the Bis song \\"Sweet Shop Avengerz\\" features Bis, having been miniaturized to only a few inches tall, performing next to a mouse hole. During the video, the band are nearly crushed by a man with a pen, and nearly eaten by a cat. *Similarly, the video to the Kerbdog song \\"Mexican Wave\\" portrays the band members as only one inch tall, performing the song on a woman's necklace. *In the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, miniaturizing cloning technology known as micloning (maikuro-n ka in Japanese) plays a significant role in the coexistence of a giant alien race called Zentradi and humanity. *In Marvel Comics, \\"Pym particles\\" (invented by character Henry Pym, variously known by the superhero identities Ant-Man, Giant-Man, Goliath and Yellowjacket) cause physical matter to shrink or enlarge by shunting mass into, or drawing mass from, another dimension. In addition to Pym, a number of other superheroes have used Pym particles to change their size, including the Wasp (Pym's ex-wife), the second Goliath, Black Goliath, the second Ant-Man, and the second Yellowjacket. Pym also designed a prison for supervillains that was dubbed \\"the Big House\\", in which superhuman criminals who could not be normally incarcerated were shrunk to six inches in height. *In DC Comics, the equivalent characters are the various individuals who go by the name The Atom. In particular of these people, Professor Ray Palmer is the foremost authority in size and molecular-density- changing technology. The DC Comics super-heroine Elasti-Girl also has the power to shrink and grow at will. *Tons of videos on YouTube discuss the improbability of resizing, including Vsauce3's What Would Happen if You Were Shrunk? and PBS's The Small Problem With Shrinking Ourselves.

It is located approximately two miles East of downtown Nashville, and adjacent to the Catholic Calvary Cemetery. It is open to the public during daylight hours. HistoryAntebellum era= The Mount Olivet Cemetery was established by Adrian Van Sinderen Lindsley and John Buddeke in 1856. It was modelled after the Mount Auburn Cemetery. In the 1870s, a chapel designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style by Hugh Cathcart Thompson was built as an office. The Southern aristocracy was buried in a separate section from common folks. These included planters as well as former governors of Tennessee, U.S. Senators, and U.S. Congressional Representatives. In the antebellum era, slaves were often buried near their owners. Sign of Confederate Circle. Visitors to Nashville were buried alongside paupers. =Confederate circle= After the American Civil War, \\"the Ladies Memorial Society of Nashville with surviving Confederate veterans such as William B. Bate, Daniel Carter, General Benjamin Cheatham, and Thomas Harding purchased 26,588 square feet in the center of Mount Olivet and established Confederate Circle\\" for the interment of Confederate dead. It was used for the interment of Confederate soldiers who had died on nearby battlegrounds and as a memorial to their sacrifice. Women organized such memorial associations and raised money for interment of Confederate soldiers in major cities across the South and areas where there were concentrations of bodies.Drew Gilpin Faust, The Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War, New York: Vintage Civil War Library, 2009, pp. 241-244 The memorial association arranged for burials of about 1,500 soldiers at Confederate Circle. They also built an obelisk. =World War I and beyond= A plaque in memory of Nashvillians who died in World War I was dedicated by General Hugh Mott in 1924. The cemetery was purchased by Stewart Enterprises in 1994. In 2015, the chapel, by then listed on the National Register of Historic Places, burned.

Hullabaloo was started in 1997 by DJ Anabolic Frolic as a way to promote Happy Hardcore music and the kind of event that got back to the roots of what a rave was. Hullabaloo held a total of 44 events in eight years, attended by over 100,000 people. Many of the events sold out in advance. The first Hullabaloo party was \\"Something Good\\", held on June 21, 1997. The rave was hosted at The SpacE! (aka \\"The E! Space\\") at 28 Gunns Rd., Toronto. Party headliner, DJ Hixxy from England, was held up by customs at Pearson International Airport and was unable to perform. Hullabaloo reached its peak in popularity in 1999 when crowds of 4,000 were attending their events. The death of Allen Ho at a Hullabaloo event in 1999 resulted in a coroner's inquest and in increased scrutiny from the media and the local authorities. Faced with legal battles and logistical problems with venues and police, Hullabaloo was forced to cancel an event and downsize as a result.

Early career Barkley was born in Hammersmith, London but raised in Wadebridge, Cornwall. He was educated at Wadebridge School, and later at Colston's Collegiate School, Bristol where, under the guidance of Peter Mallorie and Alan Martinovic, he captained the team to a Daily Mail Cup success in 2000. Professional career Barkley was spotted by Andy Robinson and Brian Ashton while playing for Colston's in 1999–2000. He made his Heineken Cup début for Bath on 6 October 2001, coming on as a reserve against Swansea. He scored his first Heineken Cup try in a game against Italian club Gran Rugby, whilst playing at fullback on 11 October 2002 in Parma. He made his début for England during the summer tour to North America in 2001 in a game against the United States on 16 June in San Francisco, coming on in the second half as a replacement in the 48–19 win. He was 19 years old at the time, and had not yet made a senior appearance for his club. He returned to the England side as a reserve in the opening game of the 2004 RBS Six Nations against Italy in Rome. He held his position for the subsequent match against Ireland at Twickenham. He made a breakthrough in 2004 when Sir Clive Woodward handed him England's number 10 jersey for the Six Nations Championship matches against Wales when he replaced an injured Paul Grayson at fly half and France, scoring 27 points over the two games. It is thought that from his promotion in the 2004 Six Nations he became a regular member of the squad. Later on in 2004, during the mid-year tests against the southern hemisphere nations, Barkley was a reserve for the matches against the All Blacks in Auckland and Wallabies in Brisbane. He started off the 2005 Six Nations as a reserve in the opening match against Wales in Cardiff, but started the next match against France at Twickenham, where he scored a try in the 17–18 defeat. He subsequently started the remaining matches against Ireland, Italy and Scotland. He was a reserve in two other matches in 2005, against Australia and Samoa. Barkley dislocated his thumb in a club match against Leinster, the injury ruling him out of the opening game of the 2006 Six Nations Championship against Wales. England coach Andy Robinson named him in his touring party to Australia in June. Barkley was also one of the 18 players of the touring squad who were named in a 24-man England squad to take on the Barbarians at Twickenham on 28 May. Barkley inspired the first English win over the Barbarians since 2002, as he accumulated 21 points in the match, including one try. He was the starting fly-half for the first of two tests against Australia, England losing 34–3, with Barkley scoring England's only points of the match in the form of a penalty goal. Barkley came off the bench in the second test in Melbourne, which was England's last match on the short tour. On 1 August 2006 Barkley was arrested in Newquay by police using CS spray after a fight in which a man suffered a broken jaw, but was later released without charge. He was selected for the England Saxons for the 2007 Churchill Cup. He was a member of England's 2007 World Cup squad. In search of a new challenge, Barkley joined Gloucester Rugby in July 2008 on a two-year contract after 6 years at Bath. In April 2009, it was announced that he would be returning to Bath after just one season at Gloucester because he felt that Bath was where his heart was and that the club could offer him better opportunities. However, Barkley's new stint at Bath did not start well, breaking his leg at a pre-season contact session. He has now recovered from the injury and is back playing. After only four games back for Bath (one as a replacement and three starting at inside centre), Barkley was already receiving praise for his outstanding performances, with coach Steve Meehan claiming that he should be pressing for a place in Martin Johnson's 44 man squad to tour Australia in the summer. He scored his first try back for Bath against Harlequins Barkley was a key player for Bath in the 2010–11 premiership season, playing a part in 14 matches and scoring 142 points including a last-minute penalty against London Irish in a 24–25 away win. His season was cut short during Bath's away fixture against Gloucester in the premiership after a collision with teammate Butch James saw him break his leg in two places. On 20 September 2012 it was announced that Barkley had signed a contract with Racing Metro under the Medical Joker rule. He scored 16 points in his last Bath game, at the Rec against Sale. On 13 May 2013, Barkley would leave Racing Metro to join Grenoble in the French Top 14 on a two-year contract for the 2013/14 season. However, on 29 January 2014, it was announced Barkley would leave Grenoble with immediate effect due to the move to the French club not working out well for himself. On 3 February 2014, Barkley signed for Welsh region Scarlets in the Pro12 on a four-month contract until the end of the season. On 9 June 2014 it was announced that Barkley had signed for London Welsh at the conclusion of his four-month contract at Scarlets. In 2016 after London Welsh were liquidated Barkley coached Kowloon in the Hong Kong Premiership. Journalism Barkley began contributing to online men's lifestyle magazine Blokely in 2011. The National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA) Barkley is a Patron for NACOA - a charity that provides information, advice and support for anyone affected by their parents drinking. Barkley says \\"Nacoa is a worthy cause and I intend to do the best I can to raise awareness of this hidden illness, an illness that’s close to home for me. Alcohol abuse is everywhere and it’s not only the drinkers who bear the brunt. More often than not, it’s the family or close friends that are affected both emotionally and physically. The unconditional support that Nacoa offers is crucial. To know there is somebody on the end of the phone can sometimes be the difference that person needs to help them through the day, month and sometimes a lifetime.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hammersmith Category:People from Wadebridge Category:People educated at Colston's School Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:Rugby union centres Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby union players Category:Cornish rugby union players Category:Bath Rugby players Category:Gloucester Rugby players Category:Racing 92 players Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire ","title":"Olly Barkley"},{"id":"1626852","text":"Overkill may refer to: * Overkill (term), the use of excessive force or action to achieve a goal  Characters  * Overkill (G.I.

The first franchise release, Stargate (1994) spawned four television series successors, four movies (two in production), a plethora of merchandise, and a massive franchise collectively known as the Stargate (owned by Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer and aired by Syfy, which now owns television properties they previously held with Carolco Pictures). Thanks to Stargate fandom, the franchise has spawned other media including books, television series, video games, comic books and audiobooks. These supplements to the film and series trilogies comprise another universe than the series and the film, and have resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe. These media kept the franchise going in the interim between the film and series trilogies. In 2008, Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Continuum was released direct-to-DVD, which in total grossed over 21 million in the United States. In 2002, the franchise's first animated series, Stargate Infinity, was released as an introduction to the Expanded Universe. In 2004, Stargate Atlantis was released as a spin off from Stargate SG-1 and a new Stargate spin-off series entitled Stargate Universe was released in the fall of 2009.  Fandom  While panned by critics, the 1994 film, Stargate drew much attention grossing close to 200 million USD. The film was praised for its special effects and eventually gathered its own cult following over the years.Storm 2005, pp. 6.

Stargate SG-1 has established many of its own conventions, such as Wolfcon in Europe and Gatecon in Canada among others. The franchise contains many unofficial conventions to such as MediaWest Con and Vividcon established and run by fans of the franchise. Since its early years, Stargate has grown in popularity in Great Britain, France and Germany among other European countries.

Gatecon was conceived in 2000 to provide a place for fans of the show Stargate SG-1 to meet members of the cast and crew, and to get to know their fellow fans. The original organizers met due to an interactive Stargate-themed site run by Ryan Peters under Showtime's umbrella. Since its inception, Gatecon has raised money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation through a series of auction evenings. Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer (MGM) and Bridge Studios donated props and costumes. Because of the financial crisis, Gatecon decided to not hold any convention until 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Gatecon's founder Allan Gowen said, \\"With the current world economic status it is making it harder and harder for people to attend conventions,\\" as the reason why there is not going to be any Gatecon in 2009. Until 2005, Gatecon was the main Stargate SG-1 fan convention. It was held in the Vancouver area, with more actor and crew member participation than other conventions. SG-1 conventions by Creation Entertainment were also marketed as \\"The Official Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis Tour\\", which mostly took place in the United States until Creation Entertainment acquired the license for Vancouver conventions in 2005. Wolf Events organized many SG-1 conventions in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany.Storm 2005, pp. 93–95.

Though the site focused on Stargate, other parts of the site were devoted to other sci-fi series in the form of episode guides. It was during this time that Starguide was given the new name GateWorld. The main site was completely redesigned in 2006 to coincide with the broadcast of Stargate SG-1s milestone 200th episode. With the cancellation of Stargate SG-1, Gateworld announced its support for SaveStargateSG1, a fan run campaign to get international networks and executives to show support for Stargate SG-1 and to help get it back on the air. Although the webpage focus lay on news coverage and the episode guides, it also started to include a large encyclopedia, reviews and a store.

The genre is exemplified by singer-songwriters Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp and country music artists, including Steve Earle and Joe Ely. The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s, when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success. Characteristics Bruce Springsteen, the most commercially successful act in the genre of heartland rock, performing in East Berlin in 1988 The term heartland rock was not coined to describe a clear genre until the 1980s. In terms of style it often uses straightforward rock and roll, sometimes with elements of Americana with a basic rhythm and blues line-up of drums, keyboards and occasional horn section instruments like a saxophone. However, this common definition may represent an oversimplification given that Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, most often thought of as the archetypal heartland rock record, made heavy use of synthesizers, most notably on the hit singles \\"Dancing in the Dark\\", \\"Glory Days\\" and the title track. Lyrics are often presented in a style that is raspy and unpolished, adding a sense of authenticity. The genre was most strongly influenced by American country, folk, 1960s garage rock, the Rolling Stones, and folk rock acts such as Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie,T. Weschler and G. Graff, Travelin' Man: On the Road and Behind the Scenes with Bob Seger (Wayne State University Press, 2009), , p. xvi. CCR, Bob Dylan, and The Byrds. Verses in heartland rock songs often tell stories. In some songs, those stories are about people undergoing hard times; choruses are often anthemic in tone. The genre is associated with working-class regions of the Midwest and the Rust Belt.G. Thompson, American Culture in the 1980s (Edinburgh:Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 138. It has been characterized as a predominantly romantic genre, celebrating \\"urban backstreets and rooftops\\",K. Keightley, \\"Reconsidering rock\\" in S. Frith, W. Straw and J. Street, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), , p. 138. and its major themes include alienation, despair, \\"unemployment, small-town decline, disillusionment, limited opportunity and bitter nostalgia\\".C. Detweiler and B. Taylor, A Matrix of Meanings: Finding God in Pop Culture (Baker Academic, 2003), , p. 145, HistoryOrigins= Many major heartland rock artists began their careers in the 1960s, as with Bob Seger, or the 1970s, as with Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Springsteen would be the first artist to bring heartland rock to US and international attention, and its most commercially successful exponent. After a series of critically highly regarded, but modestly selling albums with the E Street Band, he achieved his breakthrough in 1975 with Born to Run, which presented stories of loss, betrayal, defeat and escape in the context of his native New Jersey shoreline, with songs influenced by 50s rock and roll, Bob Dylan and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. While Springsteen struggled for three years with legal disputes, other artists in a similar vein came to the fore. These artists included Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. In 1978, Springsteen returned with Darkness on the Edge of Town, which reached the top ten in the US and then the number one album The River (1980), which continued the themes of economic and personal dissolution, produced a series of hit singles, and has been seen as \\"getting the heartland rock bandwagon rolling\\", together with the stripped-down sound and darker themes of his next album Nebraska (1982). =Peak= John Mellencamp, shown in 2007, among the most successful of the \\"second generation\\" of acts in the genre The genre reached its commercial peak with Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. in 1984. The 1980s saw the continued success of artists such as John Fogerty and the Steve Miller Band, as well as the arrival of new artists like John Mellencamp, Michael Stanley, George Thorogood, John Cafferty, Drive-By Truckers, Kentucky Headhunters, Bruce Hornsby & the Range, Iron City Houserockers, Leon Russell, John Hiatt, Lucinda Williams, and BoDeans. A number of roots music and country music artists like Steve EarleS. T. Erlewine, \\"Steve Earle: Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved December 16, 2010., The Tractors, Hot Club of Cow Town, and Joe Ely also became associated with the genre.W. Ruhlmann, \\"Joe Ely: Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved December 16, 2010. The first significant female artist in the genre was Melissa Etheridge(Kansas), whose self-titled debut album issued in 1988 drew critical comparisons with Springsteen and Mellencamp.J. A. Peraino, Listening to the Sirens: Musical Technologies of Queer Identity from Homer to Hedwig (University of California Press, 2005), , p. 137.G. Prato, \\"Melissa Etheridge: Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved December 16, 2010. =Decline= In the 1990s, many artists that would have been heartland rockers in the 1980s chose to pursue the recently emerged genre of Americana, https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/inside-the-americana-genres- identity-crisis-202818/, and heartland rock dwindled to a few stalwart artists. Influence Melissa Etheridge, the first significant female figure in the genre, performing live in 2010 Heartland rock can be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel and Kid Rock. Kid Rock has performed in concert with John Mellencamp and recorded a duet with Bob Seger for the latter's Face the Promise album.A.

Biography Valentina was born in Milan as the second of the four children of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the first Duke of Milan,Monica Azzolini, The Duke and the Stars: Astrology and Politics in Renaissance Milan, (Harvard University Press, 2013), 120. and his first wife Isabelle, a daughter of King John II the Good of France. She was probably named after her paternal great- grandmother Valentina Doria, wife of Stefano Visconti. After her mother's death in childbirth in 1373, Valentina and her siblings were raised by their paternal grandmother Bianca of Savoy and aunt Violante Visconti. The deaths of her brothers Carlo (1374), Gian Galeazzo (1376) and Azzone (1381) left Valentina as the only surviving child of her parents' marriage and the Countess of Vertus, a title she shared with her spouse. In 1380, a marriage was negotiated with her cousin Carlo Visconti, Lord of Parma (fourth son of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan) and a papal dispensation was even granted; however, Bernabò later annulled the betrothal and, in 1382, married his son to a French noblewoman, Beatrice of Armagnac. The death of Bernabò in 1385 left Gian Galeazzo as the sole ruler over the Visconti inheritance, and with this Valentina's status changed considerably. At this point, the new Lord of Milan opened negotiations with King Wenceslaus of Germany and Bohemia for a marriage between Valentina and his half-brother John of Görlitz; at the same time, he also negotiated a union with Louis II of Anjou, titular King of Naples (who was at that time was betrothed to Lucia Visconti, one of Bernabò's daughters). However, Marie of Blois, Dowager Duchess of Anjou finally cancelled the negotiations, and then Gian Galeazzo turned his attention to his nephew-by- marriage Louis, Duke of Touraine, second son of King Charles V of France and brother of the reigning Charles VI. King Wenceslaus became aware of the double game of Gian Galeazzo, and broke off the negotiations with a letter full of insults, leaving Louis the only suitor of Valentina, his first cousin. Because of the close relationship between bride and groom, a papal dispensation was granted on 25 November 1386, and the marriage contract was signed on 27 January 1387 in Paris. Valentina received as a dowry the County of Vertus (which was the dowry of her own mother at the time of her marriage in 1348) and the city of Asti, with the sums of 450,000 florins in cash and 75,000 florins in jewelry. In the contract was also stipulated that in absence of male heirs, Valentina would inherit the Visconti dominions. It was because of this, that her grandson Louis XII of France claimed the Duchy of Milan and embarked on the Italian Wars. The marriage by proxy was celebrated three months later, on 8 April, in both the Milanese and French courts. Valentina was only able to leave Milan for France on 23 June 1389, because of \\"reasons of security\\" given to her father: in fact, Gian Galeazzo wanted to amend the marriage contract after the pregnancy of his second wife Caterina Visconti (another Bernabò's daughters) ended. Only after the birth of his son Gian Maria on 7 September 1388 did he feel secure enough to send his daughter to France. Escorted by her paternal cousin Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy and a retinue of 300 knights, Valentina was finally handed to Louis's envoys. The formal marriage took place in the city of Melun, on 17 August 1389. The union produced eight children: *A son (born and died in Paris, 25 March 1390), buried in Paris église Saint-Paul. *Louis (Paris, Hôtel de Saint-Pol, 26 May 1391 - September 1395), buried in Paris église des Célestins. *John (September 1393 - Château de Vincennes, bef. 31 October 1393), buried in Paris église des Célestins. *Charles, Duke of Orléans (Hôtel royal de Saint-Pol, Paris, 24 November 1394 - Château d'Amboise, Indre-et-Loire, 4 January 1465), father of King Louis XII of France. *Philip, Count of Vertus (Asnières-sur-Oise, Val d'Oise, 21/24 July 1396 - Beaugency, Loiret, 1 September 1420). *John, Count of Angoulême (24 June 1399 – Château de Cognac, Charente, 30 April 1467), grandfather of King Francis I of France. *Marie (Château de Coucy, Aisne, April 1401 - died shortly after birth). *Margaret (4 December 1406 - Abbaye de Laguiche, near Blois, 24 April 1466), married Richard of Brittany, Count of Étampes. She received the County of Vertus as a dowry. In 1392 her husband exchanged the Duchy of Touraine for the Duchy of Orléans; since then, Valentina was styled Duchess of Orléans. Because of intrigues at the court of Charles VI of France and the enmity of the queen, Isabeau of Bavaria- Ingolstadt, Valentina was exiled from the court and had to leave Paris. There were rumours that Isabeau was having an affair with Louis and that Valentina was very close to the King, who was in poor mental health. A patroness of Eustache Deschamps, who wrote poetry in her honour, she was also the mother of one of France's most famous poets, Charles of Orléans.

Life Payne first came to national attention in 1978 when police raided her home while a sex party was in progress. Men paid with luncheon vouchers to dress up in lingerie and be spanked by young women.Hugh Davies \\"Payne's sex party souvenirs for sale\\", Daily Telegraph, 14 December 2004 Police found 53 men at her residence, in varying levels of undress, which included \\"a peer of the realm, an MP, a number of solicitors and company directors and several vicars\\". A cartoon in the press at the time, according to Sarah Baxter in The Sunday Times, \\"showed a vicar in bed with a prostitute, confronted by a policeman. 'I demand to see my solicitor,' said the vicar, 'who is in the next bedroom.'\\" When the case came to trial in 1980, Payne was sentenced to 18 months in prison, reduced to a fine and six months on appeal.\\"1987: Mrs Payne is no brothel Madam\\", BBC On This Day, 11 February She served four months in Holloway prison. In 1986 the police raided Payne's home again, this time during a \\"special party\\" she was hosting after shooting of the film of her life had been completed. Although she was acquitted on this occasion, the resulting court case in 1987 made headlines for several weeks with lurid tales, some details of which she aired on The Dame Edna Experience in 1987, with co-guests Sir John Mills and Rudolf Nureyev, on which she also launched her book, Entertaining at Home. The court case ended Payne's career as a party giver. On the programme, Payne expressed an interest in becoming a Member of Parliament in order to change Britain's sex laws, which she followed through by standing for Parliament as a candidate for the Payne and Pleasure Party in the Kensington by-election in July 1988, followed by her standing in her own area of Streatham for the Rainbow Dream Ticket in the 1992 UK General Election. She did not gain a parliamentary seat. There are two comedy films that are loosely based on her life, both released in 1987: Wish You Were Here, about her adolescence, with Emily Lloyd in the lead role, and Personal Services, about her adult life, starring Julie Walters as Cynthia. Both were written by David Leland, who directed Wish You Were Here. Payne made appearances as an after-dinner speaker and launched a range of \\"adult\\" services and products in 2006. Payne died on 15 November 2015, aged 82. Her family celebrated her life a month later with a colourful humanist funeral, in accordance with her wishes.

The benefit is that if anyone compromises the address or utilizes it in connection with email abuse, the address owner can easily cancel (or \\"dispose\\" of) it without affecting any of their other contacts.  Uses  Disposable email addressing sets up a different, unique email address for every sender/recipient combination. It operates most usefully in scenarios where someone may sell or release an email address to spam lists or to other unscrupulous entities. The most common situations of this type involve online registration for sites offering discussion groups, bulletin boards, chat rooms, online shopping, and file hosting services. At a time when email spam has become an everyday nuisance, and when identity theft threatens, DEAs can serve as a convenient tool for protecting Internet users. Disposable email addresses can be cancelled if someone starts to use the address in a manner that was not intended by the creator. Examples are the accidental release of an email to a spam list, or if the address was procured by spammers. Alternatively, the user may simply decide not to receive further correspondence from the sender. Whatever the cause, DEA allows the address owner to take unilateral action by simply cancelling the address in question. Later, the owner can determine whether to update the recipient or not. Disposable email addresses typically forward to one or more real email mailboxes in which the owner receives and reads messages. The contact with whom a DEA is shared never learns the real email address of the user. If a database manages the DEA, it can also quickly identify the expected sender of each message by retrieving the associated contact name of each unique DEA. Used properly, DEA can also help identify which recipients handle email addresses in a careless or illegitimate manner. Moreover, it can serve as a tool for spotting fake messages or phishers.  Advantages over traditional email  Ideally, owners share a DEA once with each contact/entity. Thus, if the DEA should ever change, only one entity needs to be updated. By comparison, the traditional practice of giving the same email address to multiple recipients means that if that address subsequently changes, many legitimate recipients will need to receive notification of the change and to update their records — a potentially tedious process. Additionally, because access has been narrowed down to one contact, that entity then becomes the most likely point of compromise for any spam that account receives (see \\"filtering\\" below for exceptions). This allows users to determine firsthand the trustworthiness of the people with whom they share their DEAs. \\"Safe\\" DEAs that have not been abused can be forwarded to a real email account, while messages sent to \\"compromised\\" DEAs can be routed to a special folder, sent to the trash, held for spam filtering, or returned as undeliverable if the DEA is deleted outright. Further, because DEAs serve as a layer of indirection between the sender and recipient, if the DEA user's actual email address changes, for instance because of moving from a university address to a local ISP, then the user need only update the DEA service provider about the change, and all outstanding DEAs will continue to function without updating.  Using \\"sub-addressing\\"  A number of email systems support \\"sub-addressing\\" (also known as \\"plus\\" or \\"tagged\\" addressing) where a tag can be appended to the \\"local part\\" of an email address — the part to the left of the \\"@\\" — but with the modified address being an alias to the unmodified address. For example, the address joeuser+tag@example.com denotes the same delivery address as joeuser@example.com. The text of the tag may be used to apply filtering, or to create single-use addresses. If available, this feature can allow users to create their own disposable addresses.  Multiple email aliases  Another approach is to register one main email address and many auxiliary email addresses, which will forward all mail to the main address, i.e., the auxiliaries are used as aliases of the main address. The advantage of this approach is that the user can easily detect which auxiliary email is 'leaking' with spam and block or dispose it. Some services require additional time to set up forwarding, but others allow to create new addresses \\"on the fly\\" without registering them with the service in advance. However, this method allows storage and access of all emails from a single main account, although to manage forwarding for some services the user has to remember the password for each alias. A variation is to use a catch-all address, then forward to the real mailbox using wildcards. Many mail servers allow the use of an asterisk (*), meaning \\"any number of characters\\". This makes the whitelist automatic and only requires the administrator to update the blacklist occasionally. In effect, the user has one address, but it contains wild cards, e.g., \\"me.*@my.domain'\\", which will match any incoming address that starts with \\"me.\\" and ends with \\"@my.domain\\". This is very similar to the \\"+\\" notation, but it may be even less obvious, since the address appears to be completely normal.  Concerns  Restrictions by site administrators = Some forum and wiki administrators dislike DEAs because they obfuscate the identity of the members and make maintaining member control difficult. As an example, Internet trolls, vandals and other users that may have been banned may use throwaway email addresses to get around the ban. Using a DEA provider only makes this easier; the same convenience with which a person may create a DEA to filter spam also applies to trolls. Website operators expecting to generate revenue by selling the user email addresses they gather may choose to ban DEAs as well, due to the low market value of such addresses. There are several free lists available to help detect DEA domains, as well as managed services. Banning DEAs might not be as effective at deterring undesirable users. More effective techniques for controlling undesirables without inconveniences to legitimate DEA users might include: recognizing legitimate DEAs for what they are (they usually have a proper domain and a fixed prefix or suffix), distinguishing them from short-lived, random throwaway address patterns or domains used by undesirables, wildcard banning. As with any kind of threat and defense measures, no attempts to use or thwart DEAs are foolproof — any filtering method is bound to result in some false positives (legitimate users getting banned), and some false negatives (undesirables getting through, and legitimate users managing to come up with a DEA pattern getting around limitations imposed by site administrators). This is because the email address may be partly or fully defined by the user, made to appear as \\"permanent\\"-looking as needed, or made to avoid a particular pattern, defeating any filtering because for all intents and purposes it is not different from a permanent one, despite being limited to one purpose. Caught in the crossfire between Internet undesirables and administrative and user attempts to deal with them, DEA providers have trouble presenting a total solution. A user may find it necessary to come up with a conventional-looking email address (or create a separate mailbox in the worst case) to a public/commercial entity if required. There is always uncertainty about the trustworthiness and reputation of the site administrators, the availability of options to hide email addresses, the existence/enforcement of an acceptable privacy policy and the chance that the site may one day be compromised or transferred to new owners. Even the largest and otherwise reputable companies have been compromised or resorted to sending spam or giving away emails to third parties. A human correspondent's computer or mailbox may be compromised by malware and his address book can be stolen and sold to spammers.

It increased the scalability and available bandwidth. Prior to the name's announcement, Intel referred to it as Common System Interface (CSI). Earlier incarnations were known as Yet Another Protocol (YAP) and YAP+. QPI 1.1 is a significantly revamped version introduced with Sandy Bridge-EP (Romley platform). QPI was replaced by Intel Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI) in Skylake-SP Xeon processors based on LGA 3647 socket.SoftPedia: Intel Plans to Replace Xeon with Its New Skylake-Based “Purley” Super Platform Background Although sometimes called a \\"bus\\", QPI is a point-to-point interconnect. It was designed to compete with HyperTransport that had been used by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) since around 2003. Intel developed QPI at its Massachusetts Microprocessor Design Center (MMDC) by members of what had been the Alpha Development Group, which Intel had acquired from Compaq and HP and in turn originally came from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Its development had been reported as early as 2004. Intel first delivered it for desktop processors in November 2008 on the Intel Core i7-9xx and X58 chipset. It was released in Xeon processors code- named Nehalem in March 2009 and Itanium processors in February 2010 (code named Tukwila). Implementation QPI is an uncore component in Intel's Nehalem microarchitecture The QPI is an element of a system architecture that Intel calls the QuickPath architecture that implements what Intel calls QuickPath technology. In its simplest form on a single-processor motherboard, a single QPI is used to connect the processor to the IO Hub (e.g., to connect an Intel Core i7 to an X58). In more complex instances of the architecture, separate QPI link pairs connect one or more processors and one or more IO hubs or routing hubs in a network on the motherboard, allowing all of the components to access other components via the network. As with HyperTransport, the QuickPath Architecture assumes that the processors will have integrated memory controllers, and enables a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Each QPI comprises two 20-lane point-to-point data links, one in each direction (full duplex), with a separate clock pair in each direction, for a total of 42 signals. Each signal is a differential pair, so the total number of pins is 84. The 20 data lanes are divided onto four \\"quadrants\\" of 5 lanes each. The basic unit of transfer is the 80-bit flit, which is transferred in two clock cycles (four 20 bit transfers, two per clock.) The 80-bit flit has 8 bits for error detection, 8 bits for \\"link-layer header\\", and 64 bits for data. QPI bandwidths are advertised by computing the transfer of 64 bits (8 bytes) of data every two clock cycles in each direction. Although the initial implementations use single four-quadrant links, the QPI specification permits other implementations. Each quadrant can be used independently. On high-reliability servers, a QPI link can operate in a degraded mode. If one or more of the 20+1 signals fails, the interface will operate using 10+1 or even 5+1 remaining signals, even reassigning the clock to a data signal if the clock fails. The initial Nehalem implementation used a full four-quadrant interface to achieve 25.6 GB/s, which provides exactly double the theoretical bandwidth of Intel's 1600 MHz FSB used in the X48 chipset. Although some high-end Core i7 processors expose QPI, other \\"mainstream\\" Nehalem desktop and mobile processors intended for single-socket boards (e.g. LGA 1156 Core i3, Core i5, and other Core i7 processors from the Lynnfield/Clarksfield and successor families) do not expose QPI externally, because these processors are not intended to participate in multi-socket systems. However, QPI is used internally on these chips to communicate with the \\"uncore\\", which is part of the chip containing memory controllers, CPU- side PCI Express and GPU, if present; the uncore may or may not be on the same die as the CPU core, for instance it is on a separate die in the Westmere- based Clarkdale/Arrandale. These post-2009 single-socket chips communicate externally via the slower DMI and PCI Express interfaces, because the functions of the traditional northbridge are actually integrated into these processors, starting with Lynnfield, Clarksfield, Clarkdale and Arrandale; thus, there is no need to incur the expense of exposing the (former) front- side bus interface via the processor socket.Lily Looi, Stephan Jourdan, Transitioning the Intel® Next Generation Microarchitectures (Nehalem and Westmere) into the Mainstream, Hot Chips 21, August 24, 2009 Although the core–uncore QPI link is not present in desktop and mobile Sandy Bridge processors (as it was on Clarkdale, for example), the internal ring interconnect between on-die cores is also based on the principles behind QPI, at least as far as cache coherency is concerned.  Frequency specifications QPI operates at a clock rate of 2.4 GHz, 2.93 GHz, 3.2 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.0 GHz or 4.8 GHz (3.6 GHZ and 4.0 GHz frequencies were introduced with the Sandy Bridge-E/EP platform and 4.8 GHz with the Haswell-E/EP platform). The clock rate for a particular link depends on the capabilities of the components at each end of the link and the signal characteristics of the signal path on the printed circuit board. The non-extreme Core i7 9xx processors are restricted to a 2.4 GHz frequency at stock reference clocks. Bit transfers occur on both the rising and the falling edges of the clock, so the transfer rate is double the clock rate. Intel describes the data throughput (in GB/s) by counting only the 64-bit data payload in each 80-bit flit. However, Intel then doubles the result because the unidirectional send and receive link pair can be simultaneously active. Thus, Intel describes a 20-lane QPI link pair (send and receive) with a 3.2 GHz clock as having a data rate of 25.6 GB/s. A clock rate of 2.4 GHz yields a data rate of 19.2 GB/s. More generally, by this definition a two-link 20-lane QPI transfers eight bytes per clock cycle, four in each direction. The rate is computed as follows: :3.2 GHz :× 2 bits/Hz (double data rate) :× 16(20) (data bits/QPI link width) :× 2 (unidirectional send and receive operating simultaneously) :÷ 8 (bits/byte) := 25.6 GB/s  Protocol layers  QPI is specified as a five-layer architecture, with separate physical, link, routing, transport, and protocol layers. In devices intended only for point-to-point QPI use with no forwarding, such as the Core i7-9xx and Xeon DP processors, the transport layer is not present and the routing layer is minimal. ; Physical layer : The physical layer comprises the actual wiring and the differential transmitters and receivers, plus the lowest-level logic that transmits and receives the physical-layer unit. The physical-layer unit is the 20-bit \\"phit.\\" The physical layer transmits a 20-bit \\"phit\\" using a single clock edge on 20 lanes when all 20 lanes are available, or on 10 or 5 lanes when the QPI is reconfigured due to a failure. Note that in addition to the data signals, a clock signal is forwarded from the transmitter to receiver (which simplifies clock recovery at the expense of additional pins). ; Link layer : The link layer is responsible for sending and receiving 80-bit flits. Each flit is sent to the physical layer as four 20-bit phits. Each flit contains an 8-bit CRC generated by the link layer transmitter and a 72-bit payload. If the link layer receiver detects a CRC error, the receiver notifies the transmitter via a flit on the return link of the pair and the transmitter resends the flit. The link layer implements flow control using a credit/debit scheme to prevent the receiver's buffer from overflowing. The link layer supports six different classes of message to permit the higher layers to distinguish data flits from non-data messages primarily for maintenance of cache coherence. In complex implementations of the QuickPath architecture, the link layer can be configured to maintain separate flows and flow control for the different classes. It is not clear if this is needed or implemented for single-processor and dual-processor implementations. ; Routing layer : The routing layer sends a 72-bit unit consisting of an 8-bit header and a 64-bit payload. The header contains the destination and the message type. When the routing layer receives a unit, it examines its routing tables to determine if the unit has reached its destination. If so it is delivered to the next-higher layer. If not, it is sent on the correct outbound QPI. On a device with only one QPI, the routing layer is minimal. For more complex implementations, the routing layer's routing tables are more complex, and are modified dynamically to avoid failed QPI links. ; Transport layer : The transport layer is not needed and is not present in devices that are intended for only point-to-point connections. This includes the Core i7. The transport layer sends and receives data across the QPI network from its peers on other devices that may not be directly connected (i.e., the data may have been routed through an intervening device.) the transport layer verifies that the data is complete, and if not, it requests retransmission from its peer. ; Protocol layer : The protocol layer sends and receives packets on behalf of the device. A typical packet is a memory cache row. The protocol layer also participates in cache coherency maintenance by sending and receiving cache coherency messages.

Background Following the secession of most of Ireland from the United Kingdom in 1922, the then created Irish Free State remained (for the purposes of British law) a dominion of the British Empire and thus its people remained British subjects with the right to live and work in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the Empire.The Irish authorities disputed categorisation of \\"Irish Free State\\" and subsequently \\"Irish\\" citizens as British subjects, see British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland The British monarch continued to be head of state. However, by 1936, systematic attempts to remove references to the monarch from Irish constitutional law meant that the only functions remaining to the Crown were: * signing Letters of Credence accrediting Irish ambassadors to other states; and * signing international treaties on Ireland's behalf. This status quo remained, with Ireland participating little in the British Commonwealth and Éamon de Valera remarking in 1945 that \\"we are a republic\\" in reply to the question if he planned to declare Ireland as a republic.Dáil Éireann debate, Tuesday, 17 Jul 1945 Then somewhat unexpectedly in 1948, during a visit to Canada, Taoiseach John A. Costello announced that Ireland was to be declared a republic. The subsequent Irish legislation, the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, provided for the abolition of the last remaining functions of the King in relation to Ireland and provided that the President of Ireland would exercise these functions in the King's place. When the Act came into force on 18 April 1949, it effectively ended Ireland's status as a British dominion. As a consequence of this, it also had the effect of ending Ireland's membership in the British Commonwealth of Nations and the existing basis upon which Ireland and its citizens were treated in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries as \\"British subjects\\", not foreigners. Summary of provisions The Act's long title summarises the Act's several purposes: The effects of the Acts various subsections are as follows: *s. 1(1) – Declared that the country known in British law as \\"Eire\\" ceased to be \\"part of His Majesty's dominions\\" (i.e. a member of the Commonwealth) on 18 April 1949 (the date that the Irish \\"Republic of Ireland Act 1948\\" came into force). The reasons for including this declaration were described in a Working Party Report to the British Cabinet.Secret Cabinet Paper (49) 4; 7 January 1949 - \\"Ireland: Report of Working Party\\" - Memorandum by the Prime Minister The Report stated such a declaration was desirable firstly because \\"as a matter of law, it [was] arguable, on the terms of the [Statute of Westminster], that some provision by the Parliament at Westminster is required in order to complete the process by which a country ceases to be a member of the Commonwealth.\\" The Report added that inclusion of the declaration would \\"forestall any such legal argument\\". In addition, the Report said the declaration would have the \\"additional advantage of excluding, for all purposes of United Kingdom law, any future argument that Eire ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth, not merely from the date of commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act, but from the entry into force of the new Eire Constitution of 1937.\\" *s. 1(2) – Declared that all of Northern Ireland would continue as part of the United Kingdom, and would remain within the Commonwealth, unless the Parliament of Northern Ireland consented otherwise. The Working Party Report noted around this that \\"it [had] become a matter of first-class strategic importance...that the North should continue to form part of His Majesty's dominions\\". The Report continued that it indeed seemed \\"unlikely that Great Britain would ever be able to agree to [Northern Ireland secession] even if the people of Northern Ireland desired it.\\" *s. 1(3) – Established that the country up to then known in British law as \\"Eire\\" will in future be referred to by subsequent British legislation by the name \\"Republic of Ireland\\". *s. 2(1) – Declared that, even though the Republic of Ireland was no longer a British dominion, it would not be treated as a foreign country for the purposes of British law. *s. 2(2) – Established that the Irish ambassador to the United Kingdom would enjoy the same legal privileges with regard to taxation as the High Commissioners representing Commonwealth countries. *s. 3(1) – Continued in force certain existing British laws in relation to the Republic of Ireland that had previously related to the Irish state. *s. 3(2) – Made blanket provision for how certain wording in existing British legislation should be construed; for example, references to \\"His Majesty's dominions\\" were to be construed as including a reference to the Republic of Ireland despite its actual change of status. *s. 3(3) – Excluded from the generality of the preceding subsection any requirement for the Oireachtas to assent to any change in the law relating to the succession to the throne or the royal style and titles; and also ended the requirement for the Irish government to receive notifications under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937. *ss. 4 and 5 – Made certain technical provisions in relation to both transitional matters and to the citizenship of certain individuals born before the Irish Free State ceased to form part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; fixing a mistake in the British Nationality Act 1948 (see below). *s. 6 – Made a number of technical changes to the electoral law relating to the election of MPs to sit at Westminster for Northern Ireland. The principal change meant required a voter to have lived in Northern Ireland for at least three months prior to the registration date; this change was introduced because the Government of Northern Ireland did not want people from the Republic coming to Northern Ireland to vote in elections there. Repairing mistake in British nationality law The Ireland Act was also used by the United Kingdom to \\"repair an omission in the British Nationality Act, 1948\\". The British Nationality Act included provisions dealing specifically with the position of \\"a person who was a British subject and a citizen of Eire on 31st December, 1948\\". Because of this, how the British law would apply was dependent on a question of Irish law, namely, who was a \\"citizen of Eire\\"? The UK Government seriously misunderstood the position under Irish law. The UK Secretary of State for Home Affairs explained that:HC Deb 01 June 1949 vol 465 cc2235-51 (Secretary of State for Home Affairs) The impact of this was that many people in Northern Ireland were in theory deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. This was an unintended consequence of the British Nationality Act. The Secretary of State also explained the background to the mistake. He reported that under Irish law the question of who was a \\"citizen of Eire\\" was in part, dependent on whether a person was \\"domiciled in the Irish Free State on 6th December, 1922\\". In this regard he noted: The amendment made to the British Nationality Act under the Ireland Act was intended to make it clear, in summary, that regardless of the position under Irish law, the affected persons domiciled in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1922 would not be deprived of a British citizenship status they would otherwise have enjoyed but for Irish law. In view of the above, the amendment made to the British Nationality Act under section 5 of the 1949 Act conferred Citizenship of the UK and Colonies (CUKC) on any Irish-born person meeting all the following criteria: # was born before 6 December 1922 in what became the Republic of Ireland; # was domiciled outside the Republic of Ireland on 6 December 1922; # was ordinarily resident outside the Republic of Ireland from 1935 to 1948; and # was not registered as an Irish citizen under Irish legislation. =Practical effect for descendants= Under section 5 of the act, a person who was born in the territory of the future Republic of Ireland as a British subject, but who did not receive Irish citizenship under the act's interpretation of either the 1922 Irish constitution or the 1935 Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act (because he or she was no longer domiciled in the Republic on the day the constitution came into force and was not permanently resident there on the day of the 1935 law's enactment and was not otherwise registered as an Irish citizen) was deemed to be a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. As such, many of those individuals and some of the descendants in the Irish diaspora of an Irish person who left Ireland before 1922 (and who was also not resident in 1935) may both be registrable for Irish citizenship and be a British citizen, through either: * birth to the first generation emigrant, * registration of later generation births by the married citizen father at the local British consulate within one year of birth, prior to the British Nationality Act (BNA) 1981 taking effect, * by registration, at any time in life, with Form UKF, of birth to an unwed citizen father, or * by registration, at any time in life, with Form UKM, of birth to a citizen mother between the BNA 1948 and the BNA 1981 effective dates, under the UK Supreme Court's 2018 Romein principle. In some cases, British citizenship may be available to these descendants in the Irish diaspora when Irish citizenship registration is not, as in instances of failure of past generations to timely register in a local Irish consulate's Foreign Births Register before the 1986 changes to Irish nationality law and before births of later generations. Northern Ireland's name The Act made no change to Northern Ireland's name. However, earlier drafts of the Bill had included a provision changing Northern Ireland's name to \\"Ulster\\".The Times, 6 January 1949, report on protest of Mr Mulvey, MP. Reaction The Act created outrage in Ireland because its provisions guaranteed that partition (i.e. the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the UK) would continue unless the Parliament of Northern Ireland chose otherwise.Ireland Act, 1949 Because Northern Ireland had a unionist majority, the guarantee that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK unless the Belfast parliament resolved otherwise copper-fastened the so-called \\"unionist veto\\" in British law. The Irish parliament called for a Protest Against Partition as a result. This was the first and last cross-party declaration against partition by the Irish parliament. The revival of an Irish Republican Army in the early 1950s has been attributed by Irish journalist and popular historian Tim Pat Coogan to the strength of popular feeling among nationalists on both sides of the border against the Act. Before the final Act was published, speculation that the legislation would change the name of \\"Northern Ireland\\" to \\"Ulster\\" was also the subject of adverse reaction from Irish nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Ireland.The Times, 6 January 1949 (report on protest of Mr Mulvey, MP; See also Alternative names for Northern Ireland) ReferencesExternal links Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1949 Category:Constitutional laws of the United Kingdom Category:Constitutional laws of Northern Ireland Category:Immigration to the United Kingdom Category:1949 in law Category:Unionism in the United Kingdom Category:1949 in Northern Ireland Category:1949 in Ireland Category:British nationality law Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning Ireland Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning Northern Ireland Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations ","title":"Ireland Act 1949"},{"id":"1626930","title":"Djibouti Airlines"},{"id":"1626941","text":"Air Guinee Express was an airline based in Conakry, Guinea.

As a young man, he worked with the colonial government in Calcutta, India; in the late 1850s and 1860s he served there in senior-level appointments. Trevelyan was instrumental in the process of reforming the British civil service in the 1850s. Cecil Woodham-Smith wrote of him: > his mind was powerful, his character admirably scrupulous and upright, his > devotion to duty praiseworthy, but he had a remarkable insensitiveness. > Since he took action only after conscientiously satisfying himself what he > proposed to do was ethical and justified he went forward impervious to other > considerations, sustained but also blinded by his conviction of doing right. However this legacy has largely been overshadowed by the controversial role he played in the British government's response to the potato blight in Ireland and the subsequent Great Famine of the 1840s. It has been said that: > Trevelyan's most enduring mark on history may be the \\"quasi\\" genocidal anti- > Irish racial sentiment he expressed during his term in the critical position > of administrating relief for the millions of Irish peasants suffering under > the potato blight as Assistant Secretary to HM Treasury (1840–1859) under > the Whig administration of Lord Russell. During the height of the famine, Trevelyan was slow to disburse direct government food and monetary aid to the Irish due to his strong belief in laissez-faire economics and the free hand of the market.A History of Britain, Simon Schama, 2001 He also wrote highly disparaging remarks about the Irish in a letter to an Irish peer, stating that \\"the judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson\\". Trevelyan never expressed remorse for his comments or actions. His defenders say that larger factors than Trevelyan's own acts and beliefs were more central to the problem of the famine and its high mortality. Origins Descended from an ancient family of Cornwall, he was born in Taunton, Somerset, a son of the Venerable George Trevelyan, then a Cornish clergyman, later Archdeacon of Taunton, the 3rd son of Sir John Trevelyan, 4th Baronet (1735–1828) of Nettlecombe in Somerset. His mother was Harriet Neave, a daughter of Sir Richard Neave, 1st Baronet. Education He was educated at Blundell's School in Devon, at Charterhouse School and then the East India Company College at Haileybury in Hertfordshire. R.A.C. Balfour stated that \\"his early life was influenced by his parents' membership of the Clapham Sect – a group of sophisticated families noted for their severity of principle as much as for their fervent evangelism.\\" Trevelyan was a student of the economist Thomas Malthus while at Haileybury. His rigid adherence to Malthusian population theory during the Irish famine is often attributed to this formative tutelage.Laura Trevelyan, A Very British Family: The Trevelyans and their World. I.B. Taurus, 2006, p. 25 Career John Lawrence, Viceroy of India and other council members. c. 1864 In 1826, as a young man, Trevelyan joined the East India Company as a writer and was posted to the Bengal Civil Service at Delhi, India. There, by a combination of diligence and self-discipline together with his outstanding intellectual talents he achieved rapid promotion. He occupied several important and influential positions in various parts of India, but his priggish and often indiscreet behaviour endeared him to few of his colleagues and involved him in almost continual controversy. On return to Britain in 1840 he was appointed as assistant secretary to HM Treasury, and served to 1859, during both the Irish famine and the Highland Potato Famine of 1846–1857 in Scotland. In Ireland, he administered famine relief, whilst in Scotland he was closely associated with the work of the Central Board for Highland Relief. His (imagined) inaction and (supposed) personal negative attitude towards the Irish people are widely, but erroneously, believed to have slowed relief for the famine. In one letter dated 29 April 1846, Trevelyan wrote: > Our measures must proceed with as little disturbance as possible of the > ordinary course of private trade, which must ever be the chief resource for > the subsistence of the people, but, coûte que coûte (at any cost), the > people must not, under any circumstances, be allowed to starve. Meanwhile, a million starved, and the Irish watched with increasing fury as boatloads of homegrown oats and grain departed on schedule from their shores for shipment to England. Food riots erupted in ports such as Youghal, near Cork, where people tried unsuccessfully to confiscate a boatload of oats. At Dungarvan, in County Waterford, British troops were pelted with stones as they shot into the crowd, killing at least two people and wounding several others. British naval escorts were then provided for the riverboats. He was cofounder in 1851, with Sir John McNeill, of the Highland and Island Emigration Society which during the Highland Clearances supported an exodus of nearly 5,000 people to Australia between 1851 and 1858. Trevelyan was Governor of Madras from 1859 to 1860, and Indian Finance Minister from 1862 to 1865. A reformer of the civil service, he is widely regarded as the founder of the modern British civil service. Marriages and issue He married twice: *Firstly on 23 December 1834, in India, to Hannah More Macaulay (d. 5 August 1873), a sister of Lord Macaulay, then a member of the supreme council of India and one of his closest friends. By his first wife he had one son and heir: **Sir George Otto Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet (1838–1928), the statesman. *Secondly on 14 October 1875 he married Eleanor Anne Campbell, a daughter of Walter Campbell of Islay in Scotland. BiographyIndia= He entered the East India Company's Bengal civil service as a writer in 1826, having displayed from an early age a great proficiency in Asian languages and dialects. On 4 January 1827, Trevelyan was appointed assistant to Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, the commissioner at Delhi, where, during a residence of four years, he was entrusted with the conduct of several important missions. For some time he acted as guardian to the youthful Madhu Singh, the Rajah of Bhurtpore. He also worked to improve the condition of the native population. He abolished the transit duties by which the internal trade of India had long been fettered. For these and other services, he received the special thanks of the governor- general in council. Before leaving Delhi, he donated personal funds for construction of a broad street through a new suburb, then in course of erection, which thenceforth became known as Trevelyanpur. In 1831, he moved to Calcutta, and became deputy secretary to the government in the political department. Trevelyan was especially zealous in the cause of education, and in 1835, largely owing to his persistence, government was led to decide in favour of the promulgation of European literature and science among the Indians. An account of the efforts of government, entitled On the Education of the People of India, was published by Trevelyan in 1838. In April 1836, he was nominated secretary to the Sudder board of revenue, an office he had held until his return in January 1838. =Role in the Irish Famine= On 21 January 1840, he entered on the duties of assistant secretary to Her Majesty's Treasury in London, and discharged the functions of that office for nineteen years. In Ireland he administered the relief works of 1845–47, when upwards of 734,000 men were employed by the government during the Great Famine. Altogether, about a million people in Ireland are reliably estimated to have died of starvation and epidemic disease between 1846 and 1851, and some two million emigrated in a period of a little more than a decade (1845–55). On 27 April 1848 Trevelyan was made a KCB in reward of his services. The Great Famine in Ireland began as a natural catastrophe of extraordinary magnitude, but its effects were severely worsened by the actions and inactions of the Whig government, headed by Lord John Russell in the crucial years from 1846 to 1852. Many members of the British upper and middle classes believed that the famine was a divine judgment—an act of Providence. A leading exponent of the providentialist perspective was Trevelyan, who was chiefly responsible for administering Irish relief policy throughout the famine years. In his book The Irish Crisis, published in 1848, Trevelyan later described the famine as \\"a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence\\", one which laid bare \\"the deep and inveterate root of social evil\\". The famine, he declared, was \\"the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected… God grant that the generation to which this great opportunity has been offered may rightly perform its part…\\" This mentality of Trevelyan's was influential in persuading the government to do nothing to restrain mass evictions. During the Great Famine, specifically 1846, the Whig–Liberal Government held power in Britain, with Trevelyan acting as treasurer. In this position Trevelyan had considerable influence over the parliament's decisions, especially the plans for the relief effort in Ireland. Along with the Whig government, he believed Ireland needed to correct itself and that a laissez-faire attitude was the best solution. Though the efforts made by Trevelyan did not produce any permanent remedy to the situation, he believed that if the British Government gave Ireland all that was necessary to survive, the Irish people would come to rely on the British government instead of fixing their problems. In the summer of 1846, Trevelyan ordered the Peelite Relief Programmes, which had been operating since the early years of the famine, to be shut down. This was done on 21 July 1846 by Sir Charles Wood. Trevelyan believed that if the relief continued while a new food crisis was unfolding, the poor would become permanently conditioned to having the state take care of them. After the end of the Peelite Relief Programs, the Whig–Liberal government instituted the Labour Rate Act, which provided aid only to the most severely affected areas of the famine. This Labour Act took time to be implemented, as was Trevelyan's intention, allowing Britain to spend the bare minimum to feed those starving from the famine. He was nicknamed as \\"lynchpin of relief operations\\". Trevelyan believed that labourers should have seen this as a happy event to take advantage of what he called \\"breathing-time\\" to harvest their own crops and carry out wage-producing harvest work for large farmers. But the return of the blight had deprived labourers of any crops to harvest and farmers of agricultural work to hire labourers for. Trevelyan expressed his views in letters that year to Lord Monteagle of Brandon and in an article in The Times. But in 1846 more than ninety percent of the potato crop had been destroyed. It is important to note that the large crops of oats and grain were not affected, and if those crops had been distributed to the Irish people rather than exported, mass starvation could have been avoided. Trevelyan wrote to Lord Monteagle of Brandon, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the famine was an \\"effective mechanism for reducing surplus population\\", and was \\"the judgement of God\\". Further he wrote that \\"The real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the Famine, but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people\\". Trevelyan said in his 9 October 1846 letter to Lord Monteagle that \\"the government establishments are strained to the utmost to alleviate this great calamity and avert this danger\\" as was within their power so to do.\\"Letter of Trevelyan to Lord Monteagle,\\" (9 October 1846) in Kissane (ed.), p. 51 Trevelyan praised the government and denounced the Irish gentry in his letter, blaming them for the famine. He believed that the landlords were responsible to feed the labourers and increase land productivity. The Times agreed with Trevelyan, faulting the gentry for not instructing their proprietors to improve their estates and not planting crops other than the potato.Times newspaper (22 September 1846), in Gray, pp. 154-55 In his letter to Lord Monteagle, Trevelyan identified the gentry with the \\"defective part of the national character\\" and chastised them for expecting the government to fix everything, \\"as if they have themselves no part to perform in this great crisis.\\" By blaming the famine on the gentry, Trevelyan justified the actions—or inaction—of the British Government. These same gentry were of course raising the crops of oats and grains as well as meat that were exported by the tonne under armed guard to England. The potato blight eventually spread to the Western Highlands of Scotland, causing similar destitution and deaths. In 1851, in response to that crisis, Trevelyan and Sir John McNeill founded the Highland and Island Emigration Society. From 1851 until its termination in 1858, the society sponsored the emigration of around 5,000 Scots to Australia and thus increasing the devastation of the Clearances. =Civil Service Reform= In 1853, Trevelyan proposed the organisation of a new system for hiring of people in the government civil service. The Northcote–Trevelyan Report, signed by himself and Sir Stafford Northcote in November 1853, entitled The Organisation of the Permanent Civil Service, laid the foundation for securing the admission of qualified and educated persons into positions that had been dominated by members of aristocratic and influential families who benefitted by personal networks. It was intended to be a merit system. =Return to India= In 1858, Lord Harris resigned the governorship of the presidency of Madras, and Trevelyan was offered the appointment. Having maintained his knowledge of oriental affairs by close attention to all subjects affecting the interest of India, he entered upon his duties as governor of Madras in the spring of 1859. He soon became popular in the presidency. Believed due to his conduct in office, the natives became reconciled to the government. An assessment was carried out, a police system organised in every part, and, contrary to the traditions of the East India Company, land was sold in fee simple to any one who wished to purchase. These and other reforms introduced or developed by Trevelyan won the gratitude and esteem of the Madras population. All went well until February 1860. Towards the close of 1859, James Wilson had been appointed financial member of the legislative council of India. At the beginning of the new year, he proposed a plan of retrenchment and taxation by which he hoped to improve the financial position of the British administration: his plan was introduced at Calcutta, the seat of government, on 18 February, and transmitted to Madras. On 4 March, an open telegram was sent to Calcutta implying an adverse opinion of this proposal by the governor and council of Madras. On 9 March, a letter was sent to Madras stating the central government's objection to the transmission of such a message in an open telegram at a time when native feeling could not be considered stable. At the same time, the representative of the Madras government in the legislative council of India was prohibited from following the instructions of his superiors to lay their views upon the table and to advocate on their behalf. On 21 March, the government sent another telegram to Madras declaring the bill would be introduced and referred to a committee which was due to report in five weeks. On 26 March, opinions among Trevelyan and his council were recorded and, on his authority, the document found its way into the papers. On arrival of this intelligence in Britain, the Governor of Madras was at once recalled. This decision occasioned much discussion both in and out of Parliament. Defending the recall of Trevelyan, Palmerston, in his place in parliament, said: Sir Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control, said: In 1862, Trevelyan returned to India as finance minister. His tenure of office was marked by important administrative reforms and by extensive measures for the development of natural resources in India by means of public works. In 1862, Colonel Douglas Hamilton was given a roving commission by Trevelyan to conduct surveys and make drawings for the Government of all the hill plateaus in Southern India which were likely to suit as Sanitaria, or quarters for European troops. On his return home in 1865, Trevelyan became engaged in discussions of the question of army purchase, on which he had given evidence before the royal commission in 1857. Later he was associated with a variety of social questions, such as charities, pauperism, and the like, and in the treatment of these. He was a staunch Liberal, and gave his support to the Liberal cause in Northumberland, while residing at Wallington Hall in that county. Trevelyan died at 67 Eaton Square, London, on 19 June 1886, aged 79. Legacy and honours Trevelyan was appointed KCB on 27 April 1848. Three decades later on 2 March 1874, he was created the first Trevelyan baronet, of Wallington. When his cousin Walter Calverley Trevelyan, 6th Baronet, of Nettlecombe, died at Wallington on 23 March 1879, he was childless after two marriages. He bequeathed his north- country property to Charles. A biographer from the family notes that Walter had changed his will in 1852, having been impressed by Charles' son. The young George Otto Trevelyan had visited Walter and his wife and received hints of the secret will. The modest social position of the family was suddenly elevated to one of wealth and property, recorded as an important event in the history of the baronetcy. The changed will came as a surprise to Alfred Trevelyan, who was advised at the end of a lengthy letter that detailed the evils of alcohol. He issued a costly and unsuccessful challenge for the title and estate. The Trevelyan (Charles Edward) Archive, which includes Trevelyan's papers covering 25 years of his personal life and career, is held at Newcastle University Library Special Collections and Archives. Publications In addition to works mentioned, Trevelyan wrote the following: * The Application of the Roman Alphabet to all the Oriental Languages, 1834; 3rd ed. 1858. * A Report upon the Inland Customs and Town Duties of the Bengal Presidency, 1834. * The Irish Crisis, 1848; 2nd ed. 1880. * The Army Purchase Question and Report and Evidence of the Royal Commission considered, 1858. * The Purchase System in the British Army, 1867; 2nd ed. 1867. * The British Army in 1868, 1868; 4th ed. 1868. * A Standing or a Popular Army, 1869. * Three Letters on the Devonshire Labourer, 1869. * From Pesth to Brindisi, being Notes of a Tour, 1871; 2nd ed. 1876. * The Compromise offered by Canada in reference to the reprinting of English Books, 1872. * Christianity and Hinduism contrasted, 1882. Trevelyan's letters to the Times, with the signature of Indophilus, were collected with Additional Notes in 1857; 3rd edit. 1858. Several of his addresses, letters, and speeches were also published. In conjunction with his cousin, Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan, he edited the Trevelyan Papers (Camden Society 1856, 1862, 1872).

In addition they offered Voice over IP, T1, Web hosting, managed security, IP and dial-up, and bundled voice and data services directly through Covad's network and through Internet Service Providers, value-added resellers, telecommunications carriers and affinity groups to businesses. Covad broadband services were available in 44 states, including 235 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), a services area available to over 50 percent of all businesses. The company was founded in San Jose, CA. By 2008, Covad added the Samsung Acemap DSLAM to their portfolio on top of their pre-existing Nokia D50 DSLAMs, to allow for ADSL2+ technology, which can reach DSL speeds up to 15 Mbit/s. The launch of the AceMAP was primarily instigated to provide combined POTS and ADSL2+ service to Earthlink end users and were deployed in more residential areas instead of concentrating on business-centric markets. Covad was acquired by private equity firm, Platinum Equity in April 2008. In 2010, it was sold to U.S. Venture Partners, which merged Covad, and Speakeasy into MegaPath. The three-way merger produced an executive team comprising the former CEOs of all three former companies: Chairman and CEO (former MegaPath CEO) D. Craig Young, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Wholesale Markets (former Covad CEO) Pat Bennett, and (former Speakeasy CEO) Bruce Chatterley as President of the Business Markets unit in charge of all non-wholesale customer sales, service and marketing. In mid-2010, Covad announced Ethernet over Copper services (EoCu) in the LA market. The new Ethernet product ran over a Fujitsu Flashwave based Ethernet core and provided symmetrical speeds up to 20 Mbit/s. Ethernet over DS1 service was added soon after. In early 2011, Covad (now as Megapath) announced expansion of the services on a national level by the end of 2012. In September 2014, Global Capacity announced its plan to buy the assets acquired from Covad from MegaPath. The acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 6, 1990. In the episode, Bart decides he wants to become a daredevil after watching famous stunt performer Lance Murdock at a monster truck rally. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and directed by Wes Archer. Series creator Matt Groening said that the episode is his favorite of the series, and it is also considered among the series' best by several critics. Plot The Simpsons attend a monster truck rally featuring Truckasaurus, a giant robotic dinosaur that crushes their car when they accidentally drive into the arena. The rally's grand finale features a death-defying stunt by legendary daredevil Lance Murdock. The stunt leaves Murdock badly injured and hospitalized (he did succeed but his bike fell into the tank when he was waving to the audience), but it inspires Bart to be a daredevil. Bart injures himself trying to jump the family car on his skateboard. At the hospital, Dr. Hibbert shows Bart a ward full of children who have been hurt by dangerous stunts. Undeterred, Bart keeps performing daredevil stunts. During a class trip to Springfield Gorge, Bart announces he will jump the gorge on his skateboard the next Saturday. Lisa persuades him to visit Murdock at the hospital, hoping he will discourage Bart from jumping the gorge. Instead Murdock encourages Bart to be a daredevil. Homer insists jumping the gorge is too dangerous and forbids Bart to do it. None of Homer's punishments or arguments dissuade Bart, who goes to the gorge that Saturday. As Bart is about to start his stunt, Homer arrives and decides to jump the gorge himself to show him what it feels like to see a family member unnecessarily risking their life. Not wanting to see his father die on his account, Bart abandons the stunt and promises to stop being a daredevil. When Homer hugs Bart, his skateboard accidentally rolls down a hill and flies over the gorge. At first it appears Homer will make it safely across, but he loses momentum and plunges onto several jagged rocks during his fall until he hits the bottom. Homer is airlifted into an ambulance, which crashes into a tree, causing him to fall down the gorge a second time. He eventually shares a hospital room with Murdock. Production Lance Murdock was based on alt=A man in a caped uniform standing next to a bicycle The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and directed by Wes Archer. The character Lance Murdock was based on Evel Knievel, an American motorcycle daredevil and entertainer famous in the United States and elsewhere between the late 1960s and early 1980s. Kogen, Wolodarsky, and many other members of the Simpsons staff were fans of Knievel's stunts, and Wolodarsky named \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" as his favorite episode among the episodes that he wrote for The Simpsons, because it is \\"near and dear to [his] heart\\". Dr. Hibbert makes his first appearance on the series in the episode. In Kogen and Wolodarsky's original script for \\"Bart the Daredevil\\", Hibbert was a woman named Julia Hibbert, who they named after comedic actress Julia Sweeney (Hibbert was her last name, through marriage, at the time). When the Fox network moved The Simpsons to prime time on Thursdays to compete against the National Broadcasting Company's (NBC) top-rated The Cosby Show, the writing staff instead decided to make Hibbert a parody of Bill Cosby's character Dr. Cliff Huxtable. The episode was originally too short to air, so Al Jean and Mike Reiss wrote a filler piece which was a parody of cartoon shorts from the 1940s called \\"Nazis on Tap.\\" In the short, amongst other things, Mr. Burns would be making planes for the war effort at his aircraft plant, Bart's spiky hair would be replaced by a pointy Jughead cap and Moe Szyslak would be a dog. Matt Groening thought the piece was too weird and nixed it, thinking it was too early in the series to present something so offbeat to the audience. Audio from the piece was released online by Simpsons storyboard artist John Mathot in 2006. Simpsons character designer Phil Ortiz adapted the short as a four- page comic book and handed out copies at Wizard World Philadelphia on June 2, 2016. The music video for the \\"Do the Bartman\\" single premiered after this episode. =Springfield Gorge scene= The episode has been referenced in numerous clip shows and flashback episodes throughout the series. In particular, the scene of Homer plummeting down Springfield Gorge has become one of the most used The Simpsons clips. In the scene, Homer falls down the cliff on the skateboard, bouncing off the cliff walls and finally landing at the bottom, where the skateboard lands on his head. After being loaded into an ambulance at the top of the cliff, the ambulance crashes into a tree, and the gurney rolls out, causing Homer to fall down the cliff again. The scene was first featured outside of \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" in the season four episode \\"So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show\\". When the clip is shown in that episode, additional footage is seen of Homer bouncing down the cliff the second time, and after he lands at the bottom, the gurney lands on his head. Contrary to popular belief, the second fall down the gorge (ending with Homer getting hit by the gurney) was not a deleted scene from \\"Bart the Daredevil\\", but rather a scene animated exclusively for the clip show. The scene is also referenced in the \\"behind the scenes\\" parody episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\" from season eleven. The scene, which also features added more graphic animation of Homer hitting the jagged rocks at the bottom of gorge, is followed by his recovery from the fall where he becomes addicted to painkillers. In the season thirteen episode \\"The Blunder Years\\", when the family is trying to find out why Homer cannot stop screaming after he is hypnotized, Homer flashes back to his greatest moment: jumping the Springfield Gorge, only to be interrupted by Lisa saying \\"Everyone's sick of that memory,\\" referring to the fact that the scene has been referenced so many times.McCann, p. 21. The scene is also referenced in the season fourteen episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XIII\\", in which a large number of Homer's clones created in the episode fall down the gorge.McCann, p. 65. \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" was once again referenced in The Simpsons Movie when Bart and Homer jump over Springfield Gorge on a motorcycle, and when they land on the other side, the ambulance from this episode can be seen in the background (still smashed against the tree). It is also referenced in the Family Guy season thirteen episode \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", where Homer and Peter Griffin fell down to Earth in Kang and Kodos' ship and jump the gorge during their fight. Cultural references Snake River Canyon. alt=A canyon with land covered in a mix of grass and sand At the beginning of the episode, Lisa, Bart and Bart's friends watch professional wrestling. The Russian wrestler in the ring, Rasputin, is named after mystic Grigori Rasputin. The monster truck at the rally, Truckasaurus, is a parody of the Robosaurus monster truck. In the hospital, Dr. Hibbert shows Bart a patient who tried to fly like Superman, and he also mentions the \\"three stooges\\" ward. Lance Murdock is a parody of famous daredevils such as Evel Knievel and Matt Murdock, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil. Bart's attempt to jump over Springfield Gorge is a reference to Knievel's 1974 attempt to jump Snake River Canyon at Twin Falls, Idaho, with a Skycycle X-2. Bart appearing at Springfield Gorge in the distance is based on Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" finished 20th in Nielsen ratings for the week of December 3–9, 1990, making The Simpsons the highest-rated television series on the Fox network that week. To promote The Simpsons Sing the Blues, the music video for the album's lead single, \\"Do the Bartman\\", premiered shortly after this episode's first broadcast. In an interview conducted by Entertainment Weekly in 2000 celebrating the show's tenth anniversary, Groening named \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" his favorite episode of the series, and chose the scene in which Homer is loaded into an ambulance and then falls out of it as the funniest moment in the series. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked it as the third best in the show's history. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode, and referred to its opening by claiming that \\"any episode that starts with the brilliance that is Truckasaurus has to be good.\\" He liked the decent morals explored in the episode, and called the conclusion a \\"great one\\", making it a \\"consistently fine episode\\". Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk considered \\"Bart the Daredevil\\" one of his favorite episodes of the season. He found the daredevil scenes to be funny, but also appreciated the episode's scenes with \\"true heart\\". Kleinman concluded by noting that the episode helps The Simpsons stand apart from other animated and live action sitcoms by focusing more on the relationships between the characters than \\"just a humorous weekly plotline\\". In his book Doug Pratt's DVD, DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor Doug Pratt chooses the episode as one of the funniest of the series. Writing for the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Simpsons writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky noted that \\"Bart the Daredevil\\"'s sequence in which Homer falls down the gorge is the one that \\"everyone remembers\\", noting that \\"he's getting much stupider by this point.\\" Kogen also considers the episode to be his favorite of the ones he has written.

It was Murphy's second feature stand-up comedy film, following Eddie Murphy Delirious. However, unlike Delirious, Raw received a wide theatrical release. The 90-minute show was filmed at the Felt Forum, a venue in the Madison Square Garden complex in New York City. The film was released in the United States on December 18, 1987. , it is the highest- grossing stand-up comedy concert film of all time at the box office, making $50.5 million in the United States and Canada. Plot The film opens with a pre-taped sketch depicting a scene from Murphy's childhood. At a family Thanksgiving in November 1968, the children take turns showing their talents to the assembled relatives (including one played by Murphy himself). Young Eddie (Deon Richmond) shocks the family with a rude joke about a monkey and a lion. After emerging on stage for the live show, Murphy begins by discussing the angry reactions of celebrities parodied in his previous stand-up show, Delirious, specifically Mr. T and Michael Jackson, as well as homosexual viewers offended by his jokes about \\"faggots.\\" Murphy then narrates a phone call he received from Bill Cosby chastising him for using profanity on stage. Angered by Cosby's assumption that his entire act was nothing but \\"filth foul filth,\\" Murphy calls Richard Pryor for advice. Pryor declares that his only concerns should be making audiences laugh and getting paid, and recommends that he tell Cosby to \\"Have a Coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.\\" Murphy elaborates on his admiration for the \\"raw\\" comedy of Pryor, running through a routine from his own teenage years about defecation, in Pryor's voice. He then goes on to talk about how people who don't speak English only pick up the curse words in his act, and shout them at him on the street. Next comes a lengthy routine about dating and relationships. Murphy explains that the rise of deadly sexually transmitted infections has motivated him to seek marriage, but the divorce of Johnny Carson and Joanna Holland (in which she sought 50% of his assets) has left him paranoid about the financial risk of marriage, concluding that \\"no pussy is worth $150 million.\\" He mocks the aggression and materialism of American women (compared to his believed meekness of Japanese women), referring to the popularity of Janet Jackson's song \\"What Have You Done for Me Lately.\\" He jokes that he intends to go deep into Africa to find a \\"bush bitch\\" who has no concept of Western culture... at least until American women convince her to stand up for herself and demand \\"HALF!\\" This develops into a broader warning to men to avoid \\"the pussy trap,\\" and a warning to women that men never remain faithful — once a man has evoked a powerful orgasm from a woman (\\"ooohhhh!\\") she will tolerate all kinds of misbehavior, although she may pursue infidelity of her own. The next segment narrates a childhood memory of his mother promising to cook him a hamburger \\"better than McDonald's,\\" only to produce an unappealing \\"welfare burger,\\" a lump of beef filled with onion and green peppers on Wonder Bread (while the neighborhood children show off their McDonald's hamburgers in a call-back to the ice cream segment of Delirious), but he states that as an adult, he has more of an appreciation of the tastiness of his mom's homemade dish. Murphy then talks about white people out on the town, criticizing their embarrassing dance moves, leading onto Italian-Americans being inspired by Rocky, then culminates to a bit about fighting in a discotheque with Deney Terrio, eventually starting a large-scale brawl after which \\"everybody sued me\\" for millions of dollars. After the fight, Murphy calls his parents, leading to a long impression of his drunken stepfather (another call-back to a popular bit from Delirious). This final segment runs for over 10 minutes and incorporates his stepfather's habit of misquoting Motown songs (including \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\", which opened the film).

He had also worked in the advertising, aviation and journalism industry, writing for Dawn, The Pakistan Times, Morning News and The Guardian, London. He is best known for his cricket writings and commentary but he was also a keen observer of political and social developments and wrote about them, in his own words, not with fury, but certainly with \\"exasperation and anger\\". He died of heart disease on 14 March 2005, at the age of 77, leaving behind his widow, a son, Javed, and two grandchildren. He was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Excellence) in 2001 by the President of Pakistan.  Family background and education  Kureishi's father, M. A. Kureishi, was a member of the Indian Medical Service. He had 11 siblings and his family was frequently on the move because of their father's many postings across pre-partition India. Omar Kureishi took a degree in International Relations from the University of Southern California in the early 1950s. He has one son, Javed Kureishi, and two grandchildren, Saif and Tanya Kureishi. Omar Kureishi was a classmate of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in school in Mumbai and later at USC.  Life as a journalist, writer and socialite  Kureishi briefly worked with a radio station and also played a small part in a Hollywood movie. He came to Karachi in the mid-1950s and joined the defunct Pakistan Standard. Later, he became resident editor of the Times of Karachi. His brother, Sattoo Kureishi, lived near Karachi airport in a house called Air Cottage, where he used to hold regular weekly get-togethers. \\"Friday Evenings at Air Cottage\\" became a byword in Karachi's intellectual and avant-grade circles, and Omar Kureishi soon became an integral part of the set. He filed dispatches for many newspapers in Pakistan and abroad during his cricket commentating career, but he wrote most regularly for Dawn for a period spanning over 25 years. He did columns based on cricket, as well as those based on his memories of his time abroad in the US and traveling around the cricket world, in addition to his time in Mumbai and Delhi. His books include Black Moods, Out to Lunch, The System, The Other Side of Daylight, As Time Goes By and Once Upon a Time.  Life as cricket commentator  Kureishi's devotion to cricket, in his own words, started as \\"a passion\\" and eventually became \\"a love affair\\" which \\"remained a constant\\" in his life through all its \\"ups and downs\\". Though he had never played first- class or Test cricket (his only exposure to competitive cricket at an organised level was a brief stint in club cricket in the UK when he went there during his life as student), he was recognised as an outstanding and extremely knowledgeable cricket commentator. He shared the Test Match Special commentary box during Pakistan's early tours to England and together with Jamsheed Marker, he was a regular voice on the airwaves in Pakistan during the late 1950s and '60s. Bill Frindall, the TMS statistician, described him as \\"a lively, witty and popular colleague\\" and called him \\"the voice of Asian sport\\". Omar Kureishi counted many cricketers, most notably Abdul Hafeez Kardar, as his close friends. The media centre at the Qadhafi Stadium in Lahore is named after him. He was also a member of the International Cricket Council panel that selects the world's best Test and one-day international players for its annual awards. He managed the Pakistan cricket tours to England in 1974 and New Zealand in 1978–79.Wisden 2006, p. 1512.

The species has been recovered from Taung and the Cradle of Humankind at Sterkfontein, Makapansgat, and Gladysvale. The first specimen, Taung child, was described by anatomist Raymond Dart in 1924, and was the first early hominin found. However, its closer relations to humans than to other apes would not become widely accepted until the middle of the century because most had believed humans evolved outside of Africa principally due to the hoax transitional fossil Piltdown Man from Britain. It is unclear how A. africanus relates to other hominins, being variously placed as ancestral to Homo and Paranthropus, to just Paranthropus, or to just P. robustus. The specimen \\"Little Foot\\" is the most completely preserved early hominin, with 90% intact, and the oldest South African australopith, but it is controversially suggested this and similar specimens be split off into \\"A. prometheus\\". A. africanus brain volume was about . Like other early hominins, the cheek teeth were enlarged and had thick enamel. Male skulls may have been more robust than female skulls. Males may have been on average in height and in weight, and females and . A. africanus was a competent biped, though was less efficient at walking than humans. A. africanus also has several commonalities in the upper body with arboreal non-human apes, which is either interpreted as evidence of an at least partially arboreal lifestyle or nonfunctional traits inherited from more apelike ancestors. The upper body of A. africanus is more apelike than that of the East African A. afarensis. A. africanus, unlike most other primates, seems to have exploited C4 foods such as grasses, seeds, rhizomes, underground storage organs, or creatures which eat those such as locusts, termites, grazing mammals, or even animals which eat those creatures. Nonetheless, the species had a highly variable diet, making it a generalist. It may have eaten lower quality, harder foods, such as nuts, in leaner times. To survive, children may have needed nursing during such periods until reaching perhaps 4 to 5 years of age. The species appears to have been patrifocal, with females more likely to leave the group than males. A. africanus lived in a gallery forest surrounded by more open grasslands or bushlands. South African australopithecine remains probably accumulated in caves due to predation by large carnivores (namely big cats), and Taung child appears to have been killed by a bird of prey. A. africanus probably went extinct due to major climatic variability and volatility and possibly competition with Homo and P. robustus. Research history Cast of Taung child from the collection of the University of the Witwatersrand In 1924, South African anatomist Raymond Dart and Scottish geologist Robert Burns Young were called to a limestone quarry in Taung, South Africa, by the Northern Lime Company to collect monkey fossils. They suspected the area might bear archaic human remains like Homo rhodesiensis from Kabwe, Zambia (at the time Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia) discovered in 1921. Instead, they recovered a 2.8 million year old juvenile skull, Taung child, seemingly a transitional fossil between apes and humans. Most notably, it had a small brain size yet was apparently bipedal. Dart named the specimen Australopithecus africanus. At this time, great apes were classified into the family Pongidae encompassing all non-human fossil apes, and Hominidae encompassing humans and ancestors. Dart felt Taung child fit into neither, and erected the family \\"Homo-simiadæ\\" (\\"man-ape\\"). This family name was soon abandoned, and Dart proposed \\"Australopithecidae\\" in 1929. In 1933, South African palaeoanthropologist Robert Broom suggested moving A. africanus into Hominidae containing, at the time, only humans and ancestors. A. africanus was the first evidence that humans evolved in Africa, as Charles Darwin had postulated in his 1871 The Descent of Man. However, Dart's claim of Taung child as the transitional stage between apes and humans was at odds with the then popular model of human evolution which held that large brain size and humanlike characteristics had developed rather early on, and that large brain size evolved before bipedalism. Resultantly, A. africanus was generally cast aside as a member of the gorilla or chimp lineages, most notably by Sir Arthur Keith. This view was perpetuated by Charles Dawson's 1912 hoax Piltdown Man hailing from Britain. Further, the discovery of the humanlike Peking Man (Homo erectus pekinensis) in China seemed to place the origins of humankind in Asia instead of Africa. Humanlike characteristics of Taung child were attributed to the specimen's juvenile status, meaning they would disappear with maturity. Nonetheless, Dart and Broom continued to argue that Australopithecus was far removed from chimps, showing several physical and claiming some behavioural similarities with humans. To this extent, Dart made note of the amalgamations of large mammal bone fragments in australopithecine-bearing caves which are now attributed to hyena activity, but Dart proposed that the bones were evidence of what he named the \\"osteodontokeratic culture\\" produced by australopithecine hunters, manufacturing weapons using the long bones, teeth, and horns of large hoofed prey: Mrs. Ples at the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, Pretoria Broom set out to find an adult specimen, which he discovered in Sterkfontein Cave in 1936. However, he classified it as a new species, \\"A. transvaalensis\\", and in 1938 moved it into a new genus as \\"Plesianthropus transvaalensis\\". He also discovered the robust australopithecine Paranthropus robustus, showing evidence of a wide diversity of Early Pleistocene \\"man-apes\\". Before World War II, several more sites bore A. africanus fossils. A detailed monograph by Broom and palaeoanthropologist Gerrit Willem Hendrik Schepers in 1946 regarding these australopithecines from South Africa, as well as several papers by British palaeoanthropologist Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, had turned around scientific opinion, garnering wide support for A. africanus classification as a human ancestor. In 1947, the most complete skull was discovered, STS 5 (\\"Mrs. Ples\\"). Wider acceptance of A. africanus prompted re-evaluation of Piltdown Man in 1953 and again in 1955, revealing its falsehood. In 1949, Dart recommended splitting a presumed-female facial fragment from Makapansgat, South Africa, (MLD 2) into a new species as \\"A. prometheus\\". In 1954, he referred another presumed-female specimen from Makapansgat (a jawbone fragment). However, in 1953, South African palaeontologist John Talbot Robinson believed that splitting species and genera on such fine hairs was unjustified, and that australopithecine remains from East Africa recovered over the previous couple of decades were indistinguishable from \\"Plesianthropus\\"/A. africanus. Based on this, in 1955, Dart agreed with synonymising \\"A. prometheus\\" with A. africanus because if speciation did not occur across a continent, then it quite unlikely occurred over a couple tens of kilometres (the East African remains would be split off into A. afarensis in 1978). In 2008, palaeoanthropologist Ronald J. Clarke recommended reviving \\"A. prometheus\\" to house the StW 573 nearly-complete skeleton (\\"Little Foot\\"), StS 71 cranium, StW 505 cranium, StW 183 maxilla, StW 498 maxilla and jawbone, StW 384 jawbone, StS 1 palate, and MLD 2. The validity of this is debated. At the time, these remains were dated to 3.3 million years ago in the Late Pliocene. In 2019, Clarke and South African palaeoanthropologist Kathleen Kuman redated StW 573 to 3.67 million years ago, making it the oldest Australopithecus specimen from South Africa. They considered its antiquity further evidence of species distinction, drawing parallels with A. anamensis and A. afarensis from Middle Pliocene East Africa. Little foot is the most complete early hominin skeleton ever recovered, with about 90% preserved. Locations of A. africanus discoveries In addition to Taung, Sterkfontein, and Makapansgat, A. africanus was in 1992 discovered in Gladysvale Cave. The latter three are in the Cradle of Humankind. Many hominin specimens traditionally assigned to A. africanus have been recovered from Sterkfontein Member 4 (including Mrs. Ples and 2 partial skeletons) dating from 2.8–2.15 million years ago, and it is the most productive Australopithecus-bearing deposit. However, given the wide range of variation exhibited by these specimens, it is debated if all these elements can be confidently assigned to only A. africanus. At present, the classification of australopithecines is in disarray. Australopithecus is considered a grade taxon whose members are united by their similar physiology rather than close relations with each other over other hominin genera. It is unclear how A. africanus relates to other hominins. The discovery of Early Pleistocene Homo in Africa during the latter half of the 20th century placed humanity's origins on the continent and A. africanus as ancestral to Homo. The discovery of A. afarensis in 1978, at the time the oldest known hominin, prompted a hypothesis that A. africanus was ancestral to P. robustus, and A. afarensis was the last common ancestor between Homo and A. africanus/P. robustus. It is also suggested that A. africanus is closely related to P. robustus but not to the other Paranthropus species in East Africa, or that A. africanus is ancestral to all Paranthropus. A. africanus has also been postulated to have been ancestral to A. sediba which also inhabited the Cradle of Humankind, perhaps contemporaneously. A. sediba is also postulated to have been ancestral to Homo, which if correct would indeed put A. africanus in an ancestral position to Homo. AnatomySkull= Reconstructed skull of Mrs. Ples at the Beijing Museum of Natural History Based on 4 specimens, the A. africanus brain volume averaged about . Based on this, neonatal brain size was estimated to have been using trends seen in adult and neonate brain size in modern primates. If correct, this would indicate that A. africanus was born with about 38% of its total brain size, which is more similar to non-human great apes at 40% than humans at 30%. The inner ear has wide semicircular canals like non-human apes, as well as loose turns at the terminal end of the cochlea like humans. Such a mix may reflect habitual locomotion both in the trees and walking while upright because inner ear anatomy affects the vestibular system (sense of balance). A. africanus had a prognathic jaw (it jutted out), a somewhat dished face (the cheek were inflated, causing the nose to be at the bottom of a dip), and a defined brow ridge. The temporal lines running across either side of the braincase are raised as small crests. The canines are reduced in size compared to non-human apes, thought still notably bigger than those of modern humans. Like other early hominins, the cheek teeth are large and feature thick enamel. In the upper jaw the third molar is the largest molar, and in the lower jaw it is the second molar. A. africanus had a fast ape-like dental development rate. According to Clarke, the older \\"A. prometheus\\" is distinguished by larger and more bulbous cheek teeth, larger incisors and canines, more projecting cheeks, more widely spaced eye sockets, and a sagittal crest. A. africanus has a wide range of variation for skull features, which is typically attributed to moderate to high levels of sexual dimorphism in that males were more robust than females. =Build= In 1992, American anthropologist Henry McHenry estimated an average weight (when assuming humanlike or apelike body proportions, respectively) of for males based on 5 partial leg specimens, and for females based on 7 specimens. In 2015, American anthropologist William L. Jungers and colleagues similarly reported an average weight (without attempting to distinguish males from females) of with a range of for weight based on 19 specimens. Based on 7 specimens, McHenry estimated that males, on average, grew to tall and females . In 2017, based on 24 specimens, anthropologist Manuel Will and colleagues estimated a height of with a range of . The elderly, probably female StW 573 was estimated to have stood about . Based on the A. afarensis skeleton DIK-1-1, australopiths are thought to have had a humanlike spine, with 7 neck vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and (based on other early australopith skeletons) 5 flexible lumbar vertebrae. In StW 573, the atlas bone in the neck, important for swiveling and stabalising the head, is more similar to non-human apes and indicates greater mobility to swivel up and down than in humans. Such motion is important for arboreal species to locate and focus on climbable surfaces. The StW 573 atlas shows similar mechanical advantages for the muscles which move the shoulder girdle as chimps and gorillas, which may indicate less lordosis (normal curvature of the spine) in A. africanus neck vertebrae. However, the later StW 679 has some similarities to human atlases, which could potentially indicate gradual evolution away from the ape condition. StW 573 has a narrow thoracic inlet unlike A. afarensis and humans, though the clavicle is proportionally quite long, with a similar absolute length to that of modern humans. Sts 14 sacrum Like in modern women, L3–L5 curve outwards in specimen StS 14, whereas these are straighter in StW 431 as in modern men. This probably reflects reinforcement of the female spine to aid in walking upright while pregnant. The StS 14 partial skeleton preserves a rather complete pelvis. Like in the restored pelvis of the Lucy specimen (A. afarensis), the sacrum was relatively flat and orientated more towards the back than in humans, and the pelvic cavity had an overall platypelloid shape. This could indicate a broad birth canal compared to neonate head size, and thus a non-rotational birth (unlike humans), though this is debated. When standing, the angle between the sacrum and the lumbar vertebrae was reconstructed to have been about 148.7°, which is much more similar to that of chimps (154.6°) than humans (118.3°). This would indicate A. africanus standing posture was not as erect as in humans. =Limbs= The A. africanus hand and arm exhibit a mosaic anatomy with some aspects more similar to humans and others to non-human apes. It is unclear if this means australopiths were still arboreal to a degree, or if these traits were simply inherited from the human–chimp last common ancestor. Nonetheless, A. africanus exhibits a more ape-like upper limb anatomy than A. afarensis, and is typically interpreted as having been, to some extent, arboreal. Like in arboreal primates, the fingers are curved, the arms relatively long and the shoulders are in a shrugging position. The A. africanus shoulder is most like that of orangutans, and well suited for maintaining stability and bearing weight while raised and placed overhead. However, the right clavicle of StW 573 has a distinctly S-shaped (sigmoid) curve like humans, which indicates a humanlike moment arm for stabilising the shoulder girdle against the humerus. The A. africanus arm bones are consistent with powerful muscles useful in climbing. Nonetheless, the brachial index (the forearm to humerus ratio) is 82.8–86.2 (midway between chimps and humans), which indicates a reduction in forearm length from the more ancient hominin Ardipithecus ramidus. The thumb and wrist indicate humanlike functionality with a precision grip and forceful opposition between the thumb and fingers. The adoption of such a grip is typically interpreted as an adaptation for tool making at the expense of efficient climbing and arboreal habitation. The leg bones clearly show that A. africanus habitually engaged in bipedal locomotion, though some aspects of the tibiae are apelike, which could indicate that the leg musculature had not been fully reorganised into the human condition. If correct, its functional implications are unclear. The trabecular bone at the hip joint is distinctly humanlike, which would be inconsistent with the great degrees of hip loading required in prolonged arboreal activity. The tibia met the foot at a similar angle as it does in humans, which is necessary for habitual bipedalism. Consequently, the ankle was not as adept for climbing activities as it is in non-human apes. However, the modern Congo Twa hunter–gatherers can achieve a chimp-like angle with the ankle while climbing trees due to the longer fibres in the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle instead of specific skeletal adaptations. Some aspects of the ankle bone were apelike which may have affected walking efficiency. The foot elements of A. africanus are largely known from remains from Sterkfontein Member 4. The foot is humanlike with a stiff midfoot and lack of a midtarsal break (which allows non-human apes to lift the heel independently from the rest of the foot). Though A. africanus had an adducted big toe (it was not dextrous) like humans, A. africanus likely did not push off with the big toe, using the side of the foot instead. StW 573 is the oldest hominin specimen with an adducted big toe. The specimen StW 355 is the most curved proximal foot phalanx bone of any known hominin, more similar to that of orangutans and siamangs. The arms of StW 573 were about , and her legs . This means the arm was 86.9% the length of the leg. She is the first and only early hominin specimen to definitively show that the arms were almost all long as the legs. Nonetheless, these proportion are more similar to humans than non-human apes, with humans at 64.5–78%, chimps about 100%, gorillas 100–125%, and orangutans 135–150.9%. PalaeobiologyDiet= In 1954, Robinson proposed that A. africanus was a generalist omnivore whereas P. robustus was a specialised herbivore; and in 1981, American palaeoanthropologist Frederick E. Grine suggested that P. robustus specialised on hard foods such as nuts whereas A. africanus on softer foods such as fruits and leaves. Based on carbon isotope analyses, A. africanus had a highly variable diet which included a notable amount of C4 savanna plants such as grasses, seeds, rhizomes, underground storage organs, or perhaps grass-eating invertebrates (such as locusts or termites), grazing mammals, or insectivores or carnivores. Most primates do not eat C4 plants. A. africanus facial anatomy seems to suggest adaptations for producing high stress on the premolars, useful for eating small, hard objects such as seeds and nuts that need to be cracked open by the teeth, or for processing a large quantity of food at one time. However, like for P. robustus, microwear analysis on the cheek teeth indicate small, hard foods were infrequently eaten, probably as fall back foods during leaner times. Still, A. africanus, like chimps, may have required hammerstones to crack open nuts (such as marula nuts), though A. africanus is not associated with any tools. A. africanus conspicuously lacks evidence of dental cavities, whereas P. robustus seems to have had a modern humanlike cavity rate; this could possibly indicate that A. africanus either did not often consume high-sugar cavity-causing foods—such as fruit, honey, and some nuts and seeds—or often did consume gritty foods which decrease cavity incidence rate. However, the 2nd right permanent incisor (STW 270) and right canine (STW 213) from the same individual show lesions consistent with acid erosion, which indicates this individual was regularly biting into acidic foods such as citrus, but tubers could have caused the same damage if some chewing was done by the front teeth. Barium continually deposits onto A. africanus teeth until about 6–9 months of development, and then decreases until about 12 months. Because the Barium was most likely sourced from breast milk, this probably reflects the weaning age. This is comparable to the human weaning age. Following this initial period, Barium deposits stall and then restart cyclically every year for several years. In the first molar specimen StS 28 (from Sterkfontein), this occurred every 6–9 months, and in the lower canine specimen StS 51 every 4–6 months, and this carried on until 4–5 years of development. Lithium and Strontium also deposit cyclically. Cyclical Barium, Lithium, and Strontium bands occur in modern primates—for example, wild orangutans up to 9 years of age—which is caused by seasonal famine when a child has to rely on nursing to sustain themselves and less desirable fallback foods. However, it is unclear if this can be extended to A. africanus. =Society= The group dynamics of australopithecines is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy. A 2011 Strontium isotope study of A. africanus teeth from the dolomite Sterkfontein Valley found that, assuming that especially small teeth represented female specimens and especially large teeth males, females were more likely to leave their place of birth (patrilocal). This is similar to the dispersal patterns of modern-day hominins which have a multi-male kinship-based society, as opposed to the harem society of gorillas and other primates. However, the small canines of males compared to those of females would seem to suggest a much lower degree of male–male aggression than non-human hominins. Males did not seem to have ventured very far from the valley, which could either indicate small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes due to perhaps cave abundance or factors related to vegetation growth. =Pathology= In a sample of 10 A. africanus specimens, 7 exhibited mild to moderate alveolar bone loss resulting from periodontal disease (the wearing away of the bone which supports the teeth due to gum disease). The juvenile specimen STS 24a was diagnosed with an extreme case of periodontal disease on the right side of the mouth which caused pathological bone growth around the affected site and movement of the first two right molars during cyclical periods of bacterial infection and resultant inflammation. Similarly, the individual appears to have preferred to chew using the left side of the jaw. The periodontal disease would have severely hindered chewing, particularly in the last year of life, and the individual potentially may have relied on group members to survive for as long as it did. In 1992, anthropologists Geoffrey Raymond Fisk and Gabriele Macho interpreted the left ankle bone Stw 363 as bearing evidence of a healed calcaneal fracture on the heel bone (which was not preserved), which they believed resulted from a fall from a tree. If correct, then the individual was able to survive for a long time despite losing a great deal of function in the left leg. However, they also noted that similar damage could potentially have also been inflicted by calcite deposition and crystallisation during the fossilisation process. Calcaneal fractures have been recorded in humans, and present quite often in arboreal primates. Palaeoecology Taung child skull noting raptor-inflicted damage to the eye sockets South African australopithecines appear to lived in an area with a wide range of habitats. At Sterkfontein, fossil wood belonging to the liana Dichapetalum cf. mombuttense was recovered. The only living member of this tree genus in South Africa is Dichapetalum cymosum, which grows in dense, humid gallery forests. In modern day, D. mombuttense only grows in the Congolian rainforests, so its presence could potentially mean the area was an extension of this rainforest. The wildlife assemblages indicate a mix of habitats such as bush savanna, open woodland, or grassland. The shrub Anastrabe integerrima was also found, which today only grows on the wetter South African coastline. This could indicate the Cradle of Humankind received more rainfall in the Plio-Pleistocene. In total, the Cradle of Humankind may have featured gallery forests surrounded by grasslands. Taung also appears to have featured a wet, closed environment. Australopithecines and early Homo likely preferred cooler conditions than later Homo, as there are no australopithecine sites that were below in elevation at the time of deposition. This would mean that, like chimps, they often inhabited areas with an average diurnal temperature of , dropping to at night. In 1983, studying P. robustus remains, South African palaeontologist Charles Kimberlin Brain hypothesised that australopithecine bones accumulated in caves due to large carnivore activity, dragging in carcasses. He was unsure if these predators actively sought them out and brought them back to the cave den to eat, or inhabited deeper recesses of caves and ambushed them when they entered. Baboons in this region modern day often shelter in sinkholes especially on cold winter nights, though Brain proposed that australopithecines seasonally migrated out of the Highveld and into the warmer Bushveld, only taking up cave shelters in spring and autumn. The A. africanus fossils from Sterkfontein Member 4 were likely accumulated by big cats, though hunting hyenas and jackals may have also played a role. Scratches, gouges, and puncture marks on the Taung child similar to those inflicted by modern crowned eagles indicate this individual was killed by a bird of prey. Around 2.07 million years ago, just before the arrival of P. robustus and H. erectus, A. africanus became extinct in the Cradle of Humankind. It is possible that South Africa was a refuge for Australopithecus until the beginning of major climatic variability and volatility, and, perhaps, competition with Homo and Paranthropus.

The javelin argument was used to support the Epicurean thesis about the universe. It was also constructed to counter the Aristotelian view that the universe is finite.  Overview  Lucretius introduced the concept of the javelin argument in his discourse of space and how it can be bound. He explained: :For whatever bounds it, that thing must itself be bounded likewise; and to this bounding thing there must be a bound again, and so on for ever and ever throughout all immensity. Suppose, however, for a moment, all existing space to be bounded, and that a man runs forward to the uttermost borders, and stands upon the last verge of things, and then hurls forward a winged javelin,-- suppose you that the dart, when hurled by the vivid force, shall take its way to the point the darter aimed at, or that something will take its stand in the path of its flight, and arrest it? For one or other of these things must happen. There is a dilemma here that you never can escape from.Google Books result: W. H. Mallock, Lucretius. John B. Alden:New York, 1883. p. 86 The javelin argument has two implications. If the hurled javelin flew onwards unhindered, it meant that the man running was not at the edge of the universe because there is something beyond the edge where the weapon flew. On the other hand, if it did not, the man was still not at the edge because there must be an obstruction beyond that stopped the javelin. However, the argument assumes incorrectly that a finite universe must necessarily have a \\"limit\\" or edge. The argument fails in the case that the universe might be shaped like the surface of a hypersphere or torus. (Consider a similar fallacious argument that the Earth's surface must be infinite in area: because otherwise one could go to the Earth's edge and throw a javelin, proving that the Earth's surface continued wherever the javelin hit the ground.)

His red hair and audacity had earned him the title among the Germans of 'Der Rote Fuchs' - the Red Fox. was a British prisoner at Colditz Castle (POW camp Oflag IV-C) during World War II. He was involved in a number of escape attempts and was recognised within the camp for his determination to escape.Reid, pp. 308–309 his life was devoted to escaping, and his determination was as valuable as a hundred ton battering ram matched against the walls of Colditz. Sinclair was the only person to be killed while attempting to escape Colditz. Early life Sinclair was born 26 February 1918 [Winchester College Website - Mike Sinclair DSO]Reid, 308. He was a few years younger than Rupert - about twenty-six. younger son of Colonel Thomas Charles Sinclair, C.B.E. and of Iris Lucy Sinclair, née Lund. Educated at Winchester College, he played for the college cricket XI at Lord's. He went on to study History and Modern Languages at Trinity College, Cambridge. Later, this linguistic ability and knowledge was to prove invaluable. Early military career Commissioned into the 2nd Battalion, The King's Royal Rifle Corps in July 1939,Reid, 208. Late arrivals included Major Ronnie Littledale and Lieutenant Michael Sinclair, both of Winchester and of the 60th Rifles. he was captured by German forces in northern France and sent to Stalag XXI-D (Poznań) POW camp in the north of Poland.Reid, 208. Ronnie Littledale and Michael Sinclair had escaped together from a camp in the north of Poland. Escape from Stalag XXI-D Fort VIII Stalag XXI-D from which Sinclair escaped in a handcart On 28 May 1941, Sinclair escaped from Fort VIII, Stalag XXI-D, along with comrades Gris Davies-Scourfield and fellow Wykehamist, Ronnie Littledale concealed in a modified handcart. They received assistance from Polish citizens and travelled through Łódź, Kaluskia, Lubochnia-Gorki to Tomazow Maz with the intention of reaching Russia. Learning of the German invasion of the USSR. they changed their plans and walked to Warsaw, where they lived in hiding from 25 June to 26 August. Davies-Scourfield remained in Warsaw while Sinclair and Littledale travelled by train to Kraków and onward to Zakopane, alighting at the station before the main city. They walked across the Slovakian border and were driven to Rožňava, where they caught the night train to Budapest. There they stayed for a month before travelling again by train to Yugoslavia through Szeged to Pančevo, then across the River Danube by ferry to Belgrade. On 11 November they took a train to Jagodina and five days later, took the Sofia train to Bela Palanka. From here they crossed the Yugoslav–Bulgarian frontier by horse-drawn cart. While walking to meet another cart they were stopped by a Bulgarian customs official who, on seeing their Yugoslav papers, took them into custody. They were handed over to the Bulgarian police in Pirot and moved from there to Sofia. Following interrogation, on 27 November, they were handed over to the German police. Moved from Sofia to Belgrade they were then moved to Vienna and held in the military prison from 2 December to 17 January 1942. They were then taken by train, escorted by one Feldwebel and a soldier in the direction of Dresden. Seizing an opportunity between Prague and Roudnice, both managed to escape from the moving train through a lavatory window. Unfortunately, Sinclair was spotted and having hurt his leg jumping from the train, was soon recaptured. Littledale avoided capture and eventually headed for Switzerland but was caught in Husinec on 29 May, while trying to avoid the police activity in and around Prague after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich two days earlier. Both men were interviewed by the Gestapo before being sent to Colditz. Arrival at Colditz Castle and escape Sinclair arrived in Colditz, along with Littledale, in July 1942 and almost immediately made an attempt to escape.Reid, 208. During 1942 the number rose further, until by summer there were about 60. He received a court martial charge for an offence allegedly committed in his prior POW camp. He was taken to Leipzig for trial but managed to make a getaway whilst in a lavatory at a Leipzig barracks.Reid, 208. His court martial was in Leipzig, but he managed to elude his guards He was recaptured a few days later in Cologne, during a civilian hunt for RAF pilots believed to have been shot down over the city, during a bombing raid; his clothing, primarily of RAF origin, gave him away.Reid, 209. the colour of most of his clothing was unfortunate because a witch-hunt of RAF parachute survivors was in progress \\"Franz Josef\\" escape In April 1943, Dick Howe, the incumbent British Escape Officer, was approached by Sinclair, who had just been released from a long spell of solitary confinement for a previous escape attempt and his fellow POW, Monty Bissell, with perhaps one of the more audacious escape plans to emerge from within the walls of Colditz.Chancellor, 221. In April 1943, Mike Sinclair and Monty Bissell approached the British Escape Officer, Dick Howe, with a plan more audacious than any impersonation attempted so far Howe had mused over the possibility of switching German guards with British imposters.Reid, 408. \\"I was thinking that, if we could change a sufficient number of sentries...\\" His comments were not lost on Bissell,Reid, 408. Then Dick drifted away and Monty was left alone. That was how the escape attempt started. who quickly noticed the physical similarities between Sinclair and one of the German guard commanders,Reid, 408-409. Mike was of medium build, just about the same height as one of the German guard commanders, who was known in the Castle as Franz JosefChancellor, 223. Mike Sinclair spoke impeccable German, and, like Stabsfeldwebel Rothenburger, he had red hair Stabsfeldwebel (Sergeant Major) Fritz Rothenberger, who was better known to the prisoners and guards as \\"Franz Josef\\" for his strong resemblance to Franz Josef, the former Austrian Emperor.Reid, 413. He was a living impersonation of Fraz Josef, Emperor of AustriaChancellor, 221. Stabsfeldwebel Rothenberger - known to the prisoners and guards as 'Frans Josef' Sinclair in Colditz, seated with a mess, second from rightRothenberger's duties included nightly inspections of the sentries on the eastern terrace of the castle, which overlooked a park area.Chancellor, 221. One of Rothenberger's tasks was to make a nightly inspection of the sentries on the eastern terrace of the castle overlooking the park. This beat was one of the least popular amongst the German guards,Chancellor, 222. it was one of the least popular beats as the narrow pathway abutted the walls of the castle and caused severe discomfort for the sentries who were required to watch the walls.Chancellor, 222. \\"You couldn't look up at the walls for more than five minutes at a time\\" It was from here that Sinclair and Bissell intended to escape. They proposed to Howe that Sinclair, disguised as Rothenberger, along with two other prisoners disguised as German guards, climb through one of the sick bay windows overlooking the secluded terrace on the northern side of the castle and then descend to the sentry path via the steps leading down from the terrace.Reid, 409. \\"Monty has an idea for an escape...\\" Then, he planned to proceed around the sentry path towards the catwalk and gate on the Eastern side of the castle, and alert the sentries on the way to an 'escape attempt' on the other side of the castle and order them to return to the guardroom.Chancellor, 222. instead of waking the sentries up, he would give them a bogus story... Once the guards on the path had been dismissed, he would then march to the gate and replace the two guards on duty with their British counterparts. If successful, the British would have perhaps three and a half minutes,Reid, 414. This interval of time was checked repeatedly as a minimum of three and a half minutes for as many men as possible to descend from the British quarters overlooking the eastern side of the Castle, via sheet ropes. These men would then pass through the gates guarded by the replacement guards in those three and a half minutes, before the real German guards returned to the guard house (with the real Rothenberger) discovered the ruse. The escape attempt hinged on the ability of Sinclair to fool the German guards into believing he was the real Rothenberger. Already a fluent German speaker,Reid, 308. He was, by now, a fluent German speaker. he spent the next month, along with Teddy Barton and Alan Cheetham, studying his habits, mannerisms, gestures and accent.Reid, 414. Teddy Barton, Mike Sinclair and Alan Cheetham studies Franz Josef's gestures, facial expressions, manner of speech, accent and intonation for a month on end. Whenever he entered the courtyard he was besieged by prisoners engaging him in idle conversation whilst observers noted every detail.Reid, 414. Franz Josef was dogged every time he entered the courtyard. To take care of physical appearance, the services of Barton, who had honed his make-up skills in the camp theatre,Reid, 413. Teddy Barton was one of the theatre past-masters. were called upon and with Cheetham's assistance, manufactured no fewer than fourteen Rothenberger moustaches before they were happy with their work.Reid, 414. He and his principle aide, Alan Cheetham, manufactured fourteen Franz Josef moustaches before they were happy with their handiwork. Rex Harrison was given the task of producing three perfect German uniforms,Reid, 413. Rex Harrison ... would have to product three perfect German uniforms. whilst Major W. F. Anderson set to work to produce two imitation German rifles, two bayonets with scabbards, a revolver complete with holster made out of cardboard and boot polish, buttons, badges, medals and belt clasps.Reid, 413. Major W. F. Anderson and Scarlet O'Hara were commissioned ... The escape attempt took place on 19 May 1943 immediately after the 9.00 pm Appell (roll-call).Reid, 416.

Mike ought to go. He's wasting time. The three of them can make it.\\" He became increasingly annoyed with the sentry and soon started yelling at himReid, 419. \\"He's getting annoyed with the sentry.\\" and it was not long before guards arrived from all over the camp, including the real Rothenberger.Reid, 420. A dozen Goons came through the archway ... At their rear ... ran Franz Josef Confusion ensued, with the German guards running around in panic and the NCOs unsure of the allegiance of the men under their command.Reid, 422. They were no longer certain of the allegiance of the men they commanded. Before long, a shot rang out and Sinclair sank to his knees, wounded.Reid, 422. One of the Franz Josef's swayed and sank to his knees. As the confusion began to subside, the prisoners were summoned to the courtyard for an Appell and the wounded Sinclair was left on the ground, unattended, for nearly 10 minutes.Reid, 423. For nearly ten minutes, Mike was left lying on the ground This caused much anger and resentment within the prisoner contingent, with many believing Sinclair had been killed.Reid, 423. In the courtyard feeling among the prisoners was running high. Many thought that Mike had been killed. Finally, at the Appell, Oberst Pravitt, the camp Commandant, announced \\"Lieutenant Sinclair is wounded but out of danger\\".Reid, 423. Oberst Pravitt, the German Commandant of the Camp, hurried into the yard. Howe later lamented his decision to not give Sinclair any specific order to quit if the plan went awry: Final escape Sinclair attempted to copy Lebrun's escape; climbing over the barbed wire and jumping over the wall at the end, on 25 September 1944. He climbed over the fencing, was hit over the head by the butt of a gun by the guard but continued running. The guards fired at him and a bullet hit his elbow, ricocheting off and penetrating his heart, killing him. He was the only prisoner to be killed during an escape attempt at Colditz. The Germans buried Sinclair in Colditz Civil Cemetery with full military honours, his coffin was draped with a Union Flag made by the German guards and he received a seven-gun salute. In 1947 his grave was concentrated to the Berlin 1939–1945 War Cemetery. For his \\"relentless devotion to escaping whilst a POW\\" he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Order after the war, the only lieutenant to be awarded the medal during World War II for an action in captivity.

He played cowboy Cheyenne Bodie in the ABC/Warner Bros. western series Cheyenne from 1955 to 1963. Early life Clint Walker was born Norman Eugene Walker in Hartford, Illinois, on May 30, 1927; the son of Gladys Huldah (née Schwanda) and Paul Arnold Walker.Walker's biography from his official website His mother was Czech. He had a twin sister named Lucy (1927–2000).At age 73, Walker's twin sister, Neoma L. \\"Lucy\\" Westbrook, died on November 11, 2000 at her residence in Hartford, Illinois. Walker left school to work at a factory and on a riverboat, then joined the United States Merchant Marine at the age of 17 in the last months of World War II. After leaving the Merchant Marines, he worked doing odd jobs in Brownwood, Texas, Long Beach, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, where he worked as a doorman at the Sands Hotel. Walker was also employed as a sheet metal worker and a nightclub bouncer. CareerEarly Films= Walker became a client of Henry Willson, who renamed him \\"Jett Norman\\"p.507 Aaker, Everett Television Western Players of the Fifties: A Biographical Encyclopedia of All Regular Cast Members in Western Series, 1949–1959' McFarland, 1997 and cast him to appear in a Bowery Boys film (Jungle Gents) as a Tarzan-type character. In Los Angeles, he was hired by Cecil B. DeMille to appear in The Ten Commandments. A friend in the film industry helped get him a few bit parts that brought him to the attention of Warner Bros., which was developing a western style television series. =Cheyenne= Walker as Cheyenne Bodie in 1956 Walker's good looks and imposing physique (he stood 6 feet, 6 inches tall with a 48-inch chest and a 32-inch waist)Cowboy actor inspires local Western writer , a December 2003 review transcribed from an Idaho State Journal article helped him land an audition where he won the lead role in the TV series Cheyenne. Billed as \\"Clint Walker\\", he was cast as Cheyenne Bodie, a roaming cowboy hero in the post-American Civil War era. His casting was announced in June 1955. Cheyenne originally appeared as part of Warner Bros. Presents rotating with adaptations of Kings Row and Casablanca. Cheyenne turned out to be the breakout hit. While the series regularly capitalized on Walker's rugged frame with frequent bare- chested scenes, it was also well written and acted. It proved hugely popular for eight seasons. Walker's pleasant baritone singing voice was also occasionally utilized on the series and led Warner Brothers to produce an album of Walker doing traditional songs and ballads. Early in the series run, Warners announced they would star Walker in a feature, The Story of Sam Houston. It was not made. In April 1956 Walker said \\"I don't think I'd want any other roles ... Westerns keep me outdoors and active.\\" Warners cast Walker in the lead of a Western feature film, Fort Dobbs (1958), directed by Gordon Douglas. Howard Thompson described the actor as \\"the biggest, finest-looking Western hero ever to sag a horse, with a pair of shoulders rivaling King Kong's\\".\\"Western and 'Lafayette Escadrille' Open\\", The New York Times, April 19, 1958. Box office returns were modest. Warners tried him in another Douglas-directed Western, Yellowstone Kelly (1959), co-starring Edd Byrnes from another Warners TV show, 77 Sunset Strip. It was a minor success. A number of Cheyenne episodes were cut into feature films and released theatrically in some markets and Walker guest starred as Bodie in an episode of Maverick. (He also guest starred on an episode of 77 Sunset Strip.) Warners tried Walker in a third Western feature directed by Douglas, Gold of the Seven Saints (1961), this time co-starring Roger Moore, who was also under contract to Warners. =Post-Cheyenne= Walker on The Lucy Show Walker had a role in Kraft Suspense Theatre (episode \\"Portrait of an Unknown Man\\", alongside Robert Duvall). He had a supporting role in the Rock Hudson–Doris Day comedy, Send Me No Flowers (1964). Frank Sinatra cast him in the leading role in the war drama None but the Brave (1965), the only film Sinatra directed. After doing some guest appearances in The Lucy Show he fought a grizzly bear in Paramount's Western, The Night of the Grizzly (1966). He starred in a family adventure movie shot in India, Maya (1966). Walker had his biggest hit to date when he played the meek convict Samson Posey in the war drama The Dirty Dozen (1967). Walker returned to Westerns with More Dead Than Alive (1969). The New York Times described the actor as \\"a big, fine-looking chap and about as live- looking as any man could be. And there is something winning about his taciturn earnestness as an actor, although real emotion seldom breaks through\\".Howard Thompson, \\"'Dead' Western\\", The New York Times, May 1, 1969 Walker had support roles in two comic Westerns, Sam Whiskey (1969) and The Great Bank Robbery (1969). =1970s= Walker was one of many names in The Phynx (1970) and returned to TV with the leads in some TV movies, Yuma (1971), Hardcase (1972), and The Bounty Man (1972). In May 1971 he was seriously injured in a skiing accident on Mammoth Mountain when one of his ski poles went through his chest but he recovered. Walker supported Telly Savalas in the biopic Pancho Villa (1972) and starred a short-lived series in 1974 called Kodiak, playing an Alaskan patrolman. He starred in the made-for-television cult film Killdozer! The same year as well as Scream of the Wolf (1974). Walker starred in Baker's Hawk (1976) and had support parts in Snowbeast (1977), and The White Buffalo (1977). He starred in the Canadian Deadly Harvest (1977) and had a small role in Centennial and Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women (1979). Literary pursuits Walker met western author Kirby Jonas through James Drury, a mutual friend. Jonas and Walker subsequently spent two years collaborating on a storyline by Walker involving gold and the Yaqui. The partnership led to the publication of the 2003 Western novel Yaqui Gold (). Clint Walker Star on Texas Trail of Fame Honors Walker being pinned with a Sheriff's Badge at Frontier Fiesta at the University of Houston (circa 1950s) Walker has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1505 Vine Street, near its intersection with Sunset Boulevard (approximate coordinates: ). In 2004, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He received the Golden Boot Award in 1997. He has a star on the Texas Trail of Fame at the Fort Worth Stockyards. Personal life and death Walker had three marriages, each of which lasted approximately twenty years. Walker married Verna Garver in 1948. The marriage produced one daughter, Valerie (born 1950) before ending in divorce in 1968. Valerie became one of the first female airline pilots. In 1974, Walker married Giselle Hennessy, who died in 1994. Walker then married Susan Cavallari in 1997. Eventually he took up residence in Grass Valley, California. Walker supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. In May 1971, Walker narrowly escaped death in a skiing accident at Mammoth Mountain, California. In a fall from a ski lift, Walker was pierced through the heart with a ski pole. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. However, a doctor detected faint signs of life and rushed Walker to surgery, where his damaged heart was repaired. Within two months, Walker was working again.Ski Magazine, October 19, 1971, pg. 26St. Petersburg Times, May 26, 1971, pg. 17 Walker has said about the accident that he had a near-death experience. Walker died of congestive heart failure in Grass Valley, California, on May 21, 2018, nine days before his 91st birthday.

He coined the notable slogan Inquilab Zindabad (translation of \\"Long live the revolution!\\") in 1921. Together with Swami Kumaranand, he is regarded as the first person to demand complete independence for India in 1921 at the Ahmedabad Session of the Indian National Congress.  Biography  He was born in 1875 as Syed Fazl-ul- Hasan at Mohan, a town in the Unnao district of United Provinces in British India. Hasrat was his pen name (takhallus) that he used in his Urdu poetry whereas his last name 'Mohani' refers to Mohan, his birthplace. His ancestors migrated from Nishapur, in Iran.Gulam Ali Allana (1988) Muslim political thought through the ages: 1562–1947, Royal Book Company (1988), p. 215, Avril Ann Powell (2013) Muslims and Missionaries in Pre-Mutiny India, Routledge, p. 181, Hasrat Mohani championed the freedom struggle. He also wrote verses expressing deep love for Krishna,C.M. Naim The Maulana Who Loved Krishna Outlook India (magazine), Published 12 January 2012, Retrieved 12 March 2019 and often went to Mathura to celebrate Krishna Janmashtami. He studied at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College which later became Aligarh Muslim University, where some of his colleagues were Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar and Maulana Shaukat Ali. His teachers in poetry were Tasleem Lucknawi and Naseem Dehlvi. To honor him, Aligarh Muslim University has a hostel named after him =Academic= A few of his books are Kulliyat-e-Hasrat Mohani (Collection of Hasrat Mohani's poetry), Sharh-e-Kalam-e-Ghalib (Explanation of Ghalib's poetry), Nukaat-e-Sukhan ( Important aspects of poetry), Mushahidaat-e-Zindaan (Observations in Prison), etc. A very popular ghazal Chupke Chupke Raat Din sung by Ghulam Ali and 'Ghazal King' Jagjit Singh was penned by him. He was also featured in the film Nikaah (1982). The famous slogan of Indian freedom fighters Inquilab Zindabad was coined by Mohani in 1921. =Political= Mohani was a member of the Indian National Congress for many years and also joined the All India Muslim League, serving as its president in 1919. He opposed the partition of India. After the declaration of the Partition Plan on 3 June 1947, Mohani resigned as a member of the All India Muslim League and when the division of the country occurred, he chose to live in independent India. He became a member of the Constituent Assembly of India which drafted the Indian Constitution. He saw hypocrisy towards Muslim minorities in the constitution. So he never signed it. In order to represent the remaining Indian Muslims on different platforms, Hasrat Mohani chose to live in India rather than migrate to Pakistan. He never accepted Government allowances or stayed at official residences. Instead he stayed in mosques and used to go to the Parliament in a shared tonga. He was a religious practicing Muslim and led a simple life. Maulana had gone for Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) several times. He used to travel in third class railroad cars. When asked why he travelled third class, he quipped because there is no fourth class. Struggle for Indian independence B. R. Ambedkar and Mohani (left) at Vallabhbhai Patel's reception Mohani participated in the struggle for Indian Independence (end of British Raj); and was jailed in 1903 for many years by British authorities. At that time political prisoners were treated like common criminals and forced to do manual labor. In 1904, he joined the Indian National Congress Party. He was the first person in Indian History who demanded 'Complete Independence' (Azadi-e-Kaamil) in 1921 as he presided over an annual session of All-India Muslim League. In December 1929, his campaign for 'complete independence' resulted in the shape of Indian National Congress session in Lahore. Mohani opposed the partition of India. After complete independence from the British rule, Maulana Hasrat Mohani wanted a confederal set up on the pattern of Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR). He wanted to see a confederal constitution in India after freedom from the British rule. His proposal had six federations: 1. East Pakistan; 2. West Pakistan; 3. Central India; 4. South-eastern India; 5. South-western India; and 6. Hyderabad Deccan. =Communist movement= He was among the founders of the Communist Party of India at Kanpur in 1925. He was also imprisoned for promoting anti-British ideas, especially for publishing an article against British policies in Egypt, in his magazine 'Urdu-e-Mualla'. Afterwards, unlike some Urdu poets like Josh Malihabadi and many Muslim leaders, he chose to live in India rather than move to Pakistan after independence (1947) to represent left over Indian Muslims on various platforms. In recognition for his efforts, he was made a member of the constituent assembly which drafted the Indian constitution. But unlike other members, he never signed it. Death and legacy Maulana Hasrat Mohani died on 13 May 1951 in Lucknow, India. Hasrat Mohani Memorial Society was founded by Maulana Nusrat Mohani in 1951. In Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, Hasrat Mohani Memorial Library and Hall Trust, Karachi have been established by Hasrat Mohani Memorial Society. Every year, on his death anniversary, a memorial meeting is conducted by this Trust as well as many other organisations in India and Pakistan. Also Hasrat Mohani Colony, at Korangi Town in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan, was named after Maulana Hasrat Mohani. A famous road is named after him in the financial hub of Karachi. There is a Street Named Maulana Hasrat Mohani in Kadar Palace, Mumbra, Dist: Thane, Maharashtra. Maulana Hasrat Mohani Hospital is situated in Chamanganj, Kanpur. There is also a road named Maulana Hasrat Mohani Street in Kanpur. Maulana Hasrat Mohani Gallery is situated at Bithoor Museum. Hasrat Mohani Memorial Girls' Higher Secondary School in Metiabruz, Kolkata, India, is named after him. A hostel in Aligarh Muslim University is also named after him.

It is part of the Macquarie-Castlereagh catchment within the Murray–Darling basin and is an unregulated river, meaning no dams or storage have been built on it to control flows.http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/water- management/basins-and-catchments/castlereagh-catchment . Accessed 20 April 2018 On a map of NSW, the Castlereagh has a distinctive appearance among the north-western rivers for its fish-hook-like shape: from upstream in the north at its confluence with the Macquarie River it extends southwards to a hook- shape, flattened-out at the base, which curves to the right (east and northwards) through to the tip of the hook in the Warrumbungle Mountains at the river's source. The Castlereagh rises 20 km west of Coonabarabran in the heart of the Warrumbungle mountains at an elevation of about 850 metres.\\"Water Sharing Plan for the Castlereagh Unregulated and Alluvial Water Sources - Background Document for amended plan 2016, NSW Department of Primary Industries - Water, published 2016,'The Castlereagh River Valley' p.8 From its commencement upstream in the mountains the river initially flows east through the town of Coonabarabran. It then arcs round south and southwesterly to the village of Ulamambri, then south to Binnaway, and SSW to the small town of Mendooran which lies at the eastern side of the river's hook-shape. From here the Castlereagh flows in a westerly direction at the flattened bottom of the hook and then turns north-westerly towards the town of Gilgandra. From Gilgandra it continues to run northwesterly across the plains through Gulargambone and Coonamble, then continuing across expansive plains, with no urban centres, where elevations are less than 200m, until it joins the Macquarie River at its uppermost reaches beyond the Macquarie Marshes. Its confluence with the Macquarie is about 65 km SW of Walgett. Not far from the Castlereagh/Macquarie confluence the Macquarie itself joins the Barwon River at a place about halfway between Walgett and Brewarrina.https://www.water.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/675458/background- document-castlereagh-river-unregulated-and-alluvial.pdf. Accessed 20 April 2018 Downstream from Gilgandra, the Castlereagh runs through alluvial plains. These are flat landforms with alluvial soil that has been created from sediments being deposited over a long period of time by one or more rivers flowing down from highland regions.World Atlas, 'What is an Alluvial Plain?' https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-an-alluvial-plain.html Accessed 21 April 2018 Groundwater is found in the alluvial sediments on the plains in the lower Castlereagh catchment and is generally associated with the ancient channel of the river.https://www.mdba.gov.au/discover- basin/catchments/macquarie-castlereagh. Accessed 21 April 2018 The Castlereagh has a very sandy bed throughout its course, with especially wide outer banks on the plains. Charles Sturt, after travelling along the Castlereagh in 1828 from Coonamble to its junction with the Macquarie, noted that there was not one pebble or stone to be picked up in its bed, which was dry for the whole length he travelled.see Sturt, Capt Charles, ‘Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia’, Volume 1, pub. Smith, Elder and Co London, at chapter 4, section 'Starving condition of the Natives'. https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/sturt/charles/s93t/ Further upstream, the Castlereagh, Macquarie and Bogan rivers run \\"more or less parallel as they cross the plains, where creeks and streams break away from the main rivers, making connections between the Macquarie and the Bogan, the Macquarie and the Barwon, and the Castlereagh and the Barwon. As the waterways approach the Barwon River the interconnected streams, as well as lagoons and channels, support extensive flood-dependent woodlands and grasslands\\". In this extreme northern section of the catchment the floodplain between the Barwon and Castlereagh Rivers is intersected by Womat and Wanourie Creeks, which carry flows from the Barwon to the Castlereagh River during major floods.https://www.water.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/675458/background- document-castlereagh-river-unregulated-and-alluvial.pdf. Accessed 21 April 2018 Estimates of the length of the course of the Castlereagh River from its commencement to its mouth vary from , 549 km, and 566 km. Over its course it drops over 600 m. River flows The Castlereagh River has a highly variable flow, and often has from very low flow to no flow at all. The sandy riverbed of the Castlereagh is frequently dry in many places. John Oxley's expedition of 1818 came across the Castlereagh near Coonamble running so high and fast that it was six days until water levels dropped sufficiently to allow the expeditionary party to cross. Ten years later Charles Sturt arrived in the same general area during a ravaging drought to find the Castlereagh dry, and continuing completely dry for miles on end downstream to its junction with the Macquarie River with only occasional waterholes to be found nearby. Two claims are often anecdotally made about flows in the Castlereagh: (i) Claim of the fastest flowing inland river in Australia.See for example 'The Sun', 31 July 1936. \\"Coonamble’s Way\\" p.21 (ii) Claim as an underground flowing river.See for example the Coonamble Shire flyer at http://www.coonambleshire.nsw.gov.au/VisitingCoonamble/coonamble.html accessed 24 April 2018 In more recent times, it has also been called an \\"upside down river\\".see for example Coonamble Shire, 'Coonamble Visitors Guide', \\"From the Mountains to the Marshes\\" p. 2, and www.coonamblerodeoandcampdraft.com.au 2014 guide accessed 24 April 2018 =Flow velocity= The gradients of the upper reaches of the Castlereagh River and its tributaries are steep, located in the Warrumbungle Mountains and its foothills. In flood events, velocities can be dangerously high - a speed of 3 metres per second has been recorded at Coonabarabran.Warrumbungle Shire, Local Flood Plan, \\"Characteristics of Flooding\\", May 2007 p A-4 Additionally, the catchment area of the upper Castlereagh is criss-crossed with many streams and creeks flowing off the foothills, whose floodwater rushes with high velocity into the main river. Flow times downstream can vary greatly depending on the severity of flood. Flood peaks travelling between Coonabarabran and Gilgandra have been recorded taking as little as nine hours to travel the distance, and up to 47 hours. Usually in peak floods, the greater the water volume, the faster the travel times of the peak. However, the flattening of the terrain upstream of Coonamble results in decreased flow velocity (but means a greater area for the flow is needed to avoid flooding).Jacobs Group Pty Ltd, for Coonamble Shire Council,‘Data Collection, Review and Flood Study for West Coonamble, Gulargambone and Quambone - West Coonamble Flood Study Report, p.7. file:///Users/Jo/Downloads/Draft+West+Coonamble+Flood+Study+-+website+version%20(1).pdf Accessed 24 April 2018 =Underground flow= It is not correct that the Castlereagh River is an underground river (subterranean river) or an 'upside down' river.Nikki Harrington and Peter Cook ’Groundwater in Australia’, published by The National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training. http://www.groundwater.com.au/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDMvMjUvMDFfNTFfMTNfMTMzX0dyb3VuZHdhdGVyX2luX0F1c3RyYWxpYV9GSU5BTF9mb3Jfd2ViLnBkZiJdXQ/Groundwater%20in%20Australia_FINAL%20for%20web.pdf accessed 21 April 2018, p2-3 However, water that once was in the river bed on the surface does flow through the extensive sands under the riverbed. This water is therefore part of the underground soil, and is not separate from it as a truly underground river is separate from the soil. The fact of water existing under the riverbed was known by Europeans at least in the early part of the last quarter of the 1800s, if not before, as evidenced in statements given to the Water Conservation Commission Inquiry at Dubbo in 1885.SMH 30 May 1885 p 11. See statements of Mr RG Dulhunty and Mr G. Cass The below-ground sedimentary deposits in the area of the Great Artesian Basin are particularly good water stores (aquifers), and the highly permeable sediments below NSW’s western flowing rivers create excellent aquifers.(http://www.bom.gov.au/water/regulations/fundingProgram/document/swimps/nsw/nsw_swimp_supplementary_report_2010.pdf. NSW Office of Water, June 2010, at p.78) Accessed 21 April 2018 A theory of an extensive sub-artesian store of water was proposed by Mr James Samuels and published in the \\"Empire\\" of 27 and 28 August 1868, including a view that dry inland rivers would have water under the bed. Some pastoralists in western NSW paid attention and began to sink wells, often near rivers.'Empire' 14 January 1870 This may have contributed to the idea of an underground flowing river in the largely empty above-ground Castlereagh. The river contains wide alluvial sandbeds. Because the pore space between sand particles is large, water can easily move through the soil layer (i.e. the sand layer). This means the river's sandbeds can be described as highly permeable. (Permeability is measured by calculating the discharge rate at which water will be transported through the pore spaces of the material; the discharge rate being controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated material). The Castlereagh River and the ground water of the Great Artesian Basin are highly connected. The water is not flowing as a separate and distinguishable underground river flow, but is moving initially through the permeable alluvial sandbeds and then through paleochannels to deeper groundwater aquifers. The Castlereagh’s alluvial sandbeds make up what is called the \\"hyperheic zone\\". This is the region of saturated sediment below, or adjacent to, a river where surface water and groundwater are actively mixing and exchanged. The movement of the groundwater in the Castlereagh through its alluvial sands is said to be a hyporheic process. In the Castlereagh, the further transit of surface water to the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin is then enabled through the ancient paleochannels underlying the Castlereagh, and this water movement is a large- scale hyporheic process. (Hutchinson and Webster 1998). The Great Artesian Basin The Castlereagh sits over the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) and within a re-charge area for the waters of the GAB (where the GAB waters are replenished from above ground). Areas of re-charge are divided into zones, called ‘sources’ and the Castlereagh River is within the Southern Recharge Groundwater Source. This source, together with the Eastern Recharge Groundwater Source, is characterised by better quality groundwater than other zones. Tributaries The Castlereagh River is joined by dozens of minor tributaries in its journey towards the very upper Macquarie. The Major Rivers Database of NSW lists seventy streams, (including effluent streams that receive water from the river) of the Castlereagh.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/MajorRivers.htm#cwcma extracted 20 April 2018 On the upper reaches the most important tributaries, originating in the mountains or slopes, and joining the river before Ulamambri are: Shawn, Gundi, Billy Kings, Baby and Terrawinda Creeks. Above Binnaway are Jack Halls, Belar, Spring, Greenbah and Ulinda creeks, and between Binnaway and Mendooran are Chinamans, Greyholme, Piambra and Dinnykymine Creeks. The section between Mendooran and Gilgandra has many creeks and waterways, and some of the tributaries are, from upper to lower section: Sand Creek and Borambil Creek, Wallumburawang Creek, Rocky Creek, Coondoomea Creek, Gidgenboyne Creek, Boyben Creek, Ryans Creek, Apple Tree Creek, Denmire Creek, Gum Creek, Sallabalah Creek, Rocky Creek; then Quandong Creek, Back Creek and Deep Creek near the area of Breelong, and Jumpers Creek just south of Gilgandra. Between Gilgandra and Coonamble the tributaries are Ulamogo Creek joining the Castlereagh partway between Gilgandra and Curban, Terrabile Creek just near Curban, Gulargambone Creek at Gulargambone, Wilber Creek between Gulargambone and Combara, and Baronne CreekGoogle Maps At Coonamble, are Balagula Creek, Eurimie Creek and Warrena Creek. Downstream of Coonamble are Coolibah Creek, and Teridgerie Creek which rises in the Warrumbungles. The main tributaries on this section of river are Ulinda, Butheroo and Merrygoen creeks, as well as Kennedy's Creek and Duck Holes Creek further upstream near Wingadee. Aboriginal life on the Castlereagh According to the colonial surveyor Thomas Mitchell in 1846, the original inhabitants called the river the Barr.Mitchell, Thomas, Sir \\"Journal of an expedition into the interior of tropical Australia, in search of a route from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria\\", Chapter 1 at entry date 22nd Feb 1846, publisher Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1848, http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00034.html Accessed 10 March 2019 The British imposed the name \\"Castlereagh\\" (through explorer Oxley) only two hundred years ago in 1818. River systems are fundamentally important to Aboriginal Australian people. As Professor Marcia Langton has described, the Aboriginal people's holistic view of the world creates connection to waterscapes as spiritual, social and jural spaces just as much as physical domains - just like the same principles that connect people to landscape. Established laws that come from the sacred ancestral past \\"allocate rights and interests among particular people, to water sources\\". These are \\"rights and responsibilities, according to religious principles.\\" Langton, M ., \\"Freshwater\\" in ATSIC Briefing Papers, February 2002, pp. 43-44. The Castlereagh River passes through hundreds of miles of country and several different nations of the Aboriginal people. Therefore, the rights regarding the Castlereagh may have been complex. The source area of the river, from the Warrumbungles through to its down slopes area, encompassed the western edge of Kamilaroi /Gamilaraay country. The river's upper reaches around Mendooran and Gilgandra flow through the northern end of Wiradjuri country. Once past Gilgandra, the river flows into the area of the Wailwan people, across the plains and through to its lower reaches.The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Map of Indigenous Australia Along the Castlereagh to around Coonamble, there was clearly overlap of these three groupings - Kamilaroi, Wiradjuri and Wailwan. Europeans observed that, at Gilgandra near the long waterhole that existed on the Castlereagh, \\"the 'Coonabarabran' tribe (European-given name) of the Gamilaraay people camped on the eastern side of the river, and the Mole tribe of the Wiradjuri on the western side\\". Evidence of Aboriginal culture was to be found all along the Castlereagh. Some caves in the Warrumbungle Ranges contain hand stencils, marked rocks and engravings. Rocks at Willow Vale in the Castlereagh River near the centre of Coonabarabran have grinding grooves on them.Christison, Ray (2018) Ukerbarly Aboriginal Area Aboriginal History and Occupation Report, Published 2018 by Office of Environment & Heritage National Parks and Wildlife Service, p.6, https://www.academia.edu/36702201/Ukerbarley_Aboriginal_Area_Aboriginal_History_and_Occupation_Report = Written record of Aboriginal people = The first European record of Aboriginal people along the Castlereagh came through the John Oxley exploration party of 1818. Waiting for waters in the Castlereagh near present- day Coonamble to recede, Oxley wrote on 27 July 1818 that \\"Natives appear to be numerous; their guniahs (or bark-huts) are in every direction, and by their fire-places several muscle-shells of the same kind as those found on the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers were seen. Game (kangaroos and emus), frequenting the dry banks of the river, were procured in abundance.\\" Oxley, John \\"Journal of An Expedition in Australia.

Accessed 21 April 2018 After finally crossing the river on 3 August and heading easterly towards the Warrumbungle mountains, Oxley wrote the next day: \\"The natives appear pretty numerous: one was very daring, maintaining his ground at a distance armed with a formidable jagged spear and club, which he kept beating against each other, making the most singular gestures and noises that can be imagined: he followed us upwards of a mile, when he left us, joining several companions to the right of us. Emus and kangaroos abound, and there is a great diversity of birds, some of which have the most delightful notes, particularly the thrush.\\"Oxley, John \\"Journal of An Expedition in Australia. Pt II,\\" p.256, published by John Murray, London 1820. http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00037.html Accessed 21 April 2018 Charles Sturt was leading a European exploring party in 1828 when he travelled along the Castlereagh from a point just near Coonamble all the way downstream to its junction with the Macquarie River, and thence to the Darling River. His record of his journey refers to several friendly encounters with different Aboriginal groups who gave his party assistance on these lower reaches. He found that they were generally in severe want because of drought, and considered that they were perishing from famine.(see Sturt, Capt Charles, ‘Two expeditions into the interior of Southern Australia’, Volume 1, See chapter 4 \\"Starving Condition of the Natives\\" pub. Smith, Elder and CO London , at page https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/sturt/charles/s93t/ The exploratory journey of Oxley brought the area of the Castlereagh to the attention of pastoralists. The rich soils along the upper Castlereagh from Mendooran to Coonamble appealed to pastoralists for cattle raising and from the early 1830's Aboriginal people encountered Europeans moving into their country. Europeans were clearly present as early as 1832 at least (see \\"European history\\" below). So commenced a struggle for Aboriginal people to access resources as they once had, and to survive in their traditional way. = European impact on Aboriginal life = In a very short period — of possibly not more than a dozen years — the Aboriginal way of life on the Castlereagh was heavily curtailed. Written evidence in 1841 from pastoralist James Walker showed this, in his response to a circular from the Commissioner of Crown Lands enquiring about pastoralists' interactions with Aborigines. Walker lived at Wallerawang, near Lithgow, but held many pastoral licences over vast stations in the Castlereagh River area from Mendooran (where 'Pampoo' was located) to Coonamble. His response included a single, but telling, comment on the effect of European occupation on Aborigines: \\" ... since stock was first taken out there [i.e. to the Castlereagh] we have abridged all their natural sources of existence.\\"Sydney Free Press, Saturday 16 October 1841, p. 4, Cols 1-2. Even prior to the 1840s some Aboriginal people were working for the pastoralists along the Castlereagh. In his written 1841 response, James Walker also reported that there were usually four or five Aborigines employed on his breeding herd station on the Castlereagh, and that \\"they milk the cows, bring them home in the evening &c; and generally remain on the spot, performing many services which it would be almost impossible now to get white people to do.\\" He also said that those employed on his stations perform valuable services \\"looking up stray cattle, and breaking in heifers to milk &c; for which they received milk, flour and meat and occasionally tobacco, tea and sugar, they get all the food they require while they remain\\". James Walker claimed that there were good relations with the Aboriginal people of the Castlereagh River: \\"... they like uncontrolled liberty and freedom, amongst themselves they appear to have few restraints, they are acute, intelligent and shrewd, and well disposed\\". Walker appears to take a benign approach to the Castlereagh Aboriginals, possibly because they caused him no problems as a pastoralist. But despite acknowledging that Europeans had “abridged all [Aborigines’] natural sources of existence”, Walker expressed the convenient belief that \\"they appear satisfied to receive our food in exchange for services occasionally rendered us.\\" This showed a spectacular lack of concern about the true effects of alienating Aborigines from their land. The Land Commissioner did not seek to interview the Aborigines themselves about what this really meant for them. More early evidence of the Aborigines mixing and/or working with European shepherds and labourers at the Castlereagh came in 1840 from a ticket-of-leave man named William Jones who was then an umbrella maker in Sussex St, Sydney. Jones had agreed to be interpreter in the trial of a Wiradjuri man from the Lachlan River who was not charged under his own name but under the European nickname of \\"Neville's Billy\\". William Jones deposed that the language of the prisoner \\"was the same as that spoken on the banks of the Castlereagh River about three hundred miles from Sydney where he, Jones, had been for about eight years, and where he had learned the language.\\"The Sydney Herald, Thursday 5 November 1840, 'Law intelligence' page 2, column 4. In July 1848, surveyor George Boyle White was tracing the course of the Castlereagh. He noted in his diary that new young cypress trees were growing thickly in an area around Rouse's station ('Breelong') and before he'd got to Merritt's ('Eringanerin') and commented that if there wasn't a fire through there it would become a thick scrub in 20 years. It is possible White was observing the environmental effects of the Aborigines no longer being able to carry out periodic burning of the land as they once always had, so that even by 1848 the landscape was changing. He also recorded at another time that he had not seen any Aborigines along the way, although he did encounter some near Curban and at the Warrumbungle Mountains. The incursion of European men to the Castlereagh resulted in many of them having relationships with Aboriginal women, whether welcomed or otherwise. This lead further to breakdown of Aboriginal traditional life and social cohesion, and often resulted in children for whom the European father might or might not have taken responsibility. The squatter John Jude was one such example. An ex-convict with a family in England, he had gone in the mid 1830s to the area of Armatree near the Castlereagh. In 1841 a local Aboriginal woman bore his daughter, named Eliza Jude, who was murdered in 1859 aged 18.SMH, Sat 16 April 1859, p.5 Aboriginal people continued working for the pastoralists along the Castlereagh through into the 1850s and 1860s, and this was shown with occasional references in the press. See for example \\"Jackey, a native lad of about seventeen\\" who was reported in 1852 to have \\"for years been in the service of Mr Fitzsimmons of 'Gora', Castlereagh River.\\" 'Gora' station was at the foot of the Warrumbuungles, near Bugaldie.Freeman's Journal 1 January 1852 p. 11. Increasing pressure on the resources the Aboriginal people needed for their way of life made them more dependent on Europeans and exposed them to European vices. At the beginning of 1853 when a station worker was murdered by his wife near Curban at the Castlereagh, the hutkeepers and shepherds present had been drinking heavily, supplied by a \\"sly grog\\" seller but also present at a fireplace with the deceased were \\"two black gins lying at his feet and some blackfellows lying beside him\\".The Maitland Mercury, Saturday 22 January 1853, p.4 Aboriginal people were camping along the river at the start of 1874 when the great flood came. At Gilgandra, an aboriginal woman and her young son were assisted by innkeeper Mrs Hannah Morris to flee their camp at the river bank as the water rose around them.'The Castlereagh', Friday 29 June 1906 \\"The Castlereagh Flood\\" p.1, col 7 Eventually, the people camped more permanently at Gilgandra at a place along the river near the race course. At Coonabarabran in 1894 Mary Jane Cain lobbied to have her ownership of her small 400-acre selection, called \\"Burra Bee Dee\\", recognised as a place for her people, and others freely moved there.Christison, Ray 'Thematic History of Coonabarabran Shire', 2006, p.11 At Gulargambone, the banks of the river became a semi- permanent camping place for Aboriginal people, but by 1892 it was gazetted as an Aboriginal Reserve under the Aborigines Protection Board.Christison, Ray (2009) Thematic History of Coonamble Shire, p.15 Despite European occupation, the Aboriginal people of the Castlereagh did manage to keep some of their traditional practices and beliefs alive to the end of the C19th. R.H. Matthews, a government surveyor who worked for twenty years in north-west NSW and became a documenter of Aboriginal life and culture, recorded that \\"in 1893 there was a great gathering of the local Aboriginal people of the Castlereagh with the people of the Macquarie, the Bogan and the Barwon Rivers for a great initiation ceremony\\".  European history First contacts= The first non-Aboriginal person to encounter the Castlereagh River was George Evans travelling in 1818 with the exploration party of Surveyor-General John Oxley. George Evans was Oxley's assistant for the tour of exploration. The group had departed from Bathurst in May 1818, sent by Governor Macquarie to explore the Macquarie River. This expedition would follow the Macquarie River to a point where it was unable to keep tracking it any further, and so would turn east away from the Macquarie, finally ending up on the coast at Port Macquarie.E.W. Dunlop, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol 2 1967, 'Oxley, John Joseph'. Accessed 20 April 2018 In early July, the party returned from the Macquarie Marshes to Mt Harris, 48 km (30 miles) N-NW of present-day Warren. Seemingly unable to further follow the course of the Macquarie, Oxley had to change his plans. He decided to send Evans ahead, with a small party, to scout a north- easterly route across the plains, and report back. Beginning on 8 July 1818, Evans would end up traversing a large loop, north-easterly then south- easterly, then westerly and back to his starting point. In the north-easterly direction, he first crossed the Castlereagh River around Combara, between Gulargambone and Coonamble.Christison, Ray, Thematic History of Gilgandra Shire, \\"3.6 Historical Exploration of NSW\\" published 2009, p.26 The party then continued on a shallower east-north-easterly direction until reaching the foothills of the Warrumbungle Mountains. From here, Evans turned south- westerly to head back to Oxley's encampment at Mt. Harris, travelling across ‘an open plain, over which was rather better travelling than we had latterly experienced’. This route brought his party back to the Castlereagh River at a point south of his first crossing, in an area between the future villages of Armatree and Curban (10 miles apart). As he approached the Castlereagh River he described the country as ‘low and wet’, with the journey being ‘dreadfully bad and marshy’. The country he was crossing over is today considered rich pasture and farming land, covering the areas known as Tonderbrine, the western side of Tooraweenah, the Yarrandale area and Hillside. The scouting party got back to Oxley’s encampment at Mt. Harris on 18 July 1818. On the same day, Oxley named the river in honour of the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, who had been in that role since 1812. The whole group then departed the following day for the river that George Evans had crossed, heading in the same north-easterly direction that Evans had taken. On 27 July 1818 they reached the Castlereagh, but the land they traversed to get there was flooded, whereas it had not been flooded two weeks earlier on Evans's scouting trip. The Castlereagh itself was running high, and they were not able to cross it for another six days. Finally, on 2 August the river level had dropped sufficiently for the whole party to cross. The explorers continued to follow the south-easterly direction from their crossing Evans had taken two weeks before, to reach the Warrumbungles. However, now the party continued easterly through the Goorianawa Gap and eventually reached the coast. =Early pastoralist runs= From the 1830s, pastoralists began squatting on the Castlereagh, commonly moving north-westerly from the Mudgee area moving cattle onto land along the river, cared for by employed men who were often assigned convicts or ex-convicts. The area was at that time outside the official nineteen counties limits of settlement. This meant that pastoralists sending their stock westwards were technically squatting illegally, taking the land for free. In these early days it was mostly the established pastoralists who had access to land information through their friends and contacts in the highest government levels, and who had sufficient capital to own stock already, or buy more, and who were able to send animals and men up-country with supplies for long periods. By 1836, the government had realised that keeping settlement within specified areas (thereby limiting its own obligations) was a lost cause. It therefore established a system of pastoral licences requiring the payment of a licence fee and capping the size of individual pastoral 'runs' at 16,000 acres. Existing squatters overcame the size limitation by dividing their stations into different areas of 16,000 acres each. Europeans were occupying the Castlereagh at least by early 1832. That year, Robert Lowe of Mudgee sent cattle to an area between Gilgandra and Curban on a run he named as \\"Yalcogrin\\", also fed by Ulomogo Creek, a tributary of the Castlereagh.SMH, 14 September 1854, \\"Bathurst Assizes, Lowe Vs Bennett\\", p3. Col 1 In 1840, convict William Jones gave testimony in court that he had been on the Castlereagh River for eight years and learnt the language of the local people (Wiradjuri); if this was not an exaggeration then he had gone there in 1831 or 1832. In 1834, Andrew Brown explored the area near the Warrumbungles for his employer James Walker of Wallerawang, with the assistance of local Aboriginal people, and established several cattle runs, having already established \\"Cuigan\\" up from Mundooran at least in 1836. In 1837 Brown applied for simply an area in northern district of Bligh at Big River. In 1837 Robert Bennett applied for \\"Brumbel' or 'Briamble\\" on 'Big River' and in about 1839, he occupied \\"Kirban\\" station (adjoining Robert Lowe's 'Yalcogrin') which became the present-day Curban area. In 1836, ex- convict John Jude took up \\"Carlingangong\\" or \\"Carlingoinggoing\\" with John Hall, and then applied for 'Armatree' in 1839. There was a flurry of licence applications in 1836 when squatting was legalised and individual runs were set at a maximum of 16,000 acres with the requirement that licence fees be paid. This indicates that at least some of the applicants were already operating in the region: from the area of Mendooran downstream, Richard Rouse applied for \\"Mundooran\\", and for Breelong, Thomas Perrie for Eringanerin (later held in 1848 by John Meritt), and James Bennett at \\"Bearbong\\" as well as Curban, Robert Lowe already had Yalcogrin, and applied for Carlganda and James Lowe in 1839 for \\"Warree\\" further down past Armatree, where Andrew Brown had yet another run \\"Illamurgalia\\". Gibson and Patterson established 'Canamble' run for James Walker's ownership in 1840. Cox Brothers and WC Wentworth also took up licences. =Ordinary life= The overseers or managers on the runs lived very frugally in simple huts. Settlements developed around river crossings, with an inn often established as a staging post for horses, and possibly a store. Post offices, often unofficial would be established, and became the point from which mail coaches left. Mails were to run once a week from Mudgee to Mendooran on the Castlereagh as from 1 January 1852.See advertisement for tenders in Government Gazette, 29 August 1851,'Conveyance of Mails' p.1411 Mendooran was the oldest village on the Castlereagh, but did not officially become a gazetted town until 1859. It became an important centre, with Coonamble developing as the other large centre, and Curban an early village central to the locals while Gilgandra had not developed greatly before its bridge was built in 1878. =Mapping the Castlereagh= In 1848 a well regarded Surveyor, George Boyle White, 'traced' or mapped a large section of the Castlereagh from Binnaway to about Gulargambone. White had previously been employed by the government as a surveyor for twelve years, and had accompanied Surveyor-General Mitchell on an interior surveying expedition. White had a particular interest in surveying rivers and in 1847 Mitchell gave him a general remit to go over the mountains and \\"start the feature survey of that part of the colony\\", in order to \\"traverse the water courses and ranges that they may be charted.\\"Dalton, McCarthy and Tracey, \\"George Boyle White: Surveyor, Colonial Citizen, Diarist, Vol 1\\" pub Princes Hill, Vic, 2014, p.20 The first river he started on was the Castlereagh. White reached his starting point by heading west from his home near Singleton via Cassilis and then NW up the Weetalibah Creek (now named Binnia Creek) till he reached the confluence of that creek with the river (noting that Henry Bailey's run of \\"Miangulliah\\" was opposite this point).Dalton, McCarthy and Tracey, \\"George Boyle White: Surveyor, Colonial Citizen, Diarist, Vol 2\\" pub Princes Hill, Vic, 2014, He started surveying about five miles upstream from this confluence, on 19 June 1848, walking all the way along the Castlereagh. He had with him a small supporting party of men (carrying equipment, measuring with chains, setting up tents, preparing meals) and his teenage son, Henry. White marked and numbered trees each mile along the way. As he proceeded downstream, he noted the pastoral stations he came to, recording first that of Andrew Brown,(Caigan was on the Castlereagh near Binnaway, and Biamble adjacent to it nearer Mendooran) who supplied him with meat for the expedition, and then James Walker's old \\"Pampoo\\", followed by \\"Mrs Hassall's Banduleah\\" (actually 'Bundalla', on the northern side of the river). Floods When John Oxley, Surveyor-General of NSW, got to the Castlereagh River, just near Coonamble, with his exploring party on 27 July 1818, it was running a banker on its inside banks. He wrote: \\"The river during the night had risen upwards of eight feet; and still continued rising with surprising rapidity, running at the rate of from five to six miles per hour, bringing down with it great quantities of driftwood and other wreck. The islands were all deeply covered, and the whole scene was peculiarly grand and interesting.\\" Oxley's description could be applied to most of the many floods in the river over the following 200 years. Floods in the Castlereagh are common. Rain in the Warrumbungles raises the water level in the river bed, and tributary streams sourced in the hills and slopes of the upper catchment pour more water downstream, with a fast flow created due to the steepness of the ranges. The townships of Binnaway, Mendooran and Gilgandra are inundated only in more severe flood events. Lower parts of Coonamble township have been inundated from time to time even in lesser floods. Flood levee banks have been erected on the upstream side of the town. Since 1870, (when there was an inundating flood at Coonamble), Coonabrabran township has been little affected by flooding. The worst floods since European occupation – having the greatest impact on human settlement and economic activity – were in 1874, and 1955. In 1910 heavy floods caused flooding in Mendooran township and in July 1920, houses in low areas along the Castlereagh in Gilgandra township lying north and south of the commercial main strip were badly flooded, but the main street avoided inundation with the river peaking one foot below the height of the town's bridge.Armidale Chronicle, 10 July 1920 p.6 Townspeople in older areas were required by police to evacuate their homes for higher ground but they, too, avoided being flooded.Freemans Journal, 22 July 1920, p.31. Recently, in January 2010, major flooding along the river inundated more than 400 rural properties. Fodder drops were needed and some livestock had to be moved. =1874 flood= A devastating flood in January 1874 killed thousands of head of livestock, and damaged many buildings in Binnaway, Mendooran, Gilgandra and Coonamble. There had been incessant rain in the area of the Upper Castlereagh for three weeks (most of January) leading up to the day the river broke its banks. Over the same few days severe floods also occurred on other river systems: flooding on the Talbragar River at Dubbo was the worst experienced to that time,Maitland Mercury, Thursday 5 February 1874, p.4 the town of Singleton was completely flooded, Maitland was flooded, as was Cassilis.'Maitland Mercury' 3 February 1874 p.3 On Saturday, 24 January, the Castlereagh River commenced rising rapidly, with rain falling heavily all day. During Sunday, 25 January the river continued rising and at Gilgandra on Monday 26th at 5 p.m. it had attained its full height.Australian Town & Country Journal, February 1874 p.22 It was reported from Binnaway that the Castlereagh rose 28 feet in seven hours from 5am till twelve, and a great many sheep were lost in the area. At Mendooran, the townspeople took refuge in the loft of the stables at the Royal Hotel. The flood destroyed many of Binnaway's buildings.Gilgandra Weekly, 18 October 1951, p.2 At Coonamble, houses, stores, hotels and the public school were flooded. There was a \\"terrific current\\" in the flood waters and \\"it rushes by with a noise resembling the surging of the sea at a distance.\\"'Sydney Morning Herald', Thursday 5 February 1874, \\"The Floods in the West\\" p.7 People considered in any danger were rescued by boat or horseback.Maitland Mercury, Saturday 7 February 1874, p.5 On the day of the flood, many settlers from the Coonamble area were in the town for land Appraisement Court hearings and the flood meant many of them could not leave for up to a week.'The Castlereagh', 15 June 1906, p.2 At Gilgandra the flood broke the banks in the middle of the night and it was reported that, while it was \\"hard to tell the immense amount of damage done on the whole river, but what has occurred here is sufficiently disastrous\\". The inn owned and run by Mrs Hannah Morris had existed many years but had been newly re-built six months prior. It was completely washed away.'The Castlereagh', 29 June 1906, p.2 All those at the inn got out as the waters were rising in the building, heading some distance to the police paddock located on a rise to the north of the village. The Johnstone family, newly arrived one week, were camped in their tents to take up the 'Castlereagh' run located on flats on the western side of the river immediately to the north of the small village of Gilgandra. They lost almost all their 800 sheep, most of their cattle and all their belongings, only saving themselves by climbing up a large native apple tree and tying their young children to its branches with ropes so they wouldn't fall in. Thirty years later Mrs Johnstone recalled the dreadful din of the water and the huge number of dead animals, parts of buildings, and fencing being carried downstream on the swirling floodwaters.'The Castlereagh', 6 July 1906, p.1 At Ulomogo (then a very small village located between Gilgandra and Gulargambone) Mrs Goodal and her family, of the Ulomogo hotel, narrowly escaped but her manager, (surname said to be Newland) was drowned while returning to the hotel to collect items. A poem about the flood on the Castlereagh was penned by a local person, (name of author not found). The poem was known and recited by locals for decades, and sometimes it was sung, as reported across different decades after the flood:'The Castlereagh', 17 Sept 1906, p.2, column6; Freemans Journal, 22 July 1920, p.31 =1955 flood= The 1955 flood, in February, was the most severe in European history. This flood was due to extreme cyclonic weather conditions in northern Australia.

Background Durant was born Donald Allison Durae in Long Beach, California. His father was killed in a truck accident near Bakersfield two months before Durant's birth; his mother remarried three times before she died of lung cancer at the age of only forty- six in 1959. Durant himself was seriously injured a few weeks before his eleventh birthday, when his bicycle chain broke, and he careened into the path of a cement truck. He lay in a coma for three days, his right arm fractured, his right femur and hip so badly damaged that doctors nearly amputated the leg before his family scraped up enough money for a specialist. Young Durant was bedridden for more than a year. One of Durant's stepfathers owned a cattle ranch near Elko in northeastern Nevada. Durant spent a summer there and learned to shoot and ride before he returned to California. In junior high school, he was a deejay for a local radio station. In high school, he played on the football team, having worn special plates because of his previous injuries. He enlisted in the United States Navy. At one point, he served in the United States Army as well because of a mixup in paperwork. Toward the end of his commitment, he entertained veterans at Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco. Singer and actor Durant then began touring the American West as a singer/actor. He opened at many prestigious nightclubs, such as The Sands and the Sahara in Las Vegas. He garnered a small role in the 1955 Van Heflin film Battle Cry. To supplement his income, Durant taught actors how to ride horses and shoot guns, and worked at RCA as a technician. He helped to build the first kinescopic recorder and stereophonic sound recorder for Warner Brothers. In 1954, he signed with CBS to take small roles as the singer or young lover in a variety of legendary series, including The Jack Benny Show. He sang Groucho Marx's popular \\"It's delightful, it's Delovely, it's DeSoto\\" advertising jingle for the former DeSoto automobiles. In 1955, Durant met big band leader Ray Anthony and began filming various television advertisements. One for Papermate pens featured his future wife, the former Trudy Wroe, but he did not meet her at the time because his voice was dubbed into the commercial to replace her co-star. In 1956, Durant starred and did his own stunts in Roger Corman's She-Gods of Shark Reef, which became a cult classic. Continuing to tour, he sang on Anthony's ABC variety series and recorded an album. He also appeared in an episode of Sergeant Preston of the Yukon the same year as Jack Elders, son of Tom Elders played by George Selk titled \\"The Limping King\\" and another episode titled \\"Phantom of Phoenixville\\" as Jack Flynn. Durant obtained more guest-starring roles, having appeared as Ronnie Mann in the 1957 episode \\"Ride 'Til You Die\\", about a love triangle at a dude ranch which explodes into murder, in Rod Cameron's syndicated series State Trooper. He appeared on another syndicated series, Rescue 8, starring Jim Davis and Lang Jeffries, and in the first episode of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series Maverick to feature Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, the brother of Bret Maverick (James Garner). Durant had auditioned for the role of Bart but was instead cast as a singing bad guy in the episode. For that part, he learned to play the guitar the weekend before filming. In 1957, celebrity journalist Walter Winchell reported that Durant was courting Carole Mathews, an actress twelve years his senior, who in 1958 joined the cast of the NBC western series, The Californians. About this time, Durant finally met Trudy while they were en route to film an advertisement for the Ford Motor Company. She spent most of the trip gushing over Elvis Presley. Durant told her that he had been to a few Presley parties, and the two began dating. They wed on February 28, 1959, and were together until his death. On March 1, 1959, the day after Durant's marriage, he appeared on CBS in the role of Pat Sharkey in the episode \\"Body of the Crime\\" of the drama series, Richard Diamond, Private Detective, starring David Janssen. Durant also appeared as the villain in a first season episode of Wanted: Dead or Alive. In 1958, Durant shot an unsuccessful pilot which caught the attention of actor/director/producer Dick Powell. As the host of Zane Grey Theater, Powell asked one of his writers, young Aaron Spelling, to create a series for Durant. Spelling was then in his first assignment as a creator and producer. In this heyday of the television Western, CBS quickly snapped up the pilot. Durant wrote and sang the theme and did his own stunts. Hence, Johnny Ringo, set in the Arizona Territory, debuted in the fall of 1959 in the Thursday 8:30 Eastern time slot. Costar Mark Goddard played the deputy named Cully, and Karen Sharpe was cast as Laura Thomas, Ringo's girlfriend and the daughter of Case Thomas, another deputy and a storekeeper played by Terence De Marney. Johnny Ringo's main competition came from Walter Brennan's The Real McCoys on ABC, against which Ringo achieved decent ratings. Sometimes it was in the \\"Top 20\\". Many famous actors guest-starred on Johnny Ringo. The Johnny Ringo Playset became the most sought-after television western toy. Surprisingly, the sponsor, Johnson Wax Company, believed that there were too many Westerns (thirty at the time) on network television and wanted to replace one of their own with a sitcom. Dick Powell was out of the country, and Spelling had moved on to another project. With no strong advocates for survival, Johnny Ringo was cancelled after one season of thirty-eight episodes. Neither NBC nor ABC were interested in taking over production of Johnny Ringo. Durant continued to make personal appearances (which paid more than his television salary had), guest-starred in CBS's Perry Mason and The Twilight Zone, and was nearly cast opposite Lucille Ball in her Broadway debut, Wildcat!, which flopped. Durant signed a contract with another studio, but aside from a 1963 guest role on NBC's Laramie western series with John Smith and Robert Fuller as Slim Sherman and Jess Harper, respectively, few offers materialized. On Laramie, Durant was cast as Gandy Ross, a likable safecracker trying to go straight, in the episode \\"No Place to Run\\". Later years Durant bought out his contract in 1964; and, because big bands had faded in the pop music fever, he subsequently retired from show business. Instead, he spent much of his time with his family and supervised his real estate and investment holdings. He had shrewdly invested his television earnings and became a millionaire many times over. Durant held no bitterness over the end of his fame and in later years communicated extensively with Johnny Ringo fans through his website. Among his last television appearances were two 1966 episodes of CBS's Wild Wild West, with Robert Conrad. The Durants were benefactors of Chapman University in Orange County, which is known for its School of Film and Television. They were in attendance when Chapman awarded an honorary degree in 2002 to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. This was more than a year before Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California. In 1992, Durant contracted chronic lymphocytic leukemia and, thereafter, lymphoma. In early 2005, he contracted a lung infection but was not hospitalized. He soon died at his home in Monarch Beach, California. He was buried at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar, California. The Durants had a son, Jeff, and a daughter, Heidi.

The film is set and was filmed in France, though the characters speak entirely in English. Hepburn's clothes were designed by Givenchy. Plot Prominent Paris art collector Charles Bonnet forges and sells famous artists' paintings. His disapproving daughter, Nicole, constantly fears that he will be caught. Late one night at their mansion, Nicole encounters a burglar, Simon Dermott, holding her father's forged \\"Van Gogh.\\" She threatens him with an antique gun that accidentally fires, slightly wounding his arm. Wanting to avoid an investigation that would uncover her father's fake masterpieces, Nicole does not contact the police, and instead takes the charming Simon to his posh hotel, driving him in his expensive sports car. For an important exhibition in Paris, Charles is lending to the Kléber-Lafayette Museum his renowned \\"Cellini\\" Venus statuette that was actually sculpted by his father. Charles has never sold it because scientific testing would reveal that the \\"million-dollar\\" artwork is fake, and his entire collection would then be suspected. Charles signs the museum's standard insurance policy, unaware that it also includes his consent to just such a forensic examination. But withdrawing the Venus from the exhibition would also raise suspicions. Nicole, desperate to protect her father, seeks out Simon and asks him to steal the Venus before the examination. Unknown to Nicole, Simon is actually an expert consultant and investigator hired by major art galleries to enhance security and detect forgeries. He was investigating Charles' art collection when Nicole first encountered him. He agrees to help Nicole, though he initially believes that it is impossible to steal the Venus in any case. American tycoon Davis Leland, an avid art collector, becomes obsessed with owning the Venus. He meets Nicole solely to purchase the statue, but instantly falls in love. At their second meeting, he proposes marriage, but Nicole must rush off to the museum for the \\"heist\\", so she accepts his ring. Nicole and Simon hide in a utility closet until closing time. After observing the guards' routine, Simon repeatedly sets off the security alarm until the \\"faulty\\" system is finally disabled. Simon notices Nicole's resemblance to the Venus, and she admits that her grandfather sculpted the statuette and that her grandmother was the model. Simon steals the Venus, and Nicole, disguised as a cleaning woman, hides it in a bucket. When the Venus is discovered missing, they escape in the ensuing chaos. Following the robbery, Leland seeks to acquire the Venus by any means. Simon connives to \\"sell\\" it to him on condition that it never be displayed to anyone and that he never contact the Bonnet family again; Leland should expect to eventually be asked for payment. Simon secretly adds Nicole's engagement ring to the package. Nicole meets Simon to celebrate their success. Simon says the Cellini Venus was his first heist too, reveals his true identity and declares his love for Nicole. He then meets Charles and assures him that the statue will be safely out of the country. Charles is so relieved that he is only momentarily disappointed when Simon says that the purchase price was zero dollars. (And because the statuette was never authenticated, there is no insurance.) Simon tells Charles that one of them must retire, and Charles agrees to give up forgery. As Nicole and Simon prepare to elope, a collector who had earlier admired Charles's new \\"Van Gogh\\" arrives at the Bonnet residence and is warmly welcomed by the wily forger. Nicole says the man is a \\"cousin.\\" Simon admires her newfound flair for lying.

The Australian colonial slab hut-type homestead is located approximately south of Dubbo in the Dubbo Regional Council local government area of New South Wales, on Obley Road, set on the bank of the Macquarie River. The homestead was built in by John Maughan and is also known as Dundullimal. The property is owned by National Trust of Australia, NSW branch. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002, and is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. The homestead is located further than Western Plains Zoo on Obley Road. Driving time is approximately eight minutes from the Dubbo central business district, and the property can also be accessed via the Tracker Riley cycle way. The building is administered by the National Trust and has become a major and significant tourist attraction in the Dubbo area, attracting large numbers of visitors from all around the country. The property is open Tuesday - Saturday 11am-3pm and by special arrangements to visit at other times (e.g. for school visits or bus groups). Dundullimal Homestead and grounds are also booked extensively as a venue for weddings, art exhibitions, concerts and parties.  History  In 1826, Governor Darling established an area known as the \\"limits of location\\", outside which settlement was not permitted. This area comprised 19 counties stretching from north of the Hunter Valley to Yass in the south and west to Wellington. Squatters, however, took their stock beyond these limits, taking up large tracts of land. In 1836 in an attempt to control this occupation, licences were granted to \\"de-pasture\\" beyond the limits of location. The licences were renewable each year and the squatters had no legal rights to any particular tract of land. The \\"runs\\" they occupied were determined by agreement amongst themselves. The colony beyond the limits of location was divided into nine squatting districts. Dundullimal Run is situated in what was the Wellington Squatting District which lay between the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers. In 1848 following pressure from these licensees to have security of tenure, regulations were passed which granted leases of eight or fourteen years, depending on the district. At the end of the lease the occupying tenant could purchase land under pre-emptive right. The Robertson Land Act of 1861 opened up all Crown Lands including the leased area to free selection before survey and reduced the tenure of the pastoral leases. Lease holders also purchased portions of their runs under the provisions of this Act. The Crown Lands Act of 1884 required that each pastoral holding (as a run was now called) be divided into a \\"leasehold area\\" and a \\"resumed area\\". While maintaining the principle of free selection before survey, the Act gave fixity of tenure to the pastoral leases. Hence the resumed area was available for selection though it could be occupied under licence by the lessee of the pastoral holding until such time as it was selected. In 1895 an Act was passed which converted the leasehold area to a resumed area on the expiry of the pastoral lease. However, the holder could continue occupation by acquiring a preferential occupation licence. Dundullimal Dundullimal is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"thunderstorm\\" or \\"hailstorm\\" and was the name of the local Aboriginal group. The first reference to the name was in September 1838 in a letter written from Dundullimal by H. F. Gisborne. Built around 1840 as the head station of this squatting run, the Dundullimal homestead is believed to be the oldest surviving slab hut house in Australia. The homestead is also Dubbo's oldest building open to the public. Its interior is relatively sophisticated for its type, with an imposing sitting room and is noted for its tent-shaped plaster ceiling, and wallpaper reproduced from an 1850 pattern. The house is furnished with original period furniture. The working areas include sandstone stables, the blacksmith's forge, coach room, sunken cool room and stores. This complex of buildings reflects the practical elements of rural life on a large, isolated property during the nineteenth century. =Construction and early ownership= The date on which the area was taken up is unknown. The first recorded occupants were brothers Charles Campbell and Dalmahoy Campbell. Dalmahoy applied for a de-pasturing licence in 1836 for the Wellington Valley. By 1839 both Charles and Dalmahoy were listed as the licence holders and H. Price was the superintendent. There was a slab hut and woolshed, 25 acres of wheat and stock consisting of 360 cattle, eight horses and 933 sheep. There were over 20 people in residence; 14 free persons (13 males and 1 female all over the age of 12 years) in addition to five male convicts and one female convict. Dalmahoy was listed as the only licensee in January 1840 though both he, Charles and Price were listed as licensees from July 1840 to June 1841 and, in 1841-1842, \\"Campbell and Price\\" held the licence. In 1828 John Maugham, a retired army officer, came to New South Wales and became a wealthy merchant. He had the house built, having acquired the property in 1842. Maughan was listed as holding the licence, paying the yearly licence on 10 June 1842. In 1844 Commissioner Wright visited Dundullimal and recorded that Maughan was both licensee and superintendent. There were 12 people in residence and there was a cottage, store, kitchen, stable, smithy, woolshed and paddocks. From successive lists it appears that both Maughan and Alexander Cruickshank jointly supervised the run. In 1848 Maughan tendered for and received a lease for Dundullimal. In March 1855, Surveyor Davidson surveyed 160 acres \\"applied for by Mr Maughan\\". Presumably this would have been a pre-emptive purchase. Maughan was to in fact purchase though when later surveyed, his block (now Portion 159, Parish of Dubbo, County Gordon) was found to be only and he was accordingly refunded A£7. The block contained the head station and woolshed and secured access to the Macquarie River. The next owners, E. B. Cornish and W. W. Brocklehurst, were English gentry with influential connections. Dundullimal was advertised for sale in February and March 1858, though it was not until December of that year that ownership of Portion 159 transferred to E. B. Cornish and Walter W. Brockelhurst. The actual lease of the run was transferred to Cornish and Brocklehurst in February 1859. Cornish and Brockelhurst purchased an area of adjacent to Portion 159 under pre-emptive right in 1863 (now Portion 158 Parish Dubbo, County Gordon). Cornish quit his interest in the run in 1864. The run lease and title of Portion 159 passed to Walter Brockelhurst and his brother, Edward, while title to Portion 158 passed solely to Walter. The latter also selected a further three blocks adjacent to Portion 158 (now Portions 127,128 & 131) and eight blocks downstream of Portion 159 (now Portions 9-16). In 1870 Brocklehurst returned to England and his inheritance, Hanbury Hall in Cheshire. =Baird family= In 1871 the lease on the run was transferred to Thomas Baird who also purchased all the above freehold portions. Baird continued to purchase land and by 1884 was in possession of over . It was at this time that the Crown Land Act was passed requiring the lessee to divide the run (now a 'pastoral holding') into leasehold and resumed areas. The southern half became the leasehold area and contained a woolshed (in a different location to both the earlier and present woolshed), two wooden cottages, a hut and a number of dams while the northern resumed area contained only a dam and a tank. Both contained amounts of fencing. In 1891 the property was occupied by 13 males, four females and two male Aborigines. Thomas Baird died in 1914 and the property passed to his daughters, Kennedy McIntosh Fletcher, Annie E. Baird, Alice L. Palmer and Hannah M. Palmer, as tenants-in- common. In Hannah Palmer's son, Ralph (Pat) Palmer, became manager of the property. A watercolour painting by Miss Kennedy Baird and an 1860s photograph proved the houe had indeed been of Palladian composition with balancing pavilions. The Baird family held the property until 1943 when Kennedy Fletcher's quarter share was purchased by Ralph (Pat) Palmer. He continued buying these quarter shares until 1961 when he acquired the final share. Annie Baird and Alice Palmer lived at Dundullimal up until . The last occupant was Wallis Fletcher (a great grandson of Thomas Baird) who vacated the house in . In the following year the house was flooded for the first time. After that time the house was used as a hay shed and cattle shelter. The property was subject to vandalism and it is believed that at one time Ralph (Pat) Palmer considered demolishing the house to prevent further such vandalism occurring. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) recorded the property a heritage listing in July 1973 and a heritage classification it in May 1986, by which it was severely dilapidated. The property was held under Ralph Palmer's sole freehold ownership until his death in 1982. Palmer's last manager was Kevin Hartley who died in 1986. =Transfer to the National Trust of Australia (NSW)= The property with the exception of the portion on which the early head station stands is currently owned by the Palmer family and is managed by John Macarthur. The family decided to grant the portion of land on which the early head station stands to the National Trust. In the buildings and were gifted to the National Trust by the Palmer family, descendants of Thomas Baird. A Bicentennial Commonwealth government grant, together with the support of then Trust DIrector, the late Peter James, and builder Garry Waller, made it possible to restore the complex and it was opened to the public in 1988l Later that year the Royal Australian Institute of Architects awarded its architects the Lachlan Macquarie Award for the best restoration project in Australia. Since then Dundullimal has been used by the National Trust as a working museum. The National Trust reported during 2008-9 that an operational windmill and water tanks were reinstated at Dundullimal, dramatically reducing the property's reliance on town water. In 2014 a bequest to the National Trust by Barbara West allowed restoration of the homestead and stables, and major upgrade works to create the Shed Function Centre. In August 2013 the Timbrebongie Church was moved to a new permanent home in the grounds of Dundullimal. In November 2013 the first wedding was held in the church, built by the paternal uncle of Saint Mary McKillop. The church relocation was funded by a Government of New South Wales community building partnerships grant and donations by Trust members including a targeted appeal. In 2015 the Shed Function Centre was completed, with modern kitchen and facilities. The farm museum and modern cafe are proving increasingly popular with visitors. A NSW Government community grant of $35,542 allowed the Trust to restore the stock yards and eastern skillion of the shed, which had been deteriorating and collapsed in the storms of 2013-14.  Description Site= The site is roughly rectangular and sits to the east of the Dubbo Railway line, with a level crossing half way along its length, south of the homestead and north of the stables. An access road used (1986) to go under the railway and approach the homestead group from the north, curving to the group's east and splitting into two drives alongside (parallel) to the stables, around a eucalypt. The 19th century Wellington-Dubbo Road and former entrance run along (and inside) the site's southern boundary, parallel to it. These cross the railway line to the homestead group's south-west. The site has a cluster of buildings (see below). Two yards surround the homestead and the stables/outbuilding/shed in the site's centre. A set of small yards also surround the outbuilding. A bog is to the east-north-east of the homestead and two wells, one with a windmill are on site. A range of trees on site include a quince (Cydonia oblonga cv.) in the north-western corner, a fig (Ficus carica cv.) in the north-east near the access road. a kurrajong (Brachychiton acerifolium) east of the former kitchen's site, a silky oak (c.2.5m from the western wall of the homestead), a row of three peppercorns (Schinus molle var. areira) east of the kurrajong, another peppercorn and a eucalypt just south of fence dividing the homestead yard and stables yard, two further eucalypts straddling the \\"inner\\" split drive east of the stables and another eucalypt south-west of the stables. Since 1986, broadly the two yards (paddocks) around the homestead and stables are now one paddock, which is \\"framed\\" by perimeter plantings of a range of species. Within this \\"frame\\" a few specimen trees exist closer to the buildings. Further shrubs line a fence between the stables' south-east corner and the outbuilding's north-western corner and run along its western side to the southern fence. A driveway crosses the railway line at the level crossing, turns south and runs close and parallel to the railway line to form a \\"carriage loop\\" south of the fence running east-west to the southern wall of the outbuilding (shed)'s southern wall (i.e. around and south of the homestead/stables/outbuilding/garden \\"paddock\\". Plants lining the northern fenceline (running west-east) include a flowering Prunus sp./cv., nectarine (Prunus persica cv.), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), canna lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica), iris sp., daisy, box elder (Acer negundo), apricot (Prunus armenaica cv.), firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), daisy, honeysuckle (Lonicera sp./cv.), canna lily (Canna edulis cv.), chrysanthemum cv., gladiolus cv., winter honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima), saisy, honeysuckle, jonquils (Narcissus tazetta cv.), lilies (Lilium sp./cv.), daisy, geranium (Pelargonium hortorum cv.), rose (Rosacv.), honeysuckle, succulent, creeper, rhododendron, daisy, Norfolk Island hibiscus (Lagunaria patersonia), the succulent Aloe vera and a peach (Prunus persica cv.). Running north-south along the eastern \\"paddock/garden\\" fence are ash (Fraxinus sp.) oleander (Nerium oleander), butterfly bush (Cassia sp.: 2) (outside the fence to the east are the three peppercorn trees still), another ash, a holly grape (Mahonia sp.), wattle (Acacia sp.), hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha), oleander, crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica cv.), peppercorn, peach, ash, elm/ash, ash (outside the fence to the east, adjacent are another Norfolk Island hibiscus and an unnamed tree), and further south east of the homestead, another Norfolk Island hibiscus and a Cherokee rose (Rosa laevigata). Lining the \\"paddock/garden\\" fence south of the 'driveway bend south) are a hedge of lavender (Lavandula sp.), succulent Agave sp., bulbs, a peppercorn tree, a fig/privet (Ligustrum sp.), an apricot, (in the south-western corner, an ash). Running along the southern \\"paddock/garden\\" fence are three peppercorn trees, a grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana), a jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), another ash, a Norfolk Island hibiscus and a silky oak west of the outbuilding. Running west of the outbuilding (shed) and its internal fence to the stables, from south-north, are three silky oaks, an ash tree, two eucalypts, another ash tree, daisy, geranium, box elder, rhododendron and an oleander bush. North of the yard north of the outbuilding (shed) are another ash and a Norfolk Island hibiscus. Another Cherokee rose is inside the aforementioned yard. Between the stables and the homestead are a peppercorn and eucalypt trees (north- north-east) and (further north-west near the driveway \\"bend\\" south, another eucalypt. Around the homestead, starting on the southern side are a butterfly bush on the south-west corner, an unnamed bush on the south-east corner, a daisy bush, rhododendron, oleander, ash (around the fence around the former kitchen site east of the homestead), a wild rose, a banksia bush (northeastern side of house), the climber Wisteria sinensis, violets and jonquils a daisy bush and a rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to the house's north and another rose (north-west side). =Homestead= Cottage ornee, the best and most sophisticated house of its type in the country. 'T-shaped' in plan with projecting room on its north elevation. A watercolour (painting) and an 1860s photograph proved the house had indeed been of Palladian composition with balancing pavilions. It is built on the same axis as its stone stables and coach house. A low cobbled verandah runs along the north elevation and around the projecting room. There is a verandah along the south elevation flanked by two box rooms. The main roof is hipped in form. The building is formed from yellow box vertical slabs fitted into a framework of posts and channelled plates. Rustic ceilings are of cypress pine board resting on exposed beams, with a coffered board ceiling in the main sitting room. The main roof and verandah rafters are formed of unhewn cypress poles. A shingle roof is now covered by corrugated galvanised iron. Windows are twelve pane sashes, the upper sash has eight panes, the lower four. Extraordinary glazing patterns. The structure has two distinct types of plastering: limewash over a float coat and a set coat over a float coat. The internal doors and skirtings are cypress pine. The remaining (and fine) joinery is red cedar. Smart early Victorian wallpaper, ledged pine cottage doors. There was a butler's pantry and a springbell system. The homestead group of outbuildings comprise stone stables, a coach house / outbuilding, located south-west of the homestead and stables, the site of the former kitchen, located east of homestead, and the site of the former privy, located east of the homestead and former kitchen site). Also located on the site are a windmill and well, located north of the homestead, another well, located south-east of the homestead, equidistant between it and the stables, a silo, located south of the stables, a sump, located east of the silo, and the header tank, located east of the homestead. = Condition = As at 25 March 2002, the physical condition was good.

Location of the templeThe Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, also known as the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus (; ; English: \\"Temple of Jupiter, the Best and Greatest\\") was the most important temple in Ancient Rome, located on the Capitoline Hill. It was surrounded by the Area Capitolina, a precinct where numerous shrines, altars, statues and victory trophies were displayed. The first building was the oldest large temple in Rome, and, like many temples in central Italy, shared features with Etruscan architecture. It was traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,Ab urbe condita, 2.8 and in 83 BC was destroyed by fire, and a replacement in Greek style completed in 69 BC (there were to be two more fires and new buildings). For the first temple sources report Etruscan specialists being brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the Temple of Zeus or upper parts, such as antefixes.Stamper, 12–13; Galluccio, 237–291 But for the second building they were summoned from Greece, and the building was presumably essentially Greek in style, though like other Roman temples it retained many elements of Etruscan form. The two further buildings were evidently of contemporary Roman style, although of exceptional size. The first version is the largest Etruscan-style temple recorded,Christofani; Boethius, 47 and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after. However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been claimed to have been almost , not far short of the largest Greek temples.Boethius, 47–48 Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long- lasting.Stamper, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2. Stamper is a leading protagonist of a smaller size, rejecting the larger size proposed by the late Einar Gjerstad. Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching down the sides, though not round the back wall as it would have done in a typical Greek temple.Christofani A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busy roofline.Denarius of 78 BC With two further fires, the third temple only lasted five years, to 80 AD, but the fourth survived until the fall of the empire. Remains of the last temple survived to be pillaged for spolia in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but now only elements of the foundations and podium or base survive; as the subsequent temples apparently reused these, they may partly date to the first building. Much about the various buildings remains uncertain. HistoryFirst building= Much of what is known of the first Temple of Jupiter is from later Roman tradition. Lucius Tarquinius Priscus vowed this temple while battling with the Sabines and, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, began the terracing necessary to support the foundations of the temple.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 3.69 Modern coring on the Capitoline has confirmed the extensive work needed just to create a level building site. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy, the foundations and most of the superstructure of the temple were completed by Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 4.61; Livy History 1.55–56.1 Livy also records that before the temple's construction shrines to other gods occupied the site. When the augurs carried out the rites seeking permission to remove them, only Terminus and Juventas were believed to have refused. Their shrines were therefore incorporated into the new structure. Because he was the god of boundaries, Terminus's refusal to be moved was interpreted as a favorable omen for the future of the Roman state. A second portent was the appearance of the head of a man to workmen digging the foundations of the temple. This was said by the augurs (including augurs brought especially from Etruria) to mean that Rome was to be the head of a great empire.Livy Ab urbe condita 1.55 Traditionally the Temple was dedicated on September 13, the founding year of the Roman Republic, 509 BC according to Livy.Ab urbe condita, 2.8 According to Dionysius, it was consecrated two years later in 507 BC. It was sacred to the Capitoline Triad consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, Juno and Minerva. The man to perform the dedication of the temple was chosen by lot. The duty fell to Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, one of the consuls in that year.Tacitus, quoted in Aicher 2004, p. 51 Livy records that in 495 BC the Latins, as a mark of gratitude to the Romans for the release of 6,000 Latin prisoners, delivered a crown of gold to the temple.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.22 The original temple may have measured almost , though this estimate is hotly disputed by some specialists.;;;;. It was certainly considered the most important religious temple of the whole state of Rome. Each deity of the Triad had a separate cella, with Juno Regina on the left, Minerva on the right, and Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the middle. The first temple was decorated with many terra cotta sculptures. The most famous of these was of Jupiter driving a quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses, which was on top of the roof as an acroterion. This sculpture, as well as the cult statue of Jupiter in the main cella, was said to have been the work of Etruscan artisan Vulca of Veii.Pliny the Elder, Encyclopedia 35.157 An image of Summanus, a thunder god, was among the pedimental statues.Cicero, On Divination 1.16 The original temple decoration was discovered in 2014.The findings allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct for the first time the real appearance of the temple in the earliest phase.Galluccio 2016, 237–250, fig. 9 The wooden elements of the roof and lintels were lined with terracotta revetment plaques and other elements of exceptional size and richly decorated with painted reliefs, following the so-called Second Phase model (referring to the decorative systems of Etruscan and Latin temples), that had its first expression precisely with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The temple, which immediately rose to fame, established a new model for sacred architecture that was adopted in the terracotta decorations of many temples in Italy up to the 2nd century BC. The original elements were partially replaced with other elements in different style in the early 4th century BC and anew at the end of 3rd – beginning 2nd century BC. The removed material was dumped into the layers forming the square in front of the temple, the so-called Area Capitolina, in the middle years the 2nd century BC.Galluccio 2016, 250 – 256, figs. 10–13 The plan and exact dimensions of the temple have been heavily debated. Five different plans of the temple have been published following recent excavations on the Capitoline Hill that revealed portions of the archaic foundations.;;;;. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the same plan and foundations were used for later rebuildings of the temple,Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 4.61.4 but there is disagreement over what the dimensions he mentions referred to (the building itself or the podium). In 437 BC Aulus Cornelius Cossus unhorsed the Veientes' King Lars Tolumnius and struck him down. After taking the linen cuirass off Tolumnius' body, he decapitated the corpse and put the head on a lance and paraded it in front of the enemy, who retreated in horror. Cossus donated the captured armour, shield and sword to the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitoline Hill, where as late as the reign of Emperor Augustus it could be seen. The first temple burned in 83 BC, during the civil wars under the dictatorship of Sulla. Also lost in this fire were the Sibylline Books, which were said to have been written by classical sibyls, and stored in the temple (to be guarded and consulted by the quindecimviri (council of fifteen) on matters of state only on emergencies). File:Tempio di giove capitolino, pianta.pngSpeculative plan of the first temple File:Templum Iovis Capitolini.PNGAnother of the many guesses at a plan File:Temple Jupiter Optimus Maximus.JPGBack wall in 2005 =Second building= Coin of 78 BC, during the building of the second temple During Lucius Cornelius Sulla's sack of Athens in 86 BC, while looting the city, Sulla seized some of the gigantic incomplete columns from the Temple of Zeus and transported them back to Rome, where they were re-used in the Temple of Jupiter. Sulla hoped to live until the temple was rebuilt, but Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus) had the honor of dedicating the new structure in 69 BC.Pliny NH 7.138; Tacitus Hist. 3.72.3. The new temple was built to the same plan on the same foundations, but with more expensive materials for the superstructure. Literary sources indicate that the temple was not entirely completed until the late 60s BC. Brutus and the other assassins locked themselves inside it after murdering Caesar. The new temple of Quintus Lutatius Catulus was renovated and repaired by Augustus. The second building burnt down during the course of fighting on the hill on 19 December of 69 AD, when an army loyal to Vespasian battled to enter the city in the Year of the Four Emperors.Tacitus Hist. 3.71–72 =Third building= The new emperor, Vespasian, rapidly rebuilt the temple on the same foundations but with a lavish superstructure. The third temple of Jupiter was dedicated in 75 AD. The third temple burned during the reign of Titus in 80 AD. =Fourth building= Relief of Marcus Aurelius sacrificing at the fourth temple Domitian immediately began rebuilding the temple, again on the same foundations, but with the most lavish superstructure yet. According to Plutarch, Domitian used at least twelve thousands talents of gold for the gilding of the bronze roof tiles alone. Elaborate sculpture adorned the pediment. A Renaissance drawing of a damaged relief in the Louvre Museum shows a four-horse chariot (quadriga) beside a two-horse chariot (biga) to the right of the latter at the highest point of the pediment, the two statues serving as the central acroterion, and statues of the god Mars and goddess Venus surmounting the corners of the cornice, serving as acroteria. It was completed in A.D. 82. In the centre of the pediment the god Jupiter was flanked by Juno and Minerva, seated on thrones. Below was an eagle with wings spread out. A biga driven by the sun god and a biga driven by the moon were depicted either side of the three gods. After the emperor Theodosius I eliminated the public funding for upkeep of pagan temples in 392, it was spoliated several times through the Middle Ages. During the 16th century, it was subsumed into a large private residence, the Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino, which became part of the current-day Capitoline Hill. =Decline and abandonment= The temple completed by Domitian is thought to have lasted more or less intact for over three hundred years, until all pagan temples were closed by emperor Theodosius I in 392 during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. During the 5th century the temple was damaged by Stilicho (who according to Zosimus removed the gold that adorned the doors) and Gaiseric (Procopius states that the Vandals plundered the temple during the sack of Rome in 455, stripping away the roof shingles made of gold and bronze). In 571, Narses removed many of the statues and ornaments. The ruins were still well preserved in 1447 when the 15th-century humanist Poggio Bracciolini visited Rome. The remaining ruins were destroyed in the 16th century, when Giovanni Pietro Caffarelli built a palace (Palazzo Caffarelli) on the site reusing material from the temple. Remains Podium wall in the basement of the Musei Capitolini Today, portions of the temple podium and foundations can be seen behind the Palazzo dei Conservatori, in an exhibition area built in the Caffarelli Garden, and within the Musei Capitolini.; A part of the front corner is also visible in the via del Tempio di Giove. The second Medici lion was sculpted in the late 16th century by Flaminio Vacca from a capital from the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.Giovanna Giusti Galardi: The Statues of the Loggia Della Signoria in Florence: Masterpieces Restored, Florence 2002. Area Capitolina The Area Capitolina was the precinct on the southern part of the Capitoline that surrounded the Temple of Jupiter, enclosing it with irregular retaining walls following the hillside contours.Livy 25.3.14; Velleius Paterculus 2.3.2; Aulus Gellius 2.102; Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 31. The precinct was enlarged in 388 BC,Livy 6.4.12; Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary, p. 31. to about 3,000m2.Adam Ziolkowski, \\"Civic Rituals and Political Spaces in Republican and Imperial Rome,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 398. The Clivus Capitolinus ended at the main entrance in the center of the southeast side, and the Porta Pandana seems to have been a secondary entrance; these gates were closed at night. The sacred geese of Juno, said to have sounded the alarm during the Gallic siege of Rome, were kept in the Area,Cicero, Rosc. Am. 56; Gellius 6.1.6; Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary, p. 31. which was guarded during the Imperial period by dogs kept by a temple attendant. Domitian hid in the dog handler's living quarters when the forces of Vitellius overtook the Capitoline.Tacitus, Histories 3.75; Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary, p. 31. Underground chambers called favissae held damaged building materials, old votive offerings, and dedicated objects that were not suitable for display. It was religiously prohibited to disturb these. The precinct held numerous shrines, altars, statues, and victory trophies.Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary, p. 32. Some plebeian and tribal assemblies met there.Ziolkowski, \\"Civic Rituals and Political Spaces,\\" p. 398. In late antiquity, it was a market for luxury goods, and continued as such into the medieval period: in a letter from 468, Sidonius describes a shopper negotiating over the price of gems, silk, and fine fabrics.Sidonius Apollinaris, Epistulae 1.7.8; Claire Holleran, Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate (Oxford University Press, 2012), 251.

As a British prisoner of war during the Second World War, he was held captive at Colditz Castle when it was designated Oflag IV-C. Reid was one of the few to escape from Colditz, crossing the border into neutral Switzerland in late 1942. After the war Reid was a diplomat and administrator before eventually returning to his prewar career in civil engineering. He also wrote about his experiences in two best- selling books, which became the basis of a film, TV series, and even a board game. BiographyEarly life and education= Patrick Reid was born in Ranchi, India, the son of John Reid, CIE ICS, of Carlow, Ireland, and Alice Mabel Daniell. He was educated at Ladycross prep School, Seaford, Sussex, St. Dominic's Preparatory School, Cabra, County Dublin, Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare, and Wimbledon College, London, and graduated from King's College London in 1932. He then trained as a civil engineer, working for Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners from 1934 to 1937, and becoming an Associate Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1936. =Military service= Reid joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 16 June 1933 on the General List. He joined the Royal Army Service Corps (Supplementary Reserve) with the same rank on 5 June 1935. He was promoted to Lieutenant exactly three years later on 5 June 1938. Reid was mobilized for active duty on 24 August 1939, and served in the 2nd Infantry Division, receiving promotion to Temporary Captain on 1 December 1939. On 27 May 1940, while serving as a member of the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France, he was captured by the Germans near Cassel. He was sent to Laufen castle, Bavaria, designated Oflag VII-C, arriving there on 5 June 1940. Within days of his arrival, Reid was planning an escape, determined to return home by Christmas. After seven weeks digging Reid and a group of prisoners completed a tunnel, long, from the prison basement to a small shed adjoining a nearby house. At 06:30 on 5 September 1940, Reid and five others broke out and made for Yugoslavia, only 150 miles away. However, after five days the escapees were recaptured in Radstadt, Austria. Reid was sentenced to a month of solitary confinement, on a diet of bread and water. As one of the \\"Laufen Six\\", Reid was then sent to Colditz Castle, designated Oflag IV-C, a special \\"escape-proof\\" camp, arriving there on 10 November 1940. It was not long before Reid attempted an escape. He bribed a seemingly willing German guard to look the other way. On the night of 29 May 1941 twelve prisoners crawled through a sewer pipe from the canteen to an outer courtyard, planning to then descend a forty-foot wall, and then over another wall 12 feet high topped with barbed wire. However, although the guard had accepted the bribe, he also reported the escape plan to his superiors, and the Germans were waiting for them. After another spell in solitary, Reid accepted the position of Escape Officer, responsible for overseeing all British escape plans. Reid assisted in many escape attempts, some successful, until April 1942, when he was replaced as Escape Officer by fellow member of the \\"Laufen Six\\" Captain Richard \\"Dick\\" Howe. =Escaping Colditz= The German Kommandantur in 2011.Colditz Castle (1945) Reid finally took his own chance to escape on the night of 14/15 October 1942, along with Major Ronald Littledale, Lieutenant Commander William L. Stephens RNVR, and Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle RAF. They cut through the bars on a window in the prisoners' kitchen, and climbed out onto the flat roof of the German kitchen. They then crossed the brightly lit outer yard, and avoided being seen by a guard. They entered a storage cellar under the Kommandantur (Commandant's HQ), crawled out through a narrow air shaft leading to the dry moat, and exited through the park. They split into pairs, with Reid and Wardle disguised as Flemish workmen travelling by train to Tuttlingen, near the Swiss border, via Zwickau and Munich. They crossed the border near Ramsen on the evening of 18 October. Stephens and Littledale also travelled to Tuttlingen by train, via Chemnitz, Nuremberg and Stuttgart, then followed Reid and Wardle across the border in the early hours of 20 October. Reid remained in Switzerland until after the end of the war, serving as an Assistant Military Attaché in Berne from 9 March 1943 until early 1946, and receiving promotion to Temporary Major on 1 November 1945. He was unusually discreet about his duties there, and was in fact working for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) gathering intelligence from arriving escapees. =Post-war= Reid left the army on 29 March 1947, but remained a member of the Regular Army Reserve until reaching mandatory retirement age on 15 November 1965. On that day he was awarded the honorary rank of Major. Reid served in the British embassy at Ankara, Turkey, as First Secretary (Commercial) from 1946 until 1949, then as Chief Administrator for the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation in Paris, France, until 1952. He was adopted as a Prospective Parliamentary Candidate by the Conservative Party in 1953, but failed to win a seat in the 1955 election. Reid then returned to his prewar career in civil engineering, serving as a director of the construction companies Richard Costain (Projects) Ltd. and Richard Costain (Middle East) Ltd. between 1959 and 1962, and working for the consulting engineers W.S. Atkins & Partners in 1962–63. =Personal life= Reid was married three times; first in 1943 to Jane Cabot. They had three sons and two daughters, and were divorced in 1966. His second marriage in 1977 to Mary Stewart Cunliffe-Lister ended with her death in 1978. In 1982 he married his third wife, Nicandra Hood, but they separated after a few years. He died at the Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, on 22 May 1990, at the age of 79. =Other activities= Reid served as president of the Blackboys Cricket Club in Framfield, Sussex in 1972. Pat Reid actively went on lecture tours in the early 1970s with his models of Colditz Castle and other memorabilia, photographs etc. A kind, very modest, interesting and popular man. Awards For his \\"gallant and distinguished services in the field\\" during the Battle of France Reid was awarded the Military Cross on 4 May 1943, and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) on 20 December 1945. Publications * The Colditz Story (Hodder & Stoughton, 1952) was Reid's memoir of his time in Colditz, which later became the basis for the 1955 film The Colditz Story, directed by Guy Hamilton, with John Mills playing Reid. Although focusing mainly upon life inside Colditz and the development of an 'escape academy', the final chapters of the book are devoted to Reid's own escape. The book chronicles everyday prison life, in which characters such as Douglas Bader and Airey Neave appear with no special mention, reporting events in an anecdotal and almost comical style. On 14 October 1942 Reid, along three other British officers, escaped and made their way to neutral Switzerland. What Reid does not mention in his book is that he escaped using Hans Larive's Singen route. Larive, a Dutch naval lieutenant, attempted his first escape from Oflag VI-A in Soest in 1940, but was caught at the Swiss border. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive memorized the information, and many prisoners later escaped using this route. * The Latter Days (Hodder & Stoughton, 1953), republished as Latter Days at Colditz, also published with the title Men of Colditz: Whilst his first book ended with Reid and Wardle shaking hands under the first Swiss lamp post, the sequel follows the trials and tribulations of the escape committee until the eventual liberation of the castle by U.S. troops on 15 April 1945. It gives even more anecdotal insight into the events following his escape, including the French Tunnel and the Colditz Glider, or the occasion when the entire Dutch contingent unhooked their POW railway car from the rest of the train unbeknownst to the German guards.

He also gives a full account of how prisoners discovered the 'Singen Escape Route'. He also deals with some of the tensions and tragedies of wartime Europe, for example the tensions in the French contingents between Gaullists and supporters of Pétain.

Biography Cancer's first band was Castration Squad, an all-female punk band formed by Alice Bag of Bags. While a member of this band, Cancer used the moniker \\"Mary Bat-Thing\\". In 1979, 45 Grave was formed. The band also featured guitarist Paul Cutler (formerly of the Consumers), bassist Rob Graves (previously of Bags), drummer Don Bolles (previously of Germs and Nervous Gender) and keyboardist Paul Roessler (previously of the Screamers and Nervous Gender). In 1981, 45 Grave released their first single, \\"Black Cross\\", and contributed several songs to the compilation Hell Comes to Your House. Cancer was also a member of the 45 Grave-related band Vox Pop, and sang backup for Nervous Gender. Cancer dated Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe for a period in the early 1980s, before marrying Cutler while both were members of 45 Grave. The band broke up in 1985, the same year that their song \\"Partytime\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film Return of the Living Dead. They reformed in 1988 and released the live album Only the Good Die Young in 1989. The band came to a permanent halt with the 1990 death of Graves from a heroin overdose. Cancer remarried briefly and had two daughters named Ilse and Eirika before separating from her second husband. She returned to using her birth name, Mary Sims, becoming a preschool teacher and running the Ragnarok occult bookstore. In 1997, she formed the band Penis Flytrap, who released the mini album Tales of Terror (1998, Bloody Daggre Records) and the album Dismemberment (2001, Black Plague Records). Cancer and drummer Hal Satan left Penis Flytrap to form Dinah Cancer and the Grave Robbers. In 2004, 45 Grave reformed for their 25th anniversary, with Cancer as the only original member. Cancer said via her MySpace page: \\"I'm building this to keep the spirit of 45 Grave alive, introduce its magic to new fans, and as a personal commemorative of my best memories being the driving force and front person of 45 Grave\\". The reformed 45 Grave (featuring Rikk Agnew and later Frank Agnew) performed the title track to the 2009 horror film Night of the Demons, and released their second studio album, Pick Your Poison, in 2012 on Frontier Records.

Geography View of Tarvisio in 1915. The town is in the Canal Valley (Val Canale) between the Carnic Alps and Karawanks ranges in the north and the Julian Alps in the south. Located at the border with both Austria and Slovenia, Tarvisio and its neighbouring municipalities of Arnoldstein and Kranjska Gora form the tripoint of Romance, Germanic and Slavic Europe. The height west of the town centre marks the watershed between the Slizza creek, a tributary of the Gail River which is part of the Danube basin, and the Fella River, tributary of the Tagliamento discharging into the Adriatic Sea. Tarvisio together with the rest of the Canal Valley was part of Austria until 1919. Tarvisio has access to the A23 Alpe-Adria autostrada, part of the European route E55, running from the Austrian A2 Süd Autobahn to Udine, and the A4 autostrada at Palmanova. The Tarvisio railway station is located at the new Pontebbana line from Villach to Udine opened in 2000, that replaced the tracks of the former Austro-Hungarian k.k. Staatsbahn built in 1879. Climate Despite the modest elevation, the city has a continental climate with cold winters (lowest recorded temperature is in January 1985). Summers can be very hot (highest recorded temperature of in July 1983). Languages As a former component of the Austrian Empire, until 1918, the town, as was the rest of the Canal Valley, was overwhelmingly German- and Slovenian-speaking. Today the municipality speaks mostly Italian; German- speakers and Slovenes make up a substantial minority. In 2012, the mayor put up multilingual signs in four languages, Italian, German, Slovene, and the regional minority language of Friulian, saying \\"the inhabitants deserve to use their mother tongues freely.\\" Parishes The comune of Tarvisio includes the following frazioni (fractional parishes): :Names in: Italian (German, Slovene, Friulian): * Camporosso (Saifnitz, Žabnice, Cjamparos) * Cave del Predil (Raibl, Rabelj, Rabil/Predil) * Coccau (Goggau, Kokova, Cocau) * Fusine in Valromana (Weißenfels/Weissenfels, Fužine/Bela Peč, Fusinis) * Monte Lussari (Luschariberg, Sv.Višárje, Mont Sante di Lussàri) * Muda (Mauth, Múta, Mude) * Plezzut (Flitschl, Flíčl, Pleçùt) * Poscolle (Hinterschloss, Zágradec, Puscuèl) * Rutte (Greuth, Trbiške rute, Rute) * Sant'Antonio (Sankt Anton, Sant Antòni) * Riofreddo (Kaltwasser, Mrzla Voda) Riofreddo. Camporosso Church. History As a place upon ancient trade routes across the Alps to Venice, Tarvisio's roots date back to Roman times. In 1007 Emperor Henry II vested the newly created Diocese of Bamberg with the Carinthian Canal Valley down to Pontebba, a region which had considerable importance because of nearby ore mines and ironworks, especially around the village of Fusine in Valromana (Weißenfels/Bela Peč/\\"Fusinis\\"). Tarvisio remained a southern exclave of the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg, until in 1758 the bishop finally sold Tarvisio to the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Until 1918 it was part of the Duchy of Carinthia, it received town privileges in 1909. TARVIS in the Duchy of Carinthia (Austria-Hungary) in 1874 Main sights Mount Lussari Tarvisio features include the parish church Saints Peter and Paul, built in the 15th century, as well as sceneries like the Fusine laghi mountain lakes. At the summit of the Mount Lussari (, , ) is a pilgrimage church, where according to legend in 1360 a shepherd discovered a statue of Virgin Mary. The church and the nearby ski centre can be reached by cable car from Malborghetto Valbruna. The area around the Sella Nevea mountain pass between Tarvisio and Chiusaforte is also a popular ski resort. Economy For decades, Tarvisio benefited economically from people coming from Austria and Yugoslavia for shopping trips. However, trade at the notorious \\"Rag Market\\" diminished after the implementation of Schengen Agreement and the establishment of the Eurozone. Today, tourism and winter sports in the Karawanks, the Carnic Alps, and the Julian Alps have become important industries. Tarvisio is known for its heavy alpine snow, which attracts many tourists for skiing and snowboarding, especially school groups. It was host to the 2003 Winter Universiade and the Women's 2007 Alpine Skiing World Cup.

Since the GAO is accountable only to the legislative branch, it is in a unique position to investigate the military; no other agency can audit Federal departments with the same degree of independence from the President. However, the GAO is still subject to influence from powerful members of Congress. As of March 2016, the DoD was the only government agency to have failed every audit since all government agencies were required to pass such audits by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. Two examples of major GAO investigations in the 2000s were the audits of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Defense Department airline reimbursements. Major investigationsOperation Iraqi Freedom= GAO investigations into Operation Iraqi Freedom revealed a number of accounting problems, ranging from the mundane to the severe. Pay irregularities were a chronic problem. In 2004 the GAO reported that 450 of the 481 Army National Guard soldiers from six Special Forces units had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization impacting 94 percent of the soldiers. The report found that the DoD's inability to provide timely and accurate payments to these soldiers, many of whom risked their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan, distracted them from their missions, imposed financial hardships on the soldiers and their families and may reduce retention. Procurement irregularities included Halliburton charging the government $5 for hot meals they got from a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Timimmi, for $3 each. In one camp in July 2003 they \\"billed the government for an average 42,000 meals a day but served only 14,000. In a seven-month period, alleged overcharging in that camp totalled $16m.\\" As the investigation into Iraqi Freedom progressed, it began turning up worse and worse procurement problems. GAO auditors caught the Department selling new chemical and biological protective garments on the Internet for $3 each. At the same time, the Pentagon was buying identical garments elsewhere for more than $200 apiece. Other accounting snafus resulted in the Army losing track of 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, and 36 Javelin missile command launch-units. In May 2003 SFGATE reported $1 trillion missing. The GAO found that the waste encountered in Iraq is symptomatic of a wider inventory-control problem. More than 200 inventory-control systems at the Defense Department still are not integrated. The GAO notes, \\"Poor communication between services within the Department of Defense and improper accounting results in the disposal of needed spare parts and the purchase of duplicative parts worth millions of dollars.\\" =Airline reimbursements= A more recent GAO investigation revealed $100 million in wasted airline fees. The Associated Press notes that the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over six years and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable. The Department also reimbursed employees for airline tickets that had been purchased by the Department. To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as Defense employees, had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass. The GAO also uncovered several incidences of airline-related fraud. One DoD traveler used a Department account number to pay for more than 70 airline tickets totaling more than $60,000. He then sold them at a discount to coworkers and family members for personal travel. Another employee admitted to \\"accidentally\\" claiming reimbursement for $10,000 worth of airline tickets that had been paid for by the Department. GAO influence over Defense Department reformDefense Department responses to investigations= There is evidence that GAO investigations are encouraging the Department to reform. The Halliburton contract was re-negotiated and assigned directly to Timimmi. And Dov Zakheim, chief financial officer for the Pentagon, said, \\"We are overhauling our financial management system precisely because people like [GAO Comptroller General] David Walker are rightly critical of it\\". These audits appear to have been more effective at prompting reform than the Defense Department's own initiatives. In 1989, the Department began attempting to unify more than 2,000 overlapping systems used for billing, inventory, and personnel. But after spending $20 billion, the initiative was abandoned. Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division, noted the Pentagon's weak fiscal control over its subsidiaries – the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines – saying, \\"The [Pentagon's] inability to even complete an audit shows just how far they have to go.\\" =Threats to GAO independence= Scholars believe, however, that the GAO's authority could be undermined in the wake of a landmark case, Walker vs. Cheney. This Federal lawsuit pertained to a GAO investigation into the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force. Vice President Richard Cheney refused to disclose which individuals and groups met with the Task Force, prompting Walker to sue for the information in Federal court. In December 2002, the court ruled for Cheney. Congressional pressure persuaded Walker to abandon appeals. Having vowed to \\"go to the mat,\\" he originally planned to pursue the case further. But the Center for Effective Government reported that, \\"Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, met with GAO Comptroller General David Walker earlier in [2003], and sources have reported that sharp cuts in the GAO $440 million budget were threatened if the lawsuit was pursued further. The GAO was designed to be independent, and Walker cites several factors insulating his agency from political pressure. In a Roll Call op-ed, he remarks, \\"To begin with, our location in the legislative branch gives us some distance from the executive branches we audit and oversee. Moreover, the head of GAO serves a 15-year term, which gives the agency a continuity of leadership that is rare in the federal government. GAO's independence is further safeguarded by the fact that its workforce consists of career civil servants hired on the basis of their knowledge, skill, and ability.\\" However, the GAO, like all federal agencies, is subject to Congress' budgetary power. According to The Hill, \\"Walker did say . . . that several lawmakers have threatened in the past year to cut agency funding if it persisted with the controversial lawsuit. He also said the budget threat was among a number of factors that tipped his Feb. 7 decision to halt litigation.\\" It is difficult to tell whether curtailed GAO independence will threaten Defense Department reform. Some aspects of Defense Department accounting have resisted reform for decades. Danielle Brian, director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, says, \\"Waste has become ingrained in the Defense budget because opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic, and legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon pork than controlling defense waste.\\" But even Representatives who generally support Defense spending seem to be getting fed up with the problem. Representative Thomas M. Davis, R-Virginia, asked the Pentagon to present 11 documents relating to contracts in Iraq, among them papers that would prove whether Halliburton benefited from its association with Cheney. And Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., of the House Committee on Government Reform recently said, \\"I've always considered myself to be a pro-military type person, but that doesn't mean I just want to sit back and watch the Pentagon waste billions and billions of dollars.\\" Supporters of the GAO investigations like to point out the disparity between the GAO budget and military expenses. The GAO's Fiscal Year 2016 annual budget was $555 million, with \\"Measurable financial benefits from GAO work: $63.4 billion--a return of about $112 on every dollar invested in GAO.\\" In contrast, GAO reports show that the Defense Department's 2,200 overlapping financial systems cost $18 billion a year to operate. In March 2016, the Project on Government Oversight reported that, \\"The Department of Defense remains the only federal agency that can't get a clean audit\\". DoD sources said, \\"I think we are on the right track [but] it will take a couple more years.\\" However, \\"unless efforts to hold the Pentagon accountable become law, it's unlikely that the largest government agency will be able to be audited any time soon.

Early life, education and family Born to Annie (née Lawrie) and James Mackintosh, Mackintosh was born in Inverness and raised primarily in Tain, a small town in the Scottish Highlands. His mother was a governess and his father was a naval officer. Educated at Inverness Royal Academy, Mackintosh initially applied to join the Fleet Air Arm as a pilot but was rejected due to poor eyesight. A subsequent application to join the Royal Air Force was also rejected for the same reason. After spending an additional year at school, Mackintosh applied for entry to Britannia Royal Naval College in 1958 to train as a Royal Navy officer and was accepted. In September 1969, he married Sharron Carter, daughter of a Royal Navy officer, and they had two daughters. Mackintosh and Carter subsequently divorced. Career Mackintosh's first novel, A Slaying in September, was published in 1967. He wrote four other original novels between 1967 and 1970; his later books were either based on his television series, or were novelizations of televised episodes of his television series. Whilst serving as a Royal Navy officer, Mackintosh co-created the popular and acclaimed BBC television drama series Warship (1973–1977) and wrote several of its episodes. It was set on board the fictional HMS Hero (F42), which was portrayed by the real Leander-class frigate . Mackintosh was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 Birthday Honours on his retirement from the Royal Navy. Employed at Yorkshire Television as a screenwriter after Warship, Mackintosh created and wrote most of the episodes of Wilde Alliance, Thundercloud, and The Sandbaggers. Disappearance On the evening of 7 July 1979, Mackintosh was flying with two others (his friend and an experienced British Airways captain Graham Barber, who was the pilot; and Mackintosh's girlfriend, Susan Insole) over the Gulf of Alaska in a light aircraft. The plane sent out a distress signal, which was picked up by the United States Coast Guard. The plane's last-known position was searched, but no wreckage of the plane was ever found, and its passengers have not been heard from since.\\"Did spy writer's disappearance mirror his fiction?\\", John O'Groat Journal and Caithness Courier, 3 January 2013.

The family name meant \\"nightingale\\" in French. As early as 1406 the word rossignol has served as the French term for \\"skeleton key\\" or for any tool which opens that which is locked. Antoine Rossignol In 1626, Henri II of Bourbon, Prince de Condé laid siege to the Huguenot city of Réalmont. The besiegers intercepted a coded letter leaving the city. Rossignol, then a 26-year-old mathematician, had a local reputation for his interest in cryptography. He quickly broke the Huguenot cipher, revealing a plea to their allies for ammunition to replenish the city's almost exhausted supplies. The next day, the besiegers presented the clear text of the message to the commander of Réalmont, along with a demand for surrender: the Huguenots surrendered immediately. Antoine Rossignol. This brought Rossignol to the attention of Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, who found secure ciphers and codes of immense use to his diplomatic and intelligence corps. Rossignol repeated his swift decipherment of Huguenot messages at the siege of La Rochelle in 1628. Rossignol improved the nomenclators (cipher tables) used by the French court for their own dispatches. A nomenclator comprises a hybrid of code and cipher. Notable important words go into code rather than getting spelled out, while the bulk of the message consists of simple cipher. Before, to make them compact, the alphabetical order of the clear words would correspond closely to the order of the code, so that the codes for the English words \\"Artois\\", \\"Bavaria\\", \\"cannon\\" and \\"castle\\", would appear in that order. Rossignol insisted on using out-of-order correspondences, necessitating the use of two tables, one for clear text to code, the other for code to clear text, organized to make finding the first element easy, without reference to the order of the second. The Abbé de Boisrobert wrote a poem in praise of Rossignol, Epistres en Vers. Later generations In the era of Louis XIV of France (reigned 1643–1715), Antoine Rossignol and his son, worked either at their estate at Juvisy near Paris or in a room next to the King's study at Versailles. For him they developed the Great Cipher (also called the Grand Cipher) of Louis XIV. They alone mastered it, encoding letters, memoranda, and records. The Rossignols ran the Cabinet noir, the French Black Chamber (founded when Louvois served as Minister of War), so notable that \\"black chamber\\" became an international term for any code bureau. A generation later, when Bonaventure's son, Antoine-Bonaventure, died, the Grand Cipher fell out of use. Without the key, and even the base concept, it remained uncrackable until the late 19th century, when Etienne Bazeries deciphered it after three years of work. Until this time, historians remained unable to read the coded diplomatic records of the time in the French archives. Antoine Rossignol had the title of \\"King's counselor\\". Both Bonaventure and Antoine-Bonaventure Rossignol reached the position of \\"president of the Chamber of Accounts.\\" In fiction Bonaventure Rossignol is an important character in The Baroque Cycle series by Neal Stephenson.

Applying the baker's map to this image always results in exactly the same image. In dynamical systems theory, the baker's map is a chaotic map from the unit square into itself. It is named after a kneading operation that bakers apply to dough: the dough is cut in half, and the two halves are stacked on one another, and compressed. The baker's map can be understood as the bilateral shift operator of a bi-infinite two-state lattice model. The baker's map is topologically conjugate to the horseshoe map. In physics, a chain of coupled baker's maps can be used to model deterministic diffusion. As with many deterministic dynamical systems, the baker's map is studied by its action on the space of functions defined on the unit square. The baker's map defines an operator on the space of functions, known as the transfer operator of the map. The baker's map is an exactly solvable model of deterministic chaos, in that the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the transfer operator can be explicitly determined. Formal definition There are two alternative definitions of the baker's map which are in common use. One definition folds over or rotates one of the sliced halves before joining it (similar to the horseshoe map) and the other does not. The folded baker's map acts on the unit square as :S_\\\\text{baker-folded}(x, y) = \\\\begin{cases} (2x, y/2) & \\\\text{for } 0 \\\\le x < \\\\frac{1}{2}  (2-2x, 1-y/2) & \\\\text{for } \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\le x < 1\\\\. \\\\end{cases} When the upper section is not folded over, the map may be written as :S_\\\\text{baker-unfolded}(x,y)= \\\\left(2x-\\\\left\\\\lfloor 2x\\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\,,\\\\,\\\\frac{y+\\\\left\\\\lfloor 2x\\\\right\\\\rfloor }{2}\\\\right). The folded baker's map is a two-dimensional analog of the tent map :S_\\\\mathrm{tent}(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 2x & \\\\text{for } 0 \\\\le x < \\\\frac{1}{2}  2(1-x) & \\\\text{for } \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\le x < 1 \\\\end{cases} while the unfolded map is analogous to the Bernoulli map. Both maps are topologically conjugate. The Bernoulli map can be understood as the map that progressively lops digits off the dyadic expansion of x. Unlike the tent map, the baker's map is invertible. Properties The baker's map preserves the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Repeated application of the baker's map to points colored red and blue, initially separated. After several iterations, the red and blue points seem to be completely mixed. The map is strong mixing and it is topologically mixing. The transfer operator U maps functions of the unit square to other functions on the unit square; it is given by :\\\\left[Uf\\\\right](x,y) = (f\\\\circ S^{-1}) (x,y). The origin unit square is on top and the bottom shows the result as the square is swept from left to right. The transfer operator is unitary on the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the unit square. The spectrum is continuous, and because the operator is unitary the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle. The transfer operator is not unitary on the space \\\\mathcal{P}_x\\\\otimes L^2_y of functions polynomial in the first coordinate and square-integrable in the second. On this space, it has a discrete, non-unitary, decaying spectrum. As a shift operator The baker's map can be understood as the two-sided shift operator on the symbolic dynamics of a one-dimensional lattice. Consider, for example, the bi-infinite string :\\\\sigma=\\\\left(\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{-2},\\\\sigma_{-1},\\\\sigma_{0}, \\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{2},\\\\ldots \\\\right) where each position in the string may take one of the two binary values \\\\sigma_k\\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. The action of the shift operator on this string is :\\\\tau(\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{k+1},\\\\sigma_{k+2},\\\\ldots) = (\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{k-1},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{k+1},\\\\ldots) that is, each lattice position is shifted over by one to the left. The bi-infinite string may be represented by two real numbers 0\\\\le x,y\\\\le 1 as :x(\\\\sigma)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sigma_{-k} 2^{-(k+1)} and :y(\\\\sigma)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sigma_{k+1} 2^{-(k+1)}. In this representation, the shift operator has the form :\\\\tau(x,y)=\\\\left(2x-\\\\left\\\\lfloor 2x\\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\,,\\\\,\\\\frac{y+\\\\left\\\\lfloor 2x\\\\right\\\\rfloor }{2}\\\\right) which can be seen to be the un-folded baker's map given above.

Publication history Created by Keith Giffen, J. M. DeMatteis, and Kevin Maguire, she first appeared in Justice League International #12 (April 1988). Ice is a separate character from Icemaiden, although the two are similar in appearance, group affiliation, and powers. When Icemaiden first appeared, she had blue skin and pointy ears, and was named Sigrid Nansen. When the character joined Justice League International, the comic book creators believed that her real name had never been given but were mistaken; it was revealed in the Global Guardians entry in Who's Who in the DC Universe. After Ice was killed, the original Icemaiden (Sigrid Nansen) joined the Justice League. A backstory revealed that she was the first Icemaiden, who quit the Global Guardians when Tora appeared. A new origin was revealed in Justice League: Generation Lost #12 (2010), written by Judd Winick and art by Fernando Dagnino Guerra. Fictional character biographyOrigin= The princess of an isolated tribe of magic-wielding Norsemen, Tora Olafsdotter has the natural ability to create and manipulate ice. In the Danish graphic novel Superman: A Tale of Five Cities, Superman and Lois Lane visits Oslo and encounter Ice (Isjomfruen), a local superhero, and her sister Ice Flower (Isblomst), in the famous Frogner Park. Revised origin A different origin was presented in Justice League: Generation Lost. It has not been revealed in what respects this story replaces Tora's original history. In the Justice League: Generation Lost story, Tora's parents and brother are Romanifolket, and her grandfather was the head of a small sect of Romanifolket known as the Is Bygd. Tora was trained to stay calm in order to control her metahuman abilities to create and manipulate ice, to ensure that her grandfather (from whom Tora's parents sought to hide their daughter) could not find her and force her to use her power to keep control over the other Bygd residents. Eventually Tora's grandfather tracked his family down and, after seeing her father being beaten, she lost control, causing the death of several, among them her own father.Justice League: Generation Lost #12 (October 2010) It was this event, which she repressed due to the dissociative trauma tied to her accidental patricide, along with the result of the training to stay calm and her father's dying wish that she prevent herself from interacting violently with others that caused Tora's shy personality. =Global Guardians= When an engineer named Rod Schoendienst discovered the ice people, he made a pact with the King that allowed Tora to leave their kingdom. After Rod introduced Tora to Doctor Mist and the Global Guardians she joined the team as the second Icemaiden. Soon after, she became friends with Beatriz DaCosta (aka Green Flame). After the Guardians lost their U.N. funding in the wake of the Justice League's reformation as the Justice League International, Beatriz talked her into walking up to a JLI embassy and asking for a job. Remarkably, in the wake of Black Canary's resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on. =Justice League= Green Flame and Icemaiden Ice's personality is a mix of girl-next- door wholesomeness and innocent-abroad naiveté, which served as a contrast to the impulsive, libidinous traits of her friend and teammate Fire. The two change their names from Green Flame and Icemaiden to Fire and Ice. Ice serves with the Justice League International for years (remaining with the American branch even after a European branch was opened), occasionally dated Green Lantern Guy Gardner, and expresses an open (albeit unrequited) crush on Superman after he joins the team. Ice is present at Superman's death (in Superman #75). She is one of the few Justice Leaguers still standing after Doomsday, Superman's killer, has dispatched the team. Later she returns to her kingdom after being called by her dying father, King Olaf, who wants to make her his successor to the throne of their kingdom when he dies.Justice League America (Vol. 1) #80 However her father passes away during his sleep and is Ice's brother, Ewald, that becomes the successor to the throne,Justice League America (Vol. 1) #81 yet, Ewald's evil intentions become quite clear as he begins to assert control of what is not rightfully his.Justice League America (Vol. 1) #82 As it turns out, Ewald had been in contact with a powerful entity who considered himself a celestial force beyond good and evil, with the purpose to \\"act when judgment has been passed\\"Justice League America (Vo. 1) #83 (later revealed to be the villainous Overmaster, an alien being who destroys worlds he does not find worthy). The JLA set out to rescue Ice and when they reach her kingdom they discover that Ewald's power has increased due to an ancient staff he carries, and he is controlling the people of the kingdom. As they come near to Ewald, they find themselves under attack from ancient Norwegian giants summoned by Ewald to do his bidding.Justice League America (Vol. 1) #84 In the midst of battle Booster Gold's new armour shorts out, leaving both him and Blue Beetle running for cover. Guy and Fire lead the mission to rescue Ice from her brother while the rest of the Leaguers battle the mythic giants summoned by Ewald. One by one, the weapons that the giants hold are destroyed, and this removes the creatures' power as well. A similar tactic is tried on Ewald, causing his staff to overload and explode, killing him. Ice is free to take the throne of her kingdom, but believes the people should choose a leader for themselves – she leaves to rejoin her friends in the Justice League.Justice League America (Vol. 1) #85 Ice eventually falls also under the mental influence of Overmaster. During a JLA confrontation, Ice breaks free of his mental control and is slain by Overmaster. Mark Waid, who wrote those issues, has admitted that the death was a mistake. Before her death, Ice displayed enhanced powers which was revealed to be the result of the battle with her brother. When Ewald's staff exploded, Tora actually absorbed the overload energy into herself. After her death, Guy Gardner smashes his way into her home city to pay his respects. Ice's mother, Queen Olaf, assures Guy that due to the happiness he brought her daughter, he is welcome at any time. Queen Olaf calls him 'son'.Guy Gardner: Warrior #25 (November 1994) =Ghost appearances= Ice has appeared on several occasions since her death. In Showcase '96 #7, Fire and Cruiser are involved in an accident which leaves them cold, tired, and snowbound. They swap their life stories, and as she begins to drift into unconsciousness, which would be fatal following her concussion, Fire sees a vision of her late friend Ice, who helps her decide to live. It is not revealed if Ice was a ghost or a figment of Fire's imagination, but Fire awoke to a warm burning fire and she and Cruiser had traded sitting positions. Ice's spirit once again appears in JLA Annual #2. She and several other deceased JLA members are resurrected by Felix Faust. In the end, she sacrifices herself again to save the JLA from his dark magic, and recites the same final words she spoke when killed by the Overmaster. Either the spirit or an illusion of Ice appeared in I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League, in which she was damned to Hell (or a similar dimension) \\"because of an error somewhere.\\" JLA Classified 07 (2005) Due to a mistake by Booster Gold, he and his friends were lost inside this dimension. The group is soon allowed to leave via walking. In an Orpheus clause, they are told that Ice can join with them if none look back to see her following. Plagued by doubt, Fire looks back once and Ice, if it was her, is lost. It is stated that Ice vanished off to her proper Valhalla. =Resurrection= While on a mission in Azerbaijan, Barbara Gordon's Birds of Prey discover Ice unconscious within a Rocket Red exosuit which they wrest from the possession of an underworld figure, Kerimov. Kerimov has hired the Secret Six to transport the exosuit, and the Birds of Prey and Secret Six would come to blows after Big Barda and Huntress capture it. Kerimov plans to use the resurrection of a goddess to manipulate the Russian people by playing on their superstitions about ice princesses, and to use her great power to make himself a powerful ruler.Birds Of Prey #106 (July 2007) Tora is awakened by Creote, a member of the team and native Russian who addresses her as \\"goddess\\". She is enraged and unleashes her wrath upon both the Birds of Prey and Catman's Secret Six: she seeks to avenge her own murder. Huntress' mention of Guy Gardner, in addition to a hard slap, brings Ice back to her senses, while Deadshot dispatches Kerimov (as her savior, he retained influence over Tora). Ice leaves the country in the company of the Birds of Prey.Birds Of Prey #107 (August 2007) She meets up with Fire at a facility belonging to the United Nations-affiliated intelligence service Checkmate, where they talk about old times and catch up on current ones. Although Ice is in the care of Fire and Checkmate, she has ventured out on occasion, helping Earth's heroes during the Sinestro Corps War. In the aftermath of the war, she decides to ice up Times Square in order to provide temporary fun for local children. There, Guy Gardner surprises her with a public kiss. She quickly rebukes his advances, indicating she needs more time. Guy agrees, then swiftly sets up a date for one month from that point. Later Guy blames Bea for Tora's refusal to accept a cohabitation on Oa. During the \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline, Tora is one of the first metahumans infected by the Anti-Life Equation and turned into a new Justifier. In such role she attacks Checkmate, infecting Beatriz and her collaborators. Under the influence of the Equation, they murder anyone who gets in their way.Final Crisis #1–7 (July 2008 – March 2009) =Blackest Night= In spite of earlier events of the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Tora is described as Guy Gardner's \\"on-off girlfriend\\" and is briefly seen in his arms as the former members of Justice League International visit the grave of Ted Kord.Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) She is one of the heroes who have tried to defend Earth against the universal invasion from the Black Lantern Corps led by the demon lord Nekron. Despite being resurrected, Tora's previous deceased status allows a black power ring from the Black Lantern Corps to transform her into a Black Lantern.Blackest Night #5 (January 2010) Black Lantern Ice attacked her lover Guy in Coast City until she was defeated.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #46 (March 2010) Later, in the final battle, Ice is freed by the power of white light.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) =Generation Lost= Ice appears as one of the central characters in Justice League: Generation Lost, a maxi-series that takes place during the wider \\"Brightest Day\\" storylines. At the start of the series, Ice is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the JLI's founder and Ted Kord's murderer, Maxwell Lord. During an encounter with Max at the Justice League's former New York headquarters, Ice is rendered unconscious alongside Fire, Booster Gold, and Captain Atom. The former Justice League members awake to discover that Lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet, save for those present at the embassy. and the others.Justice League: Generation Lost #1 (May 2010) After trying to talk to Guy and tell him what has transpired, Tora discovers that Max has mentally influenced the world into believing that she had attempted to murder Guy shortly after the events of Blackest Night, thus ruining any credibility she has.Justice League: Generation Lost #2 (May 2010) Ice, Fire and new Rocket Red arrive at a robotics labs only to be confronted by the Metal Men, who are being controlled by Professor Ivo.Justice League: Generation Lost #10 (September 2010) Ice loses control after nearly being beaten to death, causing her costume to become ripped and turning her skin and hair into living ice.Justice League: Generation Lost #11 (October 2010) Ice nearly kills the entire team, but as the repressed memories involving the truth about her origins began unlocking themselves and overwhelming Tora, she began calming down as she remembers her father's dying wish. After Ice returns to normal, she becomes sorrowful when she realizes what she had done. Later, she explains her origin to Fire.Justice League: Generation Lost #15 (December 2010) =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ice is recruited as part of the new U.N.-sponsored Justice League International.Justice League International (vol. 2) #1 (September 2011) She appears to still have some sort of existing relationship with Guy, though it is not expanded upon.Justice League International (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011) Powers and abilities In addition to being a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, Ice can project in various forms quantities of ice and snow through her hands just enough to down an opponent. She can create platforms of ice upon which she can skate. Before her initial demise, she was powered-up mysteriously (later revealed to be the result of the Overmaster). She was able to generate larger amounts of ice and snow, and gained super strength and the ability to fly. After her resurrection in Birds of Prey, Ice's powers seem incredibly destructive, expelling people from the building she's in as she awakens with bright white eyes, and conjuring a massive icy figure before her as well as controlling the weather to some degree, by causing the beginning of a blizzard far stronger than those known in that area. Other versions In Tangent Comics (taking place on Earth-96 of the Old Multiverse and Earth-9 of the New Multiverse) Ice is a female supervillain with cryo-kinetic powers and is a member of the Fatal Five. In other mediaTelevision= Ice as seen in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. * Ice and Fire have both made several appearances in the Justice League Unlimited animated series, though only Fire had speaking roles. Fire and Ice are often seen together in the animated series, as is the case in the comics. Ice's costume is a leotard with an iceberg insignia on the chest and she sports short, white hair. * Ice appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Darkseid Descending!\\", voiced by Jennifer Hale in a Scandinavian accent. She appears as a member of Batman's new Justice League, along with her friend Fire. This version of Ice is portrayed as being ditzy, with a strange mistrust for Greeks, whom she mistakes the New Gods of Apokolips for. In a reversed deviation from the comics, Booster Gold flirts with Ice while Guy Gardner initially flirts with Fire. She reappears as a member of the Justice League in the episodes \\"Shadow of the Bat!\\", \\"Time Out For Vengeance!\\", and \\"Powerless!\\" In \\"Time Out For Vengeance!\\", Guy does begin hitting on Tora, mirroring their relationship in the comics. In \\"Shadow of the Bat!\\", she reveals to Fire that she has a crush on Aquaman because she loves the smell of fish. * Ice appears in Mad where she tries to appeal to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends\\". * Clare Grant voiced Ice in the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special. She appears outside the museum at the time when Mr. Freeze, Captain Cold, Icicle II, and one of the Chillblaines were each planning to steal the Blue Star of Egypt. Before Ice can take on the villains, the museum collapses due to the ice villains having demolished some load-bearing walls. * Ice appears in Young Justice: Outsiders. =Films= * Ice starred in the 1997 live action television pilot Justice League of America played by Kimberly Oja. In this version she was a meteorologist named Tori (instead of Tora) Olafsdotter, was American instead of Norwegian, and gained her powers from exposure to the villain's weather-control machine. She also began a relationship with the Atom rather than the Green Lantern. * Ice is portrayed by Chloe Dykstra in the 2011 short film The Death and Return of Superman. * In Batman and Harley Quinn, one of the waitresses in the restaurant Harley Quinn worked for a time makes a cameo, wearing an exotic version of Ice's costume. =Video games= Ice appears as a non-player character in DC Universe Online. =Merchandise= * At Toy Fair 2007, Mattel announced Fire and Ice action figures would be released as part of the Justice League Unlimited line. * DC Direct will be releasing a line of Justice League International figures designed by Kevin Maguire. Ice will be included in that set, wearing her Global Guardians costume, which is what she wore during Maguire's run on the title.

It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained by pricking the skin with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L. Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia. History Leland Clark presented his first paper about the oxygen electrode, later named the Clark electrode, on 15 April 1956, at a meeting of the American Society for Artificial Organs during the annual meetings of the Federated Societies for Experimental Biology.Advances in Electrochemical Sciences and Engineering : Bioelectrochemistry : Fundamentals, Applications and Recent Developments. Somerset, NJ, US: John Wiley & Sons, 2013.Lipkowski, J., Kolb, D. M., & Alkire, R. C. (2011). Bioelectrochemistry : Fundamentals, Applications and Recent Developments. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH. In 1962, Clark and Ann Lyons from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital developed the first glucose enzyme electrode. This biosensor was based on a thin layer of glucose oxidase (GOx) on an oxygen electrode. Thus, the readout was the amount of oxygen consumed by GOx during the enzymatic reaction with the substrate glucose. This publication became one of the most often cited papers in life sciences. Due to this work he is considered the “father of biosensors,” especially with respect to the glucose sensing for diabetes patients.Advances in Electrochemical Sciences and Engineering : Bioelectrochemistry : Fundamentals, Applications and Recent Developments. Somerset, NJ, US: John Wiley & Sons, 2013.Lipkowski, J., Kolb, D. M., & Alkire, R. C. (2011). Bioelectrochemistry : Fundamentals, Applications and Recent Developments. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH. CDC image showing the usage of a lancet and a blood glucose meter Another early glucose meter was the Ames Reflectance Meter by Anton H. Clemens. It was used in American hospitals in the 1970s. A moving needle indicated the blood glucose after about a minute. Home glucose monitoring was demonstrated to improve glycemic control of type 1 diabetes in the late 1970s, and the first meters were marketed for home use around 1981. The two models initially dominant in North America in the 1980s were the Glucometer, introduced in November 1981,\\"Portable Meter To Aid Diabetics\\", Pittsburgh Press, November 5, 1981, p. A-6 whose trademark is owned by Bayer, and the Accu-Chek meter (by Roche). Consequently, these brand names have become synonymous with the generic product to many health care professionals. In Britain, a health care professional or a patient may refer to \\"taking a BM\\": \\"Mrs X's BM is 5\\", etc. BM stands for Boehringer Mannheim, now part of Roche, who produce test strips called 'BM-test' for use in a meter. In North America, hospitals resisted adoption of meter glucose measurements for inpatient diabetes care for over a decade. Managers of laboratories argued that the superior accuracy of a laboratory glucose measurement outweighed the advantage of immediate availability and made meter glucose measurements unacceptable for inpatient diabetes management. Patients with diabetes and their endocrinologists eventually persuaded acceptance. Some health care policymakers still resist the idea that the society would be well advised to pay the consumables (reagents, lancets, etc.) needed. Home glucose testing was adopted for type 2 diabetes more slowly than for type 1, and a large proportion of people with type 2 diabetes have never been instructed in home glucose testing. This has mainly come about because health authorities are reluctant to bear the cost of the test strips and lancets. =Non-meter test strips= Test strips that changed color and could be read visually, without a meter, have been widely used since the 1980s. They had the added advantage that they could be cut longitudinally to save money. Critics argued that test strips read by eye are not as accurate or convenient as meter testing. The manufacturer cited studies that show the product is just as effective despite not giving an answer to one decimal place, something they argue is unnecessary for control of blood sugar. This debate also happened in Germany where \\"Glucoflex-R\\" was an established strip for type 2 diabetes. As meter accuracy and insurance coverage improved, they lost popularity. \\"Glucoflex-R\\" is Australia manufacturer National Diagnostic Products alternative to the BM test strip. It has versions that can be used either in a meter or read visually. It is also marketed under the brand name Betachek. On May 1, 2009, the UK distributor Ambe Medical Group reduced the price of their \\"Glucoflex-R\\" test strip to the NHS, by approximately 50%. This was expected to allow the NHS to save money on strips and perhaps loosen the restrictions on supply a little. Another low cost visually read strip is soon to be available on prescription according to sources at the NHS. Types of metersHospital glucose meters= Special glucose meters for multi-patient hospital use are now used. These provide more elaborate quality control records. Their data handling capabilities are designed to transfer glucose results into electronic medical records and the laboratory computer systems for billing purposes. =Blood testing with meters using test strips= Illustration depicting glucose monitoring with glucometer Illustration depicting glucose meter and test strips There are several key characteristics of glucose meters which may differ from model to model: * Size: The average size is now approximately the size of the palm of the hand, although hospital meters can be the size of a remote control. They are battery-powered. * Test strips: A consumable element containing chemicals that react with glucose in the drop of blood is used for each measurement. For some models this element is a plastic test strip with a small spot impregnated with glucose oxidase and other components. Each strip is used once and then discarded. Instead of strips, some models use discs, drums, or cartridges that contain the consumable material for multiple tests. :* Coding: Since test strips may vary from batch to batch, some models require the user to manually enter in a code found on the vial of test strips or on a chip that comes with the test strip. By entering the coding or chip into the glucose meter, the meter will be calibrated to that batch of test strips. However, if this process is carried out incorrectly, the meter reading can be up to 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL) inaccurate. The implications of an incorrectly coded meter can be serious for patients actively managing their diabetes. This may place patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia. Alternatively, some test strips contain the code information in the strip; others have a microchip in the vial of strips that can be inserted into the meter. These last two methods reduce the possibility of user error. One Touch has standardized their test strips around a single code number, so that, once set, there is no need to further change the code in their older meters, and in some of their newer meters, there is no way to change the code. * Volume of blood sample: The size of the drop of blood needed by different models varies from 0.3 to 1 μl. (Older models required larger blood samples, usually defined as a \\"hanging drop\\" from the fingertip.) Smaller volume requirements reduce the frequency of unproductive pricks. * Alternate site testing: Smaller drop volumes have enabled \\"alternate site testing\\" – pricking the forearms or other less sensitive areas instead of the fingertips. This type of testing should only be used when blood glucose levels are stable, such as when before meals, when fasting, or just before going to sleep. * Testing times: The times it takes to read a test strip may range from 3 to 60 seconds for different models. * Display: The glucose value in mg/dl or mmol/l is displayed on a digital display. The preferred measurement unit varies by country: mg/dl are preferred in the US, France, Japan, Israel, and India. mmol/l are used in Canada, Australia and China. Germany is the only country where medical professionals routinely operate in both units of measure. (To convert mmol/l to mg/dl, multiply by 18. To convert mg/dl to mmol/l, divide by 18.) Many meters can display either unit of measure; there have been a couple of published instances in which someone with diabetes has been misled into the wrong action by assuming that a reading in mmol/l was really a very low reading in mg/dl, or the converse. In general, if a value is presented with a decimal point, it is in mmol/l, without a decimal it is most likely mg/dl. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" align=center width=\\"600\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"background:powderblue;\\"  - !

This is important because home blood glucose meters measure the glucose in whole blood while most lab tests measure the glucose in plasma. Currently, there are many meters on the market that give results as \\"plasma equivalent,\\" even though they are measuring whole blood glucose. The plasma equivalent is calculated from the whole blood glucose reading using an equation built into the glucose meter. This allows patients to easily compare their glucose measurements in a lab test and at home. It is important for patients and their health care providers to know whether the meter gives its results as \\"whole blood equivalent\\" or \\"plasma equivalent.\\" One model measures beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood to detect ketosis for measuring both unhealthy ketoacidosis and healthy nutritional ketosis. * Clock/memory: Most meters now include a clock that is set by the user for date and time and a memory for past test results. The memory is an important aspect of diabetes care, as it enables the person with diabetes to keep a record of management and look for trends and patterns in blood glucose levels over days and weeks. Most memory chips can display an average of recent glucose readings. A known deficiency of all current meters is that the clock is often not set to the correct time (i.e., due to time changes, static electricity, etc.) and therefore has the potential to misrepresent the time of the past test results making pattern management difficult. :* Data transfer: Many meters now have more sophisticated data handling capabilities. Many can be downloaded by a cable or infrared to a computer that has diabetes management software to display the test results. Some meters allow entry of additional data throughout the day, such as insulin dose, amounts of carbohydrates eaten, or exercise. A number of meters have been combined with other devices, such as insulin injection devices, PDAs, cellular transmitters, and Game Boys. A radio link to an insulin pump allows automatic transfer of glucose readings to a calculator that assists the wearer in deciding on an appropriate insulin dose. Cost The cost of home blood glucose monitoring can be substantial due to the cost of the test strips. In 2006, the consumer cost of each glucose strip ranged from about $0.35 to $1.00. Manufacturers often provide meters at no cost to induce use of the profitable test strips. Type 1 diabetics may test as often as 4 to 10 times a day due to the dynamics of insulin adjustment, whereas type 2 typically test less frequently, especially when insulin is not part of treatment. A recent study on the comparative cost-effectiveness of all options for the self-monitoring of blood glucose funded by the National Health Service in the UK uncovered considerable variation in the price paid, which could not be explained by the availability of advanced meter features. It estimated that a total of £12 m was invested in providing 42 million self- monitoring of blood glucose tests with systems that fail to meet acceptable accuracy standards, and efficiency savings of £23.2 m per annum are achievable if the National Health Service were to disinvest from technologies providing lesser functionality than available alternatives, but at a much higher price. Batches of counterfeit test strips for some meters have been identified, which have been shown to produce inaccurate results. =Noninvasive meters= The search for a successful technique began about 1975 and has continued to the present without a clinically or commercially viable product.The Pursuit of Noninvasive Glucose, 3rd Edition, by John L. Smith, Ph.D., available at http://www.mendosa.com/The%20Pursuit%20of%20Noninvasive%20Glucose%203rd%20Edition.pdf. , only one such product had ever been approved for sale by the FDA, based on a technique for electrically pulling glucose through intact skin, and it was withdrawn after a short time owing to poor performance and occasional damage to the skin of users. =Continuous glucose monitors= Continuous glucose monitor. The sensor and transmitter are fixed to the upper arm. The reader shows days to replacement of sensor, current blood glucose level and a diagram of the latest blood glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitor systems can consist of a disposable sensor placed under the skin, a transmitter connected to the sensor and a reader that receives and displays the measurements. The sensor can be used for several days before it needs to be replaced. The devices provide real-time measurements, and reduce the need for fingerprick testing of glucose levels. A drawback is that the meters are not as accurate because they read the glucose levels in the interstitial fluid which lags behind the levels in the blood. An example of a CGM Accuracy Accuracy of glucose meters is a common topic of clinical concern. Blood glucose meters must meet accuracy standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). According to ISO 15197 Blood glucose meters must provide results that are within ±15% of a laboratory standard for concentrations above 100 mg/dL or within ±15 mg/dL for concentrations below 100 mg/dL at least 95% of the time. However, a variety of factors can affect the accuracy of a test. Factors affecting accuracy of various meters include calibration of meter, ambient temperature, pressure use to wipe off strip (if applicable), size and quality of blood sample, high levels of certain substances (such as ascorbic acid) in blood, hematocrit, dirt on meter, humidity, and aging of test strips. Models vary in their susceptibility to these factors and in their ability to prevent or warn of inaccurate results with error messages. The Clarke Error Grid has been a common way of analyzing and displaying accuracy of readings related to management consequences. More recently an improved version of the Clarke Error Grid has come into use: It is known as the Consensus Error Grid. Older blood glucose meters often need to be \\"coded\\" with the lot of test strips used, otherwise, the accuracy of the blood glucose meter may be compromised due to lack of calibration. Future One noninvasive glucose meter has been approved by the U.S. FDA: The GlucoWatch G2 Biographer made by Cygnus Inc. The device was designed to be worn on the wrist and used electric fields to draw out body fluid for testing. The device did not replace conventional blood glucose monitoring. One limitation was that the GlucoWatch was not able to cope with perspiration at the measurement site. Sweat must be allowed to dry before measurement can resume. Due to this limitation and others, the product is no longer on the market. The market introduction of noninvasive blood glucose measurement by spectroscopic measurement methods, in the field of near-infrared (NIR), by extracorporal measuring devices, has not been successful because the devices measure tissue sugar in body tissues and not the blood sugar in blood fluid. To determine blood glucose, the measuring beam of infrared light, for example, has to penetrate the tissue for measurement of blood glucose. There are currently three CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) available. The first is Medtronic's Minimed Paradigm RTS with a sub-cutaneous probe attached to a small transmitter (roughly the size of a quarter) that sends interstitial glucose levels to a small pager sized receiver every five minutes. The Dexcom System is another system, available in two different generations in the US, the G4 and the G5. (1Q 2016). It is a hypodermic probe with a small transmitter. The receiver is about the size of a cell phone and can operate up to twenty feet from the transmitter. The Dexcom G4 transmits via radio frequency and requires a dedicated receiver. The G5 version utilizes Bluetooth low energy for data transmission, and can transmit data directly to a compatible cellular telephone. Currently, only Apple's iPhone can be used as a receiver, but Dexcom is in the process of getting an Android version approved, and anticipates availability in the second half of 2016. Aside from a two-hour calibration period, monitoring is logged at five-minute intervals for up to 1 week. The user can set the high and low glucose alarms. The third CGMS available is the FreeStyle Navigator from Abbott Laboratories. There is currently an effort to develop an integrated treatment system with a glucose meter, insulin pump, and wristop controller, as well as an effort to integrate the glucose meter and a cell phone. These glucose meter/cellular phone combinations are under testing and currently cost US$149 retail. Testing strips are proprietary and available only through the manufacturer (no insurance availability). These \\"Glugophones\\" are currently offered in three forms: as a dongle for the iPhone, an add-on pack for LG model UX5000, VX5200, and LX350 cell phones, as well as an add-on pack for the Motorola Razr cell phone. In US, this limits providers to AT&T; and Verizon. Similar systems have been tested for a longer time in Finland. Recent advances in cellular data communications technology have enabled the development of glucose meters that directly integrate cellular data transmission capability, enabling the user to both transmit glucose data to the medical caregiver and receive direct guidance from the caregiver on the screen of the glucose meter. The first such device, from Telcare, Inc., was exhibited at the 2010 CTIA International Wireless Expo, where it won an E-Tech award. This device then underwent clinical testing in the US and internationally. In early 2014 Google reported testing prototypes of contact lenses that monitor glucose levels and alert users when glucose levels cross certain thresholds. Technology Two used Accu-Chek test strips. The lower one has had the cover peeled off to show the circuit. Many glucose meters employ the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone catalyzed by glucose oxidase (sometimes known as GOx). Others use a similar reaction catalysed instead by another enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). This has the advantage of sensitivity over glucose oxidase but is more susceptible to interfering reactions with other substances. The first- generation devices relied on the same colorimetric reaction that is still used nowadays in glucose test strips for urine. Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently. Most glucometers today use an electrochemical method. Test strips contain a capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose in the blood reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. The total charge passing through the electrode is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample. The same principle is used in test strips that have been commercialized for the detection of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). These test strips use a beta-hydroxybutyrate-dehydrogenase enzyme instead of a glucose oxidizing enzyme and have been used to detect and help treat some of the complications that can result from prolonged hyperglycemia. Blood alcohol sensors using the same approach, but with alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, have been tried and patented but have not yet been successfully commercially developed. Meter use for hypoglycemia Although the apparent value of immediate measurement of blood glucose might seem to be higher for hypoglycemia than hyperglycemia, meters have been less useful. The primary problems are precision and ratio of false positive and negative results. An imprecision of ±15% is less of a problem for high glucose levels than low. There is little difference in the management of a glucose of 200 mg/dl compared with 260 (i.e., a \\"true\\" glucose of 230±15%), but a ±15% error margin at a low glucose concentration brings greater ambiguity with regards to glucose management. The imprecision is compounded by the relative likelihoods of false positives and negatives in populations with diabetes and those without. People with type 1 diabetes usually have a wider range of glucose levels, and glucose peaks above normal, often ranging from 40 to 500 mg/dl (2.2 to 28 mmol/l), and when a meter reading of 50 or 70 (2.8 or 3.9 mmol/l) is accompanied by their usual hypoglycemic symptoms, there is little uncertainty about the reading representing a \\"true positive\\" and little harm done if it is a \\"false positive.\\" However, the incidence of hypoglycemia unawareness, hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and faulty counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia make the need for greater reliability at low levels particularly urgent in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, while this is seldom an issue in the more common form of the disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast, people who do not have diabetes may periodically have hypoglycemic symptoms but may also have a much higher rate of false positives to true, and a meter is not accurate enough to base a diagnosis of hypoglycemia upon. A meter can occasionally be useful in the monitoring of severe types of hypoglycemia (e.g., congenital hyperinsulinism) to ensure that the average glucose when fasting remains above 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l).

In a sequential digital logic circuit, data is stored in memory devices called flip-flops or latches. The output of a flip-flop is constant until a pulse is applied to its \\"clock\\" input, upon which the input of the flip-flop is latched into its output. In a synchronous logic circuit, an electronic oscillator called the clock generates a string of pulses, the \\"clock signal\\". This clock signal is applied to every storage element, so in an ideal synchronous circuit, every change in the logical levels of its storage components is simultaneous. Ideally, the input to each storage element has reached its final value before the next clock occurs, so the behaviour of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly. Practically, some delay is required for each logical operation, resulting in a maximum speed at which each synchronous system can run. To make these circuits work correctly, a great deal of care is needed in the design of the clock distribution networks. Static timing analysis is often used to determine the maximum safe operating speed. Nearly all digital circuits, and in particular nearly all CPUs, are fully synchronous circuits with a global clock.

All were written during 1918 to 1920 and published simultaneously by Constable (London) and Brentano's (New York) in 1921. They were first performed in 1922 by the New York Theatre Guild at the old Garrick Theatre in New York CityWalter Prichard Eaton, The Theatre Guild, the First Ten Years, Brentano's, New York, 1929, p. 248. and, in Britain, at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1923.Holroyd, Michael, Bernard Shaw: The One-Volume Definitive Edition, p. 510\\\\. (Random House, 1997). SynopsisPreface= In the preface, Shaw speaks of the pervasive discouragement and poverty in Europe after World War I, and relates these issues to inept government. Simple primitive societies, he says, were easily governable while the civilized societies of the twentieth century are so complex that learning to govern them properly can't be accomplished within the human lifespan: People with experience enough to serve the purpose fall into senility and die. Shaw's solution is enhanced longevity: we must learn to live much longer; a centenarian should be less than middle aged. (Shaw was in his mid-60s when the plays were written). This change, Shaw predicts, will happen through Creative Evolution (evolutionary change that occurs because it is needed or wanted--the Lamarckian view-- and not as a result of natural selection--Darwinism) as influenced by the Life Force (l'élan vital).The Oxford English Dictionary: élan vital: [Fr. (H. Bergson L’Évolution créatrice (1907) Chap. iii, p. 276); see élan.] In the philosophy of Henri Bergson (1859–1941), a vital impulse or life force, of which we are aware intuitively; spec., an original impetus of life supposed to have brought about the variations which during the course of evolution produced new species; a creative principle found in all living beings. Hence gen., any mysterious vital principle. Neither Creative Evolution nor the Life Force were Shavian inventions. Shaw says they are his names for what the churches have called Providence and scientists call Functional Adaptation and Natural Selection (among other names) and gives due credit to Henri Bergson's élan vital.Shaw, Bernard. Sixteen Self Sketches: What is My Religious Faith, pp. 72–79, (Constable & Co., London, 1949. Nevertheless, he uses both terms in Man and Superman which was written nine years before Bergson's work was published.Bergson, Henri. Creative Evolution, translated by Arthur Mitchell, Ph.D. New York: Henry Holt and Company (1911). These concepts had some currency among Shaw's contemporaries, and the Methuselah plays are based on Shaw's extrapolations from the two principles. Although both ideas are out of scientific favour as the twenty-first century begins, Shaw accepted them completely (See Commentary, below.) Shaw also advocates what he calls homeopathy as a pedagogical method, arguing that society \\"can only be lamed and enslaved by\\" education. Shaw's \\"homeopathic\\" educational method consisted of lying to students, until the students were able to see through the lies and argue with the teachers. =In the Beginning: B.C. 4004= In the Beginning: B.C. 4004 is allegorical. Adam and Eve, as avatars for aboriginal humanity, discover a fawn dead from a broken neck and realize they, too, will die eventually from some mishap, even though they are immune to aging. Their dread of death is overwhelmed by the yet more dreadful prospect of life unending, with its tedium and burdens, but they feel bound to live forever because Eden must be taken care of and they are the only ones available to do it. The Serpent--spoken of in Genesis.King James Bible. Genesis:1–30.The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text (The Jewish Publication Society translation,1917). Tanakh/Torah/Bereishit 3:1–15 .--offers a solution: Lilith, who came before them, and was, in fact, their mother, made them male and female, so they have the ability to reproduce. If they learn to propagate they can make other humans to tend the garden and thus be free to escape from living when they wish. Discovering the possibility of death suggests possibilities for other changes and a discussion follows that deals progressively with loneliness and love, uncertainty and fear, fidelity and marriage and the courage found in laughter. At the end the Serpent whispers-- for Eve's ears alone--the secret of reproduction, which Eve hears with greatly mixed emotions. A few centuries slip by; Eve and Adam have aged a bit, but otherwise have changed but little: She spends her time by spinning flax for weaving, he digs in the garden. Their son Cain arrives, boastful and aggressive, proud to have invented murder by killing his brother Abel. He is now a warrior who also kills beasts for food. He is utterly disdainful of the simple farming life and soon rudely goes away. Eve thoughtfully remarks that there is more to living than killing or digging in the garden and says her future sons will find things more wonderful to do. =The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas: Present Day= The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas is intended to teach an audience what readers of the Preface are assumed to have learned. Two brothers, one a retired, but influential cleric (Franklyn) and the other a biologist of note (Conrad), independently conclude that humans must increase their lifespans to three centuries in order to acquire the wisdom and experience needed to make complex civilizations functional. Conrad has published their conclusions in a book. A housemaid announces the opportune arrival of Lubin and Burge, two prominent politicians with antagonistic viewpoints; they will serve as sounding-boards while the brothers present their case for the need of longer lifetimes. Members of the younger generation, in the persons of Franklyn's daughter Savvy and her sweetheart, a young cleric named Haslam, are at the presentation, too. Both politicians seize upon the promise of enhanced longevity as a way of attracting votes. One of them is cynical, not believing longevity will happen, but the other deems the theory valid, yet rejects the prospect out of hand because longer lives will be available to everyone instead of only the elite. Savvy and Haslam are nearly unaffected because the entire idea is well above their heads. The brothers are disappointed but remain completely confident that the change is sure to happen. Except for the brothers, only the housemaid is greatly influenced by the prospect of longevity, for she turns out to be the only one who has really read Conrad's book. [Shaw wrote an extra scene for this part, which he later deleted and then published separately as A Glimpse of the Domesticity of Franklyn Barnabas] =The Thing Happens: A.D. 2170= The Thing Happens begins in 2170, 150 years after the Barnabas brothers disclosed their inferences, Englishmen continue immature throughout their lives. As a result, governmental dignities are mere figureheads, useful only for formalities and ceremonial occasions. The hard work of government is carried out by hired consultants from Africa and China unless competent Scots, Irishmen or Welshmen chance to be available. (The foreigners live no longer than the English, but they mature early.) The first scene opens with England's President, Burge- Lubin (descendant and composite of the politicians seen in The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas) squabbling with a Barnabas descendant--via telephones equipped with television--about which of them should welcome a visiting American who has invented a method for breathing underwater. Barnabas goes to meet the American inventor, who wants to use Records Office film footage to create a promotional cinema showing sundry important Britons who have lost their lives by drowning, but who, with the invention's help, might not have perished. Burge-Lubin summons Confucius, the Chief Secretary, to brief him on governmental matters. Confucius--nominally a consultant from China-- is, de facto, the head of government. After their conversation, Burge-Lubin suggests a game of marine golf, but Confucius refuses on the ground that he is too mature to enjoy playing games. Burge-Lubin excuses himself, saying he must confer privately with the Minister of Health. The Minister of Health is a beautiful Black African woman, and the Presidential conference turns out to be a dalliance via long-distance videophone. She enjoys the flirting, but rejects a rendezvous and breaks the connection. Burge-Lubin is chiding himself indulgently for mixing romance with business when Barnabas bursts in, completely overwhelmed. He reveals that the drowned notables in the film clips at the Records Office are all the same person whose multiple demises had ended several significant careers. Moreover, he has recognized the person as the currently alive and active Archbishop of York. Burge-Lubin considers that impossible and calls Barnabas mad. Meanwhile, the Archbishop, having learned of the furore at the Records Office, presents himself for questioning. The Archbishop is recognizably the Reverend Haslam, Savvy Barnabas' sweetheart, no longer callow, but dignified and confident and looking no more than fifty. He readily admits repeatedly feigning death and explains that the laws enforcing mandatory retirement at a certain age and those controlling eligibility for pensions left him with no alternative: When his record showed him old enough to be retired, he could no longer keep his job but he was always denied a pension because he looked too young. His solution was to fake his death and, as a different person, begin a new career. Barnabas hotly contested the legality of this and favoured prosecuting. Burge-Lubin, realising that he, or anyone else, might turn out to be long-lived, counsels moderation. The discussion is interrupted by the arrival of the Domestic Minister, Mrs Lutestring to give her mandatory quarterly report. Both Burge-Lubin and Barnabas are considerably put off because they stand in awe of her although they deem her quite good-looking. She learns of the Archbishop's longevity with great interest but no evident surprise and it soon emerges that she, also, is long lived and remembers Archbishop Haslam from the time she was parlour maid for Franklyn Barnabas. After the briefest sort of conversation, the pair leaves together, obviously intending to produce some long-lived children. Consternation reigns behind them because the others realise than, with the secret out, other long-lifers, previously in hiding, will emerge to join them and form a colony that will seem a threat to short-lived people. However, counter-measures are not taken because it is realised that any one of them may be long-lived too, but not yet aware of it. At that point the Minister of Health phones again to tell Burge-Lubin she has changed her mind and invites him to share an amorous adventure aboard her yacht, presently in Fishguard Bay. He is to take an aeroplane to the location and be dropped near the yacht by parachute. She will fish him out and dry him off and then let nature take its course. She is outraged when Burge-Lubin declines the offer. The reason for his doing so, as he tells Confucius, is that he doesn't wish to risk contracting rheumatism from exposure to the cold waters of the bay, since he might have to live 300 years, rheumatic. Confucius congratulates him on having reached the first stage of maturity. =Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman: A.D. 3000= The Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman begins in 3000 AD, on the south shore of Galway Bay where an old man is found sitting on an ancient stone bollard, once used as a mooring for ships. His face is buried in his hands and he is sobbing. A woman approaches to ask if he needs help. He says no and tries to hide his tears, which he attributes to hay fever. She asks if he is a foreigner and he denies it and says he is a Briton who lives in the capital. \\"Baghdad?\\" she inquires and he says \\"Yes,\\" adding that he is touring these islands for sentimental reasons because, in ancient times, they were the centre of the British Commonwealth. Both are speaking English, but their cultural backgrounds are so different that communication is not easy. She, being long lived understands no metaphors and speaks the literal truth, while he consistently uses figures of speech instead of stating simple facts. She belongs to a colony of long-lived people and has been assigned the task of protecting short-lived visitors. Her concern is that the old man's tears are a sign that he is suffering from discouragement, a dire sickness contracted by short-livers when they talk to long-livers over sixty. Youthful nurses are provided to tourists to keep that from happening but he has evaded Zozim, the one assigned to him. He lapses into tears and she puts in a call for help, saying she has encountered an unattended short-liver who is disoriented. While awaiting help, she asks how he obtained admission to the island, since ordinary tourists are routinely turned away. He says he is with the Prime Minister, who is married to his daughter and with General Aufsteig, who is really the Emperor of Turania, travelling incognito. They have come to consult the oracle about matters of utmost importance. Zozim catches up, recuses himself as overly mature, and asks to be replaced by someone younger. Zoo is the replacement. She is a mere girl of fifty-six and looks more like nineteen to the Elderly Gentleman, who is approaching seventy. They can converse--with difficulty--and have a long discussion that reveals the advantages of long living. Their conversation ends only when it comes time to consult the oracle. The Emperor of Turania, calling himself Napoleon, impatient of ceremony, bursts into the courtyard of the Temple of the Oracle and. He encounters a veiled woman and demands direction to the oracle. She says she is the oracle, but he has contempt for women and insists he be directed to one of the older and more able men. She tells him he would die of discouragement if he talked to elders, male or female--even with her, conversation would be dangerous if she were not veiled and robed with insulating material. He defiantly dares her to remove her veil and robe. When she merely lifts her veil he shrieks that he is dying, covers his eyes, and begs her to veil herself again. She does so and asks if he still wants to consult an older person. No longer arrogant, he asks her for advice. He says he is the world's foremost general, invincible in battle, and adored by all his followers, although his victories cost great carnage. He is at his zenith now but realizes a time will come when the people will rebel and he will become the casualty. His question: \\"How am I to satisfy my genius for fighting until I die?\\" The Oracle thinks the answer simple: \\"Die now, before the tide of glory turns.\\" she says, and fires at him with a pistol he has conveniently provided. He shrieks and falls, but rises once again, because The Oracle missed her target. He rushes from the courtyard, blowing a whistle to summon the police, but is immobilized, within a force-field, near a monument of Falstaff, where he will stand and gibber until it is convenient to collect him. Zozim and Zoo, dressed impressively in costumes that they disparage as foolish, but are demanded by their short-lived clients, lead the visiting party into the temple. It, too, is most impressive with a show of eerie lighting in a measureless abyss. Zozim belittles that display, as well, but the visitors are overawed and become unnerved completely when the oracle appears as an insubstantial figure amidst lightnings and thunder. The Prime Minister, now called The Envoy, is too overwhelmed to ask his question until he swallows a half-pint of brandy. Thus emboldened, he grandiosely speaks of the greatness of his party, the Potterbills, presently in power, but also losing ground to the villainous opposition party, the Rotterjacks. Ultimately he is asking if it would be expedient to hold elections now or better to put them off till spring. He begs the oracle to respond in the same way she did to his illustrious predecessor, Sir Fuller Eastwind. And that request was granted: \\"Go home, poor fool.\\" the oracle replies-- repeating what she had said to Eastwind. Whereupon she vanishes, the lighting turns to daylight and the abyss is no more. Zoo removes and folds her costume--the magic and mystery are gone. The answer they had expected was the one Sir Eastwind had reported: \\"When Britain was cradled in the west, the eastwind hardened her and made her great. Whilst the east wind prevails Britain shall prosper. The eastwind shall wither Britain's enemies in the day of contest. Let the Rotterjacks look to it.\\" Sheer fabrication, but so pleasing to the voters that he stayed in power for another fifteen years. The Prime Minister's choice was clear. All he had to do was tell the public that the oracle had told him exactly what she told his predecessor and let the public believe it was what Sir Eastwind had reported. All present could attest to the truth of that, with no need for lying! That is too much for the Elderly Gentleman to swallow. He leaves the group and seeks out the Oracle, begs her to let him stay on the island, says he will die of disgust and despair if he goes back home. The Oracle tells him that he will die of discouragement if he stays behind. He says he'll take that chance, since it is more honourable. She agrees to let him stay and grasps his hands and looks at him, He rises, stiffens, and falls dead. \\"Poor short-lived thing!\\" she says, \\"What else could I do for you?\\" =As Far as Thought Can Reach: A.D. 31,920= As Far as Thought Can Reach is in a time when short- lived people are a mere footnote in ancient history, and great longevity is the norm. The opening scene is a sunlit glade at the foot of thickly wooded hill, on a warm summer afternoon in 31,920 AD. On the west side stands a little classic temple and in the middle of the glade there is a marble altar, shaped like a table, and long enough for a man to lie on. Rows of curved marble benches, spaced well apart, fan out from the altar. A path with stairs of rough-cut stone leads upward from the temple to the hill. In the glade, a group of youths and maidens, all appearing to be eighteen or older are dancing gracefully to music played on flutes. As they dance, a stranger, physically in the prime of life but with a wrinkled, timeworn face, comes down the stony stairs, rapt in contemplation, and bumps heedlessly into a pair of dancers. He is an \\"Ancient\\". Remonstrances ensue and the Ancient apologizes, saying that had he known there was a nursery here, he should have gone another way. However, after a swift reconciliation, he is invited to join the festivities. The Ancient refuses, saying he is too mature for gambolling; ancients must stick to their own ways of enjoyment. He leaves and the children pledge to stay forever young, but Chloe, somewhat older, says she feels drawn toward the ancient's way of life. She is nearly four years old and is wearying of the activities of children. This leads to a rift with two-year-old Stephen, her romantic partner, but she doesn't mind because it frees her to seek solitude, where she can meditate. Acís, a three-year-old, tries unsuccessfully to comfort him, but Stephen insists on remaining disconsolate until he finds another partner. It will be a busy day at the nursery: a birth is scheduled followed by the Festival of the Artists. A She-Ancient arrives to supervise the birthing. She asks if the child is ready to be born and Acis says the child is more than ready, that she has been shouting and kicking inside her egg and refuses to wait quietly. The birthing proceeds: In procession, youths carry a new tunic, ewers of water, big sponges and, finally a huge egg, which is placed upon the altar. The egg keeps shouting \\"I want to be born! I want to be born!\\" and internal kicking rocks it so hard that it must be held steady to keep it from rolling off the altar. The Ancient deftly opens the shell using a pair of saws and reveals a pretty girl, looking fresh and rosy, but with strands of spare albumen clinging to her body. She looks seventeen years old. The other children bathe her, despite her shrieks and protestations. Her fury turns to delight with the beauty of her tunic when they dress her. She takes a few uncertain steps, but quickly learns to walk, then the Ancient names her Amaryllis, as requested by the other children. The Ancient examines the newly born carefully and pronounces her fit to live. The other children are jubilant because defective children are painlessly destroyed. She, however, will live until she has a fatal accident, which, by the laws of chance, is inevitable for everyone. The Ancient leaves the children to their play. Amaryllis provides amusing interludes throughout the remainder of the play. The Festival of the Artists begins. Their two greatest sculptors will show their latest masterpieces and be crowned with flowers, honoured with dithyrambs and have dances done around them. The sculptors, Arjillax and Martellus, arrive. Martellus apparently brought nothing and Arjillax is jeered because he brought busts of ancients, which the children think are ugly; they want youthful beauties, like themselves. Arjillax explains that he intends to place images in the temple that range in age from the newly-born to the full glory of maturity. Martellus laughs, but not in mockery; he says he, too, attempted such a project, but has smashed all his sculptures and thrown away his tools. Asked why, he says life alone is true and meaningful and that marble remains marble, no matter how skilfully it is shaped. Instead of sculptures, he has brought a scientist, Pygmalion, who is a greater artist than the world has seen before. Pygmalion has successfully created a pair of living, artificial human beings and is ready to display them, which he does, to an audience made impatient by his incomprehensible scientific explanations. The creations are a man and woman, noble in appearance, beautiful to look at and splendidly attired. Arriving hand in hand, they are gratified by the attention they receive. They are plainly modelled from the primitives of the twentieth century. Pleasant at first, their behaviour soon turns murderous and Pygmalion is killed during his efforts to control them. The Ancients arrive, having sensed that they were needed, and destroy the couple painlessly. Their remains are collected, using sanitary precautions, and burnt at Pygmalion's laboratory, which is also destroyed. The Ancients make use of the occasion to explain the realities of life to the young ones, compare artistic images to dolls and to say interest in them will be outgrown. One's own body is the last of many dolls and it will be shed, as well. A man's eventual destiny is to be bodiless, a vortex of energy, immortal, and free to roam among the stars. Tired of their talk with children, the Ancients go their separate ways. As night is falling, the children seek shelter in the temple. Darkness ensues and the ghost of Adam appears as a vague radiance. Next come the ghosts of Eve and Cain, then those of the Serpent and Lilith, mother of mankind. Each has a say, in accordance with their characters, and Lilith prophesies an end of life's slavery to matter, whereupon the spectres vanish. Commentary Michael Holroyd describes the plays as \\"a masterpiece of wishful thinking\\" and calls them science fiction.Holroyd, Michael, Bernard Shaw: The One-Volume Definitive Edition, p. 503\\\\. (Random House, New York, 1997). Methuselah is said to be Shaw's only real engagement with science fiction. Shaw uses science fictioneering in Methuselah to add plausibility to scenarios and to keep readers entertained while he propounds his vision of the human destiny. His prime interest was not scientific, but political, as stated in the Preface where he discusses changes he considers essential before mankind can govern itself successfully. The final play, As Far as the Mind Can Reach, offers no solution to the problem: Humans evolve to the point of becoming free-ranging vortices of energy, able to wander, solitary, through the Universe, thus requiring no government at all. Furthermore, one of Shaw's last plays, Farfetched Fables (1950) also classifies as science fiction,Farfetched Fables, Bernard Shaw: Complete Plays and Prefaces, Vol. VI, pp. 453–521. (Dodd, Mead & Co.. New York, 1963) and The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles (1934).The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, Bernard Shaw: Complete Plays and Prefaces, Vol. VI, pp. 523–611. (Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, 1963). comes close to qualifying. Shaw had an exalted opinion of Back to Methuselah as both literature and philosophy; in the press release he wrote for its publishers (Constable & Co., London) he said it would \\"interest biologists, religious leaders, and lovers of the marvellous in fiction as well as lovers of the theatre\\" and described it as his supreme work in dramatic literature. He considered it a book for reading rather than playing on the stage, and was agreeably surprised when Lawrence Langner in New York and Barry Vincent Jackson in Birmingham insisted on producing it despite expectations of monetary loss, which were promptly justified.Holroyd, Michael. Bernard Shaw: The One-volume Definitive Edition, p. 497 and pp. 509–11, (Random House, New York, 1997). Unlike the plays Shaw wrote for staging, which include precise descriptions of the settings, the details of stage settings for Methuselah are sketchy and serve only to direct the imagination of the reader. When, e.g., the stage director for the Birmingham production asked how the Serpent was to be presented, Shaw responded with a clumsy sketch and suggested an artist be employed to design costume, colouring and lighting.Bernard Shaw: Collected Letters, 1911-1925, p. 846\\\\. Dan H Laurence, Editor (Viking Penguin, New York, 1985). The BBC, in contrast, was able to provide lavish scenery by sheer power of description for its 1958 radio production of the entire play,The Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw, p. 320\\\\. Christopher James, Editor (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998). Shaw's scientific rationale for evolving long-lived humans depended on the inheritance of acquired characteristics. This accorded with the theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, even though Lamarckism was in decline and Charles Darwin's views were ascendant in 1920, when the plays were written. According to Louis Crompton in Shaw the Dramatist (pp. 252–53):Shaw the Dramatist. Louis Crompton (University of Nebraska Press, 1969). :\\"The most extensive scholarly treatment of Back to Methuselah is H. M. Geduld's six-volume variorum edition of the play submitted as a doctoral thesis at Birkbeck College, University of London (1961). This thesis, which runs to fourteen hundred pages, includes a discussion of the intellectual and literary background, a collation of some forty editions of the text, annotations to the five parts, preface and postscript, and an account of the theatrical history of the play.\\" Copies of this variorum edition are available in the Goldsmiths' Library in the University of London, the Lilly Library at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, and in the Rare Books Collection of the University of Texas at Austin. One quotation from Back to Methuselah is frequently misattributed to Robert F. Kennedy, even though Kennedy stated that he was quoting Shaw--\\"You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, 'Why not?'Back to Methuselah: In the Beginning Bernard Shaw: Complete Plays and Prefaces, Vol. II, p. 6\\\\. (Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, 1963).

It is named after Fortuna, the Roman goddess of chance. FreeBSD uses Fortuna for /dev/random and /dev/urandom is symbolically linked to it since FreeBSD 11.  Design  Fortuna is a family of secure PRNGs; its design leaves some choices open to implementors. It is composed of the following pieces: * The generator itself, which once seeded will produce an indefinite quantity of pseudo-random data. * The entropy accumulator, which collects genuinely random data from various sources and uses it to reseed the generator when enough new randomness has arrived. * The seed file, which stores enough state to enable the computer to start generating random numbers as soon as it has booted. = Generator = The generator is based on any good block cipher. Practical Cryptography suggests AES, Serpent or Twofish. The basic idea is to run the cipher in counter mode, encrypting successive values of an incrementing counter. With a 128-bit block cipher, this would produce statistically identifiable deviations from randomness; for instance, generating 264 genuinely random 128-bit blocks would produce on average about one pair of identical blocks, but there are no repeated blocks at all among the first 2128 produced by a 128-bit cipher in counter mode. Therefore, the key is changed periodically: no more than 1 MiB of data (216 128-bit blocks) is generated without a key change. The book points out that block ciphers with a 256-bit (or greater) block size, which did not enjoy much popularity at the time, do not have this statistical problem. The key is also changed after every data request (however small), so that a future key compromise doesn't endanger previous generator outputs. This property is sometimes described as \\"Fast Key Erasure\\" or Forward secrecy. = Entropy accumulator = The entropy accumulator is designed to be resistant against \\"injection\\" attacks, without needing sophisticated (and inevitably unreliable) estimators of entropy. There are several \\"pools\\" of entropy; each entropy source distributes its alleged entropy evenly over the pools; and (here is the key idea) on the nth reseeding of the generator, pool k is used only if n is a multiple of 2k. Thus, the kth pool is used only 1/2k of the time. Higher-numbered pools, in other words, (1) contribute to reseedings less frequently but (2) collect a larger amount of entropy between reseedings. Reseeding is performed by hashing the specified entropy pools into the block cipher's key using two iterations of SHA-256. = Seeding = Unless an attacker is able to control all the sources of alleged entropy flowing into the system (in which case no algorithm can save it from compromise), there will be some k for which the kth pool collects enough entropy between reseedings that a reseeding with that pool ensures security. And that pool will be used at an interval proportional to the amount of entropy in question. Therefore, the system will always recover from an injection attack, and the time it takes to do so is at most a constant factor greater than the theoretical time it could take if we were able to identify which sources of entropy were corrupt and which not. This conclusion depends on there being enough pools. Fortuna uses 32 pools, and restricts reseeding to happen at most 10 times per second. Running out of pools would then take about 13 years, which Ferguson and Schneier deem long enough for practical purposes. More paranoid implementors, or ones requiring the generation of random data at a colossal rate and correspondingly frequent reseeding, could use a larger number of pools.  Alternatives  Fortuna differs from the earlier Yarrow algorithm family of Schneier, Kelsey and Ferguson mostly in its handling of the entropy accumulator. Yarrow required each source of entropy to be accompanied by a mechanism for estimating the actual entropy supplied, and used only two pools; and its suggested embodiment (called Yarrow-160) used SHA-1 rather than iterated SHA-256.

Collections The library's collection numbers over 2 million items. It was initially established by the purchase of the 62,358 books and other items--assembled by John Adams before he became president-- that had belonged to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. It includes academic journals, academic conference proceedings, reference works, publications by the government, and technical reports, industrial standards, engineering society conference papers, U.S. patents, and monographs. In 1995, the Engineering Societies Library (ESL) was transferred to Library, an acquisition equal in significance to the Academy collection, and greater in terms of the number of volumes received. The ESL collection added depth to both the journal and monograph collections, containing publications of many engineering societies, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society of Civil Engineers, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. Rare Book Collection The library's distinguished History of Science Collection contains more than 50,000 volumes, including first editions of many landmarks of science and technology. Some of the oldest books in the collection date to the fifteenth century, the oldest book in the collection being a 1472 printing of Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia (Natural History). ;Online A number of works can be accessed online, including: * Tycho Brahe's 1632 Astronomicall Coniectur * Georg Joachim Rheticus's Narratio Prima * George Catlin's North American Indian Portfolio ;Notable Holdings The collection includes a number of important scientific works (many written in New Latin and other languages), including: * Georg Joachim Rheticus, Narratio Prima (Gdansk, 1540). * Nicolaus Copernicus, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (Nuremberg, 1543). * Leonhard Fuchs, De historia stirpium commentarii insignes (Basel, 1542). * Galileo Galilei, Sidereus nuncius (Venice, 1610). * Francis Bacon, Instauratio magna (including the Novum Organum) (London, 1620). * Isaac Newton, Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (London, 1687). * Georges Buffon, Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi (Paris, 17491804). * Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species (London, 1859).

This type of circuit is contrasted with synchronous circuits, in which changes to the signal values in the circuit are triggered by repetitive pulses called a clock signal. Most digital devices today use synchronous circuits. However asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster, and may also have advantages in lower power consumption, lower electromagnetic interference, and better modularity in large systems. Asynchronous circuits are an active area of research in digital logic design. Synchronous vs asynchronous logic Digital logic circuits can be divided into combinational logic, in which the output signals depend only on the current input signals, and sequential logic, in which the output depends both on current input and on past inputs. In other words, sequential logic is combinational logic with memory. Virtually all practical digital devices require sequential logic. Sequential logic can be divided into two types, synchronous logic and asynchronous logic. * In synchronous logic circuits, an electronic oscillator generates a repetitive series of equally spaced pulses called the clock signal. The clock signal is applied to all the memory elements in the circuit, called flip-flops. The output of the flip-flops only changes when triggered by the edge of the clock pulse, so changes to the logic signals throughout the circuit all begin at the same time, at regular intervals synchronized by the clock. The output of all memory elements in a circuit is called the state of the circuit. The state of a synchronous circuit changes only on the clock pulse. The changes in signal require a certain amount of time to propagate through the combinational logic gates of the circuit. This is called propagation delay. The period of the clock signal is made long enough so the output of all the logic gates have time to settle to stable values before the next clock pulse. As long as this condition is met, synchronous circuits will operate stably, so they are easy to design. :However a disadvantage of synchronous circuits is that they can be slow. The maximum possible clock rate is determined by the logic path with the longest propagation delay, called the critical path. So logic paths that complete their operations quickly are idle most of the time. Another problem is that the widely distributed clock signal takes a lot of power, and must run whether the circuit is receiving inputs or not. * In asynchronous circuits, there is no clock signal, and the state of the circuit changes as soon as the inputs change. Since asynchronous circuits don't have to wait for a clock pulse to begin processing inputs, they can be faster than synchronous circuits, and their speed is theoretically limited only by the propagation delays of the logic gates. However, asynchronous circuits are more difficult to design and subject to problems not found in synchronous circuits. This is because the resulting state of an asynchronous circuit can be sensitive to the relative arrival times of inputs at gates. If transitions on two inputs arrive at almost the same time, the circuit can go into the wrong state depending on slight differences in the propagation delays of the gates. This is called a race condition. In synchronous circuits this problem is less severe because race conditions can only occur due to inputs from outside the synchronous system, called asynchronous inputs. Although some fully asynchronous digital systems have been built (see below), today asynchronous circuits are typically used in a few critical parts of otherwise synchronous systems where speed is at a premium, such as signal processing circuits. Theoretical foundation The term asynchronous logic is used to describe a variety of design styles, which use different assumptions about circuit properties. These vary from the bundled delay model – which uses \\"conventional\\" data processing elements with completion indicated by a locally generated delay model – to delay-insensitive design – where arbitrary delays through circuit elements can be accommodated. The latter style tends to yield circuits which are larger than bundled data implementations, but which are insensitive to layout and parametric variations and are thus \\"correct by design\\". Asynchronous logic is the logic required for the design of asynchronous digital systems. These function without a clock signal and so individual logic elements cannot be relied upon to have a discrete true/false state at any given time. Boolean (two valued) logic is inadequate for this and so extensions are required. Karl Fant developed a theoretical treatment of this in his work Logically determined design in 2005 which used four-valued logic with null and intermediate being the additional values. This architecture is important because it is quasi-delay-insensitive. Scott Smith and Jia Di developed an ultra-low-power variation of Fant's Null Convention Logic that incorporates multi-threshold CMOS. This variation is termed Multi-threshold Null Convention Logic (MTNCL), or alternatively Sleep Convention Logic (SCL). Vadim Vasyukevich developed a different approach based upon a new logical operation which he called venjunction. This takes into account not only the current value of an element, but also its history. Petri nets are an attractive and powerful model for reasoning about asynchronous circuits. However, Petri nets have been criticized for their lack of physical realism (see Petri net: Subsequent models of concurrency). Subsequent to Petri nets other models of concurrency have been developed that can model asynchronous circuits including the Actor model and process calculi. Benefits A variety of advantages have been demonstrated by asynchronous circuits, including both quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits (generally agreed to be the most \\"pure\\" form of asynchronous logic that retains computational universality) and less pure forms of asynchronous circuitry which use timing constraints for higher performance and lower area and power: * Robust handling of metastability of arbiters. * Higher performance function units, which provide average-case (i.e. data-dependent) completion rather than worst-case completion. Examples include speculative completion which has been applied to design parallel prefix adders faster than synchronous ones, and a high-performance double-precision floating point adder which outperforms leading synchronous designs. * Early completion of a circuit when it is known that the inputs which have not yet arrived are irrelevant. * Lower power consumption because no transistor ever transitions unless it is performing useful computation. Epson has reported 70% lower power consumption compared to synchronous design.\\"Epson Develops the World's First Flexible 8-Bit Asynchronous Microprocessor\\" 2005 Also, clock drivers can be removed which can significantly reduce power consumption. However, when using certain encodings, asynchronous circuits may require more area, which can result in increased power consumption if the underlying process has poor leakage properties (for example, deep submicrometer processes used prior to the introduction of high-κ dielectrics). * \\"Elastic\\" pipelines, which achieve high performance while gracefully handling variable input and output rates and mismatched pipeline stage delays. * Freedom from the ever-worsening difficulties of distributing a high-fan-out, timing-sensitive clock signal. * Better modularity and composability. * Far fewer assumptions about the manufacturing process are required (most assumptions are timing assumptions). * Circuit speed adapts to changing temperature and voltage conditions rather than being locked at the speed mandated by worst-case assumptions. * Immunity to transistor-to- transistor variability in the manufacturing process, which is one of the most serious problems facing the semiconductor industry as dies shrink. * Less severe electromagnetic interference (EMI). Synchronous circuits create a great deal of EMI in the frequency band at (or very near) their clock frequency and its harmonics; asynchronous circuits generate EMI patterns which are much more evenly spread across the spectrum. * In asynchronous circuits, local signaling eliminates the need for global synchronization which exploits some potential advantages in comparison with synchronous ones. They have shown potential specifications in low power consumption, design reuse, improved noise immunity and electromagnetic compatibility. Asynchronous circuits are more tolerant to process variations and external voltage fluctuations. * Less stress on the power distribution network. Synchronous circuits tend to draw a large amount of current right at the clock edge and shortly thereafter. The number of nodes switching (and thence, amount of current drawn) drops off rapidly after the clock edge, reaching zero just before the next clock edge. In an asynchronous circuit, the switching times of the nodes are not correlated in this manner, so the current draw tends to be more uniform and less bursty. Disadvantages * Area overhead caused by an increase in the number of circuit elements (transistors). In some cases an asynchronous design may require up to double the resources of a synchronous design, due to addition of completion detection and design-for-test circuits. * Fewer people are trained in this style compared to synchronous design. * Synchronous designs are inherently easier to test and debug than asynchronous designs. \\"Keep It Strictly Synchronous: KISS those asynchronous-logic problems good-bye\\". Personal Engineering and Instrumentation News, November 1997, pages 53–55. http://www.fpga-site.com/kiss.html However, this position is disputed by Fant, who claims that the apparent simplicity of synchronous logic is an artifact of the mathematical models used by the common design approaches. * Clock gating in more conventional synchronous designs is an approximation of the asynchronous ideal, and in some cases, its simplicity may outweigh the advantages of a fully asynchronous design. * Performance (speed) of asynchronous circuits may be reduced in architectures that require input- completeness (more complex data path). * Lack of dedicated, asynchronous design-focused commercial EDA tools. Communication There are several ways to create asynchronous communication channels that can be classified by their protocol and data encoding. =Protocols= There are two widely used protocol families which differ in the way communications are encoded: *two-phase handshake ( two-phase protocol, Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) encoding, or transition signalling): Communications are represented by any wire transition; transitions from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 both count as communications. *four- phase handshake (a.k.a. four-phase protocol, or Return-to-Zero (RZ) encoding): Communications are represented by a wire transition followed by a reset; a transition sequence from 0 to 1 and back to 0 counts as single communication. Illustration of two and four-phase handshakes. Top: A sender and a receiver are communicating with simple request and acknowledge signals. The sender drives the request line, and the receiver drives the acknowledge line. Middle: Timing diagram of two, two-phase communications. Bottom: Timing diagram of one, four-phase communication. Despite involving more transitions per communication, circuits implementing four-phase protocols are usually faster and simpler than two-phase protocols because the signal lines return to their original state by the end of each communication. In two-phase protocols, the circuit implementations would have to store the state of the signal line internally. Note that these basic distinctions do not account for the wide variety of protocols. These protocols may encode only requests and acknowledgements or also encode the data, which leads to the popular multi- wire data encoding. Many other, less common protocols have been proposed including using a single wire for request and acknowledgment, using several significant voltages, using only pulses or balancing timings in order to remove the latches. =Data encoding= There are two widely used data encodings in asynchronous circuits: bundled-data encoding and multi-rail encoding Another common way to encode the data is to use multiple wires to encode a single digit: the value is determined by the wire on which the event occurs. This avoids some of the delay assumptions necessary with bundled-data encoding, since the request and the data are not separated anymore. Bundled-data encoding Bundled-data encoding uses one wire per bit of data with a request and an acknowledge signal; this is the same encoding used in synchronous circuits without the restriction that transitions occur on a clock edge. The request and the acknowledge are sent on separate wires with one of the above protocols. These circuits usually assume a bounded delay model with the completion signals delayed long enough for the calculations to take place. In operation, the sender signals the availability and validity of data with a request. The receiver then indicates completion with an acknowledgement, indicating that it is able to process new requests. That is, the request is bundled with the data, hence the name \\"bundled-data\\". Bundled- data circuits are often referred to as micropipelines, whether they use a two- phase or four-phase protocol, even if the term was initially introduced for two-phase bundled-data. A 4-phase, bundled-data communication. Top: A sender and receiver are connected by data lines, a request line, and an acknowledge line. Bottom: Timing diagram of a bundled data communication. When the request line is low, the data is to be considered invalid and liable to change at any time. Multi-rail encoding Multi-rail encoding uses multiple wires without a one-to-one relationship between bits and wires and a separate acknowledge signal. Data availability is indicated by the transitions themselves on one or more of the data wires (depending on the type of multi- rail encoding) instead of with a request signal as in the bundled-data encoding. This provides the advantage that the data communication is delay- insensitive. Two common multi-rail encodings are one-hot and dual rail. The one-hot (a.k.a. 1-of-n) encoding represents a number in base n with a communication on one of the n wires. The dual-rail encoding uses pairs of wires to represent each bit of the data, hence the name \\"dual-rail\\"; one wire in the pair represents the bit value of 0 and the other represents the bit value of 1. For example, a dual-rail encoded two bit number will be represented with two pairs of wires for four wires in total. During a data communication, communications occur on one of each pair of wires to indicate the data's bits. In the general case, an m \\\\times n encoding represent data as m words of base n. Diagram of dual rail and 1-of-4 communications. Top: A sender and receiver are connected by data lines and an acknowledge line. Middle: Timing diagram of the sender communicating the values 0, 1, 2, and then 3 to the receiver with the 1-of-4 encoding. Bottom: Timing diagram of the sender communicating the same values to the receiver with the dual-rail encoding. For this particular data size, the dual rail encoding is the same as a 2x1-of-2 encoding. Dual-rail encoding with a four-phase protocol is the most common and is also called three-state encoding, since it has two valid states (10 and 01, after a transition) and a reset state (00). Another common encoding, which leads to a simpler implementation than one-hot, two-phase dual-rail is four-state encoding, or level-encoded dual-rail, and uses a data bit and a parity bit to achieve a two-phase protocol. Asynchronous CPU Asynchronous CPUs are one of several ideas for radically changing CPU design. Unlike a conventional processor, a clockless processor (asynchronous CPU) has no central clock to coordinate the progress of data through the pipeline. Instead, stages of the CPU are coordinated using logic devices called \\"pipeline controls\\" or \\"FIFO sequencers.\\" Basically, the pipeline controller clocks the next stage of logic when the existing stage is complete. In this way, a central clock is unnecessary. It may actually be even easier to implement high performance devices in asynchronous, as opposed to clocked, logic: * components can run at different speeds on an asynchronous CPU; all major components of a clocked CPU must remain synchronized with the central clock; * a traditional CPU cannot \\"go faster\\" than the expected worst-case performance of the slowest stage/instruction/component. When an asynchronous CPU completes an operation more quickly than anticipated, the next stage can immediately begin processing the results, rather than waiting for synchronization with a central clock. An operation might finish faster than normal because of attributes of the data being processed (e.g., multiplication can be very fast when multiplying by 0 or 1, even when running code produced by a naive compiler), or because of the presence of a higher voltage or bus speed setting, or a lower ambient temperature, than 'normal' or expected. Asynchronous logic proponents believe these capabilities would have these benefits: * lower power dissipation for a given performance level, and * highest possible execution speeds. The biggest disadvantage of the clockless CPU is that most CPU design tools assume a clocked CPU (i.e., a synchronous circuit). Many tools \\"enforce synchronous design practices\\".\\"ASIC to FPGA migration\\" Making a clockless CPU (designing an asynchronous circuit) involves modifying the design tools to handle clockless logic and doing extra testing to ensure the design avoids metastable problems. The group that designed the AMULET, for example, developed a tool called LARDLARD to cope with the complex design of AMULET3. Despite the difficulty of doing so, numerous asynchronous CPUs have been built, including: * the ORDVAC and the (identical) ILLIAC I (1951) \\"In the 1950 and 1960s, asynchronous design was used in many early mainframe computers, including the ILLIAC I and ILLIAC II ... .\\" Brief History of asynchronous circuit design \\"The Illiac is a binary parallel asynchronous computer in which negative numbers are represented as two's complements.\\" – final summary of \\"Illiac Design Techniques\\" 1955. * the Johnniac (1953)Johnniac history written in 1968 * the WEIZAC (1955) * the ILLIAC II (1962) * The Victoria University of Manchester built Atlas (1964) * The ICL 1906A and 1906S mainframe computers, part of the 1900 series and sold from 1964 for over a decade by ICL * The Honeywell CPUs 6180 (1972) \\"Entirely asynchronous, its hundred-odd boards would send out requests, earmark the results for somebody else, swipe somebody else's signals or data, and backstab each other in all sorts of amusing ways which occasionally failed (the \\"op not complete\\" timer would go off and cause a fault). ...

The ILLIAC II was the first completely asynchronous, speed independent processor design ever built; it was the most powerful computer at the time. DEC PDP-16 Register Transfer Modules (ca. 1973) allowed the experimenter to construct asynchronous, 16-bit processing elements. Delays for each module were fixed and based on the module's worst-case timing. The Caltech Asynchronous Microprocessor (1988) was the first asynchronous microprocessor (1988). Caltech designed and manufactured the world's first fully Quasi Delay Insensitive processor. During demonstrations, the researchers loaded a simple program which ran in a tight loop, pulsing one of the output lines after each instruction. This output line was connected to an oscilloscope. When a cup of hot coffee was placed on the chip, the pulse rate (the effective \\"clock rate\\") naturally slowed down to adapt to the worsening performance of the heated transistors. When liquid nitrogen was poured on the chip, the instruction rate shot up with no additional intervention. Additionally, at lower temperatures, the voltage supplied to the chip could be safely increased, which also improved the instruction rate – again, with no additional configuration. In 2004, Epson manufactured the world's first bendable microprocessor called ACT11, an 8-bit asynchronous chip.\\"Seiko Epson tips flexible processor via TFT technology\\" by Mark LaPedus 2005 \\"A flexible 8b asynchronous microprocessor based on low-temperature poly-silicon TFT technology\\" by Karaki et al. 2005.

The processor is intended for use in smart cards, whose chips are currently limited in size to those small enough that they can remain perfectly rigid. In 2014, IBM announced a SyNAPSE-developed chip that runs in an asynchronous manner, with one of the highest transistor counts of any chip ever produced.

It first appeared in issue 1, dated 4 December 1937, except for one issue, No. 294 (9 June 1945) when Keyhole Kate was on the cover. In 1984, after 47 virtually continuous years, Korky was replaced on the front cover by Desperate Dan. History The strip's simple premise follows the adventures of a black male cat called Korky, a cat who behaves like a human and is accepted in a world of humans as only a comic character can be. Originally a mute character, he started speaking in No. 149, 5 October 1940 (see image for his first words as he tries to help some hungry dogs). The 1950s saw the introduction of his 'Kits', Nip, Lip, and Rip. Artists were: *James Crighton from issues 1 to 1051 (4 December 1937 to 13 January 1962. *Charles Grigg from issues 1052 to 2116 (20 January 1962 to 12 June 1982. *David Gudgeon from issue 2117 (19 June 1982 to 1986). *Robert Nixon from 1986 to 1999 *Phil Corbett from 2010 After 1984, Korky still continued inside the comic, however, and a picture of him remained next to the Dandy logo until 1998. When Robert Nixon took over drawing in the Dandy issue dated 1 November 1986, some changes were made. Korky, whose look had remained virtually the same since the 1940s, now looked noticeably different, particularly in the case of his eyes (though the picture of him next to the Dandy logo was never changed). The focus of the strip also switched more to the Kits, who had been promoted from their originally minor role. So much so, that at one point the strip had been renamed Korky the Cat and the Kits. When Nixon went into semi retirement at the beginning of 1999 (relinquishing Beryl the Peril at the same time) several different artists took up the pen, including David Sutherland (who also draws The Bash Street Kids from The Beano, and used to draw Dennis the Menace) at first, Steve Bright, Lesley Reavey, Dave Windett later on (who introduced a mouse called Squeak and his friends to the cast), and, by 2003, Henry Davies, who was creating hybrid strips from Charles Grigg's classic Korky strips and new elements drawn by Davies. By 2004, though, the popularity of Korky with readers had significantly dropped. In that year's readers poll, Korky had failed to receive a single vote, either as a favourite character, or a least favourite. With this in mind, it was decided to retire the character after almost 70 years. His apparent last appearance was in issue 3294, dated 8 January 2005, in which, possibly hinting at his unpopularity, he turned up at a school reunion and found that no one knew who he was. However, on 21 September 2005, it was announced on the Dandy website that Korky was to return in December with a new artist and in new adventures. Quite why the Dandy staff decided to over-rule the decision to retire him is unclear, but most likely apathy from fans brought about this change. Korky returned from issue 3338, dated 19 November 2005, this time being drawn by Andrew Painter on computer. The strip was again dropped when the Dandy was re-branded into the magazine- themed \\"Dandy Xtreme\\". Korky returned again in the Dandy Xtreme Holiday Special, drawn by new Bananaman artist C. McGhie. , reprints of Korky strips by Nixon are appearing in the Dandy Xtreme. The Dandy was relaunched on 27 October 2010 with Phil Corbett taking over as the Korky artist. Corbett's Korky is squatter than previous incarnations of the cat with dark blue fur rather than black. The trademark red nose, green eyes and fluffy white belly remain the same. Miscellaneous Adult comic Viz parodied \\"Korky the Cat\\" in a strip entitled \\"Korky the Twat\\" as part of an ongoing feud with Dandy publishers D.C. Thomson. Viz also parodied other popular D.C. Thomson strips, such as \\"Desperately Unfunny Dan\\", \\"Arsehole Kate\\", \\"Roger the Lodger\\" and \\"The McBrowntrouts\\".

Music career Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Boon joined the Inspiral Carpets in 1986 after previously playing in a band called The Mill. After the Inspiral Carpets split in 1995, Boon went on to form The Clint Boon Experience releasing two albums under this name – The Compact Guide to Pop Music and Space Travel (1999), and Life in Transition (2000). In this year the band released the single \\"Do What You Do (Earworm Song)\\", which featured Fran Healy, the lead singer of the band Travis. Boon has his own record label, 'Booney Tunes', signing artists such as Elaine Palmer, and has also been a regular DJ at a number of nightclubs around England, and in Wrexham, North Wales. He rejoined the Inspiral Carpets for two sell-out tours in 2002 and 2003 and has remained with them. Media career Boon made a cameo appearance in the 2002 film, 24 Hour Party People as a train conductor and also worked with Cosgrove Hall providing music for the Engie Benjy cartoon series. In 1995 Boon began working for Liverpool's Crash FM after being recruited by DJ Janice Long and has also stood in for DJ Terry Christian on Century FM in Manchester. In 2005 Boon became head of music of the Oldham-based radio station, The Revolution, where he presented the 10am to 2pm weekday show. in 2006 he left the station for, then rival station, Xfm Manchester where he began presenting the drivetime show. The following year Boon received two Sony Award nominations for his XFM show in the Music Broadcaster and Specialist Music Programme categories. Boon has a cult following, with regular listeners to his show being unofficially enrolled in the Boon Army. From September 2015, Xfm Manchester transitioned into Radio X and began broadcasting nationally; Boon then hosted a Sunday evening show between 7pm and 11pm. It was shortened to 8pm to 11pm from 23 April 2016. His last show was on 19 March 2017. He has been a resident DJ on Saturday nights at the club 'South' in Manchester for fifteen years, while also hosting other nights around the UK. From 16 January 2016, Boon presented an 80s music show on BBC Radio Manchester on Saturdays between 6pm and 8pm. He left the station in March 2017. Clint Boon started his new drivetime radio show, #ThatsGoodInnit at XS Manchester on 27 March 2017. References in popular culture In 2008 Boon had his portrait painted by Manchester-based artist Adam Hayley. The portrait represents many aspects of Boon's life and incorporates references to his Manchester roots. The portrait was unveiled at Manchester's Mooch Art Gallery on Oldham Street, in the Northern Quarter. Subsequently, Adam Hayley donated the painting to the Boon family. Charity work In 2013, Boon became patron of SiMBA, a charity supporting parents who have lost a very young baby, following the death of his daughter, Luna Bliss, who was born prematurely in April 2012 at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester and died 34 days later. Boon's middle son Hector wanted to raise money for the hospital and was sponsored to have his long hair cut with the fundraising appeal becoming known as Hector's Fund. The Boon family continue to raise money for St. Mary's and to date Hector's Fund has raised £40,000 and paid for custom-made mother and baby feeding chairs for the hospital. In January 2015, Boon launched a campaign to recruit runners to take part in the 10K Great Manchester Run to raise money for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Charity and the Saint Mary's Hospital Charity's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Members of the public were invited to sign up and run as part of the Boon Army to raise sponsorship money for the charities.

The term may describe different establishments depending on the region, but in general, supper clubs tend to present themselves as having a high-class image, even if the price is affordable to all. A newer usage of the term supper club has emerged, referring to underground restaurants. Other names Supper clubs, when used in the newer context of underground restaurants, are also known as home bistros, guerrilla diners, secret restaurants, paladares, puertas cerradas, pop-up restaurants, guestaurants, speakeasies, and anti- restaurants. In Antiquity Supper clubs were common in the Roman Empire. One of the most notable clubs was that of Mithraism. These clubs often spanned social classes but primarily served all-male members. Supper Clubs served an important role in the division of labor, especially within in the Roman imperial administration and military. By pooling and specializing resources needed for basic nourishment, Rome was able to gain a productivity advantage over its neighbors and subjected peoples. In the United States Village Bar Supper Club in Wisconsin In the U.S., a supper club is a dining establishment generally found across the United States, but currently concentrated in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Iowa. These establishments typically are located on the edge of town in rural areas. =History= The first supper club in the United States was established in Beverly Hills, California, by Milwaukee, Wisconsin native Lawrence Frank. Supper clubs became popular during the 1930s and 1940s, although some establishments that later became supper clubs had previously gained notoriety as prohibition roadhouses.Brenda K. Bredahl, \\"The state of the supper club scene\\", Chicago Tribune, August 26, 2007. With the legalization of recreational cannabis in states like California, cannabis supper clubs have begun to emerge, including one by Masterchef alumni and fan favorite, Nick Nappi. Traditionally supper clubs were considered a \\"destination\\" where patrons would spend the whole evening, from cocktail hour to nightclub-style entertainment after dinner.Dennis Getto, \\"Supper clubs that are a cut above prime time\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Featuring a casual and relaxed atmosphere, they are now usually just restaurants rather than the all- night entertainment destinations of the past. =Typical menu= Supper clubs generally feature \\"simple\\" menus with somewhat limited offerings featuring \\"American\\" cuisine. Menus include dishes such as prime rib, steaks, chicken, and fish. An all-you-can-eat Friday night fish fry is particularly common at Wisconsin supper clubs. Relish trays with items such as crackers, carrots, green onions, pickles, radishes, and celery are typically served at the table on Lazy Susans. In the United Kingdom Supper clubs in the UK adopted the cabaret concept of the American 1930s and 1940s and aimed to bring the ambience of the underground New York jazz club to the UK entertainment scene, where people could enjoy a dinner without the formality of a ball, whilst enjoying live music. These clubs were often the centre of social networks in both rural communities and cities. Traditional supper club menus consisted of standard American fare, and in the UK there was a concerted drive to give the food and wine a British twist.Fernandez and Leluu's Game On Menu Some supper clubs were purely informal dining societies whilst others incorporated musical acts to complement the atmosphere. There was also a form of supper club which acted as an informal dating platform. Both have largely been replaced by modern nightclubs. The term \\"supper club\\" is enjoying a revival with slightly different meaning - generally a small underground club (often with roving premises which are only revealed to the guests when they buy a ticket), where guests eat from a restricted or set menuthe Basement Galley Menus and are expected to fraternise with other guests whom they may not know.Diners Guide Simon Dogget In the UK 'Underground Restaurants' and 'Supper Clubs' have started to blossom, with reviews in leading newspapers such as The Times and The Guardian. They range across the UK but are mainly concentrated in London. These are advertised by word of mouth and on social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook. There are a number of ways to find out about supper clubs including social media and also the website Eat My World which lists events all over the UK. Some supper clubs in London are advertised on Grub Club, a London online supperclub platform. In Latin America In Latin America, a supper club is typically an underground restaurant known as either a paladar or a restaurante de puertas cerradas (locked door restaurant). Although technically illegal, this type of restaurant is built into the culture, often with higher standards than many licensed establishments.http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/apr/17/undergroundrestaurants. They are becoming increasingly popular in the U.S.http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/may/29/underground- restaurants-msmarmitelover-hardeep. The attraction of the underground restaurant for the customer is the ability to sample new food at low prices outside the traditional restaurant experience. For the host, benefits are making some money and experimenting with cooking without having to invest in a restaurant proper. As one host told the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"It's literally like playing restaurant... You can create the event, and then it's over.\\" See also * Dining club * List of supper clubs * Song and supper room ReferencesExternal links * WisconsinSupperClubs.com, a listing of over 250 supper clubs in Wisconsin. * Mount, Ian.

It included a Linux-based operating system, a USB keyboard and mouse, a VGA adapter, a PS2 network adapter (Ethernet only), and a 40 GB hard disk drive (HDD). An 8 MB memory card is required; it must be formatted during installation, erasing all data previously saved on it, though afterwards the remaining space may be used for savegames. It is strongly recommended that a user of Linux for PlayStation 2 have some basic knowledge of Linux before installing and using it, due to the command-line interface for installation. The official site for the project was closed at the end of October 2009https://web.archive.org/web/20100114201506/http://playstation2-linux.com/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1251 and communities like ps2dev are no longer active. There is still a small group of enthusiasts that meets on Freenode in the channel #sps2.  Capabilities  The Linux Kit turns the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system, but it does not allow for use of the DVD-ROM drive except to read PS1 and PS2 discs due to piracy concerns by Sony. Although the HDD included with the Linux Kit is not compatible with PlayStation 2 games, reformatting the HDD with the utility disc provided with the retail HDD enables use with PlayStation 2 games but erases PS2 Linux, though there is a driver that allows PS2 Linux to operate once copied onto the APA partition created by the utility disc. The Network Adapter included with the kit only supports Ethernet; a driver is available to enable modem support if the retail Network Adapter (which includes a built-in V.90 modem) is used. The kit supports display on RGB monitors (with sync-on-green) using a VGA cable provided with the Linux Kit, or television sets with the normal cable included with the PlayStation 2 unit. The PS2 Linux distribution is based on Kondara MNU/Linux, a Japanese distribution itself based on Red Hat Linux. PS2 Linux is similar to Red Hat Linux 6, and has most of the features one might expect in a Red Hat Linux 6 system. The stock kernel is Linux 2.2.1 (although it includes the USB drivers from Linux 2.2.18 to support the keyboard and mouse), but it can be upgraded to a newer version such as 2.2.21, 2.2.26 or 2.4.17.  Open-source applications  Contents of the Linux kit; the hard disk is already installed inside the machine, and the network adaptor is attached to the back. The Linux kit's primary purpose is amateur software development, but it can be used as one would use any other computer, although the small amount of memory in the PS2 (32MB) limits its applications. Noted open source software that compiles on the kit includes Mozilla Suite, XChat, and Pidgin. Lightweight applications better suited to the PS2's 32MB of RAM include xv, Dillo, Ted, and AbiWord. The default window manager is Window Maker, but it is possible to install and use Fluxbox and FVWM. The USB ports of the console can be connected to external devices, such as printers, cameras, flash drives, and CD drives. With PS2 Linux, a user can program their own games that will work under PS2 Linux, but not on an unmodified PlayStation 2. Free open source code for games are available for download from PS2 Linux support sites. There is little difference between PS2 Linux and the Linux software used on the more expensive system (\\"Tool\\", DTL-T10000) used by professional licensed PlayStation game programmers. Some amateur-created games are submitted to a competition such as the Independent Games Festival's annual competition. It is possible for an amateur to sell games or software that they develop using PS2 Linux, with certain restrictions detailed in the End User License Agreement. The amateur cannot make and sell game CDs and DVDs, but can sell the game through an online download.  Distribution  As of 2003, this kit is no longer officially sold in the US due to the entire allocation of NTSC kits being sold out, but it is available through import or through an auction site, such as eBay. Some incorrectly speculate it was used as an attempt to help classify the PS2 as a computer to achieve tax exempt status from certain EU taxes that apply to game consoles and not computers (It was the Yabasic included with EU units that was intended to do that). Despite this, Sony lost the case in June 2006. The kit was released in the spirit of the earlier Net Yaroze. PlayStation and Sony ended their support of hobbyist programmers with the support of Linux on the PlayStation 3 being discontinued.  Model compatibility  The original version of the PS2 Linux kit worked on only the Japanese SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000 and SCPH-18000 PlayStation 2 models. It came with a PCMCIA interface card which had a 10/100 Ethernet port and an external IDE hard drive enclosure (as there is no room inside the unit). This kit cannot be used with any later model PS2 (which includes all non-Japanese models) because these models removed the PCMCIA port. Later versions of the PS2 Linux kit use an interface very similar to the HDD interface/Ethernet sold later for network play (the later released Network adaptor was also usable with the kit, including the built-in 56k modem.) This kit locates the hard drive internal to the PS2, in the MultiBay. With this kit, only the SCPH-30000 model of PlayStation 2 is officially supported. The kit does though work equally well with models newer than SCPH-30000 with the exception that the Ethernet connection tended to freeze after a short period of use. Thus the newer SCPH-50000 PlayStation 2 model will only work correctly with PS2 Linux with an updated network adapter driver, which must be transferred to the PlayStation 2 HDD by using either an older model PlayStation 2 to transfer the driver or a Linux PC with an IDE port. Both methods involve swapping HDDs. This is due to the inability to use USB Mass Storage devices with the relatively old kernel (version 2.2.1) shipped with the kit. The slim SCPH-70000 PlayStation 2 model does not work with PS2 Linux at all, due to the lack of a hard drive interface, though a very few early models in this revision had solder pads of an IDE interface on the motherboard that could be used (but required modding of the console, thereby voiding its warranty.) Even so, it is possible to network boot from a PXE server. PS2 Linux installation DVDs are region encoded, as are all other PS2 game discs. A European/PAL disc will be rejected by an NTSC PlayStation 2 game system; however this is only at boot time: if the user has a mod that allows them to load a PAL disk, then the PS2 Linux boot loader supports both PAL and NTSC Linux (read the documentation to determine the button presses), so once they are past the \\"DVD not supported\\", they can boot Linux and then later start X Window in NTSC mode.  Unofficial support  Ever since the discontinuation of the PS2 Linux Kit and some time before that there has been a large, less active group who have tried and succeeded to run the Linux operating system through other methods, most notably using the KernelLoader Linux loader developed by Mega Man since 2008 where they have copied the necessary kernel files onto removable storage or DVDs formatted as Video DVDs due to Sony's anti-piracy efforts which restrict any data DVDs and loaded them through the program. Through this method it has become possible to use custom Linux distros and other UNIX-like operating systems compiled for the PlayStation 2 and this has enabled users to use more compatible Linux kernels with smaller footprints and programs specially designed for the console. These methods often require the use of PS2 exploits such as Free MCBoot which allows the end user to boot from the PlayStation 2 memory card and launch custom made homebrew applications packaged as ELF files and other exploits such as SwapMagic etc. however these tend to void the warranty as some require the opening of the PlayStation 2 console itself.

History The system opened in 1989, replacing a former tram line (1899–1971), that used a rack for braking but not propulsion. There were three stations. The cars ran on rubber tyres on a metallic track at a 2.5 min headway. Four vehicles were used by the system, and each of them could carry 33 passengers at a maximum speed of 35 km/h. The maximum capacity was 900 passengers/hour, and most recent ridership before is closure was about 1500 passengers/day. The system ran every day from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and every day in Summer. Going from the station Gare to the station Hôtel de Ville took 3.5 min.

Northern Ireland has its own legislation. Section 61(12) defines sites that warrant protection due to their being of national importance as 'ancient monuments'. These can be either scheduled monuments or \\"any other monument which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is of public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching to it\\". A monument is defined as: Damage to an ancient monument is a criminal offence and any works taking place within one require scheduled monument consent from the Secretary of State. The Act also provides for taking monuments into the care of the Secretary of State – the concept of 'guardianship' where a monument remains in private ownership but the monument is cared for and (usually) opened to the public by the relevant national heritage body. The Act (in Part II) also introduced the concept of areas of archaeological importance, city centres of historic significance which receive limited further protection by forcing developers to permit archaeological access prior to building work starting. As of 2004 only five city centres, all in England, have been designated AAIs (Canterbury, Chester, Exeter, Hereford and York). Part II of the Act was never commenced in Scotland. As the provisions in AAIs are limited compared with the requirements that can be made of developers through the NPPF, and formerly its predecessors in PPS5 and PPG16, AAIs have fallen out of use.

Viking Literature, 2006) Biography Aud was the second daughter of Ketill Flatnose, a Norwegian hersir, and Yngvid Ketilsdóttir, daughter of Ketill Wether, a hersir from Ringerike. Aud married Olaf the White (Oleif), son of King Ingjald, who had named himself King of Dublin after going on voyages to Britain and then conquering the shire of Dublin. They had a son named Thorstein the Red. After Oleif was killed in battle in Ireland, Aud and Thorstein journeyed to the Hebrides. Thorstein married there and had six daughters and one son. He also became a great warrior king, conquering in northern Scotland; however, he was killed in battle after being betrayed by his people. Hvammur í Dölum, Dalabyggð Upon learning of the death of Thorstein, Aud, who was then at Caithness, commissioned a construction of a knarr, a Viking era ship commonly built for Atlantic voyages. She had the ship built secretly in the forest, for unknown reasons. After its completion, Aud captained the ship to Orkney. There she married off one of her granddaughters, Groa, the daughter of Thorstein the Red, and then Aud captained the ship on its sail to the area of Breiðafjörður in Iceland.\\"Chapter 6 - Unn Divides her Land\\" (The Laxdale Saga 1880, English transl.)

In addition to the crew, there were other men on her ship, prisoners from Viking raids near and around the British Isles. Aud gave these men their freedom once they were in Iceland, making them freed-men, a class between slave and free, where they were not owned but did not have all the rights of a free-born man. She also gave them land to farm and upon which they could make a living. One of these men so rewarded was Vifil, who was given Vifilsdal, part of Hvammur í Skeggjadal, the area in which Aud settled. When Aud arrived in the western region of Iceland, she claimed all the land in Dalasýsla between the rivers Dagverdara and Skraumuhlaupsa for her family.Auður the Deep-minded (The Settlement of Dalasýsla) Eiríksstaðir Haukadal Unlike most early Icelandic settlers, Aud was a baptized Christian and is commonly credited with bringing Christianity to Iceland. Aud erected crosses where she could pray on a prominent hill within her lands, now known as Krossholar (Krosshólaborg).Krosshólaborg (Dalabyggd) Eiríksstaðir Haukadal The cause of Aud's journeying has been debated. Other accounts say that Olaf the White (aka Olaf of Dublin and Olaf Guthfrithsson of Vestfold) was not killed in Ireland, and returned to Norway in 871 to regain control of his father’s kingdom. Icelandic tradition states that Ketil Flatnose died in the Scottish Isles, and the collapse of his family’s fortune was complete with the slaying of Ketil’s grandson, Thorstein the Red. Upon the death of Aud’s son, Thorstein, “She felt, according to Laxdoela Saga, she did not have much chance of recovering her position”, and she commissioned a ship to be built secretly in the woods, and assembled her entire kin, her slaves and some of her family friends and led an expedition via Orkney and the Faroes to find a new life in her old age.Warlords and Holy Men by Alfred P. Smith, Edinburgh University Press 2010, first published in 1984 by Edward Arnold Publishers, Ltd. p.161 Primary sources Aud figures in several Norse sagas, including Landnámabók, Njáls saga, Laxdæla saga, Eyrbyggja saga, Eiríks saga rauða and Grettis saga. Twelfth and thirteenth century Icelandic writers commonly believed that their country had been settled by Norwegians of noble birth who had been persecuted in Norway. The problem that dogged medieval Icelandic historiography was an understandable desire to avoid the charge that the country had been founded by a group of unruly Scottish Vikings. However, it is no longer possible to dismiss these tales of Aud and her father Ketil as unverifiable oral traditions, as this Scottish tradition in Icelandic oral history is of far greater antiquity than the thirteenth century saga age. The National Museum of Iceland contains an impressive collection of somewhat debased penannular brooches and pins of undoubted Celtic provenance from the ninth and tenth centuries which would fit well in the context of the Hebridean Norse–Gael.Warlords and Holy Men by Alfred P. Smith, Edinburgh University Press 2010, first published in 1984 by Edward Arnold Publishers, Ltd. p163,165 Portrayal A loosely based, Aud, also daughter of Ketill Flatnose and involved with the settlement of Iceland, is portrayed by Leah McNamara in the 5th season of the historical drama television series Vikings. Also, portrayed briefly, with family links, as the 'ancestress of most icelanders' in the 1992 science fiction anthology 'Tales of Riverworld' Ed. Philip Jose Farmer, in the story 'crossing the dark river' by the same author.

He is considered one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment Era in the Slovene Lands of Habsburg Austria. Family Sigmund's father Michelangelo Zois (1694–1777) was a merchant from Lombardy that moved to Ljubljana, where he made a considerable fortune in dealing with iron and holding mines. His second marriage was to a Carniolan (Slovenian) noblewoman from the family Kappus (also Kapus) von Pichelstein; he was ennobled in 1739 and acquired the right to the title of baron in 1760. He owned large estates both in Carniola and on the Karst Plateau, and Sigmund was born in Trieste, in one of his father's mansions. The Carniolan noble family Kappus von Pichelstein on Zois's mother's side was a prosperous family that had lived at Kamna Gorica in Upper Carniola for centuries, where the family had owned an iron foundry and an iron mine since the late Middle Ages, perhaps since the 12th century. Marcus Antonius Kappus von Pichelstein (1657–1717) worked as a Jesuit missionary in Sonora (the border region between today’s United States and Mexico). From there he wrote letters to his friends in Vienna and to his relatives in Carniola. In these letters he described discoveries by research expeditions in Arizona and California and described the living conditions, the climate, and other details. Carolus Josephus Kappus von Pichelstein, a nephew of Marcus Antonius, was member of the Academia Operosorum, which was founded in Ljubljana in 1693 after the example of similar academies in Italy. Vladimir Kappus von Pichelstein (1885–1943), a Slovene writer and publisher, was also from the Kappus family. Education After attending several private schools, Sigmund Zois moved to Reggio in the duchy of Modena where he continued his education. He enjoyed traveling and making new acquaintances. However, his way of life was soon truncated by gout, a disease with which he would be stricken the rest of his life. After returning to Ljubljana to assist in business, he studied natural sciences with Gabriel Gruber and Giuseppe Maffei and inherited his father's wealth in 1777. Leaving the management of his economic entities to his cousin, he developed a strong interest in sciences and started to meet with Baltazar Hacquet, who taught anatomy in Ljubljana from 1773 to 1787, and several Slovene intellectuals of the time. The Zois circle Zois Mansion in Ljubljana In the early 1780s, his mansion in Ljubljana became a fostering center for liberal intellectuals at the center of the Slovene enlightenment. Jurij Japelj and Blaž Kumerdej (the two published the Bible in Slovene language), Anton Tomaž Linhart, Valentin Vodnik (from 1793) and Jernej Kopitar (from 1803) were the most prominent members of what became known as the “Zois circle”. Zois was their patron, mentoring them and granting them necessary financial support for their cultural and scientific efforts, thus becoming the central figure of the Slovenian enlightenment. He was a deist and his views were rational and empirical. Nevertheless, he strongly opposed the French revolution and supported the moderate enlightened constitutionalism of Leopold II. In Ljubljana, Zois initiated and sponsored the construction of roads, the foundation of the botanical garden and a (German) theatre (whose main shareholder he became) and the enlargement of the lyceal library. His great commitment in sciences contrasted in neglecting the needs of the farmers on his estates, who waged surrection in 1783 and were oppressed by Zois' managers. Only after the French Revolution he ordered obligation towards his subjects, fearing for his properties. In 1784, Zois was visited by the French geologist and mineralogist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu. From 1797 onwards, Sigmund Zois used a wheelchair and didn't leave his mansion in Ljubljana anymore. The literary opus of Sigmund Zois, of modest quality and little influence, includes many literary forms and genres, ranging from arias for the opera to lyrics for folk music, although probably only a minor part of his work has been preserved. His translation of the poem Lenore by Gottfried August Burger was regarded as a complete failure, and Zois himself later came to the conclusion that the Slovene language was \\"too mediocre and rough\\" to allow for such a literary achievement. He would be disproven only some decades later by France Prešeren who managed to compose a complex and exceptional translation of the same poem. Zois is also regarded as a father of Slovene literary criticism, and most of his literary reviews can be found in his correspondence with Valentin Vodnik. Zois, who was considered to have been the wealthiest Carniolan of his time, died in Ljubljana. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd; to these days, it has been considered one of the biggest funeral ceremonies ever held in the city, together with Anton Aškerc's funeral in 1912, and Janez Evangelist Krek's funeral in 1917. Scientific and collecting work Zois was particularly known as a mineralogist and geologist. In 1795, he mounted two expeditions to explore the land around the Triglav mountain. In 1805, Abraham Gottlob Werner described the mineral zoisite and named it after Zois, who sent him its specimens from Saualpe in Carinthia. His collection of minerals (around 5,000 items) is kept at the Natural History Museum of Slovenia. He was also involved in botany and zoology. His ornithological writings, particularly Nomenclatura carniolica, contain the first records of Slovene names of the majority of the birds living in Carniola and were the foundation for the Slovene ornithological nomenclature. He supported the work of his brother, the botanist Karl Zois, who, among other things, discovered the Campanula zoysii, a previously unknown Carniolan flower.

He can play at either centre back or right back. He has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv, Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea, Manchester City, Sunderland, Portsmouth, West Ham United, Queens Park Rangers, Standard Liége and Charlton Athletic. Early life Ben-Haim was born in Rishon LeZion, Israel, to a Jewish family. Club careerMaccabi Tel Aviv= Born in Rishon LeZion, Ben Haim joined the Maccabi Tel Aviv senior squads in 1998 as a reserve player. His league debut came on 30 April 2001 when he came on in the 90th minute as a substitute in the Tel Aviv derby match against Hapoel. He played a significant part in Maccabi's Israeli Premier League title in the 2002–03 season, and was appointed club captain the following season, replacing Gadi Brumer who retired in mid-season. =Bolton Wanderers= Ben Haim playing for Bolton in November 2005 After a two-week trial with Bolton Wanderers in the summer of 2004, Sam Allardyce secured the services of Ben Haim on a three-year deal for a fee believed to be in the region of £150,000. Although Allardyce did not believe Ben Haim would be ready for the rigours of the Premier League immediately, he was confident that, given time, Ben Haim would have a big impact on the English game. His first season at the Reebok Stadium was a successful one as he made 27 appearances. On 1 February 2005, Ben Haim scored his first and only goal for Bolton, heading a free-kick from Stelios Giannakopoulos into the net in Bolton's 3–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. , this is his only goal in the Premier League. The only thing that hampered his campaign a little was a clash with Wayne Rooney in a league match when Rooney appeared to shove him in the face. Ben Haim, it was claimed, went down too easily and made too much of it and was charged with improper conduct by the Football Association, but was later cleared of charges. On 20 October 2005 while playing for Bolton in the UEFA Cup away at Beşiktaş, Ben Haim wore the captain's armband and was praised by the regular team captain Jay-Jay Okocha. In the second leg of the UEFA Cup Round of 32 against the French side Marseille which they drew 0–0 in the first leg, Ben Haim was the blame when he scored an own goal in the 69th minutes which turns out to be a winner for Marseille as the result was 2–1 on 23 February 2006. Ben Haim's defensive displays in his following seasons at Bolton had attracted the interests of many clubs including Chelsea, West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur. In January 2007, Chelsea confirmed that talks to sign Ben Haim from Bolton were unsuccessful. Following the end of the 2006–07 season, Ben Haim's contract with Bolton had expired and his future at Bolton was in doubt with media reports linking him with a move to Chelsea and Newcastle United, ex-Bolton boss Sam Allardyce admitting that he was ready to make an offer to his former charge to bring him to Newcastle. His transfer from Maccabi to Bolton in July 2004 is one of those about which the Stevens inquiry report in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the apparent conflict of interest between agent Craig Allardyce, his father Sam Allardyce – the then manager at Bolton – and the club itself. =Chelsea= In June 2007, Chelsea officially announced the signing of Ben Haim on a Bosman transfer after he had passed his medical at Stamford Bridge and agreed on personal terms to join the club on a four-year deal. Ben-Haim told the Jewish Telegraph exclusively: \\"I am very happy to join one of the greatest clubs in the world. I needed a new challenge. I will play in any position Jose Mourinho wants me to play. I am looking forward to starting the new season with Champions League football.\\" He made his competitive début for Chelsea against Manchester United in the FA Community Shield. With injuries to fellow Chelsea defenders John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho Ben Haim became a regular in the Chelsea first team. However, after the recovery of first team pairing Terry and Carvalho and the impressive form of Alex, Ben Haim found himself to be the fourth choice centre back. In April 2008, he criticized Chelsea manager Avram Grant after Chelsea's 1–1 draw with Wigan Athletic stating: \\"If I knew Avram Grant was going to be the coach I would have signed for another club. It was Jose who brought me here and no one except he and I know the conversation we had when he tried to sign me the first time a year ago last January. The fact is while Jose was the coach I played most of the games and people who know me know that I would not have come here to be a reserve. I knew nothing good would come for me with Grant as Chelsea coach.\\" In a press conference, Avram Grant responded: \\"I don't think José promised Ben Haim he will play before John Terry, Carvalho and Alex. It is internal business but, in my opinion, if a player was wrong we need to deal with it — in our way, my way.\\" Tal Ben Haim was fined two weeks wages, about £80,000. During Ben Haim's stay at Chelsea, he made 13 Premier League appearances, before transferring to Manchester City. =Manchester City= Ben Haim at Manchester City Ben Haim joined City on 30 July 2008 for a fee around £5 million, becoming only the second first-team signing of new manager Mark Hughes. He chose to wear the number 26 jersey, vacated by the transfer of Matthew Mills because, apart from his time at Chelsea where it was worn by John Terry, he had always worn that number at club level. After signing, Ben Haim said \\"I’m definitely going to give my best to City and give my heart in every game. I hope that we can do good things this season. I’m looking forward to starting the season here.\\" Ben Haim made his City debut in second leg of the UEFA Cup qualifier against EB/Streymur at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium on 31 July where City won 2–0. Ben Haim eventually made his league debut for Manchester City which he received a booking as Manchester City lost to Aston Villa 4–2 on 17 August 2008. He failed to establish himself as a first team regular, which saw him left on the substitutes bench for a long period of the season. After returning to the club, following a loan spell at Sunderland, it was clear that he was surplus to requirements at the City of Manchester Stadium. He was then transfer listed. =Sunderland (loan)= Ben Haim signed for Sunderland on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season on 1 February 2009. He made his debut away to Arsenal on 21 February and made his home debut at the Stadium of Light on 7 March against Tottenham Hotspur. He again found it difficult to break into the side. Ben-Haim was limited to only 5 appearances in a Sunderland shirt. At the end of the 2008–09 season, he returned to Manchester City. =Portsmouth= On 31 August 2009 it was announced that Portsmouth had signed Ben-Haim on a four-year deal. On 12 September 2009, Ben Haim made his league debut for the club in a 3–2 loss against his former club Bolton. Since then he has become one of the two first choice centre-backs under managers Paul Hart and his former manager at Chelsea, Avram Grant. He suffered an injury in the second half of the season, which kept him out of Portsmouth's FA Cup final game against Chelsea, which Pompey lost 1–0. On 20 December 2009 a match between Portsmouth and Liverpool which Portsmouth won 2–0, Ben Haim accused Liverpool striker Fernando Torres elbowing him during the match. In May 2010, after Portsmouth had been relegated, Ben Haim opted to stay at Portsmouth although he had a relegation-release clause in his contract but declined the chance to activate it. He played for just one season for Portsmouth and made 24 appearances for the club in all competitions. Ben Haim criticised the club's former owners as they prepared for life in the Championship the following season and the cash issues did play a significant role in the club's demise. As the 2010/11 Championship campaign for Portsmouth was set to start, the club's administrator Andrew Andronikou wanted Ben Haim's crippling salary off the club's wage bill. West Ham and an unnamed Greek club were interested in signing him. =West Ham United (loan)= Ben Haim at West Ham United, August 2010 In July 2010, Ben Haim was set to join his ex- Portsmouth manager, Avram Grant at West Ham United on a free transfer, but it was reported that the move had collapsed after Ben Haim had failed a medical and Ben Haim's rumoured wage demands of £38,000-a-week. On 2 August 2010, the Israeli press reported that Ben Haim had agreed terms with West Ham on a three-year deal after passing a medical with Ben Haim considering legal action against the reporter who had published reports about his failed medical. He joined West Ham on 3 August 2010 on loan until January 2011 with a view to a permanent deal. On 24 August 2010, Ben Haim played his first game for West Ham, against Oxford United in the League Cup, in a 1–0 victory and made his league debut for the club in a 3–1 loss against his former club Chelsea on 11 September 2010. On 1 January 2011 assisted Freddie Sears to score in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Four days later on 5 January 2011 he played for West Ham as they lost 5–0 to Newcastle United. This turned out his last appearance for West Ham. Despite his loan spell at West Ham having ended, the club continued talks with Portsmouth regarding a deal to bring Ben Haim back; the two clubs could not come to an agreement, while financial issues prevented him from linking up with Pompey. =Return to Portsmouth= In January 2011, Ben Haim returned to Portsmouth after his loan spell expired, but he did not make any appearances for Portsmouth that season, returning to training with the squad. He was in dispute with Portsmouth over £1.4million in unpaid wages. Because of this, manager Steve Cotterill was unable to select Ben Haim for the final fixtures of the 2010/11 season. The case was set to go to a Football League hearing in July 2011, but with new owners (CSI) installed at the club, Portsmouth were able to reach an acceptable agreement with Ben Haim. On 11 July, Ben Haim made his first appearance for Portsmouth since the 2009–10 season in a 4–0 pre-season win over Havant & Waterlooville. On 6 August 2011, Ben Haim made his first league appearance in a 2–2 draw against Middlesbrough. On 27 August 2011, Ben Haim provided an assist to allow Nwankwo Kanu to score to make it 1–1 against Welsh side Cardiff City and also provided another assist the following week for Greg Halford to score the third goal in the match as Portsmouth lost 4–3 to his former club, West Ham. Later on in the 2011/12 season, Portsmouth would go into administration for the second time in two years, bringing them an automatic 10-point deduction. An arrest warrant was issued for Vladimir Aleksandrovich Antonov and Portsmouth were issued a winding up petition by HMRC for over £1.6 million in unpaid taxes, which was heard on 20 February. The end of the 2011–12 season saw Portsmouth get relegated from the Championship, after which Ben Haim's agent, Pini Zahavi, stated that he would not play in League One despite having one year remaining on his deal, worth around £2 million. However, Zahavi later stated that he was in the dark over Ben Haim's future. Ben Haim's contract was criticized by administrator Trevor Birch because he was offered £36,000-a-week over four years, shortly before the club first went into liquidation. However, due to administration the maximum the club paid any player at that time was just £5,000-a-week. In response, Ben Haim refused to take a letter from a supporters group asking them to waive their wages and has suggested that the administrator takes a pay cut instead. He came to an agreement to leave the club in August 2012. =Queens Park Rangers= On 4 January 2013, Ben Haim joined Queens Park Rangers on a short-term contract deal. He made his debut the next day in an FA Cup match against West Bromwich Albion, where he provided an assist for a late equaliser from Kieron Dyer to make the result 1–1. On 9 May 2013, Canadian side Toronto FC of Major League Soccer announced they had acquired Ben Haim on loan from Queens Park Rangers. However, four days later, Toronto FC GM Kevin Payne said that Ben Haim never officially signed for the club as originally announced, and never ended up joining the team. He was released by Queens Park Rangers at the end of the 2012–13 season. He continued training with the club for a short time after his release however, and appeared in a pre-season friendly against Exeter City on 11 July 2013. =Standard Liège= On 24 July 2013, Ben Haim signed for Belgian side Standard Liège on a two-year contract, following his release from Queens Park Rangers. However, Ben Haim made ten appearance for the club after losing his first team place to Dino Arslanagic. =Charlton Athletic= On 11 July 2014, Ben Haim signed for Charlton Athletic on a one-year deal, with the Addicks becoming his eighth English club. Upon the move, Ben Haim was given number twenty-six shirt. Ben Haim started in the opening game of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Brentford. On 12 May 2015, Ben Haim was released at the end of his contract. =Return to Maccabi Tel Aviv= On 3 June 2015, Ben Haim signed a two-year contract with his former club and current Israeli champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. On 25 August, he qualified with Maccabi to the Champions League group stage after passing FC Basel in the Play-offs round. On 24 November 2015, Ben Haim was sent off in a 4–0 defeat by his former club Chelsea in the Champions League group stage. = Beitar Jerusalem F.C = on 7 August 2018, Ben Haim signed a two-year contract with Beitar Jerusalem F.C. He has since played 46 times for the club. on 7 August 2020, it was announced that the player has extended his contract with the club for one more year. International career Tal Ben Haim with Israel on 3 September 2015 Ben Haim made his debut for Israeli national squad on 13 February 2002 in a friendly match against Germany. He scored his first goal from a penalty in a 2–1 win against Latvia on 4 June 2011. Personal life He has exactly the same name as winger, Tal Ben Haim, who also played for Israel and Maccabi Tel Aviv, and he is referred to in UEFA reports as Tal Ben Haim I, while Tal Ben Haim II wears a jersey with his surname spelled as Ben Chaim to distinguish him from his fellow countryman.

Alexander was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry from Sandhurst. He joined the Commandos and later the Special Boat Service (SBS), a special forces unit that was created in 1940. The SBS was charged with a variety of classified tasks, including reconnaissance and sabotage. Alexander was promoted to Lieutenant in 1941. The capture Working for the SBS, Alexander was a 21 year old lieutenant (and temporary captain) stationed in Alexandria, Egypt during the summer of 1942. As Alexander later described the episode, he and 20 others were assigned a mission to blow up a munitions dump behind enemy lines. The group traveled 30-40 miles by torpedo boat from Alexandria, and then, under cover of darkness, took rubber boats ashore. As they landed, the area burst into light and activity; their landing point turned out to also be the headquarters for the German 90th Light Infantry Division, a crack unit of the Afrika Corps. While the other 20 men returned quietly to their torpedo boat, Alexander and a colleague, Corporal Peter Gurney, decided to stay behind and attempt the mission. Under cover of darkness, they were able to blow up a tank transporter, but after a two-day effort to get back to British territory, they were captured. Circumstances of the capture When captured, Alexander was wearing civilian clothes and an Afrika Corps hat. He was wearing civilian clothes (“silk shirt and gabardine trousers”) because he’d been called to re- do the same mission from earlier in the day, and so he’d rushed from the tennis courts back to his hotel in order to make it onto the torpedo boat. While walking amongst German encampments, he and a Gurney hadn’t brought food and water. On the morning of the second day, the two had entered a 6-person German tent in order to eat their breakfast (spaghetti bolognese and coffee); Alexander had taken one of their hats to protect against the heat. He’d also taken three of their pistols (“us Brits rather liked us the Luger pistol.”) They’d tied up the Germans rather than kill them, which had allowed one of Germans to escape and sound the alarm that led to their capture. And so, when captured, Alexander was in civilian clothes, was wearing a partial German uniform, and—-as he was informed by a “nice, Oxford-educated German officer”—-they would be charged with murder since the bombs that blew up the tank transporter had killed two soldiers sleeping inside. That German officer also told him that the Fuhrer had specifically ordered that “anyone playing commando games” should be shot immediately. This information overlapped with what they’d already understood, that the Germans regularly killed \\"saboteurs\\". Given this bleak situation, Gurney let on that Alexander was related to General Harold Alexander, who had recently arrived to command North Africa. Alexander played along with this false claim, gradually revealing that he was the general’s nephew. Gurney and Alexander recognized that the Germans might be willing to keep prominent prisoners alive so they could later be used as hostages. They were quickly evaluated by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and General Westphal, who decided on imprisonment rather than execution. Alexander and Gurney were sent to Talag, a prison in Berlin. From there, Alexander was transferred to Colditz Castle, a high security prison near Leipzig. Alexander was never able to identify what happened to Gurney after they were sent to Berlin together. Alexander later wrote that the idea that Gurney was “disposed of” in Berlin “haunts me.” Colditz Castle During WW II, Colditz primarily housed Allied officers who were considered dangerous or escape risks. Within Colditz, Alexander joined the Prominente, a group of 21 prisoners that included two nephews of King George VI and a nephew of Winston Churchill. Intended to be used as hostages, the Prominente were separated from other prisoners and provided with modestly better provisions. Release By 12 April 1945, as American gunfire could be heard in the distance, it became clear that the Allies were near victory. At that time, the Nazi head of POW’s Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger, a general of the Waffen-SS, informed the Prominente that Adolf Hitler had specifically requested that they be taken to the mountains where Hitler and some of his inner circle would be making their last side. At that point, Berger indicated that they would all be killed. Berger then informed these influential prisoners that he would not carry out the Fuhrer’s order. Instead, he loaded the Prominente into two trucks and had them driven to the Americans. At the Nuremberg Trials, Berger claimed a variety of mitigating behaviors for other war crimes; historians appear to not believe his claims aside from the Colditz release, though they do question Berger’s motivation to release relatives of England’s King and Prime Minister as the war was ending. Ultimately the general served 6 years for war crimes. Alexander was promoted Captain in 1946 and invalided out of the Army in 1951.

He gave DVDs to fans who correctly answered trivia questions. In 2012, he again appeared as the Soup Nazi while touring the United States with a Seinfeld food truck, allowing fans to pose with him and signing autographs. On July 5, 2014, he appeared at Brooklyn Cyclones as the Soup Nazi to celebrate Salute to Seinfeld Night, and threw out the first pitch. In 2015, he reprised his role as the Soup Nazi when Hulu opened \\"Seinfeld: The Apartment\\" in New York City, creating a real-world version of Jerry Seinfeld's Upper West Side apartment, complete with a show memorabilia gallery and interactive Seinfeld fan experience to mark the streaming debut of all episodes of the series on Hulu. In September 2018, Thomas appeared as the Soup Nazi for a surprise guest appearance at a wedding in Old Tappan, NJ. He announced the couple for the first time as husband and wife, and later took photos with their guests.

After founding and directing a college-preparatory school in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, Flexner published a critical assessment of the state of the American educational system in 1908 titled The American College: A Criticism. His work attracted the Carnegie Foundation to commission an in-depth evaluation into 155 medical schools in the US and Canada. It was his resultant self-titled Flexner Report, published in 1910, that sparked the reform of medical education in the United States and Canada. Flexner was also a founder of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, which brought together some of the greatest minds in history to collaborate on intellectual discovery and research. BiographyEarly life and education= Flexner was born in Louisville, Kentucky on November 13, 1866. He was the sixth of nine children born to German Jewish immigrants, Ester and Moritz Flexner.Abraham Flexner: An Autobiography, New York: SImon and Schuster, 1960, pp. 2–4. He was the first in his family to complete high school and go on to college. In 1886, at age 19, Flexner completed a B.A. in classics at Johns Hopkins University, where he studied for only two years. In 1905, he pursued graduate studies in psychology at Harvard University, and at the University of Berlin. He did not, however, complete work on an advanced degree at either institution. =Personal life= Flexner had three brothers named Jacob, Bernard and Simon Flexner. He also had a sister named Rachel Flexner. The success of Abraham Flexner's experimental schooling allowed him to help finance Simon Flexner's medical education at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He proceeded to become a pathologist, bacteriologist and a medical researcher employed by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1901 to 1935. Flexner circa 1895 Flexner also financed his sister's undergraduate studies at Bryn Mawr College. Jacob ran a drugstore and used the profits from selling the establishment to attend medical school. He then practiced as a physician in Louisville. Bernard pursued a career in law and later practiced in both Chicago and New York. In 1896, Flexner married a former student of his school, Anne Laziere Crawford. She was a teacher who soon became a successful playwright and children's author. The success of her play Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (based on the 1901 novel) funded Flexner's studies at Harvard and his year abroad at European universities. The couple had two daughters Jean and Eleanor. Jean went on to become one of the original employees of the United States Division of Labor Standards. Eleanor Flexner became an independent scholar and pioneer of women's studies. Flexner grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family, however, early on he became a religious agnostic. In addition to contributions by his brother Simon, their nephew, Louis Barkhouse Flexner, was founding director of the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and a former editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. =Death= Flexner died in Falls Church, Virginia, in 1959 at 92 years of age. He was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. CareerExperimental schooling= After graduating from Johns Hopkins University in two years with a degree in classics, Flexner returned to Louisville to teach classics at Louisville Male High School. Four years later, Flexner founded a private school in which he would test his growing ideas about education. Flexner opposed the standard model of education that focused on mental discipline and a rigid structure. Moreover, \\"Mr. Flexner's School\\" did not give out traditional grades, used no standard curriculum, refused to impose examinations on students, and kept no academic record of students. Instead, it promoted small learning groups, individual development, and a more hands-on approach to education. Graduates of his school were soon accepted at leading colleges, and his teaching style began to attract considerable attention. =The American College= In 1908, Flexner published his first book, The American College. Strongly critical of many aspects of American higher education, it denounced, in particular, the university lecture as a method of instruction. According to Flexner, lectures enabled colleges to \\"handle cheaply by wholesale a large body of students that would be otherwise unmanageable and thus give the lecturer time for research.\\" In addition, Flexner was concerned about the chaotic condition of the undergraduate curriculum and the influence of the research culture of the university. Neither contributed to the mission of the college to address the whole person. He feared that \\"research had largely appropriated the resources of the college, substituting the methods and interest of highly specialized investigation for the larger objects of college teaching.\\"Abraham Flexner, The American College, New York: The Century Company, 1908, pp. 215–216 His book attracted the attention of Henry Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation, who was looking for someone to lead a series of studies of professional education. The book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and the two soon arranged to meet through the then-president of Johns Hopkins University, Ira Remsen. Although Flexner had never set foot inside a medical school, he was Pritchett's first choice to lead a study of American medical education, and soon joined the research staff at the Carnegie Foundation in 1908. Although not a physician himself, Flexner was selected by Pritchett for his writing ability and his disdain for traditional education. =Flexner Report= In 1910, Flexner published the Flexner Report, which examined the state of American medical education and led to far-reaching reform in the training of doctors. The Flexner Report led to the closure of most rural medical schools and all but two African-American medical colleges in the United States, given his adherence to germ theory, in which he argued that if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans and the poor posed a health threat to middle/upper class European-Americans. His position was: Ironically, one of the schools, Louisville National Medical College, was located in Flexner's hometown. In response to the report, some schools fired senior faculty members in a process of reform and renewal.World J Surg. 2012 Mar;36(3):684–8 https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/32172 =Influence on Europe= Flexner soon conducted a related study of medical education in Europe. According to Bonner (2002), Flexner's work came to be \\"nearly as well known in Europe as in America.\\" With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Flexner \\"...exerted a decisive influence on the course of medical training and left an enduring mark on some of the nation's most renowned schools of medicine.\\" Bonner worried that \\"the imposition of rigid standards by accrediting groups was making the medical curriculum a monstrosity,\\" with medical students moving through it with \\"little time to stop, read, work or think.\\" Bonner (2002) calls Flexner \\"the severest critic and the best friend American medicine ever had.\\" =New Lincoln School= Between 1912 and 1925, Flexner served on the Rockefeller Foundation's General Education Board, and after 1917 was its secretary. With the help of the board, he founded another experimental school, the Lincoln School, which opened in 1917, in cooperation with the faculty at Teachers College of Columbia University. =Institute for Advanced Study= left to right: Albert Einstein, Abraham Flexner, John R. Hardin, and Herbert Maass at the Institute for Advanced Study on May 22, 1939 The Bambergers, heirs to a department store fortune, were set on creating a medical school in Newark, New Jersey that gave admissions preference to Jewish applicants in an effort to fight the rampant prejudice against Jews in the medical profession at that time. Flexner informed them that a teaching hospital and other faculties required a successful school. A few months later, in June 1930, he had persuaded the Bamberger siblings and their representatives to fund instead the development of an Institute for Advanced Study. The Institute was headed by Flexner from 1930 to 1939 and it possessed a renowned faculty including Kurt Gödel and John von Neumann. During his time there, Flexner helped bring over many European scientists who would likely have suffered persecution by the rising Nazi government. This included Albert Einstein, who arrived at the Institute in 1933 under Flexner's directorship. =Universities: American, English, German= In his 1930 Universities: American, English, German, Flexner returned to his earlier interest in the direction and purpose of the American university, attacking distractions from serious learning, such as intercollegiate athletics, student government, and other student activities. Legacy * The Flexner Report and his work in education has had a lasting impact on medical and higher education. The specific impacts of the Flexner Report on American and Canadian medicine include: ** Average physician quality has increased significantly ** Medicine has become a lucrative and well- respected profession ** A physician must receive at minimum six years, preferably eight years of post-secondary education, typically in a university setting ** Medical education is based on research, specifically in the fields of human physiology and biochemistry ** Medical research follows the same protocols as scientific research ** The state government must approve the founding of any medical school and medical schools are subject to state regulation ** The state branches of the American Medical Association oversee all the conventional medical schools in each state * The Institute for Advanced Study, which Flexner co-founded, has been conducting valuable research for over 80 years in attempt to understand the complexities of the physical world and humanity Honors *The Association of American Medical Colleges created the Abraham Flexner Award for Distinguished Service to Medical Education to annually recognize individuals who have made a notable contribution to American medical education. *The University of Kentucky College of Medicine created the Abraham Flexner Master Educator Awards to recognize achievement in six categories: ** Educational Leadership and Administration ** Outstanding Teaching Contribution or Mentorship ** Educational Innovation and Curriculum Development ** Educational Evaluation and Research ** Faculty Development in Education * Abraham Flexner Way in downtown Louisville's hospital district was named by the Louisville Board of Aldermen in November 1978 to honor Flexner.

He was born in Oreshak, the second of the two children of Nayden Minkov Rachev, but very little is known about his parents' background. He was educated only in his native mountain village of Oreshak but from his late childhood he became a novice monk in the Troyan Monastery and then studied Orthodox Theology at Sofia University.

The WKA was founded in 1971 and is located directly behind Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. The WKA is believed to currently have approximately 5,000 members. Over 50,000 people have been WKA members since the organization's inception in 1971. The WKA comprises five national touring series - the Bully Clutches Gold Cup for oval karts, Bridgestone/George Kugler Manufacturer's Cup driven by Mazda for sprint road course karts on asphalt, Vega Road Racing Series presented by Summit Racing Equipment, Briggs & Stratton Speedway Dirt and Rage Karts Speedway Pavement. The WKA sanctions a number of divisional series and tracks, mostly located throughout the eastern half of the United States.  Gold Cup Series  The Gold Cup Series is a four-race tour with races at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, G&J; Kartway in Camden, Ohio, New Castle Motorsports Park in Indiana and Pitt Race (Formerly BeaveRun) in Wampum, Pennsylvania. The series competes exclusively on sprint-style road courses and all classes are powered by Briggs & Stratton 4-cycle engines.  Manufacturer's Cup Series  The Manufacturer's Cup Series may be WKA's most popular and promotable series. Top American race drivers such as Jamie McMurray and A. J. Allmendinger occasionally compete in the series, which travels to locations such as Daytona International Speedway, Michiana Raceway Park in Indiana, Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, New Castle Motorsports Park in New Castle, Ind., Pitt Race (Formerly BeaverRun) in Wampum, Pennsylvania, GoPro Motorplex in Mooresville, North Carolina, and Charlotte Motor Speedway. Like the Gold Cup, the tracks are sprint-style road courses that are generally around 1 mile (1.6 km) in length. Contrary to Gold Cup, most classes are powered by faster, more powerful Two-stroke engine2-cycle engines (with the LO2O6 Four-stroke engine being the oddball). Yamaha, Micro Swift (called Mini Swift by officials) and Mini Swift (called Pro Swift Sportsman by officials) Cadet karts compete in the Man (Manufactures) Cup Series. Junior classes include another Yamaha class and the Junior and Senior IAME X30 classes. Racers from all over America, Barbados, Canada and even Brazil race in the Man Cup series.  Winter Cup Series  The WKA Winter Cup is similar to the Manufactures Cup, but with races in the southeast area, usually Florida. In the 2016-2017 Season the tracks ran were Daytona Motor Speedway (in the infield of the NASCAR track), Jacksonville, Florida (103rd Street Sports Complex) and Ocala Gran Prix. The race in Daytona counts for both Winter Cup and Manufactures Cup for the following year.  Road Racing Series  The Road Racing Series (formerly Enduro Series) is different from the other four WKA national touring series. Laydown-enduro and sprint-enduro karts are built specifically for enduro-style road racing. Enduro-style road races are not held on sprint-style courses, but longer road courses typically built for race cars that are between 1.5 and in length. Gearbox (shifter) karts and Touch-and-Go (TaG) sit-up style karts also compete at Road Racing events. It is not uncommon for 40 to 50 different classes to compete throughout the course of a Road Racing weekend. Unlike the other WKA series, road racing events are raced for a specific amount of time as opposed to number of laps. Sprint and sprint-enduro classes have 30-minute races and laydown-enduro style classes have 45-minute races. Through the mid-1980s, laydown-enduro races were 1 hour in length, hence the name \\"enduro,\\" short for endurance. Most drivers have a timer mounted on their kart so they know what stage the race is at and when the final lap will be. Again, unlike the other WKA series, road races begin from a Le Mans start. Most other WKA national series (except shifter karts) begin races with a rolling start. At road racing events, karts line up in a traditional \\"Le Mans\\" style starting formation. The race official/starter starts a timer when he or she puts the green flag up and holds the flag in the air until he waves it and the karts take off. Road racing starts - similar to endurance motorcycle racing and pre-1969 sports car events - are very exciting to witness and participate in. The speeds go-karts reach at Road Racing events is perhaps the most intriguing part of the WKA Road Racing Series. 250cc karts, which look like small Indy cars, and dual- engine enduro karts reach in excess of 130 mph (210 km/h). Most other 2-cycle classes can reach anywhere from 90 to 130 mph (130 to 210 km/h). Even four- cycle powered karts reach top speeds around 80 to 90 mph (130 to 145 km/h) at Road Racing events. WKA road racers have the opportunity to race on some of America's most historic and reputable road courses. In the 2014 racing season, the WKA National Road Racing Series visits Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, Virginia International Raceway, Putnam Park, Carolina Motorsports Park, Daytona International Speedway, Grattan Raceway, NCCAR, Summit Point Raceway, and New Jersey Motorsports Park. In the past the series has held events at almost every permanent roadracing facility in the U.S., including: Watkins Glen, Roebling Road Raceway, Pocono Raceway, Bryar Motosports Park, New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Gateway International Raceway, Indianapolis Raceway Park, Oak Hill Raceway, Hallet Oklahoma, Texas World Speedway, Road America, Blackhawk Farms, Rockingham speedway, Charlotte Motor Speedway (Lowe's), Nazareth Speedway, Barber Motorsports Park, and Road Atlanta. WKA road racers reside mostly in the midwest, southeastern, and eastern half of the country. WKA road racing is more popular where healthy divisional road racing clubs are located. Several of these strong regional clubs include the Southern Kart Club, Woodbridge Kart Club, and Dart Kart Club. The activity of roadracing karts peaked in the mid-1980s with some events reaching over 1000 entries at a national event. The participants in modern roadrace events are perhaps the most passionate about the sport. Many of these lifelong participants have been active in the sport for over 30 years.  Speedway Dirt and Speedway Pavement Series  The Speedway Dirt Series is one of two WKA national series that holds races exclusively on oval tracks. It is the only series that races on dirt tracks. The track sizes range between (approximately) one-eighth-mile to one-quarter-mile. The Speedway Dirt Series has been WKA's best attended series throughout the 2000s; although, recently entry numbers have dropped off due to a difficult economy and the WKA treating the dirt oval racers poorly. The series is a five-race tour in 2009. All races are held in the South - specifically Georgia and the Carolinas in 2009. The tour has traveled to Tennessee and Florida in past years. Most speedway dirt competitors reside in the South. The Speedway Pavement Series is the other WKA national series that competes on oval tracks. The series is a five-race tour in 2009, visiting New Castle, Ind., Chapel Hill Raceway in Humphrey, New York, Riverhead Raceway on Long Island, OCR Action Sports Track in Rougemont, North Carolina, and BeaverRun (now Pittrace) in Wampum, Pa. Contrary to the Dirt Series, Speedway Pavement races are held on asphalt tracks. While Speedway Dirt teams are located mostly in the South, many Speedway Pavement teams are located in the Northeast. The Southeast also is well represented with Pavement teams. Speedway Dirt and Pavement racers drive karts built specifically for oval- track kart racing. Unlike sprint-style and enduro-style karts in which the driver sits in the center of the chassis, oval-track karts feature an extreme left driver offset for a high percentage of left-side weight which greatly helps handling on an oval track. Engines are on the right of the kart - reasoning being that the driver weighs more than the engine. This is contrary to race cars, which the engine would greatly outweigh the driver and the oval- kart driver offset theory would not work. All classes in Speedway Dirt and Pavement are powered by Briggs & Stratton 4-cycle engines. This has not always been true, however. 2-cycle engines (Yamahas and others) were once fairly popular on the Dirt tour.

He was Director of the Hiroshima Communications Hospital and lived near the hospital, about a mile from the explosion's center. A 1984 editorial in the Journal of American Medical Association, indicates \\"At the urging of friends, Dr. Hachiya first published his diary in a small Japanese-language medical journal (Teishin Igaku) that circulated among medical members of the Japanese communications services. There it came to the attention of Warner Wells, MD, an American physician who was working in Japan in 1950 as a surgical consultant to the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission.\\" It was Dr. Wells, who in consultation with Dr. Hachiya, made the diary to be published in 1955, under the name of Hiroshima Diary. During, and post bombing life Hachiya's diary cover the period from Aug. 6, 1945 to Sept. 30, 1945. He described the effects of the atomic bomb blast from its first flash in the early morning as he rested from his night shift as an air warden at the hospital. The force of the blast stripped all the clothes from his body but he and his wife survived, however they both received serious burns to their bodies and had to journey to the hospital Michihiko worked at. When Michihiko returned to the hospital that he worked in, the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, he spent the night in the care of the hospital staff who were not seriously injured. After his injuries healed, Michihiko started making his daily rounds that he would have normally made as a doctor. The staff and patients at the hospital call the atomic bomb that hit their city \\"pikadon\\". Pika describes a flash of light and don describes an explosive sound. As time passes an understanding of what hit their city clears up, and historical events such as the surrender of Japan are brought up. The condition of the hospital also drastically improves as more medical supplies are brought into the city, allowing them to better treat patients. After the bombing he wrote the book The Hiroshima Diary. This book describes what happened to him and what he saw.

Signs and symptoms often include fever and cough of relatively rapid onset. Complications may include lung abscess. Some include chemical induced inflammation of the lungs as a subtype, which occurs from acidic but non- infectious stomach contents entering the lungs. Infection can be due to a variety of bacteria. Risk factors include decreased level of consciousness, problems with swallowing, alcoholism, tube feeding, and poor oral health. Diagnosis is typically based on the presenting history, symptoms, chest X-ray, and sputum culture. Differentiating from other types of pneumonia may be difficult. Treatment is typically with antibiotics such as clindamycin, meropenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, or moxifloxacin. For those with only chemical pneumonitis, antibiotics are not typically required. Among people hospitalized with pneumonia, about 10% are due to aspiration. It occurs more often in older people, especially those in nursing homes. Both sexes are equally affected. Signs and symptoms The person may have an insidious course with increased respiratory rate, foul-smelling sputum, hemoptysis, and fever. Complications may occur, such as exudative pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscesses. If left untreated, aspiration pneumonia can progress to form a lung abscess. Another possible complication is an empyema, in which pus collects inside the lungs. If continual aspiration occurs, the chronic inflammation can cause compensatory thickening of the insides of the lungs, resulting in bronchiectasis. Causes Aspiration pneumonia is often caused by a defective swallowing mechanism, such as a neurological disease or as the result of an injury that directly impairs swallowing or interferes with consciousness. Impaired consciousness can be intentional, such as the use of general anesthesia for surgery. For many types of surgical operations, people preparing for surgery are therefore instructed to take nothing by mouth (nil per os, abbreviated as NPO) for at least four hours before surgery. These conditions enable the entry of bacteria into the lungs, thus allowing the development of an infection. =Risk factors= * Impaired swallowing: Conditions that cause dysphagia worsen the ability of people to swallow, causing an increased risk of entry of particles from the stomach or mouth into the airways. While swallowing dysfunction is associated with aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia may not be sufficient unless other risk factors are present. Neurologic conditions that can directly impact the nerves involved in the swallow mechanism include stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Anatomical changes in the chest can also disrupt the swallow mechanism. For example, patients with advanced COPD tend to develop enlarged lungs, resulting in compression of the esophagus and thus regurgitation. * Altered mental status: Changes in levels of consciousness affect the swallow mechanism by both disabling the body's natural protective measures against aspiration as well as possibly causing nausea and vomiting. Altered mental status can be caused by medical conditions such as seizures. However, many other agents can be responsible as well, including general anesthesia and alcohol. * Bacterial colonization: Poor oral hygiene can result in colonization of the mouth with excessive amounts of bacteria, which is linked to increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia. * Ethnicity: Asians diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia have a lower risk of death compared to other ethnic groups while African Americans and whites share a relatively similar risk of death. Hispanics have a lower risk of death than non-Hispanics. * Others: Age, male gender, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, use of antipsychotic drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Residence in an institutional setting, prolonged hospitalization or surgical procedures, gastric tube feeding, mechanical airway interventions, immunocompromised, history of smoking, antibiotic therapy, advanced age, reduced pulmonary clearance, diminished cough reflex, disrupted normal mucosal barrier, impaired mucociliary clearance, alter cellular and humoral immunity, obstruction of the airways, and damaged lung tissue. =Bacteria= Bacteria involved in aspiration pneumonia may be either aerobic or anaerobic. Common aerobic bacteria involved include: *Streptococcus pneumoniae *Staphylococcus aureus *Haemophilus influenzae *Pseudomonas aeruginosa * Klebsiella: often seen in aspiration lobar pneumonia in alcoholics Anaerobic bacteria also play a key role in the pathogenesis of aspiration pneumonia. They make up the majority of normal oral flora and the presence of putrid fluid in the lungs is highly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia secondary to an anaerobic organism. While it is difficult to confirm the presence of anaerobes through cultures, the treatment of aspiration pneumonia typically includes anaerobic coverage regardless. Potential anaerobic bacteria are as follows: *BacteroidesTable 13-7 in: *Prevotella *Fusobacterium *Peptostreptococcus  Pathophysiology  Aspiration is defined as inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the pulmonary tree. Depending on the composition of the aspirate, three complications have been described: * Chemical pneumonitis may develop whose severity depends on the pH value and quantity of aspirate. The two lung changes after acid aspiration are: a) direct toxic damage to the respiratory epithelium resulting in interstitial pulmonary edema and b) a few hours later, inflammatory response with production of cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and macrophage activation. Oxygen-free radicals are generated which, in turn, lead to further lung damage. Patients may remain asymptomatic after acid aspiration. Others may develop dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever, bloody or frothy sputum, and respiratory failure. * Aspiration pneumonia may develop. * The third complication occurs after inhalation of particulate matter that obstructs airways. The patients will have sudden arterial hypoxemia with development of lung atelectasis. =Location= The location is often gravity dependent, and depends on the person's position. Generally, the right middle and lower lung lobes are the most common sites affected, due to the larger caliber and more vertical orientation of the right mainstem bronchus. People who aspirate while standing can have bilateral lower lung lobe infiltrates. The right upper lobe is a common area of consolidation, where liquids accumulate in a particular region of the lung, in alcoholics who aspirate in the supine position. Diagnosis Aspiration pneumonia in a ventilated person with a central line and nasogastric tube Evaluation of aspiration is generally performed with a video fluoroscopic swallowing study involving radiologic evaluation of the swallowing mechanism via challenges with liquid and solid food consistencies. These studies allow for evaluation of penetration to the vocal folds and below but are not a sensitive and specific marker for aspiration. Additionally, it is difficult to distinguish between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis. Aspiration pneumonia is typically diagnosed by a combination of clinical circumstances (people with risk factors for aspiration) and radiologic findings (an infiltrate in the proper location). A chest x-ray is typically performed in cases where any pneumonia is suspected, including aspiration pneumonia. Findings on chest x-ray supportive of aspiration pneumonia include localized consolidation depending on the patient's position when the aspiration occurred. For example, people that are supine when they aspirate often develop consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung. Sputum cultures are not used for diagnosing aspiration pneumonia because of the high risk of contamination. Clinical symptoms may also increase suspicion of aspiration pneumonia, including new difficulty breathing and fever after an aspiration event. Likewise, physical exam findings such as altered breath sounds heard in the affected lung fields may also be suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. Some cases of aspiration pneumonia are caused by aspiration of food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments; these can be diagnosed by pathologists on lung biopsy specimens. While aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis may appear similar, it is important to differentiate between the two due to major differences in management of these conditions. Chemical pneumonitis is caused by damage to the inner layer of lung tissue, which triggers an influx of fluid. The inflammation caused by this reaction can rapidly cause similar findings seen in aspiration pneumonia, such as an elevated WBC (white blood cell) count, radiologic findings, and fever. However, it is important to note that the findings of chemical pneumonitis are triggered by inflammation not caused by infection, as seen in aspiration pneumonia. Inflammation is the body's immune response to any perceived threat to the body. Thus, treatment of chemical pneumonitis typically involves removal of the inflammatory fluid and supportive measures, notably excluding antibiotics. The use of antimicrobials is reserved for chemical pneumonitis complicated by secondary bacterial infection.  Prevention  There have been several practices associated with decreased incidence and decreased severity of aspiration pneumonia as detailed below. = Oral hygiene = Studies showed that the net reduction of oral bacteria was associated with a decrease in both incidence of aspiration pneumonia as well as mortality from aspiration pneumonia. One broad method of decreasing the number of bacteria in the mouth involves the use of antimicrobials, ranging from topical antibiotics to intravenous antibiotic use. Whereas the use of antibiotics focuses on destroying and hindering the growth of bacteria, mechanical removal of oral bacteria by a dental professional also plays a key role in reducing the bacterial burden. By reducing the amount of bacteria in the mouth, the likelihood of infection when aspiration occurs is reduced as well. For people who are critically ill that require a feeding tube, there is evidence suggesting that the risk of aspiration pneumonia may be reduced by inserting the feeding tube into the duodenum or the jejunum (post-pyloric feeding), when compared to inserting the feeding tube into the stomach (gastric feeding). = Enhanced swallow = Many people at risk for aspiration pneumonia have an impaired swallowing mechanism, which may increase the chance of aspiration of food particles with meals. There is some evidence to indicate that training of various parts of the body involved in the act of swallowing, including the tongue and lips, may reduce episodes of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia; however, further research is required to confirm this benefit. Other simple actions during feeding can improve the swallowing capability of a person and thus reduce the risk of aspiration, including changes in position and feeding assistance. = After surgery = Many instances of aspiration occur during surgical operations, especially during anesthesia induction. The administration of anesthesia causes suppression of protective reflexes, most importantly the gag reflex. As a result, stomach particles can easily enter the lungs. Certain risk factors predispose individuals to aspiration, especially conditions causing dysfunction of the upper gastrointestinal system. Identifying these conditions before the operation begins is essential for proper preparation during the procedure. It is recommended that patients fast prior to procedures as well. Other practices that may be beneficial but have not been well-studied include medication that reduce the acidity of gastric contents and rapid sequence induction. On the other hand, regarding reducing acidity of the stomach, an acid environment is needed to kill the organisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract; agents, such as proton pump inhibitors, that decrease the acidity of the stomach, may favor the growth of bacteria and increase the risk of pneumonia.  Treatment  The main treatment of aspiration pneumonia revolves around the use of antibiotics to remove the bacteria causing the infection. Broad antibiotic coverage is required to account for the diverse types of bacteria possibly causing the infection. Currently recommended antibiotics include clindamycin, meropenem, ertapenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, and moxifloxacin. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem is recommended in cases of potential antibiotic resistance. The typical duration of antibiotic therapy is about 5 to 7 days. If there is a large accumulation of fluid within the lungs, drainage of the fluid may also aid in the healing process.  Prognosis  Dysphagia clinicians often recommend alteration of dietary regimens, altered head positioning, or removal of all oral intake. While studies have suggested that thickening liquids can decrease aspiration through slowed pharyngeal transit time, they have also demonstrated increased pharyngeal residues with risk for delayed aspiration. The ability of clinical interventions to reduce pneumonia incidence is relatively unknown. Dietary modifications or nothing- by-mouth status also have no effect on a patient's ability to handle their own secretions. A patient's individual vigor may impact the development of pulmonary infections more than aspiration. Also increased pneumonia risk exists in patients with esophageal dysphagia when compared to stroke patients because patients with stroke will improve as they recover from their acute injury, whereas esophageal dysphagia is likely to worsen with time. In one cohort of aspiration pneumonia patients, overall three-year mortality was 40%. Studies have shown that aspiration pneumonia has been associated with an overall increased in-hospital mortality as compared with other forms of pneumonia. Further studies investigating differing time spans including 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. Individuals diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia were also at increased risk of developing future episodes of pneumonia. In fact, these individuals were also found to be at higher risk for readmission after being discharged from the hospital. Lastly, one study found that individuals diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia were more likely to fail treatment compared to other types of pneumonia. Elderly Aging increases the risk of dysphagia. The prevalence of dysphagia in nursing homes is approximately 50%, and 30% of the elderly with dysphagia develop aspiration. For individuals older than 75, the risk of pneumonia due to dysphagia, is six times greater than those 65. Owing to multiple factors, such as frailty, impaired efficacy of swallowing, decreased cough reflex and neurological complications, dysphagia can be considered as a geriatric syndrome. Atypical presentation is common in the elderly. Older patients may have impaired T cell function and hence, they may be unable to mount a febrile response. The mucociliary clearance of older people is also impaired, resulting in diminished sputum production and cough. Therefore, they can present non-specifically with different geriatric syndromes. =Microaspirations= In the elderly, dysphagia is a significant risk factor for the development of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia most often develops due to micro-aspiration of saliva, or bacteria carried on food and liquids, in combination with impaired host immune function. Chronic inflammation of the lungs is a key feature in aspiration pneumonia in elderly nursing home residents and presents as a sporadic fever (one day per week for several months). Radiological review shows chronic inflammation in the consolidated lung tissue, linking chronic micro-aspiration and chronic lung inflammation. =Choking= After falls, choking on food presents as the second highest cause of preventable death in aged care. Although food choking risk is commonly associated with young children, data shows that individuals over 65 years of age have a choking incidence that is seven times higher than children aged 1–4 years. =Parkinson's disease= The reported prevalence of dysphagia in patients with Parkinson's disease ranges from 20% to 100% due to variations in the methods of assessing the swallowing function. Unlike some medical problems, such as stroke, dysphagia in Parkinson's Disease degenerates with disease progression. Aspiration pneumonia was the most common reason for the emergency admission of patients with Parkinson's Disease whose disease duration was >5 years and pneumonia was one of the main causes of death. =Dementia= The familiar model of care for people with advanced dementia and dysphagia is the revolving door of recurrent chest infections, frequently associated with aspiration and related readmissions. Many individuals with dementia resist or are indifferent to food and fail to manage the food bolus. There are also many contributory factors such as poor oral hygiene, high dependency levels for being positioned and fed, as well as the need for oral suctioning. While tube feeding might therefore be considered a safer option, tube feeding has not been shown to be beneficial in people with advanced dementia. The preferred option therefore is to continue eating and drinking orally despite the risk of developing chest infections.

This snake is infamous for being an invasive species responsible for extirpating the majority of the native bird population in Guam. It is also one of the very few colubrids found in Australia, where elapids are more common. Diet The brown tree snake preys upon birds, lizards, bats, and rats and other small rodents in its native range. It preys on birds and shrews in Guam.Pianka, Eric R.; King, Dennis; King, Ruth Allen. (2004). Varanoid Lizards of the World. Indiana University Press, 588 pages Owing to the availability of prey and lack of predators in introduced habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft) in length. The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam measuring 3 m (9.8 ft). Reproduction The reproductive characteristics of the brown tree snake have not been widely studied. The female is known to produce four to 12 oblong eggs, long and wide with leathery shells. Females may produce up to two clutches per year depending upon seasonal variations in climate and prey abundance. The female deposits the eggs in hollow logs, rock crevices, and other sites where they are likely protected from drying and high temperatures. Populations on Guam may reproduce year round. Venom Invasive species on Guam The brown tree snake is a nocturnal, rear-fanged colubrid, possessing two small, grooved fangs at the rear of the mouth. Due to the placement of the fangs and their grooved rather than hollow architecture, the venom is difficult to convey into a bite on a human, and thus is only delivered in small doses. The venom appears to be weakly neurotoxic and possibly cytotoxic with localized effects that are trivial for adult humans; serious medical consequences have been limited to children, who are more susceptible because of their low body mass. The snake has been reported as aggressive, but is not considered dangerous to an adult human. The venom seems to be primarily used to subdue lizards, which can be more easily positioned in the rear of the mouth for venom delivery. Brown tree snake, Queensland, in characteristic \\"S-posture\\" Brown tree snake on a fence post on Guam Invasive species left Shortly after World War II, and before 1952, the brown tree snake was accidentally transported from its native range in the South Pacific to Guam, probably as a stowaway in ship cargo or by crawling into the landing gear of Guam-bound aircraft. As a result of abundant prey resources on Guam and the absence of natural predators apart from feral pigs and mangrove monitors, brown tree snake populations reached unprecedented numbers. Snakes caused the extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species; thousands of power outages affecting private, commercial, and military activities; widespread loss of domestic birds and pets; and considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when snakes invaded human habitats with the potential for envenomation of small children. Since Guam is a major transportation hub in the Pacific, numerous opportunities exist for the brown tree snakes on Guam to be introduced accidentally to other Pacific islands as passive stowaways in ship and air traffic from Guam. To minimize this threat, trained dogs are used to search, locate, and remove brown tree snakes before outbound military and commercial cargo and transportation vessels leave the island. Numerous sightings of this species have been reported on other islands including Wake Island, Tinian, Rota, Okinawa, Diego Garcia, Hawaii, and even Texas in the continental United States. Hawaii is especially at heavy risk from the snake, as direct military flights between Guam and Hawaii are allowed and brown tree snakes are regularly intercepted at landing areas. A successful introduction could pose an immense threat to the already highly threatened endemic birds of the islands. An incipient population is probably established on Saipan. Acetaminophen has been used to help eradicate the snake on Guam. = Underlying biology = General characteristics  The brown tree snake is a nocturnal, arboreal species that uses visual and chemical cues in hunting in the tropical rainforest canopy and/or on the ground. It is a member of the subfamily Colubrinae, genus Boiga, which is a group of roughly twenty five species that are referred to as \\"cat-eyed\\" snakes for their vertical pupils. The brown tree snake is generally 1–2 m (3–6 ft) in length in its native range. The snake is long and slender, which facilitates its climbing ability and allows it to pass through tiny spaces in buildings, logs, and other shaded locations, where it seeks refuge during daylight. Variations in coloration occur in the snake's native range, ranging from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish/green or even beige with red, saddle-shaped blotches. They are rear-fanged, have a large head in relation to their body, and can survive for extended periods of time without food.  Predatory behaviour  The brown tree snake is a generalist feeder known to eat a wide variety of foods, when threatened is highly aggressive and tends to lunge and strike the aggressor repeatedly. The snake has numerous teeth, but only the last two on each side of the upper jaw have grooves, which inject venom as it bites. Therefore, the snake's mouth must be opened as wide as possible to insert and expose its fangs. A chewing movement is used by the snake to inject the venom by means of capillary action along the grooved fangs. The venom is used to subdue and kill prey on which the snake feeds; however, the venom is not considered dangerous to adult humans. In addition to subduing its victim with its venom, the brown tree snake often wraps its body around the prey, like a constrictor, to immobilize the prey while chewing and consuming the animal.  Native habitat  The brown tree snake is native to coastal Australia, Papua New Guinea, and many islands in northwestern Melanesia. The species occurs on variably sized islands, extending from Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia through Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands and into the wettest coastal areas of Northern Australia. The snakes on Guam represent the only documented reproductive population outside the native range. Since January 2016, however, four snakes have been sighted on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands.  Current habitats  The brown tree snake is not restricted to forested habitats, as it can also occur in grasslands and sparsely forested areas, as well. In Papua New Guinea, it occupies a wide variety of habitats at elevations up to 1,200 m. It is most commonly found in trees, caves, and near limestone cliffs, but frequently comes down to the ground to forage at night. It hides during the day in the crowns of palm trees, hollow logs, rock crevices, caves, and even the dark corners of thatched houses near the roof. Based on the frequency of sightings of this snake, in relation to buildings, poultry, and caged birds, the snake is considered to be common in human- disturbed habitats.  Physiological evidence for reproductive suppression  Environmental stressors such as lack of shelter, climate change, overcrowding, and loss of prey have been researched as primary causes of diminished snake density, as they have been found to have direct correlation with the reproductive success of the snake. Current research on the breeding patterns of the brown tree snake is being conducted in hopes of further understanding how these environmental stressors are affecting the population density of the snake on Guam. A study conducted by I.T. Moore predicted that low body condition would correlate to high levels of stress hormones and low levels of sex steroids in free-living brown tree snakes on Guam when compared with the native snake population in Australia and snakes held in captivity on Guam. After extensive research, the body condition in the free-living snakes was found to be significantly different from the body condition of native and captive snakes. The results determined, \\"depressed body condition and elevated plasmacorticosteron levels in the free-living animals suggest that a lack of food resources was placing individuals under chronic stress, resulting in suppression of the reproductive system.\\" The study suggested that snakes living under stressful conditions such as high population densities or low prey resources had suppressed reproduction at multiple stages, including steroidogenesis and gametogenesis.  Current status  Currently, the brown tree snake population on Guam is declining with an equilibrium population size predicted to be roughly 30 to 50 snakes per hectare (12-20 per acre). The decline in snake population may be identified as a result of depleted food resources, adult mortality, and/or suppressed reproduction. The brown tree snake population on Guam has exceeded the carrying capacity of the island. = Species status and effect = Boiga irregularis from Washington DC Zoo  Effect of early introduction  The introduction of the brown tree snake on Guam after WWII has had a significant impact on the community dynamics of the island. Upon its introduction the brown tree snake population exploded and spread across the entirety of Guam. The brown tree snake population on the island has reached peak densities of greater than 100 snakes per hectare. This population spike was caused by the copious amount of resources newly available to the brown tree snake upon its introduction. The limitations on the snake's population in its native range is predominantly food based. The snake's food source is far more limited in its native range than on the island of Guam as the prey in its natural range boasts significantly more natural defences to the snake than the prey on Guam. The predominant population affected by the snake's introduction was that of native bird species such as the Mariana fruit dove, the Guam flycatcher, the rufous fantail and the Micronesian myzomela. The introduction of the brown tree snake into Guam has resulted in extinction of twelve native bird species in total. The Guam National Wildlife Refuge is attempting to prevent the extinction of additional bird species endangered by the snake. Other species significantly affected by the invasion of these snakes were small lizards and small mammals. Research has indicated a direct correlation of the spread of these snakes across the island to the decrease in the populations of these native species. Furthermore, the introduction of the brown tree snake has had an indirect, negative impact on vegetative diversity as its intense predatory nature has decreased populations of vital pollinators including native birds and fruit bats. Data collected from nearby islands lacking brown tree snake populations depict a significant difference in vegetative species richness, that is, islands close to and similar to Guam in which the brown tree snake has not been introduced have greater vegetative species diversity. Overall, the vertebrate fauna and native flora of Guam have suffered tremendously because of the introduction of the brown tree snake. =Population control methods= Capturing and poisoning methods  Biodegradable aerial bait cartridges consisting each of a dead mouse and 80-mg acetaminophen tablets, designed to catch on trees in areas where brown tree snakes are invasive Given the environmental impact of the brown tree snake, studies have attempted to provide a capturing methodology to alleviate the detrimental effects of the tree snake. The use of mice as bait has shown considerable reduction effects when combined with acetaminophen, to which the snake is particularly sensitive, in a mark-recapture experiment leading to potential widespread application in Guam. When utilizing a precisely defined treated plot with results corrected for immigration and emigration, the additive effect of both acetaminophen and mice usage shows a 0% survival rate of the brown tree snake. In the study, 80 mg of acetaminophen was inserted into mouse carcasses. In addition, one study showed that increasing inter-trap spacing would not only increase efficiency, but also not compromise efficacy as 20-, 30-, and 40-meter long perimeter trap lines were compared and no difference was found. Another study echoed the aforementioned notion of increasing inter-trap spacing.  Predation on brown tree snakes  An investigative study was performed to find predators of the brown tree snake that could possibly serve as a population control method. In this study two actual predators were identified and 55 potential predators were identified: the two actual predators identified were the red-bellied black snake and the cane toad. Actual predators were identified by evidence showing that they would actually prey upon and consume the brown tree snake in a natural habitat whereas potential predators were identified as species that were only physically capable of consuming the brown tree snake. The research collected in this study suggested that even with the introduction of brown tree snake predation, it was unlikely this would serve as an effective brown tree snake population control method. One reason for this conclusion was that the identified actual predators of the brown tree snake are generalist feeders and would cause further detriment to other native island species. Another possible negative outcome of introducing species as a control method for the brown tree snake population is predation on juvenile cane toads and red-bellied snakes by brown tree snakes themselves, because they are opportunistic and generalist feeders. This investigation determined that the environmental and ecological risk associated with the introduction of these predators was too high to implement. Lastly, red-bellied snakes could pose a threat to the health of humans. The cost of introduction of such predatory species outweighs the benefits and is not practical.

It is located in the southwest of Papua New Guinea and Papua Province of Indonesia. It rises in the Victor Emanuel Range arm of the Star Mountains, and crosses the south-western lowlands before flowing into the Gulf of Papua in a large delta. The Fly - Strickland River system has a total length of . Description The Fly flows mostly through the Western Province of Papua New Guinea and for a small stretch, it forms the international boundary with western New Guinea. This section protrudes slightly to the west of the 141°E longitude line. To compensate for this slight gain in territory for Papua New Guinea, the border south of the Fly River is slightly east of the 141°E longitude line. As part of this deal, Indonesia has the right to use the Fly River to its mouth for navigation. The principal tributaries of the Fly are the Strickland and the Ok Tedi. Close to its mouth, the flow of the Fly River encounters a tidal bore, where an incoming high tide pushes water upstream until the tide changes. The range of this tidal bore is still undocumented.p.159, Barrie R. Bolton. 2009. The Fly River, Papua New Guinea: Environmental Studies in an Impacted Tropical River System. Elsevier Science. .  Delta  The original survey map created by L.M. D'Albertis in 1876 The delta of the Fly River is over 100 km wide at its entrance, but only 11 km wide at the apex upstream of Kiwai Island. The delta contains 3 main distributary channels (the Southern, Northern, and Far Northern Entrances) that branch from a common point (the “apex”). The distributary channels are 5 to 15m in depth, separated by elongate, sand-mud islands that are stabilised by lush mangrove vegetation. The islands are eroded and rebuilt rapidly in the apex area, where they have lateral migration rates of up to 150 m/a, with slower rates for the more seaward islands. Upstream from the apex the river gradually narrows to a width of 1.6 km or less. The Fly Delta exhibits a distinctive funnel shape in plan view, attesting to the fundamental role of tidal currents in shaping the Delta's geomorphology. Mean spring tidal ranges are amplified within the delta, from around 3.5m at the seaward entrance of the distributary channels, reaching a peak of about 5m at the delta apex.Harris, P.T., Baker, E.K., Cole, A.R., Short, S.A., 1993. A preliminary study of sedimentation in the tidally dominated Fly River Delta, Gulf of Papua. Continental Shelf Research 13, 441-472.

Coconut palm, breadfruit, plantain, sago palm, and sugar cane are grown.  Fly River Turtle  The Fly River turtle, also known as the Pig-Nosed turtle due to its odd nose, are notably different from other turtles due to their piglike nose. The only freshwater turtle to have flippers, the turtle is known to rarely leave water, except in dire circumstances. They are also known to be omnivores whom rarely consume meat.  History  The Fly was first discovered by Europeans in 1845 when Francis Blackwood, commanding the corvette HMS Fly, surveyed the western coast of the Gulf of Papua. The river was named after his ship and he proclaimed that it would be possible for a small steam-powered boat to travel up the mighty river. In 1876, Italian explorer, Luigi D'Albertis, was the first person to successfully attempt this when he travelled 900 km into the interior of New Guinea, in his steamer, Neva. It was the furthest any European explorer had ever been into the island. Environmental issues Both the Strickland and the Ok Tedi Rivers have been the source of environmental controversy due to tailings waste from the Porgera Mine and the Ok Tedi Mine, respectively. Sediment sampling and coring in the distributary channels of the Fly Delta had not detected copper concentrations significantly higher than background as of 1994.Harris, P.T., 2001.

The Cimarron River () extends across New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas. The headwaters flow from Johnson Mesa west of Folsom in northeastern New Mexico. Much of the river's length lies in Oklahoma, where it either borders or passes through eleven counties. There are no major cities along its route. The river enters the Oklahoma Panhandle near Kenton, Oklahoma, crosses the southeastern corner of Colorado into Kansas, reenters the Oklahoma Panhandle, reenters Kansas, and finally returns to Oklahoma where it joins the Arkansas River at Keystone Reservoir west of Tulsa, Oklahoma, its only impoundment. The Cimarron drains a basin that encompasses about .Larry O'Dell, \\"Cimarron River,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed March 6, 2015. Etymology The river's present name comes from the early Spanish name, Río de los Carneros Cimarrón, which is usually translated as River of the Wild Sheep including Grand Saline, Jefferson (in John Melish's 1820 U.S. map), Red Fork, Salt Fork name=\\"EOHC-CimarronRiver\\"/> Description In northeastern New Mexico and in far western Oklahoma, the river is known as the Dry Cimarron River. The Dry Cimarron is not completely dry, but sometimes its water entirely disappears under the sand in the river bed. The Dry Cimarron Scenic Byway follows the river from Folsom to the Oklahoma border. The waterway becomes simply the Cimarron River after being joined by Corrizozo Creek just inside the Oklahoma border, west of Kenton, Oklahoma. Carrizozo Creek also originates in New Mexico and exits into Oklahoma before re-entering New Mexico and then returning to Oklahoma before joining the river. In Oklahoma it is further joined by North Carrizo Creek north-northeast of Kenton, Tesesquite Creek further to the east of Kenton, and South Carrizo Creek yet further to the east. It additionally joins with Cold Springs Creek, Ute Canyon Creek, and Flagg Springs Creek before crossing into Kansas. The river flows along the southern edges of Black Mesa, Oklahoma's highest point. As it first crosses the Kansas border, the river flows through the Cimarron National Grassland. The Cimarron's water quality is rated as poor because the river flows through natural mineral deposits, salt plains, and saline springs, where it dissolves large amounts of minerals. It also collects quantities of red soil, which it carries to its terminus. Before the Keystone Dam was built, this silt was sufficient to discolor the Arkansas River downstream. =Early explorers= The first Europeans to see the Cimarron River were apparently Spanish conquistadores led by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541. The Spanish seem to have done little to exploit the area. The Osage tribe claimed most of the territory west of the confluence of the Cimarron and the Arkansas. In 1819 Thomas Nuttall explored the lower Cimarron and wrote a report describing the flora and fauna that he found there. In 1821 Mexico threw off Spanish rule and William Becknell opened the Santa Fe Trail. Cimarron River near Guthrie, Oklahoma at flood stage. Photo provided by National Weather Service. =Historical notes of interest= *One branch of the Santa Fe Trail, known variously as the Cimarron Route, the Cimarron Cutoff, and the Middle Crossing (of the Arkansas River), ran through the Cimarron Desert and then along the Cimarron River. Lower Cimarron Spring on the riverbank was an important watering and camping spot. *In 1831 Comanche Indians killed Jedediah Smith (a famous hunter, trapper, and explorer) on the Santa Fe Trail near the Cimarron River. His body was never recovered. *In 1834 General Henry Leavenworth established Camp Arbuckle (Fort Arbuckle) at the mouth of the Cimarron River. Later known as Old Fort Arbuckle, it was active for only about a year, and its former site is now submerged beneath the Arkansas River. It should not be confused with the later Fort Arbuckle in Garvin County, Oklahoma. *Historic sites along the river include the ruins of Camp Nichols, a stone fort Kit Carson built in 1865 to protect travelers from raids by Plains Indians on the Cimarron Cutoff. It was near present-day Wheeless, Oklahoma. *The old Chisholm Trail crossed the river at Red Fork Station near present-day Dover, Oklahoma. *In the 1890s the Creek Nation Cave along the Cimarron River near Ingalls in the Oklahoma Territory, was a hideout for the Doolin gang, which included the teenage bandits Cattle Annie and Little Britches. *On September 18, 1906, a bridge across the Cimarron near Dover, Oklahoma Territory, collapsed beneath a Rock Island train bound for Fort Worth, Texas from Chicago. The bridge was a temporary structure unable to withstand the pressure of debris and high water. The railroad had delayed replacing it with a permanent structure for financial reasons. Several sources report that over 100 people were killed, but the figure is disputed. The true number may be as low as four.

The wood being fed into a moulder is commonly referred to as either stock or blanks. The spindle may be raised and lowered relative to the shaper's table, and rotates between 3,000 and 10,000 rpm, with stock running along a vertical fence. Wood shaper cutter heads typically have three blades, and turn at 1/2 to 1/8th the speed of smaller, much less expensive two-bladed bits used on a hand-held wood router.Shaper or a router - Which is best for your shop? Adapters are sold allowing a shaper to drive router bits, a compromise on several levels. As are router tables, cost-saving adaptations of hand-held routers mounted to comparatively light-duty dedicated work tables. Being both larger and much more powerful than routers, shapers can cut much larger profiles than routers - such as for crown moulding and raised-panel doors - and readily drive custom-made bits fabricated with unique profiles. Shapers feature between 3/4, 1.5 and 5 hp belt-driven motors, which run much more quietly and smoothly than typically 20,000 to 25,000 rpm direct-drive routers. Speed adjustments are typically made by relocating the belts on a stepped pulley system, much like that on a drill press. Unlike routers, shapers are also able to run in reverse, which is necessary in performing some cuts. The most common form of wood shaper has a vertical spindle; some have horizontal; others yet have spindles or tables that tilt. Some European models variously combine sliding tablesaws, jointers, planers, and mortisers. Shapers can be adapted to perform specialized cuts employing accessories such as sliding tables, tenon tables, tilting arbor, tenoning hoods, and interchangeable spindles. The standard US spindle shaft is 1¼\\", with 3/4\\" or 1/2\\" on small shapers and 30mm on European models. Most spindles are tall enough to accommodate more than one cutter head, allowing rapid tooling changes by raising or lowering desired heads into position. Additional spindles can be fitted with pre-spaced cutter heads when more are needed for a job than fit on one. A wood moulder differs from a shaper, which typically has one vertical cutting head and none horizontal. The term \\"tooling\\" refers to a moulder's cutters, knives, blades including planer blades, and cutterheads. Safety The primary safety feature on a wood shaper is a guard mounted above the cutter protecting hands and garments from being drawn into its blades. Jigs, fixtures such as hold-downs, and accessories that include featherboards, also help prevent injury and generally result in better cuts. The starter, or fulcrum, pin is a metal rod which threads into the table a few inches away from the cutter allowing stock to be fed into it in a freehand cut. In addition to aiding productivity and setting a consistent rate of milling, a power feeder keeps appendages and garments out of harm's way. They may be multi-speed, and employ rubber wheels to feed stock past the cutter head. Types Before machines, men worked as \\"moulders\\" shaping wood by hand. *Single head moulders: *Single head moulders have a top (horizontal) head only. *Single head moulders are more economical but they also feed through slower than multi head moulders and, as the name implies, a *single head moulder will only cut one surface at a time. Multi Head Moulder: Standing from in front of the infeed side of the machine where the stock is fed into the machine. A common cutter head configuration is; Bottom horizontal head, a right hand vertical side head, a Left hand vertical side head, and a top horizontal head. This is a common configuration (in order of layout), but there are countless other configurations available. For instance; a multi head moulder may have two bottom heads and two top heads in order to size the lumber with the first top and the first bottom head, and then finish cut the lumber with the remaining top and bottom head. Machines with two or more right heads more common in the furniture industry to give the ability to run shorter stock and more detailed, deeper cuts on the edge of the stock. Tooling Tooling refers to cutters, knives, blades, as well as planer blades, and cutter heads. Most blades are made from either a type of tool steel known as high speed steel (HSS), or from carbide. Cutter heads are normally made from either steel or aluminum. High Speed Steel, carbide, aluminium, and steel for the cutter heads all come in a wide variety of grades.

The lake serves as a reservoir contributing to the water supply of the country. It lies next to the Lakeside MRT station, which derived its name from this geographical feature. The lake is surrounded by parkland, which serves as a recreational ground for nearby residents in Jurong East and Jurong West New Towns. A landscaped sanctuary called Jurong Lake Park was built around the perimeter of the lake and work was completed in January 2006. Also, a 2.8 kilometre water promenade along Jurong Lake Park would allow residents to participate in watersports. The inner running track starting from Chinese garden bridge and back is 3.4 kilometers in length. As is the case for most other reservoirs in Singapore, swimming is currently illegal in the lake, although this may change in line with the Singapore government's liberalisation of the use of bodies of water in the republic. Fishing is now allowed in some designated spots around the lake where only artificial baits can be used for fishing. However, the water is noted to be green in colour during dry weather and a murky brown after a downpour, the likely result of runoff from its urban catchment area. Tourist attractions There are several tourist attractions located near or even within the Lake, including a Chinese Garden and a Japanese Garden, which are located on their respective islands within the lake, as well as the nearby Tang Dynasty Village, which has since closed down. The Science Centre, Singapore, a family-oriented attraction in Jurong East, is located in the area, together with Jurong Country Club, which includes an 18-hole par-72 golf course and driving range. Redevelopment plan On 4 April 2008, the National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan announced a plan to develop the Jurong into a commercial hub outside the Central Business District (CBD). The new Jurong Lake District will offer a potential development area of 360 hectares, roughly the size of Marina Bay. The Urban Redevelopment Authority said that some 750,000m2 of land will be set aside at Jurong Gateway, expected to attract billions of dollars in development, for offices, hotels, food and beverage and entertainment uses. However, analysts say that the short 10–15 years time frame may be a little tight, due to the number of projects in progress and a dampened global economic climate. The Urban Redevelopment Authority announces a masterplan on 4 April 2008 to transform the area around Jurong Lake to a unique lakeside destination for business and leisure in the next 10 to 15 years.Government announces plans for Jurong Lake District A new district will be created, named, Jurong Lake District which consists of three precincts, Jurong Gateway, Lakeside and Lakeside Gateway.

He founded the National Party of Honduras in 1918, and was President of Honduras twice; briefly in 1924 and from 1933 to 1949.  Becoming president  Carías became a general during the revolution of 1924. In the 1923 elections, Carías was a candidate for the National Party against the divided Liberals, but only won a plurality of the vote. The resulting deadlock was followed by disturbances, and elections the following year saw Miguel Paz Barahona of the National Party elected, although Carías was able to exercise a degree of influence during Barahona's presidency. In 1928, Carías was the National Party's candidate but lost to Vicente Mejía Colindres of the Liberal Party. He accepted the result, as the election had been comparatively free and fair, marking a then-rare peaceful transfer of power between the two major parties. He was the President of National Congress of Honduras from 1926 to 1929, and from 1930 to 1931.http://www.xplorhonduras.com/presidentes-del-congreso-nacional-1900-2014/ On 1 February 1933 he became President of Honduras again, this time for 16 years. Despite growing unrest and severe economic strains, the 1932 Honduran presidential elections were relatively peaceful and fair. The peaceful transition of power was surprising because the onset of the Great Depression had led to the overthrow of governments elsewhere throughout Latin America, in nations with much stronger democratic traditions than those of Honduras. Vicente Mejía, however, resisted pressure from his own party to manipulate the results to favor the Liberal party candidate, José Ángel Zúñiga Huete. As a result, the National Party candidate, Carías, won the election by a margin of some 20,000 votes. On 16 November 1932, Carías assumed office, beginning what was to be the longest period of continuous rule by an individual in Honduran history. Lacking, however, was any immediate indication that the Carías administration was destined to survive any longer than most of its predecessors. Shortly before Carías's inauguration, dissident Liberals, despite the opposition of Vicente Mejía, had risen in revolt. Carías had taken command of the government forces, obtained arms from El Salvador, and crushed the uprising in short order. Most of Carías's first term in office was devoted to efforts to avoid financial collapse, improve the military, engage in a limited program of road building, and lay the foundations for prolonging his own hold on power. 1930s The economic situation remained extremely bad throughout the 1930s. In addition to the dramatic drop in banana exports caused by the Great Depression, the fruit industry was further threatened by the outbreak in 1935 of epidemics of Panama disease and Sigatoka in the banana-producing areas. Within a year, most of the country's production was threatened. Large areas, including most of those around Trujillo, Honduras were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans were thrown out of work. By 1937 a means of controlling the disease had been found, but many of the affected areas remained out of production because a significant share of the market formerly held by Honduras had shifted to other nations. Carías had made efforts to improve the military even before he became president. Once in office, both his capacity and his motivation to continue and to expand such improvements increased. He gave special attention to the fledgling air force, founding the Military Aviation School in 1934 and arranging for a United States colonel to serve as its commandant. As months passed, Carías moved slowly but steadily to strengthen his hold on power. He gained the support of the banana companies through opposition to strikes and other labor disturbances. He strengthened his position with domestic and foreign financial circles through conservative economic policies. Even in the height of the depression, he continued to make regular payments on the Honduran debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the arrangement with the British bondholders and also satisfying other creditors. Two small loans were paid off completely in 1935. In 1935, political controls were instituted slowly under Carías. The Communist Party of Honduras (Partido Comunista de Honduras—PCH) was outlawed, but the Liberal Party continued to function, and even the leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were later offered free air transportation should they wish to return to Honduras from their exile abroad. At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Carías began to crack down on the opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the National Party, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Carías in office could give the nation continued peace and order. The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents. The method chosen by Carías to extend his term of office was to call a constituent assembly that would write a new constitution and select the individual to serve for the first presidential term under that document. Except for the president's desire to perpetuate himself in office, there seemed little reason to alter the nation's basic charter. Earlier constituent assemblies had written thirteen constitutions (only ten of which had entered into force), and the latest had been adopted in 1924. The handpicked Constituent Assembly of 1936 incorporated thirty of the articles of the 1924 document into the 1936 constitution. The major changes were the elimination of the prohibition on immediate reelection of a president and vice president and the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. Other changes included restoration of the death penalty, reductions in the powers of the legislature, and denial of citizenship and therefore the right to vote to women. Finally, the new constitution included an article specifying that the incumbent president and vice president would remain in office until 1943. But Carías, by then a virtual dictator, wanted even more, so in 1939 the legislature, now completely controlled by the National Party, obediently extended his term in office by another six years (to 1949). The Liberals and other opponents of the government reacted to these changes by attempting to overthrow Carías. Numerous efforts were made in 1936 and 1937, but all were successful only in further weakening the National Party's opponents. By the end of the 1930s, the National Party was the only organized functioning political party in the nation. Numerous opposition leaders had been imprisoned, and some had reportedly been chained and put to work in the streets of Tegucigalpa. Others, including the leader of the Liberal Party, Ángel Zúñiga, had fled into exile. During his presidency, Carías cultivated close relations with his fellow Central American dictators, generals Jorge Ubico in Guatemala, Maximiliano Hernández in El Salvador, and Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. Relations were particularly close with Ubico, who helped Carías reorganize his secret police and also captured and shot the leader of a Honduran uprising who had made the mistake of crossing into Guatemalan territory. Relations with Nicaragua were somewhat more strained as a result of the continuing border dispute, but Carías and Somoza managed to keep this dispute under control throughout the 1930s and 1940s. 1940s The value of the ties between the Carías government and nearby dictatorial regimes became somewhat questionable in 1944 when popular revolts in Guatemala and El Salvador deposed Ubico and Hernández. For a time, it seemed as if revolutionary contagion might spread to Honduras as well. A plot, involving some military officers as well as opposition civilians, had already been discovered and crushed in late 1943. In May 1944, a group of women began demonstrating outside of the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa, demanding the release of political prisoners. Despite strong government measures, tension continued to grow and Carías was ultimately forced to release some prisoners. This gesture failed to satisfy the opposition and anti-government demonstrations continued to spread. In July several demonstrators were killed by troops in San Pedro Sula. In October a group of exiles invaded Honduras from El Salvador but were unsuccessful in their efforts to topple the government. The military remained loyal and Carías continued in office. Eager to curb further disorders in the region, the United States began to urge Carías to step aside and allow free elections when his current term in office expired. Carías, who by then was in his early seventies, ultimately yielded to these pressures and announced October 1948 elections, in which he would refrain from being a candidate. He continued, however, to find ways to use his power. The National Party nominated Carías's choice for president, Juan Manuel Gálvez, who had been minister of war since 1933. Exiled opposition figures were allowed to return to Honduras, and the Liberals, trying to overcome years of inactivity and division, nominated Ángel Zúñiga, the same individual whom Carías had defeated in 1932. The Liberals rapidly became convinced that they had no chance to win and, charging the government with manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This act gave Gálvez a virtually unopposed victory, and in January 1949 he assumed the presidency. In 1954, the incumbent President Gálvez had intended to step aside and allow a free and fair contest. Carías intended to return to the presidency, but his candidacy caused a split in the ruling National Party. The Liberal candidate Ramón Villeda Morales won a plurality, but short of a majority (a result echoing the elections of 1902 and 1923), resulting in a deadlock. Vice President Julio Lozano Díaz seized power in a coup, abruptly ending three decades of stable government in Honduras, of which Carías had been president for 16 of those years. Legacy Evaluating the Carías presidency is a difficult task. His tenure in office provided the nation with a badly needed period of relative peace and order. The country's fiscal situation improved steadily, education improved slightly, the road network expanded, and the armed forces were modernized. At the same time, nascent democratic institutions withered, opposition and labor activities were suppressed and national interests at times were sacrificed to benefit supporters and relatives of Carías or major foreign interests.

The other Hualapai regional bands (including the Havasupai) lived far away from the current reservation land. =Hualapai War= The Hualapai War (1865–1870) was caused by an increase in traffic through the area on the Fort Mojave-Prescott Toll Road which elevated tensions and produced armed conflicts between the Hualapai and European Americans. The war broke out in May 1865, when the Hualapai leader Anasa was killed by a man named Hundertinark in the area of Camp Willow Grove and in March 1866. In response, a man named Clower was killed by the Hualapai, who also closed the route from Prescott, Arizona to the Colorado River ports due to the conflict. The most important and principal Hualapai leaders (called Tokoomhet or Tokumhet) at that time were: Wauba Yuba (Wauba Yuma of the Yavapai Fighters subtribe), Sherum (Shrum or Cherum of the Ha Emete Pa'a i.e. \\"Cerbat Mountain band\\" of the Middle Mountain People subtribe), Hitchi Hitchi (Hitchie-Hitchie of the Plateau People subtribe)Walapai - Sociopolitical Organization and Susquatama (Sudjikwo'dime, better known by his nickname Hualapai Charley, Hualapai Charlie, Walapai Charley or Walapai Charlie of the Middle Mountain People subtribe). It was not until William Hardy and the Hualapai leaders negotiated a peace agreement at Beale Springs that the raids and the fighting subsided. However, the agreement lasted only nine months when it was broken with the murder of Chief Wauba Yuba near present-day Kingman during a dispute with the Walker Party over the treaty. After the chief's murder, raids by the Hualapai began in full force on mining camps and settlers. The cavalry from Fort Mojave responded, with the assistance of the Mohave, by attacking Hualapai rancherias and razing them. The pivotal engagement took place in January 1868, when Captain S.B.M. Young, later joined in by Lt. Johnathan D. Stevenson, surprised the rancheria of Sherum with his more than one hundred warriors. Known as the Battle of Cherum Peak, it lasted all day. Stevenson fell in the first volley. The Hualapai managed to escape, but lost twenty-one warriors, with many more wounded. The Battle broke the military resistance of the Hualapai. The Hualapai began to surrender, as whooping cough and dysentery weakened their ranks, on August 20, 1868. They were led by Chief Leve Leve (Levi-Levi, half-brother to Sherum and Hualapai Charley)often Leve Leve is mistaken for a Yavapai leader - but he is actually only a band leader of the Yavapai Fighters subtribe, which were named for their fighting against the enemy Yavapai of the Amat Whala Pa'a (Mad hwa:la Ba:' - \\"Hualapai Mountains band\\") of the Yavapai Fighters subtribe. The warrior Sherum, who was known for his tenacity as a warrior, later surrendered, thus marking the end of the Hualapai Wars in 1870. It is estimated that one-third of the Hualapai people were killed during this war either by the conflict or disease.

Ethnically, the Havasupai and the Hualapai are one people, although today, they are politically separate groups as the result of U.S. government policy. The Hualapai (Pa'a or Pai) had three subtribes - the Middle Mountain People in the northwest, Plateau People in the east, and Yavapai Fighter in the south (McGuire; 1983). The subtribes were divided into seven bands (Kroeber; 1935, Manners; 1974), which themselves were broken up into thirteen (original fourteen)of the original 14 Hualapai bands or local groups the Red Rock band had completely mixed with the other bands before European American contact and were therefore not recognized as a distinct bandNina Swidler, Roger Anyon: Native Americans and Archaeologists: Stepping Stones to Common Ground, page 142, Alta Mira Press; 8.

Located in the Garhwal region of the state of Uttarakhand (formerly the northwestern section of Uttar Pradesh), the circuit consists of four sites—Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath.Chard Dham Yatra - Govt. of Uttarakhand, Official website. Badrinath is also one of the four destinations (with each destination being in different corners of the country) of the longer Char Dham from which the Chota Char Dham likely draws its name.Char Dham yatra kicks off as portals open - Hindustan TimesDestination Profiles of the Holy Char Dhams, Uttarakhand The Annual Char Dham Yatra resumed in May 2014, after remaining suspended since the outbreak of 2013 Uttarakhand floods. The footfall has now improved due to proactive measures taken by the government of Uttarakhand. Akha-Trij or Akha-Teej (Julian and Gregorian Calendars, May) marks the beginning of the Char Dham Yatra. The ‘Yatra’ typically closes 2 days after Diwali, on the day of Bhai- Bij (or Bhai Dooj). Also, there are chances of roadblocks due to heavy rainfall in late July and August. In May and June, tourists flock in large numbers. So, there is very little time offered for ‘Darshan’. So, it is best to take the Char Dham Yatra in mid May to July and September - October.  Origins and the original Char Dham  Yamunotri temple and ashrams Originally, the appellation Char Dham referred to a pilgrimage circuit encompassing four important temples—Puri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, and Badrinath—located roughly at the four cardinal points of the subcontinent. An archetypal All-India pilgrimage circuit, the formation of the original Char Dham is credited to the great 8th century reformer and philosopher Shankaracharya (Adi Sankara). In the original Char Dham, three of the four sites are Vaishnava (Puri, Dwarka and Badrinath) while one is Shaiva (Rameswaram). The Chota Char Dham included representatives from all three major Hindu sectarian traditions, with two Shakti (goddess) sites, (Yamunotri and Gangotri), one Shaiva site (Kedarnath), and one Vaishnava site (Badrinath). Accessible until the 1950s only by arduous and lengthy walking trails in hilly area with height repeatedly exceeded 4000 meters, the Chota Char Dham was regularly done by wandering ascetics and other religious people, and those who could afford a traveling entourage. While the individual sites and the circuit as a whole were well known to Hindus on the plains below, they were not a particularly visible aspect of yearly religious culture. After the 1962 war between India and China, accessibility to the Chota Char Dham improved, as India undertook massive road building to border area and other infrastructure investments. As pilgrims were able to travel in mini buses, jeeps and cars to nearest points of four shrines, the Chota Char dham circuit was within the reach of people with middle income. Vehicles reach up to Badrinath temple and Gangotri, Yamunotri and Kedarnath are at a distance of 10 to 15 km from nearest motorable road.  Recent development  The Chota Char Dham has become an important destination for pilgrims from throughout South Asia and the diaspora, particularly Biharis, Telugu's of Telangana and AndhraPradesh, Bengalis, Marwaris, Odias, Marathis, Gujaratis, Delhites and people from Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Today, the circuit receives hundreds of thousands of visitors in an average pilgrimage season, which lasts from approximately April 15 until Diwali (sometime in November). The season is heaviest in the two-month period before the monsoon, which normally comes in late July. After the rains begin, travel to the sites becomes extremely dangerous. Even before the rains begin, safety is a major concern, as extensive road building and heavy traffic have critically destabilized the rocks, making fatal landslides and bus/jeep accidents a regular occurrence. Mortality rates for a season often surpass 200. Some pilgrims also visit the sites after the rains ends and before the sites become impassable due to snow. Although temperatures at the shrines in the early winter months of October and November are inhospitable, it is said that the mountain scenery surrounding the sites is most vivid after the rains have had a chance to moisten the dust of the plains below. The Chota Char Dham was washed away in the recent 2013 Himalayan flash floods. One of the worst flash floods happened in June 2013 and it heavily devastated many parts of the Chota Char Dham, particularly the town of Kedarnath was almost destroyed and with only the Kedarnathji Temple and a few buildings around remaining intact, albeit partially submerged by rocks and slurry.Chār Dhām Yātra: Ecstatic Flight Into Himalayas, by G.

Historical Background The U.S. Army Field Artillery branch traces its origins to 17 November 1775 when the Continental Congress, unanimously elected Henry Knox \\"Colonel of the Regiment of Artillery\\". The regiment formally entered service on 1 January 1776. During the 19th Century a total of seven Artillery regiments were formed which contained a mixture of \\"heavy\\" artillery companies and \\"light\\" artillery batteries. The light artillery batteries took the role of field artillery although they did not use that designation. The seven artillery regiments were designated as regiments of artillery and were not distinguished as being either \\"coast\\" or \\"field\\" artillery as was the practice in the 20th Century. In the reorganization of the Army by the Act of 2 February 1901, the seven Artillery regiments were reorganized as the Artillery Corps. The Corps was split into 195 battery-sized units, called companies at the time, of Field Artillery and Coast Artillery. In 1907 the Artillery Corps was reorganized into the Field Artillery and the Coast Artillery Corps.Smith, Bolling W.; Gaines, William C., Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group website Although presently Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery are separate branches, both inherit the traditions of the Artillery branch. In 1907, the Field Artillery companies of the Artillery Corps were organized into six Field Artillery regiments. In 1916, as the United States was preparing for its eventual entry into World War I, these six regiments were supplemented by 15 more Field Artillery regiments. During World War I numerous other Field Artillery Regiments were organized in the National Guard and National Army, which were mobilized to supplement the Regular Army. =Lineage= In 1924 the Army organized the Coast Artillery Corps into regiments. The first seven regiments retained the lineage of the seven Artillery regiments which existed in the 19th Century. The Coast Artillery Corps was disbanded in 1950 and its units were consolidated with the Field Artillery in the Artillery branch. In 1968 the Artillery branch divided into Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery branches with the newly formed 1st through 7th Air Defense Artillery regiments retaining the lineage of the seven 19th Century artillery regiments. Although the oldest Artillery regiments in the Army are in the Air Defense Artillery branch, this is not necessarily the case for individual units below the regimental level. For example, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Field Artillery traces its lineage to the Alexander Hamilton Battery, formed in 1776, which is the oldest Artillery unit in the active United States Army and is the only Regular Army unit which can trace its lineage to the American Revolution. The oldest Field Artillery unit in the U.S. Army is 1st Battalion, 101st Field Artillery, Massachusetts Army National Guard, which traces its origins to December 1636. Originally an Infantry unit, it was reorganized as an Artillery unit in 1916.Oldest Field Artillery Battalion Takes Charge at Camp Phoenix – DVIDS News  Mission statement  The mission of the Field Artillery is to destroy, defeat, or disrupt the enemy with integrated fires to enable maneuver commanders to dominate in unified land operations.  History  The Field Artillery is one of the Army's combat arms, traditionally one of the three major branches (with Infantry and Armor). It refers to those units that use artillery weapons systems to deliver surface-to-surface long range indirect fire. Indirect fire means that the projectile does not follow the line of sight to the target. Mortars are not field artillery weapons; they are organic to infantry units and are manned by infantry personnel (US Army MOS 11C or USMC 0341). The term field artillery is to distinguish from the Air Defense Artillery, and historically, from the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps (with the function of coastal defense artillery), a branch which existed from 1901–1950. In 1950, the two branches were unified and called simply Artillery, until Air Defense Artillery was made into a separate branch in 1968. The insignia of the Field Artillery branch is a pair of crossed field guns (19th- century-style cannon) in gold, and dates back to 1834. The home of the Field Artillery and the Field Artillery School are at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Captain Harry S Truman in 1918—the only \\"redleg\\" to become President Field artillery is called the \\"King of Battle\\". Conflicts in the 20th century saw artillery become exponentially more effective as indirect fire methods were introduced immediately prior to World War I. During World War I and World War II, field artillery was the single highest casualty-producing weapons system on any battlefield. Soldiers from artillery units have often been used as infantry during both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. While field artillery units have often performed admirably as infantry and accomplishing infantry missions, such use has led to atrophy of essential field artillery specific skills and tasks.Sean MacFarland, Michael Shields, and Jeffrey Snow, \\"White Paper: The King and I: The impending Crisis in Field Artillery’s ability to provide Fire Support to Maneuver Commander (np:np): memo sent to the Chief of Staff of the Army, 2007. 1. =Branch colors= Members of the Field Artillery are referred to as \\"redlegs\\" because during the Mexican American War, both Ringgold's Battery and Duncan's Battery were issued uniforms distinguished by scarlet stripes down the legs of their uniform pants, a practice continued through the Civil War and on dress uniforms even after WWI. Scarlet was established as the Artillery Branch color along with crossed cannon branch insignia in the Regulations of 1833. Branch colors are found on the shoulder straps of officers wearing the blue dress uniform and on branch of service scarves authorized for wear with a variety of uniforms.Army Regulation 670–1Center of Military History Survey of US Army Uniforms, Weapons and Accoutrements =Chief of Field Artillery= From 1920 to 1942, the Field Artillery corps was led by a branch chief who held the rank of major general. This was in keeping with the Army's other major branches, including infantry, cavalry, and coast artillery. Each chief was responsible for planning and overseeing execution of training, equipping, and manning within his branch. From 1903 to 1908, one Chief of Artillery oversaw both field artillery and coast artillery. After 1908, one general served as Chief of Coast Artillery. After 1920, the Chief of Coast Artillery was joined by the Chief of Field Artillery. The branch chief positions were eliminated in 1942, and their functions consolidated under the commander of the Army Ground Forces as a way to end inter-branch rivalries and enable synchronized and coordinated activities as part of World War II's combined arms doctrine. The Chiefs of Artillery included: #Brigadier General Wallace F. Randolph, 1903-1904 #Brigadier General John Patten Story, 1904-1905 #Brigadier General Samuel M. Mills, 1905–1906 #Brigadier General Arthur Murray, 1906–1908 (became the first Chief of Coast Artillery) The Chiefs of Field Artillery were: #Major General William J. Snow, 1920–1927 #Major General Fred T. Austin, 1927–1930 #Major General Harry G. Bishop, 1930–1934 #Major General Upton Birnie Jr., 1934–1938 #Major General Robert M. Danford, 1938–1942 Publications The professional journal of the Field Artillery is published at Fort Sill. Known as the Field Artillery Journal in 1911, it went through many name changes through Field Artillery in 1987. The journal merged with Air Defense Artillery in 2007 to become Fires. Current weapon systems The U.S. Army employs five types of field artillery weapon systems: * M119A3 105mm light towed howitzer * M777A2 155mm medium towed howitzer * M109A7 Paladin 155mm self-propelled howitzer * M142 High Mobility Rocket Artillery System (HIMARS), a wheeled launcher capable of firing 227mm rockets or Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles * M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), a self-propelled launcher capable of firing 227mm rockets or Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles. = LRPF = Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is a priority of the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC).

In 1794 a \\"Corps of Artillerists and Engineers\\" was organized, which included the four companies of artillery then in service and had sixteen companies in four battalions. In 1802 there was a reduction of the army. The Artillery were separated from the Engineers and the former formed into one regiment of 20 companies. In 1808 a regiment of ten companies called the \\"Regiment of Light Artillery\\" was formed. In 1812 two more regiments were added.

Under this system the 1st through 21st and 76th through 83d were organized in the Regular Army; the 101st through 151st, in the National Guard; and, the 25th through 75th, 84th and 85th, and the 301st through 351st in the National Army. Field Artillery Brigades, numbered 1st through 24th, 51st through 67th, and 151st through 172d, were also organized, with each brigade typically commanding three regiments; each division had one of these artillery brigades.Rinaldi, pp. 124–150 A 1918 expansion added the 22d Field Artillery Regiment through the 39th Field Artillery Regiment with some exceptions, notably Philippine Scouts units. The Coast Artillery Corps constantly reorganized the numbered companies until 1924, but during World War I created 61 artillery regiments from the numbered companies, for service (or potential service) with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF); the 30th through 45th Artillery Brigades were also created to command groups of these regiments.Rinaldi, pp. 157–165 These regiments operated almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery on the Western Front, and were designated, for example, 51st Artillery (Coast Artillery Corps (CAC)). Most of these were disbanded immediately after the war. The Coast Artillery also acquired the antiaircraft mission during the war, which was formalized a few years later. In 1924 the Coast Artillery Corps adopted a regimental system, and numbered companies were returned to letter designations. (In order to promote esprit-de-corps, the first 7 regiments were linked to the original 7 regiments of artillery). During 1943 most antiaircraft units lost their Coast Artillery designations, and the regiments were broken up into battalions. However, the antiaircraft branch remained nominally part of the Coast Artillery Corps. In late 1944 the Coast Artillery harbor defense regiments were inactivated or reorganized as battalions, which themselves were mostly disbanded in April 1945, with personnel transferred to the local Harbor Defense Commands. 977 Coast Artillery and antiaircraft battalions were created before the branch's demise in 1950.Berhow, pp. 423–500Stanton, pp. 434–510 In 1943 an Army-wide (except infantry) reorganization created numerous serially numbered battalions, and most regiments were broken up into battalions. Also during World War II new designations were applied to some units, the \\"Armored Field Artillery Battalion\\" for self-propelled units and the \\"Parachute (or Glider) Field Artillery Battalion\\" for airborne units. A number of \\"Field Artillery Groups\\" were also created during the war.Stanton, pp. 339–424 The Army Anti-Aircraft Command ARAACOM was created July 1950, and in 1957, ARAACOM was renamed to US Army Air Defense Command (USARADCOM). A new system, the U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System, or CARS, was adopted in 1957 to replace the old regimental system. CARS used the Army's traditional regiments as parent organizations for historical purposes, but the primary building blocks are divisions, and brigades became battalions. Each battalion carries an association with a parent regiment, even though the regimental organization no longer exists. In some brigades several numbered battalions carrying the same regimental association may still serve together, and tend to consider themselves part of the traditional regiment when in fact they are independent battalions serving a brigade, rather than a regimental, headquarters. From circa 1959 through 1971 antiaircraft units and field artillery units were combined with common parent regiments for lineage purposes, for example the \\"1st Artillery\\". In 1968 the Air Defense Artillery Branch (United States Army) was split from the artillery, with the Regular Army air defense and field artillery regiments separating on 1 September 1971. The CARS was replaced by the U.S. Army Regimental System (USARS) in 1981. US Artillery Structure 1989. On 1 October 2005, the word \\"regiment\\" was formally appended to the name of all active and inactive CARS and USARS regiments. So, for example, the 1st Cavalry officially became titled the 1st Cavalry Regiment. During the Cold War the Field Artillery was responsible for all mobile ballistic missile weapons systems, including the Lance and Pershing II ballistic missiles.

Their first release was on their own Fork in Hand Records label, but have since teamed with Springman Records and SideOneDummy. The band has been noted for its strict DIY work ethic, such as engineering, producing, and releasing their own albums and videos and self-promotion of their own shows. The band released Good Luck in 1999 on Asian Man Records and quickly gained a large underground audience. The album featured a 10 piece band, including six horn players. The album is characterized and widely liked due to its catchy horn melodies, along with its fun and energetic nature. In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand. They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel. In 2002, they released The Gipsy Hill LP, a collection of some of their thrash material, as well as their covers of \\"Wailing Paddle\\" by the Rudiments and \\"New England\\" by Jonathan Richman. This album featured what is considered to be the \\"classic\\" Big D lineup, which featured long-time members such as Sean P. Rogan, David McWane, Steve Foote, Chris Bush, Paul Cuttler and Dan Stoppelman. This lineup was also featured on How it Goes, which was released in 2004, as well as Strictly Rude in 2007 and Fluent in Stroll in 2009. In 2005, long-time saxophonist Chris Bush left the band to move to Denver, Colorado (and eventually to Hawaii) and was replaced by Ryan O'Connor, who has remained in the band since. O'Connor's first appearance on a Big D record was for their 2007 release Strictly Rude. Big D and the Kids Table played 200 shows a year around this time on average, in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour. The band has also performed in the Summer of Ska Tour 2012 and the Ska Is Dead tour. In the fall and winter of 2007 the band embarked on their first- ever large scale headlining tour, The Steady Riot Tour, named after the 2007 release. Name origin Different stories exist about the band name's origin, especially about running over pets named Big D. However, lead singer Dave McWane has said that the band actually got their name when a friend, Conor Donnelly, told him that if he ever started a band he should call it Big D and the Kids Table, so he did. Band historyEarly years (1995–1998)= Big D and the Kids Table was founded in 1995, when members converged at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Despite a frequently revolving lineup, the band built up a large local following almost immediately, packing clubs, halls, dorms, and basements in and around Boston. The band formed their own label, Fork in Hand Records, to put out their first album, Shot By Lammi, a split with Boston punk band Drexel, a side project of several Big D members (under assumed names). Soon, their label was releasing albums by a stable of Boston-area bands, building a vibrant punk/ska scene around them. Following Shot By Lammi, the band released a Live EP, recorded in the Bentley University cafeteria. Early on, they also began their tradition of holding an annual Halloween concert at home in Boston. =Good Luck, How it Goes, Strictly Rude (1999–2009)= In 1999, Big D signed on to Mike Park's Asian Man Records and released their first full-length album, Good Luck. Big D picked up the award for Outstanding Ska Band at the 1999 Boston Music Awards. The band returned in 2002 with The Gipsy Hill EP and continued with their busy show schedule (playing an average of 200 shows a year), as a split EP with Japanese noise rock act Melt Banana appeared in 2003. Also in 2003, the band released a gangsta rap album of their songs recorded in 2000 on their own Fork in Hand Records. Fueled by a DIY work ethic since early on, the band's small fan base kept growing through touring and promotion, all with little label support and money. Big D performed on several dates of that summer's Warped Tour and also played at Vegas' Ska Summit. In 2004, the band signed to Springman Records and released How It Goes. They headed out across North America in 2004 on the Ska Is Dead tour with Catch 22, Mustard Plug, and the Planet Smashers. Following the release of How It Goes, Big D released several music video variations of their cover of The Specials' \\"Little Bitch,\\" taking place in Montreal, St. Pete, and on Warped Tour. While continuing to tour with bands such as Suicide Machines, Reel Big Fish, and Streetlight Manifesto, the band released a limited edition EP titled Salem Girls for Halloween 2005. This was the first recording featuring new drummer Jon Reilly. Also in 2005, \\"You Lost, You're Crazy\\" from How It Goes appeared on the 'Warped Tour 2005 Tour Compilation as Big D toured with Warped Tour again. In March 2007, Big D released Strictly Rude and proceeded to tour with Anti-Flag, Alexisonfire and Set Your Goals in the Spring of 2007. That summer they were on the Vans Warped Tour and followed it with a fall US headlining tour. In the summer of 2008 they were a part of the Shout It Loud tour along with Less Than Jake, Goldfinger, Suburban Legends and Westbound Train. In early 2009, they took part in a short east coast tour with The English Beat. =Fluent in Stroll, and for the Damned, The Dumb and the Delirious (2010–2012)= Fluent in Stroll was released by the band on July 7, 2009. They spent the summer promoting the album playing the entire 2009 Warped Tour. Shortly after this release, trombonist Paul Cuttler ceased touring with the band to spend more time with his family at home. He still appears live occasionally at local Big D shows, as well on their past few records. Following the conclusion of the Warped Tour, they embarked on their 2nd headlining tour, which took place throughout the fall of 2009, called the \\"Not Fucking Around tour.\\" It was named after the track on the new album (in the same way \\"the Steady Riot tour\\" supported Strictly Rude). illScarlett served as direct support for the majority of the tour. Sean P. Rogan departed the band in 2009. After Rogan's departure Suburban Legends' Brian Klemm filled in as touring guitarist through 2010. Then in 2011, Nick Pantazi from the seminal Boston ska band Big Lick joined Big D on Guitar, until leaving in 2013 and was replaced by Alex Stern of Boston band The Pomps. Chris Lucca of Suburban Legends joined the band on trumpet around this time, but also left the band in 2013. His role was temporarily filled by Billy Kottage, who joined Reel Big Fish shortly after his tenure with Big D. Billy Kottage was later replaced by Logan La Barbera, who has remained with the band since. On June 25, 2010 Big D played the Carson, California stop on Warped Tour. This was the only stop on the tour the band would go on to play that year. In an interview done on the same day for thepunksite.com, McWane stated that the band is set to release their next studio album entitled, \\"The Damned, The Dumb and the Delirious\\" in 2011. On January 5, 2011 the band announced on their Facebook page they would be playing the entire 2011 Vans Warped Tour. In late November 2011, the band announced they were cancelling the remainder of their European tour in support of for the Damned, following lead singer Dave McWane's diagnosis with thyroid cancer. After surgery and radiation, McWane was declared cancer free, and the band went back on tour in April 2012. =Stomp and Stroll (2013–present)= In early February 2013, it was announced that the bands' next release would be two separate records, one ska/punk album, and another reggae/stroll/dub record. Stomp and Stroll released on June 11, 2013. This album featured new guitarist Alex Stern, bassist Steve Foote, drummer Derek Davis, long-time saxophonist Ryan O'Connor, former trumpeter Dan Stoppelman, former trombonist Paul Cuttler, former vocalist and trombonist Marc Flynn, among others. Shortly after this release, Steve Foote was replaced by bassist Ben Basile, leaving vocalist David McWane as the only consistently appearing \\"original\\" Big D member. Big D and the Kids Table performing in The Masquerade, Atlanta - 2013.10.29 In 2014, the band performed \\"Good Luck\\" in its entirety, which featured several of the original members of the band returning to the stage for the first time in over a decade, including Marc Flynn. In 2014 and once again in 2015, Chris Bush appeared live with the band for the first time since his departure in 2005. In September 2015, it was reported that the band would be providing theme music for an American-produced animated special featuring Domo, the mascot of Japanese public broadcaster NHK, entitled Domo Rock!, starring veteran actor George Takei. The band continues to tour semi- frequently. Trombonist Logan La Barbera, formerly of The Flaming Tsunamis and Royal City Riot joined the band in 2013 after Billy Kottage played with Big D on trombone periodically throughout 2013 before joining Reel Big Fish. Saxophonist Jonathan Degen, formerly of Royal City Riot, joined Big D in 2015 as well while O'Connor was absent from tours and shows and Degen has played with the band ever since. Their live shows near Boston sometimes feature former touring and recording members such as trumpet player Dan Stoppelman, bassist Steve Foote, guitarist Sean P. Rogan, and most frequently, trombonist Paul Cuttler, among others. In 2017, drummer Derek Davis left the band to do guitar/drum tech for bands like Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and The Dropkick Murphys. Derek Davis was replaced by Alex Brander. Some of their live performances and occasionally their tours feature the \\"Doped Up Dollies\\" singers. As of mid 2019, the band has stated that they have begun recording a new full-length album.

If there were any records of the incident at his birthplace, planet Vesper, they could have mentioned his biological father's surname, 'Vaughn'. He received his given name, 'Stakar', from his adoptive father, Ogord. Arcturian computer records depicted in Marvel Presents referred to him as 'Stakar of the House of Ogord' rather than 'Stakar Ogord'. He was evidently still legally considered to be part of Ogord's 'House', despite turning against it. is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by Steve Gerber (writer) and Sal Buscema (artist). He is an antihero in the Earth-691 timeline of the Marvel Comics universe. Stakar was fated to eventually re-inhabit his infant body, reliving his life over countless times. Because of the knowledge of things to come, he manipulated events to affect what he felt would be the best outcome, referring to himself as \\"One Who Knows\\". He made many enemies in doing so, but his tampering and guidance also led to the formation of the Guardians of the Galaxy in the 31st Century.Guardians of the Galaxy v1 #26 Sylvester Stallone played Stakar in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Publication history A character called Starhawk appeared in an advertisement on the last page of Marvel Super-Heroes #20 (May, 1969) as the feature that would appear in the next issue. That next issue, though, and all subsequent issues of the title, were reprints of older Marvel material. Writer Roy Thomas explained that publisher Martin Goodman \\"had no faith in science- fiction comics,\\" especially three particular elements that were all included on artist Dan Adkins' cover. \\"Rockets, robots and ray-guns. By sheer accident, we hadn't missed a trick in including all three of the elements which Martin Goodman considered deadly. So he cancelled the book. Period. End of story.\\" The unused cover of the Starhawk feature from Marvel Super-Heroes was used as the cover of the third issue of Marvelmania, Marvel's in-house fanzine, and the first part of the unused story itself was printed in Marvelmania #6. Though the serialization was to continue in the next issue, the title was cancelled before that happened. The in-continuity Starhawk first appeared in a cameo appearance in The Defenders #27 (Sep 1975), with his first full appearance in The Defenders #28 (Oct 1975). The character was created by Steve Gerber and Sal Buscema. It is unclear whether this Starhawk has any connection to the Marvel Super-Heroes character. Starhawk appeared along with the rest of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the 2014 series Guardians 3000. Writer Dan Abnett described him as \\"the soul\\" of the team. Fictional character biographyOrigin= A male child was born to the superheroes Quasar and Kismet in about the year 2002 of the Earth-691 timeline.Kismet discovered she was pregnant during War of the Worlds, which commenced in June 2001, according to Marvel Graphic Novel #7. As such, he was half human and half-artificially created being. Just as soon as he was born on the planet Vesper, he was kidnapped and deposited on the planet Arcturus IV. The baby was discovered by an Arcturian couple who were among the last of their planet's mutants; for much of his life, Stakar would believe that these mutants were his birth parents. The mutants were found and slain by the Reavers of Arcturus, Arcturian military cadres dedicated to eradicating the mutants of their race. The Reaver Ogord discovered the infant and, assuming him to be a normal Arcturian, adopted the child and raised him as his own with his wife Salaan, naming the boy Stakar.Marvel Presents #9. Marvel Comics. Stakar cultivated an interest in science and archaeology and explored ruins containing the Hawk God. Around the year 2020,Stakar was approaching the Arcturian age of manhood, which would have been at least 18 years after 2002. he and his adoptive sister Aleta Ogord reanimated the dormant deity and were physically transformed. They took turns occupying the same physical space, while the other stayed in a type of \\"limbo\\". They were given extraordinary power and left Arcturus IV for the stars; when dominant, Stakar adopted the costumed identity of Starhawk. Developing romantic feelings for one another, Stakar and Aleta petitioned the Hawk God to temporarily separate them. During this time, they had three children together: Sita, John and Tara.Marvel Presents #9–10. Marvel Comics. Upon receiving his power from the Hawk God, Starhawk identified himself and summarized his purpose by saying \\"I am the wisdom and the glory of your ancestors. I am the light and the giver of light. I am your heritage and your destiny! I am the POWER that was Arcturus!\\"Marvel Presents #10. Marvel Comics. =Guardians of the Galaxy= As an adventurer and protector, Starhawk revealed himself to the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Defenders in the year 3014. He aided them in overthrowing the Badoon occupation of Earth.Defenders #27 Starhawk joined the Guardians of the Galaxy in a space mission, and helped defeat the Topographical Man.Marvel Presents #3–7 It is later revealed he manipulated events to bring the Guardians together; for example, when Charlie-27 teleported from Jupiter to escape the Badoon, Starhawk caused him to be transported to Pluto where he met Martinex.Guardians of the Galaxy #26, cover-dated July 1992. Marvel Comics. During this time, Stakar's three children (Tara, John and Sita) were changed into energy vampires by Aleta's father and sent to kill Stakar. They died of accelerated old age. Aleta thereafter blamed Stakar (rather than her father) for the deaths of their children, and their relationship never recovered.Marvel Presents #9-11. Marvel Comics. Starhawk teamed with the time- traveling Thor, and battled Korvac and his Minions of Menace.Thor Annual #6 Starhawk later traveled to the 1970s alongside his fellow Guardians, and assisted the Avengers in battle against Korvac.Avengers #167–168, 170, 173, 175–177 Alongside the Guardians, the Fantastic Four, Dargo, and Keeper, Starhawk battled manifestations of Korvac's power in various eras.Fantastic Four Annual #24; Thor Annual #16; Silver Surfer Annual #4; Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #1. Marvel Comics. In 3017, Starhawk accompanied the Guardians on a quest to find the lost shield of Captain America. He battled Taserface and the Stark, and was physically separated from Aleta in an accident.Guardians of the Galaxy #1–4. Marvel Comics. Aleta was the stronger of the pair, and Stakar forcibly reabsorbed her to sustain himself. The two struggled for dominance of their physical space, and Stakar metamorphosed into a 'dark' version of himself, projecting 'black light'. Because of Stakar's assault on their teammate, the Guardians chose to expel him from the team. Eventually, Aleta became dominant, and reverted Stakar's body to an infant state. Aware of his destiny, she sent him back in time to begin his life cycle again.Guardians of the Galaxy #32–33. Marvel Comics. =Freed from rebirth= When the Guardians traveled back in time to the 20th century of Earth-616, their native timeline was altered – to the extent that Starhawk had lived his entire life over again and was waiting for their arrival. Stakar and Aleta had harsh words for each other, and the Hawk God appeared and intervened, attaching the two ex-lovers by bonding their fingers together.Guardians of the Galaxy #45. Marvel Comics. After being forced to work together for a time, the Hawk God again granted them audience, allowing them to plead their cases. He separated them and allowed only Stakar to retain his power, while Aleta was given back her former power to manipulate light.Guardians of the Galaxy #50. Marvel Comics. Aleta then chose to stay with the Guardians, while the Hawk God told Stakar the truth about his ancestry.Guardians of the Galaxy #51. Marvel Comics. He then went on a quest to learn more. During this quest he found the wounded Silver Surfer, whom he healed and equipped his Quantum Bands for a short time. Eon then reveals to Stakar that his biological father Quasar once wore the bands. Starhawk is then consumed by Abrogate, a place where all former Quantum-Band wielders go after death. Quasar tells him about his lover and Stakar's mother Kismet. Stakar finds her alive and living in a secluded religious retreat on the planet Vesper.Guardians of the Galaxy #62. Marvel Comics. After that, a creature who called himself Era, the son of Eon, revealed himself. It admitted having kidnapped Stakar at birth, along with other vile deeds. With the encouragement of the Hawk God, Starhawk and Kismet dedicated themselves to locating and confronting Era. Starhawk as a female. From Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #5 (November 2008), art by Paul Pelletier. =Return= Using some technology from his timeline, Starhawk teleports himself into the 21st century of the Earth-616 timeline, to meet up with that era's equivalent of the Guardians of the Galaxy on Knowhere. Vance Astro, aka Major Victory, was found by this new squad of Guardians, and Starhawk fights him before teleporting away.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #3 (Sept. 2008). Marvel Comics. Starhawk again ventures to Knowhere, but this time appears as a woman. Claiming that there is not meant to be a Guardians of the Galaxy at this point in the timeline, and that Major Victory's appearance there has put the entire future in flux, she again attempts to kill Astro and the Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #5 (Nov. 2008).

She discovers that the anomaly that is disturbing the time stream is not Astro or the Guardians, but instead Black Bolt activating a bomb that will cause time and space to collapse. Starhawk sacrifices her life to save the Guardians, and instructs Star-Lord to stop Black Bolt, at any cost.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #16 (Sept. 2009). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The true extent of Starhawk's powers is unknown, but they are said to be immense in nature. He has an incredibly long lifespan, possibly inherited from his mother or due to his empowerment by the Hawk God. Starhawk can manipulate light to create concussive force blasts of photonic energy, heat, and solid-light constructs. He can also fly at the speed of light by tapping anti-gravitons, and survive in the vacuum of space. By tapping into Aleta's powers (when merged with her), he can also generate solid constructs of light; it is unknown if he can do so since their separation. His natural senses, especially eyesight, are enhanced to a superhuman degree; in addition, his powers give him extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations in his environment, and he can track energy trails across intergalactic distances. He has superhuman strength and durability, and he can enhance these further by reinforcing his body with light energy; on one occasion, he was able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the thunder god Thor. He has an immunity to most known diseases and radiation sickness. He seemingly has precognition, designating himself as \\"One-Who-Knows\\", but this is actually an effect of remembering what happened in his previous life cycle. However, due to Starhawk's efforts to change events for the better in each cycle, as well as the manipulations of beings with greater understanding of the universe (such as Mephisto), these memories can become unreliable; the overall thrust of events may be the same, but vital details might differ from his previous incarnation. When he forced Aleta to re-merge with him after their second separation, Starhawk's power changed from light to dark, and he was able to create constructs out of solid darkness, and fire blasts of shadowy force. Valentino had initially decided to call him Shadowhawk, but Tom DeFalco convinced him to save the name for a brand new character. Stakar has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet Arcturus IV. He also has extensive knowledge of various civilizations throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. His costume is made of alien materials, including a retracting transparent facemask and life support system, and retractable solar wind collector wings.

He first appears in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 who is acquainted with Yondu Udonta. Stakar was the one who saved Yondu from years of slavery by the Kree. He and Martinex T'Naga later run into Yondu on the planet Contraxia, where they remind him why he is in exile by mentioning how he broke the Ravagers' Code by trafficking children, a reference to the children of Ego, who had hired Yondu to deliver them to him, including Peter Quill. Stakar does not know that Yondu, having discovered the fate of the other children he had delivered to Ego, refused to deliver Peter Quill, and decided to keep him and raise him as his own son, and train as a Ravager thief. After Yondu ultimately sacrifices himself to save Quill and his comrades, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Stakar and Martinex are among the Ravagers that honor him at his funeral. In a mid-credits scene, Stakar and Martinex reunite with their old teammates Charlie-27, Aleta Ogord, Mainframe, and Krugarr. =Video games= Starhawk appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Superheroes 2 via DLC.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a chronic, specific granulomatous inflammation of the lymph node with caseation necrosis, caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related bacteria. The characteristic morphological element is the tuberculous granuloma (caseating tubercule). This consists of giant multinucleated cells and (Langhans cells), surrounded by epithelioid cells aggregates, T cell lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Granulomatous tubercules eventually develop central caseous necrosis and tend to become confluent, replacing the lymphoid tissue. Cause It is usually caused by the most common cause of tuberculosis in the lungs, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It has sometimes also been caused by related bacteria, including M. bovis, M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. marinum, and M. ulcerans. Symptoms In addition to swollen lymph nodes, called lymphadenitis, the person may experience mild fevers, not feel like eating, or lose weight. Stages Stages of tubercular lymphadenitis: # Lymphadenitis # Periadenitis # Cold abscess # 'Collar stud' abscess # Sinus Tuberculous lymphadenitis is popularly known as collar stud abscess, due to its proximity to the collar bone and its superficial resemblance to a collar stud, although this is just one of the five stages of the disease. One or more affected lymph nodes can also be in a different body part, although it is most typical to have at least one near the collar bone. The characteristic morphological element is the tuberculous granuloma (caseating tubercule): giant multinucleated cells (Langhans cells), surrounded by epithelioid cells aggregates, T cell lymphocytes and few fibroblasts. Granulomatous tubercules evolve to central caseous necrosis and tend to become confluent, replacing the lymphoid tissue. Diagnosis The diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis may require a biopsy.subscription required Other possible diagnostic steps include: positive tuberculin test, chest radiograph, CT scan, cytology/biopsy (FNAC), AFB staining, and mycobacterial culture. Treatment Drainage is not necessary if followed by anti-tubercular medication. Treatment with anti-tubercular medications normally lasts up to one year.

Anthophyllite is polymorphic with cummingtonite. Some forms of anthophyllite are lamellar or fibrous and are classed as asbestos. The name is derived from the Latin word anthophyllum, meaning clove, an allusion to the most common color of the mineral.  Occurrence  Anthophyllite is the product of metamorphism of magnesium-rich rocks, especially ultrabasic igneous rocks and impure dolomitic shales. It also forms as a retrograde product rimming relict orthopyroxenes and olivine, and as an accessory mineral in cordierite-bearing gneisses and schists. Anthophyllite also occurs as a retrograde metamorphic mineral derived from ultramafic rocks along with serpentinite.  Occurrence in ultramafic rocks  Anthophyllite is formed by the breakdown of talc in ultramafic rocks in the presence of water and carbon dioxide as a prograde metamorphic reaction. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (XCO2) in aqueous solution favors production of anthophyllite. Higher partial pressures of CO2 reduces the temperature of the anthophyllite-in isograd. Ultramafic rocks in purely hydrous, CO2-free environments will tend to form serpentinite-antigorite-brucite-tremolite assemblages (dependent on MgO content) or at amphibolite to granulite metamorphic grade, metamorphic pyroxene or olivine. Thus, metamorphic assemblages of ultramafic rocks containing anthophyllite are indicative of at least greenschist facies metamorphism in the presence of carbon dioxide bearing metamorphic fluids. The typical metamorphic assemblage reactions for low-magnesian (<25% MgO) and high-magnesian (>25% MgO) ultramafic rocks are; * Olivine + Tremolite + Talc → Olivine + Tremolite + Anthophyllite (low MgO, >550 °C, XCO2 <0.6) * Talc + Tremolite + Magnesite → Tremolite + Anthophyllite + Magnesite (High MgO, >500 °C, XCO2 >0.6) * Talc + Magnesite + Tremolite → Anthophyllite + Tremolite + Magnesite (Low MgO, >500 °C, XCO2 >0.6) Anthophyllite in serpentinised komatiite, Maggie Hays Ni Mine, Western Australia Retrogressive anthophyllite is relatively rare in ultramafic rocks and is usually poorly developed due to the lower energy state available for metamorphic reactions to progress and also the general dehydration of rock masses during metamorphism. Similarly, the need for substantial components of carbon dioxide in metamorphic fluid restricts the appearance of anthophyllite as a retrograde mineral. The usual metamorphic assemblage of retrograde-altered ultramafic rocks is thus usually a serpentinite or talc-magnesite assemblage. Retrograde anthophyllite is present most usually in shear zones where fracturing and shearing of the rocks provides a conduit for carbonated fluids during retrogression.  Fibrous anthophyllite  SEM micrograph) Fibrous anthophyllite is one of the six recognised types of asbestos. It was mined in Finland and also in Matsubase, Japan where a large-scale open-cast asbestos mine and mill was in operation between 1883 and 1970. In Finland anthophyllite asbestos was mined in two mines, the larger one Paakkila in the Tuusniemi commune started in 1918 and closed in 1975 due to the dust problems. The smaller mine, Maljasalmi in the commune of Outokumpu, was mined from 1944 to 1952. The anthophyllite was used in asbestos cement and for insulation, roofing material etc. Anthophyllite is also known as azbolen asbestos.

The former Stewart Air Force Base is also known as Newburgh-Stewart IAP and Stewart International Airport, while the military portion of this now-joint civil-military airport is known as Stewart Air National Guard Base (Stewart ANGB). The base is named in honor of 19th-century Scottish-born sea captain, Lachlan Stewart, and his son, who donated the land it now occupies. Overview Located in the Town of Newburgh, New York. The 105th Airlift Wing's mission is to provide peacetime and wartime inter-theater airlift operations using the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. Newburgh is approximately north of New York City, NY and due south of Albany, the capital of New York State. The air national guard base encompasses 267 acres (107 ha) and contains 36 buildings, amounting to approximately 757,000 square feet (68,130 m2). There is no family or transient military housing, with military personnel residing outside of a radius normally being billeted in nearby hotels and motels under military contract arrangements. Units The day-to-day military population of Stewart ANGB is approximately 660 full-time Air National Guard personnel, both Air Reserve Technician (ART) and Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) personnel, plus approximately 150 additional active duty Army, AGR Army Reserve and AGR Army National Guard, active duty Marine Corps and Active Reserve Marine Corps personnel. This is further augmented on a daily basis by a fluctuating number of over 3,000 additional traditional, part-time Air National Guard, Army National Guard, Army Reserve and Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) personnel. Because of the operational flying missions, most of the personnel of the Air National Guard, the Army National Guard, the Army Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve are funded for, and perform, additional military duty in either a drilling status or an active duty status far in excess of the typical ground-based reserve or national guard unit. For example, on at least one weekend each month, the 105 AW's population surges to over 1,600 personnel in response to the monthly required Air National Guard unit training assembly (UTA), attended by nearly all of the 105 AW's personnel. In 1988, the United States Marine Corps became a tenant of the Stewart ANGB with the establishment of Marine Air Refueler and Transport Squadron FOUR FIVE TWO (VMGR-452), along with Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 49 (MALS-49) and Marine Aircraft Group 49 (MAG-49), Detachment Bravo. A Marine Corps Reserve unit of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, VMGR-452 has operated KC-130T Hercules aircraft available for worldwide tasking in support of Marine Expeditionary Forces and combatant commanders and is transitioning to the KC-130J Hercules. Stewart Army Subpost and the Stewart-Newburgh Armed Forces Reserve Center are also located on Stewart ANGB. The former supports the U.S. Military Academy, the 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment (1-1 INF BN) and the UH-72 Lakota-equipped 2nd Aviation Detachment (2ND AVN DET), while the latter supports the consolidation of several smaller and obsolescent U.S. Army Reserve Centers and New York Army National Guard Armories throughout the Hudson River Valley, colocating their associated units at a single site with modern training facilities. The U.S. Army Reserve also maintains the Stewart- Newburgh Armed Forces Reserve Center on the installation. In November 2010, it was announced that the Air Force had selected Stewart ANGB as its \\"preferred base\\" for eight C-17 Globemaster III jet cargo aircraft slated to be operated by the Air National Guard for the Air Mobility Command, with the twelve C-5A Galaxy cargo aircraft operated by the 105 AW at the base to be retired and replaced by the C-17s. In March 2011, Air Force officials announced that the 105 AW had been chosen as the final basing decision for eight C-17 Globemaster III mobility aircraft. The 105 AW's first C-17, AF Ser. No. 05-0105, arrived on July 1, 2011 and the wing commenced retiring their C-5 aircraft and transitioning to the C-17.105th Airlift Wing, New York Air National Guard - History . 105aw.ang.af.mil.

A GEL pertains to organizations that have been recognized by the IRS as tax exempt organizations. Many organizations in the United States maintain a GEL and obtaining one can be of benefit to an organization. Overview According to the IRS, a Group Exemption Letter is a ruling or determination letter that is issued to a central organization recognizing, on a group basis, the exemption from Federal income tax under of subordinate organizations on whose behalf the central organization has applied for recognition of exemption. To obtain a GEL, the central organization must have first applied for and received its own 501(c)(3) Exemption Determination Letter recognizing its 501(c)(3) Tax Exemption status. Once the central organization has received its determination letter and has at least one subordinate wishing to operate under its exemption, then it is time to file for the GEL. Each year, the central organization submits a list of subordinate organizations to be included in the next year's GEL. Benefits By obtaining a Group Exemption Letter, the central organization is able to pass along, to its subordinates, its tax exemption status, thus, making the subordinate organizations eligible to be claimed as a 501(c)(3) organization under the same status as the central organization. If the central organization is recognized as a 501(c)(3), then all the subordinates are also considered 501(c)(3), as long as they follow the required guidelines set by the central organization. By being included in the Group Exemption Letter, the subordinates do not have to file an application for exemption, and can accept donations that are tax-deductible under the law. A major benefit is that a subordinate does not have to pay the fees to obtain an exemption letter.

They may be sensitive military establishments or secret research installations that require much more space or freedom than is available in a conventional military base. There may also be a wider variety of permanent residents including close family members of workers or trusted traders who are not directly connected with its clandestine purposes. Many closed cities existed in the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. After 1991, a number of them still existed in the CIS countries, especially Russia. In modern Russia, such places are officially known as \\"closed administrative- territorial formations\\" (, zakrytye administrativno-territorial'nye obrazovaniya, or ZATO for short). Structure and operations Zheleznogorsk, in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia Sometimes closed cities may only be represented on classified maps that are not available to the general public. In some cases there may be no road signs or directions to closed cities, and they are usually omitted from railroad time tables and bus routes. Sometimes closed cities may be indicated obliquely as a nearby insignificant village, with the name of the stop serving the closed city made equivocal or misleading. For mail delivery, a closed city is usually named as the nearest large city and a special postcode e.g. Arzamas‑16, Chelyabinsk‑65. The actual settlement can be rather distant from its namesakes; for instance, Sarov, designated Arzamas-16, is in the federal republic of Mordovia, whereas Arzamas is in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (roughly away). People not living in a closed city were subject to document checks and security checkpoints, and explicit permission was required for them to visit. To relocate to a closed city, one would need security clearance by the organization running it, such as the KGB in Soviet closed cities. Closed cities were sometimes guarded by a security perimeter with barbed wire and towers. The very fact of such a city's existence was often classified, and residents were expected not to divulge their place of residence to outsiders. This lack of freedom was often compensated by better housing conditions and a better choice of goods in retail trade than elsewhere in the country. Also, in the Soviet Union, people working with classified information received a salary bonus. Soviet closed cities Map indicating federal subjects containing closed cities used for nuclear research and development Closed cities were established in the Soviet Union from the late 1940s onwards under the euphemistic name of \\"post boxes\\", referring to the practice of addressing post to them via mail boxes in other cities. They fell into two distinct categories. # The first category comprised relatively small communities with sensitive military, industrial, or scientific facilities, such as arms plants or nuclear research sites.\\"Secret Cities\\". GlobalSecurity.org. Accessed August 2011. Examples are the modern towns of Ozyorsk (Chelyabinsk-65) with a plutonium production plant, and Sillamäe, the site of a uranium enrichment facility. Even Soviet citizens were not allowed access to these places without proper authorization. In addition to this, some bigger cities were closed for unauthorized access to foreigners, while they were freely accessible to Soviet citizens. These included cities like Perm, a center for Soviet artillery, munitions, and also aircraft engines production, and Vladivostok, the headquarters and primary base of the Soviet Pacific Fleet. # The second category consisted of border cities (and some whole border areas, such as the Kaliningrad Oblast, Saaremaa, and Hiiumaa), which were closed for security purposes. Comparable closed areas existed elsewhere in the Eastern bloc; a substantial area along the inner German border and the border between West Germany and Czechoslovakia was placed under similar restrictions (although by the 1970s foreigners could cross the latter by train). Citizens were required to have special permits to enter such areas. The locations of the first category of the closed cities were chosen for their geographical characteristics. They were often established in remote places situated deep in the Urals and Siberia, out of reach of enemy bombers. They were built close to rivers and lakes that were used to provide the large amounts of water needed for heavy industry and nuclear technology. Existing civilian settlements in the vicinity were often used as sources of construction labour. Although the closure of cities originated as a strictly temporary measure that was to be normalized under more favorable conditions, in practice the closed cities took on a life of their own and became a notable institutional feature of the Soviet system.Victor Zaslavsky, \\"Ethnic group divided: social stratification and nationality policy in the Soviet Union\\", p. 224, in Peter Joseph Potichnyj, The Soviet Union: Party and Society, Cambridge University Press, 1988. . Movement to and from closed areas was tightly controlled. Foreigners were prohibited from entering them and local citizens were under stringent restrictions. They had to have special permission to travel there or leave, and anyone seeking residency was required to undergo vetting by the NKVD and its successor agencies. Access to some closed cities was physically enforced by surrounding them with barbed wire fences monitored by armed guards. =The \\"mailbox\\"= \\"Mailbox\\" was the unofficial name of a secret Soviet facility much like the closed city, but smaller, usually the size of a factory. The \\"mailbox\\" name was usually classified, as were the activities there. Incoming mail was addressed to \\"Mailbox #XXXX\\", thus the name of \\"mailbox\\". Most Soviet design bureaus (OKB) for weapons, aircraft, space technology, military electronics, etc. were \\"mailboxes\\". Closed cities in post-Soviet statesRussia= A view of Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, Russia, which is home to the Northern Fleet. Russia has the largest number of closed cities. The policy of closing cities underwent major changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some cities, such as Perm, were opened well before the fall of the Soviet Union; others, such as Kaliningrad and Vladivostok, remained closed until as late as 1992. The adoption of a new constitution for the Russian Federation in 1993 prompted significant reforms to the status of closed cities, which were renamed \\"closed administrative-territorial formations\\" (or ZATO, after the Russian acronym). Municipally all such entities have a status of urban okrugs, as mandated by the federal law. There are currently 44 publicly acknowledged closed cities in Russia with a total population of about 1.5 million people. 75% are administered by the Russian Ministry of Defense, with the rest being administered by Rosatom.Nadezhda Kutepova & Olga Tsepilova, \\"A short history of the ZATO\\", pp. 148–149, in Cultures of Contamination, Volume 14: Legacies of Pollution in Russia and the US (Research in Social Problems and Public Policy), editors Michael Edelstein, Maria Tysiachniouk, Lyudmila V. Smirnova. JAI Press, 2007. Another 15 or so closed cities are believed to exist, but their names and locations have not been publicly disclosed by the Russian government.Greg Kaser, \\"Motivation and Redirection: Rationale and Achievements in the Russian Closed Nuclear Cities\\", p. 3, in Countering Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism, editors David J. Diamond, Samuel Apikyan, Greg Kaser. Springer, 2006. Some Russian closed cities are open for foreign investment, but foreigners may only enter with a permit. An example is the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI), a joint effort of the United States National Nuclear Security Administration and Minatom, which involves in part the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk. The number of closed cities has been significantly reduced since the mid-1990s. However, on 30 October 2001, foreign travel (without any exceptions) was restricted in the northern cities of Norilsk, Talnakh, Kayerkan, Dudinka, and Igarka. Russian and Belarusian citizens visiting these cities are not required to have any permits; however, local courts are known to deport Belarusian citizens in contradiction with the federal Constitution.

As with all the other industrial cities, the population of them was mainly Russian-speaking. Sillamäe was the site for a chemical factory that produced fuel rods and nuclear materials for the Soviet nuclear power plants and nuclear weapon facilities, while Paldiski was home to a Soviet Navy nuclear submarine training centre. Sillamäe was closed until Estonia regained its independence in 1991; Paldiski remained closed until 1994, when the last Russian warship left. Tartu, home to Raadi Airfield, was partially closed.

Some tourism organisations in Kazakhstan provide services in organising trips to visit Baikonur and the museums contained there. *Priozersk, Kazakhstan Former closed cities *Kurchatov, Kazakhstan – was previously known by its postal code, Semipalatinsk-21. =Moldova= Moldova has one official closed city – the commune Cobasna (Rîbnița District) in the disputed area of Transnistria. The commune, located on the left bank of the Dniester river, still contains military warehouses of the former Soviet 14th Army. =Ukraine= Ukraine had eighteen closed cities: among them the Crimean port of Sevastopol and the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk, though both were restricted to foreigners, not locals. Travel restrictions were lifted in the mid-1990s. *Simferopol-28, Crimea – former closed town, a Soviet military space mission control center. *Feodosia-13, Crimea – former closed town, a central storage of nuclear weapons. In other countriesAlbania= During the period of communist rule in Albania, the towns of Çorovodë and Qyteti Stalin (now Kuçovë) were closed cities with a military airport, military industry and other critical war infrastructure. = China = * No.404 Factory of China National Nuclear Corporation (中国核工业总公司第四零四厂), then the Ministry of Nuclear Industry, located in the Gobi desert in western part of Gansu province, is a closed town often called the nuclear town (核城). It is the biggest nuclear industry base in China and it was built in 1958. China built its first military nuclear reactor there and 80% of the core parts for China's nuclear bombs were produced there. Until the 1980s, the whole town was closed to outsiders. A nuclear accident happened in 1969, involving a leak. The name \\"mine area of Gansu\\" (甘肃矿区) was used for secrecy. In 2007, most residents were moved to nearby Jiayuguan City. *Some remote areas in China, such as Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County (except Laoye Mountain), Huangzhong County (except Kumbum Monastery), and Huangyuan County around Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, maintain travel restrictions for foreigners. A foreigner must apply for an alien travel document (外国人旅行证) in advance, and report their accommodation to local police within 24 hours after entering the area. Similarly, all foreign visitors to the Tibet Area must be part of a tour group to be permitted access. = Hong Kong = A signboard for the Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong The Frontier Closed Area (FCA) is a fenced stretch of land along the northern border of Hong Kong, which serves as a buffer between the closed border and the rest of the territory. For anyone to enter the area, a Closed Area Permit is required. Between 1951 and 2012, it contained dozens of villages over an area of 28 square kilometres. Upon several stages of reduction, by 2016, the border town of Sha Tau Kok remains as the only settlement within the FCA. =Korea= Within the Korean Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea, are two \\"peace villages\\" (one maintained by each nation): Daeseong-dong (South) and (possibly) Kijŏng-dong (North). Access by non-residents to Daeseong-dong requires a military escort, while Kijŏng-dong is not accessible to visitors. Korea, North The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center sits within a closed city that occupies 24.8 square kilometres (9.6 sq mi). = Mexico = * In Baja California, the communities on Guadalupe Island (such as Campo Oeste) can be considered closed towns; because Guadalupe Island is located in a Biosphere Reserve, the Mexican government requires special permits in order to visit the island.http://islas.org.mx/index.php?mod=proy&op;=islagua Islas.org.mx.

Au is a blogger and activist who provides analyses of Singaporean politics, culture, gay issues and miscellaneous subjects on his blog. He is also the co-author of two books, People Like Us: Sexual Minorities in Singapore and a French-language treatise on homophobia entitled L'Homophobie. He was the owner of Rairua, Singapore's first nude gay sauna. Biography Au, of Cantonese descent, was born in Singapore in 1952. He attended the Anglo-Chinese School for his primary and secondary education and obtained his tertiary degree from the National University of Singapore. After graduation, he worked in a managerial position at a British multinational corporation before branching out on his own as the proprietor of several business catering to the gay community, as well as freelance writing.Fridae bibliography He was one of the founding members, along with Joseph Lo and Dr. Russell Heng, of Singapore's main gay equality lobby group People Like Us, and also the founder and list owner of the Singapore Gay News List (SiGNeL), the first discussion forum for Singapore's gay community. In 2002, he was presented with the Utopia award for outstanding contributions towards the advancement of gay equality in Asia. In July 2003, Au was identified by the now-defunct Channel i as a gay activist. His views were solicited in the wake of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent announcement that the hiring of gays in the civil service would henceforth be liberalized. In the run-up to the 2006 Singapore general election, Au provided extensive coverage of the opposition parties' rallies which were attended by large crowds. Au used his connections with People Like Us and with leading practitioners in the local gay arts scene to organize IndigNation, Singapore's first gay pride month in 2005 and Short Circuit, Singapore's first gay film festival in 2006. In July 2012, the attorney general's chambers wrote to Au, demanding that he take down and apologize for a June 2012 post in his Yawning Bread blog that criticized the judiciary for showing deference to the executive. Au promptly removed the post. In October 2014, Senior State Counsel Tai Wei Shyong, acting for the attorney-general, urged the High Court to hold Au in contempt of court for two Yawning Bread articles that made it seem that there is a \\"systemic bias\\" in Singapore's judiciary against cases involving homosexuality. In his defence, Au's lawyers, Peter Low and Choo Zheng Xi, accused the AG of being \\"trigger-happy\\" in taking their client to court on \\"imputation, innuendo and insinuation\\". On 22 January 2015, Au was held to be guilty of scandalising the court in respect of one of his two Yawning Bread articles, and cleared of the second charge. The Court of Appeal rejected his appeal on 1 December 2015.http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts- crime/blogger-alex-au-found-guilty-of-court-contempt-for-one-of-two-articles ReferencesExternal links * The Yawning Bread website * Alex Au web picture archive * The Yawning Bread blog Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Singaporean people of Cantonese descent Category:National University of Singapore alumni Category:Anglo-Chinese School alumni Category:Gay writers Category:LGBT people from Singapore Category:LGBT rights activists from Singapore Category:Singaporean writers Category:Singaporean bloggers Category:Male bloggers ","title":"Alex Au"},{"id":"1627524","text":"Samantha Elizabeth Brown (born March 31, 1970), is an American television host, notable for her work as the host of several Travel Channel shows including Girl Meets Hawaii, Great Vacation Homes, Great Hotels, Passport to Europe, Passport to Latin America, Great Weekends, Green Getaways, Passport to China, and Samantha Brown's Asia.

As a travel host, Brown travels 230 days out of the year and takes eight days to film an hour- long episode.

He was Prime Minister again from 5 May 1945 to 7 November 1945 as head of a unity government (the Cabinet of Vilhelm Buhl II) after the liberation of Denmark by the British Field Marshal Montgomery. Vilhelm Buhl was a member of the Social Democrats. He joined the party while a law student at the University of Copenhagen. Buhl held the post of Finance Minister in the cabinets of Thorvald Stauning from 20 July 1937 to 4 May 1942. During Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark, Thorvald Stauning had created a unity government. When Thorvald Stauning died in May 1942, Vilhelm Buhl succeeded him. This government only lasted six months, because of a diplomatic incident, the Telegram Crisis, in which King Christian X sent a short and formal reply to a long birthday telegram from Adolf Hitler. Hitler was outraged by this insult, and as a result Vilhelm Buhl was replaced by Erik Scavenius. Werner Best was sent to Denmark as a new tough Nazi commander. After the liberation of Denmark on 5 May 1945, the politicians and the resistance fighters formed a unity government (Cabinet of Vilhelm Buhl II). Many Danes were dissatisfied with the politicians because of their policy of cooperation with the Germans that had dominated at the start of the war, hence the inclusion of the resistance fighters. Notable members of the cabinet included Aksel Larsen, Hans Hedtoft, H. C. Hansen, Knud Kristensen and John Christmas Møller. In social policy, the government presided over the passage of the Housing Obligation Act of August 1945, introduced obligatory allocation of vacant housing to ensure that vacant flats were let in the first instance to those with low incomes, while also establishing tight rent controls. The government also presided over the trials of the people who had cooperated with the Germans, as a result of which 45 persons were executed. After the elections in October 1945 Knud Kristensen became the new prime minister.

BiographyEarly life and studies= Arnaud d'Ossat, son of Bernard d'Ossat, was perhaps born at Larroque-Magnoac in Gascony; a contract entered into by M. Arnaud d'Ossat on 22 April 1559 states that he was from La Nogue en Maignac.Marie-Genevieve Charlotte Darfus Theroux, Vie du Cardinal d'Ossat (Paris: Chez Herissant 1771) I, pp. 2-3. La Nogue is probably a corrupt reading of Larroque. His mother, Bertrande de Conté, was a native of Cassignebere in Gascony, the property of the Lords of Ramefort. Hence the conjecture (which goes back to Scipion Dupleix' Histoire d' Henri IV of 1635) that Armand was the bastard son of the Lord of Ramefort.This conjecture seems to be without documentary foundation, a poor basis on which to label Mme. d'Ossat an adultress and M. d'Ossat a cuckold. Bastardy, moreover, would have required a papal dispensation for taking Holy Orders. Dupleix seems to be trying to supply a mythical noble bloodline for the brilliant son of a blacksmith. See Antoine Degert, Le cardinal d'Ossat (Paris: Victor Lecoffre 1894), p. 3. Many of the important connections in Ossat's life were with other southerners, the most prominent being Henri IV himself. On 26 December 1556, he was received into the clergy, by being tonsured by Dominique de Bigorre, Bishop of Albi, administrator of the Diocese of Auch in the name of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este (1551-1563).Degert, p. 5. He was sent first to the nearby College of Auch as tutor to the sons of a local merchant, Thomas de Marca, then, in the first week of May, 1559, to the Collège de France, Paris.Degert, p. 6. There he studied rhetoric and philosophy for more than two years with the famous humanist logician and mathematician Petrus Ramus, who became his friend. He was unfortunately drawn into an academic disputeExpositio Arnaldi Ossati in disputationem Jacobi Carpentarii de Methodo (Parisiis: Apud Andream Wechelum 1564), 16pp. Arnaldi Ossati Additio ad expositionem de methodo (Parisiis: apud A. Wechselum 1564), 20 pp. between his master Ramus and the famous Jacques Charpentier, Rector, Dean, Censor, and finally (in his victory over Ramus) Professor of Medicine and Mathematics at the College Royale (1566).César Du Boulay, Historia Universitatis Parisiensis VI (Paris 1673), p. 941. J.-A. Hazon, Notice des hommes les plus célèbres de la Faculté de Medicine dans l' Université de Paris (Paris 1778), pp. 61-62. Charpentier was an Aristotelian and a vigorous persecutor of heretics, while Ramus was a humanist and an Augustinian, and therefore suspect. Seeing his own reputation and prospects diminishing as a result of the quarrel, Ossat withdrew to Bourges at the end of 1565 or beginning of 1566. He studied law briefly at Bourges under the famous legist Jacques Cujas, though his legal studies ultimately filled more than two years.Degert, p. 14. He was back in Paris by 8 September 1568, when he wrote to his mother that he was going to practice as an advocate before the Parlement of Paris.Degert, p. 14. Around the same time he agreed to act as a director of the studies of the twenty-three year old Jean de la Barrière, the abbot of the Feuillants and its eventual reformer,See: The Religious of the Congregation des Feuillants [Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Anne], La conduite de Dom Jean de la Barrière, premier abbé et instituteur des Feuillans (Paris: François H. Muguet 1699), p. 5. who was eager for guidance in the pursuit of an ecclesiastical career. =Early Diplomatic Career= In 1572 he joined the household of Paul de Foix, Archbishop-elect of Toulouse since 1577,Gallia christiana XIII (Paris 1785), 58-59. whom he accompanied on various embassies.Oddly, due to his extremely moderate view of the treatment of the Huguenots, Paul de Foix had spent time in prison under the displeasure of the King, and then kept out of France by being sent on embassies. He was ambassador to Scotland and then England in 1561 for a four year term, to Venice in 1565-1570, and again to England for the embarrassing negotiations for the marriage of Queen Elizabeth with the Duc d'Alençon; he was back in France in 1572. Degert, 23. One of these was certainly the Embassy to Poland for the accession of the Duc d'Anjou as King of Poland in 1573.Degert, p. 24. Immediately after that mission, allegedly to thank all the princes of Italy for their felicitations on the election, King Charles IX sent Foix on an embassy to Italy; the instructions were issued on 7 October 1573.Degert, p. 24. D' Ossat again accompanied him.Vie du Cardinal d'Ossat, in Amelot de la Houssaie Letres du Cardinal d'Ossat I (Paris: Jean Boudot, 1698), pp. 18-20. Their reception at the Papal Curia was not what they had expected. Despite his diplomatic status, Foix found himself under interrogation for his actions and opinions during the events of 1559 leading to the Edict against heresy of 2 June. His orthodoxy was ably defended by d'Ossat in a memoire composed for his defense.Degert, pp. 25-26 However, only too aware of the views and intrigues of his fellow cardinals, Cardinal Prospero Santacroce advised his friend Foix to depart from Rome before any further proceedings could take place.Vie du Cardinal d'Ossat, in Amelot de la Houssaie Letres du Cardinal d'Ossat I (Paris: Jean Boudot, 1698), p. 20. The story of the Roman legation is also related by Jacques-Auguste de Thou, Memoires de la vie de Jacques-Auguste de Thou (Rotterdam: Reinier Leers 1711), pp. 25-32. The death of Charles IX on 30 May 1574 provided the appropriate opportunity. D' Ossat accompanied Msgr. de Foix again on his mission to Rome (1582-1584), where the Archbishop was granted his bulls on 5 November and his pallium on 15 December 1582.Gulick- Eubel Hierarchia catholica editio altera (Monasterii 1923), p. 315. Pierre La Croix, Mémoire historique sur les institutions de la France à Rome (2nd edition par Jean Arnaud) (Rome 1892) p. 155. Letters of the Archbishop in Rome to the King in France survive.Les lettres de Messire Paul de Foix, Archevesque de Tolose, et Ambassadeur pour le Roy auprés du Pape Gregoire XIII escrites au Roy Henry III (Paris: Charles Chappelain 1628). They are preceded by a French translation of the Funeral Oration of Marc Antoine Muret. The next Ambassador Ordinary was the Marquis Pitany, who was not received until 1592, after some struggle; this long delay of eight years was due to the irregular status of Henri IV as an heretic; a pope could not enter into direct friendly relations with an heretic, and Sixtus V was violently opposed to Henri IV; he had also excommunicated Henri III for allowing the murders of the Duc de Guise and the Cardinal de Lorraine in 1589. Therefore, after Msgr. de Foix died in Rome on 29 May 1584, d'Ossat remained at the Papal Court in Rome, supervising the French embassy for a year, to the evident satisfaction of King Henri III and Secretary Villeroy, who presented him with a gift of 2,000 ecus on 18 July 1586. They were evidently impressed by the report of the Bishop of Paris, Pierre de Gondi, who had been in Rome in early 1586, attempting to smooth over difficulties between Pope Sixtus V and the French Ambassador Marquis Pitany.Degert, p. 36. D'Ossat then became secretary to Cardinal Luigi d'Este, the Protector of France before the Holy See, who, unfortunately, died on 30 December 1586. He was succeeded a month later, on 16 February 1587,Amelot de Houssaye (ed.), Letres du Cardinal d' Ossat II (Amsterdam 1708), Letre XLV (16 February 1596), pp. 30-31. by Cardinal François de Joyeuse, who took charge of French affairs upon his arrival in Rome on 20 August 1587, and who also enjoyed Ossat's services as secretary. Ossat was ordained to the priesthood around this time, perhaps at the end of 1587; Jacques de Thou wrote that Ossat had written a letter to Henri III in 1588 that he had received ordination.Degert, p. 40. In 1588 he refused the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs to Henry III, after the King had dismissed all of his secretaries of state, including Villeroy. The refusal was made, no doubt, out of a sense of loyalty to his friend and patron, Villeroy. Then, the Cardinal de Joyeuse and d' Ossat were driven from Rome by the rupture of diplomatic relations with the Pope after the murder of Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (1588), but they returned after the murder of Henry III on 2 August 1589 by the Dominican friar Jacques Clément. D'Ossat thereupon undertook to serve as the private agent) procurator) in Rome of the widowed queen, Louise de Vaudemont.Twenty- four of D'Ossat's letters to Queen Louise, written between 1590 and 1600, can be found near the beginning of Volume I of the Letres du Cardinal d'Ossat, edited by Abraham-Nicolas Amelot de la Houssaie (Paris: Jean Boudot, 1698). =Ossat, Henri IV, and Rome= He used his unofficial position to support the cause of Henry IV, whose conversion to Catholicism he prepared Pope Clement VIII to accept. On 1 August 1593, Henri IV wrote directly to d' Ossat in Rome that he was sending the Duc de Nevers to negotiate with the Pope, and he instructed d'Ossat to share all of his knowledge of and influence in the Roman Court, as well as his wise counsel, to advance the affairs of France.Berger de Xivrey (ed.), Recueil des lettres missives de Henri IV Tome IV (Paris 1848), pp. 20-21. Shortly before the arrival of Nevers in Rome, the French faced the verbal onslaught of a Spanish chamberlain of the Pope, Gonzalez Ponce de Leon, in the form of a memoire arguing that the pope did not have the authority to absolve a relapsed heretic (such as Henri IV). When it appeared that Clement VIII was impressed by the arguments, D' Ossat undertook to reply to the Spanish chamberlain in a memoire of his own. The arguments, summarized by de Thou in his history,Jacques-Auguste de Thou, Iac. Augusti Thuani Historiarum sui temporis continuatio. Pars Quarta, ab a.C.n. 1585 usqye ad Annum 1595 (Francofurti: Peter Kopf 1621), pp.1298-1304; and in French translation Histoire universelle, Livre CVII, capitulum xii. In the edition published in The Hague by Henri Scheuerleer in 1740, the passage is in Volume VIII, pp. 314-315. Degert, p. 81. convinced the Pope, who, in the end, preferred to believe that he had more power than less power. Unofficial negotiations therefore continued. As Envoy Extraordinary for Henri,Pierre La Croix, Mémoire historique sur les institutions de la France à Rome (2nd edition par Jean Arnaud) (Rome 1892) p. 155. Abel Desjardins, Une Congrégation générale des cardinaux en 1595 (Douai: Lucien Crepin 1875), passim. cooperating with Jacques Davy du Perron, Bishop of Évreux, he negotiated the reconciliation of the King with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope, which took place on 19 September 1595. This was the greatest act of d'Ossat's diplomatic career, assuring as it did the definitive triumph of Henri IV over the House of Guise and the Catholic League, and the restoration of peace to France after more than thirty years of civil war (see French Wars of Religion). =Episcopate= In January 1596, King Henri IV named d' Ossat Bishop of Rennes. The bishop's letter of thanks to the King is dated 20 February 1596.Lettre XLVI (ed. Amelot de Houssaye). It was not until the Consistory of Monday, 9 September 1596, however, that Pope Clement VIII authorized the issue of the appropriate bulls authorizing his consecration.Letter LXXX, p. 313. He was consecrated in Rome on Sunday, 27 October, in the Church of S. Marco, by Cardinal Agostino Valier, Bishop of Verona.\\"Vie du Cardinal d'Ossat\\", in Amelot de Houssaye, Letres I (Paris 1698), p. 9; and Lettre LXXXVIII, p. 553. The co-consecrators were Guillaume d'Avançon, Archbishop of Embrun, and Francesco Serini, Bishop of Bagnoregio . Ossat remained at Rome, without any well-defined office, though he was charged with occasional missions to Venice and Florence (1598), and managed the French embassy in the absence of a noble ambassador, as professional diplomats traditionally do, and was always the enlightened and devoted representative of French interests. All the ambassadors of Henry IV had orders to make known to him the business with which they were charged and to be guided by his advice. Villeroy, Henri's minister of foreign affairs, himself consulted him on all matters in any way connected with Rome. Ossat was pleased to be notified, by a letter and brevet of 6 September 1597, that King Henri IV had named him a Councillor of State.Amelot de Houssaye, Letres II (Amsterdam 1708), Letre CXVI, pp. 485-489 (to the King, 18 October 1597). =Cardinalate= He was created cardinal priest, on the recommendation of King Henri IV of France, in the consistory of 3 March 1599. Later, in the Consistory of 17 March 1599, he was granted the title of S. Eusebio. Ossat was also promoted to the Diocese of Bayeux, a richer and more prestigious benefice, on 26 June 1600. On 4 August 1600, he took possession of the diocese through his procurator, Pierre Ruel, Councillor of the Parlement of Paris, but he never visited his new diocese in person.Gallia christiana Volume XI, pp. 390-393. Only one week before his death, he received permission from the King to relinquish his episcopal throne. A measure of Ossat's skill and tact may be gained by the French measures he was able to present successfully to the Holy See: the expulsion of the Jesuits from France, the indefinite postponement of the publication of the decrees of the Council of Trent, the Edict of Nantes, and French alliances with England and even with the Sultan of Turkey, the annulment of Henry IV's marriage with Margaret of Valois, and the marriage of the Duc de Bar with Catherine of Navarre, the king's sister and an unrepentant Calvinist. At the same time d'Ossat used his influence at Rome for the benefit of French humanists: the historian Jacques-Auguste de Thou (witness to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacres), the philosopher Michel de Montaigne, and the savant Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc. =Death= Cardinal d'Ossat died on 13 March 1604 (his tombstone says 14 March) in Rome, after brief illness. He was buried in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi, near the Piazza Navona. His tomb is still to be seen, though the inscription is a substitute, ca. 1763, for the original, which was destroyed during renovations of the church.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chiese di Roma III (Roma 1873), p. 32 no. 82 (original); p. 54 no. 139 (substitute). Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio (1579-1644) said of him that never was a man more worthy of the cardinal's hat, because of his religious zeal, the integrity of his morals, and the eminence of his learning.Bentivoglio, Mémoires. In the course of his diplomatic career Ossat wrote many letters and memoranda,Abraham-Nicolas Amelot de la Houssaie (editor), Letres du Cardinal d' Ossat. Nouvelle edition, corrigée sur le manuscrit original et notablement augmentée, avec des notes historiques et politiques 5 vols (Paris 1698). a selection of which, printed in 1614, long served as models for diplomats, owing not only to the importance of the questions which they treat but especially to the talent for exposition which Ossat displays in them. The Académie Française inscribed Ossat among the \\"dead authors who have written our French language most purely\\", and Lord Chesterfield wrote to his son that the \\"simplicity and clearness of Cardinal d'Ossat's letters show how business letters should be written\\".

Area code 312 is the telephone area code for downtown Chicago, which includes the Chicago Loop and its immediate environs. The plan area is completely surrounded by area code 773, which serves the rest of Chicago. Both area codes are overlaid with area code 872. 312 is an enclave area code, similar to area code 514 in Montreal and area code 210 in San Antonio. It is roughly bounded by North Avenue on the north, Western Avenue on the west, and 35th Street on the south, with Lake Michigan to the east. In terms of geographic area covered, 312 is one of the smallest area codes in the nation, encompassing only a few square miles. History The original numbering plan area 312, as of 1947-1989 Area code 312 was assigned to one of the original 86 numbering plan areas (NPAs) created in 1947 for the North American Numbering Plan. As a result of Illinois' dense population, particularly in the north, the state was split between four NPAs, given that each NPA could only accommodate approximately 500 central offices.AT&T; (1955), Notes on Nationwide Dialing Area code 312 originally served almost all of the Chicago metropolitan area in Illinois, except for portions of Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, McHenry, and Will counties located in the numbering plan area of the rest of northern Illinois, 815. On November 11, 1989, the suburbs were assigned area code 708 and 312 was reduced to Chicago. The 1989 split was intended as a long-term solution to relieve exchanges in one of the largest toll-free calling zones in the nation. However, within only five years, 312 was on the verge of exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones, pagers and fax machines in the 1990s. Additionally, the Chicago LATA extends into northwest Indiana, meaning several numbers in Indiana's 219 weren't available for use. This factor also forced 708 to be split in 1996, just seven years after it split from 312. 708 was retained for the southern suburbs, while the northern suburbs became 847 and the western suburbs became 630. As a solution, all of the city outside of the downtown area was split off as area code 773 on October 11, 1996, making Chicago one of the few cities in the nation to be split between multiple area codes, along with New York City and Los Angeles. Since November 7, 2009, both 312 and 773 have been overlaid by 872. With the implementation of 872, even local calls in Chicago require 10-digit dialing, in addition to the prefix '1' (but not for cellphones). The Illinois side of the Chicago area–312/773/872, 708, 847/224, 630/331 and portions of 815/779–is one of the largest local calling areas in the United States; with few exceptions, no long-distance charges are applied from one portion of the metro area to the other.Local calling guide: Chicago Zone 01: Calumet, IL The first production #4ESS toll switch was installed in Chicago in January 1976.Telephone World In popular culture *Goose Island Brewery brews an ale named \\"312 Urban Wheat Ale\\" and \\"312 Urban Pale Ale\\". *A restaurant at the Kimpton Hotels operated Hotel Allegro, at LaSalle and Randolph Streets in the Loop, is named \\"312 Chicago\\". * The Chicago-based Christian rock group Resurrection Band released a song called \\"Area 312\\" on their 1982 album DMZ * Portions of the film RoboCop 2 were filmed in the Chicago area.

It was formed in June 1993 by the demerger of the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals businesses of Imperial Chemical Industries into a separate company listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 1999, Zeneca and the Sweden-based pharmaceutical company Astra AB merged to form AstraZeneca plc. Zeneca's largest therapeutic area was oncology, in which its key products included Casodex, Nolvadex and Zoladex. Other key products included heart drug Tenormin. Name \\"Zeneca\\" was an invented name created by the branding consultancy Interbrand. Interbrand had been instructed to find a name which began with a letter from either the top or bottom of the alphabet and was phonetically memorable, of no more than three syllables and did not have an offensive meaning in any language. History In December 1994, Zeneca agreed the acquisition of 50% of Salick Health Care, an operator of cancer care centres in the United States, in a transaction which valued Salick at US$440 million. Zeneca announced the sale of its textile colours business to the German group BASF in May 1996. Zeneca announced it would purchase the remaining 50% of Salick Health Care that it did not already own on 28 March 28 1997. In December 1997, Zeneca acquired the US fungicide operations of Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, along with the international distribution rights to four recently developed fungicides, herbicides and pest control products, for US$500 million. In May 1998, Zeneca announced that Tom McKillop, then the head of its drugs division, would succeed Sir David Barnes as chief executive, with Barnes becoming non- executive chairman of the company. In November 1998, Zeneca announced that it would sell its Zeneca Specialties division, including its biocides, industrial colours, life science molecules, performance and intermediate chemicals and resins activities. On 11 December 1998, Zeneca and Astra AB announced a £48 billion merger. In February 1999, it was reported that Zeneca would sue the US Food and Drug Administration over its decision to allow Gensia Sicor to produce a generic version of its anaesthetic Diprivan. The merger between Zeneca and Astra AB was completed in April 1999, forming AstraZeneca plc.

Others have positioned GroupDAV as the leading protocol, citing CalDAV's excessive complexity as a source of interoperability bugs.

Their original blend of Irish traditional music, Celtic music, jazz, and classical chamber music inspired a generation of Irish musicians. They released seven albums on the Windham Hill label.  Origins  The origins of Nightnoise can be traced to the Bothy Band (disbanded in 1979), who made a name in Ireland and internationally with a lively fiddle-based sound that brought Irish music into the mainstream. One of the band's founders, guitarist Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, came from a long line of Irish musicians, and was considered one of the finest performers of traditional Irish music. In 1983, after seven years with the Bothy Band and several years collaborating with the master fiddler Kevin Burke, Ó Domhnaill began searching for a new project and a new sound. He met Billy Oskay in Portland, Oregon, and the two began a new collaboration focused on a new and innovative music that integrated Celtic, jazz, and classical chamber music. Billy Oskay was born in Kingston, New York, and had developed an international reputation as a violinist. He started playing violin at seven and went on to study under Eugen Prokop at the International Academy of Music Palma de Mallorca in Spain. He excelled equally in violin technique and composition. He graduated from the esteemed academy with a degree in violin and chamber music. Nightnoise began as a collaboration between this American violinist and Irish guitarist who sought to create a unique blend of musical forms. Together, they composed and recorded some songs in Oskay's Portland home and were pleased with the result – a unique understated sound that had a \\"rough but fresh quality that engendered a serene atmosphere.\\" Ó Domhnaill secured a contract with William Ackerman at Windham Hill Records, the tracks they recorded were mixed and released in 1984 under the title Nightnoise. The album represented a real departure from Ó Domhnaill's Bothy Band roots, and the mellow, ambient instrumental style incorporating jazz and classical elements and forms full of spirituality almost defined what would be called New Age music.  1987–1990  Three years later, Mícheál's sister, Irish pianist and vocalist Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill, who performed with her brother in Skara Brae, Relativity, and the Bothy Band, and Irish-American flutist Brian Dunning joined the original duo. Nightnoise, the band, was born. The quartet's first album Something of Time, was released by Windham Hill in 1987. It was followed by At the End of the Evening (1988), The Parting Tide (1990). This would be the last album to feature the playing and writing of Billy Oskay, who chose to follow his dream of owning his own recording studio, Big Red Studio.  1991–1997  Following Oskay's departure, Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham, a former member of Silly Wizard who had played with Tríona and Mícheál in the band Relativity, took over Oskay's duties. The band took on a much more Irish-centric sound, while still retaining their own signature style. The revamped Nightnoise went on to release the albums Shadow of Time (1994), A Different Shore (1995), and The White Horse Sessions (1997), an album featuring live concert performances mixed in with in-studio live performances, with their Windham Hill colleagues as their audience. The album also featured original material only available in this live format (the songs \\"Heartwood\\", \\"Do We\\", and \\"Murdo of the Moon\\"), as well as a cover of Van Morrison's classic \\"Moondance\\". This album marked the end of the band's contractual obligations to Windham Hill, and they decided to relocate to Ireland, going on hiatus while they each focused on their own projects. The White Horse Sessions proved to be the last Nightnoise album. Cunningham left the band following its release, and was replaced by Irish fiddler John Fitzpatrick. In a 1999 interview, Mícheál Ó Domhnaill stated that Nightnoise had not broken up, and that the band would be getting together again shortly. The band did indeed record new material (both original compositions and covers of classic songs), but they were all made for albums other than their own. Nightnoise officially disbanded towards the end of 2003. Johnny Cunningham died on 15 December 2003, from a heart attack. He was 46 years old. Mícheál Ó Domhnaill died from a fall in July 2006 at his home in Dublin, Ireland, at the age of 54.

McClintock served as co-chair of Hillary Clinton’s National Hispanic Leadership Council in 2008, he co-chaired her successful Puerto Rico primary campaign that year and served as the Thirteenth President of the Senate of Puerto Rico until December 31, 2008. He chaired Luis Fortuño’s Incoming Committee on Government Transition in 2008 and the Outgoing Committee on Government Transition in 2012, the only Puerto Rican to serve in both capacities. He was sworn into office as secretary of state on January 2, 2009, by Chief Justice Federico Hernández Denton, fulfilling the role of lieutenant governor (first-in-line of succession) in the island.  Early life  McClintock was born in London, on January 19, 1957. His father, George Davison McClintock (1925–2001), an Irish-American architect born in Texas City, Texas, was working for the United States Air Force at the time. McClintock's mother, Nívea Mercedes Hernández (1931–2000), born in Puerto Rico, was a university professor and a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Puerto Rico. Kenneth, along with his brother Steven George and sister Elaine Mercedes, were raised and educated in Puerto Rico. He graduated from University High School (UHS) in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, in 1974, where he served as student council president, studied from 1974 to 1977 at the UPRRP College of Business Administration, and in 1980 obtained his Juris Doctorate from Tulane University Law School. While in college, McClintock, along with Puerto Rico's former governor Luis Fortuño, founded the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, a student organization that promoted absentee voting in favor of the reelection of Governor Carlos Romero Barceló in 1980.PRSSA History McClintock never applied for admission to the bar, neither in Louisiana nor in Puerto Rico, as his intention was not to practice law but to be a public servant. He began that public service before law school, as the 19-year old staff director for the Puerto Rico House of Representatives Consumer Affairs Committee. He subsequently served as a legislative assistant to the New Party for Progress House delegation. McClintock has spent most of his adult life working in the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly, first as a full-time staffer and subsequently as a legislator, before serving as secretary of state and lieutenant governor. While in college, he was an Amway independent distributor, learning how to run a small private business and earning enough money to support himself. After retiring from government service, he joined Politank*, a government affairs firm as Senior Public Policy Advisor, until 2017 when Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz recruited him as his senior advisor. He was married in 1994, to Maria Elena Batista, who served from 2001 to 2013 as director of Sports and Recreation for the municipality of San Juan and a former 1988 Olympic swimmer. After separating on February 18, 2011, they divorced in 2012 after 18 years of marriage. The two have a son, Kevin Davison, born in 1995, a Georgetown University graduate, an aspiring actor, a past National President of the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, a post his father held in 1979-80, and current president of the Young Democrats of America (YDA) Hispanic Caucus, and a daughter, Stephanie Marie, born in 1997, and a University of Notre Dame junior. He lives in San Juan where he is an active member of the Puerto Rican Episcopal Church.  Political career  Early years = Involved in politics since the age of 13, at the age of 14, McClintock was appointed by President Richard Nixon as delegate to the White House Conference on Youth held from April 18–21, 1971. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the National Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In 1979 McClintock served as the first president of the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, which he cofounded with Luis Fortuño, then a Georgetown University undergrad. = 1980s = In 1984, the Jaycees honored him with the Outstanding Young Man of the Year in Journalism Award for his weekly columns in the now-defunct El Mundo daily newspaper. He was the executive director of the U.S. Democratic Party, chapter of Puerto Rico, from 1984 to 1988 and has attended all ten Democratic Party conventions since 1976 as a delegate, a superdelegate or as a staffer. A Democratic National Committeeman since 2000, he was reelected in 2016 to his fourth term, resigning the post in 2017 after 17 years of service. In 1988 he ran unsuccessfully as the New Progressive Party (NPP) candidate in House District 5. = 1990s = Kenneth McClintock He was a Municipal Councilman for San Juan from 1990 to 1992 and during his tenure was the author of the municipal ordinance that raised the salaries of Municipal Guards beyond $1,000 a month for the first time in Puerto Rican history. In 1992, he was elected the youngest Senator-at-Large for the 12th Legislature. In November 1996 he was the top vote getter among all NPP and PDP senatorial candidates. During his fourth term, he was nominated by his New Progressive Party caucus as Senate President on November 4, 2004, and formally elected and sworn in for a four- year term as the Senate's 13th President on January 10, 2005. In 1996, President Bill Clinton appointed McClintock as an at-large member of the Democratic Platform Committee, where he was a drafter of the platform plank on Puerto Rico. In the 1990s he fought for Puerto Rico's inclusion in the proposed World War II Memorial on the National Mall after only two territories (Hawaii and Alaska) had been included in the first memorial design and all other U.S. territories (Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands), several of which were actually invaded by Japan, had been excluded. His efforts included the approval of a Concurrent Resolution by the legislature and lobbying in Washington. During 1999, he served as the 62nd Chairman of the Council of State Governments, the youngest and first Hispanic in that organization's 75-year history. During his terms in CSG leadership, the organization strengthened its international ties, admitting several Canadian provinces as international member jurisdictions, co-sponsoring the foundation of the Parliamentary Conference of the Americas, and co-chairing with CSG President and Wisconsin's then-Governor Tommy Thompson a mission to the People's Republic of China, in which he met with Premier Zhū Róngjī. As chairman, McClintock increased the presence of Hispanics in CSG committees and task forces and helped organize CSG's best attended Annual Meeting ever, held in Quebec City, Canada. He also was part of the official delegation that attended the December 14, 1999, ceremonies commemorating the final turnover on December 31, 1999, of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian authorities. He authored over 1,200 legislative measures during his 16 years in the Senate, of which over 200 became law. He served as the second president of the Parliamentary Conference of the Americas from 1999 to 2000, a forum that brings together the parliamentary assemblies of the unitary, federal and federated states, regional parliaments and interparliamentary organizations of the Americas. The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico hosted the General Assembly of COPA in July 2000. He currently serves on the Governing Board of the Council of State Governments, and the board of directors of The Washington Center, a Washington, D.C.-based non- profit organization. = 2000s = In 2000, he was elected as Puerto Rico's Democratic National Committeeman, a position to which he was reelected in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016. Prior to his election as Senate President, he served as Senate Minority Leader from 2001 to 2004 and he chaired the Senate's Committee on Government and Federal Affairs, as well as the Joint Committee for the Córdova-Fernós Congressional Internships Program from 1993 to 2000. As Senate committee chairman, he produced reports that served to make radical changes in public policy. The report on the conditions of the companies availed to the tax benefits of the now-defunct Section 936 of the Federal Internal Revenue Code earned him an interview in ABC's Prime Time Live program and Univision Network. He has testified in diverse hearings of the Congressional Committees, and has been the guest speaker in several universities throughout the United States. He has been interviewed in ABC's Good Morning America, has debated on Fox News Network and has appeared on BBC news programs, as well as on C-SPAN's Washington Journal. His efforts to promote economic equality to Puerto Rico's consumers by stateside corporations were profiled in a Business Week article in 1998. In 1996, along with Fortuño, he was appointed by Governor Pedro Rosselló as co-chair of the NPP's Platform Committee, a position to which he was reappointed by the party's 2000 gubernatorial candidate Carlos I. Pesquera. In 2004, he chaired the New Progressive Party's Senate Campaign Committee and flipped his party's nine- member minority, of which he served as Minority Leader from 2001 to 2004, into a nearly two-thirds majority in the new Senate in 2005, even though the NPP gubernatorial candidate narrowly lost the election. In 2008, along with Roberto Prats, he co-chaired Sen. Clinton's successful campaign for Puerto Rico's presidential primary, which she won 68% to 32%, the second highest vote margin (after West Virginia) in that year's election cycle. In 2012, he was elected by the Puerto Rico Democratic State Convention to a fourth consecutive four-year term as the territory's Democratic National Committeeman, remaining the territory's most senior Democrat. In September 2009, he was elected to a four-year term as chairman of the DNC's Northeast Hispanic Caucus. In September 2012, he attended his tenth consecutive Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended his eleventh consecutive convention in Philadelphia in July, 2016 and has already been certified a super delegate to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.  Election as President of the Senate  Portrait of McClintock as President of the Senate by Cuban/Venezuelan artist Estrella Díaz From January 10, 2005, to December 31, 2008, McClintock presided over the Senate of Puerto Rico. His presidency was in jeopardy during most of that year, as former Governor Pedro Rosselló was sworn in as a member of the Senate on February 13, 2005, and sought the Presidency for the remainder of the term. McClintock was elected to the Puerto Rico Senate Presidency with 23 votes, including 14 of the 17 NPP senators (McClintock abstained, one seat was vacant and Sen. Norma Burgos abstained in protest for the manner in which the NPP caucus allegedly elected the Senate leadership), and the entire nine-member minority delegation of the Popular Democratic Party, while the Puerto Rico Independence Party senator followed party tradition in abstaining from leadership votes). Since 2001, Senate rules require a unanimous vote to change the presidency. During his Presidency, he backed many nominations and some public policy positions of Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. Some nominations failed to obtain the Senate's consent, two through rejection, others through inaction or withdrawal by the governor following the Senate president's \\"advice\\" to do so. He participated in the multilateral negotiations between the governor, the Speaker, McClintock, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Juan, the Episcopal bishop for the Diocese of Puerto Rico and several Protestant leaders, in breaking the logjam that led to the end of a two-week-long government shutdown in May 2006. For close to three years, of the seventeen senators that were elected under the NPP in the 2004 General Elections, six remained loyal to McClintock's presidency, thus denying his opponents the unanimity required by Senate Rules II and VI to declare the presidency vacant. As McClintock stripped eight of the ten senators who supported Rosselló's claim for the Presidency of the chairmanships of Senate committees, leaving a total of ten committees under the leadership of the five NPP senators who still backed him and two, the Ethics and the Public Safety committees remained under the leadership of senators supporting Rosselló. Many Capitol insiders had claimed that this had the effect of overflowing committees with work and slowing down the process of bills becoming laws. However, when that issue was raised on the floor of the Senate, McClintock ordered an investigation on legislative productivity that he stated statistically demonstrated that committee output was higher during the third legislative session (after committee and chairmanship consolidations) than during the first. One senator who supported him and came to the NPP expelled in the past term from the PDP, former Senate Majority Leader Jorge De Castro Font was expelled from the New Progressive Party for being McClintock's ally to remain Senate President. This sanction was endorsed in a Party state assembly in 2005, for allegedly insulting high officials of the NPP (including its president, Pedro Rosselló), rejecting to comply with majority decisions of the party's state assembly (including support for Rossello's Senate presidency bid), and allegedly making political alliances with the PDP delegation in the Senate. Senator McClintock and four of the other senators who supported him were relieved of party positions for the same reasons. The party's directorate recommended expelling Sen. McClintock as well as Senate Vice President Orlando Parga on February 13, 2006. On August 20, 2006, however, the party's General Assembly failed to ratify their expulsion, approving instead a generic censure, reportedly reflecting the discomfort that the proposed expulsion created among many party members. As a result of his refusal to yield his leadership position in the Senate, he was seen without any political future by those who supported Sen. Rossello's bid, including a number of NPP voters who also supported Rossello. On January 16, 2007, the NPP Senate Caucus imposed disciplinary sanctions on two more NPP senators, José Emilio González, Rosselló's fellow senator from the Arecibo district, and Carmelo Ríos Santiago of the Bayamón district. The two were the decisive votes to pass a Concurrent Resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would turn Puerto Rico's bicameral legislature in a unicameral system, an issue not addressed by the party's platform. In total, during the term, the caucus disciplined eight of the 16 members elected to the Senate in 2004. Members of the NPP hardcore rank and file had clearly stated they would never forgive the negotiations they allege took place against the statehood movement by McClintock, and did not acknowledge the Senate President's extensive efforts to lobby in Congress and generate national media coverage for the enactment of legislation to provide self-determination for Puerto Rico, as proposed by President George W. Bush's White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Political Status. Likewise, many political observers, including a number of NPP voters who opposed Rosselló, believed that McClintock's and Parga's removal from party membership rolls would be insignificant within the NPP; since both depended upon the rank and file structure to get elected with the party, while other observers and party leaders had expressed concern that the removals imperil future party victories, by the alienation of tens of thousands of past party supporters. Many party members, however, considered McClintock and his supporters as \\"traitors\\". On February 23, 2007, McClintock announced that if the party disciplinary sanctions were not lifted \\"within a reasonable time\\" he would file suit to protect \\"not only the constitutional rights of the senators who have been sanctioned but the rights of party members to freely select the candidates of their choice in the March 2008 primary\\". That \\"reasonable time\\" ended on March 29, 2007, when he, along with four other senators, filed suit in San Juan Superior Court, claiming that NPP leaders violated the due process required by the state elections laws when parties attempt to discipline its members. Judge Oscar Davila Suliveres ruled on April 12 against NPP Secretary Thomas Rivera Schatz and determined the lawsuit was meritorious and would be decided on the merits within several days. All sanctions against the McClintock Six were nullified by San Juan Superior Court Judge Oscar Dávila Suliveres on May 8, 2007, who determined that they had broken no programmatic or rule-based accord, and that they were free to run in the NPP's 2008 primary. On May 11, the Court reiterated, in a Nunc Pro Tunc Order, that any attempt by party officials to deny the rights of the McClintock Six would nullify the party primary. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling on June 12, 2007, declaring all sanctions against the senators null and void. On December 27, 2007, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico denied the NPP's attempt to deny McClintock's senatorial allies the opportunity to appear on the 2008 NPP primary ballot. In a 4–1 decision, the Court reaffirmed McClintock's right to remain as Senate President unless he voluntarily resigns, dies, or was removed as a member of the Senate. A 2007 El Nuevo Día opinion poll reflected that, in spite of being censured by the New Progressive Party, he had become its third most popular leader, after Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño and party president Pedro Rosselló, surpassing San Juan Mayor Jorge Santini, former gubernatorial candidate Carlos Pesquera and Bayamón Mayor Ramón Luis Rivera. There were several attempts to unify the New Progressive Party delegation in the Senate, but all of them were sabotaged by some Party leaders, such as then-Secretary General, Thomas Rivera Schatz and Party Vice-President Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer. Upon Luis Fortuño's decisive victory in the March 9, 2008, NPP primaries, McClintock and his (mostly renominated) stalwarts were welcomed back into the party, reinstated to their leadership positions and McClintock appointed five of the eleven former Senate defectors to committee chairmanships. On December 31, 2008, after a full term as Senate President, McClintock ended his 16-year career as a legislator, as he prepared to assume the duties of Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, for which he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, including many senators who had withdrawn their political support for him in the past.  Work as President of the Senate  Kenneth McClintock greets BG. Hector E. Pagan in the presence of (L – R) House Speaker Jose F. Aponte and MG Felix Santoni (Ret.) in the State Capitol on Memorial Day 2008 Ambassadors David Manning, then-British ambassador to the United States, visited his office, and met with People's Republic of China Premier Zhu Rongji in 1999, Costa Rica Presidents José María Figueres and Oscar Arias Sánchez, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Panama's President Martin Torrijos, well as U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He also championed improving school-level physical and health education, the theme of his World Health Day 2006 address before the Panamerican Health Organization in Washington, D.C.. McClintock was a frequent speaker at stateside universities, where he addressed Puerto Rico's political status issue. In September, 2007 he began a media campaign to oust Panama National Assembly president Pedro Miguel González Pinzón, who stands accused in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia of murdering Puerto Rican-born U.S. Army Sgt. Zak Hernández, bolstered by the approval by 25 of the 27 members of the Senate of Puerto Rico of a resolution he authored expressing the legislative body's \\"profound preoccupation with the Panamanian leader's election. González Pinzón was subsequently denied reelection. In 2007, McClintock convened a meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, of Senate presidents from Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands and Puerto Rico to establish the Outlying Areas Senate Presidents Caucus to discuss issues common to the nation's outlying areas and devise common strategies to deal with such issues. One outcome of his efforts was Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin's support of the XM/Sirius satellite radio merger after Sirius committed to extending service to Puerto Rico. On April 7, 2008, McClintock and House Speaker Aponte joined former President Bill Clinton for the unveiling of a statue depicting former President Franklin D. Roosevelt (one of only two in a wheelchair), now a part of the \\"Paseo de los Presidentes\\", or President's Walk, exhibiting on the south side of the Capitol statues of the nine presidents who have visited the U.S. territory while in office.. On May 26, McClintock presided over the yearly Memorial Day ceremony and concert, including a keynote address by then- Sen. Clinton in the presence of her husband and daughter. At the end of the ceremony, the names of several men and women were unveiled on Puerto Rico's Memorial Wall, which honors Puerto Ricans who lost their life in military service. McClintock's presidency began to draw to a close when on June 30, 2008, he gaveled the Senate out of the seventh and last regular session of the term. He remained as president until December 31, 2008, a day after he called the Senate into a final special session, when he turned over the gavel to Senate Secretary Manuel A. Torrres, who served as Acting President until the fourteenth Senate President, Thomas Rivera Schatz was officially elected on January 12, 2009. On September 11, 2008, McClintock presided over the first joint meeting of the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly outside the Capitol ever, held at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to commemorate the 7th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the United States and present the Military Medal of the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly to those residents of Puerto Rico who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 1,000 of the 9,000 eligible were present for the ceremony, accompanied by over 1,500 family members. Puerto Rico Independence Party legislators boycotted the event.  2008 transition  On November 7, 2008, the NPP's senators-elect chose Rivera Schatz to succeed McClintock as of January 12, 2009, as the Fourteenth President of the Senate in its 91-year history. McClintock was appointed by Governor-Elect Luis Fortuño, to serve as chairman of the Incoming Committee on Government Transition. During the first twelve days of the new year, outgoing Senate Secretary Manuel A. Torres served as Acting President of the legislative body.  Secretary of State of Puerto Rico  Kenneth D. McClintock and his staffers at the Puerto Rico State Department Building in San Juan. On November 11, 2008, Governor-Elect Luis Fortuño appointed McClintock as Secretary of State of Puerto Rico. Due to the fact that the appointment entailed serving the role of lieutenant governor, McClintock required confirmation by both the Senate of Puerto Rico as well as the House of Representatives. McClintock was active in the National Lieutenant Governors Association (NLGA) and the National Association of Secretaries of State. McClintock was sworn in, under a recess appointment, as the 22nd Secretary of State of Puerto Rico on the morning of January 2, 2009 by Puerto Rico Supreme Court Chief Justice Federico Hernández Denton in the court's chambers minutes after he privately swore in Gov. Fortuño, who later took the oath of office in a public ceremony that afternoon. On January 15, 2009, he was confirmed unanimously by the Senate of Puerto Rico and with only two votes in opposition in the 53-seat Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Having been confirmed, he was sworn in on January 17, 2009, by Bayamón Superior Court Judge Angel Manuel Candelas in a private ceremony in the neighborhood where McClintock was raised and lived for many years. In September 2009, he led Puerto Rico's four-member component of the United States' delegation, headed by United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke to the III Americas Competitiveness Forum in Santiago, Chile, participated in 2010 in the fourth Forum, held in Atlanta and in the fifth Forum in Santo Domingo in 2011. McClintock was designated by Fortuño to lead the Puerto Rico governments efforts to facilitate the islands' transition to digital television. He has also been designated as chairman of the government's efforts to assist in the 2010 census, as well as the five-member Executive Branch Reorganization and Modernization Committee that produced 13 reorganization plans, eleven of which became law. He also chaired a five- member Legislative Reform Committee that made recommendations in October 2009 regarding a revamping of Puerto Rico's legislature. In 2010, Gov. Fortuño delegated him all gubernatorial powers regarding the approval of public- private partnership (P3) contracts under Puerto Rico's Public Private Partnership Law. Domestically, McClintock frequently participates as a speaker at activities throughout the states, Puerto Rico and foreign countries. In 2009, he spoke before the National Puerto Rican Coalition in Washington, D.C., served as the commencement speaker at the Universidad del Este (UNE) in Puerto Rico and joined Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Timothy Murray at a recognition ceremony of the 65th Infantry Regiment in Worcester, Massachusetts, on June 20. In 2011, he was the keynote speaker at Hispanic Heritage activities in Cleveland, Ohio While Secretary of State, McClintock met Republic of China President Ma Ying-jeou. On January 12, 2010, as acting governor, McClintock was placed in charge of Puerto Rico's Haitian relief efforts by Governor Fortuño, which included a $4.5 million Telethon benefitting the Red Cross and collecting millions of pounds of aid, reportedly the largest shipment of non-governmental aid sent during the first two weeks of the relief effort. On January 20, McClintock made a 4-hour visit to Port- au-Prince, Haiti, where, along with Puerto Rico journalist Carmen Jovet, he met with President Préval and Prime Minister Bellerive to coordinate Puerto Rico's relief efforts. He subsequently met with Preval in San Juan and was appointed by Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the United States delegation to a meeting in Martinique in March 2010 to plan the multi-nation redevelopment of Haiti. He also helped coordinate Puerto Rico's initial response to the massive February 27, 2010, earthquake in Chile. In September 2010, he headed the Puerto Rico delegation to the International Book Fair (LIBER 2010), dedicated to Puerto Rico and held in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to his other duties, he participated in organizing President Obama's June 14, 2011, historic visit to Puerto Rico. In July, 2011, he was selected as co-chair of the National Association of Secretaries of State's International Relations Committee at its 2011 summer meeting in Daniels, West Virginia. McClintock subsequently hosted NASS' 2012 summer meeting in San Juan. In the summer of 2011, along with United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brenda Sprague, he announced that Secretary of State Clinton has authorized the opening in 2012 of a U.S. Department of State Passport Office in San Juan, to serve Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, the first such office in the Caribbean ever. Due to the temporary closure of the Roberto Sánchez Vilella Government Center's North Tower by the EPA in 2012, the ribbon-cutting ceremony was pushed back beyond McClintock's incumbency as secretary of state. Until 1985, the federal agency authorized the Puerto Rico State Department to issue United States passports, but since then had only allowed it to operate a passport acceptance agency. =Foreign travel as Secretary of State= Secretary McClintock visited eleven countries, including being a member of United States delegations, traveling to coordinate disaster relief, represent Gov. Fortuño or promote foreign trade and the Caribbean Energy Grid proposal. Reflecting McClintock's international activities, the countries in three continents visited include: *Bahamas *Barbados *Canada *Chile *People's Republic of China *Dominican Republic *Grand Cayman *Haiti *Martinique *Spain *Taiwan =Meetings with major religious leaders= During his term as secretary of state and previously during his service in the Senate, McClintock met with numerous religious leaders, including the Papal Nuncio in the Dominican Republic, who has ecclesiastical authority over the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori and the chief abbot of the Buddhist Shaolin Temple in Henan, Shi Yongxin. =Other international activities= Prior to serving as secretary of state, his official foreign travels in four continents, which set the stage for his level of international activity, included: *Austria *Belgium *Brazil *Canada *Costa Rica *Guatemala *Mexico *Panama *People's Republic of China *Spain *Turkey *United Kingdom On July 1, 2000, McClintock led COPA's Mission of Electoral Observers during Mexico's presidential elections which the nation's ruling party for decades lost to Vicente Fox, who became President of Mexico later that year.

Caribbean Energy Grid During his term as secretary of state, McClintock promoted the Fortuño administration's proposal to develop a Caribbean Energy Grid in which all Caribbean and Central American islands and nations would interconnect via an underwater electric transmission cable in order to generate electric cost reductions to consumers throughout the region, contribute to renewable energy development and reduced dependence on oil, the fuel most used to generate electricity in Caribbean islands today. On December 1, 2009, McClintock first spoke of the Fortuño administration proposal, during the 33rd Miami Conference on the Caribbean & Central America, that a Caribbean Basin electric grid be developed to reduce the region's \\"addiction to oil\\", as he called it. By April 2010, Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Secretary of State Clinton were speaking positively and publicly about the Caribbean Energy Grid proposal at an energy ministerial meeting of the Americas held in Washington, D.C.. McClintock has spoken extensively about this Fortuño administration proposal at numerous conferences, including some specifically organized to discuss the proposed grid, since he first proposed it in December 2009. The first concrete steps in developing the proposal announced by McClintock in December 2009 are already being taken. In 2010, the United States Congress approved a $475,000 earmark supported by Reps. Donna Christensen (D-VI) and Pedro Pierluisi (D-PR) to fund a study on the viability of interconnecting Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands power systems. Siemens AG completed the study in July 2011. The government of Spain financed a World Bank pre-feasibility study on the possible interconnection of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic's power systems, which would be an integral part of the proposed Caribbean Energy Grid. Final days as Secretary of State After the election of Sen. Alejandro García Padilla as the 10th elected Governor of Puerto Rico on November 6, 2012, McClintock became the statutory chairman of Governor Fortuño's Outgoing Committee on Government Transition, the first and so far only to have chaired both the Incoming and Outgoing Committee on Transition since the approval of the Government Transition Law of 2004. On January 2, 2013, following long-standing tradition, he opened the Governor-elect's Inaugural Ceremony, minutes before completing this last stage of his public service career. Having served a full four-year term, McClintock tied with Secretary Fernando Chardón as the third longest-serving Secretary of State. Only Secretaries Sánchez-Vilella and Burgos served longer terms. Post-governmental life After a public career that spanned 39 years, McClintock accepted a full pension from the Government Retirement System in June 2013. He was recruited by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico to teach American Government and Government Management courses and a Legislative Procedure seminar at its Metro campus in San Juan. He worked for Politank*, a Puerto Rico-based bipartisan government affairs firm from 2013 to 2017 as its Senior Public Policy Advisor and was frequently asked to speak at legislative hearings, public ceremonies or in the media. From January 2017 to April 2018, he served as the senior advisor to Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz before returning to the private sector. Directorships For nearly two decades, McClintock has been a member of the board of directors of The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars (TWC), a Washington, DC-based non-profit.

Wilfrido Ramos-Orench as provisional bishop of the Puerto Rico Diocese. Legacies Among the long-lasting legacies of McClintock's public life are the Córdova-Fernós Congressional Internship Program, which has been replicated in 19 states and territories, the most recent being the United States Virgin Islands, where Gov. John deJongh signed a bill establishing a similar program after McClintock testified in favor of passage in the V.I. Legislature. Some of the more significant laws authored by McClintock during his 16-year senatorial career include: • The Córdova-Fernós Congressional Internship Act of 1993 • Puerto Rico's 911 Act of 1993 • The Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music Act • The 1996 Puerto Rico Casino Act • Net-Metering Act • Puerto Rico's Light-Pollution Control Act On June 12, 2015, acting Governor David Bernier hosted the unveiling of McClintock's official portrait at the State Department in the presence of former Governor Fortuño. Publications During the 1980s, McClintock was a regular columnist for the now-defunct El Mundo newspaper, and has published over 100 essays and speeches in his Facebook page. He is known to continue historical research activities which he has publicly said may result in future books and publications.

During the period of 1975 to 1979, when Cambodia was ruled by the government of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge party, approximately 1.7 million Cambodians were killed through the combined result of political executions, starvation, and forced labor (see Khmer Rouge period (1975–1979). In 1976, Dahl participated in a debate in Sveriges Radio about the situation in Cambodia, where she said among other things: Dahl reiterated these views in an article in the journal Vietnam Nu (published by the Swedish Committee for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) in 1977. In 1997, Per Ahlmark's book An Open Sore () was published. In the book, Ahlmark among other things questioned Dahl's appropriateness as Speaker of the Parliament due to her past statements about the Khmer Rouge regime. In the debate that ensued, Dahl made a public apology in Dagens Nyheter in which she wrote: During a debate hosted by ABF in Stockholm in 2005 about the revolutions in Cambodia and Vietnam, Dahl said, according to the author Peter Fröberg Idling: \\"The claim that we supported Pol Pot is a lie\\".  Personal life  Birgitta Dahl was married to Enn Kokk until his death. She has three children. One of her daughters, Anna Kettner, is also a former Social Democratic politician.

It is one of only three surviving drainage engines in East Anglia, and is a Grade II* listed building. History During the seventeenth century, large areas of fenland in East Anglia were reclaimed via extensive draining schemes. Despite this, crops and livestock were frequently swept away by widescale flooding as the land sank because of the drainage. As a partial solution, windpumps were used to pump water away from flood-affected areas, but relied on the weather and lacked the power required to lift large quantities of water. Wicken Fen nature reserve has a preserved and restored windpump which is used to manage the water table in the Fen. The advent of steam power in the late 18th century offered a new solution, and these new engines began to spring up around The Fens. Steam engine Scoop wheel of the Stretham Old Engine The steam engine on the Old West River (Great Ouse) just south of Stretham was built by the Derbyshire firm, Butterleys, in 1831, costing £4950. It replaced four nearby windmills and its scoop wheel was used successfully for over a century to lift water from flood channels back into the river. Powered by coal that was brought by barge, it consumed a ton of fuel every four hours. The rotative beam engine is of the double-acting type with a beam of and a flywheel in diameter. The scoop wheel it drives has been successively enlarged as the level of the fens has shrunk: the first wheel was , increased to in 1850 and to in 1896 and lifted 120-150 tons of water per minute. During use, the engine needed constant supervision, with the stoker and superintendent on 24-hour call. One superintendent even installed a telescope in his window so he could supervise the workmen without the need to get his feet wet. Replacement In 1924, the installation of a Mirrlees diesel engine saw the steam engine relegated to 'standby', and the last serious use was during the floods of 1939 and 1940. Prickwillow Museum contains a nearly identical Mirrlees Diesel engine that has been preserved and restored to working order. The pumping station was later replaced with 5 smaller, more efficient, electrical pumps that drain into the River Cam and are still in use. Public opening The engine is open to the public Sunday afternoons and Bank Holidays from the beginning of April to the end of October between 1.00pm and 5.00pm.

Schor (born 1955) is an economist and Sociology Professor at Boston College. She has studied trends in working time, consumerism, the relationship between work and family, women's issues and economic inequality, and concerns about climate change in the environment. From 2010 to 2017, she studied the sharing economy under a large research project funded by the MacArthur Foundation. She is currently working on a project titled \\"The Algorithmic Workplace\\" with a grant from the National Science Foundation. Academic career Education = Schor earned a B.A. in Economics magna cum laude from Wesleyan University in 1975 and a Ph.D in economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1982. Her dissertation is titled \\"Changes in the Cyclical Variability of Wages: Evidence from Nine Countries, 1955-1980.\\" = Teaching = Juliet Schor taught at numerous institutions around the country. Namely, she was an assistant professor of Economics at Williams College and Columbia University. In 1984, she joined the Department of Economics at Harvard University and throughout her 17 years teaching there, she rose from assistant professor to eventually a senior lecturer in the Department of Economics and the Committee on Degrees in Women's Studies. In 2014-15, she was the Matina S. Horner Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard. Currently, she is a Professor of Sociology at Boston College. She joined in 2001 and was department chair from 2005-2008 and director of graduate studies from 2001-2013. = Board Memberships = In 1977, Schor was one of several founders and editors of South End Press. Additionally, in 1978 she was a founding member of the Center for Popular Economics. Currently, Schor is Chair of the Board of Directors of Better Future Project, and she is on the advisory board of the Center for a New American Dream.

From 1995 to 1996, Schor served as a Fellow of the John Simmon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. From 2014 to 2015, she held an Advanced Study Fellowship with the Radcliffe Institute. As of 2020, Schor is an Associate Fellow at the Tellus Institute. Personal life Juliet was born on November 9, 1955. Schor grew up in California, Pennsylvania where her father developed the first specialty health clinic for miners in a small Pennsylvania mining town. As she grew up she gained a stronger sense of class difference and labor exploitation. She also found herself reading Marx at a young age. Her husband, Prasannan Parthasarathi, is also a professor at Boston College. Academic Work Early Thought = While obtaining her Ph.D in economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Schor began to explore the relationship between how employers controlled and regulated employees. Her and her advisor, Sam Bowles, called these variable of conditions “the cost of job loss” which included how long a person can expect to be unemployed and what kind of social welfare benefits they are eligible for as an unemployed individual. While a professor at Harvard, Schor was interested in another determinant of “the cost of job loss,” which was the number of hours worked by the employee. By analyzing various data, she found that even though an employee works overtime, they seem to have no money saved at the end. This led to her question “What do workers do with the money they earn and why is it so hard for them to save money” which required the investigation of social pressures on spending and consumer culture. In an interview discussing her book Plentitude: The New Economics of True Wealth she says, \\"When people work too many hours they tend to feel deprived and they use consumption to reward themselves, whether that be for an expensive vacation, kitchen remodel or a bigger diamond. The downturn has actually opened up space for people to think about different trajectories for their consumption expectations over their lifetimes.” In addition, at an early age, Schor strived to make her work accessible to all. In an interview with Peter Shea, she talks about her early intellectual formation, her critique of conventional economics, and her decision to write for an audience that includes the general public as well as her colleagues in the academy. = Best-Seller Books =The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure, Basic Books (1992)  By using household survey data on hours of paid work and one’s time use, Schor discovered that average time spent at work increased around 1 month per year between the years of 1969 and 1987. Further, in the book, Schor discuss a model she developed to predict hours of unpaid work in the home. The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don’t Need (1999)  In this book, Schor explores the social and cultural processes that drive individuals to spending and eventually debt. She analyzes that consumers are spending more than they did in the past. As a result, she observes that saving rates have been on a decline. Schor argues that one of the reasons for this change over time is our view in the “keeping up” process of spending which has led to overspending. Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture (2005)  Many companies have targeted marketing products towards children and in turn, have made them into “commercialized children.” Schor looks at how advertising strategies convince kids that products are necessary to their social survival and this is adopted into their mindsets for their future as well. Schor also provides a sort of optimism at the end, advising parents and teachers on how to deal with this problem.  Plentitude: The New Economics of True Wealth (2010)  In this work, Schor outlines a roadmap to move beyond consumerism and consumerism's inherent link to ecological decline. She favors a well-balanced approach to living, considering such elements as nature, community, intelligence, and time. Schor narrated a short film on the economic organization discussed in her book for an animation by Films for Action.  After the Gig (2020)  In After the Gig, Schor explores the gig economy, e.g. Uber, Airbnb, etc., and effects of such organizations on worker exploitation, carbon emissions, and racial discrimination. Looking at data extracted from thirteen cases, Schor comes to offer a better means for creating a shared and equitable economy.

He hosts The Howie Carr Show recorded at WRKO in Boston and broadcast on weekdays, in addition to writing three columns a week for the Boston Herald. He is also an award-winning news reporter. CareerBroadcasting= Howie Carr and co-executive producer Grace CurleyHowie Carr has hosted a syndicated weekday radio talk-show on more than twenty-five New England radio stations including Boston's WRKO (AM 680). The show, titled The Howie Carr Show, is syndicated to stations throughout northern and central New England and can be heard elsewhere via live streaming on HowieCarrShow.com. In November 2014, Carr left syndicator Entercom Communications and formed his own Howie Carr Radio Network. Video sample of a live broadcast on from Howie Carr's Needham, MA studio. WRKO had announced it would not carry the show but on March 9, 2015 it became an affiliate as of March 16, 2015. In August 2016, The Howie Carr Show began syndicating one hour of the show on the Newsmax cable television channel. Carr has filled in for several nationally-syndicated talk show hosts, including Mark Levin and Dennis Miller. He has also worked as a reporter and commentator for Boston television stations WGBH-TV and WLVI. =Literature= As a journalist  Carr began his career as a reporter for the Winston-Salem Journal, before returning to New England in 1979 as assistant city editor for the Boston Herald American (now the Boston Herald). From 1980 to 1981, he was the Boston City Hall bureau chief of the Herald American, and he later worked as the paper's State House bureau chief. As a political reporter for WNEV (now WHDH) in 1982, his coverage of then-mayor Kevin White was so relentless that after the mayor announced he was not running again, he told The Boston Globe that one of the things he enjoyed most about his impending retirement was not having Carr chase him around the city. In 1985, Carr won the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism. In television, he has been nominated for an Emmy Award. For years Carr has criticized former Boston Globe and Herald guest columnist Mike Barnicle. In 1998, Barnicle resigned from the Boston Globe over allegations of plagiarism and fabrication of stories. A Boston Globe column by Steve Bailey stated that Carr gave out Barnicle's home phone number, an allegation Carr denies. Barnicle called Carr \\"a pathetic figure\\", and asked \\"Can you imagine being as consumed with envy and jealousy toward me for as long as it has consumed him?\\" In 1998, Don Imus claimed Carr's wife was having an affair with boxer Riddick Bowe. Mrs. Carr retained Alan Dershowitz as her lawyer. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement. In a 2007 column, Carr alleged that Imus' statements were incited by Barnicle. According to Carr, Barnicle told Imus that Carr had said Imus \\"would die before his kid got out of high school\\". In 2002, the Boston Herald and Carr were the subjects of a lawsuit by Superior Court Judge Ernest Murphy. The newspaper reported that Murphy had said of a fourteen-year- old rape victim: \\"She can't go through life as a victim. She's 14. She got raped. Tell her to get over it.\\" He was also alleged to have said of a 79-year-old robbery victim: \\"I don't care if she's 109.\\" Carr, in a front-page column on February 20, 2002, criticized Murphy for handing down lenient sentences in bail decisions in rape cases and included references to his daughters, wondering what Murphy would do if it was one of his offspring that had been the victim. Murphy denied all of the allegations and claimed the newspaper libeled him, ruining his physical and emotional health and damaging his career and reputation as a good man. Ultimately, Murphy won the suit and was awarded a $2.09 million payment. During the trial, when asked what his reaction was to the Carr column, Murphy had said he \\"wanted to kill him\\". As a book author Carr's book Kennedy Babylon, was released on March 21, 2017. Carr has written non-fiction books about gangsters and also two fiction books, Hard Knocks and Killers. =Non-fiction= ;Winter Hill Gang series In early 2006, Carr became a book author with the publication of the New York Times-rated best-seller The Brothers Bulger, about brothers Billy and Whitey Bulger. Whitey was the third boss of the Winter Hill Gang. Carr's second book, Hitman, was released in April 2011, two months before Whitey Bulger (then under the name Charlie Gasko) was arrested after sixteen years on the run. About Johnny Martorano, Hitman was also rated a best-seller by The New York Times. In 2013, Rifleman: The Untold Story of Stevie Flemmi was published. It was followed a year later by Ratman: The Trial and Conviction of Whitey Bulger. Billy Bulger's power as President of the Massachusetts Senate intrigued Carr. He began to research both the politician and his gangster brother. Indeed, Carr's arrival on Madison Street in Somerville, Massachusetts, in the late 1970s meant he was perfectly placed to do just that,The Brothers Bulger for Somerville's Marshall Motors garage (at 12 Marshall Street; now a church) was an early base of the Winter Hill Gang. In 1978, the second leader of the Winter Hill Gang, Howie Winter, who lived one street away from Carr, on Montrose Street, was jailed on federal \\"horse race fixing\\" charges. Bulger succeeded him, and remained the boss until 1995, the year after he fled Boston due to a pending federal indictment. Whitey was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list from 1999 until his arrest in Santa Monica, California, on June 22, 2011. He had a $2 million bounty on his head. Kevin Weeks replaced Bulger but was arrested and imprisoned in 2000. He was released in 2005 after having served as a cooperating witness for the FBI. While Carr believes Whitey Bulger wanted him dead (\\"his greatest regret is not killing me\\"), due to his finger-pointing at Billy Bulger, he disputes Kevin Weeks' claim that they were close to killing him by either blowing him up with explosives placed inside a basketball, or by shooting him from a cemetery across the street from Carr's former home at 91 Concord Road in Acton, Massachusetts. Whitey and Weeks had knowledge of Carr's residence because Carr was a neighbor of one of Weeks' brothers. Whitey knew what Carr looked like, from Carr's job on television. \\"Plus, I was in his neighborhood every day. But I never ventured into Whitey's package store.\\" The store in question was South Boston Liquor Mart (also known as Stippos; now Rotary Liquors), at 295 Old Colony Avenue, which Whitey had extorted from its legitimate owner. Carr began taking whatever precautions he could to keep Whitey and Weeks off his tail. \\"The key to staying alive, I quickly figured out, was to avoid becoming a creature of habit. Wiseguys (or anyone else) who don't mix up their routines are the ones who inevitably get caught 'flat-footed,' to use the old expression. I drove home a different way every evening. If possible, when I parked, I backed into the space so that, if I had to, I could flee more quickly. I stopped meeting face-to-face with anyone I didn't know. I stayed out of bars, especially in Southie. Occasionally I'd sleep somewhere other than my house. The local cops kept an eye on my house in the pre-dawn hours. Slowly the noose began to tighten around Whitey's neck and I relaxed somewhat. Whitey vanished in late 1994, but Weeks was still lurking about. At a tanning salon, he bragged to a Herald photographer that he knew that I had lived next to a graveyard. He mentioned nothing about any C-4 or high-powered rifles, but when he was arrested in 1999 his indirect threats against me were included in a DEA detention warrant.\\" \\"I was always looking over my shoulder,\\" Carr explained four years after Whitey's arrest. \\"The day he went missing, I was driving down the street, and on the radio, they said he had disappeared. For the first time in ten years, I didn't have to look over my shoulder.\\" =Fiction= In 2012, Carr moved into fictional writing with his third book, Hard Knocks, which was followed three years later by Killers, his sixth and most recent release. =Relationship with Donald Trump= During the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, Carr hosted rallies and he had lunch with the candidate on his private jet. Carr had candidate Trump on his radio show more than a dozen times, including election night. In 2017, Carr and his wife Kathy joined as member of the Mar-a-Lago Club, a resort and hotel for dues-paying members. On June 29, 2016, Carr, as an opening speaker at a Bangor, Maine, rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, made a Native American \\"war whoop\\" when referring to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Early life  Son of René Joseph Bouvet de Précourt, a captain in the service of the French East India Company and of the French Royal Navy under Suffren, François Joseph Bouvet went to sea at the age of twelve with his father aboard the Villevault in 1765. In 1780, Bouvet served in the East Indies in the famous campaign of 1781–83 under the command of Suffren. He was promoted to lieutenant (Lieutenant de vaisseau) in 1785.  Naval career  On the outbreak of the French Revolution he very naturally took a Republican stance. In 1790, he became second officer aboard the Prudence. In 1790, he was promoted captain (capitaine de vaisseau) and received the command of the Audacieux (80) in the first great fleet collected by the Republic. In the same year (1793) he was promoted to rear-admiral, and command the Second Squadron of the fleet in Brest, which fought the Battle of the First of June (1794) against Lord Howe. Until the close of 1796 he continued in command of a squadron in the French Channel fleet. In the December of that year he was entrusted with the van division of the fleet which was sent from Brest to attempt to land General Hoche with an expeditionary force in the south of Ireland. The stormy weather scattered the French as soon as they left Brest. Bouvet, who found himself at daybreak on 17 December separated with nine sail of the line from the rest of the fleet, opened his secret orders, and found that he was to make his way to Mizen Head. He took a wide course to avoid meeting British cruisers, and on the 19th fell in with a considerable part of the rest of the fleet and some of the transports. On 21 December he arrived off Dursey Island at the entry to Bantry Bay. On 24 December he anchored near Bere Island with part of his fleet. The continued storms which blew down Bantry Bay made it impossible to land the troops he had with him. On the evening of 25 December the storm increased to such a pitch of violence that the frigate Immortalité in which Bouvet had hoisted his flag was blown out to sea. The wind moderated by 29 December, but Bouvet, being convinced that none of the ships of his squadron could have remained at the anchorage, steered for Brest, where he arrived on 1 January 1797. His fortune had been very much that of his colleagues in this storm-tossed expedition, and on the whole he had shown more energy than most of them. He was wrong, however, in thinking that all his squadron had failed to keep their anchorage in Bantry Bay. The government, displeased by his precipitate return to Brest, dismissed him from command soon afterwards. He was compelled to open a school to support himself. Napoleon restored him to the service, and he commanded the 2-ships of the line and 4-frigates squadron sent to occupy Guadeloupe during the peace of Amiens, hoisting his flag on the Redoutable. In 1803, he was promoted to military chief of Brest harbour, and later préfet maritime of Brest, in 1813. In December 1813, distrusted by Napoleon, he was replaced by Cosmao-Kerjulien. At the Restoration, he was made a baron by Louis XVIII, in July 1814. Promoted to vice-admiral in 1816, he was préfet maritime of Lorient, and left active service in November 1817. He died in 1832.

He was great-grandson of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache, the great-great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, and a nephew of George Mifflin Dallas the 11th Vice President of the United States who served under James K. Polk. =Early career= Wainwright was appointed to the US Naval Academy in 1864 by President Abraham Lincoln and graduated near the top of his class in 1868. Wainwright's early career is not well documented. From 1890 to 1893 he commanded the , and in 1896 he became the Chief Intelligence Officer of the Navy. In November 1897, he was ordered to the Armored Cruiser , to serve as executive officer under Captain Charles D. Sigsbee. Spanish–American War On the night the Maine was blown up in Havana harbor, Wainwright stood beside Sigsbee on the quarterdeck as the vessel was sinking. It was Wainwright who issued the order to lower the lifeboats in which the surviving crew escaped. From the beginning, Wainwright believed the Maine was not blown up by accident and he was impatient to avenge the death of the officers, bluejackets and Marines who died as a result. In the interval between the blowing up of the Maine and the declaration of war against Spain, Wainwright was assigned command of the tender and placed in charge of the salvage survey and recovery of the bodies of the victims. He stayed aboard throughout the seven weeks long Sampson court of inquiry, never setting foot ashore. As the initial salvage closed, for concern about oncoming war, Wainwright remained. On the day that the last salvage team was ordered home, the Spanish naval commander in Havana, Admiral Vincente Manterola, ordered the American flag, which was still flying from the rigging of the wrecked Maine, struck. Wainwright heard of the order and, calling an interpreter, issued an order that immediately made him famous, When Wainwright did finally leave Havana, he hauled down the flag himself. On his arrival in Washington, the U. S. Navy was in the process of purchasing vessels that could be used in the war. Among them was a yacht, the Corsair, owned by J. P. Morgan. She was converted into a gunboat, renamed the , and commissioned with Wainwright in command. In the Battle of Santiago de Cuba he engaged the Spanish torpedo boats Furor and Plutón, driving them ashore as wrecks with her battery of 6-pounders. The victory came with no casualties, which was attributed to \\"The accuracy and rapidity of her fire, making the proper service of the guns on the Spanish ships impossible.\\" Wainwright was commended for his valor in this action and was advanced by ten numbers on the promotion seniority list. After ordering his heavily damaged flagship Infanta Maria Teresa to run aground, Spanish fleet commander Spanish Admiral Cervera, was picked up by the Gloucester. Wainwright was there to greet him as he was brought aboard. \\"I congratulate you, sir,\\" said the American, \\"on having made as gallant a fight as was ever seen on the sea.\\" 1900-1911 From 1900–1902, Wainwright was Superintendent of United States Naval Academy. During this time, the submarine boat was in Annapolis to train crews for submarines then under construction. Wainwright, having this opportunity to observe their operation, fully endorsed them for their planned harbor defense role. In 1904 he commanded American forces during the Santo Domingo Affair in which his ships shelled rebel troops and supported an amphibious assault. Later, promoted to rear admiral, he commanded the Second Division of the Great White Fleet during that fleet's historic voyage around the world from 1907-1909. Wainwright was invested as a Chevalier (knight) of the French Legion of Honor. Retired from active duty on December 7, 1911. Admiral Wainwright died on March 6, 1926 in Washington, D.C. and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. =Marriage and family= He married Evelyn Wotherspoon on September 11, 1873 in Washington, D.C.. Their son, Commander Richard Wainwright, Jr., United States Navy, earned the Medal of Honor for his service at Veracruz, Mexico. A Naval Academy classmate, Admiral Seaton Schroeder, became his brother-in-law when he married Wainwright's sister, Maria Campbell Bache Wainwright.

Thomas Edward Bowdich (20 June 1791 – 10 January 1824) was an English traveller and author. Life Bowdich was born at Bristol and educated at Bristol Grammar School. In 1813, he married Sarah Wallis, who shared his subsequent career. In 1814, through his uncle, J. Hope-Smith, governor of the British Gold Coast settlements, he obtained a writership in the service of the African Company of Merchants and was sent to Cape Coast. In 1817, he was sent, with two companions, William Hutchison and Henry Tedlie, to Kumasi on a mission to the king of Ashanti, and chiefly through his skillful diplomacy the mission succeeded in its object of securing British control over the coast natives. In 1818, Bowdich returned to England, and in 1819 published an account of his mission and of the study he had made of the court of Kumasi, entitled Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee, &c.; (London, 1819). He later presented his Ashanti collections to the British Museum.British Museum Collection Bowdich publicly attacked the management of the African committee, and his strictures were instrumental in leading the British government to assume direct control over the Gold Coast. From 1820 to 1822, Bowdich lived in Paris, studying mathematics and the natural sciences, and was on intimate terms with Georges Cuvier, Alexander von Humboldt and other savants. During his stay in France he edited several works on Africa, and also wrote scientific works. In 1822, accompanied by his wife, he went to Lisbon, where, from a study of historic MSS., he published An Account of the Discoveries of the Portuguese in . . . Angola and Mozambique (London, 1824). In 1823, Bowdich and his wife, after some months spent in Madeira and Cape Verde Islands, arrived at Bathurst (now Banjul) at the mouth of the Gambia, intending to go to Sierra Leone and thence explore the interior. However, Bowdich died from malaria while in Bathurst on 10 January 1824, leaving his widow Sarah with three children. His widow, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich Lee, published an account of his last journey, entitled Excursions in Madeira and Porto Santo . . . to which is added A Narrative of the Continuance of the Voyage to its Completion, &c; (London, 1825).

She was a granddaughter of financier Jacob Schiff. Schiff was interested in social services and reform, and was involved in several welfare groups. Early life Schiff was born in New York City into a prominent German Jewish banking family, the daughter of Mortimer Schiff and Adele (Neustadt) Schiff, and the granddaughter of financier Jacob Schiff. She attended secondary school at Manhattan's Brearley School and attended Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Afterward, she began living as a wealthy debutante. Marriages, The New York Post Schiff's first marriage came in 1923, in spite of strong resistance by her parents, to Richard B. W. Hall, a broker. In the 1930s when she married George Backer, a city councillor and a staunch liberal Democrat, Schiff's political stance changed and she became a strong supporter of the Democratic party and the New Deal. She was interested in social services and reform, and was involved in several welfare groups, chief among them the Henry Street Settlement. She lived in New York City and had a countryhouse in Bernardsville, New Jersey. In 1939, Schiff bought control of the New York Post, at the urging of Backer, installing him as publisher and president. When he resigned in 1942, she took up the mantle and became New York's first female newspaper publisher. After divorcing Backer in 1943, she married Ted Thackrey, whom she had earlier installed as editor; it was Thackrey's idea to change the Post's format from a broadsheet to a tabloid. Under her tenure the Post was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare. During the 1940s, The Post featured the most popular columnists of the time, such as Drew Pearson, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Eric Sevareid. She also wrote her own column called \\"Dear Reader\\". In 1945, Schiff launched the Paris Post, the second ever American newspaper to be published in Paris. It lasted until 1948. Thackrey left the Post after a disagreement over whom to support for the presidency in 1948; Thackrey favored Henry A. Wallace whereas Schiff favored Thomas Dewey. This caused Thackrey to resign in 1949, and they divorced a year later. Schiff's fourth husband was Rudolph G. Sonneborn.Time.com The Press: Free Speech for the Boss In 1958, Schiff caused controversy by withdrawing her support at the last minute of Governor Averell Harriman. Though she did not endorse Harriman's opponent, Nelson Rockefeller, the sudden disendorsement of Harriman, which came in the final edition of the Post on the day before the election, swung the vote in Rockefeller's favor and helped launch his political career. Jeffrey Potter's Men, Money and Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff, a biography of Schiff, was published in 1976. It generated significant publicity after The New York Times reported on its front page that Schiff, in the book, claimed to have had an affair with Franklin D. Roosevelt. Schiff denied it said only that had had a \\"relationship\\" with Roosevelt. Schiff sold the Post to Rupert Murdoch, for a reported $31 million (equals $ million in ), in 1976. It is believed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city; also, a change in federal inheritance laws would have affected the value of her estate unless she sold the paper when she did. She remained as an official consultant until 1981, although she played no actual role at the paper. She died at her home in New York City on August 30, 1989. A more complete biography, The Lady Upstairs: Dorothy Schiff and the New York Post by Marilyn Nissenson, was published in 2007. Family Her daughter, Adele Hall Sweet, was married to Beverly Hills mayor A. Fredric Leopold and federal judge Robert W. Sweet. Her son Mortimer W. Hall was married to actress Ruth Roman, actress Diana Lynn, and author Penelope Coker Wilson. Her daughter, Sarah-Ann Backer, was married to public official and art collector Werner H. Kramarsky.

He was elected to the Grantham and Stamford constituency in Lincolnshire at the 2010 general election. He served as Minister of State for Skills from 2014 to 2016. Boles resigned from his local Conservative Association on 16 March 2019 citing differences with his local party. On 1 April 2019, he resigned the party whip, accusing the party of failing to compromise on Brexit. He then sat as an Independent Progressive Conservative until the dissolution of parliament on 5 November. Early life Boles was born on 2 November 1965, the son of Sir Jack Boles, who was later Director-General of the National Trust from 1975 to 1983. He is the great-nephew of Conservative MP Dennis Boles.MPs related to other current or former Members in the 2017 Parliament, House of Commons Library, 26 September 2017. Boles was a scholar at Winchester College before reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, then winning a Kennedy Scholarship to study for a Master's in Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Career In 1995, Boles founded a small DIY supply business, Longwall Holdings Limited, where he is the non-executive chairman, having served as its chief executive until 2000. In 1998, he was elected as a Conservative councillor for the West End ward in Westminster City Council. He was chairman of the council's housing committee from 1999 to 2001, before stepping down in 2002. Boles was considered one of a group of young Conservatives aligned with David Cameron and George Osborne described as the Notting Hill set. He founded the think tank Policy Exchange in 2002 and served as its director until leaving the organisation in 2007. Boles was the Conservative Party candidate for the Labour-held marginal seat of Hove for the 2005 general election. He received media attention during the 2005 election by being an openly gay Conservative candidate for a winnable seat. However, Celia Barlow retained the seat for Labour. He was a candidate in the Conservative primary for the 2008 London mayoral election but withdrew after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Boles recovered from his illness, and in October 2007 was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for Grantham and Stamford, then occupied by Quentin Davies, who had switched allegiance from the Conservatives to Labour earlier in 2007. In May 2008, he was appointed as the Chief of Staff for the new Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson for three months.

Boles was Minister for Planning between November 2012 and August 2014. He introduced a \\"presumption for sustainable development\\" aimed at making new housing development easier, which required councils to create local plans identifying areas that were suitable for further building. In a November 2013 speech, at a conference fringe meeting, he argued that despite their unpopularity the reforms were \\"making the world a slightly better place\\", but that he'd prefer to work in education than planning. In August 2014, Boles was appointed Minister for Skills, which included responsibilities for education and construction. In October 2016, Boles announced that a cancerous tumour had been found in his head and he expected to undergo treatment soon. The following February, he took a trip out of hospital after a third round of chemotherapy in order to vote for the government's bill on withdrawal from the European Union. He announced in April 2017 he would be standing at the 2017 general election. The tumour was eradicated by chemotherapy. =2019 resignation= On 16 March 2019, Boles resigned from his local Conservative Association after disagreeing with them about his rejection of leaving the EU with no deal. The local association had been considering deselecting him as candidate at the next election, due to the disagreement. On 1 April 2019, Boles resigned from the Conservative Party following the announcement of the results of the second round of indicative votes on exiting the European Union. He had been a proponent with Oliver Letwin of the \\"Common Market 2.0\\" proposal, which failed at 261 - 282 votes, and reportedly felt \\"furious\\", \\"upset\\" and \\"let down\\" by fellow MPs who had promised to vote in support of his proposal, and at party whips who had attempted to persuade MPs to abstain on the proposal despite declaring it to be a free vote.The Times 2019-04-02 p.6 paragraphs 1-5 He stated in his resignation speech that:Parliamentary video of resignation speech 2019 - Youtube : \\"I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and political cohesion. I accept that I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise. I regret, therefore, that I can no longer sit for this party.\\" He subsequently described himself as sitting as an \\"Independent Progressive Conservative\\" before leaving Parliament when it was dissolved ahead of the 12 December 2019 election, which he did not contest. =Policy positions= Boles speaking in 2013 Boles has called for the forming of a \\"national liberal\\" faction within the Conservative Party formed of social liberals with conservative fiscal views, and suggested some Conservative candidates might benefit from running for election under that name to win over voters who did not consider themselves conservatives. In July 2012, Boles used a speech at the Resolution Foundation think tank to call for: *An end to winter fuel payments, free prescriptions, free bus travel and free TV licences for better-off pensioners; *A postponement of deciding on full implementation of Andrew Dilnot's solution to the future funding of social care until the next comprehensive spending review; *A cut of £10.5 billion from welfare bills by 2016–17 and devising a better solution to support parenting of young children than the Sure Start programme which he describes as \\"demonstrably ineffective\\".

In 2012, Boles was listed as a participant in that year's Bilderberg Group meeting. Boles supported the Remain campaign in the European Union membership referendum in 2016. Boles favours a Norway-style relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit and strongly opposes a no deal Brexit. Boles said \\"if at any point between now and 29 March [2019] the government were to announce that 'no deal' Brexit had become its policy, I would immediately resign the Conservative whip and vote in any way necessary to stop it from happening.\\"Tory MPs could resign whip if no-deal Brexit becomes primary focus The Guardian. 19 December 2018 Boles supports Land Value Tax. Boles, who had suffered a life-threatening illness before supporting the campaign, is the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life, which believes that terminally ill patients should have the right to an assisted death. Personal life Boles is gay and entered a civil partnership in May 2011. Boles claimed £930.60 in Parliamentary expenses for Hebrew lessons so that he could better communicate with his Israeli boyfriend Shay Meshulam. Following public criticism, he donated money equivalent to the amount spent on the lessons to three local charities in his constituency.

Mashobane, son of chief Mangethe (Zikode), was the chief of the Khumalo tribe: a clan of Nguni people living near the Black Umfolozi river in kwaZulu, in South Africa, and was the father of Mzilikazi the founder of the Ndebele (Matabele) kingdom in Zimbabwe. Matshobana married his first wife, Nompethu KaZwide, who gave birth to Mzilikazi in 1790. It is said that when Mashobane was in charge of a regiment invading a neighbouring tribe he was caught and had his arm amputated and was later set free. In the early 19th century the Khumalo came under pressure to join the Ndwandwe nation due to the expanding power of the Ndwandwe chief, Mashobane's father-in-law, Zwide kaLanga. The alliance was uneasy, and the Khumalos sought help from the leader of the Mthethwa kingdom, Dingiswayo, and his protégé Shaka Zulu. In the course of an attempted invasion of Zwide's territory, Dingiswayo was captured and put to death by Zwide. Shaka Zulu escaped capture only through the help of Chief Donda Khumalo, as a result of which Zwide ordered the deaths of all three Khumalo chiefs, Beje, Donda and Mashobane. Bheje was the only one to escape, Donda was killed and Mashobane was taken captive along with his son, Mzilikazi. In the end Zwide ordered Mashobane to be executed, while Mzilikazi became a lieutenant of Shaka Zulu before leaving him to form the Ndebele kingdom in what is now Zimbabwe. In the 1986 South African TV series, Shaka Zulu, Mashobane was beheaded by Ndwandwe soldiers and his head given to the Sangoma Queen Ntombazi of the Ndwandwe who was Zwide's mother. Ntombazi was a feared wizard. Ntombazi had warned her son, Zwide about keeping Mashobane's head as that will bring misfortune into the Ndwandwe Kingdom. Indeed misfortune befell the kingdom as she had warned. The Ndwandwe kingdom was attacked, destroyed and Ntombazi was killed. Zwide's sons were killed, and his generals fled.

It was registered in 1987 by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, along with the adjoining Alcázar palace complex and the General Archive of the Indies. It is the fourth-largest church in the world (its size remains a matter of debate) as well as the largest Gothic church. After its completion in the early 16th century, Seville Cathedral supplanted Hagia Sophia as the largest cathedral in the world, a title the Byzantine church had held for nearly a thousand years. The total area occupied by the building is . The Gothic section alone has a length of , a width of , and its maximum height in the center of the transept is . The total height of the Giralda tower from the ground to the weather vane is . Seville Cathedral was the site of the baptism of Infant Juan of Aragon in 1478, only son of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Its royal chapel holds the remains of the city's conqueror Ferdinand III of Castile, his son and heir Alfonso the Wise and their descendant king Peter the Just. The funerary monuments for cardinals Juan de Cervantes and Pedro González de Mendoza are located among its chapels. Christopher Columbus and his son Diego are also buried in the cathedral. The Archbishop's Palace is located on the northeastern side of the cathedral. Construction and history Almohad mosque (1172–1248) = The Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf ordered the construction of a new grand mosque for the city in 1172 on the south end of the city. The new mosque was dedicated in 1182, but was not completed until 1198. It supplanted the one built between 829 and 830 by Umar Ibn Adabbas on the site of the present-day collegiate church of Divino Salvador as the main prayer hall in the city. Larger and closer to the city's alcázar, the mosque was designed by the renowned architect Ahmad ben Basso as a rectangular building with a surface of over , including a minaret and ablutions courtyard. Its prayer hall consisted of seventeen aisles oriented southward, perpendicular to its Qibla wall, in the manner of many mosques of Al-Andalus, including the mosque of Ibn Adabbas. = \\"Christianized mosque\\" (1248–1434) = Shortly after Seville's conquest by Ferdinand III, Yaqub Yusuf's mosque was converted into the city's cathedral. Its orientation was changed and its spaces partitioned and adorned to suit Christian worship practices. The internal space was gradually divided into chapels by constructing walls in the bays along the northern and southern walls. Almost the entire eastern half of the cathedral was occupied by the royal chapel that would hold the bodies of Ferdinand, his wife and Alfonso the Wise. = Gothic cathedral (1434–1506, 1511–1517) = Interior of the cathedral. Seville Cathedral was built to demonstrate the city's wealth, as it had become a major trading center in the years after the Reconquista in 1248. In July 1401, city leaders decided to build a new cathedral to replace the grand mosque that served as the cathedral until then. According to local oral tradition, the members of the cathedral chapter said: \\"Hagamos una Iglesia tan hermosa y tan grandiosa que los que la vieren labrada nos tengan por locos\\" (\\"Let us build a church so beautiful and so grand that those who see it finished will take us for mad\\"). The actual entry from 8 July 1401, recorded among others by Juan Cean Bermudes in 1801 but now lost, proposed building \\"una tal y tan buena, que no haya otra su igual\\" (\\"one so good that none will be its equal). Construction continued until 1506. The clergy of the parish offered half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses. Several factors, including royal resistance to the temporary relocation of the royal chapel delayed the start of construction until 1434. On that year, king John II of Castille allowed the temporary transportation of the royal bodies to the cathedral's cloister for storage. Five years after construction ended, in 1511, the crossing lantern, or cimborrio, collapsed and work on the cathedral recommenced. The crossing again collapsed in 1888, and work on the dome continued until at least 1903.GallichanHartley 1903, p. 86 The 1888 collapse occurred due to an earthquake and resulted in the destruction of \\"every precious object below\\" the dome at that time.  Description  700px The interior has the longest nave of any cathedral in Spain. The central nave rises to a height of . In the main body of the cathedral, the most noticeable features are the great boxlike choir loft, which fills the central portion of the nave, and the vast Gothic retablo of carved scenes from the life of Christ. This altarpiece was the lifetime work of a single craftsman, Pierre Dancart. The builders preserved some elements from the ancient mosque. The mosque's sahn, that is, the courtyard for ablutions for the faithful to conduct their ritual cleansing before entering the prayer hall is known today as the Patio de los Naranjos. It contains a fountain and orange trees. However, the most well known is its minaret, which was converted into a bell tower known as La Giralda, and is now the city's most well-known symbol. Giralda La Giralda The Giralda is the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville. Its height is and its square base is above sea level and long per side. The Giralda is the former minaret of the mosque that stood on the site under Muslim rule, and was built to resemble the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakech, Morocco. It was converted into a bell tower for the cathedral after the Reconquista, although the topmost section dates from the Renaissance. It was registered in 1987 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The tower is 104.5 m in height and was one of the most important symbols in the medieval city. Construction began in 1184 under the direction of architect Ben Ahmad Baso. According to the chronicler Ibn Sahib al-Salah, the works were completed on 10 March 1198, with the placement of four gilt bronze balls in the top section of the tower. After a strong earthquake in 1365, the spheres were missing. In the 16th century the belfry was added by the architect Hernán Ruiz the Younger; the statue on its top, called \\"El Giraldillo\\", was installed in 1568 to represent the triumph of the Christian faith. Doors Seville Cathedral has fifteen doors on its four facades. The major doors are: upright=0.66 =West facade= The Door of Baptism, on the left side, was built in the 15th century and decorated with a scene depicting the baptism of Jesus, created by the workshop of Lorenzo Mercadante of Britain. It is of Gothic style with a pointed archivolt decorated with tracery. It contains sculptures of the brothers Saint Isidore and Saint Leander and the sisters Saints Justa and Rufina, by Lorenzo Mecadante, also a series of angels and prophets by the artisan Pedro Millán. The Main Door or Door of Assumption, in the center of the west facade, is well-preserved and elaborately decorated. Cardinal Cienfuegos y Jovellanos commissioned the artist Ricardo Bellver to carve the relief of the Assumption over the door; it was executed between 1877 and 1898. The Door of Saint Michael or Door of the Nativity, has sculptures representing the birth of Jesus by Pedro Millan. It was built in the 15th century and is decorated with terracotta sculptures of Saint Laurean, Saint Hermengild and the Four Evangelists. Today, this door is used for the Holy Week processions. =South facade= The Door of Saint Cristopher or De la Lonja (1887–1895) of the south transept, was designed by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova and completed in 1917; it was originally designed by the architect Demetrio de los Rios in 1866. A replica of the \\"Giraldillo\\" stands in front of its gate. =North facade= Door of the Conception, in the North facade The Door of the Conception (1895–1927, Puerta de la Concepción) opens onto the Court of the Oranges (Patio de los Naranjos) and is kept closed except on festival days. It was designed by Demetrio de los Rios and finished by Adolfo Fernandez Casanova in 1895. It was built in the Gothic style to harmonize with the rest of the building. The Door of the Lizard (Puerta del Lagarto) leads from the Court of the Oranges; it is named for the stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling. The Door of the Sanctuary (Puerta del Sagrario) provides access to the sanctuary. Designed by Pedro Sanchez Falconete in the last third of the 17th century, it is framed by Corinthian columns with a sculpture on top representing King Ferdinand III of Castile next to the Saints Isidore, Leander, Justa and Rufina. Door of Forgiveness (Puerta del Perdón) gives access to the Patio de los Naranjos (Patio of the Oranges) from Calle Alemanes and therefore is not really a door of the cathedral. It belonged to the ancient mosque and retains its horseshoe arch shape from that time. In the early 16th century it was adorned with terracotta sculptures by the sculptor Miguel Perrin, highlighting the great relief of the Purification on the entrance arch. The plaster ornaments were made by Bartolomé López. =East facade= The Door of Sticks or the Adoration of the Magi (Puerta de Palos or Puerta de la Adoración de los Magos) decorated with sculptures by Lope Marin in 1548, has a relief of the Adoration of the Magi at the top, executed by Miguel Perrin in 1520. The name \\"Palos\\" or \\"Sticks\\" is due to the wooden railing which separates that area from the rest of the building. Door of the Bells (Puerta de las Campanillas) was so named because at the time of its construction the bells to call the workers were rung there. The Renaissance sculptures and the relief on the tympanum representing Christ's Entry into Jerusalem were made by Lope Marin in 1548.

The baptistery Chapel of Saint Anthony contains the painting of The Vision of St. Anthony (1656) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. In November 1874, it was discovered that thieves had cut out the portion depicting Saint Anthony. Then, in January 1875, a Spanish immigrant attempted to sell the same fragment to a New York City art gallery. The man stated it was a complete original by Murillo, Saint Anthony being one of the artist's favorite subjects. The owner of the gallery, Hermann Schaus, negotiated a price of $250 and contacted the Spanish consulate. Upon securing the sale, Schaus sent it to the Spanish Consulate, which shipped it to Seville via Havana and Cadiz.  Organ  The cathedral originally hosted a pair of historic instruments: a Gospel organ by the renowned innovator Jordi Bosch, finished in 1793, and an Epistle organ by Valentín and José Valentín Verdalonga, finished in 1831. Neither survived the 1888 earthquake. They were replaced in 1901–1903 with twin organs by Aquilino Amezua. These were converted to electrical control in 1973 and are now played from a single four- manual console on the floor between them. The organ was then reworked by Gerhard Grenzing in 1996, adding some more traditional Baroque capabilities to this romantic-symphonic instrument.

He was born in La Ceiba in Honduras. Career Azcona spent the years from 1935 to 1949 living in Cantabria, Spain with his maternal grandparents. He grew up there during the Spanish Civil War. He returned to Honduras in 1949, working in his family's trading company. He then went to study in the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) graduating in civil engineering, with postgraduate studies from the University of Monterrey in Mexico. President (1986-1990) As the PLH were unable to decide on a single candidate they ended up fielding four candidates, including Azcona, against the one National Party of Honduras (PNH) candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero. Because the PLH candidates gained 51.5% of the vote between them, and as Azcona gained the highest of the 4, he gained the presidency with only 27.5% of the vote, even though Callejas gained 42.6% of the vote. This was the first transfer of power from one constitutional, elected president to another since 1948, and the first time it happened democratically since 1932. Azcona's success as a president has been contested across the political spectrum. While his followers and a large proportion of the population would favour him due to the perceived honesty and integrity of his government, another group would challenge this view, arguing that he pursued a weak economic policy (artificially maintaining a 2:1 exchange rate between the Honduran lempira and the US dollar), ran up large budget deficits and did little to develop investment opportunities in the country. Many people still remember the fuel supply problems, mostly in the last part of his government due to foreign credit issues. During his presidency, the Central American peace process took place, by the time he turned over the presidency to his successor on 27 January 1990 the Contra rebels in Nicaragua were demobilising. Less known is the relationship between Honduras and the US Government covert operations to exchange arms for hostages in Iran and fund rebels, later known as Iran ContraAffair. Post-presidency After leaving power Azcona concentrated on running his construction business. At the end of the nineties he had a heart attack. On 24 October 2005 at 12.30 a.m. (local time UTC−6) just as he was going to bed in his home in Tegucigalpa Azcona died suddenly from another heart attack, age 78. Trivia * Azcona's last trip was to Pensacola, Florida where he met with his wife's (Miriam Bocock de Azcona) side of the family before he died. * His son José Azcona Bocock is currently an elected Congressman. * His daughter Elizabeth Azcona Bocock was Minister of Industry and Commerce for the first half of Mel Zelaya's presidency.

Their work, also strongly influenced by progressive metal and black metal, commonly incorporates elaborate arrangements often featuring multiple sections and unpredictable time changes. Biography The band was started when guitarists Peter and G'Ames, formerly of Blaspherion, asked Jaro.Slav, the vocalist of Haemorrhage, to join their new project. Jackie (bass guitar) and Aemil (drums) joined the band few weeks later, followed by keyboard player U'reck after the band's first rehearsal session. After the recording in 1996 of the band's first full album, Forever Alone, Immortal, Aemil was replaced by drummer Kriss. The band's second album, Dionysos, followed in 1997. In 1998, after the release of Maior Arcana, G'Ames and Jackie were asked to leave the band; their replacements were guitarist Vogg and bassist Martin, also of the Polish death metal band Decapitated. A lengthy recording succession with the new lineup yielded My Guardian Anger, which was released in 1999. The latter half of 1999 was plagued with accidents, though, as Kriss suffered from a broken arm, leading his doctors to question whether he'd ever be able to play drums again, and U'reck broke his leg shortly thereafter, forcing the band to retire from touring for several months. After several months' hiatus from performing, the band played Poland's Metalmania festival in 2000 alongside acts such as Opeth, Behemoth and Tiamat, which drew the attention of the Portuguese label Maquiavel Music Entertainment. The next month they were signed to the label for a two-album deal, and the first of their albums on MME, The Mother and the Enemy, appeared the following year. The band has been mostly dormant since 2002, although in 2012 they posted a message to their MySpace some years afterward indicating that they were working on new material and looking for a new drummer. Finally, in 2014 they released their fifth studio album Kołysanki which drastically departed from the previous avangarde-black sound of the band.

It was created in 1996. About 1148 were manufactured. Description Safe Cracker differs from a standard pinball game in that the player is playing against the clock as opposed to having a certain number of balls available. If the player loses a ball, as long as there is time left on the clock they can continue playing. The machine is smaller in size than a standard pinball machine. The main objective of the game is to break into the bank's safe. The game can be broken into 3 areas of play: * The pinball playfield has numerous targets, the completion of which will allow entry into the bank via the rooftop, the cellar, or the front door. * Once the player has entered the bank, the game changes to a boardgame that takes place on the backglass. Using the flipper buttons to make choices, the player spins a dial that is numbered 1 through 5 and moves their piece around the board while being chased by the security guard who rolls a six sided die. The object of this portion of the game is to advance to the center of the game board (where the safe is located) before being caught by the guard. If the player is successful, the game will eject a \\"magic token\\" from the bank vault for the player to catch as it rolls down the playfield glass. * After the player is done with the regular game, they can deposit their \\"magic token\\" into the token slot of the machine to activate a special game mode called \\"Assault on the Vault\\". In this frenzied 4-ball multiball mode, players have 90 seconds to hit as many drop target and ramp shots as possible to break into the bank vault.

The Argentines mounted amphibious landings and the invasion ended with the surrender of Falkland Government House. Defence Governor Rex Hunt was informed by the British Government of a possible Argentine invasion on 1 April 1982. At 3:30 pm that day he received a telegram from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stating: =Forces involved= The Governor summoned the two senior Royal Marines of Naval Party 8901 to Government House in Stanley to discuss the options for defending the Falklands.

The total strength was 68 Marines and 11 sailors from the Antarctic patrol ship Endurances survey team, commanded by RN Lieutenant Chris Todhunter.

The Royal Navy and author Russell Phillips state that a total of 85 marines were present at Stanley.\\"Consequently, there were 85 Royal Marines on the islands, with 25 men of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, although some retired members of the FIDF also reported for duty that around 40 men were available for the FIDF.\\" A Damn Close-Run Thing, Russell Phillips, Shilka Publishing, 2011 Their numbers were reinforced by at least 25 Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) members.Anderson, pp. 17–19. Graham Bound, an islander who lived through the Argentine occupation, reports in his book Invasion 1982: Falkland Islanders at War that the higher figure of 40 members\\"Meanwhile the Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF) was preparing for the invasion quite independently of the Marines. Their OC, Major Phil Summers, had tasked the approximately forty parttime militiamen to guard such key points as the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station.\\" Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, Graham Bound, Page 45, Casemate Publishers, 2007 (including 15 ex-FIDF members) of the FIDF reported for duty at their drill hall. Their commanding officer, Major Phil Summers, tasked the volunteer militiamen (including his son Brian Summers) with guarding such key points as the telephone exchange, the radio station and the power station. Skipper Jack Sollis, on board the civilian coastal ship Forrest, operated his boat as an improvised radar screen station off Stanley. Four other civilians, former Royal Marines Jim Fairfield and Anthony Davies,\\"Anthony Davies, known as 'Taff', was the only experienced soldier among them. Taff had been a Marine and met his wife Jackie when serving with Naval Party 8901 in the late 1970s. He left the Corps in 1979 and settled in Stanley. That night he felt he had to do something to help and became the FIDF's newest member.\\" Bound: Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, p. 46 a Canadian citizen, Bill Curtiss and Rex Hunt's chauffeur, Don Bonner\\"Rex Hunt's chauffeur and major-domo Don Bonner was deeply attached to his boss and Government House, where he had a grace-and-favour cottage.

Rex Hunt himself was armed with a Browning 9 mm pistol. Rex Hunt himself was armed with a Browning 9 mm pistol. Prior to the main Argentine landings, nine of the British sailors present were placed under the command of the Chief Secretary, Dick Baker, and rounded up 30 Argentine nationals living in Port Stanley and placed them in protective custody next to the Police Station.\\"Led by Colour Sergeant J. Noone RM, and accompanied by the Chief Secretary as the representative of the civil power, they had rounded up thirty Argentine nationals residents in Port Stanley by 4.00am, placing them in protective custody.\\" The Royal Navy and Falklands War, David Brown, p.57, Pen & Sword, 1987 He recalls: The nine sailors came back to Government House, where they established an information service, leaving the prisoners in custody of RN Lieutenant Richard Ball.Nick Van Der Bijl (2007), p. 15 Operation Rosario The Argentine amphibious operation began in the late evening of Thursday 1 April, when the destroyer disembarked special naval forces south of Stanley. The bulk of the Argentine force was to land some hours later from the amphibious warfare ship near the airport on a beach previously marked by frogmen from the submarine . The operation had been called Azul (Blue) during the planning stage, but it was finally renamed Rosario.Ruiz Moreno, p. 21 =ARA Santa Fe= Rosario began with the reconnaissance of Port William by the submarine ARA Santa Fe and the landing of 14 members of the near Cape Pembroke, including the commander of this elite unit, Lieutenant-Commander Alfredo Raúl Cufré. The reconnaissance mission began as early as 31 March, when the trawler Forrest was spotted through the periscope at 10:00 p.m. off Port Stanley. The next day, Santa Fe learned that the authorities in Stanley were aware of the Argentine plans, so a change was necessary. Instead of landing right on Pembroke, the commandos would initially take a beach nearby.Bóveda, Jorge (2007). La Odisea del submarino Santa Fe. IPN editores, pp. 56, 75–76. The commandos left Santa Fe at 1:40 p.m. and from the beach headed towards Pembroke peninsula in Zodiac boats. They reached Yorke Bay at 4:30 a.m. on 2 April. After planting beacons for the main landing, they took over the airfield and the lighthouse without encountering significant resistance. After the British surrender at Port Stanley, this team was given the task of gathering the Royal Marines and taking them into custody. =Attack on Moody Brook barracks= On the night of 1–2 April 1982, Santísima Trinidad halted off Mullet Creek and lowered 21 Gemini assault craft into the water. They contained 84 special forces troopersBusser, Operación Rosario. The force was composed of 76 Amphibious Commandos and 8 members of the Buzos Tácticos (tactical divers) elite group. of Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Sánchez-Sabarots's 1st Amphibious Commandos Group and a small partyThe so-called Patrulla Techo (Roof patrol). under Lieutenant-Commander Pedro Giachino, who was second-in-command of the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion and had volunteered for the mission\\"Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Pedro Giachino, who was the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion Second-in-Command, and had volunteered for the mission, approached Government House with eight amphibious commandos and the eight tactical divers.\\" Victory in the Falklands, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 18, Pen & Sword, 2007 to capture Government House. Argentine Rear Admiral Jorge Allara, through a message radioed from Santisima Trinidad, had requested from Rex Hunt a peaceful surrender, but the request was rejected. Giachino's party had the shortest distance to go: two and a half miles due north. Moody Brook Barracks, the destination of the main party, was away over rough terrain. Sánchez-Sabarots, in the book The Argentine Fight for the Falklands, described the main party's progress in the dark: > It was a nice night, with a moon, but the cloud covered the moon for most of > the time. It was very hard going with our heavy loads; it was hot work. We > eventually became split up into three groups. We only had one night sight; > the lead man, Lieutenant Arias had it. One of the groups became separated > when a vehicle came along the track we had to cross. We thought it was a > military patrol. Another group lost contact, and the third separation was > caused by someone going too fast. This caused my second in command, > Lieutenant Bardi, to fall. He suffered a hairline fracture of the ankle and > had to be left behind with a man to help him. We were at Moody Brook by 5.30 > a.m., just on the limits of the time planned, but with no time for the one > hour's reconnaissance for which we had hoped. The main party of Argentine Marines assumed that the Moody Brook Barracks contained sleeping Royal Marines. The barracks were quiet, although a light was on in the office of the Royal Marine commander. No sentries were observed, and it was a quiet night. Sánchez-Sabarots could hear nothing suggesting any action at Government House nor from the distant landing beaches. Nevertheless, he ordered the assault to begin. Sánchez-Sabarots's account continued: > It was still completely dark. We were going to use tear-gas to force the > British out of the buildings and capture them. Our orders were not to cause > casualties if possible. That was the most difficult mission of my career. > All our training as commandos was to fight aggressively and inflict maximum > casualties on the enemy. We surrounded the barracks with machine-gun teams, > leaving only one escape route along the peninsula north of Stanley Harbour. > Anyone who did get away would not able to reach the town and reinforce the > British there. Then we threw the gas grenades into each building. There was > no reaction; the barracks were empty. The noise of the grenades alerted Major Norman to the presence of Argentines on the island, so he drove back to Government House. Realising that the attack was coming from Moody Brook, he ordered all troop sections to converge on Government House to enable the defence to be centralised. Around this time, most of the Falkland Islands Defence Force received similar orders and fell back to Drill Hall. Sergeant Gerald Cheek from the FIDF recalled: \\"We were requested to phone in to HQ whenever possible, and when I made the routine call at 06.00 hours Phil Summers informed me that the Governor had said FIDF members were not to engage with the enemy under any circumstances, and they were to surrender when ordered to do so without offering any resistance.\\"Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, Graham Bound, p. 46, Casemate Publishers, 2007 Although there were no Royal Marine witnesses to the assault, British descriptions of the state of Moody Brook barracks afterwards contradict the Argentine version of events. After the Royal Marines were allowed to return to barracks to collect personal items. Norman describes walls of the barracks as riddled with machine gun fire and bearing the marks of white phosphorus grenades – \\"a classic houseclearing operation\\". The Argentines maintain that the barracks were damaged in an air attack by Harriers from No. 1 Squadron RAF on 12 June 1982—involving Flight Lieutenant Mark Hare and Wing Commander Peter Squire—that killed three conscripts and wounded their commander.\\"El día anterior el fuego británico había alcanzado los cuarteles de Moody Brook, donde mató a tres soldados e hirió al mayor José Rodolfo Banetta, de la compañía comando de la Brigada X.\\" Isidoro J. Ruiz Moreno, La Lucha Por La Capital (chapter), Comandos en Acción: El Ejercito en Malvinas, Emece, 1986\\"El Jefe de Personal del Comando de las Fuerzas Terrestres que, hasta ese entonces, había permanecido con su Sección en el Cuartel de los Marines (Moody Brook), el Mayor del Ejército Don José R. Banetta, que debía replegarse de las instalaciones mencionadas hacia su Puesto de Comando Principal en la localidad, al incendiarse y destruirse los cuarteles, por un efectivo y preciso ataque de la aviación enemiga.\\" Carlos H. Robacio, Jorge Hernández, p. 216, Desde el Frente: Batallón de Infantería de Marina No. 5, Centro Naval, 1996\\"Los ataques aéreos continuaban pero en forma cada vez más esporádica, quizá el último bombardeo importante fue sobre el ex- cuartel de los Royal Marines en Moody Brooki donde funcionaba el PC Ret de la Agr Ej a órdenes del My Banetta. Produjo bajas y grandes daños en el cuartel.\\" Horacio Rodríguez Mottino, p. 182, La Artillería Argentina en Malvinas, Clio, 1984 =Amphibious landing at Yorke Bay= There was a more pressing action on the eastern edge of Stanley. Twenty LVTP-7A1 Argentine tracked amphibious armoured personnel carriers from Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Cazzaniga's 1st Amphibious Vehicles Battalion, carrying D and E Companies of the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM-2) from Puerto Belgrano, had been landed from the tank landing ship ARA Cabo San Antonio at Yorke Bay, and were being watched by a section of Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Bill Trollope. Two Argentine-built landing craft also took part in the landings later that morning and would fall into British hands at the end of the fighting in June. The armoured column drove along the Airport Road into Stanley, with three Amtracs in the vanguard, and, near the Ionospheric Research Station, at exactly 7:15 a.m., was engaged by a section of Royal Marines with anti-tank rockets and machine guns. Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillán later wrote an official post-battle report. The Amtrac on the right manoeuvred itself off the road into a little depression and as it did so, disembarked the Marines inside—including one wounded, Private Horacio Tello—out of view. This encouraged the Royal Marines to think that Gibbs had scored a direct hit on the passenger compartment of the APC. According to Santillán, this vehicle took 97 rounds and another lost its tracks.FORO DE LA CIUDAD – OPERACIÓN ROSARIO por HUGO JORGE SANTILLAN Trollope, with No. 2 Section, describes the action: \\"Six Armoured Personnel Carriers began advancing at speed down the Airport Road. The first APC was engaged at a range of about 200 to 250 metres. The first three missiles, two 84 mm and one 66 mm, missed. Subsequently one 66 mm fired by Marine [Mark] Gibbs hit the passenger compartment and one 84 mm Marines [George] Brown and [Danny] Betts hit the front. Both rounds exploded and no fire was received from that vehicle. The remaining five APCs which were about 600 to 700 metres away deployed their troops and opened fire. We engaged them with GPMG, SLR and sniper rifle [Sergeant Ernie Shepherd] for about a minute before we threw a white phosphorus smoke grenade and leap-frogged back to the cover of gardens. Incoming fire at that stage was fairly heavy, but mostly inaccurate.\\"Bound, pp. 52–53. According to Governor Hunt in his memoirs, Marines Brown and Betts brought the leading Amtrac to a screeching halt with a direct hit in one of the forward tracks while Marine Gibbs scored another hit in the passenger compartment: \\"About this time, we received the heartening news that the section led by Mike's second-in-command, Bill Trollope, had knocked out the first APC. They put an 84mm rocket into the tracks and a 66mm rocket into the passenger compartment. They stood ready to shoot anybody who got out, but nobody did.\\"My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 238, David & Charles, 1992 Trollope and his men withdrew along Davis Street, running behind the houses with Argentine Marines in hot pursuit, and went to ground firing up the road when it became obvious they could not reach Government House.Bound, p. 58 Corporal Lou Armour, commanding '1 Section', was positioned at Hookers Point when the invasion began. Shortly after the attack on Moody Brook, he was ordered to withdraw to Government House, meeting up with Corporal David Carr's section along the way. \\"The marines, now numbering sixteen, decided to try and work their way around to the back of the ridge where the Argentinians were positioned, and then charge down to Government House, hopefully taking the enemy by surprise. But as they moved through the edges of the town they came under fire at every street corner and it was eventually so heavy they had to abandon their plan.\\"The Sunday Times Insight Team, 1982 p. 12. Sphere Books Ltd. As both sections headed off to find Trollope's men, Armour decided to have one more try at getting into Government House. Using fire and manoeuvre to cross a football pitch they then crawled along the hedgerow leading to the gardens where they experienced friendly fire. According to Armour: \\"I had a running battle with a bunch of Argentines in armored vehicles who were chasing me and my section back toward Stanley. When we eventually got to government house, we were taking fire from three directions: the Argentines who were attacking the house, both behind and in front, and our own guys, who were in the house and thought we were another Argentine snatch squad trying to get in. So that was a bit hairy. An Argentine was killed that day and a few more wounded.\\" They eventually made it to safety via the kitchen door. Again according to Armour: \\"One Section pepper-potted down the road towards the wood where we knew Government House to be. Movement was slow as we had to crawl and monkey run until we reached the hospital. It was now broad daylight. From there the section fired and manoeuvred behind the nurses' home and across the football pitch until we reached a hedgegrow. I informed Marine Parker to call out, 'Royal Marines!' as we approached the house. We were eventually heard by Corporal Pares, who told us where the enemy were. The section, under cover from Corporal Pares, then dashed into the house where we were deployed upstairs by Major Noott.\\"Graham Bound, Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, p. 54, Casemate Publishers, 2007 In the meantime, Corporal Stefan York and his section had been patiently manning their hiding place on the western end of Navy Point. As Argentine landing craft were reported approaching Stanley Harbour, Marine Rick Overall fired a Carl Gustav anti-tank round which the British, in an interview with military historian Martin Middlebrook, claimed to have penetrated the side of an Argentine Marine Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, killing all on board.Operation Corporate (Viking, 1985), Martin Middlebrook, p. 51 According to Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Jorge Santillán, an Amtrack Amphibious Recovery Vehicle around this time had entered Stanley Harbour after the capture of Government House, to carry out emergency repairs on the two amphibious armoured personnel carriers that had been damaged in the earlier gun-battle near the Ionospheric Research Station.2 de abril de 1982 MALVINAS: Vehículos Anfibios Major Mike Norman wrote in his book about the Navy Point defenders: \\"All well and good, but if an enemy landing craft had been sunk in the Narrows, by Corporal York's 4 Section, I would certainly have heard about it – they were in constant radio contact with my HQ. No such incident was ever mentioned.\\"Mike Norman, Michael K. Jones, The Falklands War, There and Back Again: The Story of Naval Party 8901, p. 149, Pen & Sword Books Limited, 2019 =Battle of Government House= Lying on a small hillock south of Government House, Lieutenant-Commander Pedro Giachino faced the difficulty of capturing this tactically important objective with no radio and with a force of only sixteen men. He split his force into small groups, placing one on either side of the house and one at the rear. Unknown to them, the governor's residence was the main concentration point of the Royal Marines, who outnumbered the commandos by over two to one. The first attack against this building came at 6.30 a.m., barely an hour before the Yorke Bay amphibious landing, when one of Giachino's squads, led by Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Lugo,Busser, p. 259 started to exchange fire with the British troops inside the house. At the same time, Giachino himself, with four of his subordinates, entered the servants' annex, believing it to be the rear entrance to the residence. Four Royal Marines, Corporals Mick Sellen and Colin Jones and Marines Harry Dorey and Murray Paterson,\\"Corporal Mick Sellen, who with Marine Paterson had shot the three Argentines in the chicken run, had reported to Gary that he had seen three others make for the staff quarters, and he suspected that they were still there.\\" My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 233, David & Charles, 1992 who were placed to cover the annex, beat off the first attack. Giachino was hit instantly as he burst through the door, while Lieutenant Diego Garcia Quiroga was shot in the arm. The remaining three retreated to the maid's quarters. Giachino was not dead, but very badly wounded. An Argentine combat medic, Corporal Ernesto Urbina, attempted to get to Giachino but was wounded by a grenade. Giachino, seeing what had happened, pulled the pin from a hand grenade and threatened to use it. The Royal Marines then attempted to persuade the officer to get rid of the grenade so that they could give him medical treatment, but he refused, preventing them from reaching his position. After the surrender of the British forces at Government House, some three hours later, Major Giachino was taken to Stanley Hospital but died from loss of blood.Busser, page 277 At the governor's office, Major Norman received a radio report from Corporal York's section, which was positioned at Camber peninsula, observing any possible Argentine ship entering Stanley Harbour. The corporal proceeded to report on three potential targets in sight and ask which he should engage first. \\"What are the targets?\\" the major enquired. \\"Target number one is an aircraft carrier, target number two is a cruiser\\", at which point the line went dead. After firing a rocket at an amphibious vehicle heading to Yorke Bay, York decided to withdraw his section and proceeded to booby trap their Carl Gustav recoilless rifle, before paddling their Gemini assault boat north across Port William. As he did so, York said they were chased and fired upon by an Argentine destroyer (either the corvette ARA Drummond or Granville). His initiative led to the Gemini reaching an anchored Polish fishing vessel and hiding the small assault boat under her shadow. They patiently waited for a chance, before moving to the shore and landing on a small beach. Argentine sources say the Drummond laid down suppressing fire on a cove north of Port William where unidentified personnel had been spotted, in support of Cabo San Antonio, whose crew had reported a \\"missile falling short to starboard\\", apparently launched from the area. Other Argentine navy's reports claim that the action at Port Williams was carried out by . Back at Government House, the Argentine commandos' pressure continued. There is some evidence that their use of stun grenades, mistaken as high-explosive rifle-grenades and/or mortars,\\"The noise for a while was deafening. It numbed the senses, like an anaesthetic, and made thinking a conscious effort. We surmised later that the Argentines were throwing stun grenades but, at the time, we thought we were being mortared. Outbursts of automatic and rifle fire interspersed the bangs. My first rational thought was surprise that the windows had not shattered. My second was to wonder why we had no pieces of metal flying round.\\" My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, p. 226, David & Charles, 1992 and their continuous shift of firing positions during the battle led the Royal Marines inside to believe they were facing a large company of marines and were hopelessly outnumbered. Actually, after the failure of Giachino's small platoon to break into the residence, the British were surrounded by only a dozen amphibious commandos. These men were under Lieutenant Lugo, Giachino's second-in-command. The Land Rovers used by the Royal Marines were disabled by automatic gunfire from the commandos.Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter VIII: An Ungentlemanly Act, p. 88 Governor Hunt called Patrick Watts—at the radio station, Radio Stanley—by telephone and said he believed the assaulting force to be the equivalent of a reinforced company: \\"We're staying put here, but we are pinned down. We can't move.(...) They must have 200 around us now. They've been throwing rifle grenades at us; I think there may be mortars, I don't know. They came along very quickly and very close, and then they retreated. Maybe they are waiting until the APCs [Amtracs] come along and they think they'll lose less casualties that way.\\"Bound, page 60Way, p. 134, increases the number of Argentine troops around the House to 600.Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter VIII: An Ungentlemanly Act, p. 89 Corporals Geordie Gill and Terry Pares, both snipers, also claimed to have shot several Argentines through the chest and head as they attempted to scatter along the hillside overlooking Government House: \\"We dropped a number of Argentinians as they approached and I had a couple in my sights and made sure they were taken out of the game. It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies that we saw drop in front of us.\\"David Reynolds, p. 21, Task force: The Illustrated History of the Falklands War, Sutton, 2002 Major Norman's estimate is that Corporals Pares and Gills killed or wounded some four or five Argentine special forces: \\"Corporals Pares and Gill, were doing an excellent job. Gill would look through his sniper scope and tell Pares where the enemy were and Pares would fire ten rounds rapid, and as soon as that got them on the move, Gill would take them out with the sniper rifle. They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.\\"Max Arthur, p. 17, Above All, Courage: The Falklands Front Line: First-Hand Accounts, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1985 In the official history of both sides, Argentine casualties are listed as one killed and three badly wounded outside Government House. Another three Argentine Marines (Private Horacio Tello, Padre Ángel Maffezini and Lieutenant-Commander Hugo Santillán) were injured taking cover in the skirmishes in and around Port Stanley. During the gun-battle, Kenneth Clarke was one of four British correspondents covering the events from the home of the Governor's Secretary as the Argentine Marine Special Forces sheltering behind hedges and rocks attacked Government House less than 100 metres away. Clarke could hear the gunfire and feel the explosions. As dawn broke a bullet from an Argentine sniper came through a bedroom window and parted his hair. Around 7.30 a.m., the local police commander Ronnie Lamb, had to order two Royal Falkland Islands Police officers to nearby Government House, in order to rescue a civilian, Henry Halliday, as he blissfully headed off to work, despite the fierce gun-battle taking place all around him.\\"Yesterday morning Ronnie Lamb, the police chief, had to get his officers to rescue old Henry Halliday from the front road, as he had set off for work as usual, through the main part of the invasion, just after seven.\\" 74 Days: An Islander's Diary of the Falklands Occupation, John Smith, p. 33. Century, 1984 Eventually, Hunt decided to enter talks with Argentine commanders around 8:30 a.m., after Major Norman warned him \\"that our defence would be determined, unrelenting—but would be relatively short-lived\\".\\"At 0830 Major Norman advised the Governor on various military options. He realised that the enemy had overwhelming numerical superiority and although he would have liked to break out, taking the Governor with him, and set up a seat of Government elsewhere in the Islands, he had no doubt that if they continued as they were, they would be soon overrun. He told the Governor 'that our defence would be determined, unrelenting-but would be relatively short-lived'. The Governor got in touch with Vice Commodore Hector Gilobert, the Argentine representative of Lade, and asked his help in contacting the Argentine Commander, Admiral Carlos Busser.\\" THIS WEEK'S GLOBE & LAUREL – July/August 1982 The liaison was Vice-Commodore Hector Gilobert, the head in the islands of LADE, the Argentine government's airline company. Gilobert and a governor's deputy went to the Argentine headquarters displaying a white flag. A de facto ceasefire was put in place at that time which was occasionally breached by small arms fire.Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter I: Surrender (I), p. 20. The governor's envoys found the Argentine command post at Stanley's town hall. The Argentine commander accepted the British offer of a face to face meeting with Hunt in his battered office. While the negotiations were still going on, another incident occurred inside the residence. Three Argentine amphibious commandos who survived the first skirmish along the compound inadvertently alerted Major Noott to their presence, while they had been preparing to leave their hiding place. The Major fired his Sterling submachine gun into the ceiling of the maid's room. According to British reports, the stunned commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground. They became the first Argentine prisoners of war of the Falklands War, although by then Governor Hunt had already been in contact with Argentine officials negotiating the terms of surrender.Busser, p. 40 The version of Lieutenant Commander Cufré, who was then at Stanley airport, is that the three Amphibious Commandos supporting Giachino's party kept their positions right to the end of the hostilities.Insight team Sunday Time (1982), Chapter I: Surrender (I), page 20. Instead, in an article published by an Argentine newspaper, the 1982 commander of the Tactical Divers Group (Buzos Tácticos) states that the three men withstood a fierce three-hour gun battle with the Royal Marines.La Voz del Interior newspaper, 1 April 2007 Admiral Carlos Büsser, commander in chief of the operation, states that a ceasefire was already in place when the three commandos, after realising that the battle was coming to a close and that any loss of life at the time would be futile, laid down their arms to the marines in order to assist the wounded. Just a few minutes after this event, Government House capitulated. Surrender Meanwhile, the Royal Marines in the house saw the approaching Amtracs that had been engaged earlier by Lieutenant Trollope and his section. The Amtracs were Rex Hunt's biggest problem, because they could take up positions outside the range of the Royal Marines and blast Government House to pieces.\\"The Amtracks were the Marines' biggest problem, because they could stand off outside the British troops' range and blast Government House to pieces. After telephoning various people in Port Stanley to ascertain the outside situation, Governor Hunt reluctantly agreed to see the commander of the Argentine forces present, Admiral Busser.\\" The World's Elite Forces, Bruce Quarrie, p. 64, Berkley Books, 1988 The vehicles pushed on toward Moody Brook to link up with Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Sánchez-Sabarots. His amphibious commandos were plodding slowly along the road to reinforce their colleagues besieging Government House after taking some prisoners near the racecourse.\\"En su trayecto [el grupo de comandos] recibió la rendición de una patrulla de ocho soldados ingleses, en proximidades del Hipódromo, y momentos después se encontraron, de acuerdo con lo previsto y como hemos visto, con la Vanguardia de la Fuerza de Desembarco, que debía rastrillar la parte norte de la península de Camber\\". Mayorga, p. 77These troops seem to have been FIDF men on patrol around Stanley's racecourse in order to prevent helicopter landings (Telegraph.co.uk). The majority of the FIDF soldiers were captured inside Drill Hall, where they had barricaded themselves a few hours earlier with one section captured near Government House and escorted back to the hall to join their fellow reservists.\\"The FIDF were disarmed in their drill hall, where they had been since returning section by section a few hours earlier. One group had been intercepted by the Argentines not far from Government House. Lined up against a wall with weapons levelled against them, they briefly thought their time was up. But after a tense few minutes, they were escorted to the drill hall, like the rest of the FIDF, eventually taken home under armed guard. Some, perhaps most, of the Defence Force were unhappy about their early withdrawal and at least one section on guard to the south of the town had sent a runner back to the HQ questioning the order. They had, however, at least avoided the humiliating final act of the Marines' drama. On the road outside Government House, over-zealous Argentines forced the Marines to lie face down with arms outstretched. Argentine photographer Rafael Wollman snapped sensational pictures, which were splashed across front pages around the world.\\" Invasion 1982: The Falkland Islanders' Story, Graham Bound, pp. 68–69, Casemate Publishers, 2007 Two other sections were captured with the fall of Government House and ordered to lie face down with the Royal Marines.\\"We watched sadly as Argentine soldiers assembled our Royal Marines on the lawn in front of us. We were alarmed to see some members of the FIDF. They were Gerald Cheek's and Pat Peck's sections, who had been caught between the Argentines attacking Moody Brook and those surrounding Government House.\\" My Falkland Days, Rex Hunt, Page 238, David & Charles, 1992 In the meantime, the naval detachment from HMS Endurance at Government House began to shred official documents. Major Norman had earlier advised Governor Hunt that the Royal Marines and the governor could break out to the countryside and set up a 'seat of government' elsewhere, but when he finally met the commander of the Argentine seaborne forces, Admiral Büsser, he agreed to surrender his troops to the now overwhelming Argentine forces at 9:30 a.m. It was a hard decision for Governor Hunt to make: \\"With a heavy heart, I turned to Mike and told him to give the order to lay down arms. I could not bring myself to use the word 'Surrender'. Mike's face was a mixture of relief and anguish: it was not part of his training to surrender, but his good sense told him that there was no real alternative. As Gary accompanied Busser to tend the wounded round Government House, Mike told his radio operator to instruct all sections to down arms and wait to be collected.\\"Rex Hunt, p. 234, My Falkland Days, David & Charles, 1992 While Major Noott accompanied Busser outside Government House, the British officer applied morphine and the tourniquet on the Argentine wounded that would staunch the heavy bleeding and, Lieutenant Diego García Quiroga would later say Noott saved his life. He was rushed to Stanley Hospital where two doctors operated on him after cutting through his heavy clothing using scissors. Corporal Ernesto Urbina was given plasma in Stanley Hospital which saved his life.\\"Fui entonces al hospital donde al lado del cuerpo del Capitán Giacchino se encontraba en otra camilla el Cabo Urbina al que le estaban suminstrando plasma.\\" Operación Rosario, Carlos Busser, p. 327, Editorial Atlántida, 1984 Before Hunt's capitulation, Sánchez-Sabarots had to order a section of his men to release the Argentine nationals that Vice- Commodore Gilobert reported were being held under guard inside Town Hall. But, before they could arrive Commander Alfredo Raúl Weinstabl and his adjutant, Lieutenant Juan Carlos Martinelli and several marines from his tactical headquarters secured the Town Hall and Stanley Police Station buildings. According to Weinstabl: \\"The town was silent. Arriving at the place we had chosen as the Battalion Command Post, we found abandoned weapons and packs. I ordered Lieutenant Martinelli to recce the building and within a short while he returned with about thirty men and women who came out of it smiling. They were Argentines who had been locked in that place the night before. Almost opposite was the Police Station.

The Falklands Governor disputed Argentine claims that the seaborne assault resulted in only one Argentine dead and two wounded, telling Time Magazine reporters Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce in their 12 April 1982 article that at least five and possibly 15 invaders were killed and 17 were wounded in the invasion. Major Norman, in 2007, confirmed the defending British marines and Royal Navy sailors fired 6,450 small-arms rounds and 12 rockets in the fighting on 2 April 1982. Fearing that British had established an observation post on Tussock Island, Major Mario Castagneto's 601st Commando Company was sent to clear the island of enemy special forces, but returned empty handed and completely covered in black soot due to another Pucara napalm bombing on 1 May.\\"La Compañía de Comandos 601 era usada para las más variadas actividades. Por la mañana, y dado que se creía que desde allí se dirigía a los bombarderos, se habían dirigido a la isla Tussac, a la que le dieron el nombre de Isla Quemada porque un avión había arrojado una bomba de napalm sobre ella y regresaron negros de hollín de la turba que pisaron.\\" Compilación Malvinas, Joaquín A Boccazzi, Page 138, Gráfica Sur, 2004 Nevertheless, several Falkland Islanders maintain the belief that the napalm attacks were part of a cover-up to hide the Argentine losses suffered during the initial fighting codenamed Rosario.\\"God knows what this is doing to the wildlife out there. It is said, although it is difficult to find evidence to support it, that the Argentine dead still being recovered from the invasion, and the deaths from exposure, are being put on the islands so that no trace remains of their losses, which during the invasion period were far heavier than admitted.\\" 74 Days: An Islander's Diary of the Falklands Occupation, John Smith, Page 84, Century, 1984 After the surrender, the Royal Marines and two rifle sections under Corporals Gerald Cheek and Pat Peck from the FIDF were then herded onto the playing fields. Pictures and film were taken of the British prisoners arranged face-down on the ground. This was probably an attempt to demonstrate the lack of British casualties, but it backfired: The images galvanised the British public when they were broadcast on television and increased public opposition to the invasion. Corporal Armour's section had fought on the second floor at Government House and was taken prisoner: \\"There were three casualties lying in the garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood are they going to be in when their oppos are shot up? When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done.\\"Michael Bilton, Peter Kosminsky, p. 233, Speaking Out: Untold Stories From The Falklands War, Andre Deutsch, 1989 The Royal Marines had fought with bravery and skill for they had killed one of his best officers—Lieutenant- Commander Giachino, 2IC of the 1st Marine Battalion—Carlos Busser said.\\"The marines had fought with bravery and skill, Busser said.

Soon afterward, the Royal Marines were moved to a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, which would take them to Comodoro Rivadavia, where they were to be picked up by another airliner to Uruguay and on to the United Kingdom. Members of the FIDF were not taken to Argentina along with members of NP 8901; instead they were disarmed and returned to their homes.Bound, pp. 35 ff. The 77 British marines and Royal Navy sailors were treated to a heroes' welcome when they landed on 5 April, at Brize Norton Air Base in Britain and in the press conference that followed, Rex Hunt (in the presence of Majors Noot and Norman) informed the world press that the Port Stanley defenders had killed at least five Argentine soldiers, wounded 17 others and captured three attackers, destroying an armored personnel carrier in the process along with 10 more soldiers inside \\"who never resurfaced\\". In his final report from Port Stanley that was published on 5 April, Kenneth Clarke from the Daily Telegraph confirmed the tribute that the Argentine Marine Corps commander had paid to the Royal Marine defenders and denied that he and the other British journalists had been subjected to intimidation, as reported by one British newspaper. Corporal York's section remained at large. On 4 April, they reached Long Island Farm owned by a Mrs Watson. York had no radio, and due to worries about possible civilian deaths, chose to surrender to Argentine forces. They gave their position to the Argentine Army using a local islander's radio, and York subsequently ordered his men to destroy and then bury their weapons.Middlebrook, Martin (1985). Operation Corporate: the Falklands War, 1982. Viking, p. 52. Major Patricio Dowling and a platoon from the 181 military police company platoon were helicoptered forward and after roughly handling Yorke's men and posing for pictures, locked up the Royal Marines men in Stanley Police Station. Yorke's section would then be held in Comodoro Rivadavia along with Lieutenant Keith Mill's 22-man platoon and supporting 13-man British Antarctic Survey detachment under Steve Martin captured in South Georgia.

He won a clear majority as a member of the Liberal Party of Honduras and became president in January 1982. The Liberal victory surprised many who believed the armed forces would interfere in favor of its erstwhile National Party allies. Colonel Gustavo Álvarez Martínez became head of the armed forces. The Reagan administration put heavy pressure on Honduras to assist in U.S. efforts against the Nicaragua's Sandinistas and El Salvador's guerrillas operating in Honduras. A U.S military spokesman neatly summarized the U.S. appraisal of the situation: \\"Honduras is the keystone to our policy down there\\". Suazo and Alvarez accepted U.S. troops on continuous \\"maneuvers\\", the construction and expansion of military bases and facilities, and even U.S. training of Salvadoran troops within Honduras. Honduras provided sanctuary and overt cooperation to the Contra army the United States was developing to attack Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Honduras thus became the active ally of the U.S. military strategy for Nicaragua and El Salvador. The country was described at the time as an aircraft carrier—the \\"USS Honduras\\".

But the two schooners instead sought easier quarry off Cape Canso where five prizes of dubious legality were taken. They also raided Charlottetown settlement without regard to orders to respect Canadian property. The story of their illegal actions reached General Washington who dismissed both ship commanders and returned their prizes to Nova Scotian owners with apologies. On 1 January 1776, Captain John Manley, Continental Army, was appointed Commodore of the Fleet and hoisted his flag in Hancock. She captured two enemy transports on 25 January 1776, fending off an eight-gun British schooner in a brisk engagement while prize crews took the captured ships into Plymouth Harbor.Coggins, 2002, p.25 On 30 January 1776 the 14-gun British Brig Hope, which had sailed from Boston for the express purpose of capturing Hancock, intercepted her off Plymouth. Manley ran Hancock ashore where it became impossible for Hope, with her deeper draft, to draw close aboard. The Americans later refloated Hancock and she later captured several more prizes in joint operations with the squadron by April 1776, when Captain Samuel Tucker relieved Commodore John Manley in command of Hancock. Manley was taken into the Continental Navy to command the Continental frigate Hancock. The schooner Hancock captured two brigs off Boston 7 May 1776. She continued to cruise under Tucker until declared unfit for service late in 1776. She returned to her owner early the following year.

According to the Fulham Society, the name actually is a derivative of 'hill brook common' - which relates to Musgrave Crescent, which is raised much higher than the surrounding land. It is believed that this is artificial and it probably was originally a Bronze Age mound - either a raised piece of ground to defend against attackers, or as a burial mound. When you leave Eel Brook Common from the north side, you go up a steep ramp - up onto Musgrave Crescent. It is within the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservation Area of Parsons Green. History In 1883 and again in 1891 a then amateur local football team, Fulham F.C., played their home games there. The Common usually hosts a circus in early summer - and has three other fairs there every year - including Carters Steam Fair. During World War II, an underground bunker was located under Eel Brook Common; this was to protect residents from the Luftwaffe - especially during the Blitz period - and explains why Eel Brook Common is unusually flat. Illustrator Ralph Steadman lived opposite the Common while in London during the mid-20th century, as marked by a nearby blue plaque. During 2002/2003 Groundwork West London completed a £300,000 make-over of the Common, installing surfaced and fenced sports pitches and revamping the vegetation there. In the year 2008/2009, Chelsea Football Club help create an astroturf pitch which can be used in the community. It was sponsored by Chelsea in association with a sports wear firm and is in the blue of Chelsea Football Club. Many local residents complained to the Council about the colour in a green environment, and so there has been much work to grow varied natural screening. The common can be accessed by many roads - including Effie Road to the north, Musgrave Crescent to the north-east and New King's Road to the south-east. There are two tennis courts and a children's playground primarily aimed at under-6s.

Unleavened breads are generally flat breads; however, not all flat breads are unleavened. Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively. Religious significance Jewish matza eaten on Passover Host and communion wafers made of azymes for celebrating the Eucharist, peculiar to the Catholic Church's Latin Rite (Eastern Rite churches and the Eastern Orthodox use leavened bread). Unleavened breads have symbolic importance in Judaism and Christianity. Jews consume unleavened breads such as matzo during Passover as commanded in Exodus 12:18. Per the Torah, the newly emancipated Israelites had to leave Egypt in such a hurry that they could not so much as spare time for their breads to rise, as such, bread which cannot rise is eaten as a reminder. Canon Law of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church mandates the use of unleavened bread for the Host, and unleavened wafers for the communion of the faithful. The more liturgical Protestant churches tend to follow the Latin Catholic practice, whereas others use either unleavened bread or wafers or ordinary (leavened) bread, depending on the traditions of their particular denomination or local usage. On the other hand, most Eastern Churches explicitly forbid the use of unleavened bread (Greek: azymos artos) for the Eucharist. Eastern Christians associate unleavened bread with the Old Testament and allow only for bread with yeast, as a symbol of the New Covenant in Christ's blood. Indeed, this usage figures as one of the three points of contention that traditionally accounted as causes (along with the issues of Petrine supremacy and the filioque in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) of the Great Schism of 1054 between Eastern and Western churches.

Etymology The word lathi is the Bengali word meaning stick, while khela means a sport or game. Therefore, lathi khela translates as a game of sticks. Instruments The lathi is normally made of the male bamboo and sometimes bound at short intervals with iron rings. A typical lathi measures 6 to 8 feet (2 to 2.4 m). Some, called bari, are shorter and may be wielded like a baton or bludgeon. In the past, sticks could be paired with shields, as can still be seen in nori bari (mock stick-fight) demonstrations. History Stick fighting has an ancient history in South Asia, tracing back to the region's aboriginal inhabitants. Rich farmers and other eminent people hired lathial for security and as a symbol of their power. Duels were used as a way to protect or take land and other possessions. A proverb in some South Asian languages is \\"whoever wields the lathi keeps the cow\\". Zamindars (feudal lords) sent groups of lathial to forcefully collect taxes from villagers. Lathi training was at one time included in the Bratachari system of education.ঈদ উৎসবের নানা রং,সাইমন জাকারিয়া, দৈনিক প্রথম আলো। ঢাকা থেকে প্রকাশের তারিখ: আগস্ট ০২, ২০১৩ Although lathi is practised in Indian and Bangladeshi villages, urbanization has led to its decline as a rural martial art in recent decades. Until 1989, an annual nationwide lathi khela convention was held in Kushtia, Bangladesh, where troupes from all over the country took part. Due to the drop in practitioners and spectators, the convention is now held once every three years. Even in the districts where lathi troupes once flourished, only several now remain. Today, lathi khela is most often seen during festivals and weddings. Matches are held in West Bengal for certain puja rituals, and a similar sport called chamdi is played during Eid in North Bengal. Practice Lathial group performed acts like Baoi Jhak (group fight), Nori Bari (mock fight with sticks), Fala Khela and Dao Khela (mock fight with sharp weapons) and Chhuri dance to music, in the presence of hundreds. These groups may learn the arts of dao khela (knife fighting) and fara khela (sword fighting), both of which are preserved today in the form of mock-fights.

Among them are: # The traditional legend of descent from King Saul. # Hephthalite (White Hun) descent. # Descent from Sakas. # Descent from Pakthas. # Descent from Greek peoples and rajput people Prior to DNA studies, it was generally acknowledged that their origins were obscure,... but to speak the truth, the origin of the Afghans [Pashtuns] is so obscure, that no one, even among the oldest and most clever of the tribe, can give satisfactory information on this point and modern scholars suggest that a single origin of the Pashtuns is unlikely but rather they are a tribal confederation. Bani Israel theory There is a tradition among the Pashtuns of being descended from the exiled lost tribes of Israel. This tradition was referenced in 19th century western scholarship and was also incorporated in the \\"Lost Tribes\\" literature popular at the time (notably George Moore's The Lost Tribes of 1861). Recently (2000s), interest in the topic has been revived by Jerusalem anthropologist Shalva Weil, who was quoted in the popular press to the effect that \\"Taliban may be descended from Jews\\".Taliban may be descended from Jews, The Telegraph, 11 January 2010. The traditions surrounding the Pashtuns being remote descendants of the \\"Lost Tribes of Israel\\" is to be distinguished from the historical Jewish community in eastern Afghanistan or northwest Pakistan which flourished from about the 7th to the early 20th century, but which has essentially disappeared due to emigration to Israel since the 1950s. =Mughal-era historiography= According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Maghzan-e-Afghani, a history compiled for Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 16th century. The Maghzan-e-Afghani's Bani Israel theory has been discounted by modern authorities, due to numerous historical and linguistic inconsistencies. In his universal history Mirat-ul-Alam - The Mirror of the World - Bukhtawar Khan describes the journeys of the Pashtuns from the Holy Land to Ghor, Ghazni, and Kabul. Similarly, Rahmat bin Shah Alam, in his Khulasat-ul-Ansab and Fareed- ud-Din Ahmad in Risala-i-Ansab-i-Afghana provide the history of the Afghans and deal with their genealogies. Two of the most famous historical works on the subject are Tarikh-i-Afghana - History of the Afghans - by Nimat Allah al- Harawi, which was translated by Bernard Dorn in 1829, and Tarikh-i-Hafiz Rahmatkhani, by Muhammad Zadeek which he wrote in 1770. \\"Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmat khani\\"was later translated and provided with footnotes by Khan Roshan khan. These books deal with the early history of the Pashtuns, their origin and wanderings in general. They particularly discuss the Yusefzai (literally \\"sons of Joseph\\") and their occupation of Kabul, Bajoor, Swat, Peshawar and some of Charsadda (District of Peshawar). In his Travels into Bokhara, which he published in 1835, Sir Alexander Burnes wrote: \\"The Afghans call themselves Bani Israel, or the children of Israel, but consider the term Yahoodi, or Jew, to be one of reproach. They say that Nebuchadnezzar, after the overthrow of Israel, transplanted them into the towns of Ghore near Bamean and that they were called after their Chief Afghan they say that they lived as Israelites till Khalid summoned them in the first century of the Muhammadans. Having precisely stated the traditions and history of the Afghans I see no good reason for discrediting them… the Afghans look like Jews and the younger brother marries the widow of the elder. The Afghans entertain strong prejudices against the Jewish nation, which would at least show that they have no desire to claim - without just cause - a descent from them.\\" (Sir Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara, Vol. 2:139-141.) Burnes was again in 1837 sent as the first British Envoy to the Court of Kabul. For some time he was the guest of King Dost Mohammad Khan. He questioned the King about the descent of the Pashtuns from the Israelites. The King replied that \\"his people had no doubt of that, though they repudiated the idea of being Jews\\". William Moorcroft traveled during 1819 to 1825 through various countries adjoining India, including Afghanistan. \\"The Khaibarees,\\" he says, \\"are tall and have a singularly Jewish cast of features.\\" (Moorcroft, Travels in Himalayan Provinces of Hindustan and the Punjab; in Ladakh and Kashmir, in Peshawar, Kabul, Kunduz and Bokhara, 12) In his book, An Historical and Descriptive Account of Persia and Afghanistan, which he published in 1843, J. B. Frazer says: \\"According to their own tradition they believe themselves to be descendants from the Hebrews… they preserved the purity of their religion until they met with Islam.\\" (J.B. Frazer, A Historical and Descriptive Account of Persia and Afghanistan, 298) Sir Henry Yule (1902 Encyclopædia Britannica, article on Afghanistan) references the tradition: : This story is repeated in great and varying detail in sundry books by afghans, the oldest of which appears to be of the 16th century; nor do we know that any trace of the legend is found of older date. In the version gives by Major Raverty (Introd. To Afghan Grammar), Afghana is settled by King Solomon himself in the Sulimani mountains; there is nothing about Nebuchadnezzar or Ghur. The historian Firishta says he had read that the Pashtuns were descended from Copts of the race of Pharoah. And one of the Afghan histories, quoted by Mr. Bellew, relates \\"a current tradition\\" that previous to the time of Kais, Bilo the father of the Biluchis, Uzbak (evidently the father of the Uzbegs), and Afghana were considered as brethren. As Mahommed Uzbeg Khan, the eponymus of the medley of Tartar tribes called Uzbegs, reigned in the 14th century A.D., this gives some possible light on the value of these so-called traditions. Thomas Ledlie wrote in an article in the Calcutta Review in 1989 that \\"the Afghans [...] claim themselves to be of Bani Israel.\\" Thomas Ledlie, More Ledlian, Calcutta Review, January, 1898 =Lost Tribes= It should first be noted that Jewish tradition holds that the tribes were not 'lost', but intermingled. The idea entire tribes - such as the Tribe of Joseph - became separated from the main body is not in accordance with that tradition. It is, however, established historical fact that the early Jewish diaspora was widespread, particularly along the Silk Road, and that sizeable groups migrated, assimilated, and eventually, in some cases, took the local religion. Additionally, the presence of an early Jewish community in the area is well attested, and indeed the community survived to the modern day. It is therefore not unlikely that there is a community descended from early Jewish migrants, but difficult to plausibly call them a 'lost tribe'. Joseph-Pierre Ferrier wrote his History of the Afghans in 1858 (translated by Capt. W. M. Jesse). Ferrier wrote that \\"When Nadir Shah Afshar marching to the conquest of India arrived at Peshawar, the chief of the tribe of Yoosoof Zyes (Sons of Joseph) presented him with a Bible written in Hebrew and several other articles that had been used in their ancient worship and which they had preserved...This fact, supposing it to be one, if affording evidence sufficiently convincing to some persons, can only be considered as authority with respect to the Yoosoofzyes ; but it does not follow, therefore, that other Afghan tribes are branches from the same stem ; on the contrary, everything leads to the conclusion that, although they all speak a common language, the Pushtoo, the tribes are not all of the same origin - they are distinguished by marked characteristics, moral as well as physical.\\" George Moore published his work The Lost Tribes in 1861. He argued that these tribes are traceable to India. After giving details of the character of the wandering Israelites, he said: \\"And we find that the very natural character of Israel reappear in all its life and reality in countries where people call themselves Bani Israel and universally claim to be the descendants of the Lost Tribes. The nomenclature of their tribes and districts, both in ancient Geography, and at the present day, confirms this universal natural tradition. Lastly, we have the route of the Israelites from Media to Afghanistan and India marked by a series of intermediate stations bearing the names of several of the tribes and clearly indicating the stages of their long and arduous journey.\\" [George Moore, The Lost Tribes] Moore goes on to say: \\"Sir William Jones, Sir John Malcolm and the missing Chamberlain, after full investigation, were of the opinion that the Ten Tribes migrated to India, Tibet, and Cashemire [Kashmir] through Afghanistan.\\" [George Moore, The Lost Tribes] Major H. W. Bellew went on a political mission to Kandahar and published his impressions in his Journal of a Mission to Kandahar, 1857-8. He then wrote in 1879 his book Afghanistan and Afghans. In 1880 he was sent, once again on another mission to Kabul, and in the same year he delivered two lectures before the United Services Institute at Simla: \\"A New Afghan Question\\", or \\"Are the Afghans Israelites?\\" and \\"Who are the Afghans?\\" He then published another book: The Races of Afghanistan. Finally he collected all his facts in An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, which was published in 1891. In this work he mentions Killa Yahoodi (\\"Fort of the Jews\\") (H.W. Bellew, An Enquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, 34), as being the name of the eastern boundary of their country, and also speaks of Dasht-i-Yahoodi (\\"Jewish plain\\") (ibid., 4), a place in Mardan District. He concludes: \\"The Afghan’s accounts of Jacob and Esau, of Moses and the Exodus, of the Wars of the Israelites with the Amalekites and conquest of Palestine, of the Ark of the Covenant and of the election of Saul to the Kingdom, etc., etc., are clearly founded on the Biblical records, and clearly indicate a knowledge of the Old Testament, which if it does not prove the presence of the Christians at least corroborates their assertion that the Afghans were readers of the Pentateuch.\\" (Ibid., 191) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, wrote a book titled Jesus in India (1899) where he argued that Afghans, Pashtuns and Pathans are descendants from the Tribes of Israel. He by giving resources says that Kish had five sons, one of whom was Irmia Jeremia, from whom Afghana had descended . The \\"Lost Tribes\\" tradition has left some traces in the self-perception of both some Pashtuns and of some Jews well into the 20th century, and until the present day.Weil, S. 1995 \\"Brothers? The Mystery of The Ten Lost Tribes\\", in: Masa Acher 52, November, 16-21. (Hebrew). Thus, Itzhak Ben-Zvi, the second President of Israel, in his 1957 book The Exiled and the Redeemed, writes that Hebrew migrations into Afghanistan began: \\"with a sprinkling of exiles from Samaria who had been transplanted there by Shalmaneser, King of Assyria (719 BC) [...] The Afghan tribes, among whom the Jews have lived for generations, are Moslems who retain to this day their amazing tradition about their descent from the Ten Tribes. It is an ancient tradition, and one not without some historical plausibility... if the Afghan tribes persistently adhere to the tradition that they were once Hebrews and in course of time embraced Islam, and there is not an alternative tradition also existent among them, they are certainly Jewish.\\" (p. 176) In the 2000s, the \\"lost tribes\\" hypothesis was popularized by Shalva Weil, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Shalva Weil, \\"Our Brethren the Taliban?\\", The Jerusalem Report, 22 October 2001, 22. Taliban may have origin in ancient tribe of Israel: Anthropologist finds many similarities - October 2001 In 2010, The Observer under the title \\"Pashtun clue to lost tribes of Israel\\" claimed that \\"Some leading Israeli anthropologists believe that, of all the many groups in the world who claim a connection to the 10 lost tribes, the Pashtuns, or Pathans, have the most compelling case\\" and on a planned study on the ancestry of the Afridi Pashtuns (while noting that \\"A previous genetic study in the same area did not provide proof one way or the other\\"), also citing Weil as saying \\"Of all the groups, there is more convincing evidence about the Pathans than anybody else, but the Pathans are the ones who would reject Israel most ferociously. That is the sweet irony\\".Rory McCarthy, Pashtun clue to lost tribes of Israel The Observer, 17 January 2010. In his book Abraham's Children, Jon Entine, an American TV News producer and author excludes this possibility.Abraham's children: race, identity, and the DNA of the chosen people Jon Entine Greek and Rajput theory The British physician and authority on oriental languages, Henry Walter Bellew, accredited for writing the first Pushtu dictionary in colonial India, suggested that the Pashtuns (Pathans) are actually a mixture of the Greek and Rajput peoples. Swatis and Afridis, By T. H. Holdich, The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 29, No. 1/2 (1899), pp. 2-9 (retrieved 4 May 2007). Bellew’s theory was that all Pashtun tribal names could be traced to Greek and Rajput names, which posits the further possibility of a great Greek mixing with the ancient border tribes of India. In addition, the renowned Arab historian Masudi wrote that Kandahar, the city in which most Pashtuns were concentrated at the time, \\"is a country of Rajputs\\" and was a separate kingdom with a non-Muslim ruler. In the battle between Prithviraj Chauhan and Muhammad of Ghor in 1192 A.D., the historian Firishta stated that \\"Hindu Afghans were fighting on the side of the Rajput Chief\\". Hephthalite (White Hun) descent The early ancestors of modern-day Pashtun tribes could possibly be ancient Iranian tribes that spread throughout the eastern Iranian plateau. According to Yu. V. Gankovsky, the Pashtun's probably began as a \\"union of largely East-Iranian tribes which became the initial ethnic stratum of the Pashtun ethnogenesis, dates from the middle of the first millennium CE and is connected with the dissolution of the Epthalites (White Huns) confederacy.\\" He proposes Ephthalite origin for Pashtuns.Kurbanov pp238-243 According to several scholars such as V. Minorsky, Ghilzais, the second largest Pashtun tribe, is the admixture of Afghan tribes (descendants of Epthalites) and Khalaj people. https://web.archive.org/web/20110613145756/http://www.khyber.org/articles/2005/TheKhalajWestoftheOxus.shtml  See also  * Genetics and archaeogenetics of Asia * Dashti Yahudi * Nimat Allah al-Harawi Author of Tarikh-i-Khan Jahani Makhzan-i-Afghani * Bani Israel * British Israelism * Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory * Theory of Kashmiri descent from lost tribes of Israel  References External links *Alden Oreck, The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Afghanistan from Jewish Virtual Library *Bani-Israelite Theory of Paktoons Ethnic Origin on the site of World Afghan Jirgah.

Alkane conformers are one of the subjects of alkane stereochemistry. Conformation of alkane Alkane conformers arise from rotation around sp3 hybridised carbon carbon sigma bonds. The smallest alkane with such a chemical bond, ethane, exists as an infinite number of conformations with respect to rotation around the C–C bond. Two of these are recognised as energy minimum (staggered conformation) and energy maximum (eclipsed conformation) forms. The existence of specific conformations is due to hindered rotation around sigma bonds, although a role for hyperconjugation is proposed by a competing theory. The importance of energy minimum and energy maximum is seen by extension of these concepts to more complex molecules for which stable conformations may be predicted as minimum energy forms. The determination of stable conformations has also played a large role in the establishment of the concept of asymmetric induction and the ability to predict the stereochemistry of reactions controlled by steric effects. In the example of staggered ethane in Newman projection, a hydrogen atom on one carbon atom has a 60° torsional angle or torsion angle Gold Book Link with respect to the nearest hydrogen atom on the other carbon so that steric hindrance is minimised. The staggered conformation is more stable by 12.5 kJ/mol than the eclipsed conformation, which is the energy maximum for ethane. In the eclipsed conformation the torsional angle is minimised. staggered conformation left, eclipsed conformation right in Newman projection 150px 150px In butane, the two staggered conformations are no longer equivalent and represent two distinct conformers:the anti-conformation (left-most, below) and the gauche conformation (right-most, below). anti vs gauche conformations 150px150px150px Both conformations are free of torsional strain, but, in the gauche conformation, the two methyl groups are in closer proximity than the sum of their van der Waals radii. The interaction between the two methyl groups is repulsive (van der Waals strain), and an energy barrier results. A measure of the potential energy stored in butane conformers with greater steric hindrance than the 'anti'-conformer ground state is given by these values:Organic Chemistry 6e, McMurray, J.E., Brooks Cole (2003) * Gauche, conformer – 3.8 kJ/mol * Eclipsed H and CH3 – 16 kJ/mol * Eclipsed CH3 and CH3 – 19 kJ/mol. The eclipsed methyl groups exert a greater steric strain because of their greater electron density compared to lone hydrogen atoms. Relative energies of conformations of butane with respect to rotation of the central C-C bond. The textbook explanation for the existence of the energy maximum for an eclipsed conformation in ethane is steric hindrance, but, with a C-C bond length of 154 pm and a Van der Waals radius for hydrogen of 120 pm, the hydrogen atoms in ethane are never in each other's way. The question of whether steric hindrance is responsible for the eclipsed energy maximum is a topic of debate to this day. One alternative to the steric hindrance explanation is based on hyperconjugation as analyzed within the Natural Bond Orbital framework.Hyperconjugation not steric repulsion leads to the staggered structure of ethane. Pophristic, V. & Goodman, L.

Weinhold, F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42, 4188–4194 (2003) In the staggered conformation, one C-H sigma bonding orbital donates electron density to the antibonding orbital of the other C-H bond. The energetic stabilization of this effect is maximized when the two orbitals have maximal overlap, occurring in the staggered conformation. There is no overlap in the eclipsed conformation, leading to a disfavored energy maximum.

Special cases In n-pentane, the terminal methyl groups experience additional pentane interference.

The north face rises over above the barren plains. The mountain is the source of the Paro Chu (Paro river) which flows from the south side and the Amo Chu which flows from the north side. Religious significance The mountain is sacred to Tibetan Buddhists who believe it is the abode of one of the Five Tsheringma Sisters;Lopon Kunzang Thinley, 2008. p. 200 (jo mo tshe ring mched lnga) — female protector goddesses (Jomo) of Tibet and Bhutan, who were bound under oath by Padmasambhava to protect the land, the Buddhist faith and the local people. On the Bhutanese side is a Jomolhari Temple, toward the south side of the mountain about a half-day's journey from the army outpost between Thangthangkha and Jangothang at an altitude of 4150 meters. Religious practitioners and pilgrims visiting Mt. Jomolhari stay at this temple. There are several other sacred sites near Jomolhari Temple, including meditation caves of Milarepa and Gyalwa Lorepa. Within an hour's walk up from the temple at an altitude of c. 4450 meters is Tseringma Lhatso, the \\"spirit lake\\" of Tsheringma.Lopon Kunzang Thinley, 2008. pp. 200-202 In Tibet there is an annual pilgrimage from Pagri to a holy lake, Jomo Lharang, which lies at c. elevation, just north of the mountain. Climbing history Because Jomolhari was sacred and the home of goddesses, those living nearby believed it was impossible to climb, and that anyone who climbed too high would be thrown down.Chapman, pp 200-201 Despite its notability and spectacular visibility from the old trade route between India and Lhasa that passes through the Chumbi Valley,Chapman, Map showing Author's route for his ascent of Chomolhari the mountain has seen little climbing activity. It was known to climbers passing by on the way to Everest and was scouted by Odell as early as 1924. In 1937 a permission to climb the sacred mountain was granted to a British expedition headed by Freddie Spencer Chapman by both \\"the Tibetans\\" and the \\"Maharajah of Bhutan.Chapman, page 214 Although no refusals are known of earlier climbing requests, Chapman believed this was the reason it had gone unclimbed until 1937. Six porters accompanied the 5 man climbing team from Phari across Sur LaSur La is approximately 4 miles southwest of Chomolhari summit, and 11 miles northeast of Tremo La Chapman, Map showing Author's route for his ascent of Chomolhari into Bhutan. Chapman, page 222, 226 Chapman and Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama (of the American K2 expedition fame) reached the summit via the southeast spur on 21 May 1937. The protracted and epic descent, which they were fortunate to survive, is described in detail in Chapman’s Helvellyn to Himalaya published in 1940. Mount Chomolhari (Jomolhari) from the road Paro - Chelela Pass, Bhutan The second ascent was only on 24 April 1970 -over the same route- by a joint Bhutanese-Indian military expedition led by Colonel Narendra Kumar. This ascent was notable also for the disappearance of two climbing members and a sherpa in the second summit party the following day. Dorjee Lhatoo (Nanda Devi East 1975, West 1981) led the route, partnered with Prem Chand (2nd ascent Kanchenjunga 1977) all the way to the summit via two camps. Lhatoo was charged with laying a \\"Sachu Bumter\\" offering on the summit by the Bhutanese King in order to \\"appease\\" mountain deities - apparently a pot containing gold, silver and precious stones. The following day, the second party of three were spotted close to the ridge when they became obscured by cloud. When the cloud lifted, they were gone. A telephoto lens and fruit cans were found on the ridge by a search party. Prem Chand went up to the ridge and reported gunshots thudding into the ice and whipping up ice chips - thus ending any further attempts in locating the missing bodies. Lhatoo and Prem Chand, on their way up during their successful summit attempt had reported seeing a lot of PLA activity on the Lhasa-Chumbi highway. The reason for their disappearance remains speculative - did they fall or were they shot? All three were relatively inexperienced climbers and Lhatoo later speculated on the exposure on the knife-edged ridge leading to the summit slope as a possible incident site. He (an ex-Gurkha himself) is quoted as believing the shooting theory to be unlikely but possible, citing his difficulty in estimating the distance between the ridge and possible Chinese positions on the Tibetan side. An account of the expedition is available in the Himalayan Journal 2000.The Himalayan Journal, Vol. 56, 2000. Expeditions and Notes - Ascent of Chomolhari by Dorjee Lhatoo pp. 149-154. -An account of the second ascent of the mountain from Bhutan in 1970, by a joint Bhutanese- Indian expedition Prem Chand has not spoken publicly on the matter. Chinese displeasure with Bhutan over the expedition and sensitivities in New Delhi led to a complete media blackout of what was otherwise a notable Indian climb. The third ascent was made in 1996 by a joint Japanese-Chinese expedition which reached the south col from the Tibetan side and climbed the peak over the south ridge. On 7 May 2004, British climbers Julie-Ann Clyma and Roger Payne reached the summit via the c. 5800 m south col as well, in a single day's dash from the col, after attempts to climb the impressive northwest pillar were thwarted by strong winds. In October 2006, a six-member Slovenian team climbed two new routes, registering the fifth and sixth ascents. Rok Blagus, Tine Cuder, Samo Krmelj and Matej Kladnik took the left couloir of the north face to the East ridge at c. 7100 m, from which they followed the ridge to the top, while Marko Prezelj and Boris Lorencic climbed the northwest ridge in a six- day round trip. This climb earned Prezelj and Lorencic the Piolet d'Or in January 2007.

His music was inspired by Mykola Lysenko and the Ukrainian National Music School. Leontovych specialised in a cappella choral music, ranging from original compositions, to church music, to elaborate arrangements of folk music. Leontovych was born and raised in the Podolia province of the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). He was educated as a priest in the Kamianets- Podilskyi Theological Seminary and later furthered his musical education at the Saint Petersburg Court Capella and private lessons with Boleslav Yavorsky. With the independence of the Ukrainian state in the 1917 revolution, Leontovych moved to Kyiv where he worked at the Kyiv Conservatory and the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama. He is recognised for composing Shchedryk in 1904 (which premiered in 1916), known to the English-speaking world as Carol of the Bells or Ring, Christmas Bells. He is known as a martyr in the Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian Church, where he is also remembered for his liturgy, the first liturgy composed in the vernacular, specifically in the modern Ukrainian language. He was assassinated by a Soviet agent in 1921. During his lifetime, Leontovych's compositions and arrangements became popular with professional and amateur groups alike across the Ukrainian region of the Russian Empire. Performances of his works in western Europe and North America earned him the nickname \\"the Ukrainian Bach\\" in France. Apart from his very popular Shchedryk, Leontovych's music is performed primarily in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora. BiographyEarly life and education= Mykola Leontovych was born on in the Monastyrok community, near the village of Selevyntsi, in the Podolia province of Ukraine (then a part of the Russian Empire). His father, grandfather, and great grandfather were village priests. His father, Dmytro Feofanovych Leontovych, was skilled at singing and playing cello, double bass, harmonium, violin, and guitar, in addition to directing a school choir. Leontovych received his first musical lessons from him. His mother, Mariya Yosypivna Leontovych, was also a singer.Monthly Newsletter of the Tylchyn Centralized Library System Other members of Leontovych's family also grew up to have careers in music. His younger brother became a professional singer, his sister Mariya studied singing in Odesa, his sister Olena studied fortepiano at the Kyiv Conservatory, and his sister Victoriya also knew how to play several musical instruments. In the summer of 1879, Mykola Leontovych was moved to a new parish located in the village of Shershni in suburbs of Bar, Ukraine in Bar's district, where he would spend his childhood. Then, in 1887, Leontovych was admitted to Nemyriv gymnasium. Due to financial problems a year later, however, his father transferred him to the Sharhorod Spiritual Beginners School, whose pupils received full financial support. At the school, Leontovych mastered singing, and was able to freely read difficult passages from religious choral texts. =Theological seminary= 260x260px In 1892, Leontovych began his studies at the theological seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi, which both his father and grandfather had attended. His younger brother Oleksandr was enrolled as well, graduating two years after Mykola. During his studies there, Leontovych continued to advance his skills on the violin and learnt to play a variety of other instruments. He also participated in the seminary's choir, and when an orchestra was formed during his third year of study, Leontovych joined, playing the violin until his graduation. Leontovych studied music theory and started writing choral arrangements as a student at the seminary. When the seminary's choir director died, the school administration requested that Leontovych take over this position. As the conductor of the choir, Leontovych added secular music to the repertoire of traditional church music. This included Ukrainian folk songs arranged by Mykola Lysenko, Porfyriy Demutskiy, and himself. Leontovych graduated from the Kamianets-Podilskiy Theological Seminary in 1899 and broke the family tradition by becoming a music teacher instead of a priest. =Early musical career and family= 345x345px At the time, a career in music in Ukraine meant having an unstable income, causing Leontovych to seek employment wherever he could find it.РЕКВІЄМ ПО ЛЕОНТОВИЧУ (Requiem about Leontovych) Article by Olga Melnyk on the 18–31 December 2008 edition of the Ukrainian Gazette. Discusses \\"тривожні часи\\" (rough times) and poverty that Leontovych and others had to live through during that time. Leontovych worked in Kyiv, Yekaterinoslav, and Podolia guberniyas over the next few years in order to remain gainfully employed. His first position after graduating was in a secondary school in the village of Chukiv (present-day Vinnytsia Oblast) as a vocal and maths teacher. During this time, Leontovych continued to transcribe and arrange folk songs. He completed his First Compilation of Songs from Podolia and began working on his second compilation. He also inspired the children at the school to sing in the choir and play in the orchestra. He would later write a book about this as a professor at the Kyiv Conservatory, titled Як я організував оркестр у сільській школі (How I Organised an Orchestra in a Village School). After several conflicts with the school's administration, Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the Theological College in Tyvriv. Besides working with the college choir, Leontovych organised an amateur orchestra that often performed at college events. As he did earlier with choirs, Leontovych included arrangements of folk songs among the usual religious works sung in theological schools. These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko, his own choral arrangements of folk songs, and entirely original works. One such work was based on a poem by Taras Shevchenko titled Зоре моя вечірняя (Oh My Evening Star). During this period, Leontovych met a Volynhian girl named Claudia Feropontivna Zhovtevych, whom he married on 22 March 1902. The young couple's first daughter, Halyna, was born in 1903. They later had a second daughter named Yevheniya. 257x257px Financial hardships prompted Leontovych to accept an offer to move to the city of Vinnytsia to instruct at the Church-Educators' College. Again, he organised a choir and, later, a concert band, with which he performed both secular and spiritual music. In 1903, he published his Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia which he dedicated to Mykola Lysenko. In 1903 and 1904, during his vacation from the Church-Educators' College, Leontovych travelled to St. Petersburg. There, he attended lectures held at the St. Petersburg Court Capella, which was associated with composers Maksym Berezovsky, Dmytro Bortniansky, and Mikhail Glinka. He studied music theory, harmony, and polyphony with Semen Barmotin, and choral performance with Puzarevskiy, both of whom were well known at the time. On 22 April 1904, he earnt his credentials as a choirmaster of church choruses. 304x304px Again, disputes with the administration of the college resulted in Leontovych's seeking new employment. In the spring of 1904, he left Podolia and moved to the Donbas province in eastern Ukraine, where he became a teacher of vocal and instrumental music in a school for railroad workers' children. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Leontovych organised a choir of workers that performed in meetings. These works included arrangements of Ukrainian, Jewish, Armenian, Russian, and Polish folk songs. Leontovych's activity caught the attention of local authorities, and in the spring of 1908, he was forced to move back to his native Podolia province to the city of Tulchyn. = Tulchyn period = Leontovych's move to Tulchyn marked the beginning of a period of compositional maturity and major artistic achievements in the life of the composer. In Tulchyn, Leontovych taught vocal and instrumental music at the Tulchyn Eparchy Women's College to the daughters of village priests. There, he met composer Kyrylo Stetsenko who was a student of Mykola Lysenko and also specialised in choral music. Stetsenko lived in a nearby village at the time where he was working as a priest, and their acquaintance developed into a lasting friendship that influenced Leontovych's music. Stetsenko was the first critic of Leontovych's music, saying, \\"Leontovych is a famous music expert from Podolia. He recorded many folk songs... These songs are harmonised for mixed choir. These harmonisations have revealed the author to be a great expert of both choral singing and theoretical studies\\". Leontovych also transitioned to more renowned music during his choir performances, such as Russian composers Mikhail Glinka, Alexey Verstovsky, and Peter Tchaikovsky in addition to Ukrainian composers Mykola Lysenko, Kyrylo Stetsenko, and Petro Nishchynskyi. From 1909, he studied under musical theoretic Boleslav Yavorsky, whom he periodically visited in Moscow and Kyiv over the next twelve years. Leontovych also became involved with theatrical music in Tulchyn and its community life by taking charge of a local organisation called Prosvita, meaning \\"enlightenment\\". This period in his career was among the most productive, as he created numerous choral arrangements. These included his famous Shchedryk, as well as Піють півні (The Roosters are Singing), ' (A Mother had One Daughter), ' (Little Dudka Player), ' (Oh, the Star has Risen), amongst others. In 1914, Stetsenko convinced Leontovych to have his music performed by the student choir of the Kyiv University under the leadership of Alexander Koshetz. On 26 December 1916, the performance of his arrangement of Shchedryk brought Leontovych great success from the public in Kyiv and raised the interest of intellectuals. =Career in Kyiv= During the October Revolution and the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1918, Leontovych relocated without his family to Ukraine's capital Kyiv, where he was active as both a conductor and composer. Several of his pieces gained popularity among professional and amateurs groups alike, who added them to their repertoire. In the beginning of 1919, the rest of his family also relocated to Kyiv. During this period, Leontovych also began teaching choir conducting alongside Hryhoriy Veryovka at the Kyiv Conservatory, and also taught at the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama. Leontovych was one of the organisers of the first Ukrainian State Orchestra. He participated in the founding of the Ukrainian Republic Capella of which he was the commissioner.

Published 25 May 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2011 Fleeing persecution, Leontovych returned to Tulchyn with his family. There, he started the city's first music school, since the college where he had worked was closed down by the Bolsheviks. He also began to work on his first major symphonic work, the opera ' (On the water nymph's Great Day). During the night of 22–23 January 1921, Mykola Leontovych was murdered by Chekist (Soviet state security) agent Afanasy Grishchenko. Leontovych was staying at the home of his parents, whom he was visiting for the Orthodox Feast of the Nativity (25 December in the Julian calendar, which, in the Gregorian calendar, adopted by the USSR only in 1918, falls in January). The undercover Chekist had also asked to stay the night at the house and shared a room with Mykola. At dawn he shot the composer (who died of blood loss a few hours later) after robbing his family.Вбивця стріляв у сплячого композитора (The killer was shooting at the sleeping composer) – article from the newspaper 20 Minutes Several facts point to a political motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents to leave the country for Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along with the fact that he was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death. Character Mykola Leontovych was highly critical of himself. According to his first biographer Oles' Chapkivskyi, a contemporary of the composer, Leontovych would sometimes work on one choral setting without letting anyone else see it for up to four years. After the publication of his Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia, he changed his mind and was not fully satisfied with it, and as a result he bought all 300 copies and had them destroyed. Chapkivskyi also described Leontоvych as having a shy personality, saying \\"He abstained from fame, feared attention\\"боявся галасу\\", боявся=he feared, галасу=of -noise, -clamor, -commotion, -hustle and bustle. In other words he did not want all of the attention that came with fame and advertisement.\\" On the other hand, Chapkivskyi claimed that Leontovych's jealousy, fear of competition, and fear of non-acceptance from the established musical society, caused the music of Leontovych to be little known. Zynoviy Yaropud of the Kamianets-Podilskyi State Pedagogical University writes that \\"all of [Leontovych's] contemporaries called him a quiet, gentle person. He was not an active leader of the national-revolutionary movement, which revealed in the years of 1917–1921 a whole handful of prominent fighters for the Ukrainian republic,\\"translated text: \\"всі його сучасники називали тихою, лагідною людиною. Він не був активним лідером національно-революційного руху, який вияскравив у 1917–1921 роки ціле гроно видатних борців за Українську республіку\\" revealing that the composer was politically quiet, but not indifferent. Leontovych's friend, O. Buzhanskiy, recalls that the composer was \\"always full of humour; spoke so that everyone was laughing to tears, but he remained serious and stayed calm.\\" Stetsenko also described Leontovych to be a \\"witty storyteller\\" and that his students at the Church Educator's School in Tulchyn were \\"in love with him\\" because of his storytelling.«Щедрик» Леонтовича лунає по всьому світу (Leontovych's \\"Shchedryk\\" echoes through the entire world Article published 20 January 2011 in Halychyna Gazette =Religious views= Mykola Leontovych grew up in a highly religious environment. He was a member of the Orthodox Church, descended from a line of village priests. He was also a graduate of the Podollia Theological Seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi, which, for the most part, trained Orthodox Christian clergy. As a person with a professional theological education, Leontovych kept up with the movement of the establishment and recognition of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which was reestablished in 1918. The composer's output during this period became rich in new sacred music, following the examples of Kyrylo Stetsenko (a close friend of Leontovych's, also an orthodox priest and composer) and Alexander Koshetz. Leontovych's works form this time included ' (On the Resurrection of Christ), ' (Praise ye the Name of the Lord), and ' (Oh Quiet Light), among others. A milestone in the development of Ukrainian spiritual music was the composition of his liturgy, which was first performed in the Mykolaiv Cathedral at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra on 22 May 1919.  Commemoration  Leontovych featured on a Ukrainian postal stamp On 1 February 1921, nine days after Leontovych's death, a large number of artists, professors, and students of the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama in Kyiv gathered to commemorate him, as is expected according to Christian tradition. They established the Committee for the Memory of Mykola Leontovych, which later became the All-Ukrainian Mykola Leontovych Music Society, and promoted Ukrainian music until 1928. Ukrainian writer and politician of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Pavlo Tychyna, was an admirer of Leontovych and wrote about the composer's death in prose. Poets Maksym Rylskyi and Mykola Bazhan also dedicated poetry to him. The name of Leontovych is carried by musical groups, such as the Leontovych Bandurist Capella, and by educational institutions such as the Vinnytsia College of Arts and Culture. Streets in Kyiv and other cities have been named after him. There is a memorial museum dedicated to him in the city of Tulchyn, and another was established in 1977 in the village of Markivka where he was buried.Музей Леонтовича (Museum of Leontovych) description of Leontovych Museum in the village of Markivka In 2002, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the composer's birth, the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi held an all-Ukrainian scientific conference entitled \\"Mykola Leontovych and Modern Education and Science,\\" with guests from the Ukrainian ministry of education and science, the Ukrainian composers' Union, and many local authorities. During this event, the city held a ceremonial opening of a memorial plaque to the composer, placed next to the old building formerly used by the Podollia Theological Seminary. Music Mykola Leontovych specialised in a cappella choral music. He is remembered today mostly through the musical works he left behind, which include over 150 choral compositions. These range from artistic arrangements of folk songs, religious works (including his liturgy), cantatas, and choral compositions set to the words of various Ukrainian poets. His two most famous works are the choral miniatures Schedryk and Dudaryk. Leontovych also commenced work on an opera (Na rusalchyn velykden’ – On the Water Nymph's Easter) based on Ukrainian myths and the works of Borys Hrinchenko. By the end of 1920, he had finished the first of three acts. However, Leontovych was murdered before he could complete the opera. Attempts to complete and edit the opera were made by Ukrainian composer Mykhailo Verykivsky.115 років від дня народження М.І.Вериківського (1896–1962)... (115 years since the day of birth of M.I.Verykivsky...) biography of Verekivsky Composer Myroslav Skoryk and poet Diodor Bobyr used the musical material of the unfinished opera to make a one- act operetta; this premiered in 1977 at the Kyiv State Opera and Ballet Theatre, one hundred years after Leontovych's birth. The North American premiere took place in Toronto on 11 April 2003. One of the largest influences in Mykola Leontovych's music is that of Mykola Lysenko, who is considered \\"the father of Ukrainian classical music\\".The music of Mykola Lysenko Duma Music, Inc. Preview of Taras Filenko and Tamara Bulat's The World of Mykola Lysenko: Ethnic Identity, Music, and Politics in Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century with this reference. Leontovych admired Lysenko's music ever since he was a student at the Kamianets-Podilskyi Theological Seminary, when he had the seminary's choir perform the composer's music. Since then, he would perform Lysenko's music in concerts wherever he worked. =Shchedryk/Carol of the Bells= motif of the song by which listeners automatically recognize it. Mykola Leontovych's Shchedryk is his most well-known piece. In its English version as a Christmas carol, it is known as the holiday favourite Carol of the Bells.Mykola Dmytrovich Leontovych About/Bio – ClassicalArchives.com It is famous for its four-note ostinato motif and has been arranged over 150 times since 2004. The original Ukrainian text of Shchedryk used hemiola, a shifting of accents within each measure between 6/8 and 3/4, which is lost in the English versions. The most popular English adaptation was composed in 1936 by Peter J Wilhousky who was influenced by the culture of his Eastern European parents and the traditional Christian story of carols ringing out at the birth of Jesus, although other English adaptations of the song were also made in 1947 by M. L. Holman, 1957, and 1972. The song has been used many times in the soundtracks for films and television. For example, it was used in the box office hits The Santa ClauseThe Santa Clause (1994) – Soundtracks imdb.com and Home Alone,Home Alone (1990) – Soundtracks imdb.com Will Vinton's award- winning A Claymation Christmas Celebration,A Claymatin Christmas (1987) (TV) – Soundtracks imdb.com and as a parody called Carol of the Meows in The O.C.'s episode The Chrismukkah That Almost Wasn't\\". A modernised version of Carol of the Bells was played in The Office. It has also been arranged and performed by many groups, regardless of singing style or genre, ranging from classical (Vienna Boys Choir),CD Universe Track listing of Vienna Boy's Choir Album Christmas Greetings From The Vienna Boys Choir to traditional music groups (Celtic Woman),iTunes Track listing Celtic Woman's Album Holidays & Hits: Christmas Celebration / The Greatest Journey to pop singers and groups (Jessica SimpsoniTunes Track listing of Jessica Simpson's 2010 Album Happy Christmas and Destiny's ChildiTunes Track Listing of Destiny's Child's Album 8 Days of Christmas). = Musical style = Leontovych had an original style. Many of his works have \\"deft use of imitative counterpoint\\" and impressionistic harmony.\\" He had a strong desire for his music to arouse the senses, especially sight, saying, \\"I'm interested in which colours you used for high tones, and which for the low ones. I myself often think about that, to combine sound and colour.\\"translated text: \\"Мене цікавить, які кольори ви використали для високих тонів, а які для низьких. Я сам часто думаю над тим, щоб поєднати звук і колір.\\" His choral compositions feature rich harmony, vocal polyphony, and imitation. His earlier choral arrangements of folk songs were primarily strophic arrangements of the melody. As the composer gained more experience, the structure of his choral compositions and arrangements of folk songs became more frequently intertwined with text. Leontovych arranged many Ukrainian folk songs, creating artistically independent choral compositions based on their melodies and lyrics. He followed the traditions of improvisation of Ukrainian kobzars, who would interpret every new strophe differently. He also employed humming and the variability in timbre of singers' voices as techniques in reaching a desired emotional or sensual effect.Леонтович Микола Дмитрович - 100 видатних українців (Leontovych Mykola Dmytrovych - 100 famous Ukrainians Dictionary entry on Leontovych from \\"100 famous Ukrainians\\" Accessed 2 August 2011 A central topic of Leontovych's work is choral music about everyday life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An example of this is his shchedrivka Ой там за горою (Oh there behind the Mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo and the rest of the voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve. = Reception and popularity = For most of his career, Leontovych kept his music to himself, only performing it during his own concerts. This was because of the composer's highly self-critical and shy personality. Leontovych's first critic was his friend and fellow priest and composer Kyrylo Stetsenko, who described him to be \\"a great expert of both choral singing and theoretical studies\\". He also convinced Leontovych to publish his music and have it performed by the Kyiv University. The successful debut of \\"Shchedryk\\" earnt Leontovych popularity among specialists and fans of choral music in Kyiv. Leontovych's mentor-turned-coworker at the Kyiv Conservatory, Boleslav Yavorsky, also positively evaluated his newly written works. During another concert, Leontovych's Lehenda, set to a poem by Mykola Voronyi, gained great popularity.Леонтович Микола Дмитрович (1877–1921) композитор, хоровий диригент, громадський діяч, педагог Article analyzing the music of Mykola Leontovych After reviewing Leontovych's Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia, Lysenko wrote: \\"Leontovych has an original, illustrious gift. In his arrangements I found separate passages, movement of voices, which later developed in a geniously weaved musical network.\\"translated text: \\"Леонтович має оригінальний, яскравий дар. Я знайшов у цих обробках самостійні ходи, рух голосів, які потім розвивалися в геніально сплетену музичну мережку\\" The increase in popularity of Leontovych's music was aided by the head of the Ukrainian National Republic, Symon Petliura, who created and sponsored two choirs that would promote the awareness of and the culture of Ukraine.Ukrainian Republican Kapelle Encyclopedia of Ukraine article by Wasyl Wytwycky One choir headed by Kyrylo Stetsenko toured across Ukraine, while the Ukrainian Republic Capella headed by Alexander Koshetz toured Europe and the Americas.Kyrylo stetsenko – His Life Article by Wasyl Sydorenko on Musica Leopolis Performances by the Ukrainian Republic Capella made Leontovych known throughout the western world. In France, Leontovych earned the nickname, \\"Ukrainian Bach\\". On 5 October 1921, the Capella performed Shchedryk in the Carnegie Hall in New York City. In 1936, ethnically Ukrainian Peter J. Wilhousky, who worked for Radio NBC, wrote his own lyrics for the song, which became known as the Carol of the Bells. Apart from Shchedryk, or the Carol of the Bells, Leontovych's music is currently performed mostly in Ukraine and few recordings are dedicated exclusively to him. The Ukrainian diaspora remember him and perform his works. For example, the Olexander Koshetz Choir based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, performs music of Ukrainian composers including Leontovych and have made a recording of his music.CDs/Cassettes CD's and cassettes sold the O.

He wrote under the pen name \\"K.R.\\", initials of his given name and family name, Konstantin Romanov. Early life The fourth child of the Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia and his wife Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg, KR was born in the Constantine Palace, Saint Petersburg. His eldest sister Grand Duchess Olga married King George I of the Hellenes in 1867. From his early childhood KR was more interested in letters, art, and music than in the military upbringing required for Romanov boys. Nevertheless, the Grand Duke was sent to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. KR was unsatisfied, and left the navy to join the elite Izmailovsky Regiment of the Imperial Guard, where he served with distinction. Public life Konstantin Konstantinovich as Joseph of Arimathea in his own play Tsar of Judea, 1914 Six children of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich Nadezhda Plevitskaya — \\"Unhappy died at the military hospital\\". Words — K.R. (Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia). Music — Jacob Prigogine (1909). KR was both a patron of Russian art and an artist in his own right. A talented pianist, the Grand Duke was Chairman of the Russian Musical Society, and counted Tchaikovsky among his closest friends. But KR was first and foremost a man of letters. He founded several Russian literary societies. He translated foreign works (including Schiller and Goethe) into Russian, and was particularly proud of his Russian translation of Hamlet. An accomplished poet and playwright, KR also took great interest in the direction of his plays. The Grand Duke actually appeared in his last play, \\"King of Judea,\\" playing the role of Joseph of Arimathea. The Grand Duke's artistic slavophilism and devotion to duty endeared him to both Alexander III and Nicholas II. The former appointed KR as President of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and later as Chief of All Military Colleges. He was also made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1902, with reference to his chairmanship of a Swedish-Russian surveying commission. KR and his wife were among the relatively few Romanovs on intimate terms with Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra, who found KR's devotion to his family a welcome respite from the playboy lifestyle of many of the other Grand Dukes. He was also a close friend of the Grand Duchess Elizabeth and wrote a poem about her expressing his admiration when she first came to Russia to be married. He was also one of the few members of the Imperial Family to go to Moscow to attend the funeral of Elizabeth's husband, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, who was killed by a terrorist's bomb. Sexuality Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia as Mozart, 1880. As exemplary and dedicated (and even conservative) as KR's public life was, his private turmoil was intense. Had it not been for the publication of KR's strikingly candid diaries long after his death, the world would have never known that this most prolific of Grand Dukes, the father of nine children, was tormented by his homosexual feelings.Maylunas, Andrei, and Mironenko, Sergei, editors; Galy, Darya, translator, A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra: Their Own Story, 1997 As mentioned, KR's first homosexual experiences occurred in the Imperial Guards. The Grand Duke made great efforts to repress his feelings. But despite his love for his wife, KR could not resist the temptations offered to a person of his exalted state. KR claimed in his diary that between 1893 and 1899 he remained away from the practice of what he called his \\"main sin.\\" Yet by the birth of his seventh child, KR had become a steady visitor to several of the male brothels of St. Petersburg. In 1904 he wrote in his diary that he \\"ordered my coachman...to go, and continued on foot past the bath-house. I intended to walk straight on... But without reaching the Pevchesky Bridge, I turned back and went in. And so I have surrendered again, without much struggle, to my depraved inclinations.\\" The cycle of resistance and capitulation to temptation is a common theme of KR's diaries. By the end of 1904, KR became somewhat attached to an attractive young man by the name of Yatsko. \\"I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth.\\" A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two. In KR's final years, he wrote of his homosexual urges less and less, whether from having reached some arrangement with his conscience, or from the natural advance of age and ill health. Marriage and family Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth and their children. KR married in 1884 in St Petersburg Princess Elisabeth of Saxe- Altenburg, his second cousin. Upon her marriage, Elisabeth became the Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna. She was known within the family as \\"Mavra.\\" KR was, by all accounts, devoted to his wife and children, and a loving father. He and his family made their home at Pavlovsk, a suburban palace of St. Petersburg, and a favorite residence of KR's great-grandfather, the Emperor Paul I. The couple would have a total of nine children: *Prince John (1886–1918) *Prince Gabriel (1887–1955) *Princess Tatiana (1890–1979) *Prince Konstantin (1891–1918) *Prince Oleg (1892–1914) *Prince Igor (1894–1918) *Prince Georgy (1903–1938) *Princess Natalia (died at exactly two months, 1905) *Princess Vera (1906–2001) Prince John married Princess Helen of Serbia (daughter of King Peter of Serbia) in 1911. Princess Tatiana married Prince Konstantin Bagration-Muhransky, a Georgian prince, that same year. KR's children were the first to fall under the new Family Law promulgated by Emperor Alexander III. It stated that henceforth, only the children and male- line grandchildren of a Tsar would be styled Grand Duke or Grand Duchess with the style of Imperial Highness -- great-grandchildren and their descendants would be styled either \\"Prince of Russia\\" or \\"Princess of Russia\\" with the style of Highness. The revised Family Law was intended to cut down on the number of persons entitled to salaries from the Imperial treasury. War years and death The outbreak of World War I found KR and his wife in Germany, where they were taking the cure in Wildungen. Caught in enemy territory, the couple attempted a quick return to Russia. Their plans were disrupted by German authorities, who claimed the Grand Duke and his wife were political prisoners. Grand Duchess Elizaveta sent a message to the German Imperial couple asking for their help. Eventually KR and his entourage were allowed to depart Germany and transported to the first Russian station. The weakened KR had to proceed by foot across the front lines. By the time K.R. and Elizaveta arrived in St. Petersburg, now renamed Petrograd, the Grand Duke was in a dismal state of health. The first year of the war took a cruel toll on his immediate family. Five of his six sons served in the Russian Army, and in October 1914, his fourth and most talented son,Zeepvat, Charlotte, The Camera and the Tsars, 2006 Prince Oleg, was mortally wounded fighting against the Germans. The following March, his son-in-law Prince Bagration-Muhransky was killed on the Caucasus front. KR's health and spirit were broken by these blows, and he died on 15 June 1915. Fate of KR family after the Russian Revolution Mine shaft in Alapaevsk where remains of three of KR's sons were found The Princes Ioann, Gavriil, Konstantin, and Igor were all arrested after the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917. Prince Gavriil was kept in Petrograd due to illness, but the other three princes were deported to Alapaevsk, a small town in the Urals. There they were imprisoned for some months, together with the Grand Duchess Elizaveta Feodorovna, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich, and Prince Vladimir Paley. On the night of 17–18 July 1918 (24 hours after the execution of Nicholas II and his immediate family in Ekaterinburg), the Alapaevsk prisoners were slaughtered by their Bolshevik captors. Their bodies were recovered from an abandoned mine shaft by the White Army, and reburied in the Church of the Martyrs near Beijing, China. Prince Gavriil was released from prison through the intercession of Maxim Gorki, who had unsuccessfully tried to save several other Romanovs. Gavriil and his wife (whom he had married after the Revolution) emigrated and settled in Paris, where Gavriil died in 1955. The widowed Princess Tatiana fled to Romania and later to Switzerland with her children. She eventually became a nun, and died in Jerusalem in 1979, where she had been Abbess of the Orthodox Mount of Olives Convent. KR's wife and two youngest children, Prince George and Princess Vera, remained at Pavlovsk throughout the war, the chaotic rule of the Provisional Government, and after the October Revolution. In the fall of 1918, they were permitted by the Bolsheviks to be taken by ship to Sweden (on the Ångermanland, via Tallinn to Helsinki and via Mariehamn to Stockholm), at the invitation of the Swedish queen. At Stockholm harbor they met prince Gustaf Adolf who took them to the royal palace. Elizaveta Mavrikievna and Vera and Georgi lived for the next two years in Sweden, first in Stockholm then in Saltsjöbaden; but Sweden was too expensive for them so they moved first to Belgium by invitation of Albert I of Belgium, and then to Germany, settling in Altenburg where they lived 30 years, except for a couple of years in England. Elizaveta died of cancer on 24 March 1927 in Leipzig. Prince Georgi died in New York City in 1938. Princess Vera lived in Germany until Soviet forces occupied the east part of the country, she fled to Hamburg and in 1951 she moved to United States and died there in 2001,\\"Vera Constantinovna, Russian Princess, Dies at 94.\\" New York Times, January 20, 2001 in Nyack, New York. As of 2005, KR has at least ten living descendants: the three children of Princess Ekaterina (daughter of KR's son Prince Ioann) and her seven grandchildren. One of them is American actor Sebastian Arcelus.

The CTP nominated its leader, Mehmet Ali Talat, who emerged as the clear winner with a 56% share of the vote. The notable absence in this election was the first and at that point only president of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş. He had announced in mid-2004 that he would not be running again. Electoral system A candidate needed an absolute majority of valid votes in order to win in the first round of voting. If no candidate secured the necessary majority, a second round of voting would have been held between the two top candidates. Campaign The election campaign began on 22 March and eded the day before the elections. Under rules set out by the High Electoral Committee, public opinion polls were not allowed be published or broadcast after 2 April. Opinion polls A poll had been conducted between 23 and 27 March 2005 by the Cyprus Social Research and Education Consultancy Centre (KADEM). It found that Mehmet Ali Talat would win an absolute majority in the first round. The poll of 1472 people across Northern Cyprus put the results as follows: * Mehmet Ali Talat - 54.9% * Derviş Eroğlu - 26.8% * Mustafa Arabacıoğlu - 8.9% * Hüseyin Angolemli - 2.5% * Nuri Çevikel - 1.2% * Zeki Beşiktepeli - 1.5% * Ayhan Kaymak - 0.6% * Arif Salih Kırdağ - 0.4% * Zehra Cengiz - 0.2% 54% of those polled said the election would be finalised in the first round, while 41% said a second round of voting would be required. Results The Turkish Cypriot electoral commission put the turnout at 69.58%, a lower figure than previous presidential elections, which have always been over 80%. It led UBP leader Derviş Eroğlu to question the legitimacy of the elections, pointing to the fact that so many voters had decided not to vote in protest.

Biography Van Dorp was born as the son of Hendrik van Dorp and Maria van Dorp, and studied chemistry in Amsterdam where he received a PhD for his thesis Aneurine en gistphosphatase in 1941. In 1946, while employed by the Dutch company Organon in Oss, Van Dorp and Jozef Ferdinand Arens ('Coco') (1914-2001) published the synthesis for vitamin A acid in the scientific journal Nature. In 1947, they completed the first full synthesis for the complex compound vitamin A, by taking the final step and turning the acid in an alcohol. Their synthesis was not to be used for commercial production, as an alternative route that was published soon after by Otto Isler (1910-1992) and co-workers (Hoffmann-La Roche) turned out to be much more suited for upscaling. Van Dorp joined the Unilever Research Laboratory in Vlaardingen in 1959, and was a key person in the studies regarding the role of arachidonic acid in the metabolic pathway to prostaglandin E2, in close cooperation with Sune K. Bergström who would later receive a Nobel prize for his work on prostaglandins. In 1973 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. References *J.F.

The school was built in 1918 and served as K-12 school until 1960, when it was merged with the Poudre School District. It was closed in 1992 and was used as a youth center by the school district until 2004 Waverly is a small unincorporated community in rural eastern Larimer County, Colorado, United States. It is primarily an agricultural community, consisting of a group of houses along County Road 15 surrounded by ranchlands north of Fort Collins and west of Wellington. The only public buildings in town are a fire station of the Wellington Fire District, as well as the Waverly School, a former schoolhouse. The community has gained local notoriety in recent years because of recent subdivision growth along County Road 15, as well as by efforts of local citizens to manage growth and repel possible annexation attempts. History The town and vicinity in 1906 The area around the community was settled in the 1880s, with ranching and sugar beet cultivation as the primary industries. In 1903, the town was platted by F.C. Grable and promoted by his brother Sherman. It was named \\"Waverly\\" after the Walter Scott novels by a post clerk in the early 20th century. Most of the platted development did not occur, however, and the town remained very small in size. In the early 20th century, it was incorporated for a time as the Town of Waverly and governed by a board of trustees. At its height, the town had several stores, a church, and post office, as well as the school, built in 1918. The girls basketball team won state championships in 1939 and 1940. In 1960, the school district was consolidated with the larger nearby Poudre School District, and the school became an elementary school. The elementary school was closed in 1992, and for the next 12 years, the building was used as a teen program center by the school district. In 2004, the school district moved the programs to Fort Collins and the building was sold to a private non- profit organization. Most recently, the building serves as an alternative teen learning center by Turning Point, the meeting place for the Ridin' for the Brand Cowboy Church, and occasionally as a community hall. The Waverly community today consists of rural homes and ranches located around County Road 15. In the 1990s, the rapid growth of Fort Collins and Wellington began to encroach on the area with the development of several upscale ranchette subdivisions along County Road 15, as well as growth spreading from nearby Wellington. The new development prompted community efforts to manage growth. In 2001, the Waverly Community Group was formed in response to a proposal by Fort Collins to build a highway bypass south of Waverly. In 2002, the group effectively lobbied the Board of Trustees of the Town of Wellington to adjust its growth plan to avoid the eventual annexation of Waverly. In 2004, the group was designated as the managers of an \\"area of concern\\" by the Larimer County Board of Trustees, who would be notified and consulted regarded any county ordinances or growth plans in the area. Geography The Waverly community in general is bounded as follows: on the north by County Road 72, on the east by County Road 11, on the west by County Road 21, and on the south by County Road 64. Culture Waverly continues to enjoy a mix of interlocking agricultural activities and cottage industries that contribute to its uniqueness. The people of Waverly in general are involved with the land and livestock and are invested in keeping the open, agrarian, rural character of their community intact.

It was first published in 1975 by Jonathan Cape and re-issued in 1997 by Vintage.  Context  The collection is McEwan's first published work and was regarded by the author (along with his second collection of short stories, In Between the Sheets) as an opportunity to experiment and find his voice as a writer. In an interview with Christopher Ricks in 1979, McEwan commented, \\"They were a kind of laboratory for me. They allowed me to try out different things, to discover myself as a writer.\\" As a piece of work that portrays McEwan, the writer, at his youngest, it is perhaps fitting that the dominant theme is that of adolescence, of the blurry and perilous divide between childhood and adulthood; in addition themes of sex, perversion, and the grotesque in its many forms feature throughout. Stories The book is composed of eight short stories, with the title story coming seventh: *\\"Last Day of Summer\\" is an eerily haunting story of a twelve-year-old boy who, having lost his own mother, finds another mother figure in Jenny, a large woman who comes to stay with him. On one of their many journeys in his rowing boat on the Thames, however, Jenny and the baby Alice drown and die. The event is described hauntingly by McEwan \\"Jenny is big and my boat is small...it goes over quickly like a camera shutter\\" and we hear no moral judgement, no remorse, just the narrator \\"hanging on to the green shell with nothing in my mind.\\" The significance seems all the more heavy because of this, Kiernan Ryan believing it to in fact suggest a \\"matricidal fantasy.\\" *\\"Homemade\\", the second story in the collection, is an unsettling tale of a self-satisfied teenager, confident in his ability to outperform his friend in every 'adult' discipline: drinking, smoking, etc., until he realises he is still a virgin. The protagonist then sets out to have sex with his ten-year-old sister, whom he does not find in the least attractive (\\"you could almost pass her off as plain\\"), under the grotesque pretence of playing 'Mummies and Daddies\\". We get the impression that the narrator wants to lose the shameful tag of virginity above everything else, and is desperate to assert his masculinity on something, anything. This criticism of male thinking is best summed up in the narrator's thoughts as he \\"felt proud, proud to be fucking, even if it were only Connie, my ten-year-old sister, even if it had been a crippled mountain goat...\\" *\\"Butterflies\\" again sails close to the wind of obscenity, being told through the eyes of a socially isolated man who is not remarkable in any positive way. On one of his walks into his town's decaying underbelly, he meets a young girl and walks with her. On arrival at a deserted dry canal, he demands that she touch his penis, and after this sordid encounter, drowns her. Perhaps most harrowing is the way the protagonist describes the murder, \\"My mind was clear, my body was relaxed and I was thinking of nothing... I ... eased her quietly into the canal.\\" Again morality is completely detached and the reader is made to squirm at the lack of remorse or even feeling shown. *\\"Solid Geometry\\" takes a narrator who shuns his wife, Maisie (who seems desperate to elicit some affection from him) in favour of reading his great-grandfather's eventful diary. Ryan sees the diary as a 'symbol of patriarchal heritage,\\" and it is fitting that it should provide the means for the protagonist to dispose of his wife once and for all. He reads a section in which his great-grandfather sees a scientist contort his body in a way that makes him disappear inside himself, and applies this to his wife. The murder is disturbingly clean, just as is the case with many of McEwan's atrocities, \\"As I drew her arms and legs through, Maisie appeared to turn in on herself like a sock.... all that remained was the echo of her question above the deep-blue sheets.\\" *\\"Conversation with a Cupboard Man\\" takes the form of a confessional by a man who was treated as a baby by his mother until the age of seventeen, when he was thrown out due to his mother remarrying and forced to fend for himself. The narrator is torn between knowing how wrong his mother's actions were \\"I could hardly move without her, and she loved it, the bitch\\" and still yearning for them \\"I don't want to be free.\\" *\\"Cocker at the Theatre\\" is the shortest story. It is an account of some acting couples who simulate sex, only to be interrupted by a couple who are having sex for real. *\\"First Love, Last Rites\\" the title story tells the tale of a narrator and his teenage lover, Sissel, who enjoy a long summer of love making. As well as acknowledging the immense gratification he gains from satisfying his most base instincts \\"sperms... inches from my cock's end... the unstoppable chemistry of a creature growing out of dark red slime\\" the narrator details the temptation he and his lover have of wallowing in animalistic decadence. This is personified by a giant pregnant rat whose presence is felt more and more, until it bursts out from its den and attacks. The narrator bludgeons it to death and realises the significance of it when he sees \\"a translucent purple bag, and inside five pale crouching shapes\\" i.e., the baby rats. Again a female has been killed and the reader must determine the relevance themselves. *\\"Disguises\\" involves a boy, Henry, taken under the wing of his eccentric aunt, who puts Henry in elaborate costumes for their evening meals. Things turn strange when Henry is faced with a costume consisting of a girl's wig and frock. The odd pressure on his sexuality is released when he falls in love with Linda, and McEwan seems to dissolve the boy's masculinity by having him revel in the girl's dress \\"invisible inside this girl.\\" The ending is far from conclusive and we do not learn what becomes of Henry. It has been suggested by any critics that as well as adolescence, the stories revolve around the difficulty of becoming a 'man,' whatever society deems a man to be. McEwan has described adolescents as \\"the perfect strangers,\\" and through his use of first person narratives in this collection focuses on that difficult and often shocking transitional period. Awards First Love, Last Rites received the Somerset Maugham Award for 1976; coincidentally, McEwan's friend Martin Amis\\"Martin Amis and friends,\\" The Daily Beast, 16 February 2009Ian McEwan, \\"Martin Amis is Not A Racist,\\" The Guardian, 21 November 2007. (McEwan: \\"I've known Martin Amis for almost 35 years.\\") had been the previous author to receive the honour. Reception The collection was well received by critics. In the Dictionary of Literary Biography, John Fletcher wrote, \\"Such writing would be merely sensational if it were not, like Kafka's, pointed, so accurate, so incapable indeed of being appalled. In contemporary writing one has to turn to French literature to encounter a similar contrast between the elegance of the language and the disturbing quality of the material; in writing in English McEwan is wholly unique.\\"Dictionary of LIterary Biography, Detroit, MI: Gale, 1983. Volume 14, British Novelists since 1960, pps 495–500. Critic Robert Towers described McEwan's England in The New York Review of Books as a \\"flat, rubble-strewn wasteland, populated by freaks and monsters, most of them articulate enough to tell their own stories with mesmerizing narrative power and an unfaltering instinct for the perfect, sickening detail\\"; Towers called the collection \\"possibly the most brilliantly perverse and sinister batch of short stories to come out of England since Angus Wilson's The Wrong Set.\\"Robert Towers, \\"In Extremis,\\" The New York Review of Books, 8 March 1979. In The New York Times, Michael Mewshaw stated that \\"even the most measured plot synopsis may make these stories sound sensational or slightly psychopathic [...] But what sounds lurid and macabre in summary comes across on the page as poignant and often appealing. This is a tribute to Ian McEwan, a young British writer who has an extraordinary talent for humanizing potentially unpalatable characters.\\" While Mewshaw argued that central characters in \\"Homemade\\" and \\"Conversation with a Cupboard Man\\" were literary and sophisticated to an extent that was incompatible with their situations, Mewshaw also wrote that the stories “indicate at once that [McEwan] is a writer of wit, imagination and incisiveness.” An unfavorable write-up appeared in Kirkus Reviews, however, where the reviewer complained, \\"There are no elements of fine drawn invention and surprise here--only too literally does he manage to soil his hands. [...] Provocation of a sort, but is it really justified by such an overwhelming fetor?\\" David Malcolm stated in 2002 that \\"Cocker at the Theatre\\" is \\"perhaps the weakest of the stories\\" but referred to the others as \\"rather detailed and painstaking evocations of mood and feeling, of desire, shame, uncertainty, distaste, and confusion.\\" Lucas Wittmann of The Daily Beast listed the collection in 2010 as one of McEwan's stronger pre-Atonement works along with his other short story collection, arguing, \\"In all of these stories lie the essence of McEwan’s fictional vision, and for any fan of his work this is the place to start to understand how he has evolved as a writer even while he’s never quite given up on finding humanity and dark humor in our collective foibles.\\" Conversely, Sandra Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail that McEwan had evolved as an artist since his early works and that First Love, Last Rites is among the books in which the author is a \\"literary shocker\\" rather than an \\"innovative and compassionate novelist\\", likening it to punk rock. Film adaptations The title story was adapted for a 1997 film of the same name. The film stars Natasha Gregson Wagner as Sissel and Giovanni Ribisi as Joey. It was directed by Jesse Peretz. \\"Butterflies\\" has been adapted twice for cinema. In 1988 by Wolfgang Becker under the German title Schmetterlinge and in 2005 by Max Jacoby under its original English title. \\"Solid Geometry\\" was also adapted by Channel 4 in 2002 into a short film of the same name. This adaptation was directed by Denis Lawson and stars Ewan McGregor as Phil and Ruth Millar as Maisie.

Parsons Green is a relatively small triangle of former common land in the Parsons Green area of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. It is named after the rectors of the parish of Fulham whose residence once adjoined this patch of land and subsequently the name was adopted for the district. From the late 17th-century onwards, the area surrounding the green became the focus for fine houses and grounds built by merchants and the gentry within easy distance of London, yet in a more salubrious setting than the urban environs. A number of Georgian houses have survived, some of them replacing earlier Tudor and Elizabethan buildings.

He was Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 2008 to 2011. He stepped down after the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, in which the Liberal Democrats were reduced to five seats, down from 16 in the previous parliament. Background, education and early career Scott was born on 6 May 1966 in Inverness, Scotland, he attended Anderson High School, Lerwick, Shetland and holds a BA (Hons) Business Studies from Napier College in Edinburgh. After graduating, he worked as a parliamentary assistant to Jim Wallace, then Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, and later as a Press Officer for the Scottish Liberal Democrats. He then returned to Shetland and became a farmer and also a councillor on Shetland Islands Council and Chairman of the Lerwick Harbour Trust. He is married with three children. Member of the Scottish Parliament Scott was elected the first Member of the Scottish Parliament for Shetland in May 1999. He was also the first parliamentarian for the Shetland Islands as a distinct entity; up to that point there had only been a single UK parliamentary constituency for both Orkney and Shetland. He served as a Deputy Minister for Parliament in the Scottish Executive from 2000 to 2001 in succession to his colleague Iain Smith, but resigned after refusing to support the Executive in a vote in the Parliament on a tie-up scheme for fishing. In 2003, he returned to the Scottish Executive as Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services. During his time there his department piloted the Local Governance (Scotland) Act, which changed the elections for local authorities in Scotland to a proportional representation system. Following Nicol Stephen's election as party leader and succession as Deputy First Minister of Scotland in 2005, Scott was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Transport. He was re-elected with an increased majority in May 2007, and held the largest margin by percentage, 50.1%, of any MSP over their closest challenger. After the resignation of his friend and former ministerial colleague Nicol Stephen, Scott declared his candidacy for the leadership of the Scottish Liberal Democrats on 7 July 2008 at Lerwick harbour, surrounded by a group of men dressed as Vikings which is a tradition in Shetland called Up Helly Aa where Shetlanders celebrate their Viking heritage.Shetland News, 7 July 2008 On 26 August 2008, he was announced the winner of the leadership contest with 59% (1,450) of the votes. Following what he described as a \\"disastrous\\" set of results for the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the Scottish elections in May 2011, Scott offered his resignation as leader (remaining a Member of the Scottish Parliament). He claimed the poor showings were in part due to the coalition deal which saw the Liberal Democrats form a government with the Conservatives after the 2010 United Kingdom general election. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, Scott was a keen advocate of a \\"No\\" vote as well as recognition that whatever the outcome of the referendum there ought to be a recognition of \\"Northern Isles’ right to determine their own future.\\" At the Liberal Democrat party conference in 2013 put forward a motion with fellow MSP Liam McArthur to recognise the Islands had a \\"separate right to self-determination\\" Scott said that his preferred outcome was for Shetland to become a crown dependency of the UK with its own parliament, and was backed by the cross-party Wir Shetland movement that campaigns for crown dependency status. Scott announced in June 2019 that he would be resigning from the Scottish Parliament to take a position with the Scottish Rugby Union.

It was billed as a cast recording for a proposed musical of the same name, which was ultimately not produced by Zappa, but later performed partially in 2003, ten years after his death. The album's storyline is inspired by Broadway theatre, AIDS, eugenics, conspiracy theories, feminism, homosexuality and African American culture. It involves an evil, racist prince/theater critic who creates a disease intended to eradicate African Americans and homosexuals. The disease is tested on prisoners who are turned into \\"Mammy Nuns\\" led by the story's narrator, Thing-Fish. The story within a story is a satire of a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant couple, Harry and Rhonda (actually played by Italian-Americans), who attend a play performed by the \\"Mammy Nuns\\", and find themselves confronted with their pasts: Harry presented as a homosexual boy, Rhonda presented as a sex doll brought to life. The story was constructed during the recording sessions, which included producing new overdubs for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, You Are What You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. The release of the album was delayed when Barking Pumpkin Records' previous distributor, MCA, refused to distribute the album. It was instead released by Capitol Records in the United States, accompanied by a \\"Warning/Guarantee\\" written by Zappa himself. Thing- Fish was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content.  Background  Before leaving for London to record with the London Symphony Orchestra, Frank Zappa was home during Christmas season in 1982, and kept busy by writing, producing treatments for three films and a Broadway musical called Thing-Fish. Between 1981 and 1982, Broadway theatre had shifted from conservative musicals to experimental plays that were viewed as either being pretentious or vulgar. Thing-Fish satirized statements made by theater critics at the time, as well as arguing against the \\"dumbing down\\" of American culture. Previously, Zappa unsuccessfully attempted to stage two musicals on Broadway, Hunchentoot, which formed the basis for the compact disc reissue of Sleep Dirt, and a musical adaptation of William S. Burroughs' The Naked Lunch. Thing-Fish also drew conceptual themes from AIDS, feminism, gay chic, conspiracy theories and issues of class, greed and race. The script was developed by recording songs beforehand; much of the songs in the play were previously recorded for other albums, including Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, You Are What You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch. New vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new Synclavier music. In addition to the new songs, the previously recorded songs include new overdubs moving this storyline forward. As the recording process continued, Zappa brought in revised scripts and improved the work by editing or changing aspects with which he was dissatisfied. Zappa attempted to produce Thing-Fish as a Broadway production. In promotion of the planned musical, a photo sequence based upon the \\"Briefcase Boogie\\" scene was shot for the pornographic magazine Hustler, accompanied by plot excerpts from the scene. The sequence was 28 pages long. While the album was released, Zappa was unable to raise the $5 million budget in order to produce the play, and shelved the project. Subsequently, Thing-Fish dialogue appeared on the album Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention, during the piece \\"Porn Wars\\". The album was adapted for a limited stage production that took place in England in 2003. Many elaborate details were changed due to the small scale of the production.. Retrieved on December 11, 2007.  Style and influences  Lyrics and story themes = The Thing-Fish characterization was performed by Ike Willis, who helped shape the dialogue himself using African American Vernacular English According to Willis, \\"in my family, we sort of joke around with dialects, and what it sounded like to me was [the poet] Paul Laurence Dunbar. [...] I asked Frank if he had ever heard of this guy, and he said, 'No,' so I started giving him examples of Dunbar's work, and eventually, that ended up being a big influence on the Thing-Fish dialect.\\" Minstrel shows served as a source of satire within the storyline. The Thing-Fish characterization is also seen as satirizing Amos 'n' Andy, a successful radio series and controversial television series which drew protests from the NAACP, who perceived the dialect spoken by the main characters and supporting character Kingfish as being portrayed as being \\"too dumb to speak English.\\" Additionally, Zappa satirized the Mammy archetype; the AIDS-like disease in the storyline turns prisoners into \\"Mammy Nuns\\" which are round and dress like Aunt Jemima. The Mammy archetype derives from the fictional character Mammy, as portrayed by Hattie McDaniel in the film Gone With The Wind. Thing-Fish is delivered as a story within a story, focusing on a spoiled White Anglo-Saxon Protestant couple, Harry and Rhonda, who attend a play that initially begins as being about and starring the Mammy Nuns. The story ultimately ends up following these characters through a series of ideological fads. It is revealed that Harry had become a homosexual as a result of the women's liberation movement, which caused him to lose all sexual desire for women; the younger versions of the characters are portrayed in the characters \\"Harry-As-A-Boy\\" and \\"Artificial Rhonda\\", with the young Rhonda being portrayed as a rubber sex doll, while her older counterpart becomes increasingly fascistic and feminist towards the end of the story. = Music and performance = The concept of Thing-Fish satirized minstrel shows. \\"Mammy Nuns\\" resemble blackface performers. The prologue is delivered as a spoken monologue over an instrumental piece with a heavy rock guitar riff.Prologue  AllMusic It is followed by the song \\"The Mammy Nuns\\", which originated as a hard rock instrumental, which appears in a live recording as \\"The Mammy Anthem\\" on You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1, and opened performances in June and July 1982.The Mammy Nuns  AllMusic \\"Galoot Up-Date\\" is an altered version of the recording \\"The Blue Light\\", which appeared on Zappa's album Tinseltown Rebellion.Galoot Up-Date  AllMusic As Harry and Rhonda express admiration for the \\"performance\\" of the Evil Prince, an early version of Zappa's Synclavier composition \\"Amnerika\\" is heard.That Evil Prince  AllMusic \\"Clowns on Velvet\\" was performed live as a \\"spirited, playful instrumental\\".Clowns on Velvet  AllMusic A recording of the instrumental version featuring guitarist Al Di Meola was planned for release on the album Tinseltown Rebellion, but DiMeola refused its release.

Barking Pumpkin Records prepared to release the album with distribution by MCA Records. MCA produced a test pressing of the triple LP set, but withdrew their distribution after a woman in their quality control department became offended and upset by the album's content. A deal was quickly made with EMI Records, which would allow Them Or Us and Thing-Fish to be distributed by Capitol Records in the United States. Zappa wrote a \\"warning\\" which appeared on the inner sleeves of these albums, as well as Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention, which stated that the albums contained content \\"which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress\\", and a \\"guarantee\\" which stated that the lyrics would not \\"cause eternal torment in the place where the guy with the horns and pointed stick conducts his business.\\" The original vinyl mix of Thing-Fish was only briefly available on CD via a 1987 EMI release in the United Kingdom. All other CD releases contain modifications, edits, re-equalization, and some minor remixing (the most significant difference—Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson's spoken vocals during \\"He's So Gay\\"—was not implemented immediately). This new version was initially released on CD by Rykodisc, and along with most of Zappa's catalogue was reissued in 1995, also by Rykodisc. In 2012, after the Zappa Family Trust had regained the rights to Zappa's catalogue, Zappa Records, along with Universal Music reissued the album (still in revised form) on CD.  Reception  Thing-Fish was poorly received by critics upon initial release; a common thread of criticism was that many of the songs on this album derived from previously released recordings, and some detractors considered it to be nothing more than a compilation album. Barry Miles found it to be one of his \\"least substantive\\" works. More recently the album has been reappraised, described by Kevin Courrier in Dangerous kitchen: the subversive world of Zappa as \\"a compendium of Zappa's most explicit attacks on political and sexual hypocrisy in American culture collected together in one huge volley.\\" In Frank Zappa and musical theatre: ugly ugly o'phan Annie and really deep, intense, thought-provoking Broadway symbolism, Thing-Fish is described as \\"an extraordinary example of bricolage\\". Full article available by free login only. Retrieved on July 28, 2008. As reviewed by François Couture for the website Allmusic, Couture described Thing-Fish as Zappa's \\"most controversial, misunderstood, overlooked album\\", stating that it was not a masterpiece, but \\"more than rehashed material\\".

The 1st Army, however, was to carry out limited offensives to ensure the security of the Italian border, and occupy any enemy territory, wherever this was possible and convenient Cadorna 1921, p. 100. In Cadorna's plan, the 1st Army would defend against any Austrian offensive from Trentino thus protecting (along with the 4th Army) the rear of the bulk of the Italian army which was engaged on the Isonzo Front. With the task of having to stay on the defensive, Brusati was frustrated by (in his opinion) Cadorna's inability to understand that the Austro-Hungarians had retreated on a defensive line well beyond the official border. Thus, Brusati’s 1st Army carried out offensive operations enthusiasticallyThompson, Mark. The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915-1919, Basic Books, 2008, p. 176. Already on May 25, 1915, the day after Italy entered the war, these Italian troops, taking advantage of the fact that the Austro-Hungarian troops were deployed far from the border, conquered terrain of considerable strategic value, such as Monte Altissimo, Coni Zunga and parts of the Val d’Adige and Vallarsa, near Lake GardaCadorna 1921, p. 131. However, starting from August, after the failure of new attacks against the Austro-Hungarian permanent fortifications (on the Vézzena Plateau) that guarded the head of the Val d'Astico (east of the previous successes), General Cadorna directed the 1st Army Command back to the defensive mode. Nevertheless, Brusati did not give up on further operations aimed at consolidating the front, sometimes deploying his troops in an offensive stance. This alignment led to neglecting the defensive preparations with the bulk of the forces available remaining concentrated on the advanced positions, rather than on the rear positions, more suitable for defensive operations. =Operations in 1916= In March 1916, the information services of the ArmyThompson, 2008, p. 175 had the first news of a concentration of Austrian forces in the Trentino sector. These were to be the preparations for the so- called Strafexpedition, planned by the Chief of Staff of the Imperial Royal Austro-Hungarian Army, Field Marshal Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf. This offensive had the intent to defeat the Italian army, unleashing an offensive through the lines of the 1st Army to take the entire Italian Isonzo deployment from the rear. In view of a probable enemy offensive, at his request, Cadorna granted Brusati five further divisionsThompson 2008, p. 176. However, Cadorna remained persuaded that nothing would happen in that sector. Still Brusati’s troops were strung-out after their offensive advances and the state of the defenses was ill-prepared. In disagreement with Cadorna, Brusati deployed the defense at the end of the advanced positionsdegli Azzoni Avogadro, Luciano & Malvasia, Gherardo, L'amico del re. Il diario di guerra inedito di Francesco degli Azzoni Avogadro, aiutante di campo del Re Vol.2 (1916), Udine, Gaspari editore, 2011, p. 49 counting on the solidity of the strengthening work carried out until then. In addition, on April 1, the Army again went on the offensive, launching assaults which achieved some partial successes, but at the cost of the defense. In the second half of April General Cadorna visited the lines of the 1st Army and on that occasion he even refused to meet Brusati because, according to some, he already had plans to dismiss him. On May 8Thompson 2010, p.177 Brusati was relieved from command by Cadornadegli Azzoni Avogadro 2011, p. 58 and replaced by General Guglielmo Pecori Giraldi, eight days before the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive began. General Pecori Giraldi Ultimately the 1st Army along with elements of the newly created Fifth Army prevailed in this major Austro-Hungarian action, helped by the Russian Brusilov Offensive in Galacia which required von Hötzendorf to move troops away from the Italian offensive and to the Eastern Front. In August of 1916, the 1st Army was reorganized and growing, along with the Regio Esercito overall as more draftees reached the war zone. The 1st Army now had six Corps, covering the same frontlines in the Trentino. The III Corps (5th, 6th and 37th Divisions) remained under Gen. Camerana. The V Corps (44th, 47th and 32 Divisions) was added under Lt. General Bertotti; along with the X Corps (9th and 20th Divisions) under Lt. Gen. Grandi; a new Truppe Altipiani commanded by Lt. General Mambretti and consisting of the XII Corps (30th, 29th and 25th Divisions) under Lt. Gen. Zoppi and the XX Corps (13th, 28th and an Alpini Unit) under Lt. General Montuori; and the XVIII Corps (15th Division and 2nd Cavalry) under Lt. Gen. Etna. There was a Corps Troop at Verona consisting of infantry battalions, artillery, bomb units, cavalry and engineer unitsL’Esercito Italiano Nella Grande Guerra (1915-1918), Volume III, Tomo 3, Le Operazioni Del 1916, Stato Maggiore dell’Esercito, Ufficio Storico, 1937, pp. 265-266. For the balance of 1916, this Army engaged in fights and other actions in what became known as the “White War”Warriors of the White War emerge from their frozen tomb: Almost 100 years after losing their lives in ferocious First World War Alpine battle, melting ice reveals the bodies of the fallen, The Daily Mail, London, March 6, 2014. There were attacks on Monte Pasubio (in September and October), Monte Cimone (in September), in Val Sugana (in August and September) and numerous small actions in Val Sugana, Val Posina and Altipiano d’Asagio Operazioni Del 1916, Volume III, Tomo 3, 1937, pp. 267-287. Many soldiers also lost their lives in avalanches. In November 1916 the 1st Army with Cardorna’s consent, had planned “Action K” (Code Name) a small counteroffensive targeting Monte Ortigara using General Mambretti’s Truppe Altipiani as well as the XVIII CorpsPieropan, Gianni, Storia della grande guerra sul fronte italiano, Milano, Mursia, 2009, pp 293-294. This action had tp be cancelled due to heavy snows. The Italian Command would later reprise and augment the plan for June 1917. On December 1, 1916 Mambretti was now placed in charge of a new Sixth Army (Italy) taking his XX Corps as well as the XVIII Corps. Added to these troops were two newly constituted Corps, the XXII and XXVI. =Operations in 1917= As part of a re-organization (after Caporetto) several new Corps were created and assigned (1916-1917) to the 1st Army including the XXIX, V, XXVI, and XXII Corps. At this time the Trentino Front was defended by the III Corps (5th and 6th Divisions and the Brigata Valtellina) from Stevio to Garda; the XXIX Corps (37th and 27th Divisions), V Corps (55th and 69 Divisions), X Corps (32nd and 9th Divisions), three Corps of Truppe Altipiani (XXVI – 12th and 11th Divisions, XXII – 57th and 2nd Divisions and XX – 29th and 52 Divisions) from Garda to SuganaL’Esercito Italiano Nella Grande Guerra (1915-1918), Volume IV, Tomo 3, Le Operazioni Del 1917, Stato Maggiore dell’Esercito, Ufficio Storico, 1967, p. 72. The 1st Army did not take part in any major defensive or counteroffensive battles in 1917. The first Army did, however, defend the Asiago Plateau during the Battle of Caporetto which helped the retreating Italian troops to set up a strong defensive line at the Piave River in NovemberSee Cimpric, Željko with John McDonald, Caporetto and the Isonzo Campaign: The Italian Front, 1915–1918, Pen & Sword, 2011, chapter 21. However, the White War continued in 1917 for the First Army through a series of small actions (between June and October) in the high isolated valleys of the Trentino mountains. The following minor actions were reported)L’Esercito Italiano Nella Grande Guerra (1915-1918), Volume IV, Tomo 2, Le Operazioni Del 1917, Stato Maggiore dell’Esercito, Ufficio Storico, Roma, 1967, pp. 402-409: * Corno di Cavento (Adamello) with the 5th Division, Casina Garioni / Casina Pascon with the X Corps, * Mascio with the III Corps, Vallagarina at Mori and Mt. Giovo with the XXIX Corps, * Val di Ledro (III Corps), Val Posina (V Corps), * Massico dell’Ortler (Arditi), * Val Concei and Dosso Prighen (III Corps), * Val Giudicare (III Corps), * Mt. Altissimo (XXIX Corps) and * Val Camonica (III Corps). =Operations in 1918= Although the 1st Army was part of the re-organization of the Italian Army after Caporetto, the modifications were originally quite minor. In January 1918, the Order of Battle was essentially the same as the October changes except for the addition of the XXV Corps to the Truppe Altipiani under Gen. ZoppiL’Esercito Italiano Nella Grande Guerra (1915-1918), Volume V, Tomo 1, Le Operazioni Del 1918 gennaio da Maggio, Stato Maggiore dell’Esercito, Ufficio Storico, Roma, 1980, pp. 56-57. However, in March, the III Corps and a new Corps, the XIV were transferred to the newly created 7th Army which became responsible for the Stelvio-Garda Sector L’Esercito Italiano, Volume V, Tomo 1, 1980, pp. 203-205. Furthermore the Truppe Altipiani were dispersed to other Italian Armies, including the newly re-constituted 6th Army (which also included the British and French Expeditionary Forces which came to Italy after Caporetto) which took over responsibility for the defenses at Asiago and the re-organized 4th Army which also took over responsibility for the mountain defenses at Mt. Grappa in their western zoneSee Italian Ministry of Defence – History. The 1st Army saw limited action in the mountains between January and May. There were continuous patrols which occasionally led to small firefights and artillery shelling (including aerial bombardments). This Army saw minor action in Mt. Cornone (Altopiano di Asiago), Tre Monti and the Val Lagarina subsector (Conca dei Laghi and Castello Mori), and the Vallarsa (Mt. Corno) L’Esercito Italiano, Volume V, Tomo 1, 1980, pp. 222-224. During the Austrian Offensive in June 1918 (Second Battle of the Piave), the 1st Army (and the 7th Army) was responsible for the defense at the Trentino Front. There were no major offensives or Italian counteroffensives launched in this zone, although the Austro-Hungarians applied some offensive pressure in support of its Operation RadetzkyCavallaro, Gaetano V., Disaster Ending in Final Victory: The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire ..., Volume 3, Xlibris, 2010, p. 73. On June 15, the Italian Division 6 consisting of the Czechoslovakian Legion in Italy was assigned to the 1st ArmyL’Esercito Italiano, Volume V, Tomo 1, 1980,, pp. 323-327. However, after this battle, operations began to pick up beginning in August with the following small battlesL’Esercito Italiano, Volume V, Tomo 1, 1980, pp. 230-240: * Battle of Dosso Alto di Zurez - (Hill 703) – On August 3, north of Monte Altissimo, the XXIX Corps (Arditi) retook this position which the Austrians had held since June 15. * Battle of Monte Majo in Val Posina (left of Mt. Pasubio) – On August 30, the V Corps (Bersaglieri and Arditi) captured Hill 1500 opposite Il Dente di Cane. * Nord Sano – On September 11, Arditi with support from a Czech Regiment took an Austrian post near Mori and captured 12 prisoners. * Dosso Alto and Sasso Sega – On September 21, Czech Legion fought off an attempt by the Austrians to re- capture this position. * Cima Tre Pezzi – On September 24, bersaglieri and Czechs (from X Corps Sector) took a position here, assisted by artillery fire from the British Division of the adjacent Sixth Army. * Vallone di Belassi – Alpini (X Corps) in a counterattack on September 25 captured Austrian positions in Collegio across from Valle Scarabozza. * Pasubio – Col Santo – On September 26, Bersaglieri (V Corps) fought off an Austrian attempt to attack Monte Corno. =The Final Battle= As the final battle (Vittorio Veneto) began at the end of October, the 1st Army (along with the 7th) was to maintain a strictly defensive positionL’Esercito Italiano, Volume V, Tomo 1, 1980, p. 758. However, as the battle progressed and the Austro-Hungarian Army at first retreated, then collapsed into a disorganized retreat, the 1st Army began an offensive thrust towards Rovereto and the city of Trento. On November 2, while the situation of the Austro-Hungarian army became increasingly pessimistic, the Italian Supreme Command also set in motion the troops of the 1st Army of Giraldi. Since the previous night the Xth Army Corps had attacked in Val d'Astico encountering little resistance; consequently Giraldi decided to speed up the operations and his troops immediately advanced in the Tonezza plateau and in the Luserna plateau. The march of the 32nd Division in Vallagarina began in the early afternoon; a unit of Arditi, under the command of Major Gastone Gambara, and three Alpine battalions advanced into the valley and occupied RoveretoSee Pieropan, Gianni, Storia della Grande Guerra sul fronte italiano. 1914-1918, Milano, Mursia, 2009, pp. 831-832 and Cervone, Pier Paolo, Vittorio Veneto, l'ultima battaglia, Milano, Mursia, 1993, p. 226. The advance of the Italian army now became general. On the left bank of the Adige, the Piceno and Liguria brigades marched in Vallarsa and on the Pasubio, in Val Posina. In the Adige valley the disintegration and collapse of the Austro- Hungarians became catastrophic; materials and vehicles were abandoned, the trains heading north were stormed by the soldiers, as panic and lack of discipline spread. Italian troops in Trento on November 3, 1918On the afternoon of November 3, the troops of the 1st Army reached Trento: the first units to enter the city were the cavalry regiment \\"Alessandria\\", the XXIVth Arditi, the Alpini of the IVth group; the infantry of the Pistoia brigade arrived later. The final advance had not met with any real opposition: the Italian soldiers received an enthusiastic welcome from the populationCervone 1993, pp. 226-228. That evening a unit of the \\"Padua\\" cavalry regiment of the 4th Army of General Giardino also arrived in Trento; and on the following afternoon Giraldi himself, commander of the 1st Army, entered Trento, when the Armistice took effect. After the Armistice, the 1st Army became responsible for the occupation to all of Trentino, South Tyrol (both of which became part of Italy) and Austrian Tyrol. On September 20, 1919 the 1st Army Command became the Trento area Command, one of the new designated army commands of the Royal ArmySee Italian Ministry of Defence – History. World War II At the beginning of World War II, the Italian First Army was one of three armies that made up Army Group West commanded by Prince General Umberto di Savoia. Together with the Italian Fourth Army and the Italian Seventh Army (kept in reserve), the First Army attacked French forces during the Italian invasion of France. At this time, the First Army was commanded by General Pietro Pintor and included three army corps: the 2nd Corps commanded by General Francesco Bettini, the 3rd Corps - General , and the 15th Corps commanded by General Gastone Gambara. (See order of battle, below.) By 1942, after the defeat of Panzer Army Africa (Panzerarmee Afrika) at the Second Battle of El Alamein and after the Operation Torch landings, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was forced to make one of the longest retreats in history. He withdrew from the \\"Western Desert\\" of Egypt and Libya and established a defence on the French-built Mareth Line in southern Tunisia. After occupying the Mareth Line, Rommel took command of the newly created Army Group Africa and turned over the \\"German- Italian Panzer Army\\" (formerly \\"Panzer Army Africa\\") to Italian General Giovanni Messe. The army was once again renamed and on February 23, 1943, Messe took command of the \\"Italian First Army.\\" As part of Army Group Africa commanded by General Rommel, the First Army attacked Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army at Operation Capri (the Battle of Medenine, just east of the Mareth Line. The First Army suffered a crushingly defeated and the attempt by Rommel and Arnim to break through in Tunisia failed. By the end of May, Allied troops had captured all of North Africa, and the First Army was the last of the 270,000 Axis troops taken prisoner. =Order of Battle at 10 June 1940=2nd Corps Commanded by General Francesco Bettini * 4th Infantry Division, \\"Livorno\\" (Gen.

In the story, two boys are drawn into an intergalactic adventure when their house is magically hurled through space. The book is a standalone spinoff to the 1981 children's picture book Jumanji, also by Van Allsburg, and visual and textual references are made to Jumanji in the story. The book was adapted into a film, titled Zathura: A Space Adventure, in 2005. Plot Zathura starts from the end of the book Jumanji, as the parents of two brothers, Danny and Walter Budwing, are leaving. The two brothers don't get along with each other. Danny wants to play catch, while Walter wants to watch television. Danny tosses Walter a baseball which hits him on the head. Walter then chases Danny through the house and catches him in the park across the street from their house, where they find a board game named Jumanji. Danny brings the game home, where he then loses interest in playing it. Underneath the Jumanji board, Danny finds another game called Zathura: A Space Adventure. Danny starts playing Zathura, then he gets a card that says, \\"Meteor shower, take evasive action.\\" Immediately, a meteor shower occurs. Danny and Walter soon realize the game sent them into outer space. The brothers start playing the game Zathura, since the game won't take them home unless they finish it. Soon, Walter loses his gravity and Danny saves him from disappearing into space. When Walter takes his turn, a defective robot chases him through the house. When Danny takes his turn, he gets close to a planet called Tsouris 3 and gets shorter and wider. Soon, a Zorgon ship appears and Zorgons board their house. The robot chases the Zorgons away as Walter takes his turn and gets sucked into a black hole and is sent back in time. Walter transports back to when he was with Danny in the park. Danny finds Jumanji and is about to take it home, but Walter throws it out and instead offers to play catch with Danny. Evidently, having gone through these dangerous adventures and helped each other has brought the two brothers closer to each other. Reception Publishers Weekly said the book was a \\"satisfying enigma\\" like its predecessor. Booklist said readers of Jumanji would also like Zathura. Alternatively, The Horn Book Magazine said the book did not work as a sequel to Jumanji but worked as part of a series. Film adaptation A film adaptation of the book titled Zathura: A Space Adventure was made in 2005, directed by Jon Favreau. It received positive reviews from critics but was not a commercial success.

CG rendering of Adam Air's PK-KKW Boeing 737-4Q8 Adam Air had been involved in talks with multiple private investors, including discussions about the sale of a 20% stake to Qantas, a takeover bid from private equity fund Texas Pacific Group, and a planned initial public offering in Singapore. However, foreign investment interest evaporated with the crash of Flight 574. Indonesian investment firm PT Bhakti Investama Tbk was interested in acquiring Adam Air. The company already owned a stake in PT Indonesia Air Transport Tbk, a subsidiary of Pt Media Nusantara Citra Tbk, the southeast Asia's largest and most integrated media group, and president Hary Djaja says that \\"Given our experience with IAT, which has an excellent safety record, we're certain that we will be able to create positive synergies and improve the way Adam Air is run.\\".Indonesian firm to acquire troubled Adam Air - english.eastday.com Compiled by Shanghai Daily - March 20, 2007 - Obtained March 22, 2007.

Bhakti Investama's investor relations official Henry Suparman did not cite any specific safety incident in the airline but said that Bhakti had not seen any significant progress in the airline's handling of safety issues in the past year.Bhakti consortium pulls out of Adam Air over safety issues - Antara News - Obtained March 17, 2008. ControversySafety= Adam Air's safety record, like a number of other Indonesian airlines, had been heavily criticised. Pilots had reported repeated and deliberate breaches of international safety regulations due to the airline's attitude towards them and aircraft being flown in non-airworthy states for months at a time. They said that there had been such incidents as: # Requests to sign documents to allow an aircraft to fly, while not having the authority to do so or knowing that the plane was not airworthy (or both), # Flying one plane with a damaged door handle and another with a damaged window for months, # Swapping parts between planes to avoid mandatory replacement deadlines, # Being ordered to fly after exceeding the take-off limit of five times per pilot per day, # Using spare parts from other planes to attempt to keep planes in the air, and # Ignoring pilots' requests to abort takeoff, even though the planes were obviously unsafe. The Associated Press quoted one Adam Air pilot as saying that \\"Every time you flew, you had to fight with the ground staff and the management about all the regulations you had to violate.\\" They also said that if the airline's pilots confronted their seniors, they were grounded or docked pay. =Corruption= The Asia Times said it had spoken to \\"some well-placed local sources requesting anonymity\\", who claim that Agung Laksono didn't invest any of his own money into Adam Air, instead using money available to him through his official government position. Furthermore, Laksono's position gave him the unfair advantage of receiving heavily regulated licenses and airport landing rights. The same people claimed that the Ang family had no previous experience in the aviation industry. Adam Air's original advertising campaign contained statements considered by many to be direct lies, telling passengers to take to the skies with its \\"new Boeing 737-400s\\", despite the fact that its two Boeings, leased from GE Capital Aviation Services, were used and over fifteen years old. At the time Adam Air was founded, the 737 aircraft families (Boeing 737s and 737 Classics) making up Adam Air's fleet had been out-of-production for several years, long replaced by the 737 Next-Generation family.Information about the Boeing 737 After an incident in which an Adam Air aircraft (Flight 782) with 145 people on board was lost for hours, eventually making an emergency landing in West Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara, some 525 kilometers away from its intended destination, the pilots blamed a malfunctioning navigation system. The airline claimed the equipment to be in good working order, and had the pilots arrested on charges of endangering passenger safety. Immediately after the incident, the Directorate General of Air Communications (DGAC) sent instructions to Adam Air to repair the faulty system. The airline was then required to conduct a total of thirteen test flights with DGAC inspectors aboard before the aircraft could be returned to commercial service. Adam Air instead left behind a team from the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), who they were supposed to transport to the site, and sent only their own engineers. According to Adam Air, they repaired the fault, and the aircraft was immediately returned to service without any inspection. Iksan Tatang, director general of air transportation, said the incident was \\"a serious violation\\", and promised a full investigation. However, no sign of the investigation's findings exists on the public record, and it is unclear whether the investigation took place at all. Critics say Adam Air used its political connections to sidestep aviation authorities. When asked by Tempo magazine what caused the fatal crash of Adam Air Flight 574 in January 2007, before Adam Air agreed (nine months later) to help find the wreckage, chief executive officer Suherman said: \\"It was a weather problem. Everything was okay when the plane took off, except for the X factor. We are not God.\\" However, at that time, the Asia Times was already suggesting that because of corruption, the real cause of the crash might never be known. =Other legal issues= Large numbers of pilots joined the airline when it was founded in 2003, but most of them quit years later over safety concerns. On 10 January 2007 there was a report that Indonesian consumer and labour groups were planning to lodge a US$100 million suit, claiming the airline neglected safety in order to save money. On 21 February 2007 it was reported that thirteen Adam Air employees, as well as an employee of airport operator PT Angkasa Pura, working at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport had been arrested for fraudulent data manipulation. The scheme involved manipulating passenger data to show passengers as 'leaving the country'. This meant that they were automatically charged a duty of 30,000 Rupiah each, when in reality they owed none. The money was then split between fourteen staff members. A computer from the check-in desk, as well as passenger tickets and lists, were seized.Air crew nabbed for data manipulation - The Jakarta Post - Obtained March 1, 2007.

Adam Air decreased its frequencies to only several flights departing both from Jakarta Airport and Surabaya Airport. On 16 March 2008, Adam Air was given 21 days by the Indonesian government to decide whether to close down after safety concerns prompted an investment group to unload its 50 percent stake in the airline. The following day, the president of Adam Air announced that more than half of the fleet had been seized after the airline defaulted on payments. \\"Out of 22 planes, now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default. The other 10 have been declared in default as well, but I'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments,\\" Adam Suherman was quoted as saying.Adam Air Loses Half Its Fleet After Default On 18 March 2008, after the accident at Batam, in which a Boeing 737 skidded off the runway while landing, the Indonesian government suspended Adam Air's Air Operator Certificate and gave them three months to show safety improvements.Air&Cosmos; On 18 June 2008, the Indonesian government definitively revoked Adam Air's operator certificate, and the airline ceased operations. \\\\- Departemen Perhubungan - June 19, 2008 - Retrieved July 2, 2008 Prior to its demise, the company was in serious financial trouble.

The plane was subsequently flown into a radar \\"black spot\\" and was lost for several hours, eventually making an emergency landing at Tambolaka Airport, Sumba (on a different island 481 km away from their intended destination, and southeast from their origin, instead of northeast).

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-400 with the registration PK-KKW (c/n 24070), had 96 passengers and 6 crew. On January 10, parts of the aircraft's tail stabilizer were found 300m offshore. The flight recorders and suspected debris were located, but were not initially recovered due to a dispute between Adam Air and the Indonesian Government over who should pay recovery costs.On August 27, 2007, both flight recorders were recovered and were subsequently sent to the United States for analysis.Indonesian airline, government battle over retrieval of black box - monstersandcritics.com (news section) - retrieved on January 26, 2007. Both recorders were retrieved after Adam Air agreed to pay for 7 days worth of searching. A 2009 episode of Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) about Flight 574 stated that the official crash report had concluded the Inertial Reference System (IRS) had failed. This failure, which should not by itself have brought the plane down, caused the pilots to become preoccupied with trying to fix it. After changing the IRS from \\"Navigate\\" mode to \\"Attitude\\" mode, the pilots failed to manually fly the plane while the computer system recalibrated, a procedure that takes about 30 seconds. The failure to maintain straight and level flight during the recalibration caused the autopilot to completely disengage and cease compensating for the plane's tendency to roll to the right, which caused the nose of the plane to dip. In attempting to correct the pitch of the aircraft before levelling the wings, the pilot sent the aircraft into an unrecoverable downward spiral, leading to the plane suffering massive structural failure as it descended at near the speed of sound. The investigation disclosed that the accident aircraft, including the faulty IRS and several other systems, had been the subject of more than 40 pilot complaints, or \\"write ups\\" in the months prior to the crash. =Flight 172= On February 21, 2007 Flight 172, an Adam Air Boeing 737-300 aircraft flying from Jakarta to Surabaya with registration PK-KKV (c/n 27284), had a hard landing at Juanda International Airport. The incident caused the fuselage of the plane to crack and bend at the middle, with the tail of the plane drooping towards the ground. There were no reports of serious injuries from the incident. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to alternate airports. As a result, six Adam Air 737s were grounded awaiting safety checks, but five of these were then put back in regular service.Indonesia's aviation safety agency to publish preliminary report into New Year's Day Adam Air crash despite failure to locate black boxes - www.flightglobal.com - Obtained March 5, 2007.

Unable to control the political and economic troubles that the nation faced, he was forced to return power to civilian rule, marking the end of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces installed by a coup d'etat on 3 October 1968. At age , he is currently the oldest living former Peruvian president.  Early years  Born in Lima in 1921, he is the son of Army Colonel Remigio Morales Bermúdez and grandson of ex-President Remigio Morales Bermúdez. He received most of his education at Lima's Colegio Inmaculada. In 1939, he was accepted to the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos (Chorrillos Military School). After his graduation, he was an important member of the Centro de Altos Estudios Militares (CAEM).  Political career  Bermúdez achieved the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed to his first political post in 1968 as Minister of Economy and Finance in the administration of Fernando Belaúnde. Internal problems in government forced him to resign after two months. In 1968, after Belaúnde had been deposed by a coup, the military government led by Velasco asked him to return to the post of Minister of Economy and Finance. In 1974, he resigned again, this time because he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Peruvian Army. In 1975, he was appointed to be both Prime Minister and Minister of War. Presidency With Velasco's health deteriorating, Morales Bermúdez led a military coup against General Velasco and took over as President of Peru on 29 August 1975, leading the country through one of its most severe economic crises. He diverged from the socialist-leaning tendencies of first phase (1968–1975) of the Peruvian Revolution, proclaiming a 'Second Phase' that would lead to a return to democracy.  Legacy  The failure of his political and economic reforms was a severe blow to his administration, hampered by constant political pressure from all sides. A Constitutional Assembly was created in 1978, which replaced the 1933 Constitution enacted during Óscar R. Benavides's presidency; he also called for national elections the next year. After the 1980 National Elections he turned power over to a legally established government, headed by President Fernando Belaúnde. After his presidency, he kept a relatively low profile in Peruvian politics, making sporadic speeches regarding the situation of the army. In 1985, he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency, obtaining a fraction of one percent of the vote. Morales Bermudez in October 2016 Morales Bermudez was prosecuted by Italian judge Luisianna Figliolia for the forced disappearance of 25 Italian citizens in the context of Operation Condor, a campaign of political oppression against Marxism orchestrated by the right-wing dictatorships of South America in the 1970s.General Morales Bermúdez sorprendido de su inclusión en juicio italiano .

Opened in 1867, late in the regime of Napoleon III, it was built according to plans by Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, who created all the major parks demanded by the Emperor.Dominique Jarrassé, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pg. 122 The park has of roads and of paths.

History The park took its name from the bleak hill which occupied the site, which, because of the chemical composition of its soil, was almost bare of vegetation – it was called Chauve-mont, or bare hill. The area, just outside the limits of Paris until the mid-19th century, had a sinister reputation; it was the site of the Gibbet of Montfaucon, the notorious place where from the 13th century until 1760, the bodies of hanged criminals were displayed after their executions.Patrice de Moncan, Paris - Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, p. 101.

The director of public works of Paris and builder of the Park, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, reported that \\"the site spread infectious emanations not only to the neighboring areas, but, following the direction of the wind, over the entire city.\\"Alphand, Les Promenades de Paris. Cited in Patrice de Moncan. Another part of the site was a former gypsum and limestone quarry mined for the construction of buildings in Paris and in the United States. This raw material was used for a long time to produce plaster and lime. In order to make lime, gypsum was heated in furnaces. This activity was maintained until the second half of the 19th century. By the end of the 1850s, the quarry was exhausted. That quarry also yielded Eocene mammal fossils, including Palaeotherium, which were studied by Georges Cuvier. This not-very-promising site was chosen by Baron Haussmann, the Prefet of Paris, for the site of a new public park for the recreation and pleasure of the rapidly growing population of the new 19th and 20th arrondissements of Paris, which had been annexed to the city in 1860. The work on the park began in 1864, under the direction of Alphand, who used all the experience and lessons he had learned in making the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. Two years were required simply to terrace the land. Then a railroad track was laid to bring in cars carrying two hundred thousand cubic meters of topsoil. A thousand workers remade the landscape, digging a lake and shaping the lawns and hillsides. Explosives were used to sculpt the buttes themselves and the former quarry into a picturesque mountain fifty meters high with cliffs, an interior grotto, pinnacles and arches. Hydraulic pumps were installed to lift the water from the canal of the Ourcq River up the highest point on the promontory, to create a dramatic waterfall.

Électrographie turn-of-the-century photography The chief gardener of Paris, horticulturist Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, then went to work, planting thousands of trees, shrubs and flowers, along with creating sloping lawns. At the same time, the city's chief architect, Gabriel Davioud, designed the miniature Roman temple on the top of the promontory, modeled after that at Tivoli near Rome, as well as belvederes, restaurants modeled after Swiss chalets, and gatehouses like rustic cottages, completing the imaginary landscape. The park opened on 1 April 1867, coinciding with the opening of the Paris Universal Exposition, and becoming an instant popular success with the Parisians.Patrice de Moncan, Paris - Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, pp. 101-106.

The original temple was the subject of many romantic landscape paintings from the 17th to the 19th century, and inspired similar architectural follies in the English landscape garden of the 18th century. The temple was designed by Gabriel Davioud, the city architect for Paris, who designed picturesque monuments for the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Monceau, and other city parks. He also designed some of the most famous fountains of Paris, including the Fontaine Saint-Michel. The temple was finished in 1867. File:Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich 007.jpgThe Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy was the subject of many romantic landscape paintings in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The main entrance to the park is at Place Armand- Carrel, where stands the mairie (town hall) of the 19th arrondissement, also designed by Davioud. There are five other large gates to the park — Porte Bolivar, Porte de la Villette, Porte Secrétan, Porte de Crimée, and Porte Fessart — and seven smaller gates. As of 2019, the park hosts three restaurants (Pavillon du Lac, Pavillon Puebla, and Rosa Bonheur), two reception halls, two Guignol theatres, and two waffle stands. The two Guignol theatres were established in 1892. The park has four Wi-fi zones as part of a citywide wireless Internet-access plan. Flora A cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus libani) in the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. The park was envisioned by Napoleon III as a garden showcase, a vision that continue to guide the park's direction. Currently, there are more than 47 species of plants, trees, and shrubs cultivated in the park. Many of the plants and trees found in the park were those originally planted when the park was created. The park boasts many varieties of indigenous and exotic trees (many of which are Asian species): in particular, several cedars of Lebanon planted in 1880, Himalayan cedars, Ginkgo Biloba, Byzantine hazelnuts, Siberian elms, European hollies, and bamboo-leafed prickly ashes, among many others. Tree species found in the park include: * Oriental Plane * Hackberry * Ornamental Pears * Ginkgos * Common Alder * European Beech * Giant Sequoia * European Black Pine * Large-leaved Linden * Tulip Tree Metro stations The Parc des Buttes Chaumont is served by Lines 5 and 7bis 18px 18px Culture In September, the park hosts Paris's annual Silhouette Short Film Festival. The Silhouette Festival features seven days of French and international short films, followed by an awards ceremony. In 2008, a modern version of the traditional Guinguette, Rosa Bonheur, was established inside the park. This unique restaurant and dance venue is government-sponsored by the Mairie of the 19th arrondissement. References   Hedi Slimane (2002). Interview for Index Magazine.

Laboratory flasks are vessels or containers that fall into the category of laboratory equipment known as glassware. In laboratory and other scientific settings, they are usually referred to simply as flasks. Flasks come in a number of shapes and a wide range of sizes, but a common distinguishing aspect in their shapes is a wider vessel \\"body\\" and one (or sometimes more) narrower tubular sections at the top called necks which have an opening at the top. Laboratory flask sizes are specified by the volume they can hold, typically in metric units such as milliliters (mL or ml) or liters (L or l). Laboratory flasks have traditionally been made of glass, but can also be made of plastic. At the opening(s) at top of the neck of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or sometimes volumetric flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints. Some flasks, especially volumetric flasks, come with a laboratory rubber stopper, bung, or cap for capping the opening at the top of the neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper. Flasks can be used for making solutions or for holding, containing, collecting, or sometimes volumetrically measuring chemicals, samples, solutions, etc. for chemical reactions or other processes such as mixing, heating, cooling, dissolving, precipitation, boiling (as in distillation), or analysis. List of flasks There are several types of laboratory flasks, all of which have different functions within the laboratory. Flasks, because of their use, can be divided into: *Reaction flasks, which are usually spherical (i.e. round-bottom flask) and are accompanied by their necks, at the ends of which are ground glass joints to quickly and tightly connect to the rest of the apparatus (such as a reflux condenser or dropping funnel). The reaction flask is usually made of thick glass and can tolerate large pressure differences, with the result that one can be kept both in a reaction under vacuum, and pressure, sometimes simultaneously. Some varieties are: **Multiple neck flasks, which can have two to five, and less commonly, six necks, each topped by ground glass connections which are used in more complex reactions that require the controlled mixing of multiple reagents. **Schlenk flask, which is a spherical flask with a ground glass opening and a hose outlet and a vacuum stopcock. The tap makes it easy to connect the flask to a vacuum- nitrogen line through the hose and to facilitate the carrying out of a reaction either in vacuum or in an atmosphere of nitrogen. *Distillation flasks, which are intended to contain mixtures that are subject to distillation, as well as to receive the products of distillation. Distillation flasks are available in various shapes. Similar to the reaction flasks, the distillation flasks usually have only one narrow neck and a ground glass joint and are made of thinner glass than the reaction flask, so that they are easier to heat. They are sometimes spherical, test tube shaped or pear-shaped, also known as Kjeldahl Flasks, due to their use with Kjeldahl bulbs. *Reagent flasks are usually flat-bottomed flasks, which can thus be conveniently placed on the table or in a cabinet. These flasks cannot withstand too much pressure or temperature differences, due to the stresses which arise in a flat bottom; these flasks are usually made of weaker glass than reaction flasks. Certain types of flasks are supplied with a ground glass stopper in them, and others that have threaded necks close with an appropriate nut or automatic dispenser. These flasks are available in two standard shapes: *Round-bottom flasks are shaped like a tube emerging from the top of a sphere. The flasks are often long neck; sometimes they have the incision on the neck, which precisely defines the volume of flask. They can be used in distillations, or in the heating a product. These types of flask are alternatively called Florence flasks. *Flasks with flat bottom. *Cassia flasks, for the analysis of essential oils and aldehyde determination, approx. 100 ml, neck graduated 0 - 6 : 0,1 ml. *Erlenmeyer flask [introduced in 1861 by German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825–1909)] - is shaped like a cone, usually completed by the ground joint, the conical flasks are very popular because of their low price (they are easy to manufacture) and portability *Volumetric flask is used for preparing liquids with volumes of high precision. It is a flask with an approximately pear-shaped body and a long neck with a circumferential fill line. *Dewar flask is a double-walled flask having a near-vacuum between the two walls. These come in a variety of shapes and sizes; some are large and tube-like, others are shaped like regular flasks. *Evaporating flasks (for rotary evaporator) centered, pear shaped, with socket or with flange. *Powder flasks, for drying of powdered substances, pear shaped, with socket *Retorts are simplified distillation apparatuses, with long, down turned necks, and round bases. They have largely been replaced by condensers. *Büchner flask or Sidearm flask or Suction flask - they are a flat-bottomed flask, but made of very thick and resistant glass. They are usually a cone shape - similar to the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask, but also have side neck, usually affixed to the side, 2 / 3 up from the bottom. The flasks are used to cooperate with vacuum aspirator or vacuum pumps in the vacuum filtration, or as additional security during the distillation and other processes carried out under reduced pressure. *Culture flasks for growing cells are designed to improve aeration by including baffles that aid in mixing when placed on a shaker table. *Beaker (glassware) Many of these flasks can be wrapped in a protective outer layer of glass, leaving a gap between the inner and outer walls. These are called jacketed flasks; they are often used in a reaction using a cooling fluid. Image:Conical flask.svgErlenmeyer flask or conical flask.

Legal issues Like many other common pieces of glassware, Erlenmeyer flasks could potentially be used in the production of drugs. In an effort to reduce their proliferation by theft from education institutions where they are commonly stored, some U.S. states (including Texas) have requirements to audit and report unusual inventory discrepancies (not from wear or breakage). Reporting requirements also cover chemicals identified as common starting materials. 080107 thecb.state.tx.us  References External links Category:Laboratory glassware Category:Vessels ","title":"Laboratory flask"},{"id":"1628002","text":"Oswaldo Enrique López Arellano (30 June 1921 – 16 May 2010) was a Honduran politician who twice served as the President of Honduras, first from 1963 to 1971 and again from 1972 until 1975. Early life He was born in Danlí in the department of El Paraíso to an influential family, son of Enrique López and Carlota Arellano. He joined the Army at eighteen, graduated as a pilot from the Honduran Air Force School, and spent 1942-1945 in the U.S. state of Arizona studying mechanical aviation. López served as a colonel for a long time and eventually rose to the rank of general. Career López served briefly during 1957 on a military junta, which resigned after elections were held. After a violent coup, he served as president for the first time from 3 October 1963 until 7 June 1971. He then allowed further elections (1971 Honduran general election) to take place in April 1971 that saw Ramón Ernesto Cruz come to power. On 4 December 1972, López again seized power, in the 1972 Honduran coup d'état. During his second tenure as president, López oversaw a major land reform bill that sought to defuse tensions among peasants over their forced removal from uncultivated lands owned by landed elites or by US fruit companies. This plan was called the National Development Plan and went through two stages, the first in 1965 and the most significant ones between 1972 and 1975. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1972, a Minimum Wage Act in 1973, and a Land Reform Act in 1975 came in response to the peasant union pressure, such as the CTH, Confederación de Trabajadores Hondureños and the ANACH Associación Nacional de Campesinos Hondureños. The most important unions clamoring for reform, however, were the United Fruit and Standard Fruit unions SITRATERCO and SUSTRAFSCO, respectively, that included industrial workers as well. =Resignation= In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exposed a scheme by United Brands Company to bribe President López with US$1.25 million, with the promise of another $1.25 million upon the reduction of certain banana export taxes. Trading in United Brands stock was halted, and on 22 April 1975 López was ousted in a military coup led by his fellow General Juan Alberto Melgar, in the 1975 Honduran coup d'état. This scandal is known in Honduras as \\"Bananagate\\". Personal life López was a businessman. He owned several businesses in Central America. His eldest son, Oswaldo, died in 2003. He was the owner of TAN-SAHSA, the now defunct Honduran air carrier. Lopez died on 16 May 2010 at the age of 88 while undergoing surgery for prostate cancer.

Other than Switzerland, it is sold in several other countries, notably the Netherlands, and is available in several varieties depending on the country. History In 1950 Roberth Barth and the biologist Hans Süsli Zurich used a recipe initially conceived to produce a beer made with whey to create a soft drink, which came to be marketed as Rivella Red in 1952, when Rivella AG was founded. The name Rivella was inspired by the municipality of Riva San Vitale in Canton Ticino and the Italian word for \\"revelation\\", rivelazione. The initial production began in Stäfa before moving to Rothrist, where it remains to this day. Second variety of Rivella was launched in 1958 in the Netherlands and in 1959 in Switzerland, known as Rivella Blue, a lower calorie alternative to the original recipe. It was the first diet soft drink to be launched in Europe. A third variety, Rivella Green, was launched in 1999 made with green tea extract, and Rivella Yellow, made with soy milk as an alternative to milk whey, in 2008. In 2000 the presidency was passed on from Robert Barth to his son Alexander Barth, before the death of Robert Barth in 2007. Until 2008, Swiss supermarket chain Migros stocked an own-brand version of the beverage called Mivella, which was made by Rivella specifically for the supermarket. In 2008, Migros replaced it with Rivella as it did not enjoy the same popularity among customers as the original drink. In 1977 Rivella began sponsoring the Swiss National Ski team. In 2017 they celebrated 40 years of partnership in St. Moritz.

This reduces the energy content to 30 kJ (approx. 7 kcal) per 100 ml. * Rivella Green also contains green tea extracts (0.05%). Its energy content is 90 kJ (approx. 22 kcal) per 100 ml. * Rivella CLIQ combines the classic Rivella taste with rhubarb or peach flavourings. The energy content of both varieties is 160 kJ (approx. 37 kcal) per 100 ml. Availability Rivella is seen as Switzerland's national beverage. The share by value of Rivella AG in the Swiss soft drinks market was 15.3 per cent in 2013, putting Rivella second to Coca-Cola. Rivella is a long-established brand in the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Rivella Light was launched as a diabetic beverage in the Netherlands in 1958. It appeared on the Swiss market one year later (1959) as Rivella Blue. The Netherlands remain the largest foreign market for Rivella. Rivella is also available in the regions bordering Switzerland in Germany, France and Austria. Rivella beverages available abroad are made to the same recipe as in Switzerland with the exception of the Netherlands, where beverages are made by Rivella licensing partner Vrumona using concentrate supplied by Rivella.

She worked between the United Kingdom and the east coast of Canada until September 1939, when a torpedo from the German submarine sank her in the Western Approaches. Athenia was the first UK ship to be sunk by Germany during World War II, and the incident accounted for the Donaldson Line's greatest single loss of life at sea, with 117 civilian passengers and crew killed. The sinking was condemned as a war crime. Among those dead were 28 US citizens, leading Germany to fear that the US might join the war on the side of the UK and France. Wartime German authorities denied that one of their vessels had sunk the ship. An admission of responsibility did not come from German authorities until 1946. She was the second Donaldson ship of that name to be torpedoed and sunk off Inishtrahull by a German submarine. The earlier was similarly attacked and sunk in 1918. Construction The Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Govan in Glasgow built Athenia, launching her on 28 January 1922 and completing her in 1923. She measured and , was long between perpendiculars by beam and had a depth of . She had six steam turbines driving twin screws via double reduction gearing, giving her a speed of . She had capacity for 516 cabin class passengers and 1,000 in 3rd class. By 1930 her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding, and by 1934 this had been augmented with an echo sounding device and a gyrocompass. Career Athenia was built for Anchor- Donaldson Line, which was a joint venture between Anchor Line and Donaldson Line. Fairfield built a sister ship, , which was launched in October 1924 and was completed in 1925. Athenia and Letitia were the two largest ships in Donaldson's various fleets. The ships worked Anchor-Donaldson's trans-Atlantic route linking Liverpool and Glasgow with Quebec and Montreal in summer and to Halifax in winter. After the construction of the Pier 21 immigration complex in Halifax in 1928, Athenia became a more frequent caller at Halifax, making over 100 trips to Halifax with immigrants. In 1935 Anchor Line went into liquidation and Donaldson Line bought most of its assets. In 1936 Donaldson was reconstituted as Donaldson Atlantic Line. Loss Workers painting Athenias stern, summer 1937 On 1 September 1939 Athenia, commanded by Captain James Cook, left Glasgow for Montreal via Liverpool and Belfast. She carried 1,103 passengers, including about 500 Jewish refugees, 469 Canadians, 311 US citizens and 72 UK subjects, and 315 crew. Despite clear indications that war would break out any day, she departed Liverpool at 13:00 hrs on 2 September without recall, and on the evening of the 3rd was south of Rockall and northwest of Inishtrahull, Ireland, when she was sighted by the commanded by Oberleutnant Fritz-Julius Lemp around 16:30. Lemp later claimed that the fact that she was a darkened ship steering a zigzag course which seemed to be well off the normal shipping routes made him believe she was either a troopship, a Q-ship or an armed merchant cruiser. U-30 tracked Athenia for three hours until eventually, at 19:40, when both vessels were between Rockall and Tory Island, Lemp ordered two torpedoes to be fired. One exploded on Athenias port side in her engine room, and she began to settle by the stern. Several ships, including the , responded to Athenias distress signal. Electras commander, Lt. Cdr. Sammy A. Buss, was senior officer present and took charge. He sent the F-class destroyer on an anti-submarine sweep of the area, while Electra, another E-class destroyer, , the Swedish yacht Southern Cross, the Norwegian tanker MS Knute Nelson, and the US cargo ship , rescued survivors. Between them they rescued about 981 passengers and crew. The German liner , en route from New York to Murmansk, also received Athenias distress signal, but ignored it. City of Flint took 223 survivors to Pier 21 at Halifax, and Knute Nelson landed 450 at Galway. Survivors in one of Athenias lifeboats alongside Athenia remained afloat for more than 14 hours, until she finally sank stern first at 10:40 the next morning. Of the 1,418 aboard, 98 passengers The CWGC puts the number of civilians killed at 64 and 19 crew members were killed. Many died in the engine room and aft stairwell, where the torpedo hit. The British crews were famous for putting the passengers' lives before their own, and were expertly trained to handle such \\"events\\"; nonetheless, about 50 people died when one of the lifeboats was crushed in the propeller of Knute Nelson. No. 5A lifeboat came alongside the empty tanker and tied up, against advice, astern of No 12 lifeboat. Only separated the life boat from the tanker's exposed propeller. Once No. 12 lifeboat was emptied it was cast adrift and began to sink. This fact was reported to the bridge of Knute Nelson. For some reason the ship's engine order telegraph was then set to full ahead. 5A lifeboat's mooring line or \\"warp\\" parted under the stress, causing the lifeboat to be pulled back into the revolving propeller. There was a second accident at about 05:00 hrs when No. 8 lifeboat capsized in a heavy sea below the stern of the yacht Southern Cross, killing ten people. Three passengers were crushed to death while trying to transfer from lifeboats to the Royal Navy destroyers. Other deaths were due to falling overboard from Athenia and her lifeboats, or to injuries and exposure. Ultimately, all deaths were the result of the U-boat violating orders and torpedoing a merchant passenger liner. 54 dead were Canadian and 28 were US citizens, which led to German fears that the incident would bring the US into the war. =Aftermath= It was not until the Nuremberg Trials after the War that the truth of the U-boat sinking of Athenia finally came out. The sinking was given dramatic publicity throughout the English-speaking world. The front pages of many newspapers ran photographs of the lost ship along with headlines about the UK's declaration of war. For example, the Halifax Herald for 4 September 1939 had a banner across its front page announcing \\"LINER ATHENIA IS TORPEDOED AND SUNK\\" with, in the center of the page, \\"EMPIRE AT WAR\\" in outsized red print. A Canadian girl, 10-year-old Margaret Hayworth, was among the casualties, and was one of the first Canadians to be killed by enemy action. Newspapers widely publicised the story, proclaiming \\"Ten-Year-Old Victim of Torpedo\\" as \\"Canadians Rallying Point\\", and set the tone for their coverage of the rest of the war. One thousand people met the train that brought her body back to Hamilton, Ontario, and there was a public funeral attended by the mayor of Hamilton, the city council, the Lieutenant-Governor, Albert Edward Matthews, Premier Mitchell Hepburn, and the entire Ontario cabinet. When Grand Admiral Raeder first heard of the sinking of Athenia, he made inquiries and was told that no U-boat was nearer than to the location of the sinking. He therefore told the US chargé d'affaires in good faith that the German Navy had not been responsible. When, on 27 September, U-30 returned to Wilhelmshaven, Lemp reported to Admiral Dönitz that he had sunk Athenia in error. Dönitz at once sent Lemp to Berlin, where he explained the incident to Raeder. In turn, Raeder reported to Hitler, who decided that the incident should be kept secret for political reasons. Raeder decided against court-martialling Lemp because he considered that he had made an understandable mistake, and the log of U-30, which was seen by many people, was altered to sustain the official denials. A month later the Völkischer Beobachter, the Nazi party's official newspaper, published an article which blamed the loss of Athenia on the UK, accusing Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, of sinking the ship to turn neutral opinion against Germany. Raeder claimed not to have known about this previous to publication and said that if he had known about it, he would have prevented its appearing. In the US, 60 per cent of respondents to a Gallup poll believed the Germans were responsible, despite their initial claims that Athenia had been sunk by the UK for propaganda purposes, with only 9 per cent believing otherwise. Some anti-interventionists called for restraint while at the same time expressing their abhorrence of the sinking. Boake Carter described it as a criminal act. Some were not completely convinced that Germany was in fact responsible. Herbert Hoover expressed his doubts, saying, \\"It is such poor tactics that I cannot believe that even the clumsy Germans would do such a thing\\", while North Carolina senator Robert Rice Reynolds denied that Germany had any motive to sink Athenia. At best, he said, such an action \\"could only further inflame the world, and particularly America, against Germany, with no appreciable profits from the sinking.\\" He added that Britain could have had a motive – \\"to infuriate the American people\\". It was not until January 1946, during the case against Admiral Raeder at the Nuremberg trials, that a statement by Admiral Dönitz was read in which he finally admitted that Athenia had been torpedoed by U-30 and that every effort had been made to cover it up. Lemp, who claimed he had mistaken her for an armed merchant cruiser, took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy. After Athenias sinking, conspiracy theories were circulated by pro-Axis and anti-British circles. For example, one editor in Boston's Italian News suggested the ship had been sunk by British mines and blamed on German U-boats to draw America into the war. (weekly column) The claims were unfounded. =Cargo= A cargo of 888 tons was taken on in Glasgow, 472 tons of which were building bricks. Other items included granite curling rocks from Scotland, textbooks for the Toronto school system, a number of sealed steel boxes containing new clothes purchased in Europe by tourists, and watercolor paintings by passenger and English illustrator Winifred Walker, intended for her planned book, Shakespeare's Flowers. Excavations of Urartu antiquities by the American scholars Kirsopp and Silva Lake during 1938–1940 and most of their finds and field records were lost in the sinking of the ship. On 4 September 1939, curling stone manufacturer Andrew Kay & Co. sent a cablegram to its sales representative in Toronto stating, \\"We now learn that the Athenia was this morning sunk off the coast of Scotland, and we regret that the finest consignment of curling stones that have ever yet left our factory has gone with it.\\" According to James Wyllie, secretary and director of Kays of Scotland (as the company is now known) in 2018, three bills of lading for this shipment included 48 pairs of Blue Hone Ailsa curling stones for the London, Ontario Curling Club, 41 pairs of Blue Hone Ailsa curling stones for the Toronto High Park Curling Club, and 50 pairs of Red Hone Ailsa curling stones for the Lindsay Curling Club. This is a total of 278 Andrew Kay & Co. Excelsior Ailsa curling stones with handles and cases weighing nearly six tons with a 1939 value of (equivalent to £ in ). =Wreck discovery= In 2017, the oceanographer and marine archaeologist David Mearns found a wreck he believes to be Athenia. Mearns located the wreck on Rockall Bank using sonar imagery that was scanned by the Geological Survey of Ireland to map the sea floor. He stated \\"Can I go into a court of law and say, '100%, that's Athenia?' No. But barring a photograph I can say in my expert opinion there's a very, very high probability that that's Athenia. Everything fits.\\" =Legality of sinking= As Athenia was an unarmed passenger ship, the attack violated the Hague conventions and the London Naval Treaty of 1930 that allowed all warships, including submarines, to stop and search merchant vessels, but forbade capture as prize or sinking unless the ship was carrying contraband or engaged in military activity. Even if this was the case, and if it was decided to sink their ship, it was required that passengers and crew must be transferred to a \\"place of safety\\" as a priority. Although Germany had not signed the 1930 treaty, the German 1936 Prize Rules (Prisenordnung) binding their naval commanders copied most of its restrictions. Lemp of U-30 did none of these things, choosing instead to fire without warning. Memorials The lost British members of Athenias crew are commemorated at the Tower Hill Memorial in London. Canadian crew who died are listed at the Halifax Memorial (Sailor's Memorial) at Point Pleasant Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia as well as by special plaque for Hannah Baird, a Canadian stewardess who died in the sinking and who is commemorated in a memorial to female merchant mariners in Langford, British Columbia. Popular culture No movie has been made of the full story of the sinking, but the film Arise, My Love (1940), directed by Mitchell Leisen and starring Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland, had a sequence involving the torpedoing of the liner. The song Rollerskate Skinny, written by Rhett Miller and performed by his band The Old 97's, mentions Athenias sinking. In John Dickson Carr's novel The Man Who Could Not Shudder, Dr Fell announces the end of story by showing his audience a newspaper bearing headline \\"LINER ATHENIA: FULL LIST OF VICTIMS\\". He means to say that the Second World War has begun and the truth of the mystery is now unlikely to surface. The sinking of Athenia is also mentioned in Alyson Richman's novel The Lost Wife about pre-war Prague and how the dreams of two young lovers are shattered when they are separated by the Nazi invasion, their endurance and experiences during World War II and the Holocaust only to find one another again decades later in the United States. Recent extensive research concerning the incident appears in Cay Rademacher's 2009 book Drei Tage im September – die letzte Fahrt der Athenia, 1939 published by MareVerlag of Hamburg. In the novel by Norman Collins, London Belongs to Me, he describes the sinking of Athenia as war breaks out across Europe. As a result of the sinking, Londoners are in no doubt war has started, and start bracing themselves for what's to come. Similarly, at the close of Patrick Hamilton's Hangover Square (1941) the protagonist, George Bone, finds that the newspapers were \\"all about the sinking of the Athenia\\". The sinking of Athenia also forms part of the beginning in the movie U 47 – Kapitänleutnant Prien (1958). A graphic firsthand account of the sinking and rescue appears as the first chapter of James A. Goodson's autobiographical account of his wartime experiences as a fighter ace. The sinking of Athenia plays an integral part of the plot of the novel Nemesis by Rory Clements.

In the comic series of the same name, Kevin serves as the primary love interest for Samus Aran, both united against their archenemy Mother Brain. In both series, Kevin is summoned to Videoland from the real world by the Ultimate Warp Zone as the fabled Game Master known as \\"Captain N\\", to serve as a warrior of the Videoland royal family, using his outside knowledge of their universe (which in his own are various video games) to protect it from invasion. In the first series, Kevin is armed with a belt and holster equipped with a Power Pad and a NES Zapper, respectively being a device which can stop time, allowing him to leap over objects or give him super-speed over short distances, and a raygun which destroys his enemies and shoots Tetris blocks;Crichton, John. \\"Brian Ward Shouts Up Captain N on DVD .\\" Toonzone. February 23, 2007. in the second series he has technopathic abilities as in the original character pitch, as well as an interest in spacefaring. In the toyline, he is the principal hero. In Captain N: The Game Master (1989–1991) The character Captain N first appeared in Nintendo Power magazine, created by a Nintendo staff member and magazine editor named Randy Studdard (who presented Nintendo with a formal proposal that included the character as a company spokes-character, the origin and premise, and the Saturday morning cartoon as part of the entire marketing campaign). The original concept involved Captain N (originally known as \\"Captain Nintendo\\") as a Nintendo employee and the Mother Brain as piece of programming from a Nintendo game pak (that was infused in an explosion with experimental \\"organic\\" ROMs) that went rogue. Captain N had the power to temporarily give life to characters and items from Nintendo games. The story left a door open for a sequel (Mother Brain is temporarily defeated but her return was said to be inevitable, and Captain N vows to stop her when the time comes). Nintendo of America, Inc. later decided to follow Studdard's ideas and create a cartoon series, opting neither to credit nor to compensate its creator. DIC Entertainment was shopped as the animation studio, and changed various aspects of the original idea while keeping the main premise of the Captain opposing Mother Brain as he interacted with a number of video game characters. =Fictional character biography= In DIC Entertainment's Captain N: The Game Master cartoon series, Kevin Keene, while playing Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, is sucked through his television (alongside his dog Duke) by the Ultimate Warp Zone, fulfilling the Legend of Videoland, that a young warrior from another land would be warped to their world and lead Princess Lana (the ruler of Videoland) to victory. Kevin is selected to lead the N-Team, which consists of Lana, Simon Belmont, Mega Man, and Pit \\"Kid Icarus\\", none of whom show any confidence in Kevin's ability in the beginning. However, after Lana is kidnapped by shortly after Kevin's arrival, the reluctant group puts their differences aside to go on a rescue mission where Kevin eventually gains the others' confidence. During the second season, a sentient human-sized supercomputer known as \\"Game Boy\\" additionally joins the team. The protagonist of the series, Kevin is a reluctant hero and is often found at odds with the rest of the N-Team; in many episodes, he tries to foster a big-brotherly role to characters suffering from a particular plight. He is most often called Captain N by the other cast members, except Princess Lana who regularly addresses him by his first name. His last name is only ever mentioned in two episodes. He wears light denim jeans, a yellow shirt and a red Letterman jacket with white sleeves. The Varsity letter \\"N\\" on his jacket is for swimming. Duke Kevin is also the owner of a Golden Retriever named Duke, who jumps into the Ultimate Warp Zone immediately after Kevin was sucked in and ends up in Videoland as well. Duke is usually with Kevin through all the action in a given episode and sometimes sees his own independent bouts of action. Duke wears a bandanna around his neck, and is voiced by Tom Wright. In Videoland, Duke takes on an appearance more resembling a beagle than a Golden Retriever, while his intelligence levels are increased a hundredfold. Nonetheless, he shows occasional uncontrollable typical dog behavior, like the chase reflex. He also appears in the Captain N: The Game Master comic series, where-in he befriends Samus Aran. In Captain N: The Game Master comic series The Captain N comic book was published by Valiant Comics as part of the Nintendo Comics System in 1990. Despite being based on the television cartoon of the same name, it had a more serious tone, delving into the wider effects of the N-Team's conflict with Mother Brain against the galaxy at large, and including serial storytelling. Following an older Kevin, leading the N-Team following the departure of Simon Belmont and Mega Man, the groups meet famed bounty hunter and hero Samus Aran, who falls in love with Kevin, and becomes Lana's rival for his affections. When asked by a fan why Samus did not appear in the television series, Jeffrey Scott said \\"Never heard of her. That could be why.\\"Interview with Jeffrey Scott, The Unofficial Captain N Homepage An article at 1UP.COM describes Samus as \\"rambunctious, reckless, and gets into @#!*% contests with Lana over Kevin's affections, which makes for some of the most entertaining situations in the series\\".

Vollertsen practiced medicine in North Korea from 1999 to 2001 with the Cap Anamur Committee, a non-governmental cooperation organization. In August 1999, he and Francois Large, another aid worker, donated their skin to Pak Jong Thae, a tractor factory worker in Haeju, South Hwanghae, who had suffered burns over three-quarters of his body and underwent three skin grafting operations. In recognition of his contribution, Vollertsen received the official Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Friendship Medal for his humanitarian assistance later that same month, in a ceremony attended by Supreme People's Assembly vice-president Yang Hyong Sop. He was also given a pass that allowed him to travel through the country freely, which was very unusual for a foreigner. As he traveled in his capacity as an emergency physician, tending to the illnesses and injuries of common North Koreans in the countryside, he struggled with a nearly non-existent healthcare system, abject poverty and growing proof of a network of political prisons in North Korea that enforced the flow of wealth from the citizenry to the Pyongyang- based Korean People's Army and the Workers' Party of Korea which was then headed by Kim Jong-il. Using smuggled cameras, he obtained photos and films of flagrant, large-scale human rights violations in North Korea. In particular, mass starvation was used as a tool of political control. He began collecting evidence of abuses, which he passed to a visiting United States Congress man, an act for which he was put under surveillance. Despite this Vollertsen continued to speak out against the North Korean government, which soon lost patience and forced him to leave North Korea in January 2001. Soon after returning home, he gave an interview about his experiences in North Korea, which the North Korean government denounced. The North Korean government has portrayed him as a dishonest media manipulator who is suffering from mental instability. His wife, reacting to his decision to stay in South Korea as an anti-Kim activist, divorced him and is raising their children with a partner. \\"My wife blamed me for not taking care of my family. She said my vision, my goals, my projects, were worth much more to me. And afterwards, I realised she was right. I do not want to sacrifice my family. But I know my wife and her partner are taking care of my children, and that they are safe and healthy. But the North Korean children are not\\", said Vollertsen in 2003. In September 2006, Vollertsen claimed that he had been attacked by a gang and had been run over by a taxi while in Seoul prior to giving a speech on North Korea.

It is situated on the Redditch-Birmingham New Street-Lichfield Cross-City Line north east of Birmingham New Street. The station is of Victorian architecture with red brick and elaborate ceilings and pillars. One platform is sheltered while the other is open air. The main building itself is built on a hill with a tunnel running underneath it. It is accessed via Station Street and Railway Road. History The station was constructed in 1862, as the northern terminus of the line from Birmingham built by the London and North Western Railway. In 1884, the line was extended north to Lichfield, and after the grouping of railway companies in 1923, it came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The station was the location of the Sutton Coldfield train disaster on 23 January 1955 when an express from York to Bristol travelling at excessive speed derailed. A memorial to the 17 people who died was unveiled in the station concourse on 23 January 2016.BBC News, Memorial plaque for Sutton Coldfield rail crash, published 24 January 2016 From 1978, the station became one of those served by the new Cross-City Line, sponsored by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive. As part of that scheme, there were proposals to demolish the station and rebuild it, as happened to many of the other stations on the line. However, local campaigning saved it. =2003 repairwork= Following the provision of a large sum of money in 2003, the station underwent a programme of refurbishment. Many new facilities were provided, and repair work was undertaken to the station building. The southbound platform was repainted and a former wooden ticket office removed because it had become a target for vandalism and concerns were raised about its fire safety. A new ticket vending machine was placed on the platform which reduced queues at the ticket office in the main building. A station shop and a new waiting room were provided. On the northbound platform, the small waiting room was replaced with new seats. Passenger information system boards were also installed on both platforms which provides passengers with up-to-the-minute information on train times. The interior of the station was also repainted and the ticket office in the main building was extended.  Services  Train services operate every 10 minutes during the day Monday to Saturday, and every 30 minutes on Sundays. Northbound there are six trains an hour to , four of which extend to and two through to the terminus at . Southbound there are six trains per hour to Longbridge and three through to . Sunday trains run the full length of the route (except at beginning & end of service). The three southbound trains each hour that previously terminated at Longbridge were extended to from Summer 2018 once the Barnt Green to Bromsgrove section electrification was completed.Bromsgrove Corridor resignalling Rail Engineer news article 17 January 2017; Retrieved 9 June 2018 References *An Historical Survey Of Selected LMS Stations Vol. One Dr R Preston and R Powell Hendry.

Its population in 2016 was 1,433. It is also the francophone centre of the otherwise largely (57%) anglophone Pontiac MRC, with 79.6% listing French as their mother tongue in the Canada 2006 Census. Fort-Coulonge is known for the Félix-Gabriel- Marchand Bridge, Quebec's longest covered bridge which is actually in neighbouring Mansfield-et-Pontefract. DemographicsHistory Historic locations of Fort Coulonge. In the late 17th century the site was occupied, perhaps intermittently, by members of the d'Ailleboust family, who used \\"sieur de Coulonge\\" as a title. Accounts differ: the Commission de toponymie du Québec mentions Nicholas d'Ailleboust de Manthet, who wintered in that location in 1694; Elizabeth Browne Losey says it was founded by the d'Ailleboust family 'as early as 1650'. With the fall of New France it was abandoned. In 1784, the site was re-occupied when the North West Company built a fort, named Fort Coulonge. When the Hudson's Bay Company took over in 1821 it continued to be supplied from Montreal. Until 1828 it was the head trading post on the Ottawa River. The post engaged in farming, as well as trading with the indigenous Ojibwe and Algonquins. After 1830, as the area became more settled, it became more like a general store. The post's farm was sold in 1844. In 1855 the surviving store was sold to Thomas Taylor, its last clerk. The buildings were still standing in 1873 but by 1892 they had burned down.Elizabeth Browne Losey, \\"Let Them be Remembered:The Story of the Fur Trade Forts\\", 1999. The trading post became the village of Fort-Coulonge situated several kilometres down river, when in 1843, the region's first sawmill was built by George Bryson Sr.. This was the impetus that led to permanent settlement and the formation of the village. Two year later in 1845, the mission of Saint-Pierre-de-Fort-Coulonge was established, followed by the Presbyterian parish of St. Andrews in 1863. Its post office opened in 1853. By the mid 1860s, the town had a population of about 500. The first wooden chapel was built in 1873. It was destroyed by fire and replaced by a brick church in 1884. In 1886, the Pontiac Pacific Junction Railway reached Fort-Coulonge. Fort-Coulonge became a municipality in 1888 when it separated from the Township Municipality of Mansfield. John Bryson, son of George Bryson, was the first mayor. The lumber industry continued to drive the growth of Fort- Coulonge in the 1890s and early 20th century. The many logging camps in the Ottawa Valley created a big demand for accommodation in the town; by the 1890s there were at least 5 hotels. The town's mills produced thousands of feet of cut lumber, as well as pulp wood. In passenger rail service to Fort-Coulonge ended in 1958, and cargo traffic ended in 1977.

Together with Václav Havel, Zdeněk Mlynář, and Pavel Kohout, Hájek was one of the founding members and architects of Charter 77. Early political career Hájek studied and worked as a lawyer. From a young age he was a member of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party. During World War II Hájek was imprisoned (1939–1945). After the war he became a member of parliament for the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party (1945–1948) and probably also a secret member of the Communist Party (code name E-22). During 1948 – 1969 he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, during 1950 – 1953 he was the rector of the University of Economics. Diplomacy From 1955 Hájek worked in diplomacy: in 1955–1958 as an ambassador in Britain, in 1958–1962 as a deputy of the minister of foreign affairs, and in 1962–1965 he represented Czechoslovakia in United Nations. Between 1965 and 1968 he was the minister of education. From April to September 1968, he served as the minister of foreign affairs in Dubček's government. After the Soviet Union army took control over Czechoslovakia (21 August 1968) he protested against this in a speech at the United Nations (where he used the word occupation) – this caused his dismissal from high offices and even from the communist party (1970). Charter 77 Until 1973 Hájek worked in the Historical Institute of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Together with Václav Havel, Zdeněk Mlynář, and Pavel Kohout, Hájek was one of the founding members and architects of Charter 77. Jiří Hájek emerged as one of three leading spokesmen of Charter 77, thus becoming the target of police interrogations and threats. He was a strong defender of this uncompromising document, which voiced the principles of universal human rights. In 1987, Hájek was awarded the first ever Professor Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize. After the fall of socialism in Czechoslovakia (1989) Hájek served as an advisor of Alexander Dubček (1990–1992) but was unable to obtain significant political influence. Death He died of an unspecified cancer on 22 October 1993.

Pan- adaptationism is the strong form of this, deriving from the early 20th century modern synthesis, that all traits are adaptations, a view now shared by few biologists. Adaptationists perform research to try to distinguish adaptations (e.g., the umbilical cord) from byproducts (e.g., the belly button) or random variation (e.g., convex or concave shape of the belly button). George Williams' Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966) was highly influential in its development, defining some of the heuristics used to identify adaptations. Criteria to identify a trait as an adaptation Adaptationism is an approach to studying the evolution of form and function. It attempts to frame the existence and persistence of traits, assuming that each of them arose independently and improved the reproductive success of the organism's ancestors. A trait is an adaptation if it fulfils the following criteria: # The trait is a variation of an earlier form. # The trait is heritable through the transmission of genes. # The trait enhances reproductive success. Constraints on the power of evolutionGenetic constraints= Genetic reality provides constraints on the power of random mutation followed by natural selection. With pleiotropy, some genes control multiple traits, so that adaptation of one trait is impeded by effects on other traits that are not necessarily adaptive. Selection that influences epistasis is a case where the regulation or expression of one gene, depends on one or several others. This is true for a good number of genes though to differing extents. The reason why this leads to muddied responses is that selection for a trait that is epistatically based can mean that an allele for a gene that is epistatic when selected would happen to affect others. This leads to the coregulation of others for a reason other than there is an adaptive quality to each of those traits. Like with pleiotropy, traits could reach fixation in a population as a by-product of selection for another. In the context of development the difference between pleiotropy and epistasis is not so clear but at the genetic level the distinction is more clear. With these traits as being by-products of others it can ultimately be said that these traits evolved but not that they necessarily represent adaptations. Polygenic traits are controlled by a number of separate genes. Many traits are polygenic, for example human height. To drastically change a polygenic trait is likely to require multiple changes. =Anatomical constraints= Anatomical constraints are features of organism's anatomy that are prevented from change by being constrained in some way. When organisms diverge from a common ancestor and inherit certain characteristics which become modified by natural selection of mutant phenotypes, it is as if some are traits are locked in place and are unable to change in certain ways. Some textbook anatomical constraints often include examples of structures that connect parts of the body together though a physical link. These links are hard if not impossible to break because evolution usually requires that anatomy be formed by small consecutive modifications in populations through generations. In his book, Why We Get Sick, Randolph Nesse uses the \\"blind spot\\" in the vertebrate eye (caused by the nerve fibers running through the retina) as an example of this. He argues that natural selection has come up with an elaborate work-around of the eyes wobbling back-and-forth to correct for this, but vertebrates have not found the solution embodied in cephalopod eyes, where the optic nerve does not interrupt the view. See also: Evolution of the eye. Another example is the cranial nerves in tetrapods. In early vertebrate evolution, sharks, skates, and rays (collectively Chondrichthyes), the cranial nerves run from the part of the brain that interprets sensory information, and radiate out towards the organs that produce those sensations. In tetrapods, however, and mammals in particular, the nerves take an elaborate winding path through the cranium around structures that evolved after the common ancestor with sharks. Debate with structuralism Adaptationism is sometimes characterized by critics as an unsubstantiated assumption that all or most traits are optimal adaptations. Structuralist critics (most notably Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould in their \\"spandrel\\" paperStephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin. \\"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme\\" Proc. Roy. Soc. London B 205 (1979) pp. 581–598) contend that the adaptationists have over-emphasized the power of natural selection to shape individual traits to an evolutionary optimum. Adaptationists are sometimes accused by their critics of using ad hoc \\"just-so stories\\". The critics, in turn, have been accused of misrepresentation (Straw man argumentation), rather than attacking the actual statements of supposed adaptationists. Adaptationist researchers respond by asserting that they, too, follow George Williams' depiction of adaptation as an \\"onerous concept\\" that should only be applied in light of strong evidence. This evidence can be generally characterized as the successful prediction of novel phenomena based on the hypothesis that design details of adaptations should fit a complex evolved design to respond to a specific set of selection pressures. In evolutionary psychology, researchers such as Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, and David Buss contend that the bulk of research findings that were uniquely predicted through adaptationist hypothesizing comprise evidence of the methods' validity. Purpose and function There are philosophical issues with the way biologists speak of function, effectively invoking teleology, the purpose of an adaptation. =Function= To say something has a function is to say something about what it does for the organism. It also says something about its history: how it has come about. A heart pumps blood: that is its function. It also emits sound, which is considered to be an ancillary side- effect, not its function. The heart has a history (which may be well or poorly understood), and that history is about how natural selection formed and maintained the heart as a pump. Every aspect of an organism that has a function has a history. Now, an adaptation must have a functional history: therefore we expect it must have undergone selection caused by relative survival in its habitat. It would be quite wrong to use the word adaptation about a trait which arose as a by-product. It is widely regarded as unprofessional for a biologist to say something like \\"A wing is for flying,\\" although that is their normal function. A biologist would be conscious that sometime in the remote past feathers on a small dinosaur had the function of retaining heat, and that later many wings were not used for flying (e.g. penguins, ostriches). So, the biologist would rather say that the wings on a bird or an insect usually had the function of aiding flight. That would carry the connotation of being an adaptation with a history of evolution by natural selection. =Teleology = Teleology was introduced into biology by Aristotle to describe the adaptedness of organisms. Biologists have found the implications of purposefulness awkward as they suggest supernatural intention, an aspect of Plato's thinking which Aristotle rejected. Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (first lecture) Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (second lecture) A similar term, teleonomy, was suggested by Colin Pittendrigh in 1958; it grew out of cybernetics and self-organising systems. Biologists of the 1960s such as Ernst Mayr, George C. Williams and Jacques Monod used it as a less loaded alternative. However, the discomfort remains. On the one hand, adaptation is obviously purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not. On the other hand, biologists want to deny conscious purpose in evolution. The dilemma gave rise to a famous joke by the evolutionary biologist Haldane: \\"Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.'\\" David Hull commented that Haldane's mistress \\"has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it. The only concession which they make to its disreputable past is to rename it 'teleonomy'.\\" See also * Adaptive evolution in the human genome * Beneficial acclimation hypothesis * Evolutionary failure * Exaptation * Gene-centered view of evolution * Vitalism ReferencesSources     * * External links *Information from \\"Deep Ethology\\" course website, by Neil Greenberg *Tooby & Cosmides comments on Maynard Smith's New York Review of Books piece on Gould et al.

The station was used by scheduled passenger trains between 1838 and 1854 when it was the terminus for both the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway, with lines to London, Manchester and Liverpool respectively. Excursion trains ran until 1893 after which only goods trains operated until closure in 1966. More recently, the surviving Grade I listed entrance building was used for occasional art events. In 2010, a new station, partly on the site of the historical Curzon Street station, was proposed as the Birmingham terminus for High Speed 2. In 2017 plans were approved to redevelop the remaining Grade 1 listed building to turn it into a visitor centre and office space for HS2 and other organisations. HS2 hopes to use the station as the hub for its high-speed line linking London and Birmingham – although these plans are still being developed. History The station, originally known as 'Birmingham' station was opened on 24 June 1838, with the first train from London to Birmingham arriving on 17 September. It was the terminus for both the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway and the companies had adjacent, parallel platforms but there were no through trains. 1838 drawing of the rear of the station's platforms while in operation. The Grand Junction Railway arrived at Curzon Street in 1839. Although the line had opened in 1837, one year before the London and Birmingham Railway, it originally ran to a temporary terminus at Vauxhall. A viaduct had to be constructed to allow the line to reach Curzon Street.Osborne, E.C.; W. Osborne (1838). Osborne's guide to the Grand Junction, or Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester Railway. pp. 101–2. The smaller Lawley Street station, terminus of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway (a forerunner of the Midland Railway) was later opened a short distance to the east. Behind the main entrance building, the L&B; station had a wrought iron framed trainshed which had two spans, and covered an area 217 feet (66 metres) long and 113 feet (34 metres) wide. It had two platforms, one for departures and one for arrivals. The Grand Junction Railway had parallel departure and arrivals platforms and a separate entrance building and booking office (now demolished) further along Curzon Street, designed by Joseph Franklin. A 1910 Railway Clearing House map showing railways in the vicinity of Curzon Street (upper centre) Its use as a major passenger station was short lived. It was inconveniently located on the eastern edge of Birmingham city centre, and the station's facilities soon became overwhelmed by the growing traffic. Following the merging of the L&B; and Grand Junction railways into the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846, work started on the new and more conveniently located 'Grand Central' station, which would become known as Birmingham New Street half a mile to the west. shared with the Midland Railway, New Street was completed in 1854. Most passenger services were diverted to the new station the same year. The name of the station had been changed from 'Birmingham' to 'Birmingham Curzon Street' in November 1852. Part of the overall site (at the corner of New Canal Street and Banbury Street) was modified in 1874 and used from that Easter as an 'excursion station' (to relieve New Street at peak times such as holidays or fair days), used notably by public holiday excursion services to Sutton Coldfield, until Easter 1893 (the 1838 platforms were not so used). The main site continued in use as a goods station until 1966. The platforms, along with the original trainsheds were demolished the same year. The site was then used as a Parcelforce depot until May 2006. The surviving entrance building The surviving entrance building, in 2006 The surviving Grade I listed entrance building was designed by Philip Hardwick as the company’s offices and boardroom. Built in 1838, it is among the world's oldest surviving pieces of monumental railway architecture. Costing £28,000 to build, the architecture is Roman inspired, following Hardwick's trip to Italy in 1818–19. It has tall pillars running up the front of the building, made out of a series of huge blocks of stone. The design mirrored the Euston Arch at the London end of the L&BR.; In the original design the building was to be flanked by two arches leading into the station: excavations have revealed that these were never built. The interior was modified in 1839 to accommodate an 'hotel' (the Victoria), although this was probably more in the nature of a refreshment room or public house, and later the booking hall, with a large iron balustraded stone staircase and offices. It is three storeys tall but relatively small. The building was acquired by Birmingham City Council in 1979. A detailed paper from Historic England can be found at the Warwickshire Railways website.. In 1841 an hotel extension - known originally as the Queen's Hotel - was added to the northern (Curzon Street) side of the building, but was eclipsed (and renamed the Railway Hotel) when a new Queen's Hotel was opened next to New Street station. The Railway Hotel closed in June 1900 Birmingham Daily Post of 7 June 1900 carried advertisement for sale of contents upon expiry of tenancy for conversion to railway offices and was demolished ca. 1980 by Birmingham City Council. On 27 January 1847, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was established with George Stephenson as its first president in the Queen's Hotel; a plaque commemorating the centenary of the event was placed inside the station building when the hotel was demolished. Ansells Brewery had a purpose built public house built opposite the station in 1897. This was called The Woodman and it is still open in 2020. Hardwick's station building was acquired by Birmingham City Council in 1979. and was used by a University of Birmingham student theatre group, the 'Three Bugs Fringe Theatre'. The building was also proposed as a home for the Royal College of Organists, but the proposal foundered in 2005 for lack of funds. A Parcelforce depot to the rear of the station was demolished in May 2006. A commemorative plaque was installed next to the station entrance in 1988 which reads: \\"THIS PLAQUE COMMEMORATES THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM TRAIN AT THIS STATION ON MONDAY 17TH SEPTEMBER 1838\\". The building is unused except for the occasional art exhibition. Birmingham City Council had hoped to refurbish the building and find an alternative tenant. It was expected to be the centrepiece of the City Park and Masshouse development scheme, which is located around the site, most of the surrounding buildings having been demolished. These plans have been overshadowed by the High Speed 2 proposal. The new station might have incorporated the surviving entrance building High Speed 2 Feasibility study, Water Orton Corridor: Fazely Street Station, Plan Profile Sheet 7 of 7 Department for Transport (2010a), page 115 but the latest plan leaves the building outside the HS2 station's footprint.

Here the \\"Kit-Kat portraits\\" hung;Victoria County History: Surrey, vol. 4: Barnes; Harry M. Geduld, Prince of publishers: a study of the work and career of Jacob Tonson, 1969. Tonson's extensions to the house, c1703, seem to have been made under the general advice of John Vanbrugh, a Kit-Kat member.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Vanbrugh, John\\". During Tonson's tenure, John Hughes wrote a poetical description of sunrise in \\"Barn-Elms\\": > Let Phoebus his late happiness rehearse, > And grace Barn-Elms with never-dying verse !... > Ye verdant Elms, that towering grace this grove > Be sacred still to Beauty and to Love ! John James Heidegger, the opera impresario, resided at Barn Elms, where he entertained George II, and as Heidegger's guest Georg Friederich Handel stayed here at his first arrival in England, in 1711.Barrett 1884:27. The house was later remodelled or rebuilt for Sir Richard Hoare, who died at Barn Elms,George Lipscomb, The History and Antiquities of the county of Buckingham 4, 1847:390 and enlarged in the early 19th century by his son, Richard Colt Hoare. When Hammersmith Bridge was erected in 1824–27, the company that undertook the work bought Barn Elms and drove the access road, Upper Bridge Road, now Castelnau, across the park.Victoria County History: Surrey, vol. 4: Barnes The house was also the home of Sir Lancelot Shadwell, who was Vice Chancellor of England in the 19th century: on one occasion he delivered an injunction while up to his neck in the cool lake.Barrett: 1884:29f. From 1883 to 1939 Barn Elms was used as the club-house of the Ranelagh Club,They were removed from Ranelagh Ground, Fulham (Barrett 1884:33) with polo grounds and extensive gardens. More recently the site was the home of Ham Polo Club. Over 100 years ago it hosted Fulham F.C. home games. In 1891 Barn Elms for a short time played host to Queens Park Rangers. The club was forced to move there after it became impossible to play soccer at their home ground in Brondesbury which was shared with London Scottish rugby club.Macey, Gordon The Official History of Queens Park Rangers Football Club (London : Queens Park Rangers F.C, 1999) The house became derelict and was demolished following a fire in 1954.C.

Conway. Cf. pp.141-142 (Alternative source for book at Internet Archive in various formats) Usage Listed chronologically: =By Aeschylus= The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus uses the maxim \\"know thyself\\" in his play Prometheus Bound. The play about a mythological sequence, thereby places the maxim within the context of Greek mythology. In this play, the demi-god Prometheus first rails at the Olympian gods, and against what he believes to be the injustice of his having been bound to a cliffside by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods. The demi-god Oceanus comes to Prometheus to reason with him, and cautions him that he should \\"know thyself\\".Aeschylus, Prometheys Bound, v. 309: γίγνωσκε σαυτὸν. In this context, Oceanus is telling Prometheus that he should know better than to speak ill of the one who decides his fate and accordingly, perhaps he should better know his place in the \\"great order of things.\\" =By Socrates= One of Socrates's students, the historian Xenophon, described some of the instances of Socrates's use of the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' in his history titled: Memorabilia. In this writing, Xenophon portrayed his teacher's use of the maxim as an organizing theme for Socrates's lengthy dialogue with Euthydemus.Xenophon describes Socrates use of 'Know Thyself' in Memorabilia 4.2.24 =By Plato= Plato, another student of Socrates, employs the maxim 'Know Thyself' extensively by having the character of Socrates use it to motivate his dialogues. Benjamin Jowett's index to his translation of the Dialogues of Plato lists six dialogues which discuss or explore the Delphic maxim: 'know thyself.' These dialogues (and the Stephanus numbers indexing the pages where these discussions begin) are Charmides (164D), Protagoras (343B), Phaedrus (229E), Philebus (48C), Laws (II.923A), Alcibiades I (124A, 129A, 132C).Plato, The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by Benjamin Jowett, M.A. in Five Volumes. 3rd edition revised and corrected (Oxford University Press, 1892), (See Index: Knowledge; 'know thyself' at Delphi). In Plato's Charmides, Critias argues that \\"succeeding sages who added 'never too much,' or, 'give a pledge, and evil is nigh at hand,' would appear to have so misunderstood them; for they imagined that 'know thyself!' was a piece of advice which the god gave, and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in; and they dedicated their own inscription under the idea that they too would give equally useful pieces of advice.\\"Critias states the meaning of 'know thyself' in Plato's Charmides (165a), In Critias' opinion 'know thyself!' was an admonition to those entering the sacred temple to remember or know their place and that 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same.Critias says 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same in Plato's Charmides (164e), In the balance of the Charmides, Plato has Socrates lead a longer inquiry as to how we may gain knowledge of ourselves. In Plato's Phaedrus, Socrates uses the maxim 'know thyself' as his explanation to Phaedrus to explain why he has no time for the attempts to rationally explain mythology or other far flung topics. Socrates says, \\"But I have no leisure for them at all; and the reason, my friend, is this: I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it seems to me ridiculous, when I do not yet know that, to investigate irrelevant things.\\"Socrates uses the saying 'know thyself' to explain what is important for him to know. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text%3DPhaedrus:section%3D229e In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates lauds the authors of pithy and concise sayings delivered precisely at the right moment and says that Lacedaemon, or Sparta, educates its people to that end. Socrates lists the Seven Sages as Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus, Myson, and Chilon, who he says are gifted in that Lacedaemonian art of concise words \\"twisted together, like a bowstring, where a slight effort gives great force.\\"Socrates lists the authors of Delphi's sayings. Socrates says examples of them are, \\"the far-famed inscriptions, which are in all men's mouths—'Know thyself,' and 'Nothing too much'.\\"Socrates seeks to understand 'Know thyself' as pithy, concise wisdom. Having lauded the maxims, Socrates then spends a great deal of time getting to the bottom of what one of them means, the saying of Pittacus, 'Hard is it to be good.' The irony here is that although the sayings of Delphi bear 'great force,' it is not clear how to live life in accordance with their meanings. Although, the concise and broad nature of the sayings suggests the active partaking in the usage and personal discovery of each maxim; as if the intended nature of the saying lay not in the words but the self-reflection and self-referencing of the person thereof. In Plato's Philebus dialogue, Socrates refers back to the same usage of 'know thyself' from Phaedrus to build an example of the ridiculous for Protarchus. Socrates says, as he did in Phaedrus, that people make themselves appear ridiculous when they are trying to know obscure things before they know themselves.Socrates use of 'Know thyself' in Philebus (48c) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Phileb.+48c&fromdoc;=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174 Plato also alluded to the fact that understanding 'thyself,' would have a greater yielded factor of understanding the nature of a human being. Syllogistically, understanding oneself would enable thyself to have an understanding of others as a result. =Later usage= Detail from the 6th edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae (1748). \\"HOMO. Nosce te ipsum.\\" The Suda, a 10th-century encyclopedia of Greek knowledge, states: \\"the proverb is applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are\\",'Know Thyself' as an admonition, in \\"Know Thyself\\".

Suda On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 . One work by the Medieval philosopher Peter Abelard is titled Scito te ipsum (“know yourself”) or Ethica. From 1539 onward, the phrase nosce te ipsum and its Latin variants were used in the anonymous texts written for anatomical fugitive sheets printed in Venice as well as for later anatomical atlases printed throughout Europe. The 1530s fugitive sheets are the first instances in which the phrase was applied to knowledge of the human body attained through dissection.William Schupbach, The Paradox of Rembrandt's \\"Anatomy of Dr. Tulp (Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine: London, 1982), pp. 67-68 In 1651, Thomas Hobbes used the term nosce teipsum which he translated as 'read thyself' in his famous work, The Leviathan. He was responding to a popular philosophy at the time that you can learn more by studying others than you can from reading books. He asserts that one learns more by studying oneself: particularly the feelings that influence our thoughts and motivate our actions. As Hobbes states, \\"but to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions.\\" In 1734, Alexander Pope wrote a poem entitled \\"An Essay on Man, Epistle II\\", which begins \\"Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is Man.\\"Alexander Pope begins his Essay on Man Epistle II \\"Know then thyself.\\". In 1735, Carl Linnaeus published the first edition of Systema Naturae in which he described humans (Homo) with the simple phrase \\"Nosce te ipsum\\". In 1750, Benjamin Franklin, in his Poor Richard's Almanack, observed the great difficulty of knowing one's self, with: \\"There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self.\\"Ben Franklin observes that it is extremely hard to know oneself. . In 1754, Jean- Jacques Rousseau lauded the \\"inscription of the Temple at Delphi\\" in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality. In 1831, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a poem titled \\"Γνώθι Σεαυτόν\\", or Gnothi Seauton ('Know Thyself'), on the theme of 'God in thee.' The poem was an anthem to Emerson's belief that to \\"know thyself\\" meant knowing the God that Emerson felt existed within each person.Ralph Waldo Emerson Gnothe Seauton, Poem 1831. . In 1832, Samuel T. Coleridge wrote a poem titled \\"Self Knowledge\\" in which the text centers on the Delphic maxim \\"Know Thyself\\" beginning \\"Gnôthi seauton!--and is this the prime And heaven-sprung adage of the olden time!--\\" and ending with \\"Ignore thyself, and strive to know thy God!\\" Coleridge's text references JUVENAL, xi. 27.Samuel T. Coleridge wrote the poem \\"Self Knowledge\\" discussing Gnôthi seauton or know thyself. . In 1857, Allan Kardec asks in The Spirits Book (question 919): \\"What is the most effective method for guaranteeing self- improvement and resisting the attraction of wrongdoing?\\" and obtains the answer from the Spirits \\"A philosopher of antiquity once said, \\"Know thyself. Allan Kardec, The Spirits Book. Question 919. . Acknowledging the wisdom of the maxim, he then asks about the means of acquiring self-knowledge, obtaining a detailed answer with practical instructions and philosophical-moral considerations. In 1902, Hugo von Hofmannsthal had his 16th-century alter ego in his letter to Francis Bacon mention a book he intended to call Nosce te ipsum. The Wachowskis used one of the Latin versions (temet nosce) of this aphorism as inscription over the Oracle's door in their movies The Matrix (1999)See occurrences on Google Books. and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). The transgender character Nomi in the Netflix show Sense8, again directed by The Wachowskis, has a tattoo on her arm with the Greek version of this phrase. \\"Know Thyself\\" is the motto of Hamilton College of Lyceum International School (Nugegoda, Sri Lanka) and of İpek University (Ankara, Turkey).ipek.edu.tr. The Latin phrase \\"Nosce te ipsum\\" is the motto of Landmark College. Nosce te ipsum is also the motto for the Scottish clan Thompson. It is featured on the family crest or coat of arms. =In other languages= In The Art of War, the maxim 知彼知己，百战不殆 means \\"know others and know thyself, and you will not be endangered by innumerable battles\\". In this saying by Sun Zi (孙子, Sun Tze), the idea of knowing thyself is paramount. A battle/challenge cannot be won if one does not understand his or her own strengths and weaknesses, which come into play during the preparedness and response required to avoid danger. Note, winning is not always the goal, simply not losing is the best method to avoid inciting the spirit of revenge. 知彼知己，百战不殆 See also * Delphic maxims * I know that I know nothing * Introspection * Jnana * Philosophy of self * Self-knowledge (psychology) * The Art of War  References External links * Gnothi sauton at Binghamton University * \\"The Examined Life\\", BBC Radio 4 discussion with A.C.

It lies 7 miles north-east of Belfast and 3 miles south-west of Carrickfergus. The town is on the coast of Belfast Lough and is named after a tiny islet to the west, the Green Island.http://www.betweentheknockaghandthelough.co.uk/HistoricalOverview.aspx Between the Knockagh and the Lough: Historical Overview It is a semi-rural community located at the foot of Carn Hill , upon which stands the Knockagh Monument, a war memorial for those from County Antrim who died in the first and second world wars. Discover Ireland: The Knockagh Monument The town has two distinct areas, known locally as Upper Greenisland and Lower Greenisland after the upper Station Road and lower Station Road around which two parts are respectively located. Upper Greenisland stretches from Upper Road (B90) to the railway station at the bottom of Upper Station Road, includes Greenisland Primary School and features predominantly middle-class demographics and housing. Lower Greenisland runs from the railway station, down Station Road and ends at Shore Road (part of the A2 road). It features a large, predominantly Protestant working-class housing estate built during the 1950s and 1960shttp://www.betweentheknockaghandthelough.co.uk/PresentDay.aspx Between the Knockagh and the Lough: Present Day and includes Greenisland Library, Greenisland Community Centre, a number of churches, a small shopping parade at Glassillan Court and Silverstream Primary School. The village in its entirety stretches from the foot of the hill to the shore of Belfast Lough. History Originally, the area now known as Greenisland was merely an unnamed area of the town of Carrickfergus with the Silverstream river, now the western boundary of Greenisland, marking the westernmost boundary of the large town. Today, roadsigns indicate that the river, which now flows through the grounds of Belfast High School, is the exact boundary between the Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey boroughs. From 1602 to 1606 the \\"freemen\\", leading citizens of Carrickfergus, obtained the right to redistribute this area of land from the Crown, renaming the area the West Division - a name which remains legal today. Farmland was distributed in strips from Knockagh Hill, to the shore of Belfast Lough and lanes were constructed to provide access to the farms and their houses, including important residences such as Castle Lugg. The most notable of these was Longfield Lane, which was eventually widened and surfaced to provide access to the railway station, becoming the Station Road. Many of the lanes also remain in their original narrow state, such as Neill's Lane and Windfield Lane both of which run north from the Shore Road on either side of Greenisland. In the 1800s, following the growth of Belfast towards the end of the 18th century, several bathing lodges used for summer recreation were established in the area. One such lodge is still standing today and has been transformed into \\"Ravenhill Nursing Home\\" by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.http://www.carehome.co.uk/carehome.cfm/searchazref/20007005RAVA Ravenhill Nursing Home During this period, Bassett's directory of 1888 notes that the area was \\"devoted entirely to handsome residences occupied for the greater part by gentlemen engaged in commercial and professional pursuits in Belfast\\". The Belfast-to-Ballymena railway line was opened in 1845, which travelled through the area, providing one of the first transport links to the town from both Belfast and Carrickfergus. The village was finally given the official name of Greenisland in 1893 when the Greenisland railway station was constructed in its present site. Improvements in transport and a growth in prosperity led to more semi-detached and terraced houses in the area immediately surrounding the railway station. In 1859, the Christian Revival that swept Ulster arrived in Greenisland and an open-air service was held in the field below Longfield Farm (now known locally as Johnstone Farm) which is still standing on the Station Road. By 1860 the interdenominational Ebenezer Hall was built for worshippers on the Shore Road. This was then followed in 1912 when the Presbyterian Knockagh Hall was built on the Upper Road. Neither of these buildings survive, but the congregations of these two churches remain. With Greenisland Ebenezer Church of the Nazarene now in Longfield Gardens and Greenisland Presbyterian Church on the Upper Road. Over the years they have been joined by several other churches as Greenisland has grown. Greenisland Primary School replaced a school in Trooperslane in 1938, when it was realised that children had to walk two miles to Trooperslane and back every day. On the opening day, pupils arrived at the Trooperslane school and then walked to the new school carrying armfuls of books, jars of ink and other learning materials. During World War II, the new school's headmaster, as an Army reservist, was called into action. Soon after, an air-raid shelter was built in the playground and gas masks were placed under desks, where the pupils would store their bags. Village residents formed a Home Guard and Civil Defence Post and air-raid drills became regular free 'entertainment' in the evenings. Stirrup pumps were issued to put out fires and proved very useful for watering gardens during the summer. The name on the outside of the school was covered during the war so that any German parachutists landing in Greenisland would be disorientated, not knowing where they were. In Easter 1941, when a German plane was reported to have flown up the Lough towards Belfast, the anti-aircraft battery on Neill's Lane opened fire. It was the only occasion during the war that necessitated the air-raid shelters in Greenisland. The guns did not bring down any aircraft and only managed to crack some windows in the village. However, it was soon realised that a full- scale attack had been waged on the city of Belfast (today known as the Belfast Blitz, the greatest loss of life outside London during the Blitz) and the village's Air Raid Precautions volunteers disappeared into Belfast for several days to help with the recovery. Local landmarks The Knockagh Monument, which overlooks Greenisland *The Knockagh Monument, a basalt obelisk erected as a memorial to the citizens of County Antrim who died during World War I and World War II. It sits at the summit of Carn Hill known locally as \\"Knockagh Hill\\", overlooking the village and is the most notable landmark of the surrounding area. *Castle Lugg, a site owned by the National Trust. The tower was described in the OS memoirs as \\"a square tower... nothing now remains but a portion of the N wall 27ft long & 25ft high - with a very small portion of the E side attached to it...There is no tradition or local record to throw any light on the origin, history or destruction of this castle\\". A small excavation was carried out at the site in 1980, but failed to establish a precise date of layout of the structure; documentary evidence suggest it existed by 1570. It is still much as it was when described in 1839, with the remains of the N wall, 8m long x 1.2m thick x c.5m high & a fragment of the E wall surviving at the NE corner. Two modern walls extend S from the E & W sides of the N wall & formed part of a forge. Shops and services Greenisland has a number of shops and services which include: grocery shops and newsagents, a petrol filling station, a butcher's shop, a golf club, a hair salon and a barber's shop, a bakery, a dental practice and doctors' surgery, a chemist, a number of takeaway food outlets and a nursing home formerly known as The Knockagh Lodge, an off-licence, car sales, a cafe and two children's nurseries. The area is also served by the local NEELB Library, and has a community centre, youth centre and Scout hall. Local help and advice Carrickfergus Citizens' Advice Bureau operates an outreach service which is available at Greenisland Baptist Church on Wednesdays from 12.30 - 1.30pm. (September–June Only). Christians Against Poverty (CAP) have also opened a centre at Greenisland Baptist Church which offers help and advice to anyone struggling with debt issues. Contact details for CAP can be found on the Greenisland Baptist Church website. Transport Greenisland railway station, opened on 11 April 1848, provides direct rail links in both the Belfast and Larne directions, from around 5am until 11pm. The vast majority of train services from the Belfast and Larne directions stop at Greenisland, with the exception of occasional express Belfast to Carrickfergus services. The vast majority of Ulsterbus Belfast and Carrickfergus/Whitehead bus services take a ten-minute detour into the Greenisland estate before continuing to their destination, providing the village with frequent transport links in each direction. Education * Greenisland Primary School is the primary education establishment in the village, located on the Upper Station Road. * Silverstream Primary School is the second primary school in the area, and is located in the estate area in the south of Greenisland. * Belfast High School is a grammar school located to the west of the village. * The Jordanstown campus of the University of Ulster is less than a mile from Greenisland. Sports clubs Greenisland has a number of sports clubs and facilities including Greenisland Golf Club, Greenisland Bowling Green, Greenisland War Memorial Sports Club (GWMSC), Greenisland Ladies Hockey Club, Greenisland Boys Football Club, Knockagh View Equestrian Centre, Knockagh Wrestling Club. Politics Greenisland was part of Carrickfergus Borough Council but is now part of the much larger Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and forms part of the Knockagh district electoral area. It is also in the East Antrim Westminster and Assembly constituencies. Demography On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 5,486 people living in Greenisland, an increase of 8.6% on the Census 2001 figure of 5,050. Of these: *19.1% were aged under 16 years and 17.4% were aged 65 and over *48.8% of the population were male and 51.2% were female *11.1% were from a Catholic background and 77.6% were from a Protestant or other Christian background. *4.2% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed. Recent developmentsWidening of A2 Shore Road= There have been multiple attempts and campaigns since the 1970s for the A2 Shore Road bottleneck to be removed and a dual carriageway to be built. Each made varying amounts of progress with plans and purchasing of property but were later abandoned for various reasons. Proposals began to re-emerge around 2005 for the introduction of a new multimillion-pound dual carriageway along the A2 Shore Road. In preparation for this, public consultations were conducted and relevant properties purchased. Conor Murphy the then Regional Development Minister stated in June 2010 that subject to \\"finances being available, delivery is expected to start in 2011-12, and the project should be completed in 2013\\". This was then further delayed until finances could be found. On 14 February 2012 it was confirmed in a press conference at Stormont by Edwin Poots, Martin McGuinness, Peter Robinson and Danny Kennedy that \\"£57m (would) be spent on improving the A2 Carrickfergus to Belfast road.\\" On 31 January 2013 the contract for the widening of the A2 shore road was awarded to Graham Construction.

He has also written scripts for television programmes, and he has acted in dramas and soap operas.  Biography  Peter was born in Walsall in the West Midlands in 1946. His name at the time of his birth was Peter Frederick George Cook. His father Arthur Cook was a gardener and his mother Grace worked for the local Police. Whilst attending the Edward Shelley School in Walsall, he took part in a school play and this inspired him to become an actor. He trained at the Birmingham School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art between 1962-65. On leaving college his first job was with the Unicorn Children's Theatre, touring the north of England and Scotland, finally being based at the New Arts Theatre club in London. Due to the existence of the comedian Peter Cook, Peter changed his professional name to Peter Corey. He later changed his name by deedpoll, having apparently become confused by having two surnames. After working in a number of repertory theatres, including Crewe for two years, he was appointed Young People's Theatre Director at The Connaught Theatre, Worthing. It was at Worthing where he first started writing plays. He then took a similar role at the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham, where he stayed for eight years. In 1981 he played the famous comedian Tony Hancock in a TV play that he wrote himself for BBC2. He spent several years working with the Junior Television Workshop at Central (later Carlton) Television in Nottingham. This led to him writing TV scripts and books, including TV versions of his book series 'Coping with ..' which won several awards. Peter continues to act and write, as well as touring the world talking about his work and providing writing and acting workshops. He also works as a stand-up comedian. He has worked extensively with learndirect as a writer, and has contributed titles to OUP's new reading scheme Project X. In 2009, he wrote a book for Qatar's National Day celebrations called 'The Pearl'. Twice married and divorced, Peter lives in Manston, Kent, where he teaches drama, acts, writes, works as a school governor and even writes the weekly quiz for his local pub.  Books  Peter has written 30 books to date, the most enduring (1989–2002) being his book series Coping With... which are designed to be useful, containing tips on how to 'Cope' with certain subjects as well as being amusing. Two distinguishing features of these books are: a complete A-Z of subjects (often with non-existent subjects for letters Q,V,X,Y and Z such as 'Zee end bit'), and heavy use of humorous footnotes, often with funny 'background information' about a subject. The titles in the series are (in order): *Coping With Parents (1989, ) *Coping With Teachers (1991, ) *Coping With Girls/ Boys (co-written with Kara May) (1992, ) *Coping With School (1993, ) *Coping With The Family (1994, ) *Coping With Pets (1995, ) *Coping With Friends (1996, ) *Coping With Love (1997, ) *Coping With Exams and Tests (1998, ) *Coping With The 21st Century (1999, ) *Coping With Christmas (1999, ) *Coping With Cash (2000, ) *Coping With 1999 (a diary) His other books include The A-Z of Absolutely Everything, The Life and Times of Cristóbal Colón; Columbus Exposed (a semi-accurate biography of Christopher Columbus, 1992, ), Palace Hill the Book (A book version of the Palace Hill TV series) and The Number 73 annual (An annual of a TV series, 1985). More recently he has written a book for the American market - \\"Running for the bus\\", plus two titles for the Oxford University Press reading scheme Project X. He has also written a number of projects for learndirect including one entitled did the river go?,which is aimed at adults and children with reading and numeracy issues.  Work on camera  Peter Corey is also an actor, featuring in dramas and soap operas. In Brookside, he played \\"Freddie Spence\\" for two years. He also featured in EastEnders for six months playing \\"Vic the Crusher\\", who was an extortionist. Peter also played Mr. Prout in One Foot in the Grave. His other roles include: *London's Burning *Hornblower *Harry's Mad *Sooty Heights *The Bill *No Sweat Peter has also worked on camera with numerous comedians including Frank Skinner, Steve Coogan, Jack Dee and Richard Blackwood.  Work for the camera  Peter's Coping With Books have been transformed into a number of TV shows, starting as a one-off called \\"Coping with Grown-Ups\\" in 1994, followed by \\"Coping with Christmas\\" in 1995, and a six-part series; (Holidays, School, Cool, Relatives, Girls, Boys) over the 1997-1998 Christmas Holiday. He has written approximately 200 hours of Television, mostly for children. Among these have been several comedies, including: *Your Mother Wouldn't Like It (A children's sketch show) *Palace Hill (A comedy about the younger royals e.g. Princes William and Harry) *The Comedy Crowd (A one-off comedy sketch show) *Cue Gary (Observational sketch show) A large amount of his TV work has involved puppets. This has included: * The DJ Kat Show - Sky Television * Sooty Heights - Sooty Films and Granada Television * Rainbow Thames Television * ZZZap! - Writer for the 'Cuthbert Lilly' Sketches - The Media Merchants  Work on stage  Peter began writing in the early 70s and has since written over 40 stage plays. These include a musical adaptation of Spike Milligan's Badjelly the Witch.  Awards  His Coping With... series led to the creation eight TV programmes that have helped Peter win four BAFTAs, the Prix Jeunesse, a Writers Guild award, and a Bronze Apple.

While the indices have been created for their humorous value, their general concepts can be applied in other fields like risk management.  Baez's crackpot index  The method, proposed semi-seriously by mathematical physicist John C. Baez in 1992, computes an index by responses to a list of 36 questions, each positive response contributing a point value ranging from 1 to 50. The computation is initialized with a value of −5. An earlier version only had 17 questions with point values for each ranging from 1 to 40. Presumably any positive value of the index indicates crankiness. Though the index was not proposed as a serious method, it nevertheless has become popular in Internet discussions of whether a claim or an individual is cranky, particularly in physics (e.g., at the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics), or in mathematics. Chris Caldwell's Prime Pages has a version adapted to prime number research which is a field with many famous unsolved problems that are easy to understand for amateur mathematicians.

Their special shape combined with the huge variety of glass types (like borosilicate, flint, aluminosilicate, soda lime, lead or quartz glass), allows the use of glass tubing in many applications. For example, laboratory glassware, lighting applications, solar thermal systems and pharmaceutical packaging to name the largest.Boltres, B. : When Glass meets Pharma, 1. Auflage, ECV Editio Cantor, 2015, In the past, scientists constructed their own laboratory apparatus prior to the ubiquity of interchangeable ground glass joints. Today, commercially available parts connected by ground glass joints are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available glass tubes by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large glass tubes, connected by stopcocks and smaller glass tubes, which are further connected to plastic hoses. Industrial Relevance Compared to other materials like plastics the importance of cylindrical half-finished products in glass is high. Main reasons are the difficulty associated with 3-d forming of glass in general. In order to create hollow objects from glass the cylinder shape is a natural starting material. Cylindrical glass tubes have: • the lowest surface area and most compact design • highest mechanical strength against pressure and impact • automated further processing due to symmetry. http://www.ilpi.com/glassblowing/index.html Compared to moulded glass ware the process of tube drawing achieves: • better optical clarity • more homogeneous distribution of wall thickness • higher precision or volume and geometry in general History Until the 19th century glass tubes were exclusively produced by mouth blowing, thus discontinuously manufactured from a batch or a glass melt. In 1912, E. Danner (Libbey Glass Company) developed the first continuous tube drawing process in the US, which works in horizontal direction. In 1918 he received a patent. In 1929 a vertical drawing process was developed by L. Sanches-Vello in France. Manufacturing Process Glass tubes are produced in various types of glass and in diameters ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters. In most production processes, an \\"infinitely long\\" glass tube is drawn directly from the melt, from which approximately 1.5 m long pieces are chopped off after passing a roller track up to the drawing machine. Production line for vertical tube drawing, right hand: glass tube in free sag, roller track, drawing machine and take-off device, packaging The three common methods differ regarding the drawing direction: = Drawing direction horizontal = Danner process  Cut through a Danner-tube drawing - blue: rotating Danner pipe with engine and blow-air connection, orange: liquid glass and drawing direction Danner drawing-muffle in the VEB glass factory Weißwasser In the Danner process, the molten glass runs from the feeder as a belt onto an obliquely downwardly inclined, rotating ceramic hollow cylinder, the Danner pipe. Through the hollow pipe, compressed air is blown to prevent the glass tube from collapsing. At the tip of the pipe the so-called drawing onion is formed, from which the glass tube is drawn off in the free sag on a horizontal pulling line. If the drawing speed is kept constantly, an increase in the blow pressure causes larger diameters and smaller wall thicknesses; With this method, tube diameters between 2 and 60 mm can be realized:  Vello process  Cut through a Vello tube - blue: mandrel with blown air connection, orange: liquid glass and drawing direction In the Vello process, the glass runs through an annular slot from the bottom of the feeder. This slot is formed between the round outlet nozzle of the feeder and a height-adjustable hollow needle (also a mandrel). Here, the tube is \\"inflated\\" with compressed air as well. The glass tube which initially emerges in the vertical direction is then deflected into the horizontal position in the free sag. The nozzle mandrel must be adjusted eccentrically to the drawing nozzle in order to avoid uneven wall thicknesses. Therefore, the resulting tube initially has different wall thicknesses, which balance out after the bending. With this method, tube diameters between 1.5 and 70 mm can be generated; The throughput is higher than it would have been with the Danner method. Furthermore, it is possible here to use glasses with highly volatile components, such as borates (borosilicate glass) and lead oxides (lead glass), since the temperatures at the drawing nozzle are lower than in the Danner muffle. Without a needle, glass rods can also be produced, whereby the diameter being adjusted via the nozzle as well as the drawing speed. Due to the vertical glass exit, down-draw processes are sporadically also listed under the general term \\"Vello\\", although there is no forcible deflection into the horizontal. Danner and Vello processes are used for the production of thin-walled glass tubes of relatively small diameter, with throughputs of up to 55 tonnes per day. The world record for the longest ever continuously drawn tube glass in one piece is 10 m hold by SCHOTT Tubing. = Drawing direction downwards (down-draw) = The down-draw method is, in principle, the same as the Vello method, although here the glass tube is not deflected but is pulled off in the vertical direction. In the down-draw, the current world record is held by SCHOTT Tubing with 460 mm.http://microsites.schott.com/glasstec2016/english/gtl/glass-tube- record.html The achievable wall thicknesses for large outer diameters above 250 mm is about 10 mm. Larger wall thicknesses of up to 15 mm are possible for smaller outer diameters only. For borosilicate glass (35 mm Durchmesser) a drawing speed of 0.3 m/min can be achieved. = Drawing direction vertically upwards (vertical drawing) = Here, the glass tube is not formed by a mandrel but is drawn off from the free bath surface. A nozzle protrudes from below into a drawing nozzle, via which the air is blown into the glass tube. The nozzle also holds the drawing onion so that it does not move out laterally. Since the quality and drawing speed achieved during the vertical tube drawing process are relatively low, this process has nowadays almost no practical significance. = Further procedures = Glass tubes with very large diameters (20 bis 100 cm), as required for plants of the chemical industry, are produced by centrifugation or blowing. However, only the production of relatively short tube sections of up to one meter, so-called tube shots, is possible. Modifying Many glass tubing can be used right away for example for pneumatic conveying systems, lighting, photobioreactors or as an architectural item. However, modifying of glass tubing is quite common and indespendsable for applications like laboratory glass, pharma packaging Swift, R., et al., Glass Containers for Parenteral Products, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications, S. Nema and J.D. Ludwig, Editors. 2019., and diode encapsulants. Here, the glass tubing needs to be e.g. cut, bended, or even converted into another shape (compare vial, syringes etc.). Mainly, this is done by applying heat to the sample and/or use a mechanic forming tool. Although modifying glass tubing is no longer an essential laboratory technique, many are still familiar with the basic methods. A glass cutter is used to break pieces of glass tubing into smaller pieces. Freshly cut edges are flame polished before use to remove the rough edge. Glass tubing can be bent by heating evenly over a Bunsen flame to red heat. Hose barbs can be added to tubing, giving a better grip and seal for attaching plastic or rubber tubing. Applications Glass tubes are not only produced in round shapes but also in various other shapes such as rectangular, triangular and star-like shape. Glass tubes, rods and profiles can be made from different glass types. They find use in a variety of markets such as pharmaceuticals, industrial and environmental technology as well as electronics. Glass tubes are processed in: * measuring cylinders * halogen lamps * pharmaceuticals packaging * fluorescent lamps * photobioreactors * Interior Design * Lighting concepts * product presentation * backlights * photo-flash lamps * pneumatic conveyor systems Manufacturers There are several companies concentrating on the production of glass tubes made from special glass types. By using a special glass type with particular properties the glass tubes can be fit for a variety of applications.

Other common names include red elm, gray elm, soft elm, moose elm, and Indian elm. The tree was first named as part of Ulmus americana in 1753, but identified as a separate species, Ulmus rubra, in 1793 by Pennsylvania botanist Gotthilf Muhlenberg. The slightly later name U. fulva, published by French botanist André Michaux in 1803,Michaux, A. (1803). Flora Boreali- Americana (\\"The Flora of North America\\") is still widely used in dietary- supplement and alternative-medicine information. The species superficially resembles American elm (U. americana), but is more closely related to the European wych elm (U. glabra), which has a very similar flower structure, though lacks the pubescence over the seed.Elwes, H. J. & Henry, A. (1913). The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland. Vol. VII. 1862-4 (as U. fulva). Republished 2004 Cambridge University Press, U. rubra was introduced to Europe in 1830. Description Ulmus rubra is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a spreading head of branches,Hillier & Sons. (1990). Hillier's Manual of Trees & Shrubs, 5th ed.. David & Charles, Newton Abbot, UK commonly growing to , very occasionally > in height. Its heartwood is reddish-brown, giving the tree its alternative common name 'red elm'. The species is chiefly distinguished from American elm by its downy twigs, chestnut brown or reddish hairy buds, and slimy red inner bark. The broad oblong to obovate leaves are long, rough above but velvety below, with coarse double-serrate margins, acuminate apices and oblique bases; the petioles are long.Bean, W. J. (1970). Trees & Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles, 8th ed., p. 656\\\\. (2nd impression 1976) John Murray, London. The leaves are often red tinged on emergence, turning dark green by summer, and then a dull yellow in the fall.Missouri Botanical Garden, Ulmus rubra The perfect, apetalous, wind-pollinated flowers are produced before the leaves in early spring, usually in tight, short-stalked, clusters of 10–20. The reddish-brown fruit is an oval winged samara, orbicular to obovate, slightly notched at the top, long, the single, central seed coated with red- brown hairs, naked elsewhere.

It occasionally appeared in early 20th-century US nursery catalogues.Frederick W. Kelsey, Descriptive catalogue, no. 55, N.Y., 1906 Introduced to Europe and Australasia, it has never thrived in the UK; Elwes & Henry knew of not one good specimen, and the last tree planted at Kew attained a height of only in 60 years. Specimens supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. fulva may survive in Edinburgh as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm). A specimen at RBGE was felled c.1990. The current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. Several mature trees survive in Brighton (see Accessions).

Cached p.33-35 Hybrid cultivars U. rubra had limited success as a hybrid parent in the 1960s, resulting in the cultivars 'Coolshade', 'Fremont', 'Improved Coolshade', 'Lincoln', 'Rosehill', and probably 'Willis'. In later years, it was also used in the Wisconsin elm breeding program to produce 'Repura' and 'Revera' although neither is known to have been released to commerce. In Germany, the tree formed part of a complex hybrid raised by the Eisele nursery in Darmstadt, provisionally named 'Eisele H1'; patent pending (2020).

It offers master's degrees in Global Affairs, Public Policy, European, Russian, and Asia-Pacific studies. The Munk School is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs, a group of schools that educate leaders in international affairs. Admission to the Munk School is highly competitive. History It was founded as the Munk Centre for International Studies in 2000 and named after Canadian businessman and philanthropist Peter Munk, who made a $6.4 million donation to finance the construction.news19971029 It occupies the historic Devonshire House, a former residential hall of the university's Trinity College, and in 2012 opened a second location at 315 Bloor Street West after an $80 million collective contribution from the Peter and Melanie Munk Foundation, the Government of Canada, and the Government of Ontario. The School is located in the north and south wings of the Devonshire House building on Devonshire Place, which is shared with Trinity College's John W. Graham Library. In 2012, the School opened its second location at the Observatory site at 315 Bloor Street West (formerly Admissions and Awards), which houses the offices of the Citizen Lab and the Master of Global Affairs program. The founding director was Janice Stein OC, who held the position until 2014. The school was then directed by Stephen Toope OC before he became the 346th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 2017. The current interim director is Randall Hansen, who is also the director of the School's Centre for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies. On April 6, 2018, the University of Toronto announced that the Munk School of Global Affairs would merge with the School of Public Policy and Governance to become the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.https://www.utoronto.ca/news/introducing-u-t-s-new-munk-school-global- affairs-and-public-policy The merger took effect on July 1, 2018. On November 12, 2019, Michael Sabia was announced as the Munk School's new head, starting in February 2020.Barron's accessed November 13, 2019 alt= AcademicsMaster of Global Affairs= The Munk School's Master of Global Affairs (MGA) program is a two-year interdisciplinary professional degree aimed at equipping students with an awareness of global and financial systems, global civil society, and global strategic and security issues. The program requires students to complete a relevant internship with an NGO, an international organization such as the UN or WTO, or at an embassy or consulate abroad. Admission to the MGA is highly selective and only 80 students are admitted each year. After a general first year of study, students specialize in one of three areas: :Global Economy and Markets :Global Civil Society :Global Institutions MGA students can also complete their degrees concurrently with an MBA at the Rotman School of Management or with a JD at the University Of Toronto Faculty Of Law. The Munk School and Sciences Po also offer a dual degree program between their respective MGA and Master in Public Policy (MPP) degrees. =Master of Public Policy= The Munk School's Master of Public Policy (MPP) program is a two-year professional degree, with a core curriculum emphasizing practical and applied dimensions of policymaking. Core courses include micro and macroeconomics, legal analysis, political science and quantitative methods for policy analysis. The curriculum also includes five electives, that allow students to bridge the spheres of domestic policy, law, and international policy. Invited visiting public sector leaders and external researchers bridge theory and practice, providing contact with senior professionals in government and the broader public, private and community sectors. Approximately 80 students are admitted each year. Second Year MPP students can compete for exchanges with partner institutions in Europe and Asia. Partner institutions include: * The Hertie School of Governance (Berlin) * Sciences Po's Paris School of International Affairs (Paris) * The Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (Singapore) * National Graduate Institute for Public Policy (Japan) In addition to the two-year course work students are required to complete an internship during the summer between the first and second year.

England and Wales, two constituent countries of the United Kingdom (UK), are policed by territorial police forces which are largely formed on a county basis. Historically, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the other two constituent countries of the UK, have had county police, although both countries now have unified national police services.  Sweden  Until the end of 2014, all of the 21 counties of Sweden had its own County Police Department. In 2015, Sweden merged all local police departments into a single police agency, dividing the country into seven police regions instead. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the police are made up of 45 territorial police forces and 3 special police forces. * In England, the police are divided into 39 regional forces, which all provide full services throughout their districts. * In Wales, the police are divided into 4 regional forces, which all provide full services throughout their districts. * In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the police are national forces, which provide full services. =Territorial police forces= Territorial police forces that have a presence at a regional and county level throughout the UK include: * Avon and Somerset Constabulary * Bedfordshire Police * Cambridgeshire Constabulary * Cheshire Constabulary * City of London Police * Cleveland Police * Cumbria Constabulary * Derbyshire Constabulary * Devon and Cornwall Police * Dorset Police * Durham Constabulary * Dyfed-Powys Police * Essex Police * Gloucestershire Constabulary * Greater Manchester Police * Gwent Police * Hampshire Constabulary * Hertfordshire Constabulary * Humberside Police * Kent Police * Lancashire Constabulary * Leicestershire Constabulary * Lincolnshire Police * Merseyside Police * Metropolitan Police * Norfolk Constabulary * North Wales Police * Northamptonshire Police * Northumbria Police * North Yorkshire Police * Nottinghamshire Police * Police Service of Northern Ireland * Police Scotland * South Wales Police * South Yorkshire Police * Staffordshire Police * Suffolk Constabulary * Surrey Police * Sussex Police * Thames Valley Police * Warwickshire Police * West Mercia Police * West Midlands Police * West Yorkshire Police * Wiltshire Police =Special police services= Special police services that have a presence at a national level throughout the UK include: * British Transport Police which is responsible for providing law enforcement for the transport services such as public trains, train stations, buses, bus stations & trams in the UK. * Civil Nuclear Constabulary which is responsible for providing law enforcement at or within 5 km of any relevant nuclear site and for nuclear materials in transit within the UK. * Ministry of Defence Police which is responsible for providing armed security and counter terrorism, as well as uniformed policing and investigative services to Ministry of Defence property, personnel, and installations throughout the UK. Others also include the Royal Military Police, Royal Navy Police, Royal Air Force Police and more. United States In the United States, the powers, duties, and even existence of county police forces vary widely depending on the state, and even on the particular county (parish in Louisiana) within a state. County police forces as autonomous entities are relatively rare and tend to exist only in metropolitan counties. Many states also have a sheriff's office which are usually formed on a county basis and traditionally carry out duties related to the functioning of the courts and legal system, such as service of process, executing legal writs, and protection for the local courthouse and its judges. Many state constitutions mandate that the position of sheriff be created, which leads many states to also give sheriffs the duties of a county police to avoid having overlapping departments with similar duties, leaving the sheriff as the exclusive law enforcement agency for a county. Some counties that previously had both a county police force and a sheriff's office have merged the two, leaving the sheriff in command of the unified force, as the sheriff derives his power directly from the constitution; the most prominent example of such a merger is the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department which is actually led by the county sheriff despite its name. County police tend to fall into three broad categories: *Full-service police departments, which provide the full spectrum of police services to the entire county, irrespective of local communities, and may provide contractual security police services to special districts within the county. **Hawaii has only county police; there are no local police. *Limited service police departments, which provide services to unincorporated areas of the county (and may provide services to some incorporated areas by contract), and usually provide contractual security police services to special districts within the county. *Restricted service police departments, which provide security police duties to county owned and operated facilities and parks. Some may also perform some road patrol duties on county built and maintained roads, and provide support to municipal police departments in the county. Note: County detectives, who are maintained in the northeastern states by county attorneys' offices, fall within this category. In the state of Louisiana, a county is known as a parish. In the state of Alaska, a county is known as a borough. The only borough in Alaska to have their own police department is North Slope Borough. =U.S. departments= There are 3,141 counties in the United States and some of the following county police departments are: A to M *Albemarle County Police Department, Albemarle County, Virginia -

Family Bintanath was likely born during the reign of her grandfather Seti I. Her mother was Isetnofret, one of the two most prominent wives of Ramesses II. Her name is Semitic, meaning Daughter of Anath, referring to the Canaanite goddess Anath. She had at least three brothers, Ramesses, Khaemwaset and Merneptah and a sister who was named Isetnofret after their mother.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. , p.170 Bintanath had a daughter who appears on the paintings in her tomb in the Valley of the Queens. She is unnamed there but according to Joyce Tyldesley it is possible that her name was also Bintanath and she married the next pharaoh, Merneptah. According to Tyldesley, a statue of Merneptah in Luxor mentions \\"the Great Royal Wife Bintanath\\", who is, possibly, this daughter, since it is unlikely that the older Bintanath married Merneptah when both of them were well over sixty. However, it is entirely possible that Bintanath never married Merenptah and used the \\"Great Royal Wife\\" title only because she was entitled to it due to her first marriage.Tyldesley, Joyce.

Bintanath is depicted in a scene on a pylon in Luxor dated to year 3 of Ramesses II. She is said to be the King's daughter of his body, and is the first in a procession of princesses. She is followed by Meritamen in this procession. Bintanath appears twice as a princess in Abu Simbel. Together with Nebettawy she flanks the southernmost colossus on the facade of the great temple. On one of the pillars inside the temple she is shown offering flowers to the goddess Anuqet.Kitchen, K.A., Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated & Annotated, Translations, Volume II, Blackwell Publishers, 1996 Bentanath became Great Royal Wife around the 25th year of her father's reign. During her time as queen she held many titles including hereditary princess, the great first one (iryt-p\`t-tpit-wrt), Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy), Great King’s Wife (hmt-niswt-wrt), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (hnwt-Shm’w -mhw), King’s Daughter (s3t-niswt), and eventually King’s Sister (snt- niswt).Grajetski Ancient Egyptian Queens: a hieroglyphic dictionary Golden House Publications. As (great) royal wife Bintanath appears on several statues of Pharaoh Ramesses II. She is depicted on a statue from the Sinai (BM 697), on two sandstone colossi found in Tanis, but probably originally from Pi- Ramesse, and on a statue from the south gate of the Ptah precinct in Memphis. A usurped Middle Kingdom statue from Heracleopolis depicts both Bintanath and her sister Meritamen, and a statue from Hermopolis depicts Bintanath and Henutmire (both as great royal wives). Bintanath is depicted on statues of her father at least three times in Karnak and Luxor, and she appears in statues in Wadi es-Sebua. Two family stelae show Bintanath with her immediate family. The Aswan rock stela shows Ramesses II, Isetnofret and Khaemwaset before the god Khnum, while in another register Bintanath appears with her brothers Ramesses and Merneptah. Another stela from West Silsila depicts Bint-Anath standing behind her mother Isetnofret and her father Ramesses II as the king offers Maat to the gods Ptah and Nefertem. Prince Khaemwaset stands in front of the king, while her brothers Ramesses and Merneptah are shown in a lower register. Death and burial Despite her being Ramesses' first daughter, she was actually one of the few children who outlived their long-lived father. She was depicted on a statue usurped by Merenptah.

Founded in 2002, Roxor works with developers of open source software to deploy games on a Linux-based hardware platform in the arcade and on multiple home consoles. Although their most well known product, In The Groove, is proprietary software, the developers regularly contribute code back to the open source project StepMania upon which In The Groove is based. Products Their first product was an arcade redemption version of Tux Racer, where tickets are dispensed based on how well the player collects fish while guiding Tux (the Linux penguin mascot) down one of four snow-covered hills. The sequel, Tux 2, featuring new characters and levels, is currently in market testing. Their second product was In The Groove, a series of games in the arcade dance game genre. Following the well-established practice of converting arcade systems via kits, Version 1.0 of In The Groove was released as an upgrade kit for existing arcade dance cabinets. Roxor Games then developed a PlayStation 2 version of In The Groove, which was the first game ever published by RedOctane in June 2005. In The Groove: PC/Mac was released in July 2006. Pump It Up: In The Groove 2 was released in June 2005 both as an upgrade kit and in a dedicated cabinet manufactured by Andamiro (hence the addition of the Pump It Up name). In The Groove 2 debuted on the arcade earnings chart of Replay Magazine in September 2005, and remained in the top 15 for over 23 months. It hit #1 in February 2006. However, following a lawsuit from Konami, the maker of Dance Dance Revolution, the series was acquired by them, and development for In The Groove 3 was halted prematurely. Roxor has not produced any rhythm games since, but a group of people who had developed In The Groove (including Kyle Ward and Chris Foy) formed \\"Fun In Motion\\" and continued working with Andamiro to produce a spinoff of their existing intellectual property instead, leading to the creation of Pump It Up Pro and its sequels. This group now operates as Step Revolution, LLC. Roxor's latest product is a driving game titled Road Rebel. It is a multiplayer car combat game featuring support for a wide variety of driving cabinets and network play. Road Rebel will be offered as both an upgrade kit and a dedicated cabinet. It is currently on market test with Namco's arcade division.

A vehicle is not supposed to pass a timepoint until the schedule time has arrived. These stops are contrasted with all other stops on a scheduled route, for which the transit agency does not explicitly schedule an arrival/departure time. These other stops occur between timepoint stops, so their scheduled times are implicitly between those of the timepoints though not explicitly defined. At minimum, nt allows regular passengers to estimate when a bus would get to a stop before or after a timepoint. The creation of digital schedules, and real-time geo-located apps has somewhat complicated the situation for agencies operating with timepoints. These apps usually ingest General Transit Feed Specification data, a widely used schedule data format, which often included times for every single stop on a route.

Coello is considered the last great Spanish painter of the 17th century. The son of Faustino Coello, a famous Portuguese sculptor, he was a court painter for Charles II. He worked on many churches and public buildings in Madrid, with his most famous work being in the sacristy of El Escorial, which is filled with portraits of priests and courtiers. Life and work Coello's Susana y los viejos at Museo de Arte de Ponce, Ponce, Puerto Rico Claudio Coello was of Portuguese parents, but was born at Madrid in 1642. He was there instructed in the art by Francisco Rizi, and executed while yet in that school an altar-piece for San Plácido at Madrid. His acquaintance with the court painter, Juan Carreño de Miranda, procured him the permission to visit the royal collection, where he made his greatest advance by studying the works of Titian, Rubens, and Van Dyck. His friendship with José Jiménez Donoso, under whom he studied at Rome, was not less advantageous for him. In conjunction with that artist he painted frescoes at Madrid and Toledo, and executed the Triumphal Arch for the entrance of the Queen, Maria Louisa of Orleans. By these paintings he became well known, and was employed by the Archbishop of Saragossa in 1683. He was made painter to Charles II, by whom he was employed in the Escorial. Coello was the last Spanish painter of eminence for some years, as from the time that Luca Giordano was summoned to Spain, the art sank gradually to its decay. Many excellent examples of his work are to be seen in the churches and convents in Madrid, Saragossa, and Salamanca. But his principal work is the famous altar-piece in the sacristy of San Lorenzo, in the Escorial, representing the 'Adoration of the Miraculous Host.' It is an immense composition, and occupied the painter seven years. In the crowd of personages that form the procession, are no less than fifty portraits, including those of the king and the principal persons of the court: it is painted with the utmost precision, yet in a bold and masterly style, and there is a majestic solemnity in the arrangement of the whole, which suits well to the grandeur of the subject. It is a very extraordinary performance, and holds its place even by the side of the works of Titian and Rubens. The preference which was given to Luca Giordano, who came to Madrid in 1692, in painting the grand staircase in the Escorial, mortified Coello so much that he died of vexation at Madrid in 1693. La Sagrada Forma, by Claudio Coello, El Escorial Coello etched three plates, viz. : — 'Christ on the Cross, with the Virgin, St. Augustine, and St. Monica,' and the portraits of Charles II and his Mother.

A replica of the aircraft is hung at the new Chep Lap Kok airport above the arrivals hall. Kai Tak and Chep Lap Kok Aerial view of Kai Tak in the 1970s Aerial view of the new airport in the 2010 The year 1924 was a critical point of aviation history of Hong Kong, when the story of Kai Tak began. The location of Kai Tak belonged to two billionaire friends Ho Kai and Au Tak, who owned the land before the government acquired the land (the land originally did not have a name), which explains the name of the airport. First planned as an estate site, the land was given to the government after the plan failed. It soon became a small airport for the Royal Air Force, flying clubs and pilot training centre. The first domestic airline company was set up in 1936. Later during the second World War, the runway was expanded. In 1962 the passenger terminal was completed, and Kai Tak became an international airport, renamed Hong Kong International Airport. But it continued to be referred to by its popular name, Kai Tak Airport. Within a couple of decades, it became clear that the current airport was inadequate. The airport itself was now surrounded by more private buildings, making further land acquisition and expansion impossible. To reduce the impact of noisy aircraft on nearby residents, there was a curfew in place. It was decided to look for a new area, which could fit a huge airport, built from scratch. In the early 90s, construction on a new airport outside the busy Hong Kong central area, began at Chep Lap Kok, 30 km to the west of Kai Tak. This new airport is built on reclaimed land and the reclamation process involved joining Lam Chau island with Chep Lap Kok island. The old airport at Kai Tak finally retired at midnight 5 July 1998, and the new Hong Kong International Airport and began service in the morning of the following day. Recently, a couple of new airport buildings were opened to help with the increasing number of travellers. There are many talks at present, to extend the current airport in the years to come. Many aviation enthusiasts were upset with the demise of Kai Tak because of the unique approach. As private aviation is not allowed at Chek Lap Kok, some enthusiasts had lobbied to keep around 1 km of the Kai Tak runway for private aviation; this was permitted for a while, but later on the Government recommended that a new cruise terminal at Kai Tak be built. In the meantime, a golf course was built at the end of the runway, this was later removed, to make way for cruise terminal construction equipment. Hong Kong International Airport handled some 73 million travellers in 2017. Just around 50% of them were coming to or from Hong Kong, while 20% were coming to or from surrounding areas in the Pearl River Delta, and 30% were transferred to other international or mainland flights. Around 2/3 of passengers are coming or going to the Mainland and Southeast and Northern Asia, with the rest on longer-haul routes. File:SpiritOfShaTinReplica3.jpgReplica of the Spirit of Sha Tin in Hong Kong International Airport  History  Before the 1950s = 1936 is a memorable year for Hong Kong commercial Aviation, the first commercial airline -Imperial Airline (British Airway) operated by DH-86A Propeller biplane departed from London via Marseille, Rome, Athens, Alexandra, Baghdad, Kuwait, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Penang, Saigon and finally arrived Hong Kong. Airplane Ticket price was 175 pound including hotel fee in each city, but this was a massive price at that time. During the same period, Pam Am Airline. \\"Hong Kong clipper\\" operated a route from San Francisco to Hong Kong. = 1950s to 1970s = On May 1st 1946, the Hong Kong civil aviation department was established and became a member of ICAO after it provided higher efficiency on flight control which increased airline capacity that attracted more airline settled routine to Hong Kong. September 20 of the same year, Cathay Pacific registered as the first Airline Company in Hong Kong. There were 13 airlines running a business at that period; China Airlines (Air China), Central Air Transport, Cathay Pacific, Philippine Airline, Asian Airline, British Airways, Pam Am Airline, Pacific International Airline, Macau Airline, Air France, Thai Airways, Varna Air- Siam. Due to competition, plane ticket price reduced. The highest Plane ticket price at that period was HKD 4211 from Hong to San Francisco. But this was still sky-pricing to most people. An international plane ticket could be a quarter of the price of a house. = 1970s to 1990s = Many factors were bursting Hong Kong airline industry, such as the transformation of economic, wide-body jet aircraft like the Boeing 747 & DC-10 and the new terminal in Kai Tak airport. According to the civil aviation department statistics, both passenger flights and cargo freight doubled from 1975 to 1985. Due to the 747 & DC-8 and more capacity of air routine allowance from ICAO, airline ticket prices reduced drastically. In 1980, Cathay Pacific, to obtain the freedom of air from London to Hong Kong, broke British Airways' monopoly, lowered the price to HKD 1000 as a quarter of original gave rise to traveling by plane.

The character is depicted as a member of the reality-hopping Exiles and formerly associated with New Excalibur. Fictional character biography Nocturne is from an alternative reality outside the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616). She is the daughter of that reality's Nightcrawler and the Scarlet Witch.Exiles #4 She is based on Jim Calafiore's \\"Professor W's X-Men\\" entry of the X-Men Millennial Visions 2000 one-shot. =Life in the X-Men= T.J. grew up around the X-Men and under her father's care, while her mother remains a member of the Avengers. Wolverine attacks Charles Xavier while under the control of the Shadow King. The Shadow King is expelled from Wolverine's mind, but Xavier is fatally wounded in the attack and Logan is left a cripple. Jean Grey dies shortly after the attack, and Cyclops blames Wolverine for both deaths and abandons the team. As a result, Wolverine and Nightcrawler take over as leaders of the X-Men and the Xavier Institute. Nocturne becomes an active member of the X-Men when she is seventeen years old, and has faced several of the team's most dangerous foes, including Apocalypse and a vengeance-seeking Cyclops. Nocturne saves Wolverine's life during Cyclops's attack by possessing her unconscious teammate Armageddon and using his telekinetic powers to move Wolverine's paralyzed arms to impale Cyclops.Exiles #42 =Exiles= At twenty years old, Nocturne is taken by the Timebroker and told she had become \\"unhinged from time.\\"Exiles #1 The Timebroker tells Nocturne that if she does not work to right the wrongs that have occurred in a multitude of alternate universes, her own timeline would remain altered and she would be returned to a universe in which Nightcrawler was murdered some time ago by his mother, Mystique. So Nocturne becomes a member of the reality-hopping Exiles. Over the course of the Exiles' first adventures, Nocturne develops a romantic relationship with teammate John Proudstar/Thunderbird, who is the former horseman, War, for his reality's Apocalypse. By the time the team is trapped for a month on a Skrull- dominated alternate Earth, Nocturne is pregnant with Thunderbird's child. However, John is horribly wounded during his efforts to repel Galactus during that mission, and is left behind when the team moves to the next reality.Exiles #8-10 Nocturne later miscarries the baby; it is unclear whether the miscarriage is natural, or whether she terminated the pregnancy herself. Although devastated by the loss of Thunderbird, Nocturne remains a competent member of the Exiles and eventually regains much of her sunny demeanor.Cover to Exiles #1. Nocturne is in the lower left corner. This is the first appearance of Nocturne on a cover to a comic book. Art by Mike McKone. Nocturne, and the Exiles, go to the main Marvel Universe where they meet the X-Men after Havok's cancelled wedding.Uncanny X-Men #425-426 The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the Mutant X universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the Mutant X Havok's consciousness. During this mission Nocturne meets this version of Nightcrawler, whom she accidentally calls \\"Dad\\" at first. The demeanor of the main Marvel Universe Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturne's reality, so the two develop a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.Exiles #28-30 After a few more missions the Exiles come back to the Marvel Universe, and are given a new teammate, Namora, and a new mission from the Tallus: \\"Leave your possessions and earn your wings\\". Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four eventually deciphered the mission's meaning: Beak of the X-Men has to go with the Exiles and Nocturne has to stay behind in the main Marvel Universe.Exiles #46-48 =Brotherhood/Return from Mojoworld= Nocturne then infiltrates Exodus' new Brotherhood, but is sucked into Xorn's head, along with several other members of the Brotherhood, while possessing Black Tom Cassidy.X-Men #161-164 She ends up in Mojoworld with Juggernaut (another Brotherhood mole), and is enslaved by Mojo. To escape, Nocturne takes control of Mojo's henchman, Spiral, and opens a portal to the X-Men's Danger Room, where they were reunited with the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #460 However, this is a trap set by Spiral who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turns the X-Men into X-Babies and sends his \\"Exile Legal Eagles\\" after them, but they manage to overpower his forces anyway. The group is re-aged, and Nocturne remains with the X-Men for the time being.Uncanny X-Men #461 =House of M= During the House of M reality, Nocturne is sought by Callisto's Marauders for having royal Magnus blood (because she is an alternate reality daughter of Scarlet Witch, a fact she doesn't remember due to her extradimensional origin which left her amnesiatic), but is protected by Psylocke and Marvel Girl. Marvel Girl allows Nocturne to possess her in order to keep her out of the Marauders' reach, but Nocturne ends up taking control, and in a confused daze, flies away. Psylocke pursues, eventually culminating in a telekinetic blade battle, which Psylocke wins. This allows Marvel Girl's own consciousness to resurface. The three of them fight off the Marauders together and later help Captain Britain and Meggan prevent reality from being destroyed.Uncanny X-Men #462-465 =New Excalibur= Nocturne next appears in New Excalibur, alongside Juggernaut, Sage, Dazzler, Captain Britain, and Pete Wisdom. During her time with New Excalibur, Nocturne developed the ability to possess people without knocking them unconscious. She also suffered a stroke while on the team.New Excalibur #16 She suffered aftereffects, such as hemiparesis, partial memory loss, and aphasia, but was making great strides towards recoveryNew Excalibur #20 Despite this, while only partially recovered, she was able to save numerous civilians in the battle against Albion by possessing one of Albion's evil Captain Britains. She was recently reunited with the Exiles, including her lover Thunderbird who is no longer comatose.X-Men: Die by the Sword #1-5 However her return to the Exiles is short, because after defeating Mad Jim Jaspers, Nocturne and Thunderbird leave to help their relationship grow and to help Nocturne more fully recover from her stroke.Exiles #100 Along with Blink, they go to Heather's reality so Heather can keep track of Nocturne's health as she continues to recover from her stroke. =Return to the Exiles= Nocturne made a brief appearance in the final issue of Exiles vol. 2 seemingly having completely recovered from her stroke. She, along with the current team of Exiles, Morph, and Heather briefly merges with the Crystal Palace as a female version of Kang explains the nature of the universe. Also she takes charge of the current team of Exiles while Blink is off to recruit another group of superheroes.Exiles vol. 2 #6 Powers and abilities Like her father, T.J. has a radically unique physiology. She has blue fur covering her body, three fingers per hand, two toes per foot, and a retractable prehensile tail. Her agility, balance, bodily coordination and flexibility are at superhuman levels. She can move in manners that surpass those of an Olympic level gymnast, and has a bone structure allowing great flexibility. She can remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to her spine. She has an ability to cling to surfaces with her hands and feet in a manner similar to Nightcrawler. Her fur provides near-invisibility when in the shadows, and she has excellent vision in dark conditions. Nocturne's powers include the ability to enter and possess another person's body for up to 12 hours; the experience usually leaves the other person comatose for up to 24 hours. Nocturne can also fire \\"hex bolts,\\" destructive projectiles made up of extradimensional energy from the dimension through which Nightcrawler teleports. Nocturne also has a degree of latent telepathy, but it was only usable to any degree when enhanced by a Cerebro machine. She does not appear to possess any abilities related to her mother's reality alteration abilities, but the \\"hex bolts\\" that she derives from her father are named after her mother's powers in homage. Other versions * Before the start of X-Men: The End trilogy of miniseries, Nocturne is captured by Tullamore Voge and turned into one of his slavers. During X-Men: The End, Aliyah Bishop saves her from Voge, and Nocturne aids the X-Men in the final battle with Cassandra Nova. She is one of the lucky ones to survive the final battle, and lives with Nightcrawler and his family. She is seen among the survivors twenty years later at President Kitty Pryde's speech to the mutants. * In the 1990 Days of Future Present crossover storyline, a future version of Franklin Richards reveals the New Mutants of the future, including a similar appearing daughter of Nightcrawler named Blue.New Mutants Annual #6. Marvel Comics. This character, however, possesses her father's teleportation abilities, albeit at a greatly enhanced scale. Relations Nocturne has strong relationships with many of her fellow X-Men, including her \\"aunt\\" Kitty Pryde and her boyfriend James Proudstar, her reality's Thunderbird. She is also very close to her father, Nightcrawler. Due to her being the daughter of Nightcrawler and the Scarlet Witch she is part of a very large and complex family.

The concert originally aired on MTV on November 11, 1992 with a one-hour Springsteen documentary beforehand. Springsteen played one song, the previously unreleased \\"Red Headed Woman\\", solo on acoustic guitar, then he and his hired band (this was during the time the E Street Band was dissolved, although members Roy Bittan and Patti Scialfa continued to perform with Springsteen) used amplified instruments the rest of the show; hence, the concert was called MTV Plugged (sometimes written XXPlugged after the album cover art). Reportedly Springsteen had been unhappy with the touring band's rehearsals of acoustic arrangements, and this is what led him to break the Unplugged format. Commercially the album was certified Gold in the US. Album The album had a moderate reception. \\"With E Street ringers focusing on Bruce's 'solo' material...,\\" said Entertainment Weekly, \\"Well, we won't go there.\\" The numbers played on the show were relatively intense renditions, as highlighted by Springsteen's vocals and much of the instrumental accompaniment. The sombre, folk-oriented \\"Atlantic City\\" was played in a rock setting, with a rhythm intro on electric guitar as well as Springsteen's solos on the outro.

He is the frontman of his own band, Love Amongst Ruin. Hewitt is best known for his tenure as the drummer for Placebo between September 1996 and October 2007. He plays drums and guitar left- handed. Personal life and influences  Hewitt was born in Northwich, Cheshire, England and attended Weaverham High School. Hewitt has a daughter and had a second child in early 2010. His elder daughter Emily performed backing vocals on Love Song, the final track on Love Amongst Ruin's 2010 debut album. Hewitt was inspired to become a drummer after watching Phil Taylor performing Ace of Spades with Motörhead on Top of the Pops. He \\"hassled\\" his parents to get him a drum kit and when they did, he taught himself to play. Hewitt also acknowledges drummers Phil Rudd (AC/DC) and John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) as influences. Hewitt was musically active at school, drumming and putting on performances. He lists some of his influences as The Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Radiohead and Can. He recalled that his family \\"loved music\\" and driving on caravan holidays in the car would be punctuated by the sounds of Bee Gees, Elton John, ELO and The Beatles. Hewitt worked as a picture framer before leaving school and upon leaving school he began training to be a race car engineer. He progressed to be offered an opportunity to continue his training with Williams and worked on the team's pit crew. He also worked as a sign writer until deciding to pursue music full-time. Drumming career Early years (1988–1996) = Hewitt began his career in the North West of England, playing with his brother Nick in Misadventure, before leaving in 1988 to join The Mystic Deckchairs. Hewitt joined fellow local musician Tim Burgess in Electric Crayons, prior to Burgess joining The Charlatans in 1989. Hewitt also joined Breed at the age of 17 and linked up with the band for a German tour after spying an advert placed by the band in Affleck's Palace. Following the completion of the tour, Hewitt joined The Boo Radleys on a temporary basis and played on the band's 1990 debut album, Ichabod and I. Hewitt rejoined Breed in 1991 and played on the albums Grin in 1991 and Violet Sentimental in 1993. Despite a support slot on Nick Cave's Let Love In tour, Breed found commercial success elusive and following a disastrous gig at the Bull & Gate in London in 1996, the band split. While in Breed, Hewitt also played for house act K-Klass. The need for money during these years saw Hewitt take on session work in London, recording jingles and appearing on releases by Baby June and Sharkboy. On 6 December 2004, Breed reformed for a one-off gig at Lock 17 in Camden Lock Market, London. = Placebo (1996–2007) = Hewitt met Brian Molko in 1991 through his then-girlfriend and was invited to drum on demos for Molko's band Placebo, though Hewitt was unable to join the band due to his commitments to Breed. The band earned a record deal with drummer Robert Schultzberg, who played on the trio's 1996 debut album. In the autumn of 1996, tensions between Schultzberg, Molko and bassist Stefan Olsdal led to Schultzberg's departure from the band. Breed's breakup around the same time allowed Hewitt to accept the invitation to join Placebo permanently. Hewitt appeared in the video for the band's 1997 \\"Nancy Boy\\" single with his face blurred out, because he was still under contract to a different record label. After completing touring for Placebo, the band wrote and recorded their second album, Without You I'm Nothing, released in October 1998. The first official Placebo release to feature Hewitt was the \\"Pure Morning\\" single, released in August 1998. Hewitt drummed and contributed to the songwriting on subsequent albums Black Market Music (2000), Sleeping with Ghosts (2003) and Meds (2006) with the band. On 1 October 2007, after the completion of the tour supporting Meds, it was announced via the official Placebo website that Hewitt had parted company with Placebo due to \\"personal and musical differences\\". He was replaced in 2008 by Steve Forrest, the band's first right-handed drummer. = Love Amongst Ruin (2007–present) = Feeling \\"betrayed\\" after leaving Placebo and faced with a decision \\"to go to the pub or the studio\\", Hewitt returned to his home studio and began creating \\"a new band, a new album and a new sound\\". He contributed drums, guitars, piano and lead vocals to the album and enlisted Jon Thorne and Donald Ross Skinner as collaborators. Steve's brother Nick Hewitt recorded additional guitars and Hewitt felt that he had captured his best ever drum sound on the album. The band was named Love Amongst Ruin in late 2009 and Hewitt assuming frontman duties. The band's debut gig at the Eurosonic Festival in the Netherlands on 14 January 2010 was his first public appearance since leaving Placebo. Love Amongst Ruin's self-titled debut album was released on 13 September 2010 and was supported by UK and European tours through 2010 and 2011. Hewitt wrote and recorded the band's second album Lose Your Way with Donald Ross Skinner in 2011 and 2012, but the album was withheld from release until 27 June 2015. The album was supported by a short European tour. = Six by Seven (2012–2013) = Hewitt befriended members of the band Six by Seven when they toured as opening act for Placebo in 1998. In 2012, Hewitt and Six by Seven frontman Chris Olley were reintroduced by mutual friend Steve Hove (a then-guitarist for Love Amongst Ruin) and began rehearsing new material for Olley's project (The Death of) Six By Seven. The material they wrote eventually saw the project morph into a reformed Six by Seven. Hewitt was announced as the band's new drummer in August 2012. The band entered Moles Studio in Bath in January 2013 to record the band's seventh album. The album, titled Love and Peace and Sympathy, was released on 16 April 2013 and the band embarked on a UK tour in mid-2013, which included a slot at Glastonbury Festival. Hewitt's year was ended by a broken arm suffered in October 2013, which caused him to miss an in-store signing at Fopp in Nottingham and a performance at Soundedit Festival. Chris Olley reported on his blog in May 2014 that he had recorded a new Six by Seven album by himself, which hinted that Hewitt had left the band.  Collaborations and production career  Lys = Hewitt struck up a friendship with French band Lys while touring to support Love Amongst Ruin in 2011. As executive producer, Hewitt and Paul Corkett oversaw the production of six songs on Lys' 2013 debut album Go Your Own Way. He worked on Lys' 2015 sophomore album Rebud in 2015 and has been regular guest at the band's live shows. = Other projects = In 2010, Hewitt joined songwriter/producer Brandun Reed as a collaborator on Reed's Polaroid Kiss project and played on the albums The New Coliseum (2013) and Youth (2015). In 2013, he produced the entirety of Italian band Spiral 69's third album Ghosts in My Eyes. As of May 2015, Hewitt was recording and producing pop singer DéDé and recording drums for Paul Draper's solo album.

Chesnutt, set at the time and portraying a fictional account of the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in Wilmington, North Carolina. Plot introduction This story is a fictional account of the rise of the white supremacist movement, specifically as it contributed to the \\"race riots\\" that took place in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1898. Critics argue over what would be a more proper term; some favor \\"massacre\\" while a North Carolina state commission ruled that it was a coup d'etat, the only overthrow of a legitimately elected government in United States history. Whites attacked and killed blacks in the city and overthrew the county government, establishing white supremacists in power.Mike Baker (AP), \\"1898 Race Clash Ruled a Coup\\", Washington Post, May 31, 2006, accessed August 23, 2012 Chesnutt anticipated the book would \\"become lodged in the popular mind as the legitimate successor of Uncle Tom's Cabin... as depicting an era in our national history\\".Wilson, Matthew. Whiteness in the Novels of Charles W. Chesnutt. University Press of Mississippi, 2004: 100. The book was poorly received in the South and received mixed reviews in the North. It ultimately sold only 3,726 copies in its first year.Wilson, Matthew. Whiteness in the Novels of Charles W. Chesnutt. University Press of Mississippi, 2004: 101. Plot summary Set in the fictional town of Wellington, The Marrow of Tradition features several interweaving plots that encompass the poles of the racially segregated society of the American South at the turn of the century. One plot follows Major Carteret, the white owner of the major Wellington newspaper, as he colludes with several other powerful white men to take political control of the town. They are outraged about a provocative editorial published in a black paper that questioned white justifications for lynchings. As the town’s unrest intensifies, Carteret faces domestic pressures; his only child Dodie and wife Olivia are both unwell. Carteret’s niece Clara, recently introduced to society, is courted by the young Tom Delamere, a handsome and conniving aristocrat who spends most evenings nurturing his penchant for drink and cards. His habits are contrasted with those of Lee Ellis, a rival for Clara, and William Miller, a young black physician who with his wife has returned to his hometown of Wellington to practice medicine. He gained his medical education in Paris and Vienna. Though jarred by segregation and Jim Crow racism, Miller sets up his practice and starts his life. Miller's wife, Janet, is the biracial half-sister of Mrs. Olivia Carteret; Janet spends her entire life hoping to be acknowledged by her white sister, who is too proud to accept her father's miscegenation after her mother died. Josh Green as a boy witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of a white man—a character named Captain McBane—and is intent on exacting revenge. All these subplots are forced to a crisis through two events: the murder of a white woman, Polly Ochiltree, for which a black servant, Sandy Campbell, is accused, and county elections. Campbell would have been lynched and burned without a trial if it weren't for Miller alerting his boss, the grandfather of the actual murderer, Tom Delamere. Old Mr. Delamere and Lee Ellis discover the truth and save Sandy's life, but Tom is never apprehended for his crime. A few months later, on the eve of the elections Major Carteret, Captain McBain, and one General Belmont conspired to incite a \\"revolution,\\" overthrowing the Republican party from power and keeping blacks from participating in the elections. They published inflammatory statements in the Morning Chronicle and the revolution quickly became a riot which engulfed the town. The novel culminates with justice for some—the faithful servant Campbell is saved by his patron, Delamere falls from grace, Josh Green avenges his father's death albeit at the cost of his own life, and Janet Miller gains recognition from her sister, who, along with Major Carteret, was humbled to respect the black Miller family in order to save an ailing Dodie. Major themes The novel was written in direct refutation of many of sensationalized accounts of the \\"race riot\\" in Wilmington. These accounts included inaccurate news reports and a series of white supremacist novels. These accounts were the only ones available to readers in the North, whose knowledge was limited to what was readily available in print. Chesnutt himself reflected on the book in 1905, answering a letter on behalf of a high school student: \\"The book was received by the public with respect, but not with any great enthusiasm. By the public I mean the great reading public whose opinion is reflected by the newspapers and magazines which reflect public opinion. It had a fair sale, but was criticized as being bitter. I did not intend it to be so. Nor do I think it was.\\"McElrath, Joesph R., Jr. \\"W. D. Howells and Race: Charles W. Chesnutt's Disappointment of the Dean\\". Nineteenth-Century Literature. Vol. 51, No. 4 (Mar., 1997): 498. Allusions/references to history The novel portrays the many classes and races in the postbellum southern United States, and depicts the Wilmington insurrection of 1898.

The character is known as one of the first recurring villains of the Teen Titans. Publication history Mad Mod first appeared in Teen Titans #7 and was created by Bob Haney and Nick Cardy. Fictional character biography One of the first villains to menace the Teen Titans, Mad Mod (real name Neil Richards) was a Carnaby Street fashion designer with no actual superpowers of his own. His assumed name is derived from the popular Mod style in England at the time. He used his label as a front to smuggle goods inside his clothing. After being foiled, he later hatched a plot to steal the Queen of Britain's scepter, but was stopped as well by the Titans. The character disappeared following the cancellation of the original Teen Titans and was absent from the 1980-1994 series written by Marv Wolfman. The character resurfaced in the Dan Jurgans written Teen Titans series of the mid-1990s, as an ally of the Mr. Jupiter backed version of the Titans. The character was shown having renounced crime and designed the Jurgans Titans team's costumes. The character's clothing lines would later be referenced on occasion in various Teen Titans books, with the implication that Mod is a popular clothing designer on par with other real world fashion designers in the DC Universe. =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Mad Mod was a member of a group known as \\"Diablo\\", that seeks to prevent the original Teen Titans from regaining their memories of their original incarnation of the group. Mad Mod is portrayed as a hipster figure as opposed to a \\"mod\\" complete with a handlebar mustache, much younger than his pre-New 52 incarnation. Mad Mod interrogates the super-heroine Bumblebee after her husband is kidnapped by Mister Twister who Diablo seeks to stop. When Mad Mod realizes that the Titans have regained their memories of their past activities, Mad Mod orders the team killed in order to stop Mister Twister from using them in an occult ritual.Titans Hunt #6 Powers and abilities During the Mad Mod's heyday as a villain, he would match his outrageous clothing with a way out approach in his intricate but deadly traps. He would employ a gang of thugs to do most of the handiwork that needed muscle. Mad Mod term The term \\"Mad Mod, Poet God\\" was used by Peter Milligan for the unrelated DC character Shade, the Changing Man. Another unrelated DC character is the Mad Mod Witch from The Unexpected, later revealed to be a resident of the Dreaming known as \\"the Fashion Thing\\".  Alternate versions  In the Titans Tomorrow future the Titans battled Mad Mod's synthetics. They later mentioned they killed Mad Mod. In other mediaTelevision= Teen Titans. * Mad Mod appeared in the Teen Titans TV series voiced by Malcolm McDowell. Mad Mod has no superpowers of his own, but he is a master of technological trickery such as robots and holographic projectors, which he controls with a ruby-handled cane. His ability to produce illusions resulted in surreal, 1960s-styled landscapes, and allowed \\"Moddie\\" to appear in several different forms; even appearing stylized in the manner of God as he appeared in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, or becoming a round Blue Meanie-esque figure. In one circumstance, he was able to use such a cane to drain the youth from someone, making them old and him young again. He has an English accent and is utterly anglophilic. Moddie, as he often calls himself, tends to view the Titans as rebellious \\"snots\\", and claims that they show no respect for their elders. He has an odd habit of calling people \\"my duckies\\". He first appears in \\"Mad Mod\\", where he kidnaps the Titans, frequently calls them, \\"My Duckies\\", and places them in a psychedelic \\"school\\". He attempts to \\"teach them to behave\\" through hypnosis, using methods similar to the Ludovico technique (used in A Clockwork Orange, which McDowell starred in). When his initial attempts fail, he leads them on a Scooby-Doo-like chase through a Yellow Submarine-esque maze. The Titans escape when Robin realizes that Mad Mod is as fake as the rest of their surroundings; he thus abandons his attempts to capture him in favor of searching for flaws in the illusion. He quickly notices one — Mod's weapons have made an intriguing hole in the backdrop, which leads into the illusion's internal works. This enables him to make his way to the control room where he confronts the real Mad Mod — a sickly-looking old man using an advanced computer to control the whole school and a hologram of his younger self. Robin, of course, has no trouble defeating him. In \\"Revolution\\", Mad Mod crashes the Independence Day celebration claiming the American Revolution was a hoax. He then remakes the entire city in the image of Old England by using hypno- screens to control the population and giant illusions to change the look of the entire city to that of Merry Old London, claiming that \\"the United States belongs to England again\\". Mad Mod also kidnaps Robin and uses his cane to drain his youth, reducing Robin to a weak and helpless old man, while Mad Mod becomes his younger self again. The other Titans are initially prevented from reaching Mad Mod and freeing Robin by various large robots modeled after the Coldstream Guards and Mad Mod anticipating their plans. Later, they succeed in getting the cane from him. Robin then uses it to reverse the aging effects. He breaks the cane, thus ending Mad Mod's rule over the city by deactivating his equipment. The Titans then chase after Mad Mod. Mad Mod's aged form made a cameo appearance in \\"The Lost Episode\\" as one of the audience members in the orchestra and is last seen fleeing when Punk Rocket strikes. He later has several small appearances as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil where he is somehow young again. In \\"Revved Up\\", Mad Mod was seen taking part in Ding Dong Daddy's race. He was last seen fighting in \\"Titans Together\\", where he was blown off his feet by Beast Boy's Tyrannosaurus form. He was briefly possessed by Jericho and then was crushed by Overload. Jericho then left his body. He was flash-frozen along with the rest of the Brotherhood in the end. * A super deformed version of Mad Mod appears in the DC Nation Shorts cartoon short series \\"New Teen Titans\\". The episode featuring Mad Mod had him using a machine to manipulate time in order to make himself young again by turning time back to the 1960s. His machine is shown as resembling a British phone box, with a similar design for the TARDIS from Doctor Who. In the short, the Titans are shown as they have been drawn throughout the decades with Mad Mod finally being defeated and Robin winding up in the future as a robot. * Mad Mod appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Salty Codgers\\". He was going around Jump City turning everyone into old people. He even manages to turn the Teen Titans (except for Raven) into old people as well, much to Raven's initial delight as she adores old people. =Film= Mad Mod makes a silent cameo appearance in the Teen Titans Go! theatrical film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. In the film, as many villains including Control Freak, Mad Mod appears strapped to a light signal which forms Robin's name in the sky during Robin's musical number \\"My Superhero Movie\\". =Miscellaneous= * In Teen Titans Go! (the comic based on the cartoon), Mad Mod attempts to rule the world by selling people clothes that control their minds, and soon the civilians, along with Beast Boy and Starfire, are under Mad Mod's control and attack the remaining Titans. Cyborg uses a sonic device to destroy Mad Mod's clothes, which leaves everyone that wore the clothes naked, much to their shock and embarrassment — especially Robin upon the sight of Starfire. The Teen Titans then stop Mad Mod. * Mad Mod appeared in issue #7 of the comic book tie-in to Batman: The Brave and the Bold. This iteration is similar to his portrayal in the Teen Titans animated series. He captures almost all of Doom Patrol and plans to duplicate their costumes to sell to other villains and was defeated by the team and Batman. He appears again in the 15th issue but was stopped by Batman, Super-Hip and Brother Power the Geek. He appears at the beginning of Volume 2, #16 (the final issue), and is defeated by Batman and Batgirl. *Neil Richards exists as an artist based in Gotham City in the DC Extended Universe, as mentioned in the guide book Time Out Shortlist Gotham City and Metropolis, which was released as a tie-in to the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. =Video games= * Mad Mod is an unlockable character in the \\"Master of Games\\" mode in the console Teen Titans video game. In the game, he is voiced by Greg Ellis, and is the only character featured in the game with a different voice actor than that of the TV series. He isn't included in the story mode like Control Freak, Blackfire, and others that appear in Master of Games mode. *Mad Mod is among many other DC characters included in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure.

It is named for the Kickapoo Indians who occupied Wisconsin before the influx of white settlers in the early 19th century. Watershed The river begins midway between Wilton, Wisconsin and Mill Bluff State Park and flows south through a deep valley cut into the hilly Driftless Zone of southwest Wisconsin. It empties into the Wisconsin River just south of Wauzeka, Wisconsin. Kickapoo is an Algonquian word meaning \\"one who goes here, then there\\", a fitting name as the river is very crooked, frequently doubling back on itself as it flows through the Wisconsin landscape. Because of the extremely crooked path of the river, its source north of Wilton is just from its mouth at Wauzeka, although the river is nearly long. The Kickapoo, the longest tributary of the Wisconsin River, drains over of land in Monroe, Vernon, Richland, and Crawford counties. The Kickapoo River watershed encompasses in southwest Wisconsin. There are many small tributaries with the most significant being Moore Creek, Billings Creek, the West Fork of the Kickapoo, Reads Creek and Tainter Creek. Wetlands have largely been drained for pasture and comprise a tiny portion of the lands in the Kickapoo River watershed, 0.8%, whereas agriculture accounts for 50.4% of the land use followed closely by forest land at 48%. Ecology and conservation Palm warblers breed in the Kickapoo Valley Wildcat Mountain State Park and the Kickapoo Valley Reserve form a continuous protected area. Most of the tributary streams and the Kickapoo River itself, upstream of Gays Mills, are good trout habitat due to the baseflow from coldwater springs and watershed and stream projects carried out over the recent decades. The river \\"contains over of coldwater streams with populations of Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Half of these streams have naturally reproducing trout populations.Wildlife Service PDF file, Retrieved July 22, 2007 left Recently a movement called \\"Save Taryn's Beaver\\" was launched to save a family of beavers on Weister Creek, a tributary of the Kickapoo. The beaver is a keystone species, increasing biodiversity in its territory through creation of beaver ponds and wetlands. Not only are riparian habitats enlarged as the circumference of a beaver pond is much greater than the circumference of the two banks of a stream, but aquatic plants colonize newly available watery habitat. Insect, invertebrate, fish, mammal, and bird diversity are also expanded. Beavers benefit bird diversity in numerous ways. Trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) often depend on beaver lodges as nesting sites. As trees are drowned by rising beaver impoundments they become ideal nesting sites for obligate cavity nesters such as wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), and owls (Titonidae, Strigidae). In addition, beaver ponds have been shown to increase the number of trout, their size, or both, in a study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). These findings are consistent with a study of small streams in Sweden, that found that brown trout were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important (and underappreciated) in streams without deep pools or where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams. Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) were noted to overwinter in Montana beaver ponds, brook trout congregated in winter in New Brunswick and Wyoming beaver ponds, and coho salmon in Oregon beaver ponds. In spite of the benefits of beaver to trout and bird abundance and diversity, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources continues to recommend removal of trees and brush from the banks of several Kickapoo river watershed streams to reduce beaver colonization. Demise of La Farge Dam The uncompleted dam with spillway and intake tower near La Farge, WisconsinThe river has a relatively low capacity for water, leading it to quickly and frequently flood after heavy rain. In the late 1960s, the frequent floods prompted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin a dam project on the Kickapoo River near La Farge, Wisconsin. The proposed dam would have created a 1,780 acre (7.2 km²), 12-mile (19 km) long reservoir to control downstream flooding. In preparation for the construction, the government used eminent domain to buy 149 farms comprising 8,569 acres (35 km²) of land from mostly unwilling sellers. This land would have either been flooded by the dam or used as for the recreational park planned for the area around the lake. Construction of the dam began in 1971. Questions about the Corps of Engineers' benefit-cost calculations, its environmental analysis and the prospect of ecological problems like the eutrophication of the dam's impoundment led to opposition from environmental organizations, some residents of the Kickapoo Valley and Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson. After many lawsuits and numerous environmental and economic studies by outside activists highlighting the negative impact of the dam, the government elected to halt construction in 1975, after spending more than $19 million and building nearly half of the dam and leaving local residents vulnerable to future flooding. The halting of the project also doomed the 1983 attempt by local residents to get government support for a smaller flood control dry dam. Lawsuits by local residents in the valley to force completion of the project were rejected. , Two Visions of the Kickapoo River: Voices For and Against the Lake LaFarge Dam Project, Cronon and Janowski 2003, Retrieved December 16, 2013 The 8,569 acres (35 km²) of land bought by the government remained in the possession of the Corps of Engineers until 1996, when it was split and parts were given to the state of Wisconsin and the Ho-Chunk Native American Tribe.Army Corps of Engineers , Retrieved July 22, 2007 The Kickapoo today is a popular canoeing river. Flooding Kickapoo River in Gays Mills in 2010 Nationwide, the construction of flood control structures has saved lives and property, but in some cases structures have been found to result in greater loss of life and property than if they had not been built. Dams, for example, encourage downstream development; if they fail, as some do, the destruction can be catastrophic. Today, an increasing number and intensity of extreme weather events is sometimes exceeding the design capacity of flood control structures. Because of the abandonment of the La Farge flood control project the Kickpoo Valley continues to suffer from catastrophic flooding. Major floods have occurred in 1978, 2007 and 2008. In the mid-1970s, Soldiers Grove residents decided on an alternative to the Corps of Engineers' plan to build a levee around the village and undertook the relocation of the community's central business district to higher ground. The relocation was completed several years later, with the business district rebuilt out of reach flooding and heated largely with passive solar systems. The project became a national model of nonstructural flood control. Soldiers Grove was virtually undamaged by the 2007 flooding that cost well over $60 million in the Kickapoo Valley, and after the 2008 floods, communities are being forced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to move from their historic locations requiring even more unwilling residents to have to relocate. The Kickapoo River flooded over its banks in Gays Mills in 2007 and again from the June 2008 Midwest floods.

Crocodile Garments was founded by the late Dr. Chan Shun (1917-1997) in 1952.  History  When he was young, Chan learnt to sew and fix sewing machines, which he used to earn money while traveling between Chinese towns in his teenage years. Chan founded his company, then called the Li Wah Man Shirt Factory (), in 1952. The brand of Crocodile Garments was introduced after Chan wanted his products to be as \\"tough and luxurious as crocodile skin\\". The company was able to secure the trademark, initially registered in 1910 by Germans before it was confiscated by British authorities after World War II. Chan retired in 1970 and let his children run the company. Crocodile Garments was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1971, and in 1987, the business was sold to Lai Sun Garment, controlled by the late billionaire Lim Por Yen.13元錢起家的一代富豪:林百欣生前身後事 \\"The Lim Por-yen story\\" , www.cctv.com, 17 October 2005 Crocodile Garments originally sold dress shirts before expanding to become the largest chain garment store in Hong Kong. They exported to Japan, Singapore and other Asian Countries. A second line called Cal-Thomas was started in CA, USA. Crocodile emerged as the leading fashion label with the expansion of a woman's line and children's line called CrocoKids. At its peak, Crocodile garments was the largest garment chain before the conception of G2000, Giordano, U2 and Bossini in the 1990s. In 1980, Crocodile Garments partnered with French clothing company Lacoste to become the sole distributor of Lacoste products in Hong Kong. Between 2015 and 2020, the share of Crocodile Garments lost 72% of its value.Some Crocodile Garments (HKG:122) Shareholders Have Taken A Painful 72% Share Price Drop, Simplywall.st, 12 June 2020 In 2019, the heirs to the Crocodile Garments fortune were ordered by the Canadian fiscal authorities to hand out documents related to an offshore company used by the heirs to make massive donations in Canada.Ian Young, Hong Kong’s Chan brothers, famed for charity in Canada, fight tax investigation over KPMG offshore firms, Scmp.com, 27 August 2019  Legal dispute with Lacoste  Despite the Hong Kong distribution deal with Lacoste, Crocodile had a long-standing dispute over the logo and clothing lines with the French company. Crocodile uses a crocodile logo that faces left, while Lacoste uses one that faces right. Lacoste had registered their trademark in mainland China in 1980, the same year both companies agreed to let Crocodile have exclusive rights to sell Lacoste goods in Hong Kong. When Crocodile attempted to apply for a trademark in mainland China however, Lacoste filed lawsuits in 1998 in both Hong Kong and Beijing, asking for a 3.5-million-yuan compensation. Lacoste alleged that as part of their distribution agreement, Crocodile promised to not use any logo similar to Lacoste's outside of Hong Kong. Lacoste won their Hong Kong lawsuit in 1999. The two fought an extended fight for the logo rights in China, but eventually reached a compromise in 2003.

The action directors were Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, and the action scenes were performed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. In early North American releases, the film was known as Dead Heat. Thunderbolt is set around the world of auto racing. The film is multilingual; characters speak Cantonese, English and Japanese interchangeably. Plot Chan Foh To is a junkyard mechanic and a part-time race car driver who helps the Hong Kong Police Force in their crackdown on illegal street racing in the country. One night, while helping news reporter Amy Yip and Mr. Lam after their Mitsubishi FTO runs out of gasoline, Chan commandeers the car with Amy inside to chase after a speeding black Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 driven by the dangerous criminal driver Warner \\"Cougar\\" Kaugman. In the high speed car chase's climax, Chan traps Cougar in a police roadblock and has him apprehended. However, due to a lack of evidence and a warrant for arrest, Cougar is immediately released from police custody. Chan continues to be harassed by Amy, who wants to do a cover story of him. After Chan fends off against Cougar's thugs at his junkyard, Cougar is once again arrested when Chan provides a false testimony under the guidance of Interpol agent Steve Cannon. However, Cougar's thugs raid the police station and spring him out of jail. The thugs kill all but Cannon, who kills Cougar's girlfriend before they get away. Cougar then destroys the junkyard and injures Chan's father Chun Tung before taking his younger sisters Dai Mui and Sai Mui hostage to force Chan to race him in Japan. Chan and his racing team build him a yellow Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III race car and prepare for his upcoming race, receiving permission from the police to drive it on the expressway. They arrive in Japan, where Chan storms into and destroys a pachinko hall owned by a yakuza gang before Cougar allows Dai Mui to reunite with her brother. Chan makes the starting grid at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway, but his car is destroyed in a collision. Feeling sympathy for Chan, Miss Kenya, the daughter of a Mitsubishi Motors executive, supplies him with two brand-new white Mitsubishi GTO race cars and a supply of Advan tires for the race. Chan starts at the back of the field, but muscles his way toward the front, despite a 30-second pit penalty and other distractions caused by Amy. He approaches and battles Cougar for the lead. During the final lap, both cars slide off the track into the gravel pit, facing each other as they struggle to get back on the road. Cougar gets out first, but Chan floors it in reverse before both cars cross the line in a photo finish. Chan wins the race during the spin back forward when his front end touches the finish line first. Cougar attempts to flee from the police, but Chan chases him around the circuit before sending him crashing violently off the track. Chan pulls Cougar out of the burning wreckage for the police to arrest him, and Cannon reveals that he and his team rescued Sai Mui. He then reconciles with Amy and kisses her.

This box set mostly consists of never-before-released songs recorded during the sessions for his many albums, but also includes a number of single B-sides, as well as demos and alternate versions of already- released material. History The project began in February 1998, when Springsteen and his chief recording engineer, Toby Scott, began going through his massive collection of unreleased songs. Springsteen had been known as a very prolific songwriter (Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, and Born in the U.S.A. each had more than 50 songs written for them), and by 1998 the number of unreleased songs was up to more than 350— 3/4 of all his recorded material. Scott had begun on a computerized database of Springsteen's archives in 1985 in order to allow Springsteen to find specific songs that hadn't been released yet, and it was understood by Scott and others since the 1980s that Springsteen would eventually compile a selection of these unreleased recordings into a box set. Springsteen, engineer Chuck Plotkin and manager Jon Landau had considered releasing these songs in their current rough-mix form, going as far as mastering them in a test-run to get an idea of what they would sound like, but following a listening session in June, it was decided to mix them properly from the original multi-track tapes. Around this time, Sony Music was alerted that the project was in-progress, and they created their own timetable for promotion and release with a September 10 deadline for the final submission of the master tapes. According to Scott, they hadn't even completed a final list of songs by June, and the three-month schedule placed a lot of pressure on them to locate, remix and master the final track list in time to meet Sony's deadline. Springsteen, Scott, and three sets of engineers spent the next three months going through Springsteen's massive song library, locating the multi-track reels with Scott's database, mixing songs and picking out the best of the unreleased material. Sometimes, a song would need extra parts added on, such as in the case of \\"Thundercrack\\", a song dating back to 1973. Springsteen called in then-former bandmates Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons, along with original drummer Vini Lopez to fill in the missing pieces. Though Springsteen already had a personal recording studio on his Jersey estate, the set-up was awkward, using modest equipment in unconventional ways just to meet contemporary standards of professional recording. By the end of June, Scott was upgrading the facility into a far more sophisticated operation in order to meet the September deadline. Additionally, they began scheduling mix sessions across three different studios as the engineers' availability would be limited due to work with other clients. Springsteen's longtime engineer Bob Clearmountain would work remotely from Los Angeles, where he was already booked on other projects through August. Ed Thacker would mix at Springsteen's newly upgraded facility from July through September. Thom Panunzio would also mix at Springsteen's estate from the end of July through all of August, but he would work out of a mobile studio rented from the Record Plant as Thacker would be working out of Springsteen's studio at the same time. The material would also be divided up chronologically among the three engineers. For example, Panunzio would remix the earliest material as he had worked on many of those recordings when they were first made. Clearmountain mixed all of the material from the 1990s and Thacker mixed all of the material in-between as well as some of the earlier recordings. Up until early August, Scott would be coordinating the entire project by phone from his home in Whitefish, Montana as he was expecting the birth of his first child, and engineer Greg Goldman would join the project as Scott's eyes and ears on the ground in Jersey where much of the team was located. On a typical day in August, when all three engineers were working simultaneously, Panunzio and Thacker would generally set up a mix during the evening, returning the next morning to finish. Springsteen would call in during the afternoon and show up between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to listen to mixes and make any suggested changes. Plotkin would be present, adding his input, and he would also have his mixes played back in real time on a receiving unit set up in Springsteen's living room at the compound. One of the most common changes between the new mixes and the vintage rough mixes was the difference in reverb. According to Thacker, Springsteen's vocals were originally \\"very big and sitting in the track surrounded by reverb,\\" but Springsteen was now requesting him to \\"make the vocals drier than they might have been 20 years ago [and to] make them a little more personal.\\" By the end of June, they had a preliminary list of 128 songs selected for the box set, and the following July, they cut it down to 100 songs (six CDs worth). However, Springsteen eventually decided to cut the number to 66, leaving a total of four CDs. By then, Scott’s wife had delivered and he was back on-site in Jersey. As the final mixes were approved, Scott loaded them on to a digital workstation and assembled them in sequence as they would appear in the final boxed set. This meant setting spacings, doing crossfades and other editing tasks that are often saved for the mastering stage if more time had permitted. These final sequences were outputted on to a hard drive and sent to Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine where they were mastered in a week. After three days of listening tests, Scott, Plotkin and Springsteen signed off on the project and submitted the finished masters on schedule. Even though the original intention was to cover material from all aspects of Springsteen's career, acoustic demos from 1972 (such as \\"Arabian Nights\\", \\"Jazz Musician\\", \\"Ballad of the Self-Loading Pistol\\", and \\"Visitation at Fort Horn\\") were not available for release, due to ongoing court proceedings surrounding the songs (concerning the attempted release of these songs by a different, European based label in 1993). Songs from the \\"Electric Nebraska\\" sessions, as well as songs from an unreleased 1994 album, were also missing. The songs came from varying backgrounds: *\\"Roulette\\", \\"Be True\\", \\"Pink Cadillac\\", \\"Johnny Bye Bye\\", \\"Shut Out the Light\\", \\"Stand on It\\", \\"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\\", \\"Lucky Man\\", \\"Two for the Road\\", and \\"Part Man, Part Monkey\\" were all B-sides to singles. However, the take of \\"Stand on It\\" included on Tracks is a previously unknown alternate version that features an extra verse and a fully finished ending (as opposed to the fade-out on the original B-side). *\\"Bishop Danced\\", \\"Santa Ana\\", \\"Seaside Bar Song\\", \\"Zero and Blind Terry\\", \\"Thundercrack\\", \\"Rendezvous\\", \\"So Young and in Love\\", \\"Man at the Top\\", \\"The Wish\\", \\"When the Lights Go Out\\", and \\"Brothers Under the Bridge\\" were all known from previous live performances. *\\"Hearts of Stone\\" was previously recorded by Southside Johnny. *A rerecorded \\"This Hard Land\\" was released on Greatest Hits, although the original recording did not appear until Tracks. *\\"Linda Let Me Be the One\\", \\"Iceman\\", \\"Bring On the Night\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"Restless Nights\\", \\"Where the Bands Are\\", \\"Loose Ends\\", \\"Living on the Edge of the World\\", \\"Take 'Em as They Come\\", \\"Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own\\", \\"I Wanna Be with You\\", \\"Mary Lou\\", \\"Cynthia\\", \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\", \\"Frankie\\", \\"T.V. Movie\\", and \\"Back in Your Arms\\" had previously been unofficially released on bootlegs, sometimes under different titles. *\\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)\\" and \\"Lion's Den\\" were documented to exist, but had not been officially released. *\\"Give the Girl a Kiss\\", \\"Dollhouse\\", \\"Wages of Sin\\", \\"Car Wash\\", \\"Rockaway the Days\\", \\"Brothers Under the Bridges ('83)\\", \\"When You Need Me\\", \\"The Honeymooners\\", \\"Leavin' Train\\", \\"Seven Angels\\", \\"Gave It a Name\\", \\"Sad Eyes\\", \\"My Lover Man\\", \\"Over the Rise\\", \\"Loose Change\\", \\"Trouble in Paradise\\", \\"Goin' Cali\\", and \\"Happy\\" were all unknown songs before Tracks. The box set was a minor success, peaking at #27 on the Billboard 200 album chart. It has been certified platinum in the U.S. and gold in Canada. Since its release, 44 of the songs on the set have been played live at least once, with \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" receiving the most attention at over 100 plays. The box set was later condensed into a single-disc album called 18 Tracks, with 3 songs (\\"Trouble River\\", \\"The Fever\\", and \\"The Promise\\") not on the 4-CD box set. As a result of the project, Sony Music also created its own archive database, making extensive use of Scott’s cataloging efforts over the previous decade. The same database would be used in all of Springsteen's subsequent archival projects.

Akeman was well-known for his \\"old-fashioned\\" banjo-picking style, careful mix of comedy and music, and his memorable stage wardrobe (which consisted of a long nightshirt tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees— giving him the comical appearance of a very tall man with stubby legs). Akeman and his wife were murdered by burglars in their rural Tennessee home near Ridgetop In 1973. BiographyEarly life and career= Born in Annville, Jackson County, Kentucky, Akeman came from a musical family, including his father, James Akeman, who played the banjo at local dances.http://davidakeman.com He got his first banjo when he was 12 years old in exchange for a pair of prize bantam chickens. Akeman began playing at local dances and gained a reputation as a musician, but the income was not enough to live on. He joined the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps, building roads and planting trees. Eventually, he entered a talent contest judged by Asa Martin. He won and was invited to join Martin's band. During an early appearance, Martin forgot Akeman's name and introduced him as \\"String Bean\\" because of his tall, thin build. Akeman used the nickname the rest of his career. Akeman originally was only a musician, but when another performer failed to show up one night, he was used as a singer and comic. From then on, Akeman did both comedy and music. He appeared on WLAP-AM in Lexington, Kentucky, and played with several groups in the late 1930s. Akeman also played semiprofessional baseball. As a ballplayer, he met bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe, who fielded with another semipro team. From 1943 to 1945, Akeman played banjo for Monroe's band, performing on recordings such as \\"Goodbye Old Pal\\". He also teamed with Willie Egbert Westbrook as String Beans and Cousin Wilbur, a comedy duo who appeared on the same bill as Monroe's band. When he left Monroe, he was replaced by Earl Scruggs, a banjoist with a very different style. In 1945, Akeman married Estell Stanfill. The same year, he formed a comedy duet with Willie Egbert Westbrook, and they were invited to perform on the Grand Ole Opry. The following year, Akeman began working with Grandpa Jones, another old-time banjo player and comedian. Jones and Akeman worked together at the Opry and many years later on the Hee Haw television series. They also became neighbors in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Akeman became a protégé of Uncle Dave Macon, one of the biggest Opry stars. Near the end of his life, Macon gave Akeman one of his prized banjos. =Later life and career= Akeman, by now known only as Stringbean, was one of the Opry's major stars in the 1950s. He adopted a stage costume that accentuated his height—a shirt with an exceptionally long waist and tail, tucked into a pair of short blue jeans (from Little Jimmy Dickens) belted around his knees. The costume had many antecedents, including Slim Miller, a onetime stage comedian said to be Akeman's inspiration. Akeman did not record as a solo artist until the early 1960s, when he was signed by the Starday label. Akeman remained a celebrated performer of the old-fashioned banjo playing, \\"clawhammer\\" or \\"frailing\\". In addition to his skill as a clawhammer player, Akeman also frequently played two-finger banjo, using thumb and forefinger. Akeman is listed with Uncle Dave Macon, Grandpa Jones, and Ralph Stanley as the greatest old-time style banjo pickers. Akeman kept his audience with his traditional playing and his mixture of comedy and song. He scored country-chart hits with \\"Chewing Gum\\" and \\"I Wonder Where Wanda Went\\". Between 1962 and 1971, he recorded seven albums. The first, Old Time Pickin' & Grinnin' with Stringbean (1961), included folk songs (especially humorous animal songs), tall stories, and country jokes. In 1969, Akeman and Grandpa Jones became cast members of a new television show entitled Hee Haw. One of his regular routines was reading a \\"letter from home\\" to his friends. Asked about the latest letter, Stringbean would take it out, saying he carried it \\"right next to my heart\\". Not finding it in his overalls pocket, he would check all of his other pockets by patting them with his hands until he found the letter, usually in his hip pocket. He was also the scarecrow in a cornfield who would say one-liners before being shouted down by the crow on his shoulder. Hee Haw continued airing his taped segments following his death and his final episode was season five, episode 26, which aired on March 23, 1974. =Murder= Akeman was modest and unassuming, and he enjoyed hunting and fishing. Accustomed to the hard times of the Great Depression, Akeman and his wife Estell lived frugally in a small cabin at 2308 Baker Road, near Ridgetop, Tennessee. Their only indulgences were a Cadillac and a color TV. Depression-era bank failures caused Akeman not to trust banks with his money. Gossip around Nashville was that Akeman kept large amounts of cash on hand, though he was by no means wealthy by entertainment industry standards. On Saturday night, November 10, 1973, Akeman and his wife returned home after he performed at the Grand Ole Opry. Both were shot dead shortly after their arrival. The killers had waited for hours. Their corpses were discovered the following morning by their neighbor, Grandpa Jones. A police investigation resulted in the convictions of cousins John A. Brown and Marvin Douglas Brown, both 23 years old. They had ransacked the cabin, and killed Stringbean when he arrived. His wife shrieked when she saw her husband murdered. She begged for her life, but was shot, as well. According to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, \\"Upon their return, Mr. Akeman spotted the intruders in his home and evidently offered some resistance. One of the Brown cousins fatally shot Mr. Akeman, then pursued, shot, and killed Mrs. Akeman. At their trial (where Akeman's fellow cast member and friend Grandpa Jones testified, as he recognized one of the stolen firearms in the defendants' possession as a gift he had given Akeman), each defendant blamed the other for the homicides.\\"Brown v. State, unpublished decision at 1991 WL 242928. The killers took only a chainsaw and some firearms. Marvin Douglas Brown fought his convictions in the appellate courts. On September 28, 1982, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial judge's order denying him a new trial.State v. Brown, 644 S.W.2d 418 (Tenn.Crim.App. 1992). On November 21, 1991, the same court denied his motion for post conviction relief. (State v. Brown, unpublished decision available at 1991 WL 24298) Marvin Brown ultimately granted an exclusive interview to Larry Brinton of the Nashville Banner. He admitted his part in the burglary and murders, but insisted John Brown fired the fatal shots. As Marvin Brown, by his own admission, had committed burglary (a felony) that resulted in death, Brown was legally guilty of murder, regardless of who fired the shots, under Tennessee's felony murder rule. Marvin Brown died of natural causes in 2003, at the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, in Petros, Tennessee, and is buried in the prison cemetery. John Brown was incarcerated in Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility in Nashville. In July 2008, the Tennessee Parole Board deferred any parole for 36 months. He was again denied parole in July 2011. In 2014, John Brown was granted parole and released after serving 41 years of a 198-year sentence. The A&E; cable television network profiled the case on a 1999 episode of its City Confidential series. David and Estell Akeman are buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. During the remaining production of Hee Haw, the scarecrow was left as a memorial. Bluegrass artist Sam Bush recorded \\"The Ballad of Stringbean and Estell”, which tells the story of their murders, for his 2009 album, Circles Around Me. The song was written by Bush, Guy Clark, and Verlon Thompson, and was nominated by the IBMA for Song of the Year in 2011. ReferencesFurther reading *Jones, Louis M. \\"Grandpa\\", with Charles Wolfe.

M. Das, Principles of Geotechnical Engineering, Cengage Learning, 2010, p 7 Early life In 1883, he was born the first child of Army Lieutenant-Colonel Anton von Terzaghi, of Italian origin, and Amalia Eberle in Prague, in what is now the Czech Republic. Upon his father's retirement from the army, the family moved to Graz, Austria. At 10, Terzaghi was sent to a military boarding school, where he developed an interest in astronomy and geography. At age fourteen, Terzaghi entered a different military school, in Hranice, the Crown of Bohemia. He was an excellent student, especially in geometry and mathematics, and graduated with honors at 17.R. E. Goodman, Karl Terzaghi, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1999, p 13 In 1900, Terzaghi entered the Technical University in Graz to study mechanical engineering, where he also developed an interest in theoretical mechanics. He was nearly expelled at one point but ended up graduating with honors in 1904.Goodman p 16 Terzaghi then fulfilled his compulsory one-year military service. While fulfilling his military obligations, Terzaghi translated and greatly expanded a popular English geology field manual to German. He returned to the university for one year and combined the study of geology with courses on subjects such as highway and railway engineering. Shortly afterward, he published his first academic paper on the geology of terraces in southern Styria. Early professional years His first job was as a junior design engineer for the firm Adolph von Pittel, Vienna. The firm was becoming more involved in the relatively new field of hydroelectric power generation, and Karl became involved in the geological problems the firm faced. His responsibilities quickly increased, and by 1908, he was managing a construction site, workers, and the design and construction of steel-reinforced structures. He embarked on a project to construct a hydroelectric dam in Croatia. For six months in Russia, he developed some novel graphical methods for the design of industrial tanks, which he submitted as a thesis for his PhD at the university. He emigrated to the United States in 1912. In the United States, on his own, he undertook an engineering tour of major dam construction sites in the West. He used the opportunity to gather reports and firsthand knowledge of the problems of many different projects, and he returned to Austria in December 1913. When World War I broke out, he found himself drafted into the army as an officer directing a 250-man engineering battalion. He eventually led 1,000 men, faced combat in Serbia, and witnessed the fall of Belgrade.Goodman p 57 After a short stint managing an airfield, he became a professor at the Royal Ottoman College of Engineering in Istanbul (now Istanbul Technical University). There, he began a rigorous study of the properties of soils in an engineering context. Both his measurements and his analysis of the force on retaining walls were first published in English in 1919, and they were quickly recognized as an important new contribution to the scientific understanding of the fundamental behavior of soils.Goodman p 67 After the war, he was forced to resign his post at the University but managed to find a new post at Robert College in Istanbul, where he switched his teaching language from French to English. He began studying experimental and quantitative aspects of the permeability of soils to water and produced theories to explain the observations. He invented novel equipment as part of the work. In 1924 he published Erdbaumechanik auf Bodenphysikalischer Grundlage (The Mechanics of Earth Construction Based on Soil Physics) which would have a profound impact on the field.Goodman p 94-95 That resulted in a job offer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which he accepted. Later years One of his first tasks in the United States was to bring his work to the attention of engineers. Then, he proceeded to do by writing a series of articles for the Engineering News Record, which were published in winter 1925, then as a small book in 1926. He found the facilities at MIT abominable and had to deal with obstruction from the administration. Brushing the obstacles aside, he once more set up a new laboratory geared towards making measurements on soils with instruments of his own devising. He entered a new phase of prolific publication and a rapidly growing and lucrative involvement as an engineering consultant on many large- scale projects. In 1927, Aurelia Schober Plath, who would become the mother of the poet Sylvia Plath, worked as a secretary for Terzaghi. She was of Austrian descent and worked for him by translating a handwritten manuscript in German, dealing with new principles of soil mechanics. After work, they would have dinner together when Terzaghi's conversation led her to Greek drama, Russian literature, the works of Hermann Hesse, the poems of Rainer Maria Rilke as well as the writings of great world philosophers. She claims the experience affected her for the rest of her life and that she \\"realized how narrow my world had been and that self-education could be and should be an exciting lifelong adventure. It was the beginning of my dream for the ideal education of the children I hoped some day to have.\\"Plath, A. S., Letter's Home by Sylvia Plath--Correspondence 1950-1963, Harper and Row, 1975, From 1926 to 1932, Arthur Casagrande, another pioneer of soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, worked as Terzaghi's private assistant at MIT. Terzaghi was much in demand as a dinner companion and was a fascinating conversationalist. His striking good looks and evident power was very attractive to women. In 1928, he met the young Harvard doctoral student in geology, Ruth Dogget, and fell deeply in love. That year, Terzaghi was finally fed up with MIT and its president and determined to return to Europe. He accepted a chair at the Vienna Technische Hochshule in the winter of 1929. He married Ruth, who became his editor and collaborator as well. A short consulting trip to the Soviet Union before taking up his post horrified him, and he came to oppose the communist system there, as a regime exemplified by its brutality and chaos.Goodman p 119 Using Austria as his base, he traveled ceaselessly throughout Europe, consulting, lecturing and making new professional contacts and collaborations. His teaching workload was now relatively light so he continued his experimental investigations and became especially interested in the problems of the settling of foundations, and of grouting. He began writing the manuscript for a much updated and expanded version of Erdbaumechanik, now set for two volumes. However, the political turmoil in Austria began to interfere with his work, and in 1935, he decided to take a leave from Vienna from 1935 to 1936. He began his sabbatical with a short trip to consult with Todt and the architects of the proposed grandiose plans for immense buildings at the Nazi's Party Day Rally site in Nuremberg. That led to a conflict over the best way to lay a sound foundation, which led to a discussion with Hitler himself, who took an intense interest in all details of the architecture.Goodman p 150 Terzaghi then returned to America, where he gave a plenary lecture at the International Conference on Soil Mechanics at Harvard University (the event led to the establishment of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering; Terzaghi was its first president). He made a lecture tour of many other universities but discovered that prospects for employment were dim. He returned to Vienna in September 1936, shortly after the birth of his first son Eric. In Vienna, he returned to a nasty professional and political controversy (including an acrimonious dispute with Paul Fillunger), which he overcame only with some difficulty.Reint De Boer The Engineer and the Scandal-a piece of scientific history Springer Verlag (2005) Goodman ch 12 He memorably stated, \\"The Fatherland denoted me as a Nazi, the Nazis as a Bolshevik, and the Bolsheviks as a conservative idealist. Certainly only one of the three could be right, and that one is the Bolsheviks.\\"Goodman p 168 He escaped from Vienna frequently by extended consulting trips to major construction projects in England, Italy, France, Algeria, and Latvia, adding greatly to his engineering experience. In 1938, he emigrated to the United States and took up a post at Harvard University. By the end of the war, he had consulted on the Chicago subway system, Newport News Shipways construction, and raising the Normandie, among others. He became an American citizen in March 1943.Goodman p 207 He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1946. He remained as a part-timer at Harvard University until his retirement in 1953, at the mandatory age of 70. In July 1954, he became the chairman of the Consulting Board for the construction of the Aswan High Dam. He resigned that post in 1959 after coming into conflict with the Soviet engineers in charge of the project but continued to consult on various hydroelectric projects, especially in British Columbia. He died in 1963, and his ashes were interred in South Waterford, Maine, near \\"Bear's Corner\\", the family retreat. Legacy The American Society of Civil Engineers established in 1960 the Karl Terzaghi Award to an \\"author of outstanding contributions to knowledge in the fields of soil mechanics, subsurface and earthwork engineering, and subsurface and earthwork construction.\\"asce.org The Terzaghi and Peck Library, which is managed by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, in Oslo, Norway, holds an extensive collection of his papers. The Mission Dam in British Columbia, Canada, was renamed in his honor as the Terzaghi Dam in 1965. As Professor Goodman describes him, Karl Terzaghi was a remarkable man and an impassioned engineer. As he put it himself, \\"All the modest achievements which I have to my credit can be described by a simple formula… Guided by common sense and casual observations, I recognized weak points in traditional procedures and tried to make them less weak. Sometimes I failed, but usually I succeeded.\\"Karl Terzaghi's Legacy in Geotechnical Engineering, available by Geoengineer.org  See also  * Consolidation (soil) * Effective stress * Engineering geology * Geotechnical engineering * Retaining wall * Rock mass classifications * Soil mechanics * Subsidence * Terzaghi's principle  Books  * Terzaghi, K., Theoretical Soil Mechanics, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1943) . * Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.

By 1996, the Internet was becoming popular, and X's performance over narrow, slow links was problematic. LBX ran as a proxy server (). It cached commonly used information -- connection setup, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps and so on -- and compressed data transmission over the network link. LBX was never widely deployed as it did not offer significant speed improvements. The slow links it was introduced to help were typically insecure, and RFB (VNC) over a secure shell connection -- which includes compression -- proved faster than LBX, and also provided session resumption. Finally, it was shown that greater speed improvements to X could be obtained for all networked environments with replacement of X's antiquated font system as part of the new composited graphics system, along with care and attention to application and widget toolkit design, particularly care to avoid network round trips and hence latency.

It was instituted in 1857 as the Arctic Medal and renamed the Polar Medal in 1904.  History  The first polar award was called the Arctic Medal which was presented twice in the 19th century. The Admiralty issued the medal in 1857 for several expeditions, including the expedition to discover the fate of Sir John Franklin and his crew who were lost while looking for the Northwest Passage in 1847: > Her Majesty having been graciously pleased to signify her commands that a > Medal be granted to all persons, of every rank and class, who have been > engaged in the several Expeditions to the Arctic Regions, whether of > discovery or search, between the years 1818 and 1855, both inclusive. The second presentation of the Arctic Medal was to the crews of three ships exploring the Arctic in 1875–76. In 1904, the Polar Medal was inaugurated for members of Captain Scott's first expedition to Antarctica. It was also awarded to the crews of both rescue ships, Terra Nova and Morning. Subsequent medals were also awarded to members of Ernest Shackleton's expeditions in 1907–09 and 1914–17. Until 1968, the Polar Medal was presented to anyone who participated in a polar expedition endorsed by the governments of any Commonwealth realms. However since then the rules governing its presentation have been revised with greater emphasis placed on personal achievement. The Medal may be conferred on those citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland who have personally made conspicuous contributions to the knowledge of Polar regions or who have rendered prolonged service of outstanding quality in support of acquisition of such knowledge and who, in either case, have undergone the hazards and rigours imposed by the Polar environment. The Medal may also be awarded in recognition of individual service of outstanding quality in support of the objectives of Polar expeditions, due account being taken of the difficulties overcome. A total of 880 silver and 245 bronze medals have been issued for Antarctic expeditions. Another 73 silver medals have been issued for service in the Arctic. In 2016 the medal was awarded to Kim Crosbie for her work in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. Also in 2016, Agnieszka Fryckowska was awarded a Polar Medal at Buckingham Palace. Several people have been awarded clasps to the medal for earning the award again for polar expeditions. Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce hold the joint record of four clasps on their Polar Medal. Ranulph Fiennes is the only person to have received a clasp each for both the Arctic and Antarctica.  Design  The medal is octagonal in shape with a white ribbon. The reverse of the original Arctic Medal showed a three-masted ship surrounded by ice floes. The die for the medal was engraved by Leonard Charles Wyon. A new design by Ernest Gillick was used from 1904, showing RRS Discovery, with a sledging party in the foreground. The obverse bears a portrait of the reigning monarch. The medal was originally struck in both silver and bronze. Since 1939, all awarded medals have been silver; bronze medals were presented to personnel on relief ships for Antarctic expeditions, but not awarded to participants of Arctic expeditions.  Australia  The Government of Australia replaced the Polar Medal with its own Australian Antarctic Medal in 1987. Canada The medal was awarded to members of the RCMP ship St. Roch, who patrolled extensively in the western Arctic (1940) and completed a west-to-east passage of the Arctic in 1942. Although several Canadians had received this medal, it was not included in the Canadian Honours System that was promulgated in 1967. Subsequently, a Canadian decoration intended to honour explorers of Canada's polar regions and defenders of the country's sovereignty in the north was initially conceived by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as the Governor General's Northern Medal and created on 15 September 2005, to award those who serve with distinction in northern Canada. It was replaced on 23 June 2015, by Canada's own Polar Medal. New Zealand In 1996, when New Zealand revised its royal honours system, New Zealanders ceased to receive the Polar Medal. It was proposed that the medal would be preserved, with a new name, under New Zealand regulations: the New Zealand Antarctic Medal. The rationale for the renaming was that it is in relation to Antarctica that New Zealand's endeavours and achievements have been made. The Report on honours that recommended the change contained the inaccurate claim that the medal was named after the North Pole. The new medal was formally instituted by the Queen on 1 September 2006.

The primary purpose of making a harpsichord vertical is the same as in the later upright piano, namely to save floor space. In a clavicytherium, the jacks move horizontally without the assistance of gravity, so that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those of other harpsichords. Design In any harpsichord, the strings are plucked by small plectra, held by jacks, which are thin strips of wood. In a standard harpsichord, the strings are placed horizontally and the jacks are vertical. Thus to make the jack return to position (after it has been lifted by a key to pluck) is a simple matter of gravity; with proper adjustment the jack will simply fall back into its rest position (for details and diagrams see harpsichord). A clavicytherium sacrifices this simplicity and must find some other means to make the jacks return. In some instruments, this is accomplished with a spring. Another possibility is to couple the jack mechanically to other portions of the action (e.g. keys, levers) that do return by gravity, pulling the jacks back with them.Hubbard 2002:294 Inevitably, neither strategy is as simple as the direct vertical drop of the jacks in a standard harpsichord. Indeed, finding a good design for a clavicytherium action is not easy, and builders repeatedly sought better solutions. Van der Meer writes, \\"no standard was ever devised, and there are nearly as many variations of it as there are instruments in existence.\\"van der Meer (1978:247) Many designs were rather unsuccessful: Ripin reports that clavicytheria often have \\"a fairly heavy touch and unresponsive action\\".Ripin 1989, 180 Describing the unusually fine clavicytheria of Delin (see below), Kottick observes \\"the action feels quite good to the fingers, which is not a statement one can always make about a clavicytherium.\\"Kottick 2002:294 A special property of clavicytheria is that the player is seated directly in front of the soundboard, at close range. Kottick notes, \\"[in] all clavicytheria, close proximity to the soundboard provides the player with an overwhelming sense of sonic immersion.\\"Kottick 2002:294 Indeed, the modern builder William Horn suggests that it is this esthetic end, not space-saving, that is the primary justification for making clavicytheria.Source: Horn web site: In shape, clavicytheria were normally like ordinary harpsichords, with the left side longer than the right to accommodate the long bass strings. Occasionally, symmetrical clavicytheria were made, with two bentsides and the peak in the middle; this is sometimes called a \\"pyramid\\" shape. The pyramidal design was a challenge to builders, as Ripin notes: \\"Difficulties arise, since the longer bass strings are in the middle and the treble strings are at the sides, and system of intermediate levels (rollerboard) is required to permit each key to play the correct string unless diagonal stringing is used.\\"Ripin 1989, 180 Except in the early period of their construction, clavicytheria were tall. William Horn warns potential buyers that they will need 280 cm. of room below their ceilings (nine feet two inches) to accommodate his Delin replica.Source: Horn web site, cited above The Instrument Workshop, offering plans for a Delin-based instrument, actually reduces its height to 262 cm. (eight feet seven inches) in order to \\"adapt Delin’s design to modern interiors\\".Source: the firm's website at The RCM clavicytherium The clavicytherium in the Royal College of Music, London The earliest harpsichord known, dating from about 1470, is a clavicytherium. It may have been built in Ulm, and currently resides in the musical instrument collection of the Royal College of Music in London. It is a fairly small instrument (about four feet eight inches tallRipin (1989:180); more precisely: \\"142.5 cm., including a stand of 6.9 cm.\\") with a short compass, just 41 notes. The apex forms a sharp edge, as there is no tailpiece. Kottick observes that the RCM instrument closely resembles another (unpreserved) clavicytherium found as a diagram in the work of Henri Arnaut de Zwolle.Kottick (2002:25) Ripin describes its \\"unique and simple action\\" thus: \\"the key, a vertical lever and the forward- projecting jack are all assembled into a single rigid piece. When the key is depressed the entire assembly rocks forward so that the jack (moving along the path of an arc) is forced past its string; when the key is released, the assembly falls back again under its own weight, returning the jack to its original position.\\"Ripin (1989:180) Kottick remarks that \\"the RCM clavicytherium is a refined and sophisticated instrument, which suggests that it represents a mature tradition\\".Kottick 2003:25 Indeed, since the harpsichord was probably invented before 1400,Perhaps by Hermann Poll; Kottick (2003:10) the RCM instrument probably reflects several decades of development. Later clavicytheria Clavicytherium by Albertus Delin. Now in the Musée des Instruments de Musique in Brussels Clavicytheria are mentioned in Sebastian Virdung's 1511 work Musica Getutscht, the first surviving reference work on music; Virdung calls the instrument clauiciterium.Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, entry \\"Clavicytherium\\". They are also mentioned in the Syntagma Musicum (1614-1620) of Michael Praetorius, the Harmonie universelle (1637) of Marin Mersenne, and in the French Encyclopédie méthodique.Hubbard 1967, 77 Bartolomeo Cristofori, who invented the piano, built clavicytheria, of which one may actually survive.It is in the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali in Rome; Kottick (2002:500) considers the attribution to Cristofori to be \\"probable\\". In the 18th century particularly fine clavicytheria were made by Albert Delin (1712–1771), a Flemish builder who worked in Tournai.Hubbard 1967, 77; Chung 2005 Chung describes his work thus: \\"[he] succeeded in overcoming the difficulties of building an upright harpsichord better than any other builder. His three instruments, which are considered by many to be the finest of all surviving clavicytheria, have an amazingly fine touch that is achieved by a special action that upon the release of the keys allows the jacks to return without the need of springs or additional weights.\\"Chung 2005 The city of Dublin also apparently enjoyed a vogue in the 18th century for clavicytheria, and quality instruments were made by a number of builders. Instruments survive today built by Ferdinand Weber (1715-1784), Henry Rother (f. 1762-1774), and Robert Woffington (d. 1823). The instruments by Rother and Weber are pyramidal.Kottick (2002:381-382) The clavicytherium became temporarily extinct along with the horizontal harpsichord around the end of the 18th century. The 20th-century revival of the harpsichord has seen the construction of a small number of new instruments; Kottick, writing of the revival as of 1987, said \\"The clavicytherium does not seem to have caught on much at all\\", though a few modern builders, noted above, have constructed them.Kottick (1987) Nomenclature Keyboard instrument scholar A. J. Hipkins attributed the name \\"clavicytherium\\" to Virdung. It is a Latino-Greek compound, from Latin clavis 'key' and Greek cythara; the latter denoted a variety of stringed instruments.Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, entry \\"Clavicytherium\\". In other languages the instrument is called clavecin verticale (French), Klaviziterium (German), cembalo verticale (Italian). ReferencesSources *Chung, David. 2005.

The recordings are usually audio, video or computer data. It is colloquially known as 'f-forwarding'. On media control symbols, such as player buttons and interfaces, the function is commonly represented by two solid arrows pointing right and these typical icons were correctly recognised by 75% of a sample of European consumers. This symbol is represented in unicode as .  Usage in audio  A VCR tape and player mechanism, showing the tape path in different modes. To reach a certain portion of a song, a person may fast- forward through a cassette tape by pressing a button (often labeled \\"Fast Forward\\" itself) on the tape deck containing the tape. The tape deck's motor activates at a speed higher than usual—for example, double the standard 1-7/8 ips playing speed of the 1/8\\" cassette tape—and can be stopped by the end of the tape, the pressing of a \\"Stop\\" button on the deck (or another button mechanism disengaging the button), or simply lifting a finger from the \\"Fast Forward\\" button. Fast-forwarding is the exact opposite of reminding, in which tape, music, etc., are moved backward at a user's discretion. In either operation, because of sound distortion, volume is usually muted or severely reduced. With the advent of inexpensive digital music media, fast-forwarding has most likely lost its past meaning related to the speed of a tape deck motor (or record turntable, or another device allowing fast-forwarding) and now may, especially as cassette tapes and other analogue media are used less and less by younger generations, only apply to the operation of moving ahead in a recording's time frame—accomplished today by simple clicking, dragging a slide image, or even via speech-recognition software. (Still, some CD and DVD players offer tape-style fast-forwarding, so that the user can detect when the destination is reached and stop.)  Usage in video  Analogue VCRs provided fast-forward by simply playing the tape faster. The resulting loss of synchronization of the video was accepted because it was still possible to make out approximately what was happening in the video to find the desired playback point. Modern digital video systems such as DVR and Video on Demand systems use 'trick mode' to present an apparently faster stream by only displaying selected frames. Unlike analogue video streams in which only serial access is possible, digital video allows for random access to the media, which raises the possibility of alternative fast forwarding algorithms and visualizations. In video streaming formats, such as H.264, fast forward algorithms use the I-frames to sample the video at faster than normal speed. In streaming videos, fast-forward represents a useful search or browsing mechanism, but introduces extra network overhead when non-I-frames are transmitted in addition to the viewed I-frames and extra computational complexity in the video transcoder. Finding more network bandwidth-conserving and computationally efficient algorithms for accommodating both fast-forward and normal speed viewing is an active area of research. When fast-forwarding is used as a search mechanism (sometimes called a fast-forward video surrogate) in video libraries, the question arises as to what is perceptually the best fast-forward strategy for effective browsing. The main trade-off is between the fast-forward speed and the ability to understand the video. One study concluded that a 1:64 ratio surrogate (that is, show one frame out of every 64) allowed most participants to perform adequately on a range of tasks related to video understanding. Metaphorical uses Fast-forwarding videotapes and similar is familiar enough for metaphorical uses to develop, e.g. \\"The court doesn't want to know about your aunt's bad hip. Fast-forward to when the fight started.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Audio Player's Cassette Deck Mechanism, a pictorial description of the audio cassette transport mechanism, including the fast forward mechanism Category:Audio storage Category:Graphical user interfaces ","title":"Fast forward"},{"id":"1628316","text":"Stringbean can refer to *A green bean or \\"string bean\\" *A runner bean *David \\"Stringbean\\" Akeman, banjo player *Butler May, known as \\"Stringbeans\\", American vaudeville and blues performer es:Stringbean ","title":"Stringbean"},{"id":"1628319","text":"Manuel de Zumaya or Manuel de Sumaya (c. 1678 - 1755) was perhaps the most famous Mexican composer of the colonial period of New Spain. His music was the culmination of the Baroque style in the New World. He was the first person in the western hemisphere to compose an Italian-texted opera, entitled Partenope (now lost). Life Manuel de Zumaya was born in Mexico. In 1715, he was appointed chapelmaster of Mexico City's cathedral, and was one of the first Americans to become one. He served there until 1738 when he moved to Oaxaca, where he followed his close friend Bishop Tomas Montaño against the vigorous and continuous protests of the Mexico City Cathedral Chapel Council for him to stay. Manuel de Zumaya died on December 21, 1755, in Oaxaca, where he had resided since 1738. Style His works are a multiplicity of his talents and styles. He was a master of the older Renaissance style and of the newer Baroque style. In 1711, the new Viceroy of New Spain, Don Fernando de Alencastre Noroña y Silva, Duke of Linares, a devotee of Italian opera, commissioned Zumaya to translate Italian libretti and write new music for them. The libretto of the first, La Parténope survives in the Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico in Mexico City, though the music has been lost. The Hieremiae Prophetae Lamentationes is a Gregorian-style antiquated notational piece. Zumaya authored the charmingly jolly Sol-fa de Pedro (Peter's Solfeggio) in 1715 during the examinations to select the Chapel Master at Mexico City's cathedral. Zumaya's other famous piece, Celebren Publiquen, shows his ability to handle the polychoral sound of the high Baroque era. With his distribution of the choral resources into two choirs of unequal size, he copied the style that was favoured by the Spanish and Mexican choral schools in the early 18th century. The rich textures and instrumental writing reflect Zumaya's \\"modern\\" style and are at the opposite end of the spectrum from his anachronistic Renaissance settings. Zumaya's recessional Angelicas Milicias presents his ability to superbly combine the Baroque orchestra and choir to create a sublime and stately piece in honor of the Virgin Mary. The interludio, Albricias Mortales, is done in much the same style as Angelicas Milicias. =Bibliography= * Barwick, Steven. Two Mexico City Choirbooks of 1717.

As of April 1, 2011, the city has a population of 31,565, with 13,223 households and a population density of 59 persons per km². of The total area is 538.17 km². The modern city of Akitakata was established on March 1, 2004, from the merger of the towns of Kōda, Midori, Mukaihara, Takamiya, Yachiyo and Yoshida (all from Takata District). Therefore, Takata District was dissolved as a result of this merger. It is a mountainous farming area known for many traditional events as well as certain food products. One such food product is Ebisu tea, a sweet fragrant tea, that comes from Mukaihara Town. Another is yuzu juice (柚子ジュース), a product of the Kawane area of Takamiya town in the northeastern part of the city. The city also lays claim to be the birthplace and hometown of Mōri Motonari, the Warring States-era daimyō of the 16th century. History The area of Akitakata City was originally known as Takata District (高田郡), which combined 26 villages into a single administrative unit on April 1, 1889. The area now known as Akitakata was the site of a number of fortifications during the period when Mori Motonari fought against the Amago clan. Mori Motonari himself was born in Suzuo Castle (鈴尾城) in 1497,Akitakata City Promotion Department, Commerce, Industry, and Tourism Division Historical Guide 2004 the remains of which are in the town of Yoshida. In 1500, Motonari's father, Mōri Hiromoto (毛利弘元) retired to Tajihi-Sarukake castle (多治比猿掛城), about 4 kilometers north of the family's base in Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle (郡山城), both of whose remains are also in Yoshida town. Motonari would remain based here until the age of 27 when he would return to the family base in Yoshida-Kōriyama Castle. Ikenouchi (池の内) in Koda was the site of a battle against the Amago clan on September 26, 1540. The Amago clan was defeated, and it is said that the leader, Yubara Yajirō (湯原弥二郎) committed seppuku there. A monument commemorates the occasion. Koda is also the site of the remains of Goryū castle (五龍城), of the Shishido clan (宍戸氏).The family would become tied to the Mori clan with the marriage of Motonari's eldest daughter to Shishido Takaie (宍戸隆家). Culture Kagura, an ancient traditional form of Shinto dance and music, is still alive there today. The towns of Midori and Takamiya practice the \\"new dance\\" style, which is not actually new at all, just a later emergent performance style compared to the \\"old style\\". (There is a Kagura village in Midori town called Kaguramonzentojimura where various Kagura performances and competitions begin in August and last until December.) Akitakata City is in the countryside, and still maintains many traditional local festivals. One such is Hanadaue, or rice-planting festival where men play flutes and taiko while women sing and plant rice.

In 1959, she received the Premio Nadal for Primera memoria. The third woman to receive the Cervantes Prize for her literary oeuvre, she is considered one of the foremost novelists of the posguerra, the period immediately following the Spanish Civil War.\\"Estoy cansada de repetirlo: tengo 85 años, nací en 1925 y no en 1926 como se emperran en decir\\", El País, 16 November 2010. Biography Matute was born on 26 July 1925. At the age of four she almost died from a chronic kidney infection, and was taken to live with her grandparents in Mansilla de la Sierra, a small town in the mountains, for a period of recovery. Matute says that she was profoundly influenced by the villagers whom she met during her time there. This influence can be seen in such works as those published in her 1961 collection Historias de la Artámila (Stories from Artámila), all of which deal with the people that Matute met during her recovery. Settings reminiscent of that town are also often used as settings for her other work. Matute was ten years old when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, and this internecine conflict is said to have had the greatest impact on Matute's writing. She considered not only \\"the battles between the two factions, but also the internal aggression within each side\\". Following the Nationalist victory in 1939, Francisco Franco established a military dictatorship, which lasted thirty-six years until his death in 1975. Since Matute matured as a writer in this posguerra period under the dictatorship, some of the most recurrent themes in her works are violence, alienation, misery, and especially the loss of innocence. Her work was heavily censored under Franco and she was blacklisted from working as a journalist. At least once she was fined because of her writings. She published her first story, The Boy Next Door, when she was only 17 years old. Matute was known for her sympathetic treatment of the lives of children and adolescents, their feelings of betrayal and isolation, and their rites of passage. She often interjected such elements as myth, fairy tale, the supernatural, and fantasy into her works. She was outspoken about subjects such as the benefits of emotional suffering, the constant changing of a human being, and how innocence is never completely lost. Matute was a university professor. She studied at the international school at Hilversum, Netherlands, and traveled to various countries as a lecturer or guest instructor. Her academic work in the United States spanned four decades, beginning as early as 1966 when she spoke at Our Lady of Cincinnati College. She lectured at the Tatem Arts Center of Hood College in Maryland on 28 April 1969. In 1978, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia. She was invited to speak at Brigham Young University in Utah on 12 March 1990, where she gave a lecture on Working the Craft of Translation in Spanish.Michael Scott Doyle (1993). \\"Translating Matute's Algunos Muchachos: Applied Critical Reading and Forms of Fidelity in The Heliotrope Wall and Other Stories\\". _Translation Review_. Schulte, Rainer and Dennis Kratz (eds.); ISSN 0737-4836. p. 30. She was also a guest lecturer at the universities of Oklahoma, Indiana and Virginia. She was an honorary member of the Hispanic Society of America and a member of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. She won the Premio Nadal in 1958 for the first novel of the trilogy, Los Mercaderes. Her other literary prizes included the Planeta Prize and the Café Gijón Prize.

The village has a population of 1,438. The parish includes the hamlet of Preston Bowyer. It has one public house, The Globe (The White Hart public house closed in March 2008), a convenience store, a piano dealership and workshop, a post office, a taxi service and a hairdresser. History The name of the village is believed to come from the Old English and mean settlement at the mill ford. There is evidence of a mill within the parish from the Domesday Book of 1086. These referred to the site of the Town Mills on Hillfarrence Brook. Neolithic flint arrowheads have been found to the west of the village and Bronze Age axe heads were discovered when the bypass, which opened in 1975, was being built. Just before the Norman Conquest, Milverton was granted by Edith of Wessex to Bishop Gisa of Wells Cathedral, but this was reversed by William the Conqueror. The manor was then united with Torrington in Devon passing in 1212 to William Briwere. The parish was part of the Milverton Hundred, The Old House is a Grade II* listed building dating from the late 14th and early 15th century. It was built as a residence for the archdeacon of Taunton and was once the home of Thomas Cranmer. While the house was being renovated in the early 21st century a Tudor wall painting of Henry VIII was discovered underneath the plaster and is the only one of its kind in a domestic dwelling. It has been speculated that there is a secret message in the image., which has been dated to around 1541. In 1708 there was a fire which destroyed 13 properties. Trade was largely based on cloth manufacture and in 1819 Lamech Swift established a silk throwing factory which employed up to 300 women and children. The village used to have a station on the Devon and Somerset Railway, which closed in 1966. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Wellington Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. There is an electoral ward in the name of 'Milverton and North Deane'. Milverton is the most populous village in the ward but this stretches north to Lydeard St Lawrence. The total population at the 2011 Census was 2,208. It is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Church of St Michael dates from the 13th century, on the site of an even earlier chapel, and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. Notable residents Milverton was the birthplace of Thomas Young (1773–1829), an English polymath who contributed to the scientific understanding of vision, light, solid mechanics, energy, physiology, and Egyptology. John Francis Ebdon (1876–1952) was an English cricketer born in the village. Another cricketer, Australian-born Herbert Oxley Hopkins (1895–1972) died in the village.

Visitors are provided with views of the city at Tokyo City View on the 52nd floor and an open-air roof deck on the 54th floor. Opening in October 2003, the Mori Art Museum is the centerpiece of the Mori Arts Center. Its interior was designed by Gluckman Mayner Architects, and it originally occupied the entire 53rd floor as well as a portion of the 52nd floor. The museum's galleries on the 52nd floor have since been removed, however. British-born David Elliott served as the museum's director until he resigned in late 2006, and Fumio Nanjo assumed the position. The museum is one of the only venues in Tokyo with a percentage of foreign visitors comparable to the Tokyo National Museum, but it attracts fewer visitors in total. =Office tenants= Tokyo City View Observation Deck before renovation (2013) Floors 7-48 serve as office space and house various corporate tenants, including: *Allen & Overy (38th floor) *Apple Inc.

Incidents2004 fatality= A child was killed when his head was crushed by this revolving door in 2004. While on a tour of Mori Tower on the morning of 26 March 2004, six-year-old Ryo Mizokawa was killed in a revolving door at the building's second-floor main entrance. Mizokawa's head was crushed between the door rotating from his left and the outer frame; he died two hours after reaching the hospital. The door's motion safety sensor was originally set to detect anything standing tall. This setting was changed to , however, after the door began stopping unnecessarily when detecting a newly installed, nearby safety barrier. After the incident, it was revealed that 32 people had previously sustained injuries caused by revolving doors at Roppongi Hills since the complex opened less than a year earlier. In September of the same year, in an out-of-court settlement, the Mizokawa family received a compensation payment of approximately 70 million yen from the building's operator, Mori Building Company. This sum was approximately equivalent to the cost of two doors of the type that caused the fatality. In March 2005, prosecutors indicted three people on charges of professional negligence resulting in death: senior Mori Building Co. executives Yuzo Tada and Yukihiro Koyama and an executive from the revolving door's manufacturer, Sanwa Tajima Corporation, Hisanobu Kubo. Prosecutors argued that the Mori Building officials did not implement safety measures proposed after previous incidents because they would detract from the tower's entrance appearance. All three pleaded guilty to the charges, and in September they received three-year suspended prison sentences of 10 months, 10 months and 14 months, respectively. =2007 fire= On 4 April 2007, an elevator system in Mori Tower produced a fire that destroyed part of the tower's lift-motor room and forced hundreds of people to evacuate the building. According to the elevator's manufacturer, Otis Elevator Company, a frayed cable scraping surrounding lift system components produced enough sparks to ignite a fire. After the fire, it was discovered that Otis was aware of rusted and frayed cables in the tower's elevator systems since January 2005. The incident spawned nationwide inspections of Japanese elevators by both Nippon Otis and the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. The ministry inspection of approximately 260,000 elevators turned up problems in 813 elevators. =Livedoor incident= In January 2006, one of the building's tenants, livedoor, a Japanese internet service provider, was raided by police. The incident resulted in the arrests of two executives and the company has since relocated its headquarters.

Created by Bob Haney and Nick Cardy, the character debuted in Aquaman #35 in September 1967 as a ruthless and murderous underwater-based mercenary, and he has since endured as the archenemy of the superhero Aquaman. He is also the father of Kaldur'ahm, better known as Aqualad. The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including several cartoon television series, animated movies, and video games. Black Manta made his live-action cinematic debut in the 2018 DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, portrayed by actor Yahya Abdul- Mateen II. Fictional character biography Black Manta first revealed without his helmet in Adventure Comics #452 Art by Jim Aparo. Black Manta had no definitive origin story until #6 of the 1993 Aquaman series. In this origin, the African American child who would become Black Manta grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, and loved to play by the Chesapeake Bay. Throughout his youth he was kidnapped and forced to work on a ship for an unspecified amount of time, where he was physically abused by his captors. At one point, he saw Aquaman with his dolphin friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife. Hating the emotionless sea and Aquaman, whom he saw as its representative, he was determined to become its master.Aquaman vol. 4, #6, 1993, DC Comics, writer Shaun McLaughlin An alternative version was given in #8 of the 2003 Aquaman series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta was an autistic orphan placed in Gotham City's Arkham Asylum. He felt comfortable in freezing cold water, but found cotton sheets excruciatingly painful. Because the attendants at Arkham did not know how to deal with autism, they would end up restraining him to the bed as he struggled and screamed whenever they tried putting him to bed. In this version, young Black Manta was also fascinated when he saw Aquaman on television. The boy would end up being subjected to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear the boy's head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.Aquaman vol. 6, #8, 2003, DC Comics, writer Rick Veitch As an adult, the man who would become Black Manta designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with a bug- eyed helmet, that was able to shoot rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high- tech submersible inspired by manta rays. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a formidable force, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman prior to his first appearance as a rival to the Ocean Master (and before joining the short-lived Injustice League in the retcon Silver Age third week event). His first name, David, is revealed in the 2010 Brightest Day storyline, although his last name has not been revealed. Black Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes,Adventure Comics #452, 1977 it is revealed that Black Manta is actually black, whose stated objective at one point was for black people to dominate the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land (though this goal was revealed to be a ruse he used to trick Cal Durham into following him, and this objective was not at all evident in either his earlier or later appearances). During most of his appearances, his main goals are defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of Atlantis. Finally, Manta kills Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which leaves Aquaman obsessed with revenge. Black Manta is later transformed into a human/manta ray hybrid by the demon Neron in exchange for his soul, though after a while he returns to wearing his original outfit, which covers his new appearance. At one point he engages in drug smuggling from his new base in Star City, where he is opposed by a returning Green Arrow and Aquaman. In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the Lady of the Lake's Healing Hand, reverses Neron's alterations to Black Manta and rewires Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remains a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process. In later events, Black Manta is used as a genetic manipulation test subject to make water breathers. This succeeds; since then, Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again. Black Manta causes a disturbance in Sub Diego in which Captain Marley is severely injured.Aquaman vol. 4 #39 Aquaman summons various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and leaves him for dead. It is later revealed that Black Manta was able to survive by generating an electric charge with his suit. One Year Later, he overtakes Sub Diego but is forced to flee when King Shark bites off his face.Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #52–53 (July–August 2007) When Aquaman dies at the end of the 2003 series, Black Manta begins working for Libra as part of the Secret Society of Super Villains. However, after Libra betrays the group and helps Darkseid conquer the Earth, Black Manta quits. =Brightest Day= In a 2011 Brightest Day storyline called \\"Aquawar\\", Black Manta has retired from his criminal ways. He has opened a fish market to earn an honest living. When he discovers that Aquaman has been resurrected following the end of the Blackest Night, Black Manta murders the customers in the store and burns down his shorefront house as he resumes his criminal career and vendetta against Aquaman.Brightest Day #1 (May 2010) Black Manta is seen later at the grave of Thomas Curry, Aquaman's father, where he is approached by Siren and her Death Squad after demolishing the tombstone. The Death Squad battles Black Manta, but before the fight continues too long, Siren stops them. She informs Black Manta that they need to work together to find his son, showing him a hard water image of Jackson Hyde. Black Manta and Siren locate Jackson and attempt to kill his foster father. Jackson (using his ability to create hard water constructs) fights back but is unable to stop Black Manta from shooting a trident-shaped dart at his foster father. At the last moment, Aquaman intervenes, blocking the fatal shot. Black Manta then faces his old nemesis again.Brightest Day #10 (September 2010) During the battle, Aquaman pulls Jackson and his foster father to safety.Brightest Day #11 (October 2010) In a flashback, it is revealed that Black Manta was once a treasure hunter who, along with his wife, was captured while exploring the Bermuda Triangle.Brightest Day #16 (December 2010) Their captors were the other- dimensional residents of Xebel, and the two were tortured mercilessly. The captors experimented on Black Manta's pregnant wife which gave the unborn child powers similar to those of the residents of Xebel. Fearing the child (Jackson) would be used as a pawn in an invasion of Earth, Xebel princess Mera kidnapped the child and took him to Earth, where she arranged him to be adopted and raised far away from water in order to keep him from her people. Black Manta ultimately escaped from Xebel, though his wife ultimately died. After Jackson learns the truth behind his origin, Aquaman and Jackson (now calling himself Aqualad) are ambushed by Siren and the Xebel soldiers on a California beach, where innocent citizens become caught in the crossfire. As Aquaman is about to strike back at Siren, Black Manta springs from the water and severs Aquaman's right hand.Brightest Day #19 (February 2011) Jackson attacks his father, berating him for siding with the people who killed his own wife, only for Black Manta to throw Jackson to the ground and coldly state that both he and his mother meant nothing to him. As Black Manta prepares to impale his son with one of his blades, Mera arrives with Aquagirl, who saves Jackson by striking Black Manta in the face. Jackson and Mera work together to seal Black Manta, Siren, and the rest of the invaders away in the Bermuda Triangle. Black Manta vows from within the prison to get his son, Jackson.Brightest Day #20 (February 2011) =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Black Manta kills a woman named Kahina the Seer, a former teammate of Aquaman, and steals her Atlantean relic. He then vows to kill her entire family before getting his revenge on Aquaman.Aquaman vol. 5 #7 (March 2012) A flashback shows that Aquaman created a team known as the Others (forged of six Atlantean relics from the Dead King's tomb) who are trying to catch Black Manta, but they fail and Black Manta escapes. Black Manta goes after Aquaman's former teammate Prisoner-of- War in Heidelberg.Aquaman vol. 7 #8 (April 2012) It is then revealed that Aquaman killed Black Manta's father by accident in retaliation for attacking Aquaman's father.Aquaman vol. 7 #9 (May 2012)Aquaman vol. 7 #10 (June 2012) Seeking revenge, Black Manta attempted to kill all of Aquaman's family and friends. When Black Manta chased Prisoner-of-War, he was confronted by Aquaman in a battle. During the attack, Black Manta stole one of Ya'Wara's Atlantean relics and teleported to Stephen Shin, Aquaman's former friend. Black Manta then tasered Mera and pulled Shin to him in order to teleport away. Meanwhile, the Others were reunited and discovered that there was a seventh Atlantean relic in the Dead King's tomb. Manta took Shin captive in the Dead King's tomb in order to find the seventh relic and located in the Dead King's throne.Aquaman vol. 7 #11 (July 2012) Manta prepared to kill Shin, but was thwarted when Aquaman and the Others attacked his henchmen. Black Manta killed Vostok-X and escaped with the relic scepter. After Vostok-X's death, Aquaman, through tears, swore that he would kill Manta in revenge.Aquaman vol. 7 #12 (August 2012) Black Manta delivered the relic scepter to a mysterious Atlantean, who was revealed to be his employer, but the Others ambushed them and attacked. The mysterious Atlantean managed to grab the relic scepter and escape while Black Manta was forced to battle the Others, resulting in Manta and his henchmen being taken away by the authorities.Aquaman vol. 7 #13 (October 2012) While in Belle Reve Prison, Black Manta refused to join Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad.Aquaman vol. 7 #14 (November 2012) During the Forever Evil storyline, Amanda Waller approached Black Manta again to join the Suicide Squad. Black Manta declined again at the same time as Deathstorm and Power Ring invade Belle Reve.Forever Evil #1 After hearing Amanda Waller's offer to join the Suicide Squad, Black Manta retrieved his equipment during Belle Reve's prison break and accepted the Secret Society's coin. At the Justice League's Watchtower, after claiming Aquaman's trident, Black Manta tossed the coin in the ocean. Black Manta took the trident to his father's grave stating his quest to kill Aquaman was over. Looking up, he witnessed Ultraman moving the moon in front of the sun resulting in the creation of massive tidal waves. The waves washed the grave of Black Manta's father away which gave him a new purpose: to destroy the Crime Syndicate.Aquaman vol. 7 #23.1 After retrieving Black Adam's body from the ocean, Black Manta met up with Lex Luthor, the Kryptonian clone that Lex Luthor created, and Captain Cold, where he informed them of what Ultraman's actions did to his father's grave. Lex Luthor realizes that with the help of his Kryptonian clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he might be able to stop the Crime Syndicate.Forever Evil #3 =DC Rebirth=The Drowning Black Manta's first Rebirth appearance was in the one-shot Aquaman: Rebirth #1, acting as the narrator until he reveals himself at the very end. Manta later appeared in Aquaman vol. 8, #1, in which he attacks Spindrift Station, an Atlantean embassy built by Aquaman near his hometown of Amnesty Bay to promote relations between Atlantis and the surface. Black Manta fights with Aquaman, and even wounds him, but the fight is ended with words about how hollow and empty Black Manta's purpose in life truly is. He's eventually taken into custody by the U.S. military, but the vehicle transporting him is attacked by N.E.M.O forces. A woman named Blackjack takes him to the organization's base in Antarctica, where he meets the Fisher King. N.E.M.O plans to discredit Aquaman in the eyes of the world by manipulating conflicts with the United States and other surface nations, and Black Manta decides to continue this mission after killing the Fisher King and claiming the title for himself. In Aquaman #7, Manta appears at a meeting of the N.E.M.O board in Venice, Italy, where he kills those who oppose his rule as the Fisher King and commands the Shaggy Man to attack Atlantis. Later, Manta oversees N.E.M.O's usage of Atlantean pretender forces against the U.S, which prompts the nation to declare war on Atlantis. After a team of American Aquamarines, super soldiers who can take on the form of sharks and other aquatic creatures, fails to assassinate Aquaman, the Atlantean king attacks Black Manta on his ship in the Azores in issue #15. Rather than surrender, Black Manta blows up the ship and all aboard, but Aquaman and Blackjack escape. Rise of Aqualad/Blood of Manta It is revealed that Manta survived the explosion, perhaps with the help of Blackjack, and has become obsessed with finding his illegitimate son Jackson Hyde, who has joined the Teen Titans. Manta's desire to find him stems from his remembrance of a lost relic with power over the sea itself, The Black Pearl, a weapon which can bend the very oceans to the user's whim, which once belonged to a notorious Atlantean pirate who died in Xebel. Knowing only a denizen of Xebel had the map to its keep and only Xebelian hands could unseal it, he nearly murdered Hyde's mother in order to get to him. With his son in tow, Manta and Jackson set out to find his prize, needing his son to unlock the trove that the pearl was sealed in. Eventually a clash broke out between him and the Teen Titans after achieving his goal and with it, power to dominate the world. He was finally bested by Aqualad, who near fatally electrocuted him before taking the pearl ring from his hand. The Society He's later seen having joined up with The Secret Society, who've recently sent for Deathstroke due to previous misconduct against fellow member Deadline. Powers and abilities Black Manta possesses a keen scientific mind and is an expert in mechanical engineering and military tactics. Despite being a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman, he generally relies more on technology and strategic planning than direct physical confrontations. As a result of the serum that cured him of his autism, Black Manta possesses some degree of advanced stamina and endurance. He utilizes a nigh-invulnerable battle suit that further enhances his physical strength and durability to superhuman levels, allowing him to lift and throw cars with ease. Due to this, David with his suit, can lift additional 5000 Ibs more than without the suit. This armor is adapted to an oceanic environment, providing complete resistance to deep sea pressures and granting Black Manta the ability to breathe underwater. The suit also includes a jet pack propulsion system that functions in or out of water, a telepathic scrambler, and a wide array of different weapons and gadgets including twin swords, a hand trident, a wrist-mounted speargun on the right arm, a harpoon, deployable miniaturized torpedoes, and a diving helmet that can discharge powerful optic blasts from the eye lenses. Black Manta often uses unique vehicles, such as a modified manta ray-shaped submarine, for traveling underwater. At one point, Black Manta was transformed by the demon Neron into a human-manta ray hybrid in exchange for his soul, which allowed him to breathe underwater without the use of his suit. This transformation has since been undone by Aquaman. For a brief time, Black Manta possessed a powerful mystical relic named \\"The Black Pearl\\", a powerful Atlantean artifact that allowed him to control the oceans at will. Other versionsJustice= Black Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 Justice miniseries by Alex Ross and Jim Krueger as part of the Legion of Doom. This version appears to be based on the time period when Black Manta fought for African Americans as shown by all of his henchmen being black and his city being completely populated by African Americans. He is first seen luring Aquaman into an ambush and controlling Aquaman's sharks into attacking him before taking Aquaman to Brainiac. When Lex Luthor makes his speech to the world to join him in saving it, Black Manta is one of the villains alongside him. As the Legion begins kidnapping the people close to the heroes, Black Manta takes control of Garth and forces him to assault Mera and kidnap Aquaman's son. During the Justice League's attack on the Hall of Doom, Black Manta faces off against Aquaman for the entire battle. Black Manta is one of the few villains to escape the Justice League and teleport to his city along with Aquaman's son, who follows behind him. Aquaman eventually finds Black Manta's hideout, but Black Manta's men savagely beat him in front of his son, comparing it to the treatment of his own people. Aquaman counters Black Manta is doing the same by using Doctor Sivana's technology to control his men, smashing the pack on Black Manta's suit to free his henchmen from Black Manta's control. Black Manta realizes that Aquaman was right, but makes one last effort to kill him in desperation. He is quickly struck down by Aquaman, saying that Black Manta never really had a chance to begin with. =JLA/Avengers= Black Manta appears in JLA/Avengers #4 where he is shown trapped by Plastic Man. =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Black Manta was an inmate at the Doom prison before the prison break.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #2 (July 2011) In other mediaTelevision= * Black Manta appeared in the Aquaman cartoon in The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, voiced by Ted Knight. * Black Manta (simply referred to as \\"Manta\\") appeared in The All-New Super Friends Hour, voiced again by Ted Knight. * Black Manta appeared as a member of the Legion of Doom in Challenge of the Super Friends, voiced by Ted Cassidy. * Black Manta was originally set to appear in the Justice League animated series as the mercenary that Orm hires to assassinate Aquaman; this role is ultimately given to Deadshot as it was considered \\"inappropriate\\" for his character. * Devil Ray is prominently featured in Justice League: Unlimited, voiced by Michael Beach.

In the episode \\"The Fix\\", Psimon is sedated by Tigress, who covers up by suggesting Miss Martian might have booby-trapped Aqualad's mind. Tigress and Deathstroke successfully capture Miss Martian, and Black Manta forces her to restore his son's mind or else Deathstroke will make Miss Martian's inhibitor collar explode, though he also says to Tigress he will kill her regardless if she succeeds or not.

Invented by researchers at DuPont, Krytox oils are fluorocarbon ether polymers of polyhexafluoropropylene oxide, with a chemical formula: F−(CF(CF3)−CF2−O)n−CF2CF3, where the degree of polymerization, n, generally lies within the range of 10 to 60. DuPont Krytox Performance Lubricants Product Overview, available online here These compounds are collectively known by many names including perfluoropolyether (PFPE), perfluoroalkylether (PFAE) and perfluoropolyalkylether (PFPAE). A unique identifier is their CAS registry number, 60164-51-4. In addition to PFPE, Krytox grease also contains telomers of PTFE and in fact was designed as a liquid or grease form of PTFE. It is thermally stable, nonflammable (even in liquid oxygen), and insoluble in water, acids, bases, and most organic solvents. It is nonvolatile and useful over a broad temperature range of or higher. Its high resistance to ionizing radiation makes it useful for the aerospace and nuclear industries.

The island is ten miles (16 km) long and from one to three miles (5 km) wide, located between St. Catherine's Sound and Sapelo Sound. The island is approximately 22,265 acres. About half of the island is salt marsh. Half of the remaining acreage is wooded, and there are fine beaches on the northeast and south sides. It is owned by the Saint Catherines Island Foundation and is not open to the public, aside from the beach below the mean high water line.http://www.sherpaguides.com/georgia/coast/central_coast/st_catherines_island.html History The island has been inhabited for at least 4000 years, and was a Guale settlement by 1576. It was the site of the first Spanish outpost in Georgia. By 1587 it was the northernmost permanent Spanish outpost on the Atlantic Coast. Spanish colonies were planted as far north as Chesapeake Bay, but none lasted more than a year or two. During the 17th century, the mission of Santa Catalina de Guale, located on the island from 1602 to 1680, was the center of the Guale missionary province of Spanish Florida. David Hurst Thomas has focused on Spanish period mission archaeology on St. Catherine's Island. Currently, archaeology of the shell ring on St. Catherines Island is spearheaded by David Hurst Thomas and Matthew C. Sanger. The archeological excavations at the shell ring have uncovered copper objects closely corresponding to those found at hunter-gatherer sites in the Great Lakes region, suggesting that traders may have travelled all the way from the Midwest to St Catherines Island. Mary Musgrove obtained a crown grant for St. Catherines Island in 1759. In 1766 the island was leased by Button Gwinnett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. It was run as a plantation for nearly a century, until the Civil War ended. During the Civil War, the island was granted to the Freedmen's Bureau by Sherman's Special Field Orders No. 15. On the island, the agent Tunis Campbell, dubbed \\"the most feared man in Georgia\\", established a government with schools. He also established a militia that worked to keep white people off the island. In the Fall of 1865, after Congress repealed Sherman's Orders, African-American Union soldiers were sent to evict Campbell from his island, as he would not fire upon other blacks. The 1893 Sea Islands Hurricane caused catastrophic destruction, sweeping seawater across the entire island. Only one person who remained on the island survived, and all buildings were destroyed. In 1943 Edward John Noble bought the island, using it to raise Angus cattle. In 1968, ten years after his death, the island was transferred to the Edward J. Noble Foundation. The island is now owned by the St. Catherines Island Foundation, and the island's interior is operated for charitable, scientific, literary, and educational purposes. The foundation aims to promote conservation of natural resources, the survival of endangered species, and the preservation of historic sites, and to expand human knowledge in the fields of ecology, botany, zoology, natural history, archaeology, and other scientific and educational disciplines. The island is involved with the conservation of the ring-tailed lemur. It was declared a National Historic Landmark (and automatically placed on the National Register of Historic Places) in 1969. and Clark Spencer Larsen has also collaborated extensively with David Hurst Thomas to study the bioarchaeology and biocultural history of St. Catherines Island and the greater La Florida region. The destructive analysis of human remains during the study is widely viewed as unethical.

Norwich University of the Arts was founded as Norwich School of Design in 1845 and has a long history of arts education. It gained full university status in 2013. NUA is the smaller of two universities in Norwich, the other being the University of East Anglia. History The history of the university dates back to 1845 when the Norwich School of Design was established to provide designers for local industries. Its founders were the artists and followers of the 'Norwich School of Painters', the only provincial British group to establish an international reputation for landscape painting. Degree-level provision has been offered since 1965, when it was approved to offer the Diploma in Art and Design, validated by the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design (NCDAD). After 1965 the School of Art made its own mark on the national art and design scene when twin strengths in Painting and Graphic Design emerged under a group of exceptional practitioners and teachers. From 1975, after NCDAD's merger with the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), the School offered its first BA Honours degree courses in Fine Art and Graphic Design, validated by CNAA. In 1989 the School merged with Great Yarmouth College of Art to form the Norfolk Institute of Art and Design (NIAD). In 1991 Norfolk Institute of Art and Design become an Associate College of the new Anglia Polytechnic with the polytechnic assuming validation responsibilities from CNAA from September 1992. This agreement extended to postgraduate provision, with the first MA course being introduced in 1993 (MA Fine Art) and the first research degree student being registered in 1995. In 1994 NIAD was incorporated as a Higher Education Institution (HEI), renamed as Norwich School of Art and Design and re-launched with a new corporate identity. In November 2007 the School was granted the power to award its own degrees up to Masters level and was renamed Norwich University College of the Arts. In January 2013 the institution was given permission by the Privy Council to become a university and became Norwich University of the Arts. Buildings Duke Street building which houses the library and students' union. The university campus comprises eleven buildings located in Norwich city centre. Francis House which is located on Redwell Street is the main reception for NUA, while the majority of academic facilities are a two-minute walk away, along the pedestrianised St Georges Street, with additional sites on the neighbouring Duke Street and St Andrews Street. Teaching facilities include a large Apple Mac and Windows suite, A1 style printing rooms, wood and metal workshops with a functioning forge, stop- motion animation studios, professional sound booths, open-plan design and illustration studios, constructed textiles and fashion workshops, lecture theatre and comprehensive library. There are three areas of accommodation for year one students: the newly developed All Saints Green halls of residence comprising a total of 228 rooms, the Beechcroft complex off Sprowston Road and Harvard Court. Organisation and structure The Vice-Chancellor is Professor John Last and Chancellor is the British filmmaker Amma Asante. Academic profile Undergraduate courses are offered in a range of art and design fields, including Animation, Architecture, Design for Publishing, Fashion, Fashion Communication and Promotion, Film and Moving Image Publishing, Fine Art, Games Art and Design, Graphic Communication, Graphic Design, Illustration, Photography, Textile Design and VFX.

It was written in 1893 but the strict British censorship laws at the time meant that it was not produced on stage until 1902. It is one of the three plays Shaw published as Plays Unpleasant in 1898, alongside Widowers' Houses and Mrs Warren's Profession. The volume was written to raise awareness of social problems and criticize capitalist behaviour. The influence of Naturalist playwrights is evident by Shaw's constant reference to Ibsen in the play. The Naturalist theatre movement was a reaction to Melodrama, the Victorian theatre tradition of the time. Shaw wrote two endings for this play; the first ending, with divorce as its main theme, was discarded on the advice of a friend, the second ending resulting in a more conventional marriage. It is the latter that is usually performed or published, though the former is the more in keeping with Shaw's tendencies to criticize contemporary society.Weintraub, Stanley. \\"Shaw For the Here and Now\\" contained in Shaw:The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies, vol.25. University Park: Penn State, 2006. Characters *Leonard Charteris *Mrs Grace Tranfield *Julia Craven *Colonel Daniel Craven, v.c. *Mr Joseph Cuthbertson *Sylvia Craven *Dr Paramore *The club page Plot “A lady and gentleman are making love to one another in the drawing room of a flat in Ashley Gardens in the Victoria district of London.” The lady is a young widow, Grace Tranfield, in love with the man, Leonard Charteris, who is the ‘philanderer’ of the title. Grace is shocked and disconcerted to find that Charteris, on his own light‐hearted admission, has been in a similar position with Julia Craven and others. The affair with Julia, in fact, has never been broken off. He maintains that it is not his fault that half the women he speaks to fall in love with him; and he is in full flight of cajolery when Julia Craven herself erupts on to the scene, attacks Grace, and announces her intention of staying until Charteris has given her up. Charteris gets Grace out of the room and unsuccessfully reminds Julia of her supposedly advanced views on marriage. She changes from belligerence to pleading tears, without effect, and, to the consternation of both, the fathers of Grace and Julia enter together. Colonel Craven is suffering from a liver complaint, and much to Charteris’ impatience \\"has fully made up his mind not to survive next Easter\\", just to oblige the doctors. Cuthbertson, Grace’s father, is a dramatic critic and theatrically shocked to discover something of the Charteris‐Grace‐Julia triangle; but Charteris explains it is Grace whom he wants to marry. The scene changes to the Ibsen Club, of which most of the characters are members. A fashionable physician, Dr. Paramore, says he has made a discovery concerning Col. Craven’s fatal complaint, but horrifies Craven’s younger daughter Sylvia by his practice of vivisection. Craven turns up at Cuthbertson’s invitation, and Charteris outrages both men by admitting he had lied to them last night: the truth is, both young women want to marry him, but he does not want to marry either. Julia enters the Club with Paramore dancing attendance, and manages to trap Charteris alone. She is, however, forced to retire by Sylvia, who delights Charteris by saying Dr. Paramore is in love with Julia. Charteris attempts to flirt with Grace again but is repulsed, and attention is diverted by the distraught Dr. Paramore who has learnt in the British Medical Journal that his ‘discovery,’ Craven’s liver complaint, is a disease which doesn’t exist. He complains of lack of animals for experiment, and resents Craven’s delight at learning he is not to die. Charteris, to cheer him, suggests that Julia is fascinated by him, but it is Grace who comes in first and retires with the doctor privately. Changing tactics, Charteris points them out to Julia, arousing her jealousy. The result is another quarrel between Julia and Grace, who threatens to have Julia expelled from the Club. Julia hurries after Dr. Paramore, to enlist him as a witness in her favor, and Charteris tries to prevent the others following, in order to give the doctor time to propose to her. This Paramore does, at his house, and Julia, dubious but flattered, accepts him before the others arrive. Charteris is delighted, and Julia and Grace, reconciled, congratulate each other on having escaped him. Nevertheless, Julia bitterly regrets not being brave enough to kill Charteris. An alternate, and in fact Shaw's original, ending was preserved in manuscript, though not performed until the 1990s. In it the scene at Paramore's house takes place four years later, after his marriage to Julia, when Paramore has tired of Julia and she of marriage. Paramore has fallen in love with Grace and asks Charteris's advice. Eventually, Craven, Cuthbertson and Julia join them and Cuthbertson is persuaded to suggest a solution - divorce, though difficult to obtain in Victorian England without scandal and deceit, is quite easily obtained in South Dakota. Grace joins them, and after a new row between her and Julia, all is agreed. Julia and Charteris are left alone, she presses him to marry her once she is free, but he refuses on the grounds of being a philanderer and no fit husband, and they agree to return to their former ways. In performance The play was intended for Cyril Maude, and it was put into rehearsal at the Haymarket Theatre in the winter of 1897, but was never produced. It was privately performed on 20 February 1905, at the Cripplegate Institute. The first West End performance was on 5 February, 1907 at the Royal Court Theatre. Shaw directed the first known Broadway production in 1913-14, which was performed at the Little Theater and featured E. J. Ballantine, Reginald Besant, Reginald Dance, Ernita Lascelles, Mary Lawton, Charles Maude, Muriel Reddall and W. R. Stavely. The National Theatre performed the play in 1978–79, directed by Christopher Morahan in the Lyttelton Theatre.

He is chiefly remembered today for his involvement in the Amistad case and as the father of theoretical physicist Willard Gibbs. Early life and education Gibbs was born in Salem, Massachusetts, into an old New England family with a rich scholarly tradition. His parents were Henry and Mercy (Prescott) Gibbs. One of his ancestors, Samuel Willard, had served as acting President of Harvard College from 1701 to 1707. Gibbs graduated from Yale College in 1809 and was a tutor there from 1811 to 1815. He then moved to Andover, Massachusetts, and pursued private studies in Hebrew and the Bible, guided by Moses Stuart.Muriel Rukeyser, Willard Gibbs, (New York: Doubleday, Doran, 1942), ch. VI. He returned to Yale in 1824 as lecturer in the Theological Institution of Yale College, later becoming a professor in the department of sacred literature (within the Yale Divinity School), a post he retained until his death. Academic career Gibbs was an ordained minister of the Congregational church and a licensed preacher, though he rarely appeared at the pulpit. His work increasingly focused on linguistics and was strongly influenced by the grammar of James Harris and by German scholars such as Wilhelm Gesenius and Karl Becker. He twice attempted to translate into English a new lexicon of Hebrew published in Germany, only to discover that another scholar had completed the task while he was still working at it. These experiences motivated him to learn other languages and to broaden his horizons as a linguist.Marina Fisher, \\"Amistad and Yale: The Untold Story\\", Yale Standard, 3 Mar. 2012 Gibbs's most important work, Philological Studies, appeared in 1857. He collaborated with James Gates Percival on a revision of Noah Webster's dictionary, and he compiled vocabularies of Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, as well as several American Indian languages. He also served as the librarian of Yale College from 1824 until 1843. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1826.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Involvement in the Amistad case Gibbs was an active abolitionist and he played an important role in the Amistad trials of 1839–40. By visiting the African passengers in jail and showing them piles of pennies, he was able to learn to count to ten in the language spoken by most of them, which turned out to be Mende. Gibbs then strolled around the harbors in New Haven and New York City, counting out loud from one to ten in the words he had learned from the Africans. In this way he eventually met two British sailors, James Covey and Charles Pratt, who recognized the words. The sailors taught some Mende to Gibbs and to fellow Yale professor George E. Day, enabling them to converse with at least 20 of the captives. Profs. Gibbs and Day testified as expert witnesses during the trial, establishing that the claim by the owners of the Amistad ship that the black passengers were slaves born in Cuba was patently false. Covey served as an interpreter for the Africans, allowing them to tell their story and to defend themselves from the charges of mutiny and murder.Douglas Linder, Biography of Prof. Josiah Gibbs, Famous American Trials: Amistad Trial Gibbs later compiled and published vocabularies on Mende and other West African languages. Personal life Gibbs married Mary Anna Van Cleve in September 1830 and was the father of four daughters, and one son, the renowned scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs Jr. Both father and son died in New Haven and are buried in Grove Street Cemetery there. In popular culture Gibbs was portrayed by Austin Pendleton in the 1997 film Amistad, directed by Steven Spielberg.

The large gable-wall murals by the Bogside Artists, Free Derry Corner and the Gasyard Féile (an annual music and arts festival held in a former gasyard) are popular tourist attractions. The Bogside is a majority Catholic/Irish republican area, and shares a border with the Protestant/Ulster loyalist enclave of the Fountain. HistoryThe Troubles= The area has been a focus point for many of the events of the Troubles; in 1969, a fierce three-day battle against the RUC and local Protestants—known as the Battle of the Bogside—became a starting point of the Troubles. Between 1969 and 1972, the area along with the Creggan and other Catholic areas became a no-go area for the British Army and police. Both the Official and Provisional IRA openly patrolled the area and local residents often paid subscriptions to both. On 30 January 1972, a march organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association against internment that was put into effect the year before turned into a blood bath known as Bloody Sunday. The British Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 protesters and injured 14 more; this resulted in a large surge of recruitment for both wings of the IRA in the city. After Operation Motorman and the end of Free Derry and other no-go areas in Northern Ireland, the Bogside along with the majority of the city experienced frequent street riots and sectarian conflict lasting all the way to the early 1990s. In 1974, the Official IRA declared an end to their armed campaign, and with volunteers on the ground already mad about the ceasefire in mid 1972, that crossed the line to hardliners. In result, Seamus Costello and other socialist militants formed the Irish Republican Socialist Movement. This new movement included the Irish National Liberation Army the paramilitary wing of the IRSM. Derry and particularly the Bogside became one of many strongholds for the INLA; in fact all three volunteers who died in the 1981 Irish hunger strike were from Derry or County Londonderry. The Irish People's Liberation Organisation, a breakaway group of the INLA, made a small but effective presence in Derry engaged in a feud with the INLA in the city along with other areas in Ireland from 1987 to 1992. The feud ended with the Provisionals stepping in and killing the main Belfast leadership while letting the rest of the organisation dissolve in the rest of Ireland. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, the Bogside became relatively peaceful compared to other localities of Northern Ireland at that time such as Belfast, even though street riots were still frequent. =Subsequent history= Today the Bogside has experienced much change. It has seen minimal redevelopment compared to other areas in the city but 21st century houses are somewhat known throughout the area. The area is also a stronghold for dissident republican activity. The area after the Belfast Agreement has always been known to frequent street riots but the largest since 1998 were the 2011 Northern Ireland riots. The riots took place in other parts of Northern Ireland but in Derry city they were mostly in the Bogside. The vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs formed in 2008 has a very strong presence in the Bogside. The group's goal is to use punishment shootings and even kill any suspected drug dealers.

The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services. Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the eleventh largest American homebuilder and is one of the largest homebuilders in New Jersey, as of December 2018. Company operations Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. has delivered in excess of 336,000 houses since incorporation including 5,831 homes in fiscal 2018, with base prices ranging from $144,000 to $2,252,000 and averaging about $393,000. It operates in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Members of the Hovnanian family, including Ara K. Hovnanian, have voting control more than 50% of the votes as of January 29, 2018 equivalent to a stake worth $178 million in 2015. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to a new building on the banks of the Navesink River in Red Bank, New Jersey, in 2006. In 2018 the corporate headquarters was relocated to Matawan, New Jersey. Also in 2018, Hovnanian moved to default on debts in a manufactured default deal with the Blackstone Group which would benefit through Credit Default Swaps, in exchange for a sweetheart loan from Blackstone. History In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers - Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovananian - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey. Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families. A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers. In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, \\"There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization.\\" In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises. Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989. An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities. It remains one the United States' largest builders of \\"active adult homes\\", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities. Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian. He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian. However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009. Ara Hovnanian is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and led the company through 19 acquisitions of smaller builders from 1999 through the early stages of the housing crisis. The company relied heavily on debt to fund the acquisitions. However, falling property prices has forced the company to write off more than $2.6 billion of its value since 2006. As of October 2018, the company's debt load is $1.5 billion and interest payments amount to about $40 million per quarter. Quality Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored. K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million.http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american- mortgage-review.html The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company. http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage- reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html K.

History Stagecoach in Hull and East Yorkshire Motor Services buses at Hull Paragon Interchange in May 2009 Greater Manchester Transport buses at Victoria Bus Station, Manchester in December 1978 Buses competing for passengers in Stockton-on-Tees in February 1988 At its peak in the 1950s, the London Transport Executive owned a bus fleet of 8,000 buses, the largest in the world. In the early 1980s much of the British bus network was in public ownership, either by the state owned National Bus Company or by municipal owned bus operators. It was regulated with operators not subject to competition. The Thatcher Government commissioned a white paper into the bus industry. This resulted in the implementation of the Transport Act 1985 on 26 October 1986 and the deregulation of bus services in England, Scotland and Wales. Deregulation did not apply to London Buses which in April 1989 was split into 11 quasi-independent companies that were privatised in 1994/95.The Sale of London Transport's Bus Operating Companies National Audit Office December 1995 The Act abolished road service licensing and allowed for the introduction of competition on local bus services for the first time since the 1930s. To operate a service all an accredited operator was required to do was provide 56 days' notice to the Traffic Commissioner of their intention to commence, cease or alter operation on a route. Almost immediately existing operators faced competition on their most profitable routes, both from new and existing operators, and other municipal operators seeking to increase revenue. This would often result in the incumbent operator retaliating by starting up operations on the new operator's home turf. Tactics included cutting fares and operating extra services. It also provided for the privatisation of the National Bus Company which was divided into 70 separate legal entities and sold, with the sale of National Coach Holidays to Shearings in July 1986 the first.Holidays leads NBC sell-off Commercial Motor 19 July 1986 Many were sold in management buyouts, including some 24 which introduced employee ownership in the form of employee share ownership plans.http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=773:british- bus-deregulatiion However they quickly began to be bought out by transport companies Arriva, First, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach. The Act required that operators be run at arm's length from local authorities and thus their operations were transferred to separate legal entities. EffectsBus wars = Intense competition sometimes resulted in a bus war, requiring the intervention of the authorities to stamp out unscrupulous or unsafe practices. In 1988 Southern Vectis became the first operator to attract the interest of the regulators when the Office of Fair Trading forced it to allow competing operators access to Newport bus station.Vectis forced to share Commercial Motor 25 February 1988 It was also reprimanded for operating extra services purely to stifle its competition.Turner rebukes S Vectis Commercial Motor 14 April 1988 In 2000 Stagecoach Manchester was found to have been employing bus inspectors to usher passengers away from competitors' services.Stagecoach found guilty of bus war dirty tricks The Independent 3 December 2000 In 2004/05 Cardiff Bus was found to have engaged in predatory behaviour to stifle competitor 2 Travel.Bus firm predatory tactics claim BBC News 15 May 2007Cardiff Bus Office of Fair Trading 2008 In 2006/07 Stagecoach Manchester and UK North engaged in a bus war on route 192 and on the Wilmslow Road bus corridor that caused traffic chaos in Manchester.Council concerns over 'bus war' BBC News 3 April 2006Bus wars: Get it sorted Manchester Evening News 15 February 2007 UK North were found to have been engaging in unsafe work practices with two managers jailed.D-Day for 'bus wars' bosses Manchester Evening News 18 April 2010 In November 2009 the Competition Commission ordered Stagecoach to sell Preston Bus after it had adversely affected competition in the area forcing Preston Bus to sell in January 2009.Preston Bus to be Sold Competition Commission 11 November 2009Company must sell 'bus war' rival BBC News 11 November 2009Stagecoach must sell Preston Bus Lancashire Evening Post 11 November 2009 Bus wars still periodically occur, in 2011 Connexions and Transdev in Harrogate were engaged in Wetherby.Bus service war erupts in Wetherby Wetherby News 8 July 2011 =Ownership= Only 12 operations remain in public ownership, the largest being Lothian Buses in Edinburgh.

It was published as a part of Plays Pleasant, which also included Arms and the Man, Candida and You Never Can Tell. Shaw titled the volume Plays Pleasant in order to contrast it with his first book of plays, Plays Unpleasant. Characters *Napoleon Bonaparte *Sub-Lieutenant *Giuseppe Grandi *Strange Lady Plot 12 May 1796, an inn at Tavazzano. After his victory at the Battle of Lodi, Napoleon eats his meal, works on his plans and talks with the innkeeper Giuseppe Grandi. A lieutenant arrives with bad news. The dispatches he was carrying have been stolen by a youth who tricked him out of them. Napoleon says he will be arrested for dereliction of duty. The lieutenant says he can hear the voice of the youth who tricked him. A woman appears. She says that the dispatches were stolen by her brother. Napoleon is unconvinced. He orders the lieutenant out and tells the woman to hand over the dispatches. A battle of wits ensues between Napoleon and the woman, but she eventually concedes and hands over the documents. However she says he should not read one of the documents. It is a letter claiming that Napoleon's wife Josephine has been having an affair with Paul Barras. If he is known to have read the letter it will cause a duel. Napoleon, concerned about a public scandal, decides to pretend that the dispatches are still missing. He calls the lieutenant back, and tells him to go and find the missing documents or be court martialed. To save the lieutenant from disgrace, the lady leaves and switches to her male disguise. As soon as she reappears the lieutenant recognises the \\"brother\\" who robbed him. Pretending to have magical powers, she finds the dispatches in Napoleon's coat. Napoleon says he's been outwitted by an Englishwoman, and makes a series of comments about the English ability to constantly have things both ways (\\"As the great champion of freedom and national independence, he conquers and annexes half the world, and calls it Colonization\\"). He gives the woman the letter unopened; she burns it. Productions The play was written for Ellen Terry and Richard Mansfield, but was first performed, on 1 July 1897, at the Grand theatre, Croydon with Murray Carson and Florence West in the principal roles.Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.225. The play was the first Shaw work performed in the German language when it was given in a translation by Siegfried Trebitsch at the Schauspielhaus in Frankfurt on 20 April 1903. On 28 March 1928, the play had its first radio broadcast with Esme Percy as Napoleon. The play was revived at The Pentameters Theatre in Hampstead in April 2013, performed in a double bill with The Fascinating Foundling. The cast included Karl Niklas as Napoleon, Seamus Newham as Giuseppe, Lucas Livesey as Lieutenant and Emma West as The Strange Lady. Directed by Michael Friend and produced by Leonie Scott- Matthews. A version of it aired on Australian television in 1963. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Playwright Jim Knable adapted the play into \\"Destiny and the Little Man,\\" which was given a world premiere production as part of \\"Nightcap Riot: Mombucha\\" in New York City in January and February 2016.

The slogan was first painted in January 1969 after an unauthorised midnight incursion by RUC men into the Bogside. Free Derry () was a self- declared autonomous Irish nationalist area of Derry, Northern Ireland, that existed between 1969 and 1972, during the Troubles. It emerged during the Northern Ireland civil rights movement, which sought to end discrimination against the Irish Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government. The civil rights movement highlighted the sectarianism and police brutality of the overwhelmingly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The area, which included the mainly-Catholic Bogside and Creggan neighbourhoods, was first secured by community activists on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the Bogside by RUC officers. Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the RUC from entering. Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the Bogside which read, \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\". For six days the area was a no-go area, after which the residents took down the barricades and RUC patrols resumed. Tensions remained high over the following months. On 12 August 1969, sporadic violence led to the Battle of the Bogside: a three-day pitched battle between thousands of residents and the RUC, which spread to other parts of Northern Ireland. Barricades were re-built, petrol bomb 'factories' and first aid posts were set up, and a radio transmitter (\\"Radio Free Derry\\") broadcast messages calling for resistance. The RUC fired CS gas into the Bogside – the first time it had been used by UK police. On 14 August, the British Army were deployed at the edge of the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn. The Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC and the British Army until their demands were met. The British Army made no attempt to enter the area. The situation continued until October 1969 when, following publication of the Hunt Report, military police were allowed in. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) began to re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were supported by the people of Free Derry. Meanwhile, the initially good relations between the British Army and the nationalist community worsened. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot dead by British troops in Derry. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971 in Operation Demetrius. In response, barricades went up once more around Free Derry. This time, Free Derry was defended by well-armed members of the IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police. Support for the IRA rose further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972, when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Parachute Regiment during a protest march in the Bogside (a 14th man was wounded and died months later). This support began to wane after the Official IRA killed a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army. Following the Bloody Friday bombings, the British decided to re-take the \\"no- go\\" areas. Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 in Operation Motorman, when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured vehicles and bulldozers.  Background  Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It has a majority nationalist population, and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections. Despite this, the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council, Londonderry Corporation, from 1923 onwards.History of the Bogside , Museum of Free Derry. Retrieved 11 April 2009. The Unionists maintained their majority, firstly, by manipulating the constituency boundaries (gerrymandering) so that the South Ward, with a nationalist majority, returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and Waterside Ward, with unionist majorities, returned twelve councillors between them; secondly, by allowing only ratepayers to vote in local elections, rather than one man, one vote, so that a higher number of nationalists, who did not own or rent homes, were disenfranchised; and thirdly, by denying council housing to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency. The result was that there were about 2,000 nationalist families, and practically no unionists, on the housing waiting list, and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition.Londonderry: One man, no vote, The Campaign for Social Justice in Northern Ireland, (19 February 1965).

The date chosen was 5 October 1968, an ad hoc committee was formed (although in reality most of the organising was done by McCann and Melaugh) and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls, where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 37 The Minister of Home Affairs, William Craig, made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the Apprentice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day. In the words of Martin Melaugh of CAIN \\"this particular tactic...provided the excuse needed to ban the march.\\" When the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) cordon. The police drew their batons and struck marchers, including Stormont MP Eddie McAteer and Westminster MP Gerry Fitt.Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland, chapter 4, paragraph 49 Subsequently, the police \\"broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in Duke Street\\". Marchers trying to escape met another party of police and \\"these police also used their batons indiscriminately.\\"Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland, chapter 4, paragraph 51 Water cannons were also used. The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry, and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) was formed, with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice-chairman.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 45 The first barricades Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People's Democracy, a group of students in Queen's University Belfast. They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights, starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969.Bowes Egan and Vincent McCormack, Burntollet (1969) (CAIN Web Service) The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter-demonstrators at several points along the route. Finally, at Burntollet Bridge, five miles outside Derry, they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs—some of them studded with nails—and stones. Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B-Specials. The police, who were at the scene, chatted to the B-Specials as they prepared their ambush, and then failed to protect the marchers, many of whom ran into the river and were attacked with stones thrown from the bank.The Sunday Times Insight Team, Ulster, Penguin, 1972, pp. 66–67 Dozens of marchers were taken to hospital. The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to Craigavon Bridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square, where they held a rally. Rioting broke out after the rally. Police drove rioters into the Bogside, but did not come after them. In the early hours of the following morning, 5 January, members of the RUC charged into St. Columb's Wells and Lecky Road in the Bogside, breaking windows and beating residents.1,500 arm to defend their area, The Irish Times, 6 January 1969 In his report on the disturbances, Lord Cameron remarked that \\"for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well-led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse\\" and added that \\"its effect in rousing passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was regrettably great.\\"Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland, chapter 14, paragraph 177 That afternoon over 1,500 Bogside residents built barricades, armed themselves with steel bars, wooden clubs and hurleys, and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area. DCAC chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no-one was to come in. Groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the streets in shifts. A local activist painted \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\" in light-coloured paint on the blackened gable wall of a house on the corner of Lecky Road and Fahan Street.See photograph at For many years, it was believed that it was John 'Caker' Casey that painted it, but after Casey's death it emerged that it might have been another young activist, Liam Hillen. The corner where the slogan was painted, which was a popular venue for meetings, later became known as \\"Free Derry Corner\\".The houses on Lecky road and Fahan Street were subsequently demolished, but the wall was retained. It has been repainted at frequent intervals, often with additional motifs, as, for instance, when the background of the mural was temporarily painted pink in July 2007 for the Gasyard Feile and Foyle Pride Week: \\"'Free Derry' is pink with pride\\", BBC News On 7 January, the barricaded area was extended to include the Creggan, another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the Bogside.Irish Times, 8 January 1969 A clandestine radio station calling itself \\"Radio Free Derry\\" began broadcasting to residents,Advice given for Derry 'Revolution', The Irish Times, 11 January 1969, page 14 playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 56 On a small number of occasions law-breakers attempted crimes, but were dealt with by the patrols.Calmer weekend in Derry, The Irish Times, 10 January 1969 Despite all this, the Irish Times reported that \\"the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols.\\" Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week, members of the DCAC including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday, 10 January and called on them to dismantle the barricades. The barricades were taken down the following morning.Derry barricades to come down, The Irish Times, 11 January 1969 April 1969 Over the next three months there were violent clashes, with local youths throwing stones at police. Violence came to a head on Saturday, 19 April after a planned march from Burntollet Bridge to the city centre was banned. A protest in the city centre led to clashes with \\"Paisleyites\\"—unionists in sympathy with the anti-civil rights stance of Ian Paisley. Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the Bogside were themselves driven back to their barracks. A series of pitched battles followed, and barricades were built, often under the supervision of Bernadette Devlin, newly elected MP for Mid Ulster.Devlin, Bernadette, The Price of my Soul, pp. 184 – 186 Police pursuing rioters broke into a house in William Street and severely beat the occupant, Samuel Devenny, his family and two friends. Devenny was brought to hospital \\"bleeding profusely from a number of head wounds.\\"Ombudsman's Report, section 3: The incident at the Devenny home (Pat Finucane Centre) At midnight four hundred RUC men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the Bogside.RUC obey Bogside ultimatum, The Irish Times, 21 April 1969 Convoys of police vehicles drove through the area with headlights blazing.Devlin, Bernadette, The Price of My Soul, p. 187 The following day, several thousand residents, led by the DCAC, withdrew to the Creggan and issued an ultimatum to the RUC – withdraw within two hours or be driven out. With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining, the police marched out through the Butcher's Gate, even as the residents were entering from the far side. The barricades were not maintained on this occasion, and routine patrols were not prevented.No major clashes in Derry, The Irish Times, 22 April 1969 Samuel Devenny suffered a heart attack four days after his beating. On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died.Ombudsman's Report, section 5: Mr. Devenny's death Thousands attended his funeral, and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual Apprentice Boys' parade, scheduled for 12 August, could not take place without causing serious disturbance.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites p. 47 August – October 1969 Westland Street, in the Bogside. The headquarters of the Derry Citizens Defence Association were at number 10. The Apprentice Boys' parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689, which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city's gates against the army of King James. At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year. Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bogside, and were often openly hostile to the residents.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 21 On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade, and to defend the Bogside and Creggan in the event of an attack. The chairman was Seán Keenan, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) veteran; the vice-chairman was Paddy Doherty, a popular local man sometimes known as \\"Paddy Bogside\\" and the secretary was Johnnie White, another leading republican and leader of the James Connolly Republican Club. Street committees were formed under the overall command of the DCDA and barricades were built on the night of 11 August.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, pp. 58 – 59 The parade took place as planned on 12 August. As it passed through Waterloo Place, on the edge of the Bogside, hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade. Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours, then the police joined in. They charged up William Street against the Bogsiders, followed by the 'Paisleyites'. They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs. The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the Bogside. Late in the evening, having been driven back repeatedly, the police fired canisters of CS gas into the crowd. Youths on the roof of a high-rise block of flats on Rossville Street threw petrol bombs down on the police.History – Battle of the Bogside , The Museum of Free Derry. Retrieved 11 November 2008. Walkie-talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DCDA headquarters in Paddy Doherty's house in Westland Street,McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 60 and first aid stations were operating, staffed by doctors, nurses and volunteers. Women and girls made milk-bottle crates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front lineBogside like war-devastated area, The Irish Times, 13 August 1969 and \\"Radio Free Derry\\" broadcast to the fighters and their families. On the third day of fighting, 14 August, the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary (B-Specials), a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere. Before they engaged, however, British troops were deployed at the scene, carrying automatic rifles and sub-machine guns. The RUC and B-Specials withdrew, and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area.Adams, Gerry, The Politics of Irish Freedom, Brandon Books, Dingle, 1986, p. 33 A deputation that included Eamonn McCann met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met, including the disarming of the RUC, the disbandment of the B-Specials and the abolition of Stormont (the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland). The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the Bogside and Creggan districts.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 64 A 'peace corps' was formed to maintain law and order. When the British Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan, visited Northern Ireland and announced his intention to visit the Bogside on 28 August, he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him. Callaghan agreed.Callaghan to enter Bogside without bodyguard, The Irish Times, 28 August 1969, page 4 Accompanied by members of the Defence Committee, he was \\"swept along by a surging crowd of thousands\\" up Rossvile Street and into Lecky Road, where he \\"took refuge\\" in a local house,McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 69 and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window. In preparation for Callaghan's visit the \\"Free Derry\\" wall was painted white and the \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\" sign was professionally re-painted in black lettering.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 68 Following Callaghan's visit, some barricades were breached, but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 120 Still the army made no move to enter the area. Law and order was maintained by a 'peace corps'—volunteers organised by the DCDA to patrol the streets and man the barricades. There was very little crime. Punishment, in the words of Eamonn McCann, \\"as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from Seán Keenan on the need for solidarity within the area.\\"McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 67 In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 121 The Hunt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland was presented to the Stormont cabinet in early October. Jim Callaghan held talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October, following which the report's recommendations were accepted and made public. They included the recommendation that the RUC should be 'ordinarily' unarmed, and that the B-Specials should be phased out and replaced by a new force. The new RUC Chief Constable, Arthur Young, an Englishman, was announced, and travelled to Belfast with Callaghan. The same day, Seán Keenan announced that the DCDA was to be dissolved. On 11 October Callaghan and Young visited Free Derry, and on 12 October the first military police entered the Bogside, on foot and unarmed.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 72 IRA resurgence The Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962. It was low in both personnel and equipment—Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding told Seán Keenan and Paddy Doherty in August 1969 that he \\"couldn't defend the Bogside. I haven't the men nor the guns to do it.\\"Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 103 During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left. Its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the Irish nationalist and unionist working classes to overthrow capitalism, both British and Irish.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA, pp. 51–54 Republican Clubs were formed in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin was proscribed.Feeney, Brian, Sinn Féin: A Hundred Turbulent Years, p. 232 These clubs were involved in the formation of NICRA in 1967.Feeney, Brian, Sinn Féin: A Hundred Turbulent Years, p. 236 In Derry, the James Connolly Republican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals, with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and Derry Unemployed Action Committee. The Derry Citizens' Defence Association was formed initially by republicans, who then invited other nationalists to join.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 58 Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like Johnnie White and the older, traditional republicans such as Seán Keenan, both sides saw the unrest of 1968–69 as a chance to advance republican aims, and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, pp. 40,42 The events of August 1969 in Derry, and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes, brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditionalists, and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA.Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 366–367 Initially, both armies organised for defensive purposes only, although the Provisionals were planning towards an offensive campaign.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 163 In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and householders commonly paid subscriptions to both.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 96 When rioters were arrested after the Officials' Easter parade in March 1970, Officials and Provisionals picketed their trial together.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 172 At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 74 Martin McGuinness, who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades, initially joined the Officials, but a few months later left to join the Provisionals.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA, pp. 144, 155 Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969. In September, after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man, William King, the British Army erected a 'peace ring' to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled. Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, pp. 136–7 Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary, there was anger among young people. Clashes between youths and troops became more frequent. The riot following the Officials' Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used 'snatch squads', who rushed into the Bogside wielding batons to make arrests.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 151 The snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations. There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random, sometimes days after the alleged offence, and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, pp. 81–2 The rioters were condemned as hooligans by moderates, who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation. The Labour radicals and Official republicans, still working together, tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organisations—one such organisation was named the Young Hooligans Association—but to no avail.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 84 The Provisionals, while disapproving of riots, viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 155 This philosophy was more attractive to rioters, and some of them joined the Provisional IRA. The deaths of two leading Provisionals in a premature explosion in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organisation. Nevertheless, up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numerically small.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 179 Two men, Séamas Cusack and Desmond Beattie, were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971. They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry. In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs, while eyewitnesses insisted that both were unarmed. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members, withdrew from Stormont in protest, but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed. The result was a surge of support for the IRA. The Provisionals held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to \\"join the IRA\\". Following the meeting, people queued up to join,McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, pp. 89–90 and there was large- scale rioting. The British Army post at Bligh's Lane came under sustained attack, and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 233 Internment and the third Free Derry The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment would be introduced in Northern Ireland, and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids. In Derry, residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests, and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere; nevertheless leading figures including Seán Keenan and Johnnie White were interned.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 92 In response, barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence. Unlike its predecessors, this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence, both Official and Provisional. It was defended by armed paramilitaries—a no-go area, one in which British security forces were unable to operate.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 236 Gun attacks on the British Army increased. Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after internment, and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed—the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry. The army moved in in force on 18 August to dismantle the barricades. A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer, Eamonn Lafferty, was killed. A crowd staging a sit-down protest was hosed down and the protesters, including John Hume and Ivan Cooper, arrested. With barricades re-appearing as quickly as they were removed, the army eventually abandoned their attempt.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites pp. 238–9 The Derry Provisionals had little contact with the IRA elsewhere. They had few weapons (about twenty) which they used mainly for sniping.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA pp.196–7 At the same time, they launched their bombing campaign in Derry. Unlike in Belfast, they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people. Eamonn McCann wrote that \\"the Derry Provos, under Martin McGuinness, had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties.\\"McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town p. 106 Although both IRAs operated openly, neither was in control of Free Derry. The barricades were manned by unarmed 'auxiliaries'.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites p. 243 Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police, which was headed by Tony O'Doherty, a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town p. 100 Bloody Sunday The Bloody Sunday memorial in Rossville Street. All of the dead belonged to Free Derry. An anti-internment protest organised by NICRA at Magilligan Camp in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (1 Para).Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA p. 207 NICRA had organised a march from the Creggan to Derry city centre, in defiance of a ban, on the following Sunday, 30 January 1972. Both IRAs were asked, and agreed, to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites pp. 279–280 The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to prevent marchers from reaching the city centre. On the day, march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to Free Derry Corner, but some youths proceeded to the barrier at William Street and stoned soldiers. Troops from 1 Para then moved into Free Derry and opened fire, killing thirteen people, all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA pp. 107–8 A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in June 1972.'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30 January 1972 – Circumstances in Which People were Killed, CAIN. Retrieved 11 November 2008. Like the killing of Cusack and Beattie the previous year, Bloody Sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the IRA, even among people who previously would have been 'moderates'.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites p. 247 February – July 1972 Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday, with the tacit support of the residents.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites pp. 247–8 Local feelings changed, however, with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA. Best was a 19-year-old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents' house in the Creggan. He was abducted, interrogated and shot. The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA p. 199 Nine days later, on 29 May, the Official IRA declared a ceasefire. The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit, but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June. Martin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of senior Provisionals who travelled to London for talks with William Whitelaw, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.Bishop, Patrick, and Mallie, Eamonn, The Provisional IRA p. 226 The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the Lenadoon estate.Bell, J. Bowyer, The Secret Army: The IRA, p. 391 Political pressure for the action against the \\"no-go\\" areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast. A British Army attack was considered inevitable, and the IRA took the decision not to resist it.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town p. 114 On 31 July 1972, Operation Motorman was launched when thousands of British troops, equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulldozers (AVREs), dismantled the barricades and occupied the area.Operation Banner: An Analysis of Military Operations in Northern Ireland, prepared under the direction of the Chief of the General Staff. Retrieved 9 April 2010. Subsequent history After Operation Motorman, the British Army controlled the Bogside and Creggan by stationing large numbers of troops within the area, by conducting large-scale 'search' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering, and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites pp. 250–1 Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe 'the war was over' in the area, although there were still frequent street riots. Nationalists—even those who did not support the IRA—remained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state.Ó Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites p. 252 Many of the residents' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972, which redrew the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single transferable vote. Elections were held in May 1973.Callanan, Mark and Keogan, Justin F., Local Government in Ireland, Institute of Public Administration, Dublin, 2003, p. 462 Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923. Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped, with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats.

It is a driver wrapper around the original Microsoft Windows NTFS file system driver using parts of ReactOS code. By taking this approach Captive NTFS aimed to provide safe write support to NTFS partitions. Until the release of NTFS-3G, it was the only Linux NTFS driver with full write support. On January 26, 2006 Jan Kratochvíl released version 1.1.7 of his package. This version restores compatibility with recent Linux kernels by replacing the obsolete LUFS (Linux Userland File System) module with FUSE (File System in Userspace), which as of Linux 2.6.14 has been included into the official Linux kernel. Captive NTFS requires NTFS.SYS which cannot be distributed for legal reasons. It can either be obtained from an installed Windows system (which most computers with NTFS partitions are likely to have) or extracted from certain Microsoft service packs.

In essence, cell adhesion molecules help cells stick to each other and to their surroundings. Cell adhesion is a crucial component in maintaining tissue structure and function. In fully developed animals, these molecules play an integral role in creating force and movement and consequently ensure that organs are able to execute their functions. In addition to serving as \\"molecular glue\\", cell adhesion is important in affecting cellular mechanisms of growth, contact inhibition, and apoptosis. Oftentimes aberrant expression of CAMs will result in pathologies ranging from frostbite to cancer. Combined with cell junctions and ECM, CAMs help hold animal cells together. Structure CAMs are typically single-pass transmembrane receptors in Membranome database and are composed of three conserved domains: an intracellular domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain. These proteins can interact in several different ways. The first method is through homophilic binding, where CAMs bind with the same CAMs. They are also capable of heterophilic binding, meaning a CAM on one cell will bind with different CAMs on another cell. The final type of binding occurs between cells and substrate, where a mutual extracellular ligand that binds two different CAMs. Families of CAMs There are four major superfamilies or groups of CAMs: the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs), Cadherins, Integrins, and the Superfamily of C-type of lectin-like domains proteins (CTLDs). Proteoglycans are also considered to be a class of CAMs. One classification system involves the distinction between calcium-independent CAMs and calcium-dependent CAMs. Integrins and the Ig-superfamily CAMs do not depend on Ca2+ while cadherins and selectins depend on Ca2+. In addition, integrins participate in cell–matrix interactions, while other CAM families participate in cell–cell interactions. =Calcium-independent= Integrins  Integrins, one of the major classes of receptors within the ECM, mediates cell–ECM interactions with collagen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Integrins provide essential links between the extracellular environment and the intracellular signalling pathways, which can play roles in cell behaviours such as apoptosis, differentiation, survival, and transcription. Integrins are heterodimeric, as they consist of an alpha and beta subunit. There are currently 18 alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits, which combine to make up 24 different integrin combinations. Within each of the alpha and beta subunits there is a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain is where the ligand binds through the use of divalent cations. In general, increases affinity, promotes adhesion to cells, and decreases cell adhesion. Integrins regulate their activity within the body by changing conformation. Most exist at rest in a low affinity state, which can be altered to high affinity through an external agonist which causes a conformational change within the integrin, increasing their affinity. An example of this is the aggregation of platelets; Agonists such as thrombin or collagen trigger the integrin into its high affinity state, which causes increased fibrinogen binding, causing platelet aggregation. IgSF CAMs Immunoglobulin superfamily CAMs (IgSF CAMs) is regarded as the most diverse superfamily of CAMs. This family is characterized by their extracellular domains containing Ig-like domains. The Ig domains are then followed by Fibronectin type III domain repeats and IgSFs are anchored to the membrane by a GPI moiety. This family is involved in both homophilic or heterophilic binding and has the ability to bind integrins or different IgSF CAMs. =Calcium-dependent=Cadherins The cadherins are homophilic -dependent glycoproteins. The classic cadherins (E-, N- and P-) are concentrated at the intermediate cell junctions, which link to the actin filament network through specific linking proteins called catenins. Cadherins are notable in embryonic development. For example, cadherins are crucial in gastrulation for the formation of the mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. Cadherins also contribute significantly to the development of the nervous system. The distinct temporal and spatial localization of cadherins implicates these molecules as major players in the process of synaptic stabilization. Each cadherin exhibits a unique pattern of tissue distribution that is carefully controlled by calcium. The diverse family of cadherins include epithelial (E-cadherins), placental (P-cadherins), neural (N-cadherins), retinal (R-cadherins), brain (B-cadherins and T-cadherins), and muscle (M-cadherins). Many cell types express combinations of cadherin types. The extracellular domain has major repeats called extracellular cadherin domains (ECD). Sequences involved in binding between the ECDs are necessary for cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic domain has specific regions where catenin proteins bind. Selectins The selectins are a family of heterophilic CAMs that are dependent on fucosylated carbohydrates, e.g., mucins for binding. The three family members are E-selectin (endothelial), L-selectin (leukocyte), and P-selectin (platelet). The best-characterized ligand for the three selectins is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which is a mucin-type glycoprotein expressed on all white blood cells. Selectins have been implicated in several roles but they are especially important in the immune system by helping white blood cell homing and trafficking. Biological function of CAMs The variety in CAMs leads to diverse functionality of these proteins in the biological setting. One of the CAMS that are particularly important in the lymphocyte homing is addressin. Lymphocyte homing is a key process occurring in a strong immune system. It controls the process of circulating lymphocytes adhering to particular regions and organs of the body. The process is highly regulated by cell adhesion molecules, particularly, the addressin also known as MADCAM1. This antigen is known for its role in tissue- specific adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelium venules. Through these interactions they play a crucial role in orchestrating circulating lymphocytes. CAM function in cancer metastasis, inflammation, and thrombosis makes it a viable therapeutic target that is currently being considered. For example, they block the metastatic cancer cells' ability to extravasate and home to secondary sites. This has been successfully demonstrated in metastatic melanoma that hones to the lungs. In mice, when antibodies directed against CAMs in the lung endothelium were used as treatment there was a significant reduction in the number of metastatic sites.

Name The name comes from *Glogovec, the Old Slavic name for a place densely overgrown by hawthorn. The Hungarian form Galgóc was adopted before a phonological change g > h in Slovak language.Martin Štefánik - Ján Lukačka et al. 2010, Lexikón stredovekých miest na Slovensku, Historický ústav SAV, Bratislava, pp. 164, . http://forumhistoriae.sk/-/lexikon- stredovekych-miest-na-slovensku History The first written evidence of its existence is from 1113, when a town with the name Galgocz was mentioned in the so-called Second Zobor Document. In 1362 Hlohovec obtained town privileges. Ottoman troops captured city and annexed it to the sanjak of Uyvar as the Holok eyalet in 1663. Austrian troops retook it in 1685. Landmarks Aerial photography of the castle The dominant building is a Renaissance-Baroque castle built in 1720. The castle is built on the place of a pre-existing Slavic settlement and a medieval castle. In the castle area is the Empire theatre built in 1802, a riding school from the 18th century, and a Baroque garden pavilion. In the middle of St. Michael Square stands the Gothic church of St. Michael with its highly decorated portal. Next to the church is the Chapel of Saint Anna from the 18th century. In the northern border of the central part of the town is the Franciscan church and monastery built in 1492. Part of the monastery premises nowadays occupies the Museum of National History and Geography. The most visited and beautiful natural part of town is the castle park with its lake, French terraces, and rare wood-species, especially old sycamore trees. Demographics According to the 1910 census the town had 7749 inhabitants: 5645 Slovaks 1401 Hungarians and 667 Germans, 83.6% of the people were Roman Catholic, 13.7% Jewish and 2.1% Lutheran. According to the 2001 census, the town had 23,729 inhabitants. 97.85% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.72% Roma and 0.63% Czechs. The religious make-up was 79.58% Roman Catholics, 14.85% people with no religious affiliation and 2.44% Lutherans.

It is 10 km (6 mi) north-north west of Montefiascone and 36 km (22 mi) north-west of Viterbo. The ancient Via Cassia, today's highway SR143, follows the lake shore for some distance, passing through Bolsena. History The Castle of Bolsena. While it is fairly certain that the city is the successor to the ancient Roman town of Volsinii (sometimes termed Volsinii Novi - New Volsinii - to distinguish it from the Etruscan city), scholarly opinion is sharply divided as to whether Volsinii was the same as the ancient Etruscan city of Velzna or Velsuna (sometimes termed Volsinii Veteres - Old Volsinii), the other candidate being Orvieto, 20 km (12 mi) NE. George Dennis pointed out that the town of Bolsena has no Etruscan characteristics; for example, Etruscan cities were built on defensible crags, which the hill on which the castle is situated is not. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder saidPliny the Elder, Natural History, II,18 that a bolt from Mars fell on Bolsena, \\"the richest town in Tuscany\\" and that the city was entirely burned up by this bolt. The population moved to another site, which Dennis thought was Bolsena. The new city was named after the old, hence Roman Bolsena has an Etruscan name. Dennis suggests a number of crags in the area including Orvieto but does not favor Orvieto on the grounds that it is too far away. Etruscan tombs A number of Etruscan tombs have been found in the vicinity of Bolsena. Funerary objects from these tombs are now located in Italy and abroad, including a fine collection in the British Museum.British Museum Collection Miracle Bolsena is known for a miracle said to have occurred in the Basilica of Santa Cristina in 1263, when a Bohemian priest, in doubt about the doctrine of Transubstantiation, reported bleeding from the host he had consecrated at Mass. The Orvieto Cathedral was eventually built to commemorate the miracle and house the Corporal of Bolsena in a reliquary made by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri in 1337-1338. A famed fresco by Raphael and his school in the Vatican Stanze depicts the event. US Navy base The United States Navy established a naval air station on 21 February 1918 to operate seaplanes during World War I. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compiègne.

These were a common sight, and Mac users of the era often kept a paper clip nearby in order to restart the computer since the onscreen restart button would usually be nonfunctional. The bomb icon has several different applications in computing, and typically indicates a fatal system error.  In computing Mac OS= The Bomb icon is a symbol designed by Susan Kare that was displayed inside the System Error alert box when the \\"classic\\" Macintosh operating system had a crash which the system decided was unrecoverable. Since the classic Mac OS offered little memory protection, an application crash would often take down the entire system. The bomb symbol first appeared on the original Macintosh in 1984. Often, a reason for the crash, including the error code, was displayed in the dialog. In some cases, a \\"Resume\\" button would be available, allowing the user to dismiss the dialog and force the offending program to quit, but most often the resume button would be disabled and the computer would have to be restarted. Originally, the resume button was unavailable unless the running program had provided the OS with code to allow recovery. With the advent of System 7, if the OS thought it could handle recovery, a normal error dialog box was displayed, and the application was forced to quit. This was helped by the classic Mac OS providing a little bit of protection against heap corruption using guard pages; if the application was to crash and the application's heap was corrupt, it could be thrown away. The debugger program MacsBug was sometimes used even by end users to provide basic (though not always reliable) error recovery, and could be used for troubleshooting purposes, much as the output of a Unix kernel panic or a Windows NT Blue Screen of Death could be. Mac OS Classic bomb boxes were often ridiculed for providing little or no useful information about the error; this was a conscious decision by the Macintosh team to eliminate any information that the end user could not make sense of. The error code was intended to be included in a bug report to the developer. In Mac OS X, the system architecture is vastly different from that in the classic Mac OS, and an application crash can not usually bring down the entire system. A kernel panic screen (either text overwritten on the screen in older versions, or simplified to a reboot message in more recent versions) replaces the bomb symbol but appears less often due to the radically different system architecture. The bomb symbol is not used in Mac OS X, but a test application called Bomb.app, specifically written to cause a non-fatal crash, is included with Xcode and uses a rendition of the bomb symbol as its icon. In the original Mac OS, the operating system call to display a \\"bomb box\\" was named DSError, and the corresponding alert table information was stored in resources of type 'DSAT'. \\"DS\\", as in the \\"DS Manager.\\" For documentation purposes, this was renamed the 'System Error Manager.' =Atari ST TOS= On the Atari ST, the four bombs indicate that the system error \\"Illegal Instruction\\" has occurred. TOS-based systems, such as the Atari ST, used a row of bombs to indicate a critical system error. The number of bombs displayed revealed information about the occurred error. The error (also called an exception) is reported by the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. The first version of TOS used mushroom clouds; this was quickly changed, as it was considered politically incorrect. * 1 bomb: Reset, Initial PC2 * 2 bombs: Bus Error * 3 bombs: Address Error * 4 bombs: Illegal Instruction * 5 bombs: Division by zero * 6 bombs: CHK Instruction * 7 bombs: TRAPV Instruction * 8 bombs: Privilege Violation * 9 bombs: Trace * 10 bombs: Line 1010 Emulator * 11 bombs: Line 1111 Emulator * 12–13 bombs: Reserved * 14 bombs: Format Error * 15 bombs: Uninitialized Interrupt Vector * 16–23 bombs: Reserved * 24 bombs: Spurious Interrupt * 25 bombs: Level 1 Interrupt Autovector * 26 bombs: Level 2 Interrupt Autovector * 27 bombs: Level 3 Interrupt Autovector * 28 bombs: Level 4 Interrupt Autovector * 29 bombs: Level 5 Interrupt Autovector * 30 bombs: Level 6 Interrupt Autovector * 31 bombs: Level 7 Interrupt Autovector * 32–47 bombs: Trap Instruction Vectors * 48–63 bombs: Reserved * 64–255 bombs: User Interrupt Vectors  References  External links  * About the System Error Handler Category:Computer errors Category:Mac OS user interface Category:Atari ST Category:Screens of death ","title":"Bomb (icon)"},{"id":"1628594","text":"Doctor Joseph Ritchie (c. 1788 – 20 November 1819) was an English surgeon, explorer and naturalist. His primary interest lay in the natural sciences, though he is best known for playing a minor role in the British exploration of Africa. Life In 1818, Ritchie was directed by Sir John Barrow to find the course of the River Niger and the location of Timbuktu. Ritchie chose subordinate George Francis Lyon to accompany him. The expedition was underfunded and lacked necessary support. Based on the recommendation of Barrow, they left from Tripoli and thus had to cross the entire Sahara, an arduous journey no modern European had ever done before. A year later, due to many delays, they had only reached as far as Murzuk, the capital of Fezzan, where they both fell ill with fever. They ran out of funds, and food, subsisting on dates and handouts from the local villagers who were little better off. Ritchie never recovered and died there, having made no new discoveries. Richie was distinctly unsuited to exploration. He was \\"deeply self-centered, morose and uncommunicative\\". After arriving in Murzuk, he cut himself off from locals and even his own people. He was reserved, took little interest in the people and places he saw, took few notes, and generally spent much of his time indoors studying mathematics. Instead of stocking food and trade goods before departing Tripoli, Richie squandered the limited expedition funds on profligate items. After Ritchie died, George Lyon opened the crates they hauled through the desert and found things like 600 pounds of lead, a camel-load of cork for preserving insects, and two camel-loads of brown paper for pressing plants. Lyon sold what he could and was able to make it back to Tripoli, alive.

This increased the amount of oxygen in the fuel mixture, and thereby improved high-altitude performance. GM-1 was used on a number of modifications of existing fighter designs in order to counter the increasing performance of Allied fighters at higher altitudes. A different system for low-altitude boost known as MW 50 was also used, although GM-1 and MW 50 were rarely used on the same engine. MW-50 was a methanol-water injection system, which injected a mixture of methanol and water into the cylinders to cool the mix. Cooling causes the air to become denser, therefore allowing more air into each cylinder for a given volume. This is the same principle that intercoolers use. GM-1 was developed in 1940 by Otto Lutz to improve high-altitude performance. It could be used by fighters, destroyers, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, though its first use was in the Bf 109E/Z fighter. Originally, it was liquified under high pressure and stored in several high-pressure vessels until it was found that low-temperature liquefied nitrous oxide gave better performance due to improved charge cooling. It could also be stored and handled more conveniently and was less vulnerable to enemy fire. GM-1 was typically sprayed in liquid form directly into the supercharger intake from two jets of different bore while at the same time, the fuel flow was increased to take advantage of the additional oxygen from the nitrous oxide. The jets could be operated individually or in combination, yielding three steps of power increase, for example 120/240/360 HP at different GM-1 flow rates (60, 100 and 150 grams/sec). The development of a continuously variable injection system was considered, but apparently it never saw operational use. Initially intended as standard equipment for the Luftwaffe, in operational service it was found that GM-1 had some drawbacks. The additional weight of the equipment reduced performance on all missions, while the system was only used in the cases where the aircraft went to very high altitudes. GM-1 also became less attractive than originally imagined when in 1943, the previous trend towards ever increasing combat altitudes ended. While GM-1 saw little use in the second half of the war, the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H, which had been developed as a dedicated high-altitude interceptor, also received a GM-1 system to provide it with superior performance at high altitude. The Ta 152H was one of the few designs to support both GM-1 and MW 50. Similar systems have been used in racing cars and hot rods.

She served as a Labour councillor and later became a campaigner and fundraiser for children's health and welfare. Early life She was born in Maidstone, Kent, where her father was a director of the Lead Wool Company, a tool company. She would chair the Maidstone Labour Party and Fabian Society. She joined the Labour Party while in her teens and met her future husband in the early 1930s at the Baptist church Sunday school where they both worked, then at the Labour Party, but they did not marry until 28 July 1938. They honeymooned in Paris and Chamonix and then returned to rent a house in Norwood. Callaghan was educated at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls, then studied cookery at Battersea College of Domestic Science. She worked as a dietician at an antenatal clinic in Greenwich during the Second World War, a young mother herself. At the same time, she studied economics at a University of London extension course in Eltham, with future Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell as tutor. She made a special study of malnutrition in children and its remedies. Career Her husband James had been elected a Member of Parliament for Cardiff in 1945 and she was at his side throughout his career. She was somewhat derided, described as \\"the Yorkshire Pudding\\", ostensibly for her skill in cooking, but also as a reference to her perceived poor dress sense and mildly disorganised appearance. She was ridiculed for her hobby of keeping pigs. She remained very private and shunned the limelight. However, she was engaged with her husband's jobs and was said to be instrumental in dissuading him from resignation after the 1967 devaluation of the pound. In 1958, Audrey was elected as the Labour member for Lewisham North for the London County Council. She took a special interest in children's homes and the Children's Committee. She was an alderman of the Greater London Council from 1964 and became chairman of Lewisham Council's children's committee, where she was also an alderman, when the GLC was abolished. In 1969 Callaghan became the chair of the board of governors of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. She continued raising funds for the hospital for the next thirty years, most notably securing an extension of copyright on Peter Pan for the hospital by a Lords amendment moved by her husband. In 1987, when James was created Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, she became Lady Callaghan. She herself declined a damehood from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. They retired to a farm in Ringmer, East Sussex, where she kept pigs and he kept cows and sheep, and grew barley. Along with her husband she supported causes relating to the University College of Swansea, of which James Callaghan was president. During her eighties, Callaghan developed Alzheimer's disease. In July 2001, when her condition had deteriorated, she entered a care home run by Catholic nuns, where her husband visited her every day until her death in March 2005, by which time they had been married for 66 years and together for well over 70. He died just eleven days after her death just a day shy of his 93rd birthday. Personal life She had three children: Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington; Julia and Michael.

Biography Dorrit Moussaieff was born in Jerusalem, Israel. Her father, Shlomo Moussaieff, was from a wealthy Bukharian Jewish family from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, part of a long dynasty of jewellers. Dorrit is the great granddaughter of Rabbi Shlomo Moussaieff. Ancestors of hers are said to have woven the robe of Genghis Khan. Her great grandmother, Esther Gaonoff, was a descendant of Yosef Maimon. Her mother, Alisa is an Austrian Jew of Ashkenazi heritage, but Dorrit identifies more with the Bukharian culture and was raised by her father's large family. Moussaieff was born and raised in the Bukharan Quarter of Jerusalem. At thirteen, she moved with her family to London. She suffered from dyslexia and was home-schooled. In addition to English and Hebrew, she also speaks German, French, and Icelandic.name= \\"Ísland er stórasta land í heimi\\" Moussaieff describes herself as \\"religious in the soul,\\" and continues to observe Jewish rituals, such as lighting Hanukkah candles. Business and media career As a child, Moussaieff spent a lot of time in her family's jewellery store on Hilton Park Lane in London, and went on to become a successful jewellery designer. Other business ventures in which she has been involved are the construction of an office building at Canary Wharf, London and a tourism project in Northern Cyprus. Moussaieff is a contributing editor to the British society magazine Tatler. First Lady of Iceland In 2003, Moussaieff married President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson on his 60th birthday. She has helped present Icelandic culture abroad, promoted Icelandic artists and identified foreign markets for Icelandic products. She is also active in raising money for disabled children. Controversy In May 2006, while visiting Israel, Moussaieff was detained at Ben Gurion International Airport after arguing with security personnel who refused to acknowledge her British passport and told her that she was obliged by Israeli law to enter and exit the country using her Israeli passport. The media related the confrontation as a diplomatic incident. The Israeli Embassy in Norway, which handles diplomatic relations with Iceland, expressed regret over the incident and restated the law that Israeli citizens must carry Israeli passports when in the country. Following the incident she applied for Icelandic citizenship which she received on 31 July 2006. In 2016, leaked files linked Moussaieff to offshore companies and trusts, suggesting that she may have been evading paying her taxes. Her lawyers claimed that, \\"her business interests were always carried out legally and they were a private matter.\\" Awards and honorsHonours=Foreign honours * : Commander Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Starhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GQP15eoieCU/VxbYQGD8edI/AAAAAAAAiUw/u8bw_NWpCd4qJBjBg4kh85kEES7lApNNgCLcB/s1600/2016-04-20-2.jpg * : Recipient of the Ruby Jubilee Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustafhttp://c7.alamy.com/comp/DEAP3X/icelands-president-olafur-ragnar- grimsson-his-wife-dorrit-moussaieff-DEAP3X.jpg * : Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustafhttp://static1.purepeople.com/articles/5/18/22/75/@/2259730-dorrit- moussaieff-les-invites-du-roi-c-950x0-1.jpg =Awards= Moussaieff was listed third on the Harper's Magazine List of the Most Connected People in Britain.

At the time of her construction, Von der Tann was the fastest dreadnought-type warship afloat, capable of reaching speeds in excess of . She was designed in response to the British . While the German design had slightly lighter guns—28 cm (11 in), compared to the 30.5 cm (12 in) Mark X mounted on the British ships—Von der Tann was faster and significantly better-armored. She set the precedent of German battlecruisers carrying much heavier armor than their British equivalents, albeit at the cost of smaller guns. Von der Tann participated in a number of fleet actions during the First World War, including several bombardments of the English coast. She was present at the Battle of Jutland, where she destroyed the British battlecruiser in the opening minutes of the engagement. Von der Tann was hit several times by large-caliber shells during the battle, and at one point in the engagement, the ship had all of her main battery guns out of action either due to damage or malfunction. Nevertheless, the damage was quickly repaired and the ship returned to the fleet in two months. Following the end of the war in November 1918, Von der Tann, along with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end in 1919 when German caretaker crews scuttled their ships to prevent their division among Allied navies. The wreck was raised in 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1931 to 1934.  Development  , one of the s that prompted Von der Tanns design The preceding German large cruiser design of the 1906 budget year, , was an incremental increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve guns, but the advent of the British , which were armed with a main battery of eight guns, outclassed the latest armored cruiser in terms of firepower. As a result, the large cruiser for 1907 would need to be an entirely new design to counter the British ships. Work on the new ship—referred to as \\"Cruiser F\\"—began in August 1906; the basic requirements for the ship was an armament of eight guns with a secondary battery of eight guns, along with a minimum speed of . Among the preliminary designs were options that carried the secondary guns either in four twin-gun turrets or in casemates in a central battery. The Construction Office, under the Naval Constructor von Eickstedt, submitted a competing proposal for a ship with six 28 cm guns and a secondary battery of guns. Senior officers disagreed over the intended role of the new ship; the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—Imperial Naval Office), Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, envisioned the new ship as a replication of the British Invincibles, mounting heavier guns, lighter armor, and higher speed with the intention of using the ship as a fleet scout and to destroy the opposing fleet's cruisers. Tirpitz had no intention of using the ship in the main battle line. Kaiser Wilhelm II however, along with most of the RMA, was in favor of incorporating the ship into the battle line after initial contact was made, which necessitated much heavier armor. The insistence upon the capability to fight in the battle line was a result of the numerical inferiority of the German High Seas fleet to the British Royal Navy. Initial proposals suggested a main battery of guns, but financial limitations necessitated the use of smaller, less expensive weaponry. The same 28 cm twin-gun turrets that had been developed for the last two s would be used for \\"Cruiser F\\". Blücher, the initial German response to the Invincible class At a conference in September 1906, many of the disagreements over the ship's design were resolved. Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21 cm or caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship to be able to engage battleships, the 28 cm guns were necessary. Admiral Eduard von Capelle, the deputy director of the RMA, stated that depending on tests of the underwater protection system slated to be carried out in November, the main battery might have to be reduced in caliber to offset the weight of any improvements to the protection system that might need to be made. Tirpitz rejected the idea of a reduction in caliber, even if it required increasing displacement over the agreed-upon . By the end of September, the design staff had submitted three basic arrangements to the Kaiser: \\"1a\\", with two twin turrets and four single turrets; \\"2a\\", with four twin turrets; and \\"5a\\", with three twin turrets and two single mounts. All three variants mounted their secondary guns in a casemate battery. The Kaiser approved \\"2a\\", which the design staff continued to refine, producing \\"2b\\" by moving the wing turrets to an en echelon arrangement that provided a theoretical broadside of all eight guns (though severe blast effects prevented this in practice). The decision was made to switch from triple-expansion steam engines to steam turbines for the propulsion system, which would increase speed to ; this produced the \\"2a1\\" variant; improvements to the protection scheme and increases to the designed horsepower resulted in the final version, \\"2c1\\". On 22 June 1907, the Kaiser authorized construction of \\"Cruiser F\\", to be named Von der Tann, after Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann- Rathsamhausen, a Bavarian general who fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The contract was awarded to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg on 26 September 1907. The ship cost 36.523 million Marks, an increase of thirty- three percent over Blücher and a doubling of the price of the previous armored cruiser . The significant increases in price caused major problems for the German fleet, as the Naval Laws that governed the construction program assumed that prices would remain fairly stable over time.  Design  CG-rendering of Von der Tann = General characteristics = Von der Tann was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of , which was increased to with the installation of anti-torpedo nets. Her draft measured forward and aft. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames and was divided into fifteen watertight compartments, with a double bottom that ran for 75 percent of the length of the hull. The ship was a good sea boat with gentle motion, though she had a slight weather helm. She was difficult to control while steaming in reverse. With the rudder hard over, she lost up to sixty percent speed and heeled up to eight degrees. Frahm anti-roll tanks were fitted during construction, but these proved to be ineffective and they only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t (200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. The ship's crew compartments were arranged such that the officers were accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement was found to be unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a lattice mast, but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, seaplane trials were conducted on Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the seaplane aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916. = Machinery = Von der Tann was the first large German warship to use steam turbines. Her propulsion system consisted of four steam turbines arranged in two sets: high pressure turbines, which ran the outer two shafts, and low pressure turbines, which powered the inner two shafts. Each shaft drove a 3-bladed screw propeller that was in diameter. The turbines were divided into three engine rooms. Steam for the turbines was provided by eighteen coal-fired double-ended water-tube boilers that were split into five boiler rooms. The boilers were ducted into two widely-spaced funnels, one just aft of the fore mast and the other amidships. Her engines were rated at for a top speed of , though on sea trials she significantly exceeded both figures, reaching for . In one instance during a cruise from Tenerife to Germany, the ship averaged for an extended period, and reached a maximum speed of . At the time of her launch, she was the fastest dreadnought-type warship afloat. She had a designed coal storage capacity of but at full load, could carry up to . This enabled a cruising radius of at . Von der Tanns electrical plant consisted of six turbo generators that had a total output of at 225 volts. Like many German capital ships, Von der Tann had chronic problems with the often low-quality coal available for the ship's boilers. Following the end of the raid on Scarborough, Von der Tanns commander, Captain Max von Hahn, remarked that \\"the inadequacy of our coal and its burning properties results in heavy smoke clouds and signals our presence.\\" During the battle of Jutland, the ship was unable to maintain fires in all of her boilers after 16:00, due to the poor quality coal. Many other German ships suffered the same difficulties during the battle, including and . After 1916, the coal firing in the boilers was supplemented by spraying tar-oil on the coal, which improved the combustion rate. = Armament = Von der Tann in 1911 Von der Tann carried eight SK L/45 guns, mounted in four twin-gun turrets: one fore, one aft, and two staggered wing turrets. The guns were emplaced in the Drh.L C/1907 turntable mount, which was traversed electrically, while the guns themselves used hydraulics to change elevation. The guns could be elevated up to 20 degrees, which enabled a maximum range of 18,900 m (20,700 yd). A refit in 1915 increased this to 20,400 m (22,300 yd). The main guns fired a 302 kg (670 lb) armored-piercing shell that had a muzzle velocity of 875 m/s; the main propellant charges were encased in a brass cartridge. A total of 660 projectiles were stored in four shell rooms, each containing 165 shells. The wing turrets were staggered in such a way that all eight guns were able to fire on broadside on a very wide arc. Unlike her British contemporaries, Von der Tann also carried a heavy secondary battery, consisting of ten SK L/45 guns, casemated in MPL C/06 pivot mounts, each with 150 high explosive and armor-piercing shells. At construction, these guns could fire their 45.3 kg (100 lb) shells at targets up to 13,500 m (14,800 yd) away; after the 1915 refit, their maximum range was extended to 16,800 m (18,400 yd). She was also armed with sixteen 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval gun SK L/45 guns, to defend against torpedo boats and destroyers. These were also emplaced in pivot mounts, of the MPL C/01-06 type, with a total of 3,200 shells for these guns. These guns fired a 9 kg (20 lb) shell at the high rate of 15 rounds per minute, up to a range of 10,694 m (11,695 yd), which was quite long for a smaller caliber weapon. In late 1916, following repair work after the damage sustained during the Battle of Jutland, Von der Tann had her 8.8 cm (3.5 in) guns removed and the firing ports welded shut. Two 8.8 cm flak guns were installed on the aft superstructure. As was customary for capital ships of the time, Von der Tann was equipped with four torpedo tubes, with a total of 11 torpedoes. These were located in the bow, the stern, and two on the broadside. The torpedoes carried a 110 kg (240 lb) warhead, and had an effective range of 2 km (1.04 nmi) when set for a speed of 32 kn (59 km/h), and 1.5 km (0.81 nmi) at 36 kn (67 km/h). = Armor = Von der Tann as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual in 1913; shaded areas represent armor protection. Because the Von der Tann was designed to fight in the battle line, her armor was much thicker than that of the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann weighed over 2,000 tonnes more than the , and used 10% more of her weight for armor than the battlecruisers she faced at the Battle of Jutland. Von der Tanns armor consisted of Krupp cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armor was 80–120 mm (3.1–4.7 in) thick forward, 250 mm (9.8 in) thick over the ship's citadel, and was 100 mm (3.9 in) thick aft. The forward conning tower was protected by 250 mm (9.8 in), while the aft conning tower by 200 mm (7.9 in). The four turrets had 230 mm (9.1 in) faces, 180 mm (7.1 in) sides, and 90 mm (3.5 in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25 mm (0.98 in) thick, and the sloping deck armor was 50 mm (2 in) thick. Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25 mm (0.98 in) thick. It was set back a distance of 4 meters (13 ft) from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.  Service history  alt=A large gray warship with four large gun turrets and two tall funnels sits idly in harbor. The keel for Von der Tann was laid down on 21 March 1908, and the ship was launched nearly a year later on 20 March 1909. In May 1910, Von der Tann sailed from the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg to receive her final fitting-out in the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) at Kiel. The German Navy was chronically short of crews at the time, so dockyard workers had to bring the ship to Kiel. On 1 September 1910, the ship was commissioned into the German Navy, with a crew composed largely of men from the dreadnought . During sea trials, she reached an average speed of 27 kn (50 km/h) over a six-hour period, with a top speed of 28.124 kn (52.086 km/h) with the engines at maximum output. Von der Tann was sent to South America after completing her trials, departing Germany on 20 February 1911. She stopped in the Canary Islands on the way. She visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, arriving there on 14 March before continuing on to Itajaha on 23 March. From there, she continued to Bahía Blanca, Argentina on 27 March, remaining there until 8 April when she left for Bahia, Brazil, which she reached six days later. On 17 April, she departed for home, arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 6 May. The primary purpose of the cruise was to obtain armament contracts from South American countries by impressing them with what was \\"widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat.\\" Two days after arriving in port, Von der Tann joined I Scouting Group, and in June, she attended the Fleet Review at Spithead for the coronation of King George V of the United Kingdom. In late September, she became the flagship of I Scouting Group, replacing Blücher in that role. In July 1912, the new battlecruiser replaced Von der Tann as flagship. = First World War = alt=A large, burning warship rolling over and sinking; a smaller, black ship is nearby with two small boats. 1914 At the outbreak of the First World War, Von der Tann was serving as the flagship of the 3rd Admiral of Reconnaissance Forces, Konteradmiral Tapken. The ship was assigned to I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper. Von der Tanns first major sortie during the war occurred when the ship took part in the unsuccessful search for British battlecruisers, after the Battle of Heligoland Bight, in August 1914. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight, Von der Tann had been stationed in Wilhelmshaven Roads, and had been ordered to raise steam as early as 08:20, to assist the German cruisers under attack in the Heligoland Bight. At 08:50, Rear Admiral Hipper requested permission from Admiral von Ingenohl, the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, to send Von der Tann and Moltke to relieve the beleaguered German cruisers. Von der Tann was ready to sail by 10:15, more than an hour before the British battlecruisers arrived on the scene. However, the ship was held up by low tide, which prevented the battlecruisers from crossing the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. At 14:10, Von der Tann and Moltke were able to cross the Jade bar, and Hipper ordered the German light cruisers to fall back on the two heavy ships, while Hipper himself was about an hour behind in the battlecruiser Seydlitz. At 14:25, the remaining light cruisers, , , , , and , rendezvoused with the battlecruisers. Seydlitz arrived on the scene by 15:10; Ariadne succumbed to battle damage and sank. Hipper ventured forth cautiously to search for the two missing light cruisers, and . By 16:00, the German flotilla began returning to the Jade Estuary, arriving at approximately 20:23. Later that year Von der Tann was present at the Raid on Yarmouth, on 2–3 November. At 16:30 on the 2nd, Von der Tann, along with Seydlitz (Hipper's flagship), Moltke, the armored cruiser Blücher, and the four light cruisers Strassburg, , , and Stralsund, departed the Jade Estuary, bound for the English coast with the intent to lay minefields in British sea lanes. At 18:00, two dreadnought battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet departed to provide support. Hipper's force veered north in an arc to avoid Heligoland and the British submarines stationed there, and then increased speed to 18 knots. At approximately 06:30 the following morning, Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British minesweeper and opened fire, which drew the attention of the destroyer . Hipper realized that he was wasting time, and that further pursuit would run his ships into a known minefield, so he ordered his ships back to sea. As the flotilla was turning away, the battlecruisers fired several salvos at Great Yarmouth, to little effect. By the time the British Admiralty was fully aware of the situation, the German force had retreated back to home waters. alt=Map showing the locations of the British and German fleets; the German light cruisers pass between the British battleship and battlecruiser forces while the German battlecruisers steam to the northeast. The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships. Von der Tann also participated in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, on 15–16 December. The raid was another attempt to lure out a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet standing by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth I Scouting Group at anything less than full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th. During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Upon nearing the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. The two ships destroyed the coast guard stations in both towns, along with the signalling station in Whitby. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and began to retreat eastward. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's withdrawal, and following the bombardment of the target cities, turned back to rendezvous with the German fleet. By this time, David Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund, and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however, those were some 50 km (31 mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape. 1915–1916 Illustration of Von der Tann underway Von der Tann was being refitted at the time of the Battle of Dogger Bank, and so she missed this action. She was replaced by the armored cruiser Blücher, which was sunk during the battle. A detachment of men from Von der Tann had been sent to Blücher and went down with the ship. In 1915 the ship took part in operations in the North and Baltic Seas. On 10 August 1915, Von der Tann shelled the island fortress at Utö, in the eastern Baltic, during which she took part in an artillery duel with the Russian armored cruiser . Von der Tann also engaged the Russian armored cruiser and five destroyers, during which Von der Tann was struck by a shell through the funnel, which caused no casualties. On 3–4 February 1916, Von der Tann participated in the fleet advance to welcome home the commerce raider . The ship was also present during the fleet sorties of 5–7 March, 17 April, 21–22 April, and 5 May. Von der Tann also took part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker. The German battlecruisers Derfflinger, Lützow, Moltke, Seydlitz and Von der Tann left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Boedicker's ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50. By 14:00, Boedicker's ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, Seydlitz struck a mine, which tore a 50-ft (15-m) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, which allowed 1,400-t (1,500-short tons) of water to enter the ship. Seydlitz turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of 15 knots. The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, Seydlitz was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat brought Boedicker to Lützow. The German battlecruisers bombarding Lowestoft At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers and , which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Admiral Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force. Boedicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. The two 6 in (15 cm) shore batteries were destroyed, along with other damage to the town. KzS Zenker, Von der Tanns commanding officer, later wrote: At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one salvo each, with the exception of Derfflinger, which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47, encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the screening force. Boedicker's ships opened fire from a range of 13,000 yd (12,000 m). Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, Boedicker broke off the chase, and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany.  Battle of Jutland  alt=A large ship is sinking in the distance; a large dense cloud of smoke emanates from the wreck. Von der Tann participated in the Battle of Jutland, as part of Hipper's First Scouting Group. Von der Tann was the rearmost of five battlecruisers in Hipper's line. Shortly before 16:00 CET, on 31 May 1916, Hipper's force encountered Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yd (14,000 m). At 16:49, Von der Tann fired her first shot at . Fourteen minutes of firing later, Von der Tann had scored five hits on Indefatigable out of 52 heavy shells fired, one of which caused Indefatigable to explode and sink. An observer on the battlecruiser , which was directly ahead of Indefatigable, later remarked that he saw \\"the Indefatigable hit by two shells from the Von der Tann, one on the fore turret. Both appeared to explode on impact. After an interval of thirty seconds, the ship blew up. Sheets of flame were followed by dense smoke which obscured her from view.\\" Following the destruction of Indefatigable, Beatty turned his force away, while the British 5th Battle Squadron closed in on the German battlecruisers, opening fire from approximately 19,000 yd (17,000 m). Von der Tann and Moltke, the two rearmost of Hipper's squadron, came under fire from the three lead British battleships of the 5th BS: , , and . The German battlecruisers began zig-zagging to avoid the gunfire from the British ships. At 17:09, six minutes after sinking Indefatigable, Von der Tann was hit by one 15 in (38 cm) shell from Barham, which struck beneath the waterline and dislodged a section of the belt armor, causing Von der Tann to take in 600 tons of water. This hit temporarily damaged the ship's steering gear, and combined with Von der Tanns zig-zagging cause her to fall out of line to port. The German Official History commented that \\"the greatest calamity of a complete breakdown of the steering gear was averted, otherwise, Von der Tann would have been delivered into the hands of the oncoming battleships as in the case of Blücher during the Dogger Bank action.\\" Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May – 1 June 1916 At 17:20, a 13.5 in (34 cm) shell from the battlecruiser struck the barbette of Von der Tanns A turret. A chunk of armor plate was dislodged from inside the turret, and struck the turret training gear, which jammed the turret at 120 degrees. This put the turret out of action for the duration of the engagement. At 17:23, the ship was hit again by a 13.5 in (34 cm) shell from Tiger, which struck near the C turret and killed 6 men. The shell holed the deck and created enough wreckage that the turret was unable to traverse, and the starboard rudder engine room was damaged. The C turret was out of action until the wreckage could be cut away. Smoke from a fire caused by burning practice targets that had been stowed below the turret obscured the ship. Sections of the torpedo nets were knocked loose and trailed behind the ship. However, they were cut loose before they could catch in the propellers. New Zealand, which had been engaging Von der Tann following Indefatigables destruction, lost sight of her target and shifted fire to Moltke. At 17:18, the range to Von der Tann from Barham had closed to 17,500 yd (16,000 m), at which point Von der Tann opened fire on the British battleship. Shortly thereafter, at 17:23, Von der Tann registered a hit on Barham. However, after firing only 24 shells, Von der Tann had to return to her earlier target, New Zealand, because her fore and aft turrets had since been disabled, and her amidships turrets were no longer able to target Barham. At 18:15, the guns of the last active turret jammed in their mountings, leaving Von der Tann without any working main armament. Regardless, she remained in the battle line to distract the British gunners. Because she was no longer firing her main guns, Von der Tann was able to maneuver in an erratic manner, such that she could avoid British gunfire. By 18:53, the ship's speed fell from 26 kn (48 km/h) to 23 kn (43 km/h). Over an hour and a half after having failed due to mechanical difficulties, D turret was repaired and again ready for action. Von der Tann sustained her fourth and final heavy shell hit at 20:19, when one 15 in (38 cm) shell from struck the aft conning tower. Shell splinters penetrated the conning tower, killing the Third Gunnery Officer and both rangefinder operators and wounding every other crewman in the tower. Shell fragments and other debris fell through the ventilating shaft and onto the condenser, which put out all the lights in the ship. Eleven minutes later, at 20:30, B turret was again clear for action, and by 21:00, C turret was also in working order. However, both of the amidships turrets suffered further mechanical difficulties that put them out of action later during the battle. Von der Tann in her configuration at Jutland At approximately 22:15, Hipper, with his flag now in Moltke, ordered his battlecruisers to increase speed to 20 knots, and to fall into the rear of the main German line. Neither Derfflinger, due to battle damage, nor Von der Tann, due to the dirtiness of her boiler fires, could steam at more than 18 knots. Derfflinger and Von der Tann took up positions astern of the II Squadron, and were later joined by the old pre-dreadnoughts and at 00:05. At 03:37, the British destroyer Moresby fired a torpedo at the rear of the German line; this passed closely across Von der Tanns bow, and forced the ship to turn sharply to starboard to avoid being hit. Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Admiral Scheer, informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, Derfflinger and Von der Tann each had only two guns in operation, Moltke was flooded with 1,000 tons of water, and Seydlitz was severely damaged. Hipper reported: \\"I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbor by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet.\\" During the course of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets suffered mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11 hours, although three turrets were restored to working order before the end of the battle; D turret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.  Later actions  After Jutland, she underwent repairs from 2 June until 29 July. After returning to the fleet, Von der Tann took part in several unsuccessful raids into the North Sea in 1916. During the first of these, conducted on 18–19 August, Von der Tann was one of two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition (along with Moltke), so three dreadnoughts were assigned to I Scouting Group for the operation: , , and . I Scouting Group was to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland, in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind, providing cover. The British were aware of the German plans, and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Further sorties were conducted on 25–26 September, 18–19 October, 23–24 October, as well as the advance on 23–24 March 1917; none of these resulted in action with British forces. Von der Tann served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter during the fleet advance to Norway on 23–25 April 1918, as well as in the sortie on 8–9 July. = Fate = alt=A line of large warships. Thick black smoke pours from their funnels as they steam through choppy seas. Von der Tann was to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the Grand Admiral (Grossadmiral) of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. While the High Seas Fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, sailors began deserting en masse. As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's inner harbor and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under Reuter's command, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men. Von der Tann was interned at Scapa Flow under the command of Kapitän-Leutnant Wollante. While in Scapa Flow, a soldiers' council was formed aboard the ship; the council took complete, dictatorial control of the vessel for the duration of the interment. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy- acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; by the time the men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.

Some erotic hypnosis is practiced in the context of BDSM relationships and communities. In addition, for some people hypnosis is inherently erotic, making it an example of a sexual fetish or paraphilia. Practice Erotic hypnosis can involve hypnotic suggestions intended to increase arousal, to create or enhance sexual pleasure \\\\- in some cases involving \\"hands-free orgasms\\" \\\\- to produce new sensations, to freeze partners in place or simulate bondage, or to enhance roleplay, with popular types of hypnotic roleplay including animal transformations, robot play and doll play. Erotic hypnosis may be done face- to-face, over video conferencing or text chat, or through pre-recorded audio files or videos. Sessions may involve suggestions that are to take effect during trance or afterwards, in the form of post-hypnotic suggestions, some of which might be triggered by an action or situation. Relation to BDSM Hypnosis is an increasingly popular practice within a dominance and submission relationship to reinforce power exchange and as a form of play. Some people report that being hypnotized produces a strong feeling of giving up control, for example the feeling that they must obey the hypnotist's commands. Several practitioners have compared the sensation of trance to subspace. Major BDSM events in North America now frequently contain classes and workshops dedicated to erotic hypnosis, such as events run by Black Rose and TES. In addition to a presence at these general BDSM events, since 2009 national-level erotic hypnosis conventions have been held in cities in North America and worldwide, as well as local meetups such as munches. Hypnosis fetishism and mind control fetishism A subset of those interested in erotic hypnosis find hypnosis inherently erotic, therefore making it an example of a sexual fetish. They may be aroused by hypnotizing others, by the feeling of being hypnotized, or by seeing people being hypnotized. Hypnosis fetishism has been recorded in the clinical literature as far back as 1957, when George Merrill noted that \\"to many hypnotic subjects, hypnosis has strong sexual connotations\\". In one case study of a patient who eroticized hypnosis, he wrote > Her enthusiasm for hypnosis, her obvious enjoyment of the trance, and her > relaxed, happy, 'starry-eyed' appearance after awakening from each trance > suggested that she was deriving more gratification from the hypnotic > experience than would be likely just from the relief of symptoms and the > gaining of insight. Hypnosis fetishism has a large overlap with mind control fetishism, which in addition to typically unrealistic, fantasy depictions of hypnotic control, may include magic (telepathy, vampires) or fictional technology (brainwashing machines, robotization) as plot devices. Hypnosis and mind control fetish content has been shared on the internet since its early years, as in a 1997 survey of stories from alt.sex.stories which found that \\"five percent of stories involved some kind of mind control (such as hypnosis, the use of mythical mind control machines or drugs)\\".

It takes place in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), in southern Africa, during the 1940s and deals with the racial politics between whites and blacks in that country (which was then a British Colony). The novel created a sensation when it was first published and became an instant success in Europe and the United States. The novel begins with a newspaper clipping about the death of Mary Turner, a white woman, killed by her black servant, Moses. The bulk of the novel is the story of Mary's life. After a loveless, wretched childhood, Mary is contented with her life as an office worker in a city in Rhodesia. But, after overhearing her friends laugh at her as sexless and immature, she resolves to marry, and when Dick Turner asks her she consents, though she has met him only twice. Dick is also in a hurry to wed, because he is very lonely and unhappy clawing a bare living from a subsistence farm and living in a bare, ugly little house. From the beginning, they are distant and cold, but, except when Mary briefly runs away, fear of loneliness and lack of money keep them together. When Mary becomes involved in the running of the farm, she realizes that its failure is not down to bad luck, as Dick keeps telling her, but his incompetence. This distances her even more from him. Their white neighbors make overtures of friendship, but, out of shame at her poverty, Mary rejects them. The Turners' barren existence is contrasted with the fierce beauty of the land, to which they are oblivious. The natives, whom Dick employs on the farm, are a further source of tension. Black people have never been part of Mary's world, and she treats them with frigid contempt. They have difficulty keeping a servant until Dick assigns his best field hand, Moses, to the house. What he does not know is that the weal on Moses' face is there because Mary, enraged at what she considered insolence, struck him with a whip. As the farm deteriorates, the three of them are locked into an elaborate dance of intimacy, despair, and, finally, death. Title, dedication, and introductory quotations The title is a phrase from the fifteen lines of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land quoted after the novel's dedication to a Mrs Gladys Maasdorp \\"of Southern Rhodesia, for whom I feel the greatest affection and admiration.\\" Found on both lines 354 and 386 of Part V: 'What the Thunder Said', it is one of the more jubilant and reviving images used in that section, despite its theme of destruction's power over growth. Lessing also quotes an anonymous author: \\"It is by the failures and misfits of a civilization that one can best judge its weaknesses.\\" Adaptations The book was adapted into a movie in 1981 by a Swedish company. Filmed in Zambia, the film stars John Thaw, Karen Black and John Kani in the lead roles. It is also known under the titles Gräset sjunger (Swedish) and Killing Heat.

History Murzuk developed around an oasis which served as a stop on the north-south trade route across the Sahara Desert. From the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, Marzuk was home to the Garamantian Empire, a city state which operated the Trans-Saharan trade routes between the Carthaginians—and later the Roman Empire—and the Sahelian states of West and Central Africa. By 1300, the area was ruled by the Kanem Empire. According to Helmuth Kanter, a Moroccan tribe overran the area in 1310 and established Murzuk as the capital of their sultanate. The fortress, now in ruins, was built around this time. By 1400 the city was ruled by the Bornu Empire, and the legacy of Kanem-Bornu sovereignty is still evident, as some streets have names in the Kanembu and Kanuri languages. In the later half of the 15th century, the area became a tributary of the Hafsid dynasty in Tunis. Murzuk in 1821 Early in the 16th century, Muhammad al-Fasi established the Awlad Muhammad dynasty of Murzuq, which would hold power in the city until 1812. Al-Fasi is traditionally held to be a Moroccan sharif, but according to John Ralph Willis, oral tradition indicates that he was a pilgrim from Saguia el-Hamra in present-day Western Sahara. According to this tradition, he was the leader of a caravan who, on arriving at the fortress of Murzuk, was asked to take control of the city by local Fezzani rulers. The reason suggested for this is an intensification of Tuareg or Berber raids, or that he was attracted by slave trade. According to tradition, he built a castle in Murzuk, which has been identified possibly as the ruined \\"Qal'at Awlad Muhammad\\". The establishment of his dynasty reinvigorated pilgrim traffic and the slave trade, and soon, Murzuk became an important part of a slaving network which extended into present-day Chad and Central African Republic. By the late 16th century it had gained more importance than Ghat and Ghadames. Under Ottoman rule (1578–1912) Murzuk was at times the capital of Fezzan, and enjoyed a long period of prosperity. The town had a major fort, and was termed the \\"Paris of the Sahara\\".The term \\"Paris of the Sahara\\" is more usually applied to Marrakesh. The Ottoman army usually maintained a garrison there,Abun-Nasr, Jamil M. (1987) A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, p. 315, but local control remained in the hands of the Sultan of Fezzan.Hornemann, Friedrich (1802) The journal of Frederick Horneman's travels from Cairo to Mourzouk: the capital of the kingdom of Fezzan in Africa in the years 1797-8 Darf, London, ; republished under various titles including Missions to the Niger In the early nineteenth century, Murzuk served as the jumping off point for multiple British expeditions in search of Lake Chad and the legendary Timbuktu. The 1822 Denham, Oudney and Clapperton expedition traveled from Tripoli to Murzuk, where they attempted to obtain protection and supplies for their journey south. The town was considered unhealthy by many British explorers and led to illness for many, killing some and forcing others back to Tripoli. According to James Richardson: \\"Feb 26th (1846). I must now consider myself recovered from indisposition. At first, people talked so much about Mourzuk fever that I thought I must have it as a matter of course ... Three-fourths of the Europeans who come here invariably have the fever. I speak of the Turks. It attacks them principally in the beginning of the hot, and cold, weather, or in May and November. ... Mourzuk is emphatically called, like many places of Africa, Blad Elhemah, country of fever.\\" The town declined in importance as modern transportation replaced traditional trade routes in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The Ottomans ceded Fezzan, along with the rest of their Libyan territories, to the Italians in 1912, following the Italo-Turkish War. Murzuk became part of colonial Italian Libya, although the town was not actually occupied by the Italians until 1914. On 11 January 1941, during the Second World War, Murzuk and its small Italian airbase were the target of a raid by about 70 men of the British Long Range Desert Group and a handful of Free French soldiers from Chad. A small Italian garrison holed up in the old Ottoman fort eventually surrendered to the attackers, and the planes and facilities at the nearby airbase were destroyed. The British and Free French then withdrew, setting the garrison free, as they didn't have the transport or rations to carry the prisoners back to allied lines.Lloyd-Owen, David: The Long Range Desert Group 1940–1945: Providence Their Guide; Pen and Sword, 2009 In 1960 Murzuk had a population of 7,000 residents. =Libyan civil war= During the Libyan Civil War, Toubou tribal fighters reportedly captured Murzuk on 17 August 2011.Staff (20 August 2011). \\"Libya: Toubou Rebels Engage in Battle Against Gaddafi\\" . Ennahar Online. Retrieved 22 August 2011. On 22 February 2019 it was reported by the Benghazi General Command that Murzuk had been captured by forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar. On 4 August 2020, an airstrike by the Libyan National Army against a wedding in Murzuk killed 43 people and injured 60.  Climate  Murzuk has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) typical of the Fezzan, a Libyan region lying on the heart of the Sahara Desert. Averages high temperatures exceed 40 °C (104 °F) during summer for 3 months (June, July, August) and averages high temperatures remain above 19 °C (66.2 °F) during the coldest month of the year. Winter days are very warm, sunny and dry. Annual precipitation averages only 7 mm (0.32 in) making the location one of the driest places on Earth. The sky is always clear and bright throughout the year.  Culture  In 2013, the first Toubou national festival in Libya was held in Murzuk. The city also has an annual cultural festival, which was postponed in 2014 due to security concerns. In 2013, two new cultural centers were opened in the town and six more were reported to be close to completion. In 2003, the municipality of Murzuk had 68 educational institutions, 1277 classrooms and 3009 teachers.

Named after the German province of Silesia, Schlesien was laid down at the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig on 19 November 1904, launched on 28 May 1906, and commissioned on 5 May 1908. She was armed with a battery of four guns and had a top speed of . The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service, as they were inferior in size, armor, firepower, and speed to the revolutionary new British battleship . After commissioning, Schlesien was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, later being transferred to II Battle Squadron. She was primarily occupied with training cruises and fleet maneuvers in her early career. She served with the fleet throughout the first two years of World War I, seeing action at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where she was briefly actively engaged in combat. After Jutland, the Imperial Navy relegated Schlesien to guard duties before withdrawing her altogether in 1917, when she became a training ship. The Treaty of Versailles permitted the German navy to keep eight obsolete battleships, including Schlesien, to defend the German coast. Initially kept in reserve, she was modernized in the mid-1920s and saw extensive service with the reorganized Reichsmarine. Schlesien saw limited combat during World War II, briefly bombarding Polish forces during the invasion of Poland in September 1939. She escorted minesweepers during Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark in April 1940. After the operation, she was given secondary duties, primarily serving as a training ship and icebreaker. She ended her career providing fire support in the Baltic coast. While off Swinemünde on 3 May 1945, she struck a mine and was towed into Swinemünde, where she was sunk by her crew in shallow water, though much of her superstructure, including her main battery, remained above water. In the remaining days of the war, Schlesien used her anti-aircraft guns to defend the city from air attack. After the end of the war, she was broken up, though some parts of the ship remained visible until the 1970s.  Design  alt=Side and top views of a large ship; shaded areas show the full-length belt of side armor. Two large gun turrets, also heavily armored, are placed on either end of the ship, which is fitted with two tall masts and three funnels. In 1900, the Second Naval Law passed under the direction of Vizeadmiral (VAdmVice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz. The law secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s. Shortly thereafter, design work began on a follow-up design, which became the . The Deutschland-class ships were broadly similar to the Braunschweigs, but featured incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the gun turrets for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional casemates to save weight. The British battleship armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) gunswas commissioned in December 1906. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including Schlesien. Schlesien was long, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced , and had a full-load displacement of . She was equipped with three triple expansion engines and twelve coal-fired water-tube boilers that produced a rated and a top speed of . In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, Schlesien was the most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for . She had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship's primary armament consisted of four 28 cm SK L/40 guns in two twin turrets; one turret was placed forward and the other aft. She was also equipped with fourteen SK L/40 guns mounted in casemates and twenty guns in casemates. The ship was fitted with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the broadside. Her armored belt was thick amidships and she had a armored deck. The main battery turrets had sides.  Service history  The contracts for the last two members of the Deutschland class, ordered under the contract names \\"R\\" and \\"Q\\", were awarded on 11 June 1904. \\"R\\" was laid down on 19 November at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig. She was launched on 28 May 1906, at which time Duchess Mathilde of Pless christened her Schlesien, after the province of Silesia. Graf von Zedlitz Trützschler, the Oberpräsident of Silesia, gave a speech at the launching ceremony. A shipyard crew took the ship from Danzig to Kiel in March 1908 for her final fitting- out. Schlesien was commissioned into the fleet on 5 May. She then began sea trials, which were delayed from 6 July to 5 September when the ship was temporarily used as a torpedo testing ship in place of the protected cruiser , which had to go into drydock for an overhaul. By early September, Vineta had completed her overhaul, allowing Schlesien to join the fleet. She received her full crew on 22 September and thereafter joined I Battle Squadron. The ships of the High Seas Fleet embarked on a cruise into the Atlantic Ocean that lasted from 7 July to 1 August. While on the way back to Germany, they were received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. In late 1909, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the new fleet commander. His tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, due to the threat the latest underwater weapons posed, and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910. In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in Danzig on 29 August. A training cruise into the Baltic Sea took place at the end of the year. In March 1911, the fleet conducted exercises in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. Schlesien and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat, during which another fleet review was held in order to prepare for an Austro-Hungarian delegation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. On 3 November 1911, Schlesien was transferred to II Battle Squadron with the rest of her sister ships; at this time, she transferred back to Kiel, where II Squadron was based. In mid-1912, due to the Agadir Crisis, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. The fleet thereafter held the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. A winter cruise in the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In 1913 the same uneventful pattern followed. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. The threat of war during the July Crisis forced Kaiser Wilhelm II to end the cruise after only two weeks; by the end of July the fleet was back in port. = World War I = Schlesien served with the High Seas Fleet through the first two years of the war. At the outbreak of the conflict, the ship was deployed to guard the German Bight. She then rejoined the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers that bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914. During the operation, the German battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet, and so he broke off the engagement and went back home. Two fruitless fleet advances followed on 17–18 and 21–23 April 1915. Another followed on 17–18 May, and another on 23–24 October. In March 1916, Schlesien was employed as a target ship for U-boats. On 24–25 April, Schlesien and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group on a raid of the English coast. While en route to the target, the battlecruiser was damaged by a mine. The remaining battlecruisers conducted a short bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The target's visibility was poor, so the operation was soon called off before the British fleet could intervene. Squadron exercises in the Baltic followed from 11 to 22 May.  Battle of Jutland  alt=The German fleet sailed to the north and met the British fleet sailing from the west; both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during the chaotic battle. Admiral Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to Seydlitz delayed the operation until the end of May. Schlesien was the second ship in IV Division of II Battle Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral , positioned at the rear of the German line. During the ensuing operation, Schlesien was the second to last ship in the German line, followed only by her sister ship . During the \\"Run to the North,\\" Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the commander of the fleet, ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower Deutschland-class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with a large numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower Deutschland-class ships; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape. Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As they had fallen behind, the ships of IIBattle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Schlesien and the other five ships of the squadron were, therefore, located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of IIIBattle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line. Later on the first day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Schlesien and the other so-called \\"five-minute ships\\" came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Schlesien and her sisters could barely make out a target in the darkness. Owing to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships; in the brief melee a near miss from a large-caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto Schlesiens decks, killing one man and wounding another. Admiral Mauve ordered an 8-point turn to the south, and the British did not follow. Late on the 31st, the fleet organized for the night return to Germany; Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein fell in behind the mauled battlecruisers and at the rear of the line. British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which targeted Schlesien. Regardless, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the Nassau and es took up defensive positions. Later wartime service After Jutland, Schlesien and her three surviving sisters returned to picket duty at the mouth of the Elbe, and in June and July Schlesien again served as a torpedo target ship for U-boats. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. From 31 January to 9 February 1917, she served in the Danish straits as a guard ship, and also as an icebreaker, after which she returned to the Elbe. From 2 May to 8 June, she was again used as a target ship in the Baltic. Her guard ship duties in the Elbe ended on 27 July, when she was withdrawn from service and converted into a training ship for engine room personnel and new recruits. She served in this capacity from 20 August to 16 April 1918. In late April, Schlesien was taken into the drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven to be converted into a training ship for naval cadets. The ship's main and secondary battery guns were removed so they could be used ashore, leaving Schlesien equipped with a battery of and guns. She had made several training cruises in the Baltic by November 1918; she was in Kiel during the Kiel mutiny in the closing days of the war. On 5 November, she left the port still flying the Imperial German flag even after most of the other vessels in the port had hoisted the red flag of revolution. Schlesien initially went to Flensburg, but mutiny had already spread to the port, so on orders from the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Naval Office) she sailed instead to Swinemünde, where on 10 November her commander, Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) von Waldeye-Hartz hauled down his flag and placed his ship out of service. He and the crew remained aboard, and on 14 November they took the ship back to Kiel, where they were released from service on 20 November. She was used briefly again to train cadets to operate boilers and engines; on 1 December, she was again removed from service. = Inter-war years = alt=Overhead view of a large ship, much of which is covered with canvas sun shades, as it passes through calm waters. Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the Reichsmarine according to the Treaty of Versailles. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre- dreadnought battleships under Article 181—two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. Schlesien was one of the vessels retained under the terms of the treaty, but was initially kept in reserve, since she still carried the battery of just 10.5 cm and 8.8 cm guns. By the mid-1920s, two of the battleships still in active service, and , were becoming worn out and needed replacement. The replacements for the old battleships—the s—would not be ready for some time, and so the navy decided to rearm and modernize Schlesien in 1926–1927. Her original 28 cm guns were reinstalled, and a new secondary battery of guns were installed in the casemates for the old 17 cm guns. This included removing the fore funnel and ducting those boilers into an enlarged funnel, and installing a new heavy pole mast. The work was completed on 1 March 1927, and she thereafter entered service with the crew from Hannover. On joining the rest of the fleet, Schlesien became the flagship of the Commander of the Naval Forces of the North Sea, Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Alexander Werth, which was renamed on 1 January 1930 the Commander of Battleships. She was based in Wilhelmshaven. In May 1927, President Paul von Hindenburg came to Wilhelmshaven to visit the fleet. The annual fleet maneuvers were conducted in August and September, as they had been in the prewar years, and they culminated in a naval review on 14 September for Hindenburg. KAdm Wilhelm Prentzel replaced Werth on 29 September and in October 1928 he was in turn replaced by KAdm Walther Franz. In the course of 1928, Schlesien went on a fleet cruise in the Atlantic in July and conducted shooting training in August with the old ironclad, now target ship, . Another Atlantic cruise followed in April and May 1929. In February 1930, Franz, who had by then been promoted to the rank of vizeadmiral, turned command of the unit to KAdm Richard Foerster. From 3 April to 6 June, Schlesien embarked on a major training cruise by herself to the Mediterranean Sea, during which she visited Messina, Sicily, where her senior officers met King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. In June 1931, Schlesien visited Norway. Kommodore (Commodore) Max Bastian replaced Foerster in September 1932, and at the same time, Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Wilhelm Canaris, who later served as chief of the Abwehr, took command of the ship, a position he would hold for the next two years. Schlesien made another trip into the Atlantic in January 1933, which included a stop in Iceland from 6 to 9 January. On 10 December 1933, the new heavy cruiser replaced Schlesien as the flagship of the Commander of Battleships. Schlesien was converted back into a training ship for cadets between 18 February and 8 April 1935, and she was formally removed from the fleet organization on 30 September. Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns and replacement of the ship's boilers. The newer boilers were more efficient, which allowed fewer of them to be used; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and an instruction room. The crew was also altered; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men; after the conversion, this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors, supplemented by 214 cadets. Over the course of the following three years, Schlesien embarked on several overseas training cruises as part of the Training Inspectorate. The first lasted from 1 December 1935 to 29 February 1936, and went to Cape Verde in the central Atlantic. More modernization work was done after her return to Germany, and from 12 October 1936 to 22 April 1937, she went on a tour of North, Central, and South America. Further cruises followed in October 1937, April 1938, and March 1939. During this period, her last coal-fired boilers were replaced with oil-fired models. = World War II = Schlesien fires at Hel Fortified Area. Schlesien (background) and Schleswig-Holstein (right side-foreground) in alt=Two large ships bristling with guns moored close to shore. After the outbreak of World War II following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Schlesien initially remained in her training ship role, though from 21 to 27 September she was used to bombard Polish artillery positions around Hel and Jastarnia. After the operation, Schlesien had six of her 15 cm guns removed to arm the new surface raider . She then returned to training ship duties, and from January to March 1940 served as an icebreaker to allow U-boats to operate. She then escorted minesweepers in the Little Belt in April during Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark. She resumed training duties, but crew shortages forced the navy to deactivate the ship on 2 August, leaving only a skeleton crew aboard to maintain the ship's condition. In January 1941, she was reactivated to again serve as an icebreaker in the Baltic until 31 March, when she was again decommissioned in Gotenhafen, thereafter being used as a stationary training hulk with a skeleton crew. As Germany began to prepare for war with the Soviet Union in early 1941, Schlesien was reactivated on 30 April to protect minelayers along with Schleswig-Holstein as they laid a series of minefields in the Baltic to prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from attempting to break out to Britain. The Soviet fleet did not attempt to leave port after Germany invaded in June, and so Schlesien was detached from the force guarding the minefields in October. She returned to Gotenhafen and resumed training duties there. Icebreaker service again summoned the vessel to active service from January to April 1942. On 4 April, Schlesien sailed to back Gotenhafen in company with the battleship and the icebreaker . Schlesien thereafter saw limited training duties in the Baltic in 1943 and 1944, owing to the increasingly limited supplies of fuel oil available to Germany by this stage in the war. During this period, her armament was revised several times. In 1943, a pair of twin anti-aircraft guns were installed, one on each side of her bridge. In early 1944, her anti-aircraft armament was strengthened considerably with the addition of two 40 mm guns and twenty guns; these were in two Flakvierling quadruple, and six twin mounts. Further enhancements were made later in the year, including with the installation of four heavy 10.5 cm anti-aircraft guns in place of the old 8.8 cm guns atop her after superstructure and two more of the guns abreast her bridge, these taking the place of the 37 mm guns, which were removed. The light anti-aircraft battery increased to seven or ten 40 mm guns in single and double mounts and eighteen or twenty-two 20 mm guns in double and quadruple mounts (sources differ on the exact number of guns). Schlesien was also equipped with a FuMO-25 search radar and a FuMB-6 radar detection set, both of which were installed on the foremast. She was moved from Danzig to Gotenhafen and then to Sopot from 15 to 21 March 1945 to provide gunfire support to German forces in the area. She was then used to carry more than 1,000 wounded soldiers from Sopot to Swinemünde, where she also restocked her ammunition. She then remained in the port to shell the advancing Soviet 2nd Shock Army. On 2 May, she was ordered to protect the bridge that connected Wolgast and the island of Usedom. Early on the morning of 3 May, while steaming south of Greifswalder Oie, she struck a British air- dropped naval mine; the explosion killed two men and caused significant flooding. She was taken under tow by the destroyer back to Swinemünde, where her anti-aircraft guns could be used to help defend the city. The crew scuttled the ship there in shallow water so she could not be sunk by air attack and risk capsizing. Between 1949 and 1956, the wreck was demolished and then scrapped in situ by an East German company. Some remains from the ship were still visible in 1970.

History  The company's first publication was The Model Railroader, which began publication in the summer of 1933 with a cover date of January 1934. A press release announcing the magazine appeared in August 1933, but did not receive much interest. In 1940, business was good enough for Kalmbach to launch another magazine about railroads in general with the simple title of Trains Magazine. From its first issue dated November 1940, it grew quickly from an initial circulation of just over 5,000. Kalmbach became exclusively a publisher when it discontinued its printing operations in 1973, opting to contract production from other printers. In 1985, Kalmbach purchased AstroMedia Corporation, adding its four magazines: Astronomy, Deep Sky, the children's science magazine Odyssey and Telescope Making. Kalmbach began publishing its annual Great Model Railroads in November 1990. In 1991, Kalmbach purchased Greenberg Publishing of Sykesville, Maryland. Also included in the purchase was Greenberg Shows, which sponsored nearly two dozen combined model railroad and doll house shows on the East Coast. Intending to focus on the adult hobby and leisure market, Kalmbach sold the publication rights of the children's science magazine Odyssey to Cobblestone Publishing of Peterborough, New Hampshire in September 1991. In January 1992, Kalmbach began publishing Earth magazine. Kalmbach purchased Discover Media, publisher of the science magazine Discover, in August 2010. Gerald B. Boettcher, the company's president, retired in June 2012.Trains (Kalmbach Publishing). Vol. 70 (no. 1). January 2010. Charles R. Croft became the new president. In 2016 Kalmbach acquired Rather Dashing Games, a board game company based near Lexington, Kentucky. In 2018 the company sold the board game company to Loren and Heather Coleman, owners of game publisher Catalyst Game Labs. According to the Rather Dashing Games website, the company is now a division of Catalyst Game Labs. In 2017 the company hired digital media veteran Dan Hickey as its sixth chief executive officer. Hickey was the first Kalmbach leader hired from outside the company in its 84-year history. The company was renamed Kalmbach Media in 2018..

Originally Ikkō- shū was an \\"obscure band of Pure Land proponents\\" founded by Ikkō Shunjō in the fifteenth century. He was a disciple of Ryōchū of the Chinzei branch of Jōdo-shū Buddhism) and similar to Ippen's Ji-shū. However, when the religious and military-political establishment began to crack down on the Nembutsu, little distinction was made between the various factions. Most of Ikkō Shunjo's followers therefore defected to the more powerful Jōdo Shinshū and the name Ikkō-shū ultimately became synonymous with Jōdo Shinshū. Rennyo, the charismatic leader of the Hongan-ji branch of Jōdo Shinshū responded to this situation by clarifying the positive religious meaning of 'Ikkō' (single- minded) whilst simultaneously distancing himself from the antinomian behaviour of the original Ikkō sect. In his pastoral letters, known as Ofumi or Gobunsho, he therefore wrote; \\"It has been established with certainty that our Founder did not particularly name our school the \\"Ikkō-shū\\". On the whole, the reason the people call us this is that we place our complete reliance, exclusively, on Amida Buddha ...'However, the Founder has specifically named this sect \\"Jōdo Shinshū\\". Therefore, you must understand that we of our sect did not originate in any manner or form the name of \\"One-Mind Sect.\\" Ikkō- ikki revolts The Amida pietist movement, and in particular the Jōdo Shinshū, also provided a liberation theology (or ideology) for a wave of uprisings against the feudal system in late-fifteenth and sixteenth century Japan which are known as the Ikkō-ikki revolts. The causes of this phenomenon are disputed, but may have had both religious and socio-political causes. As a consequence of the Ikkō-ikki revolts and the growing power of the Jōdo Shinshū, the sect's fortress-temples Ishiyama Hongan-ji and Nagashima (built at the end of the 15th century) were eventually destroyed by Oda Nobunaga's armies. The fortress at Nagashima was razed to the ground in 1574, taking about 20,000 people with it. The Ishiyama Hongan-ji withstood the longest siege in Japanese history, before surrendering in 1580. Upon its ruins, Toyotomi Hideyoshi built Osaka Castle, a replica of which stands on the site today. Following the destruction of Nagashima, Nobunaga ordered his men to search all of Echizen Province and kill every last man and woman of the so- called Ikko sect. Other Ikkō-shū Buddhists went underground, forming the kakure nenbutsu. ReferencesFurther reading * Sansom, George Bailey. (1958). A History of Japan to 1334.

Colonia Juárez is located in the valley of the Piedras Verdes River on the western edge of the Chihuahuan Desert and beneath the eastern front of the Sierra Madre Occidental. It is roughly north of Mata Ortiz and southwest of Nuevo Casas Grandes. The town had a population of 1,035 in 2010. Established in 1886, the colony was named for the Mexican national hero Benito Juarez. The colony was one of many colonies in Mexico settled by Mormon pioneers, or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This colonization was part of the church's larger campaign to establish the State of Deseret while evading the anti-polygamy Edmunds Act of 1882. Although the town was planned before the end of polygamy, much of its growth in the late 19th century was due to Mormon immigrants leaving Utah and other parts of the U.S. due to their practice of polygamy. In addition, Mormon colonies outside of the U.S. proved financially important to the LDS Church during this time when the U.S. Federal government had confiscated much of the church's holdings. There are many descendants of these colonies that have attained prominence in both countries, including Mitt Romney. In addition, many church leaders have roots in these colonies. By the beginning of the 20th century, Chihuahua and other Mexican states were home to hundreds of thousands of Mormons and were almost a majority of the state of Sonora. The Mexican Revolution resulted in the exodus of many colonists from the region; some left permanently while others returned after a few years. Many families of all backgrounds sent women and children to the United States or Europe during the Revolution; others left completely. One of the last battles of the final phase of the Revolution was fought just outside Casas Grandes; several colonists participated in rescuing the wounded and caring for them at the old hacienda known in the histories as \\"El Refugio,\\" earning the gratitude of the Revolutionary Government. Many of the colonies survived for several generations after the Revolution. The mountain colonies, such as Pacheco, García, and Chuichupa, slowly lost colonist population due mainly to economic pressures, so that by the 1960s most Mormon colonists lived either in Colonia Juárez or Colonia Dublán, where to this day a sizable part of the population descend from the original colonists. Colonia Juárez is known for its peach and apple orchards as well as cattle ranches. It is also known for the many graduates from its renowned academy. Residents typically work as farmers, ranchers or in the local schools. Colonia Juárez is the home of the Academia Juárez (Juarez Stake Academy), a private high school owned by the LDS Church. Colonia Juárez is home to one of the LDS Church's temples. It was dedicated on March 6, 1999 by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. The Colonia Juárez Chihuahua México Temple was one of the first of the smaller, standardized temples the LDS Church began constructing in the late 1990s, and is currently the smallest temple it operates.

In the latter part of World War I, the Third OHL assumed dictatorial powers and became the de facto political authority in the empire. Formation and operation After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Prussian Army, Royal Saxon Army, Army of Württemberg and the Bavarian Army were autonomous in peacetime, each kingdom maintaining a separate war ministry and general staff to administer their forces. On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire made the German Emperor Commander-in-Chief of the combined armies (Oberster Kriegsherr, Supreme Warlord). The Emperor's role as Commander-in-Chief was largely ceremonial and authority lay with the Chief of the German General Staff, who issued orders in the Emperor's name. The pre-war Chief of the General Staff was Colonel General Helmuth von Moltke (The Younger) and the Oberste Heeresleitung was the command staff led by Moltke as Chief of the General Staff of the Army. The General Staff was initially formed into five divisions and two more were created during the war: * Central Division (Zentral-Abteilung) - Administered the General Staff's internal affairs. * Operations Division (Operationsabteilung) - The heart of the General Staff, responsible for planning and orders ** Operations Division B (Operationsabteilung B) - Oversaw the Macedonia and Turkish fronts. Split from the Operations Division on 15 August 1916. ** Operations Division II (Operationsabteilung II) - Previously the heavy artillery section of the Operations Division, merged with the Field Munitions Service on 23 September 1916. Responsible for the war economy. * Information Division (Nachrichtenabteilung) - Responsible for the analysis of military intelligence. Renamed the Foreign Armies Division on 20 May 1917. * Section IIIb - Responsible for espionage and counter espionage. * Political Division (Politische Abteilung) - responsible for legal questions and liaison with the political authorities. In addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consisted of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers. The Emperor was also Commander- in-Chief of the Imperial German Navy, which was led by the German Imperial Admiralty Staff and from August 1918 by the Seekriegsleitung (SKL, Naval Warfare Command). Co-ordination was poor at the beginning of the war between OHL and SKL, the navy did not even know about the Schlieffen Plan, an initial attack on France through Belgium. List of CommandersHistoryFirst OHL - Moltke= Upon mobilizing in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I, the Großer Generalstab (Great General Staff) formed the core of the Supreme Army Command, becoming the General Staff of the Field Army. Colonel General Helmuth von Moltke (The Younger), who had been Chief of the General Staff since 1906, continued in office, as did most of the Division heads. Partially as a result of these longstanding working relationships, Moltke delegated substantial authority to his subordinates, especially to the chiefs of the Operations Division, Colonel Gerhard Tappen, and the Information Division, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hentsch. These officers were often dispatched to subordinate headquarters to investigate and make decision on behalf of OHL. Although the German armies were victorious in the Battle of the Frontiers their advance was brought to a halt at First Battle of the Marne. Communications between OHL and the front line broke down and Hentsch was dispatched by Moltke to the Headquarters of the First and Second Armies to assess the situation. After discovering the Armies were separated from each other by a gap of twenty-five miles and in danger of being encircled, Hentsch ordered a retreat to the Aisne. On hearing the news from the front, Moltke suffered a nervous breakdown on 9 September. =Second OHL - Falkenhayn= Moltke was replaced by the Prussian Minister of War, Lieutenant General Erich von Falkenhayn, first informally in September and then officially on 25 October 1914. Although Tappen was retained as head of the Operations Division, Falkenhayn brought in two of his own associates, Generals Adolf Wild von Hohenborn and Hugo von Freytag-Loringhoven, into the OHL. Hohenborn served as Generalquartiermeister until January 1915 when he succeeded Falkenhayn as Prussian Minister of War. Freytag-Loringhoven replaced Hohenborn as Generalquartiermeister. Unlike his predecessor, Falkenhayn centralised decision making in his own hands and rarely explained himself to his subordinates; this characteristic has caused historians difficulty in assessing his actual intentions. After taking command Falkenhayn became engaged in the Race to the Sea as the German and Franco- British armies attempted to outflank each other to the north. The campaign culminated at Ypres where both combatants launched major offensives that failed to achieve a breakthrough. Two strategic issues dominated the remainder Falkenhayn's tenure as Chief of the General Staff. First was the priority accorded to the eastern and western fronts. Victories at the Battle of Tannenberg and First Battle of the Masurian Lakes had made Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg a popular hero and contrasted starkly with the stalemate in the west. Hindenburg and his supporters sought to shift Germany's main effort to the eastern front in hopes of knocking Russia out of the war. Falkenhayn resisted this, believing that France and Great Britain were the true opponents and that a decisive victory against the Russians was impossible. The second concern was the Battle of Verdun, the centrepeice of Falkenhayn's western strategy. Writing after the war, Falkenhayn stated that his intention was to draw the French Army into a battle of attrition and wear them down. However, as the battle developed casualties between the two armies were roughly equal. After the failure of Falkenhayn's strategy at Verdun and the entry into the war of the Kingdom of Romania on the Allied side in August 1916, he was replaced on 29 August by Hindenburg. =Third OHL - Hindenburg= Paul von Hindenburg's command became known as the Dritte OHL (Third OHL) but Hindenburg was \\"neither the intellectual centre of the strategic planning [...] nor of the new war economy\\", as proposed in the Hindenburg Programme of 31 August 1916. He was mostly a figurehead and a representative of the military command to the public. Control was mainly exercised by his deputy, General of Infantry Erich Ludendorff, who held the title Erster Generalquartiermeister (First Quartermaster General). The duumvirate increasingly dominated decision making on the German war effort, to an extent that they are sometimes described as de facto military dictators, supplanting the Emperor and Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, whom they managed to have replaced with Georg Michaelis in the summer of 1917. The OHL, through the Hindenburg Programme, a total war strategy, sought decisive victory. Ludendorff ordered the resumption of the unrestricted U-boat Campaign, which, along with the Zimmermann Telegram, provoked the United States to enter the war. The OHL ensured safe passage for Vladimir Lenin and his associates from Switzerland to Russia. After the October Revolution, the OHL negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to free troops for the 1918 Spring Offensive on the Western Front. As the tide of the war turned against Germany with the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, in late September 1918, Ludendorff called for the \\"parliamentisation\\" of the German government and immediate armistice negotiations. When he reversed course and demanded the fight to be resumed in October, Ludendorff was sacked and replaced by Lieutenant-General Wilhelm Groener. Hindenburg remained in office until his resignation from the armed forces in the summer of 1919. =Armistice and dissolution= As the German Revolution began, Hindenburg and Groener advised the Emperor to abdicate. Groener subsequently came to an agreement with the Social Democrat leader Friedrich Ebert known as the Ebert–Groener pact under which the Army leadership agreed to back the new republican government. With the war over in November 1918, the OHL was moved from Spa to Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel, to supervise the withdrawal of the German armies from the occupied territories. The final location of the OHL was at Kolberg after February 1919 as the military focus had shifted to preventing territorial encroachment by the Second Polish Republic. In July 1919, the Supreme Army Command and Great General Staff were disbanded by order of the Treaty of Versailles. For a few days, Groener had replaced Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff, after the latter resigned in late June. He resigned from his position as head of Kommandostelle Kolberg (as the staff had become on the formal dissolution of the OHL) in September 1919. =Locations= * Berlin, Germany (2–16 August 1914) * Koblenz, Germany (17–30 August 1914) * Luxembourg City, Luxembourg (30 August – 25 September 1914) * Charleville-Mézières, France (25 September 1914 – 19 September 1916) ** Advance Headquarters at Schloss Pless, Germany (9 May 1915 – 15 February 1916) ** Advance Headquarters at Schloss Pless, Germany (16 August – 20 September 1916) * Schloss Pless, Germany (20 September 1916 – 10 February 1917) * Bad Kreuznach, Germany (17 February 1917 – 7 March 1918) * Spa, Belgium (8 March – 13 November 1918) ** Advance Headquarters at Avesnes-sur-Helpe, France (18 March – 7 September 1918) * Schloss Wilhelmshöhe, Germany (14 November 1918 – 10 February 1919) NotesSee also * Oberkommando des Heeres, the army command within the combined Wehrmacht armed forces of Nazi Germany ReferencesBibliography * Further reading * External links * OHL Category:German Empire in World War I Category:German Army (German Empire) Category:National army headquarters ","title":"Oberste Heeresleitung"},{"id":"1628885","text":"Virginis may refer to : Astronomy *Stars in the constellation Virgo. **Alpha Virginis is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. **61 Virginis is a star located about 27.8 light-years away in the constellation of Virgo. **Etc. *101 Virginis or CY Boötis is a variable star in the Bootes constellation.

The present dollar has the ISO 4217 code BBD and is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign \\"$\\" or, alternatively, \\"Bds$\\" to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents. History The history of currency in the British colony of Barbados closely follows that of British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Britain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in- council of 1838 resulted in Barbados formally adopting the British sterling coinage in the year 1848. However, despite the circulation of British coins in Barbados the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them and the private sector continued to use dollar accounts for reckoning. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in Barbados in 1879. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. The first currency denominated in dollars to be issued in Barbados was in the form of private banknotes introduced in 1882. No subdivisions of the dollar were issued and these notes circulated alongside sterling, together with 1 pound notes issued by the government in 1917. From 1920, some of the private banknotes also carried a denomination in sterling, with 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Barbados became officially tied with those of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. Between 1938 and 1949, the Barbados government issued paper money denominated in dollars. The last private bank issues were made in 1949. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1965, the Eastern Caribbean dollar replaced the British West Indies dollar in Barbados. The present dollar was created after the establishment of the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), which was founded by an Act of parliament in May, 1972. The Barbados dollar replaced the East Caribbean dollar at par in 1973. Since 5 July 1975, the Barbados dollar has been pegged to the US dollar at US$1 = Bds$2. Most people in Barbados will accept USD at the fixed rate. Exchanging money at the airport yields however a lower rate (US$1 = Bds$1.98 + a service fee when buying Bds). For a wider outline of the history of currency in the region, see Currencies of the British West Indies. Coins In 1973, the first year of Barbados having its own coinage, coins were introduced in denominations of 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, and $1. From 1973 through 1991, the 1¢ was struck in bronze. From 1992, copper-plated zinc has been used. The 5¢ coin is struck in brass, whilst the highest 3 denominations are struck in cupronickel. The $1 coin is a 7-sided equilaterally-curved piece. A flying fish is adorned on one side, with the Barbadian coat of arms on the reverse. The Barbadian dollar coins are now minted in a plated-steel planchet first issued in 2007. Many of the coins in circulation have been struck at the Royal Canadian Mint. The reverse of the 5 cent coin depicts the South Point Lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse in Barbados. Banknotes In 1882, the Colonial Bank introduced notes for 5 dollars. In 1920, 20 and 100 dollar notes were also issued by this bank. In 1922, Barclays Bank, having taken over the Colonial Bank, began issuing 5, 20 and 100 dollar notes. The higher denominations ceased production in 1940 but the 5 dollar continued to be issued until 1949. The Royal Bank of Canada introduced notes in 1909, in denominations of 5, 20 and 100 dollars. From 1920, these notes also bore the denomination in sterling, with 5 dollars = 1 pound 10 pence, 20 dollars = 4 pounds 3 shillings 4 pence and 100 dollars = 20 pounds 16 shillings 8 pence. Notes were issued until 1938. The Canadian Bank of Commerce issued notes between 1922 and 1940, also in denominations of 5, 20 and 100 dollars. Between 1938 and 1949, the government issued notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 20 and 100 dollars. All bore the portrait of King George VI. On 3 December 1973, the Central Bank of Barbados introduced notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 dollars. The 1 dollar note was not issued again, with 2 dollar notes introduced in 1980, followed by 50 dollars in 1989. Banknotes currently in circulation are: *2 dollars (blue) *5 dollars (green) *10 dollars (brown) *20 dollars (purple) *50 dollars (orange) *100 dollars (grey) The defunct 1 dollar note was red in colour and had Samuel Jackman Prescod on the obverse. On 2 May 2013, the Central Bank of Barbados issued a new series of banknotes with a more modern design.

History The first human visitors to São Vicente appeared in the middle of the 15th century, colonizing the area much later than the settlers in the southern part of the island, owing to its fertility. This area of the island, due to its steep escarpments and deep river-valleys made early settlement difficult. The first settlers appeared in the areas of São Vicente and Ponta Delgada, respectively. The progressive growth of its population lead to dis-annexation of São Vicente from the Captaincy of Machico, and elevation to municipal seat by royal charter on 23 August 1774. At that time the parishes of Porto Moniz, Seixal, Arco de São Jorge and São Jorge where under the administration of the municipal authority. In 1835, the restructuring of municipal government under the Liberal reformer Mouzinho da Silveira lead to the creation of two new municipalities (Santana and Porto Moniz) along the northern coast of Madeira, which reduced the area of São Vicente.Boletim Municipal (April 2005), p.4 But, by 1867, under decree it reverted to its former dimensions. In 1898, with the re-establishment of the former municipalities São Vicente began to function within the current territorial area. =Legend= A legend exists that the toponymic name of the region, developed from an incident where Saint Vincent of Saragossa appeared in a rocky cove near the mouth of the river.

South Sudan: from revolution to independence. 2012. Columbia University Press. New York. p. 16. was a conflict from 1955 to 1972 between the northern part of Sudan and the southern Sudan region that demanded representation and more regional autonomy. Half a million people died over the 17 years and the war was divided into four major stages: initial guerrilla warfare, the creation of the Anyanya insurgency, political strife within the government and establishment of the South Sudan Liberation Movement. Although the peace agreement ended the First Sudanese Civil War's fighting in 1972, it failed to completely dispel the tensions and addressed only some of the issues stated by Southern Sudan. The breakdown of the initial appeasement later led to a reigniting of the north-south conflict during the Second Sudanese Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. The period between 1955 and 2005 is thus sometimes considered to be a single conflict with an eleven-year ceasefire that separated the two violent phases. Background Colonial Legacy = Until 1956, the British government, in collaboration with the Egyptian government (under a condominium governing arrangement) administered Southern Sudan and Northern Sudan as separate regions under international sovereignty. At the time, the two areas were merged into a single administrative region as part of the British strategy in the Middle East. This act was taken without consultation with minority southern leaders, who feared being subsumed by the political power of the larger north under the British colonial rule. Additionally, the British government exhibited favoritism by supporting multiple Northern cultural components that further deepened the societal divide between the two regions. After their liberation in 1956, the ethnic and domestic tensions against Southern Sudan further escalated during the post colonial reconstruction. There were national concerns of political inequalities, economic development and insufficient institutions that remained hidden to the international community but ravaged Sudan internally. Also, the northern government superseded the jurisdiction of Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) by committing discriminatory violence against the southern minorities under the guise of internal turmoil of democratic growth. = Perspectives = The North  Prior to the outbreak of the civil war, the elites of Northern Sudan had two unwavering interpretations of what led to its outbreak. Many attributed such hostilities to be the remnant of the South's colonial grievances against the British, while others viewed it to be the Southern insurgents' attempt in challenging their ruling government. Therefore, the traditional northern elites did not acknowledge the voiced resentment and rising insurgency to have been attributed to their own governance. On the contrary, the ruling class rigidly associated the conflict's persistence to be a rationalization of the South's integration of Christianity and modernity.  The South  Contrarily, the Southern populace viewed the emergence of the civil war to be an inevitability. Following the emancipation of the region of Sudan, the Southern elites were powerless within the realms of politics and the established government. The Southern politicians were incapable of addressing the injustice against their populace because of the minimal influence and support they had within the government in Khartoum. They were not only subjected to severe animosity as an ethnic minority but also as a religious minority within the state. Since their colonial subjection by the British, the Southern Sudanese were introduced and integrated to the principles of Western thought. Although there were no notable advancements such as political equality and industrialization within their region, they interpreted the concepts from Christianity and the Western ideals by merging them into their own culture. Therefore, in addition to their limited representation in politics, the coercion by the Northern government and the cultural restriction in achieving progress were critical factors towards to onslaught of the war. Course of the War Uprising = On 18 August 1955, members of the British-administered Sudan Defence Force Equatorial Corps mutinied in Torit, and in the following days in Juba, Yei, and Maridi. The immediate causes of the mutiny were a trial of a southern member of the national assembly and an allegedly false telegram urging northern administrators in the South to oppress Southerners. The mutinies were suppressed, though survivors fled the towns and began an uncoordinated insurgency in rural areas. Poorly armed and unorganized, they were little threat to the outgoing colonial power or the newly formed Sudanese government. O'Ballance, writing in 1977, says that the 'period from 1955 to 1963 was simply one of guerilla survival, scarcely removed from banditry, and that it was successful due to a score or so of former southern army officers and warrant officers, and a small number of non-commissioned officers.' = Escalation of Military Intervention = The insurgents gradually developed into a secessionist movement composed of the 1955 mutineers and southern students. These groups formed the Anyanya guerrilla army. (Anyanya is also known as Anyanya 1 in comparison to Anyanya 2, which began with the 1974 mutiny of the military garrison in Akobo.) Starting from Equatoria, between 1963 and 1969, Anyanya spread throughout the other two southern provinces: Upper Nile and Bahr al Ghazal *and provided heavy pressure on the Northern army's ability to properly maneuver. However, the separatist movement was crippled by internal ethnic divisions between the \\"Nilotic\\" and \\"Equatorian\\" groups. O'Ballance writes that one of the Sudanese army's four infantry brigades had been stationed in Equatoria Province since 1955, being periodically reinforced as required. However, the government was unable to take advantage of the rebel's weaknesses because of their own factionalism and instability. The first independent government of Sudan, led by Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari, was quickly replaced by a stalemated coalition of various conservative forces, which was in turn overthrown in the coup d'état of Chief of Staff Brigadier Ibrahim Abboud in 1958. = October 1964 Protests = Resentment at the military government built up. On the evening of 20 October 1964, a raid by security forces on a seminar on \\"the Problem of the Southern Sudan\\" at the University of Khartoum sparked off nationwide protests and a general strike. Abboud ceded to the massive scale of civil disobedience by creating an interim government in October 1964. These events became widely known as the \\"October Revolution\\" of Sudan or the \\"October 1964 Revolution\\". These protests included the first appearance of Islamist Hassan al-Turabi, who was then a student leader. Between 1966 and 1969, a series of Islamist- dominated administrations proved unable to deal with the variety of ethnic, economic and conflict problems afflicting the country. After a second military coup on 25 May 1969, Col. Gaafar Nimeiry became Prime Minister and promptly outlawed political parties. Also during this time, the Anyanya insurgency took advantage of the unstable situations which enabled them to send their leaders and continue their operations abroad. = Political Turmoil = In-fighting between Marxist and non-Marxist factions in the ruling military class led to another coup in July 1971 and a short-lived administration by the Sudanese Communist Party before anti-Communist factions put Nimeiry back in control of the country. That same year, German national Rolf Steiner, who had been clandestinely advising the rebels, was captured in Kampala, Uganda and deported to Khartoum, where he was put on trial for his anti-government activities. Originally sentenced to death, he would serve three years in prison before being released following pressure from the West German Government. The Southern politicians, on the other hand, attempted to gain more political control and temporarily established multiple provisional governments in the South. They hoped to use diplomatic means to achieve autonomy and separation but due to their political factionalism, were ineffectual in comparison to the Anyanya Insurgency = Unified Southern Front = The South was first led by the late leader Aggrey Jaden; he left the movement in 1969 due to internal political disputes. In the same year Gordon Muortat Mayen was elected unanimously as the new leader of the South. Southern Sudan in this time changed their name to the Nile Republic and resumed warfare against Khartoum, however some of the former leader Jaden's troops would not accept a Dinka leader and fought against the Anyanya. In 1971, former army lieutenant Joseph Lagu formed a successful coup d'état against Gordon Muortat with help from Israel, which pledged him their support. In doing so, the defected Equatorian commander was able to unify these troops of guerrilla fighters under his Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM). This was the first time in the history of the warfare that a separatist movement had a unified command structure with the mutual objective to secede and build an independent state. It was also the first organization that could claim to speak for, and negotiate on behalf of, the entire south when the war ended. Mediation between the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), both of which spent years building up trust with the two combatants, eventually led to the Addis Ababa Agreement of March 1972 which marked the end of the conflict. Aftermath/ Impact Since the beginning of their independence to the Addis Ababa Agreement, five hundred thousand people, of whom only one in five was considered an armed combatant, were killed while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homes. The Addis Ababa Agreement was observed by Emperor Hail Selassie of Ethiopia and led to the establishment of a regional autonomy for South Sudan. It would be known as the Southern Regional Government and would have institutions such as a Regional Assembly and Executive Counsel serving as their legislative and executive branches. The brief interlude of peace become a relative calm and thriving period for Sudan. The agreement was able to address some of the critical grievances held by Southern Sudan to that of the Khartoum government. The immediate recognition of the region as sovereign and establishment of key political institutions were only a few examples of the major developments. Additionally, a new constitution was founded and Southern Sudan were led by localized law enforcement agencies than that from the Northern government. Despite these improvements, there was the prevention of the South's ability to have their own military and only remain autonomous under the Northern Sudanese regime. Therefore, the agreement proved only to be a temporary respite with no definitive means of peace keeping for the Southern Sudan. With the infringements by the north increasing social unrest in the south in the mid-1970s, this led to the 1983 army mutiny that sparked the Second Sudanese Civil War. A conflict that lasted for almost 22 years and contributed to the official independence of South Sudan. ReferencesBibliography *Ali, Taisier Mohamed Ahmed, and Robert O. Matthews.

Family In 1802 or 1803 he married Maria Adye, and they had at least three children. Exploration HMS Dorothea shown in The Expedition Driven into the Ice, 30 July 1818 by Frederick William Beechey HMS Trent in dangerous waters, 7 June 1818, in Arctic expeditions from British and foreign shores by D. Murray Smith In 1806, Buchan was appointed as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and from about 1808 to 1817 he operated in and around Newfoundland. In 1810 he was captain of HMS Adonis. In autumn 1810 he conducted an expedition to the River of Exploits. From there he and his men marched inland for 130 miles to establish contact with the dwindling native Beothuk population, one of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas in the region. Unfortunately, the expedition resulted in the death and decapitation of two marines at their hands.Pedley (1863), pp.262-4.Howley and Howley (2000) p.70-87.William James Mills, Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2003, In 1813 Adonis and the frigate escorted the Newfoundland fishing fleet back to Britain. The voyage was stormy and the vessels separated near the English Channel. Adonis regained the convoy but as they approached the Scilly Islands they encountered a French fleet. Adonis was too small meaningfully to defend the convoy and in fact only escaped by jettisoning all her guns.Howley and Howley (2000) p.177. The 1818 Spitzbergen expeditionAnthony Brandt,\\"The Man Who Ate His Boots', 2009, Chapter 1 was nearly the first the many Arctic expeditions that followed the Napoleonic Wars. It set out at the same time as that of John Ross into Baffin Bay. Both were prompted by the interest of John Barrow in Arctic exploration and the fact that in 1817 whalers reported that the normal ice between Greenland and Spitzbergen had disappeared.This was one year after the year without a summer The ships were HMS Dorothea (Captain Buchan, first lieutenant Arthur Fleming Morrell, astronomer George Fisher) and under John Franklin who was later famous for his disappearance in the Arctic. They left London on 4 April 1818 and reached Spitzbergen in June. They found that the ice had returned to normal. They entered Magdalena Bay on the west coast where they were frozen in for a few weeks. Escaping the bay they worked their way north through leads in the ice, often dragging the ships with ropes. By early July they were about 30 miles into the ice and could go no further. They were a little north of 80°, about the same latitude as northernmost Spitzbergen. No European had sailed this far north except William Scoresby. It took only nine days to return to open water, but almost immediately they were hit by a storm which threatened to drive them onto the ice. The storm died down but Dorothea was too damaged to continue in the Arctic. Franklin wanted to continue with Trent but Buchan overruled him. They reached home on 30 September. Buchan returned to Newfoundland in 1819. Although he intended to return the Beothuk woman Demasduwit to her people, she died of tuberculosis before he was able to make any additional contact with the Beothuk. Buchan later ordered additional efforts to return Demasduwit's niece, the Beothuk woman Shanawdithit, to her family but she refused to go with any European expedition. As far as she knew, all her people had died. Also, after having been with the English, she knew that any Beothuk people would sacrifice her in a religious redemption of those who had been killed before. Later work David Buchan was promoted to captain in the Royal Navy on 12 June 1823, but was removed from the active list the same year. He was appointed High Sheriff of Newfoundland from 1825 to 1835. Death In December 1838, he was declared lost at sea with the East Indiaman Upton Castle en route from Calcutta to England.

Grosvenor is credited with having built the magazine into the iconic publication that it is today. As President of the National Geographic Society, he assisted its rise to one of the world's largest and best known science and learning organizations, aided by the chronicling in its magazine of ambitious natural and cultural explorations around the globe.  Early life Grosvenor was born on October 28, 1875 to Lilian Waters and Edwin A. Grosvenor in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, (now known as Istanbul, Turkey). He was second cousin to U.S. President and U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Howard Taft.Grosvenor Family Papers, Manuscript Division, U.S. Library of Congress, 2000, revised April 2010. He was educated at Worcester Academy and at Robert College. He attended Amherst College and graduated with the A.B. degree magna cum laude in 1897.

(1914) Grosvenor was hired in 1899 as the first full-time employee of the National Geographic Society by Alexander Graham Bell, the Society's President at the time. He eventually was named Director, and later was elected President of the Society in 1920 after the death of Rear Admiral John E. Pillsbury, and remained editor of National Geographic magazine until 1954. Grosvenor advocated policies of neutrality and positive, upbeat journalism through two world wars, the Great Depression, and the beginning of the Cold War. This style was seen as innovative in the opening years of the 20th century. However, by the 1950s, Grosvenor's style was criticized as being ossified and dated. He and his staff (most of whom were in their late 60s and 70s) were criticized as being conservative, complacent, and unwilling to modernize, and the National Geographic's subscription base fell as a consequence. After 50 years at the helm, he stepped down in 1954 at the age of 78. = Support for the National Park Service = Grosvenor traveled in California with Stephen Mather and helped write the act that created the National Parks. Grosvenor first traveled to the western United States in 1915 to hike with Stephen Mather in the Sierra Mountains and what is now Sequoia National Park. \\"Grosvenor was so overwhelmed by the grandeur of the High Sierras and his experience on the trip that he became a revered and long-time friend of Mather and the national parks,\\" according to National Park Service historian Walter Bielenberg. Following his return, Grosvenor provided funding to buy Giant Forest and add it to Sequoia National Park. For years, opposition in Congress had prevented creation of a national system of parks. In late 1915 and 1916, Grosvenor met with Stephen Mather, Horace Albright, and others to draft the Organic Act, which would create a National Park Service. He then created a special issue of National Geographic (April 1916) entitled \\"The Land of the Best\\" to promote the importance of parks and encouraged readers to support creation of a national system. He and Albright made sure that every member of Congress had a copy of the issue. Their efforts worked, and that year legislation finally passed that would establish the National Park Service. Grosvenor continued involvement with the National Parks over the years. He became very involved in protecting the Katmai volcanic crater and Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes from mining exploitation, and helped to establish Katmai National Monument in 1918. Katmai National Park's Grosvenor Lodge is named after him.

After the October 1945 election Knud Kristensen formed the Cabinet of Knud Kristensen (Regeringen Knud Kristensen), a minority government consisting only of his Liberal party (Venstre) . Biography Knud Kristensen was educated in agriculture and was a farmer by profession. He was from 1901–02 a student at Frederiksborg University College, 1903–04 at Dalum Agricultural School and 1906–07 at Askov Folk High School. In 1907–20, he owned a farm at Ødsted in Vejle, then Biviumgård in Humlebæk. He was first elected to the parliament in 1920. He was re-elected from 1932 until he resigned on 15 January 1949. In social policy, Kristensen's time as Prime minister saw the passage of the National Social Insurance act of June 1946, which raised benefits and, although it increased the age limit for old age pensions for men from 60 to 65, it granted old-age pensions to people from the age of 60 in cases of ill- health or special circumstances. Under the Building Subsidy Act of April 1946 low interest rates were made available to central government to support housing construction for the needy, while rent supplements were introduced for families with smaller children. Kristensen resigned as Prime Minister when the Folketing passed a vote of no confidence because of his failed enthusiasm for incorporating Southern Schleswig into Denmark. Denmark was forced to cede Schleswig and Holstein in the second war of Schleswig in 1864, and had recovered parts of Northern Schleswig in the aftermath of World War I as a result of the Schleswig Plebiscite, but had failed to regain Southern Schleswig. Denmark's new attempt of re-annexation in the vacuum of power after WW2 was unsuccessful due to the opposition of South Schleswig's inhabitants. German public opinion was supported by the British military governor Hugh Champion de Crespigny who feared the chaos that would arise in view of the doubled German population within the area after ingesting expellees of former German territories handed to Poland. The defeat in the Southern Schleswig case estranged Kristensen from his party and when the new constitution was issued 1953 he terminated his membership of Venstre and founded a new party, the Independent Party (De Uafhængige). This new party was unable to gain influence. ReferencesOther sources *Kristian Hvidt (1995) Statsministre i Danmark fra 1913 til 1995 (Copenhagen: Nyt nordisk forlag A.

She formerly carried the Soviet Navy pennant number B-435. Zaporizhzhia was designed at the Rubin Design Bureau (Saint Petersburg). Captured by Russian forces on 22 March 2014 (during the 2014 Crimean crisis), most of the Ukrainian personnel, among them the captain of the submarine, had left the vessel, while the others had chosen to begin their service in the Russian Black Sea Fleet with the submarine. Zaporizhzhia had a crew of 78, commanded by 1st Rank Capt. Oleh Orlov. The submarine was operated by a reserve unit, having not yet returned to front line duty after her 'refurbishment'. Subsequent events in the Crimean Crisis have revealed that the vessel is barely seaworthy and too obsolete for active service of any type. History Zaporizhzhias keel was laid down in 1970 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad. In 1970 she was commissioned into the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet, where she conducted 14 patrols, including a port call in Cuba. In 1990 the submarine was transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, serving there until 1994. In 1995, the submarine's batteries permanently failed and she became abandoned without their replacement. In 1997 unable to fix the unused submarine, the administration of Russian Navy handed it over to the Ukrainian Navy during the partition of the Black Sea Fleet. Like most of the country's naval ships, she was renamed after one of Ukraine's cities – Zaporizhzhia. The city's community began to co-sponsor the ship, especially the accommodation needs of the crew. But it was only in 2003 when Ukrainian government was able to buy a new batteries set abroad and make Zaporizhzhias survival real. However, she was immediately placed under repair in Sevastopol. In 2005, Zaporizhzhia was considered for inclusion in the 2006 joint exercise conducted by the Ukrainian Navy and the Italian Navy, but the end of her repair was postponed. Being on a years-long repair, Zaporizhzhia was an inactive military unit stated Defense Minister Anatoly Hrytsenko in April 2006. In January 2007, (Defense Minister) Hrytsenko stated that Ukraine intended to sell Zaporizhzhia. As of July 2010 Zaporizhzhia was preparing for trials after repairs. All repairs were finished on 17 April 2011. The first trial sail was finished successfully on 18 July 2012. Late June 2013 all long- term maintenance work and tests were completed. On 22 March 2014, it was reported that the submarine had been taken over by Russian forces after being surrounded and harassed by Russian Navy ships, who demanded its surrender. The commander of the ship reportedly agreed to surrender his ship, then started flying the Russian Navy flag. Zaporizhzhia was placed under Black Sea Fleet control, after Ukrainian symbols were removed from the submarine. Half of the submarine's crew continued to serve in the Russian Navy. On 29 March 2014, the Black Sea Fleet was reported to have refused to add the submarine to its ranks on the grounds that it was obsolete and suffered from a number of technical issues. The Russian Navy then offered to return Zaporizhzhia to Ukraine to either continue its service or to be recycled as scrap-metal. It was reported the submarine would be transferred from the Streletskaya buhta to Yuzhnaya buhta, where the Russian submarine division is. Later sources in the Russian Navy announced that submarine should be returned to Ukrainian Navy. Later (it was reported) Russia decided not to return the submarine to Ukraine. But in mid-May the submarine was scheduled to be returned to Ukraine, where it was likely to become a museum piece. A part of the Ukrainian Navy was then returned to Ukraine but Russia suspended this agreement before returning submarine Zaporizhzhia because/after Ukraine did not renew its unilaterally declared ceasefire on 1 July 2014 in the War in Donbass. Hence Zaporizhzhia was not returned to Ukraine. Ship log From September to November 1970, submarine was at sea for 20 days, 422 hours (236 submerged, 186 surfaced). The vessel traveled while surfaced and while submerged. The submarine completed 15 submerges, and used 125 tons of fuel. During the service in the Atlantic Ocean in June through December 1971, the submarine was at sea for 210 days. It traveled while surfaced and while submerged. The submarine completed 71 submerges, and used 825 tons of fuel. During 27 June to 10 August 1972 Zaporizhzhia underwent medium repairs. From July to October 1994, the submarine was at sea for 16 days. The submarine travelled while surfaced and while submerged. In January 1995 Zaporizhzhia traveled only in 4 hours while being towed.

W. F. 1974. The mammals of Canada. Toronto, University of Toronto Press. Description They have short slender bodies with a rust-colored back, light brown sides and underparts and a short thick tail. Their short ears are visible through their fur. They are 14 cm long with a 3.5 cm tail and weigh about 30 to 40 g. Their dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3. They are active year-round, usually at night. They can cause damage to fruit trees and stored grains. Plant communities Northern red-backed voles live in a variety of northern forest and shrubland habitats. They occur in every major forest type in central Alaska. Plant species commonly found in areas occupied by northern red-backed voles include black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), alder (Alnus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis- idaea), blueberry and bilberry (Vaccinium spp.), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), and a variety of grasses and forbs. Important fungi, mosses and lichens include truffle (Endogone fascilulata), Schreber's moss (Pleurozium schreberi), mountain fern moss (Hylocomium splendens), sphagnum (Sphagnum spp.), and lichens (Cladonia and Peltigera spp.). Timing of major life events The breeding season of northern red-backed voles generally extends from May to August. Females are polyestrous and produce two or three litters during the breeding season. The first litter is produced in late May or early June. Litter size ranges from four to nine. The average litter size is 5.93. Young northern red-backed voles are unable to regulate their temperature successfully until about 18 days. At this time they are weaned and leave the nest. Young grow little during the winter because of low food supplies. Age of sexual maturity depends to some extent on time of birth. About 20% of females from the first litter breed during the summer of birth. The remaining 80%, and later litters, breed the following May. Martell and Fuller found that the onset of summer breeding was related to the time of snowmelt. A late spring was followed by a low rate of maturation of young-of-the-year females. In dense populations of northern red-backed voles, sexual maturation of young females may be delayed, or they may migrate to a vacant breeding space. Northern red-backed voles are mainly nocturnal and crepuscular but are of necessity about during the prolonged arctic daylight season. Preferred habitat Northern red-backed voles are commonly found in northern shrub vegetation or open taiga forests. They also inhabit tundra. Northern red- backed voles are abundant on early successional sites as well as in mature forests. They occasionally inhabit rock fields and talus slopes. Northern red- backed voles use surface runways through the vegetation as travel corridors. Nests are built in short burrows or under some protective object such as a rock or root. Northern red-backed voles are active all winter and construct long tunnels under the snow. Winter nests typically are placed on the ground among thick moss. Northern red-backed voles frequently invade houses during the winter. Cover requirements Northern red-backed voles inhabit areas that contain dense ground cover for protection from weather and predation. On the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in south-central Alaska, the presence of northern red-backed voles was positively correlated with protective cover. During the winter, northern red-backed voles use layers of thick moss or matted vegetation as thermal cover. During the mid-winter months in a spruce forest of central Alaska, all northern red-backed voles on a control area aggregated in a small area of thick moss cover, despite abundant food resources elsewhere on the trapping grid. Food habits Northern red-backed voles eat the leaves, buds, twigs and berries of numerous shrubs; they also eat forbs, fungi, mosses, lichens, and occasionally insects. Berries are generally the major food item in the diet of northern red-backed voles and are eaten whenever available. In central Alaska, West found that northern red- backed voles relied heavily upon the fruits of several berry-producing plants during all seasons. These included bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), mountain cranberry, black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), comandra (Comandra livida), and bunchberry. Northern red-backed voles primarily ate berries during the fall and winter. Lichens were consumed only during the winter and spring. In early summer, when berries are not available, mosses were eaten. The mid- to late summer diet of northern red-backed voles also included a large proportion of mosses, although berries were still the primary food. Northern red-backed voles on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge fed during the summer on berries of species such as mountain cranberry and bunchberry. They also ate fungi, succulent green plants, and insects. As fungi became plentiful late in the summer, they made up a large percentage of the diet. Mountain cranberry consumption declined as the summer progressed even though berry abundance increased. This suggests that fungi were preferred over mountain cranberries. The amount of truffle in the diet remained constant throughout the summer. Predators Some predators of northern red-backed voles include American marten (Martes americana), Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), raccoon (Procyon lotor), short-tail weasel (Mustela erminea), coyote (Canis latrans),Wein, R. W. 1975. Vegetation recovery in arctic tundra and forest-tundra after fire. ALUR Rep. 74-75-62. Ottawa, ON: Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Arctic Land Use Research Program and probably most other predators of small mammals that occur within the range of northern red-backed voles. In Alaska, northern red-backed voles and voles (Microtus spp.) comprised 74% of the diet of American martens in the summer and 68% of the diet during the winter. Snowy Owls eat voles.

GST in New Zealand is designed to be a broad-based system with few exemptions, such as for rents collected on residential rental properties, donations, precious metals and financial services. Because it is broad based, it collects 31.4% of total taxation, making New Zealand the highest taxed country in the OECD in terms of sales tax as a proportion of GDP. The rate for GST effective since 1 October 2010 is 15%. This 15% tax is applied to the final price of the product or service being purchased and goods and services are advertised as GST inclusive. Background GST was introduced by the Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand on 1 October 1986 at a rate of 10% on most goods and services. It replaced existing sales taxes for some goods and services. GST was a part of the economic reforms initiated by Labour Finance Minister Roger Douglas dubbed Rogernomics. GST was introduced in conjunction with compensating changes to personal income tax rates and removal of many excise taxes on imported goods. Since its introduction it has had two increases, on 1 July 1989 the rate increased to 12.5% and on 1 October 2010 it increased again to 15%. How it works GST-registered organisations and individuals pay GST only on the difference between GST-liable sales and GST-liable supplies (i.e., they pay GST on the difference between what they sell and what they buy: income less expenditure). This is accomplished by reconciling GST received (through sales) and GST paid (through purchases) at regular periods (typically every two months, with some qualifying companies opting for one-month or six-month periods), then either paying the difference to the Inland Revenue (IRD) if the GST collected on sales is higher or receiving a refund from IRD if the GST paid on purchases is higher. Businesses exporting goods and services from New Zealand are entitled to \\"zero-rate\\" their products: effectively, they charge GST at 0%. This permits the business to claim back the input GST, but the eventual, non-New Zealand based consumer does not pay the tax (businesses that produce GST-exempt supplies are not able to claim back input GST). Because businesses claim back their input GST, the GST inclusive price is usually irrelevant for business purchasing decisions, other than in relation to cash flow issues. Consequently, wholesalers often state prices exclusive of GST, but must collect the full, GST-inclusive price when they make the sale and account to the IRD for the GST so collected.  Digital services supplied by offshore companies  On 1 October 2016, the taxation of digital ('remote') services supplied by offshore companies (non-New Zealand) to consumers based in New Zealand changed. Since that date, a GST of 15% (dubbed the 'Netflix Tax'\\"Netflix tax\\" bill passed - New Zealand Parliament, 11 May 2016Entertainment bargains likely ahead of 'Netflix tax' in October - Stuff.co.nz, 15 August 2016) is applied to all supplies from offshore digital service suppliers to New Zealand-based consumers.GST on \\"remote\\" services - Deloitte, April 2016 It is the supplier's responsibility to apply, collect and remit the new GST to New Zealand's Inland Revenue Department. That new piece of GST legislation mirrors similar rules governing the supply of digital services introduced in the European Union (EU) in January 2015 on the taxation of digital goods. The general taxation of digital goods and services has become more common internationally since the OECD released its long-awaited BEPS report in October 2015. Action 1 of the report deals with the taxation of the digital economy. The report provided guidelines and recommendations for such taxes be they in the form of value-added tax, GST, equalisation levy, or withholding tax. Friday, 19 October 2018 New Zealand is the latest jurisdiction to include such rules in legislation following in the path of Norway, the EU, South Africa, South Korea, and Japan. In July 2017, the Australian government also plans to introduce similar rules.

Legislative history The Act was passed in response to the Supreme Court's declaration that the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was unconstitutional. These two acts were passed as legislation in an attempt to cut crop and livestock surplus. Originally, Congress enacted the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 , on April 27, 1935 in an attempt to address farm erosion problems by bringing within its policy and purposes, the improvements and preservation of national soil resources. During the second session of the 74th Congress, the U.S. Congressional session amended the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 by passing and renaming the legislation the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act with the express purpose of encouraging the use of soil resources in such a manner as to preserve and improve fertility, promote economic use, and diminish the exploitation and unprofitable use of the national soil resources.S.rp.1481, 'Conservation and Utilization of the Soil Resources' Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. Senate, January 16, 1936. Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Act into law on February 29, 2036.  Provisions It meant to help with some of the problems with the previous Act, most notably its failure to protect sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Landlords were now required to share the payments they received from the government for cutting back production with those who worked on their land. The Act also gave directives to conserve the soil in the \\"high plains\\" - soil that was being raised into huge dust bowls during the 1930s. This period, known as the Dust Bowl, coupled with the economic hardships of the Great Depression, hit farmers particularly hard. The act attempted to correct earlier government policy that encouraged farmers to use their land without concern to the repercussions. The result of these agricultural methods (mostly the way farmers plowed their land) made it vulnerable to the winds. The dry ground, now exposed, rose up to create the \\"black storms\\". The Act both educated farmers on how to use their lands without damaging them, and took immediate action to contain the dust bowl's effects - notably by planting trees and native grass.  Result Three years after the Act was adopted, soil erosion (soil being raised by winds) had dropped 21.7%.

It features 14 floats with lights that depict images of sea creatures. Though it has changed somewhat since its debut in 1971, it remains one of the few original opening year shows to still be running at Walt Disney World. 1971 Version On Monday October 25, 1971; the Electrical Water Pageant premiered on the Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake for \\"Dedication Day\\" at Walt Disney World. In addition to the 14 floats, its opening night included fireworks and pyrotechnics launched from the 14 floats and an additional float behind the Electrical Water Pageant. All of this was filmed by Walt Disney Productions and edited down for inclusion into The Wonderful World of Disney's Episode: \\"The Grand Opening of Walt Disney World\\", which aired on NBC on Friday October 29, 1971. The Paul Beaver version of Gershon Kingsley & Jean-Jacques Perrey's \\"Baroque Hoedown\\", created specially for the Electrical Water Pageant, was used from 1971 until 1977. The original Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland used the same soundtrack from 1972 until 1974. In 1977, the premiers of the updated version of the Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade and new (but similar) Walt Disney World Main Street Electrical Parade used a new version of \\"Baroque Hoedown\\" updated by Don Dorsey. The original lineup of floats for the Electrical Water Pageant were: * Sea Serpent (three floats) * Whale (one float) * Two Sea Lions Playing With a Ball (one float) * Clamshell Opening and Closing revealing a mermaid (one float) * Three Goldfishes swimming in bubbles (one float) * Three Jumping Dolphins (three floats) * Three Red-Haired Mermaids (one float) * Octopus (one float) * Three Flying Fish (one float) * Four Seahorses (one float) * Neptune (one float) While the 1971 version of \\"Baroque Hoedown\\" would play along with the Electrical Water Pageant through 1976, Disney melodies were added to the track and some of the floats were repositioned and others completely changed in 1972; and remained that way through 1976. While the track was essentially the same as what was heard during the Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland, an oscillator swoop was heard during the music transitions in the Electrical Water Pageant. The 1972 to 1976 lineup of floats for the Electrical Water Pageant were: * Sea Serpent (three floats) * Two Sea Lions Playing With a Ball (one float) * Whale (one float) * Turtle (one float) * Shrimp (one float) * Three Jumping Dolphins (three floats) * Three Flying Fish (one float) * Octopus (one float) (updated version of the 1971 Octopus) * Four Seahorses (one float) * Neptune (one float) 1977 to 1995 Version With the return of the Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade in an updated form along with the brand new Walt Disney World Main Street Electrical Parade, a new version of Jean-Jacques Perry & Gershon Kingsley's \\"Baroque Hoedown\\" was created in 1977 to be used with both parades respectively featuring an updated rendition of Barque Hoedown recorded by Don Dorsey. To help distinguish the Electrical Water Pageant from the Main Street Electrical Parade, the original Kingsley- Perry version of \\"Baroque Hoedown\\" was dropped and a new version using various musical selections was created for both the opening and closing of the Electrical Water Pageant as well as each creature depicted in the pageant. Some of the original 1971 floats were saved or rearranged, while others were completely changed. The main themes for this version of the Electrical Water Pageant were synthesized arrangements from George Frideric Handel's Water Music.

The only difference is in 1996 when a new musical score was created for both the opening and closing of the Electrical Water Pageant as well as each creature depicted in the pageant.

He was a key member of, and influence on, Fluxus, the international group of avant-garde artists centred on George Maciunas, having been involved with the group from the first performances in Wiesbaden 1962 until Maciunas' death in 1978.

Six Years, Lucy R Lippard, University of California Press, 1973, p11Brecht used the term as early as 1957-58 in an essay Project in Multiple Dimensions; 'The primary function of my art seems to be an expression of maximum meaning with a minimal image, that is, the achievement of an art of multiple implications, through simple, even austere, means. This is accomplished, it seems to me, by making use of all available conceptual and material resources.' Quoted in Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, K Stiles, P Selz, University of California Press, 1996 p333 He described his own art as a way of “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.”  Biography  Koan, from the Toward Events Exhibition, Reuben Gallery, NY, 1959.

Initially influenced by Jackson Pollock, and Robert Rauschenberg - Rauschenberg's exhibition of grass seeds, Growing Painting, 1954, left 'a significant impression on him' \\\\- he began to formulate ideas about 'chance method schemes' that would eventually be printed as a booklet by the Something Else Press as Chance Imagery (1957/66). The work was 'a systematic investigation of the role of chance in the 20th century in the fields of science and avant-garde art... reveal[ing] his respect for Dadaist and surrealist projects as well as for the more complex aspects of the work of Marcel Duchamp, whom he considered the embodiment of the 'artist- researcher'.Essay on Brecht by Julia Robinson, for MACBA, Barcelona Artworks in this period included bed-sheets stained with ink he called Chance Paintings. In 1957, Brecht sought out the artist Robert Watts, after seeing his work exhibited at Douglass College, Rutgers University, where Watts taught. This led to lunch meetings once a week for a number of years at a cafe between the university and Brecht's laboratory.An Interview with George Brecht Watts' colleague Allan Kaprow would also regularly attend these informal meetings. Discussions at these lunches would lead directly to the setting up of the Yam Festival, 1962–63, by Watts and Brecht, seen as one of the most important precursors to Fluxus.Essay on Fluxus by Michael Corris, MOMA online The meetings also led to both Brecht and Kaprow attending John Cage's class at The New School for Social Research, New York, often driving down together from New Brunswick. =John Cage and the New School for Social Research= Brecht studied with John Cage between 1958 and 1959,According to Julia Robinson, the first event score was 'Time-table Music', in which the whole class went to Grand Central Station 'where they used train timetables to create a composition, timing their visual, auditory and perceptual observations at the site.' see during which time he invented, and then refined, the Event ScoreKristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 333Alison Knowles Website which would become a central feature of Fluxus. Typically, Event Scores are simple instructions to complete everyday tasks which can be performed publicly, privately, or negatively (i.e., deciding not to perform them at all). These ideas would be taken up and expanded upon up by La Monte Young, Yoko Ono and many other avant-garde artists who passed through these classes.Allan Kaprow in conversation with Sidney Simon, early 70's. Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264 The two had originally met in 1957 when Brecht heard that Cage was planning to hunt mushrooms in the New Jersey area; he rang him up and invited him to 'stop by and say hello'. Cage accepted, and returned the invitation; it was whilst Brecht, Kaprow and their families were visiting his house in Stony Point on the Hudson, that Cage invited them to attend his classes in New York. Ironically, musicians found the course far harder than the visual artists who had enrolled; > \\"Cage... was very keenly a philosophical mind, not just an artist's mind; > his sense of aesthetics was secondary and thought was primary. He impressed > me immediately. So I thought, well, who cares if he's a musician and I'm a > painter. This is unimportant. It's the mind that transcends any medium..... > \\"The rate of attrition was something fierce. The end result was that there > were very few musician types and the event nature of the class became > apparent. George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far > greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really > came to life in that situation..... He became a leader; and immediately he > influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. > George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg.\\" Allan > Kaprow Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest Happenings, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd \\"never felt so controlled before.\\"Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois prompting Brecht to pare the scores down to haiku-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed. Brecht would later refer to Cage as his 'liberator', whilst, in the opinion of some critics,George Brecht, Oxford Art Online moving beyond Cage's notion of music; Cage was still writing scores to be performed. Brecht had replaced this with a world permeated with music. \\"No matter what you do,\\" he said, \\"you're always hearing something.\\" In October 1959, fresh from studying with Cage, Brecht organised his first one-man show at the Reuben Gallery, New York. Called Towards Events: An Arrangement, it was neither an exhibition of objects or a performance, but somewhere in between.George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p34 Comprising works that emphasised time, the works could be manipulated by the viewer in various ways, revealing sounds, smells and tactile textures. One, Case, instructed viewers to unpack the contents and to use them 'in ways appropriate to their nature.' This work would become Valoche (see ), the last Fluxus multiple that George Maciunas, the 'Chairman' of Fluxus, would work on before his death 19 years later.Koan, from the same show, would also be considered as a Fluxus multiple, but only got so far as two incomplete maquettes, renamed 'A Question or More'. See Fluxus Codex, p183 New York avant-gardeFlute Solo= In a frequently retold anecdote used to describe the origins of one of Brecht's most personal Event Scores, the artist recalled an incident when his father had a 'nervous breakdown ' during a rehearsal at the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra; > '[A] soprano was bugging everybody with temper tantrums during rehearsal. At > a certain point the orchestra crashed onto a major seventh and there was > silence for the soprano and flute cadenza. Nothing happened. The soprano > looked into the orchestra pit and saw that my father had completely taken > apart his flute, down to the last screw. (I used this idea in my 1962 FLUTE > SOLO).' George Brecht GB in interview with Michael Nyman, quoted in George > Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p284 Michael Nyman, the interviewer, responded that in Brecht's work \\"sound- producing instruments [in the Event-Scores] have been made mute (the violin, in Solo for Violin Viola Cello or Contrabass, is polished, not played), and non-sounding instruments, or non-instruments, for instance a comb (Comb Music, 1962) are made sounding.\\" Another piece, Solo for Wind Instrument, contained the single instruction (putting it down). Later in his life, when asked about his father, Brecht replied that \\"[he] gave up music-making in the mid-'30s by lying down and not breathing any more on the couch at 165 W. 82nd Street, where we were living at the time.\\" =The Yam Festival= As Brecht's interest in Event Scores began to dominate his output, he started to mail small cards bearing the scores to various friends \\"like little enlightenments I wanted to communicate to my friends who would know what to do with them.Brecht quoted in A Heterospective, p70\\" This method of distribution - soon to become known as mail art - would become the basis for the buildup to the Yam Festival (May backwards), mid 1962-May 1963, organised with Robert Watts. The mailed scores were intended to build anticipation for a monthlong series of events held in New York and on George Segal's farm, New Jersey. Featuring a large cross section of avant-garde artists, the festival was based around the idea of operating 'as an alternative to the gallery system, producing art that could not be bought'.A Heterospective, p68 Artists participating in the festival included Alison Knowles, Allan Kaprow, John Cage, Al Hansen, Ay-O, Dick Higgins, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ray Johnson. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. One of the recipients of the mail shots (as well as a participant in the festival) was La Monte Young. Young, a musician who had arrived in New York September 1960,Four musical minimalists: La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass By Keith Potter, p49 had been asked to guest edit a special edition of Beatitude East on avant-garde art, which evolved into the seminal compendium, An Anthology Of Chance (see ) Brecht was the first artist listed in the compendium; the graphic designer and publisher of the book was George Maciunas, who had been attending the same music classes, although by now they were being given by Richard Maxfield. =George Maciunas and the beginnings of Fluxus= Fluxus was to grow out of Maciunas' friendship with the artists centred on these classes; his conception of Fluxus was based on LEF, a communist organisation set up in Russia in the 1920s to help create a new socialist culture LEF program:'LEF shall agitate art with the ideas of the commune, opening for art the road to tomorrow.' Whilst it is unlikely Brecht agreed with Maciunas politically, he strongly agreed with the notion of the unprofessional status of the artist, the de-privileging of the author, and appreciated Maciunas' ability at organisation and design. > 'The people in Fluxus had understood, as Brecht explained, that \\"concert > halls, theaters, and art galleries\\" were \\"mummifying.\\" Instead, these > artists found themselves \\"preferring streets, homes, and railway > stations....\\" Maciunas recognized a radical political potential in all this > forthrightly anti-institutional production, which was an important source > for his own deep commitment to it. Deploying his expertise as a professional > graphic designer, Maciunas played an important role in projecting upon > Fluxus whatever coherence it would later seem to have had.' Brecht quoted in > A Heterospective, p118 Brecht would remain a prominent member of Fluxus until Maciunas' death, 1978. His work was included in each of the major Festum Fluxorum performances in Europe, 1962–63; in Fluxus 1, 1963, the first Flux Yearbook; as part of the various Fluxkits, collecting works by the group together; and was a key part of Flux performances and objects right up to the Flux Harpsichord Concert, 1976 and the last Flux Cabinets. An indication of his importance within the group is captured in a letter from Maciunas to Emmett Williams, April 1963, concerning plans Maciunas had been formulating with the marxist intellectual Henry Flynt; > 'Bad news! George Brecht wants out of Fluxus, thinks Fluxus is getting too > aggressive (this newsletter No.6 [Propaganda through pickets and > demonstrations, sabotage and disruption]). So we will have to compromise, > find a midpoint between Flynt, Paik & Brecht (if a midway can be found!) It > would be very bad without Brecht. He is the best man in New York (I > think)....' George Maciunas quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, > Thames and Hudson, 1997, p95-96 It was Maciunas who conceived of (and published) Water Yam, a collection of around 70 of Brecht's event scores packaged in a cardboard box Or wooden in the case of the de-luxe edition, or plastic in later editions published in Wiesbaden, April 1963. The first Fluxbox, it was intended to be part of a series of boxes containing the complete works of each of the members of Fluxus. In keeping with Maciunas' principles, the boxes were neither numbered or signed, and originally sold for $4.Price listed in the Fluxus Preview Review, July 1963, quoted in the Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217 Many of his other Fluxus multiples involved absurdist puzzles which were impossible to resolve in a traditional manner (see ). Fluxus Works Drip Music, 1963, Performed during Festum Fluxorum/Das Instrumentale Theater February 2, 1963 =Other works= Whilst the pieces he made for the Fluxus cooperative remain his most famous works, he continued to exhibit artworks within more traditional gallery spaces throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these works played with the notion of the Readymade, attempting to retain the pieces' functionality. Chairs feature in a lot of these works; the earliest was Three Chair Events exhibited at the Martha Jackson Gallery, NY, 1961. Three Chair Events > • Sitting on a black chair. Occurrence. > • Yellow Chair. (Occurrence.) > • On (or near) a white chair. Occurrence, > > Spring 1961 > For the exhibition, the white chair was spot-lit in the middle of the gallery with a stack of Three Chair Events scores placed nearby on a window sill. The black chair was placed in the bathroom, whilst the yellow chair was placed outside on the street, and was being sat on by Claes Oldenburg's mother - deep in conversation - when Brecht arrived for the private view.A Heterospective, p56 A later piece, Chair With A History, 1966, part of a series Brecht worked on in Rome, featured a chair with a red book placed on it inviting the occupier to add 'whatever was happening' as part of an ongoing record of the chair's history (see ). Other series of works included signs - often readymade - with simple statements on, such as 'Exit' or 'Notice Green' embossed in a red sign next to 'Notice Red' embossed on a green one (see ). Brecht started a series called The Book of the Tumbler on Fire in 1964, and exhibited the first 56 at the Fischback Gallery NY in early 1965, shortly before leaving the US. The pieces consisted of framed collages, made of cotton-filled specimen boxes, designed to show \\"the continuity of unlike things.\\" A Heterospective, p144 Brecht would pursue this series for over a decade, with each piece being referred to as a 'page'. Europe Untitled (Blackboard map of Europe) from the series Land Mass Translocations, 1970, private collection, Vaduz =The Cedilla That Smiles= Maciunas' decision to picket a Stockhausen concert of Originale in August 1964 is often seen as the point at which the original, 'heroic' era of Fluxus splintered;The Origins of Culture Stewart Home the move seems to have alienated Brecht Drama/theatre/performance By Simon Shepherd, Mick Wallis, p93 who, whilst not severing relations, left New York in the spring of 1965 for Europe, despite Cage allegedly spending a whole evening trying to persuade him to stay.Brecht for Beginners, Anna Dezeuze He arrived in Rome, April 1965; from there he moved to Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, to start a shop, La Cédille qui Sourit, (The Cedilla That Smiles), with the French artist Robert Filliou, another member of FluxusCf. Fleurice Würz: \\"Fluxus Nice, 1963-1968\\", AQ-Verlag, Saarbrücken 2011, , p. 70ff. in French.. The shop was intended to explore ideas about the 'obtuse relationship(s) to the institution of language'George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p318 but instead ushered in what he described cheerfully as \\"accelerated creative inactivity\\". =Land Mass Translocations= After the shop closed in 1968, Brecht moved to London, where he formed a new company, 'Brecht and MacDiarmid', which proposed a number of Land Mass Translocations. As a pilot project, Brecht suggested moving the Isle of Wight westward to Portland Bill. > \\"One of us (GB) proposed in 1966 that the Arctic ice pack be interchanged > with the Antarctic, and in the winter of 1967-8, in London, the idea of > moving England closer to the equator presented itself. This intuition was > reinforced by recent scientific studies which have shown that England is > being tilted... at a rate such that areas of London 15 meters above sea > level or less will be submerged in 1500 years time. Considering that London > has been an inhabited place for at least 2000 years, this is not as remote > an event as it seems. In this light, Brecht and MacDiarmid are undertaking > research into the feasibility of moving land masses over the surface of the > earth..... Movement of the Isle of Wight would be a pilot project for the > larger translocation of England.\\" George Brecht, B.Sc.George Brecht quoted > in Land Mass Translocations information sheet, 1969 In November 1969, Cornelius Cardew's Scratch Orchestra (see ) performed Realization of the Journey of the Isle of Wight Westwards by Iceberg to Tokyo Bay, a piece based on Brecht's Translocations, in London. Other imagined moves included Cuba moving alongside Miami, and Iceland moving next to Spain. Void Stone, 1987, Arp-Museum, Rolandseck =Translating the Hsin-Hsin-Ming= As part of his lifelong interest in Zen Buddhism, Brecht began a focused study of the Chinese language with the aim of translating the ancient text the Hsin- Hsin-Ming by Seng Ts'an, c600 AD, in 1976. The book, published in 1980, included three autonomous translations; an English version by Brecht, a French one by Filliou and a German version by A Fabri. It also included calligraphy by Takako Saito. Other works completed in this period include a series of Crystal Boxes, containing constantly transforming crystals; a performance and lecture 'with slides, music and fireworks' called The Chemistry of Music given at the ICA; The Brunch Museum, an exhibition dedicated to relics associated with the (fictional) character WE Brunch; a play entitled 'Silent Music' broadcast on West German Radio as part of celebrations for John Cage's 75th birthday; and 3 large sculptures, called Void Stones, commissioned for the Skulptur Projekte Münster. > '[The Chemistry of Music & The Brunch Museum are two of the] three projects > that Brecht called “meta-creations”. The first, from 1968, is a slide-based > lecture under the title The Chemistry of Music, which offers a critique of > the lecture format as the predominating method of teaching. The second, The > San Antonio Installation, is based on extracts from a popular series of > French detective novels by the author San Antonio. The excerpts consist in > an eccentric collection of articles (many of them found in French flea > markets) which materialise details of the narrations and which present a > kind of antidote against passive experience – in this case, the mechanical > absorption of cheap literature. The third project is The Brunch Museum, an > ingenious “exhibited object” of the life and work of W. E. Brunch, an > imaginary figure of “great historical importance” invented by Brecht and the > artist Stephan Kukowski (now Stephan Shakespeare). As in the case of the > lecture model and novel, this project challenges institutionalised forms of > representation and dissemination of information.' Museum of Contemporary > Art, Barcelona =Last years= Whilst his work continued to be included in a number of major group shows, by 1989 he would refer to himself as 'retired from fluxus'. Becoming increasingly reclusive, he only allowed two retrospectives of his work in the last 30 years of his life; both were called 'A Heterospective' (loosely translated as a 'Collection of Othernesses'). The second, a large museum exhibition that was shown in Cologne and Barcelona, 2005–06, opened with a simple sign marked 'End' and ended with another stating 'Start'.Guardian Obituary. In 2006 he won the prestigious Berliner Kunstpreis. From late 1971 Brecht lived in Cologne, where he died, after a number of years of failing health, on 5 December 2008. His first marriage ended in 1963; he married for a second time, to Hertha Klang, in 2002. He lived with Donna Jo Brewer for a number of years between. > \\"John Cage seems to think that if he contacts the most people possible, they > (or someone) will understand.

Both buildings were designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by W. G. R. Sprague. The Aldwych Theatre was funded by Seymour Hicks in association with the American impresario Charles Frohman, and built by Walter Wallis of Balham. The theatre opened on 23 December 1905 with a production of Blue Bell, a new version of Hicks's popular pantomime Bluebell in Fairyland. In 1906, Hicks's The Beauty of Bath, followed in 1907 by The Gay Gordons, played at the theatre. In February 1913, the theatre was used by Serge Diaghilev and Vaslav Nijinsky for the first rehearsals of Le Sacre du Printemps before its première in Paris during May.Lucas, John.

At the time, several Norwegian settlers lived on the peninsula. After the Russian Revolution, the western parts of Sredny and Rybachy were ceded to Finland.

The friars and sisters were founded in 1898 as a religious community in the Episcopal Church. The religious order is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the Marian title of Our Lady of Atonement. HistoryLewis T. Wattson= Lewis Thomas Wattson was born in Millington, Maryland January 16, 1863 to the Reverend Joseph Newton Wattson and his wife, Mary Electa. Reverend Wattson, a former Presbyterian, was an Episcopalian minister. Lewis received his B.A. (1882) and his M.A. (1885) from St. Stephen's College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He was ordained to the diaconate in 1885, and by special dispensation, at the age of twenty-three, he was made a presbyter. Wattson was graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity from the General Theological Seminary in New York City in 1887. After serving for a time in Port Deposit, Maryland, he became a popular preacher in the New York and New Jersey area and became rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Kingston, New York. In 1891, he established the Church of the Holy Cross Church as a mission of St. John's, to serve working-class families living near the West Shore Railroad.Murphy, Patricia O'Reilly. Kingston, Arcadia Publishing, 2013, p. 67 Holy Cross had a more Anglo-Catholic tradition and a particular mission to the poor.\\"History\\", Holy Cross Church Rev. Wattson resigned the rectorship in Kingston to accept a position as superior of an Episcopal mission in Omaha.Allen, Hugh Anthony. \\"The Society of the Atonement\\", The Month, Vol. 128, 1916 =Lurana Mary White= Lurana White Lurana Mary White was born in New York City on April 12, 1870. On Oct. 17, 1894 she became a postulant in the Episcopal community of the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus in Albany, New York, where she made her vows on Sept. 25, 1896. That same year, White began corresponding with Rev. Wattson,\\"White, Lurana Mary\\", The Episcopal Church whom she had heard was \\"very High Church\\".Puglisi, S.A., James. \\"Historical Profile: Founder of the Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity\\", L'Osservatore Romano, April 2, 2008 Wattson was at the time the superior of a small community of Episcopal priests in Omaha. Both were part of the Anglo-Catholic Movement, also known as the Oxford Movement, which had developed in the Church of England in the early 19th century. Sister Lurana asked Father Wattson's help in finding an Episcopal community of religious which practised corporate poverty in the Catholic Franciscan tradition. Father Wattson was unaware of any such community, but began corresponding with her regarding his desire to see the Anglican and Catholic Churches reunited under the leadership of the Bishop of Rome. In October 1898, White and Wattson met at her family's home in Warwick, New York and made a spiritual covenant to form a new religious community with the aim of re-establishing Franciscan life in the Anglican Communion. (The name of the new community was inspired by a passage in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 5:11), which, in the King James Version of the Bible, speaks of the atonement Christians have received through Jesus. Wattson chose to interpret the word \\"atonement\\" in the literal sense of \\"at-one-ment,\\" out of his vision that his new community should have the aim of leading all Christians to unity (oneness) with one another.) To this end, Sister Lurana spent a year in training with the Society of the Sisters of Bethany in Clerkenwell, London. Before her return, she made a pilgrimage to Assisi. =St. John's in the Wilderness= Rev. Albert Zabriskie Gray, rector of St. Philip's Church in the Highlands in Garrison, New York, was already serving St. James' Chapel at Highlands and the Chemical Works on the border with Westchester when he erected the mission Chapel of St. John's in the Wilderness in the southeastern portion of the parish.Chorley, E. Clowes. History of St. Philip's church in the Highlands, New York. Edwin S. Gorham, 1912, p. 249((PD- notice}} In 1882, Gray left Garrison to take a position at Racine College. The chapel fell into disuse and disrepair, but the trustees of St. Philip's gave Sister Lurana leave to use it and a nearby farmhouse until a convent should be built. On December 15, 1898, Sister Lurana and two companions took up residence in the area of Garrison, New York, at a farmhouse near the abandoned chapel of St. John's-in-the-Wilderness. She named the place \\"Graymoor\\", combining the names of Rev. Gray, who had founded the chapel, with that of a Mr. Moore, who had been a generous supporter of its restoration. =Episcopalian establishment= Meanwhile Father Wattson had spent some time at the Anglican Monastery of the Order of the Holy Cross at Westminster, Missouri to gain some experience of religious life in community. Wattson joined the sisters in the spring of 1899 and took up residence in a paint/carpenter's shed about a mile distant.Lafort, remigius. \\"Sisters of the Atonement\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X, Vol. 2 (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.212 With the formal establishment of the Society of the Atonement, they embraced religious life in the Episcopal Church. In taking religious vows, Miss White became known as Mother Lurana, while Father Wattson took the name of Father Paul James Francis. Mother Lurana became head of the Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement, the women's branch of the society; Father Paul became superior of the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement. Frederick Joseph Kinsman, third Bishop of Delaware, was chosen as Episcopal Visitor. The Society preached the primacy of the Roman pontiff, while keeping its Episcopal allegiance, as they worked to realize a corporate reunion between the two bodies. Due to this, the founders and their small number of disciples came to find themselves not only criticised but ostracised by their co-religionists, who saw them as walking an impossible tightrope between the two bodies. Reception into the Catholic Church In 1909 both the men's and women's societies chose to seek union with the Holy See and full membership in the Catholic Church. In October 1909, the Vatican took the unprecedented step of accepting the members of the Society as a corporate body, allowing the Friars and Sisters to remain in their established way of life. Now in union with the Bishop of Rome, the Friars of the Atonement continued their work of advocating the reconciliation and eventual reunion of the various Christian denominations with the Pope as spiritual leader, known as ecumenism. A major part of this effort was the Octave of Christian Unity, an eight-day period of prayer for the various segments of Christianity. The Octave runs January 18-25, starting on the date that--at the time--marked the Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter at Rome, and ending on the Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul. This period is now known as the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity and is celebrated by many Christian denominations. Present- day activities The friars continue their focus on ecumenical work and church unity. In this many serve as resource people to dioceses throughout the world. Their motherhouse continues to be at Graymoor in the United States, but they have houses in Brazil, Canada, Italy, Japan, and the Philippines. One has closed in recent years in the United Kingdom. Founded as a preaching and missionary order, the Friars operate parishes in the United States and Canada, retreat and reconciliation ministries, chaplaincies, special ministry to alcoholics, and the kinds of direct service to the poor that Franciscans are normally engaged in. Atonement Website: Parishes The Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement have established catechetical and daycare centers all over North America, serving rural communities throughout the western United States and Canada, as well as inner city locales, such as Harlem in New York City. Several accompanied the Japanese-American communities they served into the forced resettlement conducted during World War II. Today, the Sisters serve in the United States, Canada, Italy, Japan, Brazil and the Philippines. In England the Friars used to run the Catholic Central Library (now known as the Catholic National Library), situated in the vicinities of Westminster Cathedral, London, before its move to the small town of Farnborough, Hampshire, southwest of London. Timothy Cardinal Dolan of the Archdiocese of New York formally opened the Cause for Canonization of Servant of God Father Paul of Graymoor on Tuesday, September 22, 2015 in New York City. The Father Paul of Graymoor Guild was established in 2016 as a central information source about the status of the cause for Father Paul of Graymoor's canonization. In March 2017, the diocesan phase of the process was closed, and Wattson's collected writings were forwarded to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.Pietrafesa, Dan. \\"Archdiocese Closes Cause for Atonement Society Founder\\", Catholic New York, March 15, 2017 The friars sponsor the Graymoor Ecumenical & Interreligious Institute, which has offices in the Interchurch Center at 475 Riverside Drive in New York. This institute publishes a monthly newsletter called Ecumenical Trends which is available by subscription in print and online forms.

He then attended California State University, Chico, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Visual Communication (photography, graphic design, and printing technology). During his college years Dale took over the editorship of a small newsletter about railroading in the western United States. During his tenure, CTC Board became a magazine with worldwide circulation. In 1995 the magazine was sold to Hundman Publishing of Edmonds, Washington. It was sold again to White River Productions in 2006. It is still in publication under the title Railroads Illustrated. Sanders extensively photographed the Western Pacific Railroad in California's Feather River Canyon, the Denver & Rio Grande Western throughout Colorado and Utah, U.S. Steel's Atlantic City Mine Railroad and most recently BC Rail in western Canada.

In the pages of Northern Light may be found all the elements that made BC Rail so interesting. From its locomotives (including steam, diesel, and electric) to its unique Budd RDC passenger operations, BC Rail was a railway like no other. Besides just machinery, BC Rail's right-of-way passed through some of the most beautiful and diverse scenery in North America. Perhaps the railway's most valuable feature were the railroaders who performed their assigned duties with professionalism and a passion for railroading. The photographs of the machines, landscapes, and people included in Northern Light tell the whole story of British Columbia's own railway.

He also served as the first President of the Nordic Council in 1953. Hedtoft was a Social Democrat, and had taken over the leadership of his party from Thorvald Stauning in 1939, but was forced by the Nazis to resign his posts in 1941 because he was too critical of the German occupation of Denmark. In September 1943, he was instrumental in starting the rescue of the Danish Jews. During his time as Prime Minister, progressive taxation was introduced, together with other reforms. The Public Assistance Act of April 1949 introduced special treatment and assistance (transferred from communal assistance or poor relief) for TB patients, while the law on measures for the deaf and dumb of January 1950 introduced special provisions for the deaf and partially deaf within the framework for the special care of handicapped persons. In addition, the Home Help Act of April 1949 obliged municipalities to operate home help services. After the failure to create a Scandinavian defence union, Denmark joined NATO in 1949. In October 1950 his government lost a vote on lifting the rationing of butter. Because this failure to get his policy through signalled that his party had lost its parliamentary support, new elections were called. Erik Eriksen from the Liberal Party was able to form the Cabinet of Erik Eriksen together with the Conservative People's Party on 30 October 1950. On 30 September 1953 Hedtoft was able to return as Prime Minister, and formed the Cabinet of Hans Hedtoft II, consisting only of the Social Democrats. He did not have the support of the Danish Social Liberal Party as they were unsatisfied with the large amount of resources allocated to the military because of Denmark's obligations to NATO. On 29 January 1955 Hedtoft died suddenly from a heart attack while in a meeting in the Nordic Council in Stockholm. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by his friend and Foreign Minister H. C. Hansen. The liner MS Hans Hedtoft was named after him. Hedtoft was married to Ella Gudrun Ingeborg Holleufer. She died in 1954 from Addison's disease, aged 48.

It is designed to be a minimalistic, high-quality CD ripper that would be able to compensate for and adjust to poor hardware to produce a flawless rip. libparanoia is a portable and platform independent library that was made from the important parts ripped from the Linux/gcc-only program cdparanoia. Libparanoia is part of cdrtools. Design libparanoia is the foundation of the project and does most of the work, whereas the application cdparanoia is merely an application frontend to libparanoia. The current stable release of the library is Paranoia III. The guiding principle of cdparanoia's design is \\"Too many features spoil the broth\\". cdparanoia is designed to rip correctly and know as much as possible about the CD-ROM hardware instead of implementing extraneous features such as a graphical user interface or a CDDB interface. Development history cdparanoia is developed by Xiph.org, the same team behind Vorbis and Theora, who provide public Subversion read-only access. The project began as a set of patches to cdda2wav, called Paranoia I and II that provided limited error correction and supported few drives. Paranoia III, (January 1998), was a standalone library for BeOS and Linux. Possible future Paranoia IV, the future development version, is announced to be more flexible, portable and capable. Planned features include parallel port drive support, pregap detection and removal, and NetBSD and Solaris ports. Development seemed to halt some time after 2002, with no public updates to the site and source code for several years, but resumed in August, 2006 Prerelease of Cdparanoia 10.0 with the prerelease of version 10.0. The current development version is still based on cdda2wav code from 1997 and thus does neither contain support for extracting meta data from audio CDs nor workarounds for typical logical defects in CDs that prevented audio extraction with old versions of cdda2wav (such as audio tracks that are marked as data tracks). As of 2019, none of this has happened. However CD-Paranoia support on other operating systems is available via libcdio and its port of cdparanoia. Status indicators One of the quirks of cdparanoia is that its ripping status is indicated by an emoticon. As per the cdparanoia manual, the following emoticons are used: :-) Normal operation, low/no jitter :- Normal operation, considerable jitter :-/ Read drift :-P Unreported loss of streaming in atomic read operation 8- Finding read problems at same point during re- read; hard to correct :-0 SCSI/ATAPI transport error :-( Scratch detected ;-( Gave up trying to perform a correction 8-X Aborted read due to known, uncorrectable error :^D Finished extracting See also * Compact disc digital audio * Cdrtools * cdrkit * Exact Audio Copy * Sound Juicer NotesExternal links * CDDA Paranoia Homepage * cdparanoia manual page * cdparanoia Hydrogenaudio page Category:Linux CD ripping software Category:Console CD ripping software Category:Xiph.Org projects ","title":"Cdparanoia"},{"id":"1629094","title":"Shoshana Bean"},{"id":"1629099","text":"Strand Theatre or Strand Theater may refer to:  Australia  * Strand Theatre, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia  England  * Royal Strand Theatre, London, demolished 1905 * Strand Theatre, London, called the Novello Theatre since 2005 United States * Strand Theatre, former movie house in Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, built in 1925 * Strand Theatre (San Francisco), reopening in 2015 now owned by American Conservatory Theatre, originally opened in 1917 and shuttered in 2003, in San Francisco, California * Strand Theatre (Jennings, Louisiana), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana * Strand Theatre (Shreveport, Louisiana), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Caddo Parish, Louisiana * Strand Theatre (Rockland, Maine), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Knox County, Maine * Strand Theatre, Brockton, Massachusetts, site of a fire that killed 13 firefighters in 1941 * Strand Theatre (Dorchester, Massachusetts), a restored vaudeville house located in Uphams Corner in Dorchester, Massachusetts * Strand Theater (Lexington, Mississippi), a Mississippi Landmark * Strand Theater (Louisville, Mississippi), a Mississippi Landmark * Strand Theater (Manchester, New Hampshire), theater portion destroyed by fire in 1985 * Strand Theatre (Lakewood, New Jersey), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Ocean County, New Jersey * Strand Theatre (Brooklyn), a former vaudeville house now home to BRIC Arts and UrbanGlass * Strand Theatre (Ithaca, New York), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Tompkins County, New York * Strand Theatre (Manhattan), demolished Broadway movie theatre opened in 1914 * Strand Theater (Plattsburgh, New York), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Clinton County, New York * Strand Theatre (Grafton, North Dakota), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Walsh County, North Dakota * Strand Theatre (Delaware, Ohio), movie theatre opened in 1916 * Strand Theater (Zelienople, Pennsylvania), a community theatre * Strand Theater (Washington, D.C.), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C. * Strand Theatre (Moundsville, West Virginia), home of the Wheeling Jamboree radio program * Strand Theater (Allentown, Pennsylvania), a former cinema in Allentown, Pennsylvania * Strand Theatre (Marietta, Georgia), a performing arts and film center in Marietta, Georgia, United States of America ","title":"Strand Theatre"},{"id":"1629105","text":"Father Alexis André (6 July 1832 - 10 January 1893) was a missionary Roman Catholic priest active in Western Canada.

Weiler of The New York Times wrote that if the film \\"is less than an overpowering study of a married couple driven to distraction by the irritations and indignities of local middle-class living, it still scores valid points, both serious and funny ... Mr. Simon is serious about a theme that isn't earth- shaking and he understandably cloaks its gravity with genuine chuckles that pop up mostly as radio news bulletins such as the flash that a Polish freighter has just run into the Statue of Liberty. And, with a cast whose members appreciate what they're saying and doing, the gnawing problems of 'Second Avenue' become a pleasure.\\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety wrote, \\"The film is more of a drama with comedy, for the personal problems as well as the environmental challenges aren't really funny, and even some of the humor is forced and strident ... maybe there have been too many films on the trials of urban existence to make yet another parade of big city woes laughable.\\"Murphy, Arthur D.

The basic conception of sangrita is to complement the flavor of 100% agave tequila, which is also peppery and citrusy in taste. Before increased worldwide popularity and corporate interest in tequila in the late 1990s and early 21st century, few outside of the Mexican Pacific region bordering the state of Jalisco, where tequila was mainly produced and consumed, knew of the existence of sangrita, and much less its recipe. As popularity grew, so did commercial efforts to recreate the mysterious red, spicy drink that was served with tequila. In fact the drink was not that mysterious. While most outsiders would reference its red make up as tomato juice and spices, locals and traditionalists agree that the one ingredient that most likely doesn't belong is tomato. A popular recipe in Guadalajara (Jalisco's largest city) was said to have originated from the leftover juices (mainly orange) of an equally popular regional fruit salad covered with fine chilli powder, usually piquin. As the fruit salad, known to jalisquillos (Guadalajara's natives) as pico de gallo, was consumed from a large bowl during breakfast, the remaining juice was saved and poured on a small and narrow clay cup, which itself would be the precursor of the tequila shot glass. In essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice. The key to a balanced sangrita recipe can be found in the fruit salad's recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama. Traditionally, sangrita is served with tequila blanco, but it can also accompany tequila reposado. The tequila and sangrita are each poured into a separate shot glass (or caballito) and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. Sangrita is used in a drink known as \\"The Mexican Flag\\", where three separate double shot glasses are filled with lime juice, tequila and sangrita. Ingredients Authentic sangrita from the Lake Chapala region of Jalisco is made with Seville orange, lime and pomegranate juices, with chili powder or hot sauce added for heat. However, most modern sangrita recipes (particularly outside of Jalisco) have mistakenly attributed the red appearance of the drink to tomato juice instead of the chile powder. While some would argue that there is no set rule on what sangrita should contain, as the main ingredient, it is commonly considered by older residents of Jalisco that tomato and particularly branded recipes such as the \\"Clamato\\" mix stem from uninformed efforts to recreate the drink due to its growing popularity. It can feature a blend of orange, lime, tomato and/or pomegranate juices, or pomegranate-based grenadine with the addition of something spicy (hot sauce or fresh/dried Chili pepper), and sometimes white onion and salt. A variation on a basic traditional recipe: * 1 oz. freshly squeezed orange juice * 3/4 to 1 oz. freshly squeezed lime juice * 1/2 oz. real pomegranate-based grenadine * 1/4 tsp. ancho chile powder or 3 dashes hot sauce * 1-2 slices jalapeño A basic tomato based recipe (non-traditional) * 2 parts freshly squeezed tomato juice * 1 part freshly squeezed orange juice * 1/2 part freshly squeezed lime juice * Fresh minced green chile to taste Mexico City style Sangrita: * 5 parts tomato juice * 2 parts fresh lime juice * 1 part orange juice * Seasoned with a combination of Jugo Maggi, Salsa Valentina, Worcestershire and Tabasco(original) sauce to taste.

Active in most European countries, it seeks to promote European integration through the strengthening and democratisation of the European Union (EU). JEF has close ties to the European Movement and the Union of European Federalists and is a full member of the European Youth Forum (YFJ). Former activists of JEF can join the alumni association, Friends of JEF. History First founded in the late 1940s, the now existing European level structure of the JEF was founded in the 1970s. It was around the 1950s that the first groups of young federalists appeared as a youth section of the Union of European Federalists. The Young European Federalists organized themselves into JEF sections, establishing a new European structure with a European office in Paris in 1949. Despite the split within the federalist movement in the 1950s, the various JEF groups carried on with their work on local, regional and national levels even if there was no more any international JEF organization. In 1967, young people held mock negotiations in Brussels to work out a treaty of accession for the UK to the Community. In March 1969 they organized a demonstration on the spectators benches of the European Parliament, demanding its direct elections by universal suffrage. In many European countries protest demonstrations were organized against the dictatorship in Greece. These activities helped the first groups of young federalists to set up very close collaboration and to tighten their links again. This collaboration took concrete form in the creation of JEF’s liaison office in 1970. It was there that the international association took the name of ‘Young European Federalists' and the founding Congress was held in Luxembourg on 25 and 26 March 1972. Even though JEF was still interested in the European Community, new topics became increasingly important for JEF in the 70’s: direct election of the European Parliament, East-West reunification and enlargement, disarmament, women, the environment and international development issues. In 1985, when Jacques Delors became President of the European Commission and launched the idea of the Single Market, institutional questions became important in the discussion in JEF since it seemed that a real European Democracy can be established in a short time and JEF said of itself: Young Europeans, simply a generation ahead, which is still the JEF motto nowadays. In the 90s three basic developments influenced the work and the discussions of JEF: # the return of nationalist wars in Europe; # the crisis of legitimacy of the European integration process, highlighted by the Danish referendum in 1992, the lost Norwegian referendum in 1994 and the negative attitude of a majority of EU citizens towards the Euro; # the open questions on the enlargement of the European Union. Since the 2000s, JEF Europe has worked a lot on institutional issues calling for a European federal constitution and a more democratic Europe. Another major area of interest for JEF is the defense of human rights and the respect of the state of law especially with a yearly Belarus action since 2006. Goals According to its statutes, JEF is a non-partisan and non-denominational European NGO. It advocates for a united Europe with a federal structure. At the centre of JEF's political program is the demand for a federal constitution for Europe, whose core element is a two-chamber Parliament (consisting of a directly elected chamber and a chamber of states). Hereby, JEF insists on the subsidiarity principle as a form of decentralized distribution of powers. Another key element is the demand for a unified foreign and security policy of the European Union. JEF is committed to comprehensive reform of the EU towards more democracy, participation, transparency, efficiency and sustainability. In addition to the policy objectives, the organisation tries in particular to promote European awareness among young people and encourage civic activism. Activities JEF spreads its ideas by the following means: :Campaigns to lobby over a longer period of time for a specific federalist cause. :Street actions mobilising the entire network to raise awareness of burning European issues among the general public. (Most notably the annual Free Belarus street action, taking place in numerous cities Europe- and worldwide since 2006) :International events such as seminars and trainings on a wide range of topics in different EU and non-EU countries. :A multilingual, interactive webzine thenewfederalist where youth can voice their opinion in articles on current European affairs. :Projects that implement a specific goal and for which specific funding was received. :Press releases for the advocacy of JEF's objectives towards both public and private organisations. Consequently, the organisation encourages debate on European affairs and EU policies while fostering youth mobility and exchanges throughout the continent, thus seeking to involve European Citizens, in particular young people, from all across the continent in the process of European integration. Organisation JEF has about 15,000 members in 31 widely autonomous national sections, which are coordinated by a European umbrella organisation, JEF Europe.http://www.jef.eu JEF Europe JEF Europe is an International association without lucrative purpose (IVZW/AISBL) under Belgian law. The European Secretariat is based in Brussels. =The European Congress= The highest decision-making body of JEF is the European Congress, which meets every two years in a different city. The delegates are elected by the members of national sections or their representatives in proportion to the number of members of each section.

It is housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.Ingo F. Walther, Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1, Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening. Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering, sun-dappled light. From 1879 to 1894 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Musée du Louvre until it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986. Smaller version Smaller version Renoir painted a smaller version of the picture (78 × 114 cm) with the same title. The painting is now believed to be in a private collection in Switzerland. Apart from their size, the two paintings are virtually identical, although the smaller is painted in a more fluid manner than the d'Orsay version. One is presumably a copy of the original, but it is not known which is the original. It is not even known which was the one first exhibited at the 3rd Impressionist exhibition of 1877, because although the painting was catalogued and given favourable attention by critics, its entry did not indicate the size of the painting, information that would serve to identify it. For many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold the painting for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City to Ryoei Saito (Saitō Ryōei), the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, Japan. At the time of sale, it was one of the top two most expensive artworks ever sold, together with van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was also purchased by Saito. Saito caused international outrage when he suggested in 1991 that he intended to cremate both paintings with him when he died. However, when Saito and his companies ran into severe financial difficulties, bankers who held the painting as collateral for loans arranged a confidential sale through Sotheby's to an undisclosed buyer.Kleiner, Carolyn. \\"Van Gogh's vanishing act.\\" \\"Mysteries of History\\". US News & World Report. 24 July 2000. Web. Retrieved 26 March 2012. Although not known for certain, the painting is believed to be in the hands of a Swiss collector. the smaller version of the Bal du moulin de la Galette is sixth (when adjusted for the consumer price index) on the list of most expensive paintings ever sold.  Genesis  La balançoire, 1876 Renoir conceived his project of painting the dancing at Le Moulin de la Galette in May 1876 and its execution is described in full by his civil servant friend Georges Rivière in his memoir Renoir et ses amis. In the first place, Renoir needed to set up a studio near the mill. A suitable studio was found at an abandoned cottage in the rue Cortot with a garden described by Rivière as a \\"beautiful abandoned park\\". Several of Renoir's major works were painted in this garden at this time, including La balançoire (The Swing). The gardens and its buildings have been preserved as the Musée de Montmartre. Rivière identified several of the personalities in the painting. Despite Renoir's resource of distributing a sought after fashionable hat of the time amongst his models (the straw bonnet with a wide red ribbon top right is an example of this hat, called a timbale), he was unable to persuade his favourite sixteen-year-old model Jeanne Samary, who appears in La balançoire, to pose as principal for the painting (in fact she was conducting an affair with a local boy at the time). It is her sister Estelle who poses as the girl wearing a blue and pink striped dress. These two girls came to Le Moulin every Sunday with their family; with two younger sisters barely taller than the tables, and their mother and father, properly chaperoned by their mother (entry was free for girls at Le Moulin and not all were models of virtue). Beside her is a group consisting of Pierre-Franc Lamy and Norbert Goeneutte (also appearing in La balançoire), fellow painters, as well as Rivière himself. Behind her, amongst the dancers, are to be found Henri Gervex, Eugène Pierre Lestringuez and Paul Lhote (who appears in Dance in the Country). In the middle distance, in the middle of the dance hall, the Cuban painter Don Pedro Vidal de Solares y Cardenas is depicted in striped trousers dancing with the model called Margot (Marguerite Legrand). Apparently the exuberant Margot found Solares too reserved and was endeavouring to loosen him up by dancing polkas with him and teaching him dubious songs in the local slang. She was to die of typhoid just two years later, Renoir nursing her until the end, paying both for her treatment and her funeral. Rivière describes the painting as executed on the spot and that not without difficulty as the wind constantly threatened to blow the canvas away. This has led some critics to speculate that it was the larger d'Orsay painting that was painted here, as the smaller would have been easier to control. On the other hand, the smaller is much the more spontaneous and freely worked of the two, characteristic of en plein air work.

The Hūlun alliance was formed by Wan (d. 1582), the leader of the Hada tribal federation, which had drawn its importance from the control of commerce between the late-Ming Liaodong and Jurchen tribes to the east via Guangshun Pass (east of Kaiyuan, which is located near the northern tip of today's Liaoning Province). Besides the Hada themselves, the Hūlun included three other tribal federations, known as Ula, Yehe, and Hoifa. While the Hūlun people were mostly of Jurchen origin, they had been heavily influenced by the Mongol language and culture, and intermarried with the neighboring Khorchin and Kharchin Mongols. Therefore, were viewed by their southern neighbors – Jianzhou Jurchens, which were in the late 16th century led by Nurhaci – as Monggo (\\"Mongols\\"). The Hūlun's khan Wan aspired to paramount leadership in the region, establishing a network of political and business relations with Jurchen and Mongol leaders, as well as with the Ming governor of Liaodong, Li Chengliang. Nurhaci, the chief of Jianzhou Jurchens, was Wan's son-in-law,Of course, the Jurchen and Mongol chieftains of the time being polygamous, it would be common for each of them to be a son-in-law, and later in life father-in-law, of many other chiefs; see many allusions to such relations elsewhere in Crossley (2006). and, in Pamela Crossley's view, viewed Wan and his Hūlun as role models for himself and his (Late) Jin Empire. Many years later, long after Hong Taiji had renamed Jurchens to Manchus, and both Wan and Nurhaci were dead, Qing historians referred to Wan as one of the first great leaders of the \\"Manchu nations\\". In the closing years of the 16th century, Hūlun tribes started recognizing Nurhaci's supremacy although, in some cases, the Nurhaci-appointed chief of a tribe would then try to assert his independence, and a new war would result, as it was the case with Bujantai, the leader of the Ula. Eventually, all four tribes were fully incorporated into Nurhaci's empire (Hada 1601, Hoifa 1607, Ula 1613, Yehe 1619).

He established the War Office as a department of the British Government and played an important part in administering the English (later British) colonies of North America. Life Blaythwayt was baptized in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London on 2 March 1649, the only son of William Blathwayt, barrister, of the Middle Temple, and his wife Anne Povey, daughter of Justinian Povey of Hounslow, Middlesex, who was accountant-general to Queen Anne of Denmark. He was born to a well-to-do family of Protestant merchants and lawyers. In 1665 he was admitted at Middle Temple. Blaythwayt joined the diplomatic service in 1668 when his uncle Thomas Povey, an influential London lawyer, found him a post as Clerk of the English embassy at The Hague. He followed this in 1672 with a year as Clerk of Embassy at Copenhagen and Stockholm. From 1672 to 1673 he travelled in Sweden, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France and in the course of his tour, he studied at Padua University. Blaythwayt returned to London in the early 1670s, and was assistant secretary of trade and plantations from 1675 to 1679. He became a Clerk of the Privy Council in Extraordinary in 1678 and in 1679 was promoted to secretary of trade and plantations. Also in 1679, he was considered \\"as a very fit person\\" to be assistant to the secretary of the council, being heavily involved in the administration of England's colonies in North America. In 1680, he became the first surveyor and auditor- general of royal revenues in America. He became under-secretary of state (north) in 1681 until he obtained by purchase in 1683 the office of Secretary at War which he held to February 1689. His role as Secretary at War was originally merely the role of secretary to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army but under Blathwayt the remit of the Secretary was greatly expanded to encompass all areas of Army administration. He effectively established the War Office as a department of the government, although he had very little input into the actual conduct of wars. Issues of strategic policy during wartime were managed by the Northern and Southern Departments (the predecessors of today's Foreign Office and Home Office respectively). At the 1685 English general election Blathwayt was returned as Member of Parliament for Newtown on the government interest. He was not active the Parliament, and was appointed to only one committee to examine the disbandment accounts. In October 1686, Blaythwayt became a Clerk of the Privy Council in Ordinary. He became the secretary of the Privy Council's committee on trade and foreign plantations — in effect, colonial under-secretary. It was in this capacity that he became a key figure in American affairs. He was responsible for establishing the charter of the Crown colony of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the predecessor of the state of Massachusetts. He did much to promote trade in America and the Caribbean, promoting the slave trade and benefiting considerably from gifts and bribes received in connection with his office (as was the usual practice in his day). His rise was noted by many of his contemporaries; the diarist John Evelyn commended him as \\"very dexterous in business\\" and as one who had \\"raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.\\" On 23 December 1686, he married Mary Wynter, daughter of John Wynter of Dyrham Park. Blaythwayt was a witness for the prosecution at the Trial of the Seven Bishops in 1688 and he lost the politically sensitive post as secretary at war after the Glorious Revolution. He was restored to the post in May 1689 and held it to 1704. Blaythwayt was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Bath in 1693 and held the seat until 1710. He was appointed Lord of Trade in 1696, holding the post until 1707. Dyrham Park Blathwayt retired to Dyrham in 1710 (his wife had died in 1691).

The beginning of his kingship saw a revival in the ancient form of inauguration performed for the Kings of Connacht after a period of apparent lapse in the practice. His reign took place against the background of a Gaelic recovery following the Anglo-Norman invasion and the disputed High Kingship of Edwurd Bruce. He was the last King of Connacht to truly hold power over the entire province and his death halted the gains that had been made following the Anglo Norman invasion, by his kingdom. His foster father Maelruanid Mac Diarmata King of Magh Luirg would play an instrumental role in his reign. Feidhlimid was killed at the Second Battle of Athenry at the head of a massive Irish army thought to comprise at least two and a half thousand men, mainly from Connacht, with allies from Munster, Breifne, Mide and Ulster. A son, Aedh mac Felim Ó Conchobair, would later become King of Connacht, as would his grandson, Tairdelbach mac Aedh Ua Conchobair.  Life and Reign  His father, Aedh Ó Conchobair, was killed in battle at Coill an Clochain by Aed Breifnech Ua Conchobair. Afterwards the 'three tuatha', that is three sub kingdoms of Connacht, submitted to Aed Breifnach. However Maelruanid Mac Diarmata King of Magh Luirg marched with Feidhlimid, his foster son, to Sil Murray with an army to ensure that any agreements Aed Breifnach made with the chieftains and sub kings of Connacht would not be ratified. Instead this show of strength by his foster father ensured Sil Murray and its chieftains submitted to Feidhlimid, and they allied themselves with William Burke of the Hiberno-Norman Burke dynasty. Aed Breifnach retaliated the next year in the 'Raid of the Burning' on Clogher killing many of Mac Diarmata's kin including women and children. Feidhlimid's problems with Aed Breifnach would come to an abrupt end soon after however when he was killed by a mercenary captain serving him named Seonac Mac Uidili in a plot organised by William Burke. On news of his demise Burke and Mac Diarmata retaliated against those who had supported Aed with raids across Connacht. A rift however soon developed between the former allies with William Burke enforcing over lordship over Sil Murray by billeting his forces throughout the country. It was in response to this in 1310 that Feidhlimid was installed as King of Connacht with the backing of his foster father as explained by the Annals of Connacht, Maelruanaid Mac Diarmata, seeing the exclusion of his foster-son from his patrimony and the heavy exactions on each tuath about him, and much resenting the action of the Galls (Burke) in restricting and diminishing his power—for the Galls felt sure that if this one man were weak the whole province of Connacht would be in their own hands—determined, like the warrior he was, to take his foster-son boldly and make him king by force. The next we hear of Feidhlimid is in 1311 when he makes a raid on his rivals the Clan Murtagh killing several. In 1315 Feidhlimid was marching in Richard Og de Burgh, the 2nd Earl of Ulster's army against Edwurd Bruce's forces in Ulster ravaging the land as they went. Edwurd Bruce then secretly sent messengers to Feidhlimid offering him all of the ancient kingdom of Connacht undivided if he would recognize Bruce as High King of Ireland and fight beside him, to which Feidhlimid agreed. It was at this time that Ruaidri son of Cathal Ruad O Conchobair a rival claimant to Feidhlimid also approached Bruce submitting to him and promising that he would drive the English from Connacht, which Bruce consented to provided Ruaidri refrained from attacking Feidhlimid. Ruaidhri however, having plundered many of the English possessions in Connacht had himself installed as King demanding Mac Diarmata recognize him, which was refused. Feidhlimid on hearing this hurried back to Connacht being attacked the whole way by allies of Ruaidri until his company was defeated somewhere in modern county Longford. After this defeat Feidhlimid appears crestfallen dismissing the chieftains and sub kings who still followed him and advising they submit to Ruaidri rather than lose their positions with him. He returned to his former ally William Burke hoping for his support but Burke instead sought peace with Ruaidri in order to recover his lands in Connacht. He instead teamed up with some kinsmen who had been raiding against the Clan Murtagh and his foster father Mac Diarmata killed Conchobar Ruad son of Aed Brefnech and carried great plunder back to Feidhlimid at Leyney. Soon after they were forced to flee when Ruaidri lead an army against them and had his ally Diarmait Gall Mac Diarmata installed as king of Magh Luirg in opposition to Feidhlimid's foster father. Looking for allies they submitted to the English of West Connacht and in the following year with their support they marched on Ruaidri and defeated him at the Battle of Tochar killing both him and Diarmait Gall, with Maelruanid Mac Diarmata being wounded in the fighting. Feidhlimid afterwards recovered his kingship and turned on his former allies the English of West Connacht killing many knights, and rallying a large army consisting of his own forces from Connacht as well as armies from the Kingdoms of Thomond, Breifne and Meath to oppose William Burke and the other Galls (foreigners) of Connacht. They meet at the Second Battle of Athenry where the Irish forces were defeated and Feidhlimid killed, being at the time only twenty three and described in the Annals of Connacht as entitled to become King of Ireland.  Aftermath of Death  He was succeeded by Ruaidri na Fed son of Ruaidri O Conchobair, who was later deposed by Mac Diarmata after a reign of only a quarter of a year. Wiliam Burke followed up his victory by gaining submission of all the lords of Sil Muray, save Mac Diarmata who would be as active as ever in the kingship of Connacht until his death in 1322. None of Feidhlimid's decedents would be able to wield power comparable to that of Feidhlimid or his predecessors and the Kingship of Connacht become a more symbolic title as the land and resources of the Kings waned as their vassals power increased.  Inauguration  The Annals of Connacht, in there entry for 1310 of Feidhlimid's inauguration, imply it was the first time in many years that the traditional rite of inauguration for a King of Connacht was carried out. The reason for this is believed to stem from the Norman invasion of Ireland and the political decline of the Irish kingdoms. Feidhlimid's inauguration, then, can be seen to be a symptom of the Gaelic recovery underway in the time of his reign and a throwback to times where his predecessors wielded power throughout the island of Ireland. The entry itself states: and he, Fedlimid mac Aeda meic Eogain, was proclaimed in a style as royal, as lordly and as public as any of his race from the time of Brian son of Eochu Muigmedoin till that day. And when Fedlimid mac Aeda meic Eogain had married the Province of Connacht his foster- father waited upon him during the night in the manner remembered by the old men and recorded in the old books; and this was the most splendid kingship- marriage ever celebrated in Connacht down to that day. The wording hear clearly implies a symbolic marriage between Feidhlimid and the Kingdom of Connacht. This can be seen as tying into the concept of sacral kingship for the early Irish period and the idea of the sovereignty goddess with the land as a woman whom, when the rightful King marries her, brings fertility and bounty. However the fact that the annalist also mentions the old 'remembered' nature of the ceremony could imply this was how Feidhlimid and his contemporaries saw the ceremony in 1310, rather than it being outright evidence of the kings inauguration as a sacred marriage between him and the land being the Irish norm. The throwback nature of the inauguration implies Feidhlimid and his supporters were hearkening back to the past for legitimacy with this inauguration after the long lapse in the kingship prior to his accession.

His work was then spread through the World Health Organization (WHO) to the rest of the world. Tierkel came to be known as “Dr. Rabies”. Early lifeFamily= His father David Baer Tierkel and his mother Esther Ginsberg Tierkel ensured that their children had all of the strong values that they had brought with them as Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. Tierkel's father and his family arrived at Ellis Island in the United States on August 1, 1893 on the German ship Meier after a long immigration from the small village of Moliv, in the Ukraine. Tierkel's grandfather, Fischel Tierkel, made the decision that the continued violence against the Jews in the Ukraine was not sustainable for raising his family. It was then with his wife Rachel, son David, and daughters Lura, Emma, and Ethel set off for a better life. They tried Heidelberg, Germany for a few years, where David, the eldest child, enrolled in the University, but found that Jews were not as welcome in Germany either. The family then set off for the land of opportunity, The United States. After arriving at Ellis Island on a hot August day in 1893, the Tierkel family eventually settled in Philadelphia, where a large Eastern-European Jewish population was thriving. Tierkel's childhood was driven by a set of values that prioritized education and intellectual pursuit in the Talmudic tradition. Service to the greater society was stressed at all levels of life. Tierkel's father, David, was an author of a number of books, essays, articles, and plays. His father was a tireless advocate for worldwide Zionism as well as a member of a number of scientific institutes. As David B. Tierkel worked to become editor and publisher of a number newspapers in Philadelphia, Ernest Tierkel was surrounded by a focus on academics, poetry, history, and community service. Tierkel's brother Arnold was an accomplished artist, having attended the Philadelphia School of Art and studying in Italy after the war. Both Tierkel and his sister Doris attended and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. Tierkel's mother was a steady hand in running the family business, taking charge of the family newspaper after the death of Tierkel's father in 1948. The children in the house would help publish their newspaper, helping with the typesetting and eventually contributing writing and editing on a wide and varied array of subjects. This environment gave Tierkel his love of science; of theater; of history; of community; and of Zionism. Many a night were spent at the theater or the opera, using the free tickets that came to the newspaper's offices. But it was not all work at the Tierkel household. During the summers, Esther and the children would spend time in Atlantic City, building sand castles, strolling on the boardwalk, and enjoying the big bands on Atlantic City Pier. This would instill a great love of the ocean in Tierkel for the rest of his life that he would pass on to his children. The family's network of friends that they established were from many varied walks of life, giving the children a great view into many cultures. Tierkel's mother was a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. =Education= This exposure to the wide culture of the world set the foundation for Tierkel's later life. It gave him the drive and passion to learn all that he could about the world around him. Tierkel was a serious student and took advantage of the great public school system of Philadelphia and graduated with honors in June 1930 from the Horace Binney School and then in 1934 from the acclaimed Central High School (Philadelphia). An early example of his service was as chairman of the Student Patrol at Central High School. It was not until his university experience at the University of Pennsylvania, out from under the strict nature of home, that Tierkel began to travel and broaden his life pursuits. Before graduating from Penn with his Bachelor of Arts in 1938, he spent a semester at the University of Virginia and gained his love of southern hospitality and culture – which was to play an important role in Tierkel's life. Tierkel then continued on to the medical school at University of Pennsylvania and to receive his V.M.D. in 1942. Tierkel continued his education in public health at Columbia University in New York City, where he was awarded his master's degree in Public Health in 1945. EpidemiologyUSDA= Having spent the majority of his life in Philadelphia, growing up, attending college and medical school, Tierkel was then attracted to New York City, where he joined the Department of Agriculture Bureau of Animal Industry as a Public Health Veterinarian Pathologist. Tierkel found a bachelor's apartment in New York City with his childhood friend Dr. Ernest Witt, with whom he had attended to high school, university, and medical school. He found during his tenure at the Department of Agriculture that there was a great deal of opportunity to solve many public health issues in this country. It was his USDA role that convinced Tierkel of these opportunities. While at the Department of Agriculture, Tierkel saw that as a public health advocate and scientist he could have a great impact on the world. With this in mind he attended Columbia University and received his master's degree in Public Health in 1945 while still working at the USDA. =Public Health Service= While attending a conference on animal health at the New York Academy of Science, Tierkel met Dr. Jim Steele. These future great friends hit it off immediately. It was Jim Steele who convinced Tierkel that the best place to effect change in public health in the United States was the United States Public Health Service. With Jim's advice in mind, upon graduation from Columbia, Tierkel sought and received an appointment as a scientist with the U.S. Public Health Service. Once his appointment as a scientist to the PHS came, Tierkel was off on his first assignment, back in his beloved south, Richmond, Virginia. While stationed in Richmond, Tierkel spent time traveling to Washington, D.C. It was at a dinner at Joe and Amy Dean's house that he met many of the other scientists who had come into the PHS that year, Art Wolf, Ray Pagan, Ray Helvig, Ted Price, and Oscar Sussman. Tierkel was then quickly appointed as the officer-in-charge of the rabies unit at the CDC Virus lab in Montgomery, Alabama. This was the beginning of a lifelong productive career in implementing vaccines and programs that would eliminate rabies as a major public health concern in the United States. His work was then spread through the WHO to the rest of the world. Indeed, Tierkel came to be known as “Dr. Rabies”. =Dr. Rabies= In the summer of 1946 Tierkel applied to the USPHS for appointment as a scientist and came to Washington. Tierkel then went to Montgomery, Alabama when he found out that the Rockefeller Rabies Laboratory was available. Tierkel was the first CDC'er on the scene. There they followed through on evaluating the new chicken embryo rabies vaccine, which set the basis for rabies control in the U.S. and later through MHO to the world. Tierkel's basic work with Martha Edson and Bob Kissling is a milestone and shall remain the basis of rabies control. Later the same evaluation was to be made of polio vaccine based on the same methods. And the polio vaccination disease of 1956 had its precedent in the failure of ether 'Killed* rabies vaccine, which Tierkel explained to David Price and the Washington investigators. In 1946 there were 10,000 cases of canine rabies every year reported in the United States. By 1975 there were only 129 cases of canine rabies reported in the United States. This dramatic success was due to the immunization program that resulted from Tierkel's work. The work on rabies that Tierkel led to a national program, which, within a few years, resulted in the elimination of urban rabies as a major public health problem in the United States. Where several thousand humans died each year from this dread disease, the toll eventually fell to just a few cases, and even zero in some years. It was during this period that Tierkel became internationally recognized. The principles he developed began to be applied in other countries, and many deaths were prevented there too. He became known as \\"Mr. Rabies,\\" but he went on to make contributions in other fields of communicable disease control through the Agency for International Development. =World health community= Tierkel spent a great deal of time as a member of the international health community. His love of different cultures allowed him to enjoy every assignment that brought him to new and varied landscapes. Whether it was Geneva, working with the WHO on global rabies control, or New Delhi, where he spent 3 years working with AID on communicable disease control and zoonoses, Tierkel savored the world around him. As a frequent speaker at Harvard University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, Emory University, and the University of Georgia, Tierkel was able to pass his knowledge on to others. Additionally Tierkel's work was widely published in over 50 times. Tierkel capped his career when he was appointed assistant surgeon general in 1968. =Assistant surgeon general= He put a capstone on his PHS career when he was promoted to the rank of assistant surgeon general and given very broad responsibilities as director of the Office of Science and a special assistant to the assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. As an additional responsibility, he also became the PHS chief veterinary officer upon the retirement of his old friend and mentor, Jim Steele. =Retirement from The Public Health Service= Tierkel retired from the PSPHS on March 29, 1973, but not from active professional life. Upon retirement from the PHS, Tierkel settled his family in the rural state of Delaware, not far from his roots in Washington, D.C. There he was able to reconnect with public health at a local level as Director of the Bureau of Disease Control and Chief Epidemiologist for the State of Delaware. It was this that he enjoyed most, dealing with the public health problems of everyday people, instituting programs that had benefit for the people that surrounded him. It was his love of life that always made him happy. =Chief epidemiologist for the State of Delaware= In Delaware Tierkel was able to focus on a wide array of public health issues ranging from rubella to swine flu to Legionnaire's Disease to TB to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever to lead poisoning. Tierkel's hallmark in these years was in instituting programs that utilized effective communication with the citizenry as well as well-structure programs to reduce mortality. Tierkel spent tireless hours working with the legislature on funding for new health programs that improved the quality of life in Delaware immeasurably. The impact of Ernest S. Tierkel's career resulted in the prevention of much suffering and many deaths. How pleasant it must have been for him to have realized his ambitions! Tierkel wanted to make the world a better place in which to live. And he did so, not only for those of us whose lives he touched directly, but also for the millions whom he touched indirectly. Tierkel was a fortunate man. He had the kind of life he wanted. Personal life In between all of this passionate pursuit of science, Tierkel found time for other passions, most notably the love of his life Ruby Reams Tierkel. Tierkel met Ruby at the officer's club at Ft. McPherson in Atlanta, where they were both living. Tierkel asked Ruby if he might call on her for dinner some time and she said, “of course”. Tierkel called one Sunday afternoon and asked Ruby out for dinner that night with Ruby replying, “Are you kidding? Tonight? The next time you call, please have the courtesy to plan ahead!”. Not to be deterred, Tierkel, who was off to Europe for a WHO meeting the next day, sent Ruby a telegram from Geneva, asking if she might select a suitable evening that she was free for them to have dinner. Having been smitten, Tierkel continued to pursue Ruby, which culminated in their being married on July 13, 1958. The world-traveling bachelor now entered a new phase of his love of life – family man. Tierkel treasured becoming a father to his new stepson, Mike Steele, Ruby's son from a previous marriage. Soon Tierkel and Ruby had another son, whom they named after Tierkel's father, David Baer Tierkel. The family was tight-knit and inherited many of values that their parents brought to them. Mike went on to attend the Citadel and followed a distinguished career in the U.S. Army, retiring as a lieutenant general. Mike and his wife Pam and their two children Lara and Cari were a bright light in Tierkel's life. He treasured the time that he was able to spend with his grandchildren. David went on to Boston University and followed a career in software technology as an entrepreneur helping to found several successful companies. David's wife Alison and children Chaya and Ezekiel live in Amherst, Massachusetts and continue to talk about their grandfather and his strong sense of life. One of the great foundations that his parents gave to Tierkel was his love of life, which combined with his intellectual upbringing spurred his interest in public health. Tierkel's entire career and life was dedicated to making the world a better place in which people could live and realize their dreams. Influences There were many people who influenced Tierkel's path into public health. Certainly Tierkel's parents, who stressed public service with an intellectual bent provided a lifelong foundation for Tierkel's efforts. His old childhood friend Ernie Witt, with whom he attended elementary, high school, university, and medical school had a great influence on entering the veterinary area. Most of all, though it was James H. Steele, who served as a mentor and guide throughout Tierkel's career from his induction to the officer corps of the Public Health Service through his retirement as Assistant Surgeon General. Another close colleague of Tierkel was Joe Held, a CDC’er and PHS scientist for whom Tierkel had great respect.

It had a variety of responsibilities, including domestic and Irish policy, colonial policy and foreign affairs concerning southern European powers such as France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Italy, Greece and the Ottoman Empire. It was administered by the Secretary of State for the Southern Department. The Southern Department's opposite number within government was the Northern Department, responsible for government dealings in northern Europe. In 1782, the Northern and Southern Departments were reorganized, with the Foreign Office taking over their foreign affairs responsibilities and Home Office taking over their domestic, military affairs, and colonial responsibilities.

The economy is mostly based on agriculture, although, starting from the 1970s, industry has played an increasingly important role. City gate. History Ardea is one of the most ancient towns in western Europe, founded during the 8th century BC. According to tradition it was the capital of the Rutuli, and it is described as such in the Aeneid. In 509 BC Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the king of Rome sought unsuccessfully to take the town by storm, and then commenced a siege of the town. However the siege was interrupted by the revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the king and the establishment of the Roman republic. One of the leaders of the revolution, Lucius Junius Brutus, came to the camp of the Roman army at Ardea and won the army's support for the revolution. In 443 BC the Volscians laid siege to Ardea. The siege was soon broken by Roman troops under the leadership of Marcus Geganius Macerinus. After the Roman conquest, Ardea was most often mentioned in connection with the Via Ardeatina, one of the consular roads, to which it gave its name. During the Second Punic War, it was one of the few cities that refused military support to Rome, and, after the Roman victory, was deprived of its autonomy. In the 3rd-2nd centuries BC it decayed until, in the Imperial Age, it was scarcely populated at all. The 1st century agricultural writer Columella possessed estates there. A view of the ancient agger After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ardea was abandoned. It returned to grow only after the 9th century AD. Its castle in 1118 housed Pope Gelasius II and was later contended among various feudal barons of the area. In 1419 Pope Martin V assigned it to his kinsmen, the Colonna family, who sold it in 1564 to the Cesarini. In 1816 it became a frazione of Genzano. Starting from 1932, the surrounding area was drained and Ardea began to flourish again, becoming a frazione of Pomezia starting from its foundation around 1948 and an independent municipality in 1970. Main sights Remains of the ancient city include the old defensive agger, dating to the 7th century BC and later (4th century BC) updated to larger walls. Archaeological excavations have brought to light four temples, of unknown dedication. Part of the pavement of a basilica (c. 100 BC) have also been found in the area of the ancient Forum. Other sights include: *The Church of Santa Marina, erected in 1191 by Cencio Savelli, the future Pope Honorius III. The interior, on a single nave, was originally entirely frescoed. *Romanesque Church of San Pietro Apostolo (12th century), which was a possession of the monks of San Paolo Fuori le Mura of Rome. It incorporates a former watchtower used to counter Saracen attacks, now turned into a bell tower. It has 15th-century frescoes and a 16th-century wooden crucifix. *The Giardini della Landriana, designed by Russell Page. *Giacomo Manzù Museum, housing some 400 works of the artist. *Tor San Lorenzo, a tower in the eponymous seaside frazione.

Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago. The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later. Japan is situated in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. Frequent low intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunamis, occur several times per century. The most recent major quakes include the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake and the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. Hot springs are numerous and have been developed as resorts. The geological features and bedrock composition of the Japanese main islands Geological historyOrogeny phase= Japanese archipelago relief (including submerged parts) The breakup of Rodinia about 750 million years ago formed the Panthalassa ocean, with rocks that eventually became Japan sitting on its eastern margin. In the Early Silurian (450 million years ago), the subduction of the oceanic plates started, and this process continues to the present day, forming a roughly 400 km wide orogeny at the convergent boundary. Several (9 or 10) oceanic plates were completely subducted and their remains have formed paired metamorphic belts. The most recent complete subduction of a plate was that of the Izanagi Plate 95 million years ago. Currently the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the continental Amurian Plate and the Okinawa Plate to the south at a speed of 4 cm/year, forming the Nankai Trough and the Ryukyu Trench. The Pacific Plate is subducting under the Okhotsk Plate to the north at a speed of 10 cm/year. The early stages of subduction-accretion have recycled the continental crust margin several times, leaving the majority of the modern Japanese archipelago composed of rocks formed in the Permian period or later. =Island arc phase= Around 23 million years ago, western Japan was a coastal region of the Eurasia continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled parts of Japan which become modern Chūgoku region and Kyushu eastward, opening the Sea of Japan (simultaneously with the Sea of Okhotsk) around 15-20 million years ago, with likely freshwater lake state before the sea has rushed in. Around 16 million years ago, in the Miocene period, a peninsula attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent was well formed. About 11 million years before present, the parts of Japan which become modern Tōhoku and Hokkaido were gradually uplifted from the seafloor, and terranes of Chūbu region were gradually accreted from the colliding island chains. The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later, about 2 million years ago. At the same time, a severe subduction of Fossa Magna graben have formed the Kantō Plain. =Current state=General information Overall, the geological composition of Japan is poorly understood. The Japanese islands are formed of several geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing oceanic plates are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while the parts facing the Sea of Japan are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In north-west Japan, the thick quaternary deposits make determination of the geological history especially difficult. Geological structure The Japanese islands are divided into three major geological domains: * Northeastern Japan, north of (which had high volcanic activity 14-17 million years before present) **Idosawa Fault **Senya Fault **Hidaka Mountains **Kitakami Mountains **Ōu Mountains * Central Japan, between Tanakura fault and Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. **Fossa Magna graben **Tanna Fault **Bōsō Hill Range * Southwestern Japan, south of Itoigawa- Shizuoka Tectonic Line. The Southwestern Japan is further subdivided into several metamorphic belts stretched along Japan Median Tectonic Line. The parts of Japan north of Japan Median Tectonic Line (\\"Inner Zone\\") contains many granitoid fragments dating from Paleogene to Cretaceous period intruding the older material, while south of the line (\\"Outer Zone\\") is mostly accretionary complexes of Jurassic period or younger. **Urasoko fault **Fukozu Fault **Neodani Fault **Nojima Fault **Hida orogenic belt (Hida Mountains and Ryōhaku Mountains) **Sangun orogenic belt **Maizuru orogenic belt **Tanba-mino orogenic belt **Ryoke orogenic belt **Shimanto orogenic beltA.

The paper has an average circulation of 47,663. Political leanings The Scranton Times- Tribune editorial policy is generally viewed as independent, but progressive. The Times-Tribune endorsed George W. Bush in 2000, but did not endorse anyone in 2004. The Times-Tribune endorsed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. History The current paper is the result of a 2005 merger between the afternoon Scranton Times and morning Scranton Tribune. The Times was founded in 1870. It struggled under six owners before E. J. Lynett bought the paper in 1895. Within 20 years, the Times was the dominant newspaper in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the third-largest in the state (behind only the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Press). In January 1923, Lynett founded one of Scranton's first radio stations, WQAN.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 1, 1923, page 3. The Lynett family still owns the station today under the calls WEJL. Lynett died in 1943, and his three children took control of the paper with William R. Lynett, the oldest, as publisher. He died in 1946; siblings Edward J. and Elizabeth R. Lynett took over as co-publishers, with Edward J. as editor. Edward J. Lynett died in 1966, and his four children took over; they still run the paper today. Shortly after they took over, the Times expanded to a full week with the appearance of The Sunday Times.Thedailyreview.com, Scranton Times and Scranton Tribune history, from The Daily Review In 1990, the Times bought the remains of its principal rival, the morning Scrantonian-Tribune. This paper had been founded in 1891 as the Scranton Tribune. In 1910, it merged with Scranton's first newspaper, The Morning Republican, and changed its name to the Scranton Republican. It became the Scranton Tribune once again in 1936. In 1938, Richard Little, owner of Scranton's Sunday paper, The Scrantonian (founded 1897), teamed up with M. L. Goodman to buy the Tribune as well. The Goodman-Little family partnership continued for almost half a century, until Richard Little III sold his interest to the Goodmans in 1986. Only a year later, Media One Corporation (no relation to the cable company) bought out the Goodmans and merged the two papers into one seven-day morning paper, The Scrantonian-Tribune. However, Media One was unable to turn the paper around. In 1990, it shuttered the paper. The Lynetts bought the Scrantonian-Tribune nameplate and some other assets, and relaunched the paper as the Scranton Tribune, with much of the same content as the Times (except for timely editing). By 2004, it was obvious that Scranton could no longer support a morning and afternoon paper, and the Lynetts announced that their two papers would merge into one morning paper, The Times-Tribune. The new paper first rolled off the presses on July 27, 2005. However, its legal name is still The Scranton Times; the licensee for sister radio station WEJL and its satellites is \\"The Scranton Times L. P.\\" The paper has appeared a number of times in The Office. Awards The Scranton Times won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1946, while the Scranton Tribune and Scrantonian (then separately owned) won the prize for Local Reporting in 1959.

His arguably best-known role is that of Duisburg detective Horst Schimanski in the TV crime series Tatort. Early years George was born in Berlin-Wannsee into a well known acting family: his father, Heinrich George, was a film and theater actor, and his mother, Berta Drews, a character actress. George is named after his father's favorite, Imperial Knight Götz von Berlichingen. His father was imprisoned by the Soviets and starved in the Soviet concentration camp Sachsenhausen Speziallager Nr. 7 Sachsenhausen. George grew up in Berlin with his elder brother Jan and his mother. He attended school in Berlin-Lichterfelde and later attended the Lyzeum Alpinum in Zuoz, Switzerland. He was married to Loni von Friedl from 1966 to 1976; the couple's daughter, Tanja-Nicole, was born in 1967. Since 1997 he lived together with Hamburg journalist Marika Ullrich ; the couple married in 2014. Acting careerStage= George made his stage debut in 1950, performing a role in William Saroyan's My Heart's in the Highlands. From 1955 to 1958 he also studied at the Berlin UFA- Nachwuchsstudio, though he received the crucial part of his acting education between 1958 and 1963. Following his mother's advice he occasionally played at the Deutsches Theater in Göttingen under the direction of Heinz Hilpert. After Hilpert's death, George would never join a fixed theater company again, although he did regularly perform on tours and as a guest performer. Hansgünther Heyme signed him in 1972 to the Kölner Schauspielhaus, where George played Martin Luther in Dieter Forte's Martin Luther und Thomas Münzer. His most important stage achievement, in his own opinion, was the lead role in Büchner's Danton's Death during the Salzburg Festival in 1981. In 1986 and 1987 George, together with Eberhard Feik and Helmut Stauss, stage-managed Gogol's The Government Inspector. Performing in Anton Chekhov's Platonov, George went on his last theater tour. =Cinema and television= In 1953 he was able to get a small film role next to Romy Schneider in When the White Lilacs Bloom Again. In the same year he played, as he would often do from then on, next to his mother in Shakespeare's Richard III. After small movie parts during the 1950s, Götz George broke through with audiences and critics in the film Jacqueline (1959). George was awarded the Bundesfilmpreis and the Preis der Filmkritik for his role. In 1962 he received the Bambi Award as the most popular actor. In the sixties, George got the chance to show that he is able to do more than playing sappy peasants, through roles in movies such as Kirmes, playing a desperate Wehrmacht deserter, and Herrenpartie. More often, though, he performed in comedies and action-oriented movies which benefited from his physical presence. He became well known to a broad audience when, during his theater tour in Göttingen, Horst Wendlandt persuaded him to play in one of the Karl May series of films, which he started in 1962 with Der Schatz im Silbersee. It was originally planned to give him the lead role, but this plan was abandoned when Lex Barker was hired to play the role of Old Shatterhand, so George played the farmer son Fred Engel. George performed all stunts himself, even in his lead role as sheriff in Sie nannten ihn Gringo. George in 2009 In the 1970s he turned primarily to stage roles and to television, including the many episodes of Der Kommissar, Tatort, Derrick, and The Old Fox for which he would become famous. It was not until 1977 that he was cast in a prominent role again, playing Franz Lang in Death is My Trade, a character modeled after Auschwitz commander Rudolf Höß. George probably had his greatest popular success in the eighties on TV: in Tatort episodes of the WDR, broadcast from 1981 to 1991, he portrayed proletarian police officer Horst Schimanski, who eventually became a cult figure in Germany. In 1984 and 1987 he again won the Bambi Award as the most popular actor. The series of Schulz & Schulz movies, starting in 1989 and dealing with the issue of the German reunification, gave him the opportunity to show his talents as a comedian in a double role, as did the role of the industry consultant in the series of the same name, which is rather far removed from the roughneck charm of senior commissar Schimanski. Among George's most impressive roles in the nineties were his appearances in the television movie ', in which he portrayed the alleged serial killer and writer Henry Kupfer as a cold, calculating and manipulative intellectual, the movie Deathmaker (Der Totmacher), in which he portrayed Fritz Haarmann (The Butcher of Hanover), and in the television movie Die Bubi-Scholz-Story (based on Bubi Scholz), the trauma of an aged, broken boxer.  Death  George died at the age of 77 after a short illness.

Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. HistoryObject-Oriented Programming= Iterative design is connected with the practice of object-oriented programming, and the phrase appeared in computer science literature as early as 1990. The idea has its roots in spiral development, conceived of by Barry Boehm. Iterative design process The iterative design process may be applied throughout the new product development process. However, changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development. The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a prototype. The prototype should be evaluated by a focus group or a group not associated with the product in order to deliver non-biased opinions. Information from the focus group should be synthesized and incorporated into the next iteration of the design. The process should be repeated until user issues have been reduced to an acceptable level. =Application: Human computer interfaces= Iterative design is commonly used in the development of human computer interfaces. This allows designers to identify any usability issues that may arise in the user interface before it is put into wide use. Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so a usability engineering lifecycle should be built around the concept of iteration. The typical steps of iterative design in user interfaces are as follows: # Complete an initial interface design # Present the design to several test users # Note any problems had by the test user # Refine interface to account for/fix the problems # Repeat steps 2-4 until user interface problems are resolved Iterative design in user interfaces can be implemented in many ways. One common method of using iterative design in computer software is software testing. While this includes testing the product for functionality outside of the user interface, important feedback on the interface can be gained from subject testing early versions of a program. This allows software companies to release a better quality product to the public, and prevents the need of product modification following its release. Iterative design in online (website) interfaces is a more continual process, as website modification, after it has been released to the user, is far more viable than in software design. Often websites use their users as test subjects for interface design, making modifications based on recommendations from visitors to their sites. Iterative design use Iterative design is a way of confronting the reality of unpredictable user needs and behaviors that can lead to sweeping and fundamental changes in a design. User testing will often show that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Thus, it is important that the flexibility of the iterative design's implementation approach extends as far into the system as possible. Designers must further recognize that user testing results may suggest radical change that requires the designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs. Iterative design applies in many fields, from making knives to rockets. As an example consider the design of an electronic circuit that must perform a certain task, and must ultimately fit in a small space on a circuit board. It is useful to split these independent tasks into two smaller and simpler tasks, the functionality task, and the space and weight task. A breadboard is a useful way of implementing the electronic circuit on an interim basis, without having to worry about space and weight. Once the circuit works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design. When the design is finalized, one can set about designing a proper circuit board meeting the space and weight criteria. Compacting the circuit on the circuit board requires that the wires and components be juggled around without changing their electrical characteristics. This juggling follows simpler rules than the design of the circuit itself, and is often automated. As far as possible off the shelf components are used, but where necessary for space or performance reasons, custom made components may be developed. Several instances of iterative design are as follows: *Wiki: A wiki is a natural repository for iterative design. The 'Page History' facility allows tracking back to prior versions. Modifications are mostly incremental, and leave substantial parts of the text unchanged. *Common law: The principle of legal precedent builds on past experience. This makes law a form of iterative design where there should be a clear audit trail of the development of legal thought. *Evolution: There is a parallel between iterative and the theory of natural Selection. Both involve a trial and error process in which the most suitable design advances to the next generation, while less suitable designs perish by the wayside. Subsequent versions of a product should also get progressively better as its producers learn what works and what doesn't in a process of refinement and continual improvement. Fast prototyping tools One approach to iterative design is to use the highest level of abstraction for developing an early generation product. The principle here is that rapid development may not produce efficient code, but obtaining feedback is more important that technology optimization. Examples of this approach include use of non-functional code, object databases, or low code platforms - these allow quick testing of designs before issues of optimization are addressed. Benefits When properly applied, iterative design will ensure a product or process is the best solution possible. When applied early in the development stage, significant cost savings are possible. Other benefits to iterative design include: # Serious misunderstandings are made evident early in the lifecycle, when it's possible to react to them. # It enables and encourages user feedback, so as to elicit the system's real requirements. # Where the work is contracted, Iterative Design provides an incremental method for more effectively involving the client in the complexities that often surround the design process. # The development team is forced to focus on those issues that are most critical to the project, and team members are shielded from those issues that distract and divert them from the project's real risks. # Continual testing enables an objective assessment of the project's status. # Inconsistencies among requirements, designs, and implementations are detected early. # The workload of the team, especially the testing team, is spread out more evenly throughout the lifecycle. # This approach enables the team to leverage lessons learned, and therefore to continually improve the process. # Stakeholders in the project can be given concrete evidence of the project's status throughout the lifecycle. Marshmallow Challenge Marshmallow challenge winning work. The Marshmallow Challenge is an instructive design challenge. It involves the task of constructing the highest possible free-standing structure with a marshmallow on top. The structure must be completed within 18 minutes using only 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, and one yard of string. Observation and studies of participants show that kindergartners are regularly able to build higher structures, in comparison to groups of business school graduates. This is explained by the tendency for children to at once stick the marshmallow on top of a simple structure, test the prototype, and continue to improve upon it. Whereas, business school students tend to spend time vying for power, planning, and finally producing a structure to which the marshmallow is added. The challenge helps to build and develop prototyping, teamwork, leadership and innovation skills and is a popular STEM activity. The challenge was invented by Peter Skillman of Palm, Inc. and popularized by Tom Wujec of Autodesk.

It is the third day of Holy Week in Eastern Christianity, after Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday, and the second day of Holy Week in Western Christianity, after Palm Sunday. Biblical narrative The Gospels say some of the events that occurred on the day of the Biblical Holy Monday. Some of the most notable and recognizable of these were the cursing of the fig tree (, ), the questioning of Jesus' authority (), the Cleansing of the Temple and some diverse parables, depending on which Gospel is read. Western Christianity In the Roman Catholic Church, the Gospel lesson at Mass is , which chronologically occurred before the Entry into Jerusalem described in . Other readings used are and :1-3, 13-14. In the Revised Common Lectionary, which is used by the Anglican Communion, Methodist Churches, Lutheran Churches, Old Catholic Churches and Reformed Churches, the Scripture lessons are (First Reading), (Psalm), (Second Reading), and , (Gospel Reading). In traditional Methodist usage, The Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) provides the following Collect for Holy Monday: Eastern Christianity Joseph sold into slavery by his brothers (Konstantin Flavitsky, 1855). In the Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches that follow the Byzantine Rite, this day is referred to as Great and Holy Monday, or Great Monday. On this day the Church commemorates the withering of the fruitless fig tree (), a symbol of judgement that will befall those who do not bring forth the fruits of repentance. The hymns on this day also recall Joseph, the son of Jacob, whose innocent suffering at the hand of his brethren (), and false accusation (-) are a type (foreshadowing) of the Passion of Christ. The day begins liturgically with Vespers on Palm Sunday night, repeating some of the same stichera (hymns) from the Praises of the All Night Vigil the evening before. At Small Compline a Triode (Canon composed of three Odes), written by St. Andrew of Crete is chanted. The Matins service for Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week is known as the Bridegroom Service or Bridegroom Prayer, because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the troparion that is solemnly chanted near the beginning of the service. On these days, an icon of \\"Christ the Bridegroom\\" is placed on an analogion in the center of the temple, portraying Jesus wearing the purple robe of mockery and crowned with a crown of thorns (see Instruments of the Passion). The Matins Gospel read on this day is from the Gospel of Matthew ). The canon at Matins has only three odes in it (a triode), and was composed by St. Cosmas of Maiuma. The four Gospels are divided and read in their entirety at the Little Hours (Third Hour, Sixth Hour and Ninth Hour) during the course of the first three days of Holy Week, halting at .

As of December 31, 2018, it operates 811 hotels with 114,614 rooms across 63 countries under the Ramada brand.wyndhamhotels.com  Name  The Ramada name derives from the Spanish term rama (meaning \\"branch\\").Bartleby.com Temporary open air structures called \\"ramadas\\" (meaning \\"porch\\" or \\"arbor\\"), made of brush or branches (similar to an arbor) were popular in Arizona during harvest time.Findarticles.com Company websites commonly refer to the structure as a \\"shady resting place\\".Travelsites.com  History  The friendly and balding Uncle Ben, on a Ramada Inn swizzle stick. In the early days, Ramada had branded on-site restaurants and lounges. Longtime Chicago restaurateur Marion W. Isbell (1905–1988) founded the chain in 1953 along with a group of investors including Michael Robinson of McAllen, Texas (who later went on to start Rodeway Inns in the early 1960s) and Del Webb of Phoenix (who owned the New York Yankees and went on to establish his own lodging chain, Hiway House, in 1956). Other original investors of Ramada Inns included Isbell's brother- in-law Bill Helsing; Max Sherman, a produce operator from Chicago dubbed \\"The Tomato King\\"; Chicago attorneys Ezra Ressman and Mort Levin; and Frank Lichtenstein and Robert Rosow of San Antonio, Texas. Early in 1952, Marion W. Isbell received a phone call from his brother-in-law, Bill Helsing. Bill informed him of a hotel deal in Flagstaff, AZ that he was going to invest in and wanted to know if Marion would be interested in joining him. This first investment resulted in a rapid return of capital. Ramada opened its first hotel, a 60-room facility, on U.S. Route 66 at Flagstaff, Arizona in 1954 and set up its headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, where the chain built the Sahara Hotel on North 1st Street downtown in 1956 (which later became the Ramada Inn Downtown) and a 300-room Ramada Inn in the 3800 block of East Van Buren in 1958 that would become the chain's flagship property and headquarters. Like his contemporary, Holiday Inn hotel-chain founder Kemmons Wilson, Isbell devised the idea of building and operating a chain of roadside motor hotels when, while on a cross-country trip with his wife Ingrid and their three children, he noted the substandard quality of roadside motor courts along US highways at the time. He saw the possibility in the developing market for a chain of roadside motor hotels conveniently located along major highways which would provide lodgings with hotel-like quality at near-motel rates plus amenities such as TV, air conditioning, swimming pools, and on-premises restaurants. From its start in the 1950s until around 1976, Ramada's logo featured a friendly bald innkeeper, dubbed \\"Uncle Ben\\". He sported an apron (later a suit and tie) and held a top hat in one hand; in the other hand was a red trumpeted banner that read \\"Ramada Inn Roadside Hotels\\". From 1976 to 1982, the chain's logo was a simple rounded rectangle that read \\"Ramada Inn\\" in the original design's gothic Western-style lettering. of the original design. From 1982 to 2004, Ramada changed to a revised, rounded rectangular design with more \\"modern\\" lettering. At one point the chain was owned by Ramada Inns, Inc., a holding company set up by Isbell to oversee Ramada's various divisions including hotel operations, franchising, real estate, and equipment purchasing. Under Isbell's leadership, Ramada grew into one of the nation's largest lodging chains during the 1960s and 1970s with 100 Ramada Inns in operation by 1964, which grew to 250 in 1970 and nearly 650 by 1976. By the late 1970s, Ramada ranked as the second-largest hotel chain in the U.S. behind industry leader Holiday Inn. Also during the 1970s, Ramada expanded into worldwide operation by opening new hotels in various European nations and on other continents. Marion W. Isbell served as president and CEO of Ramada until 1970, when he resigned the presidency and turned it over to his son, William M. Isbell. The senior Isbell continued as the chain's CEO until his retirement in 1972, then Chairman of the Board until 1979. William M. Isbell would serve as Ramada's president and CEO until 1981. Ramada developed a chain of in-hotel restaurants similar to the Howard Johnson's restaurants, operating them under various names including Uncle Ben's Kitchen, Ramada Pancake Cottage, and Chez Bon, as well as other names used by individual franchises. The company-owned Ramada restaurants became defunct in 1990, though the franchised hotels still include on-premises restaurants. =Split of hotel and casino operations= In an attempt to revive the company's lagging business in 1989, Ramada Inns, Inc. decided to split its hotel/restaurant businesses and its gaming businesses. The Ramada hotels and restaurants were sold for $540 million to New World Development Company and the gaming business which included the Tropicana Las Vegas, Tropicana Atlantic City, and Ramada Express in Laughlin, Nevada, were spun off to a new company called Aztar Corporation. In the original deal for the gaming business, Ramada shareholders were to get $7 in cash per share plus half a share of the new Aztar Corporation. However, this changed quickly to a new deal where shareholders would receive $1 per share plus one share of Aztar Corporation. In the late 1990s, Ramada was sold to Cendant Corporation of New York City. In February 2018, Interstate Europe Hotels & Resorts took over the management of Ramada Encore hotel, Bournemouth. Hotel tiers The chain offers different hotel \\"tiers\\" based on price and services offered.Ramada: President's letter *Ramada Limited—budget-oriented properties, typically with no on-site restaurant, though a pool and deluxe continental breakfast are standard. Some Ramada Limiteds consist of rooms mixed with suites, or are entirely suites. *Ramada Inn/Inn & Suites/Suites—full-service properties with swimming pools, exercise rooms, room service, and free breakfast items. If there is no restaurant on site, a convenience store is usually on the premises. Some hotels have mixed rooms and suites, and a few are entirely suites. *Ramada Hotel/Hotel & Suites/Hotel & Resort—found only outside the US, these are full-service hotels with room service, a full-service restaurant, and fully developed fitness centers. Many of the international hotels also offer suites in addition to rooms, and a few have a resort and hotel together. *Ramada Plaza—lower \\"upscale\\" properties offering business centers, full-restaurants, enhanced room service, and concierges at many locations. *Ramada Resorts—found in locations outside the USA; located in tourist destinations and high-traffic locations. One of the \\"tiers\\" is no longer part of Ramada: *Ramada Renaissance—a division of upscale business and resort hotels begun in 1982. When Ramada was sold in 1989, the new owners divided the Renaissance Hotels brand into its own chain, and then sold it to Marriott in 1997. Under Cendant/Wyndham ownership Under Cendant's (and now Wyndham's) ownership, Ramada franchises Ramada Inn, Ramada Limited, Ramada Plaza, and Ramada Suites in the United States and Canada. Ramada itself no longer directly or indirectly owns or operates any of the Ramada hotels. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Ramada hotels are owned and operated or franchised by Ramada International, which was owned by hotel operator Marriott International. However, in 2004, Ramada International was purchased by Cendant, giving Cendant the worldwide rights to the Ramada name. Ramada International remains separate from the Ramada operations in the United States and Canada. In 2006, Cendant spun off its hotel operations, including Ramada, to Wyndham Worldwide. International Ramada Colombo, January 2016. In Australia, Ramada Inn is a traditional motel in Parkville, Melbourne affiliated with the Australian \\"Golden Chain\\" group of hotels and motels. It underwent extensive renovation recently, but is known locally for its use of the humorous Uncle Ben vintage logo and idiosyncratic abbreviation of the word \\"kilometre\\" on its signage. In the United Kingdom, Jarvis Hotels Ltd were the largest franchisee of the Ramada brand. They operated corporately as \\"Ramada Jarvis Hotels\\". Six of the properties were bannered as Country Collection hotels; they are properties that were historic buildings that had been owned by local business magnates and in beautiful landscaped gardens. Ramada Jarvis went into liquidation in September 2011, ceasing trade on every hotel formerly franchised from Ramada. Ramada's United Kingdom operations came to an end. Shortly after, selected Days Hotels were rebranded as Ramada hotels, bringing the brand back to the United Kingdom. Ramada manages three properties in Indonesia. Two of which located at Bali, and one at Surakarta. Ramada International manages three hotels on Sri Lanka's western coast, under the \\"Ramada\\" name, including one in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo. The Ramada Colombo used to be the Holiday Inn Colombo but management has changed. Ramada International also operates three hotels in Pakistan, under the same name \\"Ramada\\", in cities including Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan. Ramada Lahore Gulberg II is opening soon in 2020. Ramada Lahore is opening on Cooper Road in 2023. It was announced that Ramada would open new units in Brazil by 2016.

Members of the genus are commonly known as pepper trees. The Peruvian pepper tree (Schinus molle) is the source of the spice known as pink peppercorns. They can become an invasive species outside their natural habitats. Schinus polygama, although less well known, is also potentially weedy in mesic areas. Taxonomy The generic name is derived from the Greek word for Pistacia lentiscus, Σχίνος (schinos), which it resembles. There has been considerable historic confusion as to the correct gender of the genus name; as of 2015 this has been resolved with the determination that the correct gender of Schinus is feminine (rather than masculine), and adjectival names within the genus must be spelled accordingly.Zona, S.

It is the ortho isomer of the three isomeric benzenediols. This colorless compound occurs naturally in trace amounts. It was first discovered by destructive distillation of the plant extract catechin. About 20,000 tonnes of catechol is now synthetically produced annually as a commodity organic chemical, mainly as a precursor to pesticides, flavors, and fragrances. Catechol occurs as feathery white crystals that are very rapidly soluble in water. Isolation and synthesis Catechol was first isolated in 1839 by Edgar Hugo Emil Reinsch (1809–1884) by distilling it from the solid tannic preparation catechin, which is the residuum of catechu, the boiled or concentrated juice of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu).Hugo Reinsch (1839) \\"Einige Bemerkungen über Catechu\\" (Some observations about catechu), Repertorium für die Pharmacie, 68 : 49-58. Reinsch describes the preparaton of catechol on p. 56: \\"Bekanntlich wird die Katechusäure bei der Destillation zerstört, während sich ein geringer Theil davon als krystallinischer Anflug sublimirt, welcher aber noch nicht näher untersucht worden ist. Diese Säure ist vielleicht dieselbe, welche ich bei der zerstörenden Destillation des Katechus erhalten; … \\" (As is well known, catechu acid is destroyed by distillation, while a small portion of it sublimates as a crystalline efflorescence, which however has still not been closely examined. This acid is perhaps the same one, which I obtained by destructive distillation of catechu; … ). On p. 58, Reinsch names the new compound: \\"Die Eigenschaften dieser Säure sind so bestimmt, dass man sie füglich als eine eigenthümliche Säure betrachten und sie mit dem Namen Brenz- Katechusäure belegen kann.\\" (The properties of this acid are so definite, that one can regard it justifiably as a strange acid and give it the name \\"burned catechu acid\\".) Upon heating catechin above its decomposition point, a substance that Reinsch first named Brenz-Katechusäure (burned catechu acid) sublimated as a white efflorescence. This was a thermal decomposition product of the flavanols in catechin. In 1841, both Wackenroder and Zwenger independently rediscovered catechol; in reporting on their findings, Philosophical Magazine coined the name pyrocatechin.See: * H. Wackenroder (1841) \\"Eigenschaften der Catechusäure\\" (Properties of catechu acid), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 37 : 306-320. * Constantin Zwenger (1841) \\"Ueber Catechin\\" (On catechin), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 37 : 320-336. * (Anon.) (1841) \\"On catechin (catechinic acid) and pyrocatechin (pyrocatechinic acid)\\", Philosophical Magazine, 19 : 194-195. By 1852, Erdmann realized that catechol was benzene with two oxygen atoms added to it; in 1867, August Kekulé realized that catechol was a diol of benzene, so by 1868, catechol was listed as pyrocatechol.See: * Rudolf Wagner (1852) \\"Ueber die Farbstoffe des Gelbholzes (Morus tinctoria.)\\" (On the coloring matter of Dyer's mulberry (Morus tinctoria.)), Journal für praktische Chemie, 55 : 65-76.

See also p. 720. In 1879, the Journal of the Chemical Society recommended that catechol be called \\"catechol\\", and in the following year, it was listed as such.See: * In 1879, the Publication Committee of the Journal of the Chemical Society issued instructions to its abstractors to \\"Distinguish all alcohols, i.e., hydroxyl-derivations of hydrocarbons, by names ending in ol, e.g., quinol, catechol, … \\" See: Alfred H.

(London, England: Longmans, Green and Co., 1880), p.524. Catechol has since been shown to occur in free-form naturally in kino and in beechwood tar. Its sulfonic acid has been detected in the urine of horses and humans. Catechol is produced industrially by the hydroxylation of phenol using hydrogen peroxide.Fiegel, Helmut et al. (2002) \\"Phenol Derivatives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. . :C6H5OH + H2O2 → C6H4(OH)2 \\\\+ H2O Previously, it was produced by hydroxylation of salicylaldehyde using hydrogen peroxide, as well as the hydrolysis of 2-substituted phenols, especially 2-chlorophenol, with hot aqueous solutions containing alkali metal hydroxides. Its methyl ether derivative, guaiacol, converts to catechol via hydrolysis of the CH3-O bond as promoted by hydriodic acid.  Reactions  Organic chemistry = Like other difunctional benzene derivatives, catechol readily condenses to form heterocyclic compounds. Cyclic esters are formed upon treatment with dichloro electrophiles. For example, using phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus oxychloride gives the cyclic chlorophosphonite or chlorophosphonate, respectively; sulfuryl chloride gives the sulfate; and phosgene gives the carbonate: :C6H4(OH)2 \\\\+ XCl2 → C6H4(O2X) + 2 HCl ::where X = PCl or P(O)Cl; SO2; CO. Catechols produce quinones with the addition of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN). = With metal ions = Catechol is the conjugate acid of a chelating agent used widely in coordination chemistry. Basic solutions of catechol react with iron(III) to give the red [Fe(C6H4O2)3]3−. Ferric chloride gives a green coloration with the aqueous solution, while the alkaline solution rapidly changes to a green and finally to a black color on exposure to the air. Iron-containing dioxygenase enzymes catalyze the cleavage of catechol. = Redox chemistry = Catechol is produced by a reversible two- electron, two-proton reduction of 1,2-benzoquinone (E° = +795 mV vs SHE; Em (pH 7) = +380 mV vs SHE). :Electrochemical interconversion of 1,2-benzoquinone and catechol The redox series catecholate dianion, monoanionic semiquinonate, and benzoquinone are collectively called dioxolenes. Dioxolenes are used as ligands.  Natural occurrences  Small amounts of catechol occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, along with the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (also known as catecholase, or catechol oxidase). Upon mixing the enzyme with the substrate and exposure to oxygen (as when a potato or apple is cut and left out), the colorless catechol oxidizes to reddish-brown melanoid pigments, derivatives of benzoquinone. The enzyme is inactivated by adding an acid, such as the citric acid contained in lemon juice. Excluding oxygen also prevents the browning reaction. However, the activity of the enzyme increases in cooler temperatures. Benzoquinone is said to be antimicrobial, a property that slows the spoilage of damaged fruits and other plant parts. It is one of the main natural phenols in argan oil, and is a component of castoreum, a substance from the castor gland of beavers, used in perfumery. It is also found in Agaricus bisporus. = Presence of the catechol moiety = Catechol moieties are also found widely within the natural world. Arthropod cuticle consists of chitin linked by a catechol moiety to protein. The cuticle may be strengthened by cross-linking (tanning and sclerotization), in particular, in insects, and of course by biomineralization. Catechols such as DHSA are produced through the metabolism of cholesterol by bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.; Urushiols are naturally existing organic compounds that have the catechol skeleton structure and diphenol functionality but with alkyl groups substituted onto the aromatic ring. Urushiols are the skin-irritating poisons found in plants like poison ivy, etc. Catecholamines are biochemically significant phenethylamine hormones and neurotransmitters in which the phenyl group has a catechol skeleton structure. The molecule catechin, another natural compound present in tea, contains a catechol group.  Uses  Approximately 50% of the synthetic catechol is consumed in the production of pesticides, the remainder being used as a precursor to fine chemicals such as perfumes and pharmaceuticals. It is a common building block in organic synthesis.Barner, B. A. (2004) \\"Catechol\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette), J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . Several industrially significant flavors and fragrances are prepared starting from catechol. Guaiacol is prepared by methylation of catechol and is then converted to vanillin on a scale of about 10M kg per year (1990). The related monoethyl ether of catechol, guethol, is converted to ethylvanillin, a component of chocolate confectioneries. 3-Trans- Isocamphylcyclohexanol, widely used as a replacement for sandalwood oil, is prepared from catechol via guaiacol and camphor. Piperonal, a flowery scent, is prepared from the methylene diether of catechol followed by condensation with glyoxal and decarboxylation.Fahlbusch, Karl-Georg et al. (2003) \\"Flavors and Fragrances\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim . Catechol is used as a black-and-white photographic developer, but, except for some special purpose applications, its use is largely historical. It is rumored to have been used briefly in Eastman Kodak's HC-110 developer and is rumored to be a component in Tetenal's Neofin Blau developer. It is a key component of Finol from Moersch Photochemie in Germany. Modern catechol developing was pioneered by noted photographer Sandy King. His \\"PyroCat\\" formulation is popular among modern black-and-white film photographers. King's work has since inspired further 21st-century development by others such as Jay De Fehr with Hypercat and Obsidian Acqua developers, and others.  Catechol derivatives  The catechol skeleton occurs in a variety of natural products such as urushiols, which are the skin-irritating poisons found in plants like poison ivy, and catecholamines, drugs imitating them (such as MDMA), hormones/neurotransmitters, and catechin, which is found in tea. Many pyrocatechin derivatives have been suggested for therapeutic applications.  Nomenclature  Although rarely encountered, the officially \\"preferred IUPAC name\\" (PIN) of catechol is benzene-1,2-diol.Preferred IUPAC Names.

After 1349, there were actually two Kanrei, the Kyoto Kanrei and the Kantō Kanrei. Originally, from 1219 until 1333, the post was synonymous with the Rokuhara Tandai,The Kamakura shogunate reserved for itself an area in Kyōto called where lived its representatives, who were supposed to protect its interests and was based in Kyoto. The Hōjō clan monopolized this post, and there were during this period two Deputies – a southern chief, and a northern chief. From 1336 to 1367, the Deputy was called . The first to hold this title was Kō no Moronao. In 1367, Hosokawa Yoriyuki was chosen by a council to become Deputy (Kyoto Kanrei). In order to ensure the loyalty of his colleagues, the Hatakeyama and Shiba clans, he proposed that three families share the position of Kanrei, alternating between them every time a new appointment was needed. Thus was born the San-Kan or Three Kanrei. However, in 1379, Yoriyuki's actions attracted the resentment of certain powerful lords, who pressed for his dismissal. After that, the Kyoto Kanrei no longer held the responsibilities of Shogun's Deputy, and merely carried out his orders in an advisory and executive position. Following the fall of the Kamakura shogunate, and abolition of the Rokuhara Tandai position, Ashikaga Takauji created the post of Kantō Kanrei, or Shogun's Deputy in the East (Kantō generally refers to the area around and including modern Tokyo). The Kantō Kanrei In the first weeks of 1336Gregorian date obtained directly from the original Nengō using Nengocalc : (Kenmu era, 1st month) Ashikaga Takauji left Kamakura for Kyoto in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada.Kokushi Daijiten (1983:542) He left behind his 4-year-old son Yoshiakira as his representative in the trust of three guardians: Hosokawa Kiyouji, Uesugi Noriaki, and Shiba Ienaga.Jansen (1995:119–120) In 1349 Takauji called Yoshiakira to Kyoto, replacing him with another of his sons, Motouji, to whom he gave the title of Kantō Kanrei. Because the kanrei was the son of the shōgun, ruled Kantō and controlled the military there, the area was usually called Kamakura Bakufu, or Kamakura shogunate, and Motouji Shogun or Kamakura/Kantō Gosho, an equivalent title. When later the habit of calling kubō the shogun spread from Kyoto to the Kantō, the ruler of Kamakura came to be called Kamakura kubō. The Kanrei title was then passed on to the Uesugi hereditary . Members of the Uesugi clan thereafter dominated the Kantō kanrei post until 1552, when it was abolished. The political organization of the Ashikaga shogunate was complex, and shifted from time to time. The responsibilities and official title of the Kanrei or Deputy changed a number of times, as other positions were created or abolished. In addition, they worked alongside a number of other posts, such as the Kyūshū Tandai, who represented the shōguns interests and orders in the southernmost of the main islands.

Richard Jones and starring Mabel Normand.Progressive Silent Film List: The Extra Girl at silentera.com Produced by Mack Sennett, The Extra Girl followed earlier films about the film industry and also paved the way for later films about Hollywood, such as King Vidor’s Show People (1928). It was still unusual in 1923 for filmmakers to make a film about the southern California film industry, then little more than ten years old. Still, many of the Hollywood clichés of small town girls travelling to Hollywood to become film stars are here to reinforce the myths of Tinseltown. Plot Sue Graham (Normand) is a small town girl who travels to Hollywood to escape marriage, and in the hope of becoming a motion picture star. She wins a contract with a studio on the strength of a picture of a quite different (and very attractive) girl sent instead of hers; but when she arrives the mistake is discovered. Since the error was the result of another’s deception, the studio manager agrees to give her a job in the costume department. She eventually gets the opportunity to screen test, but it turns out disastrously – although in a nod to the actress behind the character the director calls her \\"a natural comedian.\\" Sue's parents come out to California, and invest money with a shifty individual who swindles them out of their life savings. Sue and childhood friend Dave, who has also followed her, retrieve the money. Despite the unsuccessful film career, all turns out well.

Producer Mack Sennett can be glimpsed briefly as a straw-hatted onlooker at Sue's screen test. Production Directed by F. Richard Jones, the film features several shots of semi-rural Southern California (the Edendale area along present-day Glendale Boulevard, where Sennett's studio was located) showing houses and streets of the early 1920s, and of a Hollywood studio in action. One shot in particular, a high-angle view, shows a film set, with actors, two cameras and operators, several production people, and a mood orchestra composed of a pianist and violinist, to set the proper mood for the actors. Another shows an open stage with crew scrambling up scaffolding to the sunlight diffusing panels above. The Extra Girl was Normand's final feature film and her last film working with producer Sennett. Survival Prints of The Extra Girl are held in several archives and it has been released on DVD.

Background  Before Meiorin, Human Rights violations were treated in one of two ways; either as \\"direct discrimination\\", pursuant to the analysis in Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Etobicoke (Borough of), [1982] 1 SCR 202; or as \\"adverse effects discrimination\\", pursuant to the analysis in Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Simpsons-Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 SCR 536. Academic writing deeply criticized this bifurcation of analysis as arbitrary and unhelpful in protecting equality rights. With the Meiorin case, the court decided to confront this criticism and refashion the analysis. = Facts = Tawney Meiorin was employed as a firefighter by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests. Three years after being hired, the government adopted a series of fitness tests that all employees were required to pass. She passed all the tests except for one that required her to run 2.5 km in 11 minutes. After four attempts, her best time was 49.4 seconds over the maximum allowed. As a result, she was fired.  Reasoning of the Court  Though the fitness tests had a valid purpose of ensuring safety, the court found that the research that the tests were based on was incomplete and \\"impressionistic\\" and did not take into account the differences between men and women in establishing a standard. To reach this conclusion, the court examined the previous methods of analyzing Human Rights violations, noting where they were deficient, and then proposed a new \\"Meiorin Test\\" to which the current facts are applied. McLachlin J (as she was then) noted that the greatest deficiency in having two different approaches is that one afforded a greater amount of remedy than the other which provoked parties to abuse this distinction. There was the further problem that it had the overall effect of legitimizing systemic discrimination. As well, it created a dissonance between Human Rights analysis and Charter analysis.  Meiorin test  An employer can justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities: # that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; # that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and # that the standard was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer. :(per McLachlin, emphasis added) = Rational connection = In practice, this step has been shown to be easily satisfied. It is mostly used to motivate the parties to identify what the general purpose or goal of the standard is, and will only fail in the most egregious cases. This step has a close connection to the \\"rational connection\\" inquiry within the Oakes test which has been shown to have similar effect. = Good faith = This step addresses the subjective element of test. Though it is not essential to the determination of a BFOR it captures many \\"direct discrimination\\" cases. = Undue hardship = This step is the most decisive of them all. It must show that reasonable alternatives and accommodations have been looked into and reasonably dismissed due to undue hardship. Sopinka J, in Central Okanagan School District No 23 v Renaud [1992] 2 SCR 970, stated, \\"[T]he use of the term 'undue' infers that some hardship is acceptable; it is only 'undue' hardship that satisfies this test.\\" The exact measurement of undue hardship is the combination of a variety of factors. Wilson J identified several in Alberta Dairy Pool including financial costs of accommodations, interchangeability of the workforce and facilities, and the interference of other employees rights. At paragraph 65 of Meiorin, McLachlin J suggests six lines of inquiry to consider: #Has the employer investigated alternative approaches that do not have a discriminatory effect, such as individual testing against a more individually sensitive standard? #If alternative standards were investigated and found to be capable of fulfilling the employer's purpose, why were they not implemented? #Is it necessary to have all employees meet the single standard for the employer to accomplish its legitimate purpose or could standards reflective of group or individual differences and capabilities be established? #Is there a way to do the job that is less discriminatory while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate purpose? #Is the standard properly designed to ensure that the desired qualification is met without placing an undue burden on those to whom the standard applies? # Have other parties who are obliged to assist in the search for possible accommodation fulfilled their roles? As Sopinka J. noted in Renaud, supra, at pp. 992–96, the task of determining how to accommodate individual differences may also place burdens on the employee and, if there is a collective agreement, a union.

Early life Kohut was born on 3 May 1913, in Vienna, Austria, to Felix Kohut and Else Kohut (née Lampl). He was the only child of the family. Kohut's parents were assimilated Jews living in Alsergrund, or the Ninth District, and they had married two years previously. His father was an aspiring concert pianist, but he abandoned his dreams having been traumatized by his experiences in World War I and moved into business with a man named Paul Bellak. His mother opened her own shop sometime after the war, something that few women would do at the time in Vienna. Else's relationship with her son can be described as “narcissistic enmeshment”. Kohut was not put into school until the fifth grade. Before that he was taught by several tutors, a line of “Fräuleins and mademoiselles”. Special care was taken that he learned French. From 1924 on he attended the Döblinger Gymnasium in Grinzing or the 19th District, where the Kohuts would build a house. During his time at the school he had one more tutor, but the role of this person was to engage him in educational discussions, to take him to museums, galleries, and the opera. This man was the first friend in his life. Before that he had been isolated from his peers by his mother. At school a special emphasis was given to the Greek and Latin languages and Greek and Roman literature. Kohut also came to appreciate Goethe, Thomas Mann and Robert Musil. In 1929 Kohut spent two months in Saint-Quay-Portrieux in Brittany, in order to study French. At school he wrote his thesis on Euripides’ play The Cyclops. His Latin teacher, who had anti-Semitic sentiments and later participated in the Austrian Nazi movement, accused him of having plagiariazed this work. The thesis was accepted after Kohut’s father intervened. Kohut entered the medical faculty of the University of Vienna in 1932. His studies took six years, during which time he spent six months in internships in Paris, first at the Hôtel-Dieu and then at the Hôpital Saint-Louis. The latter hospital was specialized in the treatment of syphilis, which provided shocking experiences for Kohut. In Paris he became acquainted with Jacques Palaci, a Jewish medical student from Istanbul, and paid a visit to him in 1936. The following year Kohut’s father died of leukemia. Sometime after this Kohut entered psychotherapy with a man named Walter Marseilles, who does not seem to have been very competent at his trade. Early in 1938 Kohut began a psychoanalysis with August Aichhorn, a close friend of Sigmund Freud. After Austria was annexed to Germany by Hitler on 12 March 1938, the new regime meant difficulties for Kohut, as he still had to take his final exams at the medical faculty. He was eventually allowed to take them, after all the Jewish professors had been removed from the university. The Nazis then effectively confiscated all property owned by Jews. The property had to be sold at much less than its real value, and much of the rest was taken by the state in taxes. Kohut eventually left Austria, landing first in a refugee camp in Kent, England. Many of his relatives, who had stayed behind, were subsequently killed in the Holocaust. In February 1940 he was allowed to travel in a British convoy to Boston, from where he travelled to Chicago by bus. A friend from Vienna, Siegmund Levarie, who had earlier emigrated to live with an uncle in Chicago and would subsequently be a famous musicologist in the United States, arranged a visa for him and invited him to join him there. Kohut’s mother Else also emigrated to Chicago, travelling via Italy. With the money she had smuggled out of Austria, she opened a shop that she called “De Elsie’s”. Early days in Chicago Kohut was able to get his first position in the South Shore Hospital in Chicago, and in 1941 he began a residence in neurology at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital, where he lived and worked until 1948. He was certified in neurology in 1947. Around this time he apparently decided that he would have a Christian identity, and chose the Unitarian Church as his denomination. However, Kohut was not happy with neurology and it seems he was bored in this field. Too much of his time was spent in the laboratory and there was not enough contact with real human feelings. Career as a psychoanalystMoving into psychiatry and psychoanalysis= In late 1942 Kohut applied to the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, which had been founded by Franz Alexander in 1932, modelling it on the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute of the 1920s. Kohut was not accepted, and the rejection was decisive. The reason for this remains unclear, but Kohut was not even allowed to begin a didactic analysis. However, he found a clever way around this impasse by going into analysis, beginning in March 1943, with Ruth Eissler, who was a fellow Viennese and a fellow analysand of August Aichhorn and a training and supervising analyst at the institute. Furthermore, Ruth Eissler’s husband Kurt R. Eissler, also an analyst, was regarded by August Aichhorn as the most promising future leader of psychoanalysis in America. In 1944 Kohut decided to leave neurology and move into psychiatry, and in 1947 he was appointed associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. He got his certification psychiatry in 1949. In the fall of 1946 he had already been accepted to the Chicago Institute and began immediately on its courses. In the summer of 1947, he was given his first two “control” cases, followed by a third and a fourth case in early 1948. He began to receive patients on a permanent basis in 1949. In October 1950 he took his exams, passed them and became officially an analyst. He became a training and supervising analyst as well as a member of the institute’s staff in 1953. Unlike Franz Alexander, who had sought to shorten analyses, Kohut took as long as it took for the patients to get well in analysis. The agenda came entirely from the patient, whose job it was to say whatever occurred to him or her. He said to one of his patients: “I will do what I can to help you try and understand yourself.” He received his patients at the institute. All his patients are said to have adored him, although in the beginning of his career he had one case with which he failed miserably. Also, during the early years of his career as an analyst, his success was mixed. Kohut analyzed several persons, who were already analysts but who felt they had not benefited as much from their didactic analyses as they had hoped. Some did their training analyses with him. These persons included Peter Barglow, Michael Franz Basch, George Klumpner, Paul Tolpin. =Teacher of psychoanalysis= Kohut’s work in teaching at the institute became his primary commitment for the rest of his life. He soon became known as the most gifted and creative analyst in the Chicago Institute. Together with Louis Shapiro and Joan Fleming, he rewrote the curriculum of the institute and taught its two- year theory course for a decade. The course was not one of the history of psychoanalysis but a study of “psychoanalytic psychology presented according to historical principles.” It was a very Freudian course and contained no hints of where he would later move in his theoretical views. Kohut appeared as a master of metapsychology in these lectures. He later gave the course over to Philip Seitz, who had been auditing the course and had made notes of it that he had discussed with Kohut and then amended those notes in accordance of those discussions. This collaboration resulted in a joint article, entitled \\"Concepts and Theories of Psychoanalysis: Relation of Method and Theory\\" (1963). Seitz published his notes more than three decades later in the form of a book. Kohut's teaching style is said to have been brilliant, but at the same time it eclipsed the minds of the listeners, and according to Paul Ornstein who took the course, the style was pedagogically a failure. Other commentators have also said that Kohut’s brilliance made his students passive and did not encourage independent thinking. Kohut felt that analysts should be scientists and not technicians who just applied a set of rules to their work. If the latter were to be the case, the whole field of psychoanalysis would be assimilated to dynamic psychiatry and disappear forever. = Administrator in psychoanalysis= Kohut was active in the American Psychoanalytic Association from the 1950s. He served on the board of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, and in a number of committees. But in the 1960s he rose to the top of this organization. First he was its secretary during 1961–62, then president-elect during 1962–63, and finally the president during 1964–65. This further cemented his friendship with Kurt and Ruth Eissler. Kurt Eissler was now one of the leading figures of the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute. He also became friends with Heinz Hartmann, who was a very important figure for him. The last of these positions meant an incredible amount of work, preparing all kinds of meetings and working in a number of committees, as well as putting out all kinds of bush fires within the association. There was, for example, a question of whether analysts should or could express publicly their views about the mental health of Barry Goldwater. Kohut was at time very much a representative of traditional Freudian analysis, and he was very careful not to do anything that could have been interpreted as a departure from traditional views. He was also careful about “his reputation as the chosen one to provide leadership for the next generation of psychoanalysts.” Much later he jokingly said that in the 1950s and early 1960s he was “Mr. Psychoanalysis.” During this time Kohut became acquainted with everyone who mattered in psychoanalysis worldwide. For Kohut, the most important of these figures was Anna Freud. He first met her in 1964 in a meeting in Princeton. After that they were constantly writing to each other. In the fall of 1966 the University of Chicago gave Freud an honorary doctoral degree. Kohut may have been among the people who initiated this idea, and when she came to Chicago for this event, she stayed with the Kohuts in their apartment. Various activities were arranged for her in Chicago, and for Kohut this visit was a great success. In the long run Kohut began to feel that his work as the president drained his energies and kept him from developing his own ideas. He was also beginning to have ambivalent feelings about classical analysis. In addition, this position exposed him to people who were self- centered, full of themselves and narcissistic in the worst sense of the word. There was nothing wrong in the science of psychoanalysis, he felt, but the problem was in the people “who are carrying on their work on the basis of these ideas.” One could say that this was his higher education in matters related to narcissism. Since he left his position of the president of The American, Kohut was in 1965 elected vice-president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA). In 1968 he was encouraged by Anna Freud and the Eisslers to run for the presidency of this world-wide organization, as in 1969 it was the Americans’ turn to have their representative elected. In the end it turned out that the European members of IPA were beginning to favour Leo Rangell, and thus Kohut would not stand a chance in the election. Anna Freud advised him not offer himself for a defeat, and Kohut withdrew from the race. He then explained this situation to his colleagues by saying that the presidency would have interfered with his creative work, which was a self- invented myth that many colleagues duly bought. Had Kohut been elected, it would have been likely that his first monograph, The Analysis of the Self would have remained his only main contribution to psychoanalytic theory. =A writer within psychoanalysis=Early articles Beginning in 1946, Kohut’s friend Siegmund Levarie organized a series of concerts at the University of Chicago. In 1947, the response of the audience to a piece composed by Béla Bartók led him to write an article on some general principles of the psychology of music, which was published in 1950 in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly with the title “On the Enjoyment of Listening to Music.” Also in 1947 Kohut began to ponder Thomas Mann’s novella Death in Venice. In 1950 he wrote the final version of his thoughts on this novella and presented it as his graduation paper. He decided, however, not to publish it, as Mann was still alive. This article was finally published in 1957, also in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly, two years after Mann’s death. On empathy Kohut’s first truly scientific contribution was his 1959 article on empathy, entitled \\"Introspection, Empathy, and Psychoanalysis: An Examination of the Relationship Between Mode of Observation and Theory\\", which was written for the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis in November, 1957, and also presented by Kohut in a psychoanalytic congress in Paris the same year. This theme actually relates to the very foundation of psychoanalysis, the ability of one human being potentially to gain access to the psychological states of another human being. Interestingly, Sigmund Freud only mentioned this phenomenon in passing in a footnote in one of his articles (“A path leads from identification by way of imitation to empathy, that is, to the comprehension of the mechanism by means of which we are enabled to take up any attitude towards the life of another soul.” Kohut now took up the matter and gave a very thorough presentation on this subject, outlining what kind of subject matter can be approached with empathy and what cannot be approached with it. Essentially it means that empathy as a method defines the field that can be observed with its aid. The basic thesis is that those phenomena that can be approached by means of empathy are called psychological (i.e. relate to the inner life of man), and those that cannot be approached with it, are non-psychological, i.e. physical phenomena and must be approached with our sensory equipment. The approach thus is epistemological. Despite the warm reception of this paper in Chicago, it was initially turned down by the editors of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, on the grounds that it presented too basic a challenge to psychoanalytic theory and thus not appropriately psychoanalytic. After an intervention by Max Gitelson, who argued that the journal should engage itself in ideological censorship, the editorial board reconsidered the paper and eventually published it in 1959. Applied psychoanalysis In 1960 Kohut published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association an article entitled “Beyond the Bounds of the Basic Rule. Some Recent Contributions to Applied Psychoanalysis.” In it he deals with four psychoanalytic biographic works that had recently been published: *Phyllis Greenacre: Swift and Carroll, A Psychoanalytic Study of Two Lives (1955); *Edward Hirschmann: Great Men: Psychoanalytic Studies (1955); *Ida Macalpine and Richard A. Hunter, (ed.): Daniel Paul Schreber, Memoirs of my Nervous Illness (1955); *Editha Sterba and Richard Sterba: Beethoven and his Nephew. A Psychoanalytic Study of their Relationship (1954). With regard to using a psychoanalytic approach to works of art and to the lives of artists, Kohut lists three problems: *The scholar must have a solid grounding in both psychoanalysis and in the field under study. *The scholar is doing his study outside the traditional psychoanalytic situation, and thus without the benefit of the free association of the analysand. Furthermore, the person under study may have presented a false self in his artistic creations. *Often efforts in applied analysis are geared toward demonstrating the importance of psychoanalysis itself, and thus these studies have little relevance in the art form which is being studied and leaves itself open to critique of reductionism. On courage The article entitled “On Courage”, first published posthumously in 1985, is said to have been the most personal one Kohut wrote, with the exception of the article entitled “The Two Analyses of Mr. Z.” He examines here the actions of Franz Jägerstätter, Hans and Sophie Scholl during Hitler’s reign in Germany and their willingness of accept death as their only reward. According to Kohut, these people were not crazy, but “they represented a higher and deeper psychological truth that they reached in their actions. Their values gave them no other choice than to refuse to go along with the demands of the Nazi regime. Mitscherlich laudation Kohut spoke and wrote on the post-war psychological problems of the German people when he was invited to speak in Frankfurt am Main in October 1969. He was chosen as the laudator when the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade was awarded to Alexander Mitscherlich, with whom Kohut had become acquainted since the 1950s. Mitscherlich was a medical doctor and a psychoanalyst who had written several well received books on Germany’s guilt concerning World War II and the Holocaust. Kohut’s main thesis was that Mitscherlich had applied the “analytic principle of individual cure to the therapeutic transformation of a whole population.” The audience included the President of the Federal Republic of Germany Gustav Heinemann, and the speech was broadcast live to an estimated audience of 20–30 million people. Development of self psychology In the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, Freudian analysis focused on individual guilt and tended not to reflect the new zeitgeist (the emotional interests and needs of people struggling with issues of identity, meaning, ideals, and self-expression). Though he initially tried to remain true to the traditional analytic viewpoint with which he had become associated and viewed the self as separate but coexistent to the ego, Kohut later rejected Freud's structural theory of the id, ego, and superego. He then developed his ideas around what he called the tripartite (three-part) self. According to Kohut, this three-part self can only develop when the needs of one's “self states”, including one's sense of worth and well-being, are met in relationships with others. In contrast to traditional psychoanalysis, which focuses on drives (instinctual motivations of sex and aggression), internal conflicts, and fantasies, self psychology thus placed a great deal of emphasis on the vicissitudes of relationships. Kohut demonstrated his interest in how we develop our “sense of self” using narcissism as a model. If a person is narcissistic, it will allow him to suppress feelings of low self-esteem. By talking highly of himself, the person can eliminate his sense of worthlessness. The Self psychology movementThe beginnings= With the exception of such persons as Louis Shapiro and Jerome Kavka, Kohut’s peers were not receptive to his new ideas. However, younger analysts, such as Arnold Goldberg, Michael Franz Basch, Paul Ornstein, Anna Ornstein, Paul Tolpin, Marian Tolpin and Ernest Wolf and in the early days John Gedo were interested in his work, and David Marcus was also involved for a while. Goldberg eventually emerged as the central figure of the group, whereas Paul Ornstein would become the editor of Kohut’s collected works. Basch was the most original thinker of the group, but he chose to remain on its fringes. The group met originally in Kohut’s apartment in order to discuss his manuscript of what would become The Analysis of the Self. There were nine such meetings during the spring and early summer of 1969. The manuscript was considered to be difficult by the group, and the comments convinced Kohut that he had to write a new beginning to this book, which then became its first chapter, entitled “Introductory Considerations.” In reality this may actually have made the book even more difficult to digest than what it had been prior to the writing of this new first chapter. The Analysis of the Self The Analysis of the Self is Heinz Kohut’s first monograph, which was published in 1971. It is a treatise on narcissistic personality disorders, and on their psychoanalytic treatment. As his starting point, Kohut takes the conceptual separation of the self (German das Selbst) from the ego (German das Ich), which was done by Heinz Hartmann. Whereas the ego, the superego and the id are members of the psychic apparatus and thus agencies of the mind, the self is not an agency but still a content and a structure within the psychic apparatus.Kohut 1971, s. xiii–xv. The self contains two part structures, the grandiose self and the omnipotent object. These are structures that are found the development of all human individuals, the healthy as well as the disturbed. They have their own developmental line, which according to Kohut (at the time) was separate from the developmental line of object love. With the narcissistically disturbed people, this development has been thwarted, and the narcissistic structures have been repressed, and thus the narcissistic energies involved with them are not in the disposal of the subject. This results in low self-esteem and many diffuse symptoms, including possible perversions.Kohut 1971, s. 9. In the course of an analysis, these structures become activated and the patient is able to transform them. With some, the grandiose self will be dominant, resulting in what is called a mirror transference, and the patient expects to receive admiration from the analyst. With others, the omnipotent object is dominant, and in this case the patient directs an idealizing transference toward the analyst.Kohut 1971, s. 37–101. In a normal childhood as well as in analysis, these (re)activated structures enter the process of transmuting internalization, and what follows is that the grandiose self will turn into a set of ambitions and the omnipotent object into a set of ideals.Kohut 1971, s. 28, 175. The various other parties, such as the psychoanalyst, will be called selfobjects, because they are experienced as part of the self.Kohut 1971, s. xiv. Though dynamic theory tends to place emphasis on childhood development, Kohut believed that the need for such selfobject relationships does not end at childhood but continues throughout all stages of a person's life.Elson, Miriam. (1986). Self Psychology in Clinical Social Work Kohut presented his theory as a parallel to the drive theory and the theory of the Oedipus complex. The idea was to present a theory of a type of patients whose psychological disturbance preceded the emergence of the Oedipus complex. It had traditionally been considered that these patients were too disturbed to be treated psychoanalytically. With Kohut’s theory, the psychoanalytical treatment could now be extended to these patients as well. Between Analysis and Restoration In 1971, just after the publication of The Analysis of the Self, Kohut was diagnosed with lymphoma or lymphatic cancer. The cancer spread slowly but was mostly kept under control until 1977. Just when he had enjoyed the moment of greatest glory, he was confronted by a disease that was totally out of his control.Strozier 2001, p. 231–232. Due to his disease he would turn down most invitations to speak, including a chance to speak at Harvard University, and to deliver the Freud lecture in Vienna. He also gave up his talks at Princeton University, but he did speak regularly at the University of Cincinnati, which bestowed upon him an honorary degree in November 1973.Strozier 2001, p. 238. In 1973, a banquet was arranged for Kohut’s 60th birthday, which turned into a conference on self psychology. Among the participants were such people as Alexander Mitscherlich from Frankfurt, Paul Parin from Zurich and Jacques Palaci from Paris, as well as many psychoanalysts from the United States, including e.g. René Spitz from Denver. The distinguished historian of Vienna, Carl Schorske from Princeton was a featured speaker. The high point was a banquet, with John Gedo as the speaker. Kohut himself would respond to Gedo’s speech by delivering a speech which he had spent months preparing and which he had memorized and presented as a spontaneous response to Gedo. It was later published with the title “The Future of Psychoanalysis.”Strozier 2001, p. 239. In Strozier’s view, Kohut’s illness forced him to think for himself and resulted in several breakthroughs in his career as a theorist of psychoanalysis. He came to the conclusion that many analysts had been shaming their analysands in the guise of offering interpretations, that neurotic pathology was only a cover for narcissistic problems, that idealization was not a form of defense, that everyone needs mirroring, and that rage is a byproduct of the disintegration of the self. He broke free from classical metapsychology and formed his own, general psychology, with the self as its center. This would be self-psychology in its broad sense. The approaching death forced Kohut to think with his own brains. He knew that he was shaking psychoanalysis in its core, and he was afraid he would not have the time to finish his revolutionary job. By and large he stopped reading psychoanalytic literature, saying either that others say things better than him or that they write things that are no good. He devoted his time to his own writing, to listening to music and reading about the arts.Strozier 2001, p. 240–241, 243. =On narcissistic rage= In his book The Analysis of the Self, Kohut states that the topic of narcissistic rage will be taken up separately. This he did in the article “Thoughts on Narcissism and Narcissistic Rage”, which he published in 1972. In the article, Kohut wrote: The article was possibly a miscalculation, because he ought to have written on this topic in one of his monographs, which were more widely read than his articles. Due to this fact, criticism was leveled at him, saying that his views on aggression and rage were inadequate and naive and superficial at best.Strozier 2001, p. 249. For Freud, rage was a biological given that one needed to learn to curb. For him, wars, intolerance and repression were caused by a regression to a more primitive psychological level of the drives, from which our egos are separated only by a thin layer of civilization. For Kohut, neither the history nor the human soul could be explained by such reductionistic formulae. For him, rage was a byproduct of the disintegration of the self. For him, the rage one feels is in no proportion to the slight that has caused it. A person filled with rage does not feel any empathy towards the person or persons that have caused the slight.Strozier 2001, p. 249. According to Kohut,Kohut 1972, p. 635. Mature aggression, however, is goal oriented and limited in scope. Rage, on the other hand, consists of a desperate need for revenge, an unforgiving fury for righting a wrong, when one’s self has disintegrated due to an experienced slight.Strozier 2001, p. 250. Kohut published another important article in 1976, entitled “Creativeness, Charisma, Group Psychology. Reflections on the Self-Analysis of Freud”. He starts by making some comments on the psychoanalytic community, and then moves to Freud’s self-analysis and his relationship with Wilhelm Fließ, but in the end he writes about charismatic and messianic personalities. His examples of these are Hitler and Churchill.Kohut 1976, p. 793–843. The key concept in this article is the group self, which he puts forward in a tentative manner, as a “potentially fruitful concept”. Charismatic and messianic personalities evolve from childhood situations, in which the child has been given empathy at first, but then the mirroring and idealized figures have caused them “abrupt and unpredictable frustrations”. In result, the child has taken upon himself to perform the tasks of the selfobjects, developing a superempathy towards himself, while feeling next to no empathy and plenty of fury towards the outside world. He has begun to live in a decidedly archaic world filled with rage at the torment he suffered from his early selfobjects. He feels perfect himself, and asserts his perfection with self-righteousness, and demands control over others who would then serve as vicarious regulators of self-esteem. These people have special capabilities for sensitivity, Strozier 2001, p. 255.Kohut 1976, p. 834. =The group begins anew= After the publication of The Analysis of the Self the friendship between Kohut, on the one hand, and Anna Freud and Kurt Eissler, on the other, began to cool off slowly, as the latter began to understand the implications of Kohut’s work. Among Kohut peers, a notable exceptions to this pattern were René Spitz and Jerome Kavka. Most of his old friends shunned him. For example, Martin Stein from New York lambasted later Kohut’s 1977 book in the pages of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Kohut was even voted out of the board of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Strozier 2001, p. 269–272. In 1973, Kohut assembled again the group of his younger followers, inactive since 1969, to write what would be published as the so-called Casebook, officially The Psychology of the Self: A Casebook. Invited were John Gedo, Arnold Goldberg, Michael Franz Basch, Paul Ornstein and Anna Ornstein, Paul Tolpin and Marian Tolpin, Ernest Wolf, David Marcus and Meyer Gunther. However, Gedo soon left the group. The idea was that Kohut’s disciples were to write case histories of analyses which Kohut had supervised, and that Kohut would supply the book with his comments. The book was edited by Arnold Goldberg, but John Gedo left the group in 1974, and Kohut himself soon left the project as well, although it is said on the cover that it was “written with the collaboration of Heinz Kohut”. Strozier 2001, p.272–274. Kohut then assembled a smaller group which would meet in private homes. People from outside Chicago were also invited. This group would in 1978 evolve into annual conferences on self-psychology. Strozier 2001, p.276–277. The Restoration of the Self The title of Kohut’s second monograph is The Restoration of the Self. It was published in 1977. Kohut started to write this book in Carmel, California, during his summer vacation in 1974. By February 1975, he had written ca. “three quarters” of it, and by June he said it was soon to be completed. Its working title was a rather awful one, The Rehabilitation of the Self: Thoughts About the Termination of Analyses and the Concept of Cure. After the summer of 1975, he would say that the book was already finished. By October 1975, he had arrived at the final title, The Restoration of the Self. However, he carried on working on this book for the next year, and during this time he abandoned the awkward subtitle. The book was published in the spring of 1977, and it was an immediate success: by June it had sold 11.500 copies.Strozier 2001, s. 278. The Restoration of the Self is the best-written and most accessible book by Kohut. He tried as best he could to avoid the language of the drive theory as well as psychoanalytic metapsychology, which made his first book, The Analysis of the Self, such a difficult read. Kohut had decided to make his new book more accessible, and he worked together with Natalie Altman, his publisher’s editor, who would read and comment on his text. This work proceeded throughout the year 1976.Strozier 2001, s. 279. Restoration turned out to be Kohut’s breakthrough, the work in which he steps up from behind the curtain. He had abandoned the drive theory and its language, and he was never again to return to the mainstream Freudian psychoanalysis. Nearly all principles of psychoanalytic technique, inherited from Freud, were now in the line of fire: the drive theory, the central role of infantile sexuality, the Oedipus complex, the close relationship between conflicts, defenses and resistances, and working through. Kohut makes a clear break from Freudian thinking.Strozier 2001, s. 281–282. Kohut says that The Restoration of the Self is not a “is not a technical or theoretical monograph written detachedly by an author who has achieved mastery in a stable and established field of knowledge”. On the contrary, “it is a report of an analyst’s attempt to struggle toward greater clarity in an area that, despite years of conscientious effort, he was unable to understand within the available psychoanalytic framework.” He says he is “floundering in a morass of conflicting, poorly based, and often vague theoretical speculation,” and that the only way forward was to go “back to the direct observation of clinical phenomena and the construction of new formulations that would accommodate my observations.” He says he had tried to integrate his thoughts with those of previous thinkers, but thisKohut 1977, s. xx–xxi.Strozier 2001, p. 282–283. Kohut bypasses most authors in the field of psychoanalysis, but not Freud. He is in constant dialogue with him, and often finds himself contradicting him: Freud is no longer a relevant thinker from the point of view of history, or conceptually, therapeutically of philosophically. Kohut writes about the Tragic Man (his view of man) and the Guilty Man (Freud’s view of man), and Freud seems almost to suffocate Kohut. He struggles to breathe, and the “only salvation is that the struggle to breathe forces Kohut to clarify his ideas in ways that changed the field forever.”Strozier 2001, s. 283. For Freud the essence of psychoanalysis was that “neurotic misery would be transformed into common unhappiness”, and the unconscious would have to become conscious, repression barriers would have to be overcome, and light would have to penetrate the cauldron of desires, and the truth would have to be seen face to face, no matter what would follow from it. For Freud, Kohut’s idea that the psyche could be transformed into something new was “completely alien and exceedingly naïve.”Strozier 2001, s. 283–284. “In Freud’s early work with hysteria, Kohut argues, he probably cured mostly through suggestion and the mighty force of his belief in the rightness of his views,” writes Strozier. Healing was not Freud’s point. “Freud’s values were not primarily health values”, Kohut wrote. However, in Kohut’s view, “it is to Freud’s eternal credit that he created depth psychology.”Strozier 2001, s. 284. Kohut wanted to fundamentally question Freudian drive theory, and he understood that at the same time he would have to question the goals of Freudian analysts: “the mastering of infantile drives through more adaptive sublimations, making unconscious material conscious, and expanding and liberating the realm of the ego.” Very few of Kohut’s contemporaries understood that these goals originated from the drive theory. Challenging this paradigm was equal to an attack at the core of psychoanalysis.Strozier 2001, s. 288. The Two Analyses of Mr. Z. In 1977, at the age of 64, Kohut wrote an article that was to be entitled “The Two Analyses of Mr. Z.” This text was first intended for the German edition of The Restoration of the Self, where it would replace the case of “Mr. X.” The story is autobiographical, although Kohut himself never admitted this to anyone.Strozier 2001, p. 308. “Mr. X.” had originally been a case history by Anita Eckstaedt, a German analyst. Mr. X. was a German student of theology analyzed by Eckstaedt, but Kohut had disguised him as a young American man, who had wanted to join the Peace Corps but had been turned down. He had supposedly been analyzed in the US by Kohut’s younger colleague in supervision with him.Strozier 2001, p. 309. When the German edition of Restoration (Die Heilung des Selbst) was in preparation, Eckstaedt wrote to Kohut with two demands: (1) the case needed to be disguised further, and (2) Eckstaedt wanted to have more credit for the case. These demands were clearly mutually exclusive, resulting in a dilemma, which Kohut solved by writing up the case of Mr. Z., which replaced the case of Mr. X. in the German edition, which came out in 1979. Kohut later published the case in English in the International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, carefully edited by Natalie Altman.Strozier 2001, p. 309. Mr. Z. is presented as a patient that Kohut had analyzed twice for four years, first within a Freudian framework, and after an interval of five years, within Kohut’s new framework of self psychology. Both analyses lasted for five years.Strozier 2001, p. 311. Kohut did not discuss the case of Mr. Z. with his wife Elizabeth or his son Thomas, and he did not read out the article to them, something which he usually did with all his works. Elizabeth and Thomas did not really read the article until after Kohut’s death. The important facts of the life of Mr. Z., which coincide with Kohut’s life, are the following: He was an only child, his mother had similar character traits to Else Kohut, including her interest in painting and poetry. His father was away for a few years, before the son was five years of age, the story of a skiing vacation and the hotel there is similar to Kohut’s own life. The novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was read to him at an early age. There is a camp counselor that resembles a tutor that Kohut had had at an early age. The parents were distant with each other. However, some details are slightly changed. The father of Mr. Z. sits in with a small band and sings with them, when in reality Felix Kohut was an accomplished pianist.Strozier 2001, p. 310–311. There is no conclusive answer to whether Kohut was Mr. Z., but Strozier makes a strong case for it,Strozier 2001, p. 310–316. as does Cocks.Cocks 1994, p. 20. Strozier says that with such a prominent case for self psychology, it would have been highly likely that Kohut would not have used it until 1977, when he had already written two books on his theory. Personal life In 1948 Kohut presented case material in a seminar at the Chicago Institute, and one of the listeners was a social worker from the institute, Elizabeth Meyer. They fell immediately in love. For Kohut the decisive thing about her, as he wrote to Aichhorn, was her connection to Vienna. Meyer had spent some time in this city, had gone to analysis as Jenny Waelder’s patient and had also been Aichhorn’s student. They got married on October 9, 1948. They had one son, Thomas August Kohut (his first name being a reference to Mann, the middle name a reference to Aichhorn), born in 1950. After Thomas was born, Elizabeth Kohut gave up her day job at the institute, returning to work only in 1961 to work half days. The Kohuts also adopted informally the son of a colleague who had died and whose mother had committed suicide. Thomas Kohut studied at the University of Chicago Lab School and eventually went through psychoanalytic training, but then decided to make a career as a historian and a psychohistorian. Although Kohut enjoyed holiday trips to Europe, often in connection with psychoanalytic events, his favorite place for holidays was the town of Carmel in California. Beginning in 1951, the Kohuts usually spent two months there, from mid-July to mid-September. This way he could escape the hot and humid summers of Chicago, which caused him various problems due to his allergies. They always rented the same house, which was owned by an English couple that wanted to spend the summers in their native country. This house in Carmel is where Kohut did most of his writing. In addition to the holidays in Carmel, the Kohuts also had a country house in Wisconsin, where they could spend weekends, often during the winter. Kohut was psychologically unable to visit his native Vienna until 1957. He then visited his maternal uncle Hans Lampl, who had got back his old position as an executive of the Leykam-Josefsthal A.G. paper company. Lampl treated the Kohuts to a dinner, and used his position of influence to give a special gift to his nephew’s son. Kohut’s mother Else also lived in Chicago, not far from Kohut’s apartment. In the 1950s and 1960s she visited the Kohut family regularly for dinners and major holidays. She is said to have been the only person who could really get under Kohut’s skin. Apparently no one in the family liked her. She would be pushy and aggressive, speak directly at other people’s faces and poke people with her finger. After 1965, when Else was getting close to 75 years of age, she began to “demonstrate a set of circumscribed paranoid delusions.” This, together with her declining health, made it necessary for Kohut to place his mother in a nursing home in 1970. For Kohut, the fact that his mother had turned out to be crazy, was a liberating experience. He now realized that his whole life had been spent trying escape from his latently psychotic mother. He could now also understand why his father had been absent in his childhood. Strozier argues that Else’s craziness liberated Kohut’s creativity and made it possible for him to study the deeper meanings of highly regressed states and thus to write his first and most important monograph, The Analysis of the Self. Else Kohut died in late 1972. =Political views= Kohut was not a political person. According to his biographer Strozier, Kohut barely noticed the Nazis when they took over Vienna. In America, he was viewed as a liberal, and he was for state control of gun ownership. He considered the Vietnam War to be immoral and stupid, yet he did not initially understand his son’s anti-war attitude. Thomas Kohut was at the time studying at Oberlin College, which had a long history in opposing all kinds of social injustice, beginning with opposition to slavery and being an important station in the Underground Railroad. Eventually Kohut came to see reason in his son’s views, and their anti-Nixon sentiments presumably gave them some common ground. Death In the final week of his life, knowing that his time was at an end, Kohut spent as much time as he could with his family and friends. He fell into a coma on the evening of October 7, 1981, and died of cancer in Chicago on the morning of October 8.Charles B. Strozier. (2001). Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst.

Definition In materials of high atomic number (e.g. W, U, Pu) the electrons of energies >~10 MeV predominantly lose energy by bremsstrahlung, and high-energy photons by pair production. The characteristic amount of matter traversed for these related interactions is called the radiation length , usually measured in g·cm−2. It is both the mean distance over which a high- energy electron loses all but of its energy by bremsstrahlung , and of the mean free path for pair production by a high-energy photon. It is also the appropriate length scale for describing high-energy electromagnetic cascades. The radiation length for a given material consisting of a single type of nucleus can be approximated by the following expression: (http://pdg.lbl.gov/) X_0 = 716.4\\\\;\\\\mathrm g\\\\, \\\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\\\frac{A}{Z (Z+1) \\\\ln{\\\\frac{287}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}}} = 1433 \\\\;\\\\mathrm g\\\\, \\\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\\\frac{A}{Z (Z+1) (11.319 - \\\\ln{Z})}, where is the atomic number and is mass number of the nucleus.

While this definition may also be used for other electromagnetic interacting particles beyond leptons and photons, the presence of the stronger hadronic and nuclear interaction makes it a far less interesting characterisation of the material; the nuclear collision length and nuclear interaction length are more relevant.

Walker (born October 2, 1951) served as United States Comptroller General from 1998 to 2008, and is founder and CEO of the Comeback America Initiative (CAI) from 2010–2013. In 2017, Walker announced that he would explore running for Governor of Connecticut. He was eliminated from the race on the second round of voting at the State Republican Party Convention in May 2018. Early life and education Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1951.Congressional Staff Directory. He received his B.S. in accounting from Jacksonville University, a Senior Management in Government Certificate in public policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, his first honorary degree from Bryant University, and several other honorary doctorate degrees (American University, Jacksonville University, and Lincoln Memorial University). He is also a Certified Public Accountant and has completed the CAPSTONE program for flag rank military officers. Mr. Walker was employed by Arthur Andersen LLP (1989-1998), and was a Director at Source Finance.  Career as Comptroller General  David Walker served as Comptroller general of the United States from 1998-2008. He was appointed by Bill Clinton. While at the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Walker undertook a number of transformational reforms within the GAO and the government that were widely recognized. He also achieved two pieces of GAO- related legislation, one of which changed the name of the agency from the General Accounting Office to the Government Accountability Office. Walker embarked on a Fiscal Wake-up Tour, partnering with the Brookings Institution, the Concord Coalition, and the Heritage Foundation to alert Americans of the country's long-term fiscal imbalance. Walker left the GAO to head the Peterson Foundation on March 12, 2008. Labor-management relations became fractious at the end of Walker's nine-plus year tenure as Comptroller general. On September 19, 2007, GAO analysts voted by a margin of two to one (897–445), in a 75% turnout, to establish the first union in GAO's 86-year history. At the same time, despite controversy over GAO's internal reclassification effort, GAO employees rated the agency as the second best place to work in the federal government.  Peter G. Peterson Foundation  In 2008 Walker was personally recruited by Peter G. Peterson, co-founder of the Blackstone Group, and former Secretary of Commerce under Richard Nixon, to lead his new foundation. The Foundation distributed the documentary film, I.O.U.S.A.,I.O.U.S.A.: The Movie which follows Walker and Robert Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, around the nation, as they engage Americans in town-hall style meetings, along with luminaries such as Warren Buffett, Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, and Robert Rubin. Peterson was cited by The New York Times as one of the foremost \\"philanthropists whose foundations are spending increasing amounts and raising their voices to influence public policy\\". In philanthropy, Walker has advocated a more action-based approach to the traditional foundation: “I do believe, however, that foundations have been very cautious and somewhat conservative about whether and to what extent they want to get involved in advocacy.” David Walker stepped down as President and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation on October 15, 2010, to establish his own venture, the Comeback America Initiative.  Campaign for fiscal responsibility  Walker has compared the present-day United States to the Roman Empire in its decline, saying the U.S. government is on a \\"burning platform\\" of unsustainable policies and practices with fiscal deficits, expensive overcommitments to government provided health care, swelling Medicare and Social Security costs, the enormous expense of a prospective universal health care system, and overseas military commitments threatening a crisis if action is not taken soon.Grant, Jeremy, \\"Learn from the Fall of Rome, U.S. Warned\\", Financial Times, August 14, 2007.Allison, Tony, \\"The Boomers are Coming, The Boomers are Coming: Demographic Tsunami is at the Gate \\", Financial Sense Wrap-up, October 15, 2007. Walker has also taken the position that there will be no technological change that will mitigate health care and social security problems into 2050 despite ongoing discoveries. In the national press, Walker has been a vocal critic of profligate spending at the federal level. In Fortune magazine, he recently warned that \\"from Washington, we'll need leadership rather than laggardship\\". in another op-ed in the Financial Times, he argued that the credit crunch could portend a far greater fiscal crisis; and on CNN, he said that the United States is \\"underwater to the tune of $50 trillion\\" in long-term obligations. He compared the thrift of Revolutionary- era Americans, who, if excessively in debt, would \\"merit time in debtors' prison\\", with modern times, where \\"we now have something closer to debtors' pardons, and that's not good\\". In the fall of 2012, the Comeback America Initiative led a campaign called the \\"$10 Million a Minute\\" Bus Tour. The tour covered about 10,000 miles and stopped at universities, technical colleges, businesses, and more in over a dozen states. The tour's goal was to bring national attention to the economic and fiscal challenges that face our nation and various nonpartisan solutions that should be able to gain bipartisan support. Along with former Fed Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin, Walker danced the Harlem Shake in a video produced by The Can Kicks Back, a nonpartisan group that attempted to organize millennials to pressure lawmakers to address the United States' then $16.4 trillion debt.  Other responsibilities  Prior to his appointment to the GAO, Walker served as a partner and global managing director of Arthur Andersen LLP and in several government leadership positions, including as a Public Trustee for Social Security and Medicare from 1990 to 1995 and as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Pension and Welfare Benefit Programs during the Reagan administration. Before his time at Arthur Andersen, Walker was the Houston Director and then the Eastern Regional Director of Source Finance based in Washington, DC, and before that was in human resources at accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand. Walker serves on the board of the Government Transformation Initiative Coalition. He previously served on various boards and advisory groups, including as Chairman of the United Nations Independent Audit Advisory Committee from 2007 to 2011, as a member of the Boards for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, as well as a member of Advisory Committees for The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Peterson Foundation, and is a former member of the AARP's National Board and Policy Council. He is also a member of the National Academy for Public Administration, the National Academy of Social Insurance, the Trilateral Commission, and the Sons of the American Revolution. He is a National Co- Founder of No Labels previously served as Chair of a Postal Reform Panel for National Academy of Public Administration, and as Co-Chair of the Institute of Medicine's End of Life Panel. He has authored three books, with the most recent one titled Comeback America: Turning the Country Around and Restoring Fiscal Responsibility (2010), which was national bestseller. He is a frequent writer and commentator, and is one of the main subjects of the critically acclaimed documentary I.O.U.S.A.. Critic Roger Ebert named I.O.U.S.A. one of the Top 5 Documentaries of 2008.  Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut candidacy  In the 2014 election, Walker unsuccessfully sought to become the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut. In Connecticut, the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor run separately in the primary elections, but together as a ticket in the general election.  Governor of Connecticut candidacy On April 9, 2017, Walker announced that he would be establishing an exploratory committee to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Connecticut.https://dennishouse.tv/2017/04/09/walker-eyes- governors-office/ Walker pledged to support term limits for the office of governor and said that gubernatorial candidates should run as a ticket, so then voters know who would be their leaders. On May 14, 2018, Walker withdrew his candidacy for Governor, following a poor showing at the Republican state convention.http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-walker-handler- end-republican-campaigns-20180514-story.html/ A month later, on June 14, 2018 he endorsed businessman Bob Stefanowski.http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-pol-dave-walker- bob-stefanowski-endorsement-20180613-story.html/ Personal life He and his wife Mary live in Alexandria, VA, and have two children and three grandchildren. Awards Walker has received numerous leadership and public service awards. For example, Walker was awarded the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' highest award, the Gold Medal Award of Distinction on October 19, 2008. In 2010 Walker was inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame at The Ohio State University.  Books  * 1996. Retirement Security: Understanding and Planning Your Financial Future.

Unlike his father, Aedh did not favor cultivating diplomatic ties with the Normans. Even during his father's reign he led raids into Norman settlements and towns. When he became king, these raids continued.

Battle of Áth-an-Chip In 1269 Robert d'Ufford, the new justiciar in Ireland, began building a castle in Roscommon. His deputy led an army across the Shannon River, joining with their ally Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster. They held negotiations with Aedh which proved to be unsuccessful. They retreated, with Aedh's army harassing them along the way. When de Burgh attempted to forde the Shannon at Áth-an-Chip Aedh's army caught up with them and decimated them. Aedh followed up with more raids and destroyed the castle at Roscommon. Death Aedh died on 3 May 1274. There is no mention of Aedh's sons in the annals and he was succeeded by his brother Aedh Muimhnech as king. After Aedh's death the Kingdom of Connacht became embroiled in Civil War. Between 1274 and 1315 there were thirteen Kings of Connacht; nine of these kings were killed by a brother or cousin and two were deposed. This left Connacht weak and unable to resist the Norman invasion.

An entisol has no diagnostic horizons, and most are basically unaltered from their parent material, which can be unconsolidated sediment or rock. Entisols are the most abundant soil order, occupying about 16% of the global ice-free land area. In Australia, most Entisols are known as rudosols or tenosols. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), because of the diversity of their properties, suborders of Entisols form individual Reference Soil Groups: Psamments correlate with Arenosols and Fluvents with Fluvisols. Many Orthents belong to Regosols or Leptosols. Most Wassents and aquic subgroups of other suborders belong to the Gleysols.  Causes of delayed or absent development  * Unweatherable parent materials – sand, iron oxide, aluminium oxide, kaolinite clay. * Erosion – common on shoulder slopes; other kinds also important. * Deposition – continuous, repeated deposition of new parent materials by flood as diluvium, aeolian processes which means by wind, slope processes as colluvium, mudflows, other means. * Flooding or saturation. * Cold climate – must not be sufficiently cold in winter for permafrost. * Dry climate. * Shallow to bedrock – may be rock resistant to weathering, such as quartzite or ironstone. * Toxic parent materials – serpentine soil, mine spoils, sulfidic clays.  Suborders  *Aquents – permanently or usually wet soils formed on river banks, tidal mudflats etc. Here, general wetness limits development. *Fluvents – alluvial soils where development is prevented by repeated deposition of sediment in periodic floods. Found in valleys and deltas of rivers, especially those with high sediment load. *Orthents – shallow or \\"skeletal soils\\". Found on recent erosional surfaces or very old landforms completely devoid of weatherable minerals. *Psamments – Entisols that are sandy in all layers where development is precluded by the impossibility of weathering the sand. Formed from shifting or glacial sand dunes. *Wassents – Entisols that have a positive water potential at the soil surface for more than 21 hours of each day in all years. Paleopedology Most fossil soils before the development of terrestrial vegetation in the Silurian are Entisols, showing no distinct soil horizons. Entisols have been abundant in the paleopedological record ever since then, though, unlike other soil orders (Oxisols, Ultisols, Gelisols for instance) they do not have value as indicators of climate – though orthents might in some cases be indicated of an extremely old landscape with very little soil formation (as in Australia today).

It is an American history, which traces events from the Populist Movement of the 1890s through the Progressive Era to the New Deal of the 1930s. The Age of Reform stands out from other historical material because Hofstadter's main purpose for writing is not to retell an extensive history of the three movements, but to analyze the common beliefs of the reform groups in our modern perspective to elucidate historical distortions, most notably between the New Deal and Progressivism. Alan Brinkley, \\"Richard Hofstadter's The Age of Reform: A Reconsideration\\". Reviews in American History. Vol. 13, No. 3 (September 1985) pp. 462–480.Robert D. Johnston, \\"'The Age of Reform': A Defense of Richard Hofstadter Fifty Years On,\\" Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era 6#2 (2007), pp. 127-137 Contents Hofstadter organizes The Age Of Reform chronologically, beginning with Populism. The key concept he introduces is \\"the agrarian myth,\\" the representation of the homage Americans have paid to the subsistence, innocent, and yeoman farmer of old. The myth became a stereotype since agriculture became more commercial and industrial. Populism's main cause for formation was the alleged loss of \\"free land.\\" Many Populist leaders believed that industry and government had a vendetta to destroy the agricultural business. The last chapter on Populism explains the agricultural prosperity after the Populist revolt because city migration lessened competition that had caused farmers to organize for the first time. Hofstadter highlights the foibles in the Populist revolt. The first was its sectional appeal, rather than national. Also, he argues its leaders were incompetent and that there was a perennial lack of funds. However, the single most destructive weakness was lack of silver. By joining with the Democratic campaign of 1896 on silver, Populists lost political ground. Despite their dissolution, Populists were successful because they caused the passage of new laws, years later. The next major reform movement was Progressivism. The two groups of Populism and Progressivism shared many philosophies, but the latter was widely accepted because it was not seen by the majority as anarchically. The causes for Progressivism were the status revolution in the post-American Civil War era (\\"new money\\" supplanted \\"old money\\" prestige), the alienation of professionals, and the introduction of the Mugwump. The urban scene during the Progressive era, as argued by Hofstadter, provided little support for the Progressive movement because immigrants cared not for reforms but for democracy in general. Hofstadter provides evidence from numerous sources of the general nativism possessed by Progressives. As a corollary of the growing urban scene, aggressive newspaper reporters, named muckrakers, emerged. The Progressive journalists multiplied as new styles of magazines appeared. The last chapter focused on enemies of Progressives like trusts, unions, and political machines. Leaders expressed the need for entrepreneurship, individualism, and moral responsibility rather than organization. The final section stretches from Progressivism's end to the New Deal. Reformists have an interesting relationship with wars in that the aftermath of war is usually a time of conservatism, as was the case after World War I, which heralded the death of Progressivism. The New Deal was a culmination of both Populism and Progressivism; however, Hofstadter stresses that for the most part, the New Deal was a \\"new departure\\" and despite its continual association with Progressivism, it was quite dissimilar. The reason it was different is that the New Deal was born out of the Great Depression, not prosperity, as were Populism and Progressivism. The New Deal was concerned with not democratizing the economy but managing it to meet the problems of the people. The New Deal had no set plans of reform; it was a chaotic experiment. Old Progressive woes were ignored. Party bosses were left alone. The New Deal did not intercede between the public and big business because the public wanted economic restoration, not regulation. A major disparity between Progressivism and the New Deal was that the latter was not based on Protestant morality and responsibility but was more pragmatic. It did not use moral rhetoric to create changes but physically acted. Critics Some of Hofstadter's arguments have since been attacked by defenders of Populism historians, including Norman Pollack, C. Vann Woodward, and Lawrence Goodwyn. They argue that Hofstadter's misunderstandings include the fact that the Populists were not simply incipient capitalists trying to reform but instead forward-looking radicals, who sought a democratized industrial system and a transformation of social values in order to help the individual protect his humanity as his autonomy slipped away from him in a rapidly industrializing society.For a defense of Hofstadter's position on Populists see Johnston, \\"'The Age of Reform': A Defense of Richard Hofstadter Fifty Years On.\\" The Progressives, according to Robert Wiebe and others in the \\"modernization school\\" were made up not of status revolutionaries from the old guard or disaffected professionals but were in a new class of educated professionals who came of age in the new interconnected modernizing world. They not only understood how to navigate the new bureaucracy by creating symbiotic relationships between government, education, and business but also pressed through \\"reforms\\" that did away with the old \\"local\\" way of doing business by enacting civil service reforms replacing elected officials with appointed \\"experts.\\" NotesReferences *Brinkley, Alan. \\"Richard Hofstadter's The Age of Reform: A Reconsideration\\".

They are distinguished from territorial parishes that serve the French-speaking majority, and also from Eastern-rite parishes that serve ethnic communities associated with Eastern Catholic Churches, such as Ukrainians. Québec was first colonized by French explorers who brought to North America the Roman Catholic religion. English Protestants began arriving after the Conquest of 1760 and during the American Revolution (1776–1783). They established their own churches and charitable societies. The immigration of many Irish Catholics during the early nineteenth-century brought about a pastoral problem. No anglophone parishes existed in Québec at the time and few preachers could minister to the immigrants' spiritual needs. The Irish Quebecers successfully demanded the creation of English-speaking parishes. By the mid-1840s, they had also erected Saint Patrick's Basilica, a decade after the French Notre-Dame de Montreal Basilica was completed. Thus came to be born the national parishes of Québec. This manner of church organization is unique in Canada. All parishes are in full communion with the local bishop. Parish boundaries are set by episcopal decree and the territories of the parishes of different nationalities overlap. Members of a certain ethnic or linguistic group in a given area are understood to belong only to their national parish. Thus, the English and French of one district may belong to two distinct parishes with the same territory. Nevertheless, no parish is officially subordinate to another (or bound by another's decisions), though certain have achieved greater renown than others. English national parishes are quite numerous and are found throughout Québec. Parishes were also erected for the Italians, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Chinese communities of Montreal, among others. The oldest allophone parish in Canada is the Italian Madonna del Carmine (\\"Our Lady of Mount Carmel\\", ), created in 1905 by Msgr Paul Bruchési. Alongside Madonna della Difesa (\\"Our Lady of La Difesa\\", ), it enjoys particular prestige in the Italian community on account of its age. Though Mass is celebrated in languages besides English and French outside of greater Montreal, no allophone national parishes exist outside this region--few allophone immigrants chose to settle elsewhere. Due to their smaller number, the territories of allophone national parishes are usually much larger than the territories of English national parishes. Besides language, the national parishes keep alive through their celebrations different Church traditions and customs particular to certain countries, for instance, saints' feast days or devotional observances. Many of these parishes are headed by priests who studied in or emigrated from those countries.

When Count William III of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn died in 1623 without clear heirs, the Archbishop of Cologne occupied the vacant County until the succession was settled. It was settled by treaty in 1648, when the County was given jointly to Princesses Ernestine and Johanette, two sisters who were granddaughters of Count William, and their mother Dowager Countess Louise Juliane made regent. But shortly after the treaty, the County was split between the two. Ernestine's portion was called Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hachenburg (or Sayn-Hachenburg for short), a title which descended through the female line and is now a title of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Johanette's was Sayn- Wittgenstein-Sayn-Altenkirchen. Their mother remained regent for both Counties until 1652, when Johanette and Ernestine separately ruled their respective Counties. Sayn-Altenkirchen was inherited by Duke Johann William of Saxe- Eisenach — Johanette's son — and secondly by Duke William Henry of Saxe- Eisenach — Johanette's grandson. William Henry died childless and Sayn- Altenkirchen was inherited by Charles, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Johanette's great-grandson.

It uses a quiz-bowl format, with lockout buzzers and extended team challenge questions to test students on their knowledge of oceanography. This includes the subjects of biology, chemistry, geology, geography, social science, technology, and physics. The annual competition was started in 1998, the International Year of the Ocean. The current director of NOSB is Kristen Yarincik, who is based out of Washington, DC. Currently there are 25 regions in the U.S. that compete in the NOSB, each with their own regional competitions. The regional competitions are coordinated by the Regional Coordinators, who are typically affiliated with a university in their region. Each year approximately 2,000 students from 300 schools across the nation compete for prizes and a trip to the national competition. The goal of this organization is to increase knowledge of the ocean among high school students and, ultimately, magnify the public understanding of ocean research.

Teams have 5 seconds to buzz in and answer the question. If the first team's answer is incorrect, the opposing team will get another 5 seconds to answer. The team that buzzes in first gets to answer the question. A correct answer wins the team 4 points and the right to attempt a bonus question. No conferring is allowed on toss-ups. If a player buzzes in before a moderator finishes reading the question, the buzz is called an interrupt. An incorrect answer will cause the team to lose 4 points and the question to be re-read to the opposing team. This is the only situation in which a team can lose points. However, no points are lost for incorrect answers that are not interrupts. If a player begins an answer before being verbally recognized by the moderator, this is called a blurt. The answer is ignored (not indicated correct or incorrect by the moderator) and the question is re-read to the opposing team. There is no point penalty for a blurt, but the team that blurted is disqualified from answering that question. * Bonus: These are short answer questions that only the team that correctly answered the previous toss-up may answer. Teams have 20 seconds to confer and answer this question. The team captain must begin the team's answer before time is called. A correct response is awarded with an additional 6 points. * Team Challenge Question (TCQ): Each Team Challenge Question is an essay-type question worth up to 20 points, with partial credit awarded if necessary. Time ranges from 2 to 5 minutes for a challenge question, and the topics can be anything related to oceanography. A single NOSB match consists of two 6-minute buzzer rounds with two Team Challenge Questions in between. Each round is made up of 20 questions pairs. After the break, the second half begins with the first toss-up that was not read in the first half and continues until time expires or all questions have been read. The most points a team can earn each round is 240 points (20 toss-ups and bonuses each plus full-credit on the two TCQs), but earning 100 or more points is considered very impressive. Teams may make substitutions only during the break.

She started synchronised swimming at the age of 12 in early 1997. A few months later, her coach retired and Sara stopped swimming. But later that year she was invited to join several other girls for a training stint for a few months in Canada for an upcoming national competition. By mid-1998 she had joined the synchronised swimming National Team of Malaysia. Her first competition where she represented her country was at the World Youth Games in Moscow, Russia in the team and figures category. She later participated in a duet category as a demonstrator for synchronised swimming at the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In 2000, she participated in the Olympic Qualification Tournament held in Sydney, Australia in the duet category where she placed 31st and did not qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics. She also participated in her first ever FINA World Championships held in Fukuoka, Japan in the duet category where she placed 23rd with a score of 75.931. She won a gold medal at the 2001 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur with Suzanna Ghazali. Then, leading up to the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, it was thought that Sara was likely to win the bronze medal in the duet category. She had spent months in Vancouver, Canada training with one of Canada's seven national coaches, where her performances suggested the bronze. Her technical and free duet routines were tougher, better choreographed and executed than those of the Australian routines, but to the surprise of many the Australian duet gained higher marks from the judges. She placed fourth with a total score of 80.500, her personal best to that time. In 2003, Sara participated in her second FINA World Championships but did not fulfill expectations, scoring low again, placing 30th of 34 in her duet technical and 26th in duet free routine/overall. Her best finish/scoring in her third Sukma Games (Pan Malaysian National Games) in Paroi, Negeri Sembilan was first in the team and duet events. She scored marks ranging from 7s and 8s for the team event and an all 8s marks for her duet event which is the first time she has ever done so, with a total score for her duet event of 84.000, her competition personal best.

Since their formation in 1994, they have been a staple of the Montreal music scene. During the third wave of ska, they performed nationally and later internationally, with tours in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Founding member Matt Collyer helped establish Stomp Records in 1994, which featured many ska and ska punk bands, including Montreal's The Kingpins, The Flatliners, The Know How, and Bedouin Soundclash.\\"PIONNIERS DU PUNK-ROCK QUÉBÉCOIS: Que sont-ils devenus ?\\". La Presse, Émilie Côté, 20 May 2016. Their music has been used in the Japanese flash series Catman, Canadian show Radio Free Roscoe, and MTV's Undergrads (shown on Teletoon in Canada). Lyrics by The Planet Smashers often deal with topics such as love, partying and good times, and sometimes use tongue-in-cheek innuendo. HistoryEarly years (1992–1993)= The name \\"The Planet Smashers\\" was first used in 1992 for a band including Matt Collyer, Ceco Munaretto, Andrew Conway and Dave Jones. The original group played punk, ska, and rock inspired by the \\"Manchester sound.\\" The group primarily focused on live shows although it did record one demo (\\"The Road Song\\") at a Montreal studio, and one live performance (Station 10 in Montreal, October 1992). The songs \\"Coolest Guy\\" and \\"Vampire,\\" among others, come from this period. The group briefly disbanded in 1993 - largely because its drummer had vanished. =First lineup (1993–1996)= The band was reformed in late 1993 by original members, Collyer and Munaretto. The two decided to introduce horns into the band and focus on ska. Travis Wilkinson (Trombone) was attracted to the band by a misleading poster that read \\"Its' your big break, goofball trombone player needed for ska band that's huge in Belgium with confirmed European tour.\\" The other original members were Dave Cooper (Drums) and Andrew Skowronski (Tenor Saxophone). They practiced in the McGill University music department until they were kicked out and their first gig was at the now defunct \\"Station 10\\" on March 17, 1994.\\"PIONNIERS DU PUNK-ROCK QUÉBÉCOIS: Que sont-ils devenus ?\\". La Presse, Émilie Côté, 20 May 2016. The band played small Montreal venues, including \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Jailhouse\\" and at ska festivals. All the band members contributed original material and sets included some ska/punk cover tunes. A first demo of three songs was recorded in Cooper's apartment but not released. Later the band recorded their first cassette in a weekend session, using studio time won by one of Collyer's defunct former bands \\"The Thrill Killers\\". The quality of this recording was not very high, but it helped get the band more gigs and visibility, including shows outside of Montreal. Popular destinations for the band included the Toucan in Kingston, The Pit in Ottawa, and Sneaky Dees in Toronto. The band was an important part of the vibrant local ska scene that existed in Montreal in the mid-90s. The self-titled CD was recorded in spring 1995; because of a tight budget it was produced and recorded by the band in Dave's apartment on a 12 track tape recorder. This album includes favorites like \\"Pee in the Elevator\\" and \\"Janice\\". The band had its first cross-country tour promoting its release in the summer of 1995. In 1996 the band's summer tour extended into the United States. The band suffered mishaps like a broken saxophone, multiple van breakdowns, and an issue at the border that prevented Travis from completing the tour. After a few more shows in Montreal the original lineup broke up, with Ceco, Andrew and Travis leaving the band. =1997–present= The Planet Smashers have continued, with Collyer and Cooper remaining as core members and a series of new members and sidemen. Cooper switched from drums to bass guitar when Tim Doyle joined the band. The band often plays all-ages shows and the playful lyrics and the high energy music has proven popular with teenage listeners. The band is one of the most popular ska bands in Canada and continues to tour and perform. For the past decade or so, the band's lineup has primarily consisted of Matt Collyer, Dave Cooper, Scott Russell, Alexandre Fecteau, Patrick Taylor, and most recently, keyboardist Patrizio McLelland was added to the band. The Planet Smashers released Descent Into the Valley of the Planet Smashers on July 12, 2011. They continue to play shows bi-monthly limited to the Quebec and Ontario area due to Matt's busy schedule with his children and family. Their eighth studio album, titled Mixed Messages, was released April 8, 2014 via Stomp Records. They released a video for the single \\"Tear It Up\\" featuring the members of the Montreal Roller Derby league. In 2019 their ninth studio album, Too Much Information, was released. This is the first album to feature keyboardist Patrizio McLelland and second album to feature trombonist Patrick Taylor. The band continues to tour Canada and plays sporadic dates in the United States with Andy McAdam filling in on bass for Dave Cooper.

When the switch is closed, the input voltage at the gate goes to ground. In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. It is typically used in combination with components such as switches and transistors, which physically interrupt the connection of subsequent components to ground or to VCC. When the switch is closed, it creates a direct connection to ground or VCC, but when the switch is open, the rest of the circuit would be left floating (i.e., it would have an indeterminate voltage). For a switch that connects to ground, a pull-up resistor ensures a well-defined voltage (i.e. VCC, or logical high) across the remainder of the circuit when the switch is open. Conversely, for a switch that connects to VCC, a pull-down resistor ensures a well-defined ground voltage (i.e. logical low) when the switch is open. An open switch is not equivalent to a component with infinite impedance, since in the former case, the stationary voltage in any loop in which it is involved can no longer be determined by Kirchhoff's laws. Consequently, the voltages across those critical components (such as the logic gate in the example on the right) which are only in loops involving the open switch are undefined, too. A pull-up resistor effectively establishes an additional loop over the critical components, ensuring that the voltage is well-defined even when the switch is open. For a pull-up resistor to serve only this one purpose and not interfere with the circuit otherwise, a resistor with an appropriate amount of resistance must be used. For this, it is assumed that the critical components have infinite or sufficiently high impedance, which is guaranteed for example for logic gates made from FETs. In this case, when the switch is open, the voltage across a pull-up resistor (with sufficiently low impedance) practically vanishes, and the circuit looks like a wire connected to VCC. On the other hand, when the switch is closed, the pull-up resistor must have sufficiently high impedance in comparison to the closed switch to not affect the connection to ground. Together, these two conditions can be used to derive an appropriate value for the impedance of the pull-up resistor but usually, only a lower bound is derived assuming that the critical components do indeed have infinite impedance. A resistor with low resistance (relative to the circuit it's in) is often called a \\"strong\\" pull-up or pull-down; when the circuit is open, it will pull the output high or low very quickly (just as the voltage changes in an RC circuit), but will draw more current. A resistor with relatively high resistance is called a \\"weak\\" pull-up or pull-down; when the circuit is open, it will pull the output high or low more slowly, but will draw less current. Applications A pull-up resistor may be used when interfacing logic gates to inputs. For example, an input signal may be pulled by a resistor, then a switch or jumper strap can be used to connect that input to ground. This can be used for configuration information, to select options or for troubleshooting of a device. Pull-up resistors may be used at logic outputs where the logic device cannot source current such as open-collector TTL logic devices. Such outputs are used for driving external devices, for a wired-OR function in combinational logic, or for a simple way of driving a logic bus with multiple devices connected to it. Pull-up resistors may be discrete devices mounted on the same circuit board as the logic devices. Many microcontrollers intended for embedded control applications have internal, programmable pull-up resistors for logic inputs so that not many external components are needed. Some disadvantages of pull-up resistors are the extra power consumed when current is drawn through the resistor and the reduced speed of a pull-up compared to an active current source. Certain logic families are susceptible to power supply transients introduced into logic inputs through pull-up resistors, which may force the use of a separate filtered power source for the pull-ups. Pull-down resistors can be safely used with CMOS logic gates because the inputs are voltage-controlled. TTL logic inputs that are left un-connected inherently float high, and require a much lower valued pull-down resistor to force the input low. A standard TTL input at logic \\"1\\" is normally operated assuming a source current of 40 μA, and a voltage level above 2.4 V, allowing a pull-up resistor of no more than 50 kohms; whereas the TTL input at logic \\"0\\" will be expected to sink 1.6 mA at a voltage below 0.8 V, requiring a pull-down resistor less than 500 ohms. Holding unused TTL inputs low consumes more current. For that reason, pull-up resistors are preferred in TTL circuits. In bipolar logic families operating at 5 VDC, a typical pull-up resistor value will be 1000–5000 Ω, based on the requirement to provide the required logic level current over the full operating range of temperature and supply voltage. For CMOS and MOS logic, much higher values of resistor can be used, several thousand to a million ohms, since the required leakage current at a logic input is small.

Service history1775= In October 1775, Colonel John Glover, acting for General George Washington, chartered the schooner Two Brothers from Thomas Stevens of Marblehead, Massachusetts, as a replacement for . Her complement complete, 28 October, Captain John Manley dropped her down with the tide, lay to off Tuck Point, and headed out to sea the next morning. On 27 November, the vessel, now known as Lee, took her first prize, the 80 ton sloop Polly carrying turnips and Spanish-milled dollars from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to the British troops at Boston, Massachusetts. After sending Polly into Beverly under a prize crew, Lee sailed off Boston, and at dusk the next day gave chase to the 250-ton brig Nancy, then beating her way into Boston. Mistaking Lee for a pilot boat, Nancy laid her sails aback and sent up a string of signal flags. Captain Manley dispatched a boat with carefully picked men, ordering them to conceal their weapons as they rowed to and boarded Nancy. Taken by surprise, the brig surrendered without resistance, providing the Americans with a precious cargo of ordnance and gunpowder. Manley placed a prize crew in Nancy and accompanied her to Beverly. Early in December, Lee was again giving chase intercepting the 200-ton ship Concord laden with drygoods and coal. After capture, Concord was escorted into Marblehead Harbor. The next month Capt. Daniel Waters relieved Captain Manley. =1776= On 29 January 1776, while operating with , Lee took the 60-ton sloop Rainbow, carrying wood, potatoes, spruce beer, and meat. The next day the American schooners and their prize were sighted by the British frigate . After a fast chase, the Americans eluded the frigate and, with their prize, reached safety in Cape Ann Harbor. Lee and Franklin soon slipped out to sea again, taking the 300-ton, Boston-bound brigantine Henry and Esther, carrying military cargo, northeast of Cape Ann on 1 February. Early in March, and joined Lee and Franklin off Cape Ann. On the night of the 4th, the schooners drove off British brig Hope in a spirited engagement. The next day they took Susannah, a 300-ton British merchantman laden with coal, cheeses, and porter for General William Howe's beleaguered army in Boston. After escorting their prize to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the squadron, commanded by Captain Manley in Lee, returned to Cape Ann, where on the 10th they captured another ship, the 300-ton transport Stokesby, bound for Boston with porter, cheese, vinegar, and hops. En route to Gloucester, the prize ran aground. After much of her cargo had been removed, British brig Hope arrived and put the torch to the hulk. While Manley's squadron was at Gloucester, General Howe evacuated Boston and General Washington ordered his ships to dog the British Fleet, pouncing on any stragglers. The patriot schooners departed Gloucester, 21 March, and sighted a merchant brig off Boston Light that afternoon. They chased their prey and by evening were close enough to open fire. Their quarry then hove to, but two British men-of-war, Savage and Diligent, arrived to compel the American schooners to abandon their prize. Soon afterwards, Manley divided his squadron, keeping Lynch and Lee with Hancock. On the afternoon of 2 April, they sighted the brig Elizabeth. This prize, an American vessel captured by the British the previous October, was filled with loot plundered from the warehouses of patriot Bostonian merchants and carried a number of Tory refugees. Many of the Tories were transferred to Lee, while their leaders were taken on board Hancock, and the captive crew imprisoned in Lynch, which accompanied Hancock into Portsmouth. On 13 May, Lee, operating with off Cape Ann, was joined by Lynch. A fortnight later pursued the schooners, but they escaped in fog. On 7 June, they captured the British transport Anne, carrying a light infantry company of the 71st Regiment and some forty sailors sent out as fleet replacements. Sixty of the Highlanders were transferred to Lynch and taken to Plymouth, the remainder and the sailors were divided between Lee and Warren, which then escorted Anne toward Marblehead, outrunning the British frigate Milford to safety. Lee next cruised alone off Nova Scotia without success until recapturing Betsy, after that sloop had fallen prey to Milford in Massachusetts Bay. Lee scored again in early November by taking the brig Elizabeth, escorting her into Boston on the 7th. While Lee was in port, Captain Waters left the ship to journey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a Member of Congress. He was succeeded by Capt. John Skinner. =1777= Early in the spring of 1777, Lee was again underway from Boston. She took the schooner Hawke, 13 April, captured the fishing sloop Betsy, 3 May, and, a week later, caught the Irish brigantine Charles. The latter, laden with fish, was recaptured en route to Boston under a prize crew. Soon the brigantines Capelin and Industry were added to the list of prizes and escorted to Casco Bay to be libeled. Lee then continued on to Boston, arriving 25 June. Meanwhile, the ranks of General Washington's Navy were being thinned by captures. When Lynch struck her colors on 19 May 1777, Lee was the only schooner of the little fleet left in operation. She pushed out into the Atlantic, 24 July. On 29 August she caught the brig Industrious Bee and sent her into Boston. The next day, she took the snow Lively, but that prize was recaptured by the frigate Diamond, 23 September. Lee next turned south and took her final prize, the brigantine Dolphin, before returning to Marblehead, 26 October 1777. A few days later, she was returned to her owner.

A resolution of the Continental Congress of British North America 13 December 1775 authorized her construction; she was named for John Hancock. In her career she served under the American, British and French flags. As Hancock Hancock was built at Newburyport, Massachusetts, and placed under command of Captain John Manley 17 April 1776. After a long delay in fitting out and manning, she departed Boston, Massachusetts On 21 May 1777 in company with Continental frigate and the Massachusetts privateer American Tartar for a cruise in the North Atlantic. American Tartar parted from the two frigates shortly thereafter. On 29 May the frigates captured a small brig loaded with cordage and duck. The next day they encountered a convoy of transports escorted by British 64-gun ship which set sail to close Hancock. Manley was saved by clever and well-timed action of Boston, which forced Somerset to give up the chase by taking on the transports. After escaping from Somerset, the two frigates sailed to the northeast until 7 June when they engaged the Royal Navy's 28-gun frigate , which tried to outsail her American enemies. Hancock gave chase and soon overhauled Fox, which lost her mainmast and suffered other severe damage in the ensuing duel. About an hour later, Boston joined the battle and compelled Fox to strike her colors. Hancock spent the next few days repairing the prize and then resumed cruising along the coast of New England. East of Cape Sable she took a British coal sloop which she towed until the next morning when the approach of a British squadron prompted Manley to set the coal sloop ablaze and leave her adrift. The British frigate HMS Flora recaptured Fox after a hot action. Boston became separated from Hancock, which tried to outsail her pursuers. Early in the morning 8 July 1777 the British were within striking distance. began to score with her bowchasers and followed with a series of broadsides. Hancock was thus finally forced to strike her colors after a chase of some 39 hours. She had 239 men of her crew aboard, 50 some being on Fox. She also had Captain Fotheringham of Fox and 40 of his people on board. The rest were on Boston and a couple of fishing vessels. As HMS Iris Hancock, renamed Iris, served the British Navy so effectively that her new owners boasted of her as \\"the finest and fastest frigate in the world.\\" On 21 and 23 April 1780 Iris, , and captured the American privateers Amazon, '\\"General Wayne, and Neptune. The capture had taken place a few leagues from Sandy Hook and Iris and Delaware brought them into New York on 1 May. The most famous of the many prizes which made her officers wealthy men was the capture on 28 August 1781 of the American 28-gun ship . Trumbull carried 32 guns and 200 men. Iris captured her after an engagement of about an hour in which Iris lost one man killed and six wounded, while Trumbull had two men killed and 10 wounded. In the aftermath of the Battle of the Chesapeake, admirals Graves and Hood left the Chesapeake waters; the French set a solid screen of fast frigates to intercept enemy shipping. Prior to retreating, Hood dispatched two frigates, Iris and Richmond, to General Cornwallis in Yorktown. On 9 September 1781, four French frigates intercepted them; Richmond fell back and surrendered first, then the French frigate Aigrette, under captain Traversay, captured Iris. Traversay boarded Iris, assumed command and held it till the end of war. As Royal French Iris On 4 November 1781, Iris, with the main French fleet, sailed from Annapolis to the Antilles. In January 1782 Iris took part in the Battle of St. Kitts. Iris captured a small British sloop. On the eve of Battle of the Saintes Admiral de Grasse detached Iris to convoy unarmed troop transports; Iris completed her mission. In the late stages of the war Iris continued reconnaissance and cruising, and finally performed a diplomatic mission when she carried an offer of a ceasefire to British-occupied New York.

Life All that we know about Damis comes from Apollonius' biographer Philostratus who wrote his Life of Apollonius of Tyana between 217 and 238. Some scholars believe the notebooks of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone else and used by Philostratus. And some scholars think that Damis never existed at all. F.C. Conybeare, however, points out the extreme and unnecessary sceptism of this theory.F.C. Conybeare, Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, the Epistles of Apollonius and the Treatise of Eusebius (1912), introduction, page vii E. Rabinovitch even advocates a high probability of the real existence of Damis' notebooks.E. G. Rabinovitch, Flavius Philostratus and his hero, p. 217-247 in Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana , Nauka, Moscow, 1985 It is possible that Philostratus did use a biography of Apollonius by Damis, who was however, not trustworthy (that is, he was like the so-called aretalogi, sought to embellish the life of his master).F.C. Conybeare, Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, the Epistles of Apollonius and the Treatise of Eusebius (1912), introduction, page vii-viii) According to Philostratus, Apollonius met Damis in a city which Philostratus calls \\"Old Ninos\\", which from its location cannot be Nineveh, but is in fact the \\"holy city\\" of Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria.Christopher P. Jones: Apollonius of Tyana's Passage to India, in: Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 42 (2001) p. 185-199, especially p. 187-190. Damis admired Apollonius so much that he became his disciple, and kept a record of Apollonius' actions and sayings, the so-called Memoirs (or Diary) of Damis. These notes came into the possession of the empress Julia Domna, and it was she who commissioned Philostratus to write a biography of Apollonius, the extant Life of Apollonius of Tyana. That's what Philostratus asserts. Damis is also a common name in Arcadian pastorals, and that of Orgon's son in Molière's Tartuffe. It is also the name of the keeper of the Shadow Diamond in the popular MMPORPG Runescape.

Structures built by layering in this way, such as Stonehenge, are referred to as \\"house of cards architecture\\", which dates back to the Cyclopean and Megalithic ages.Stern, Philip Van Doren,. \\"Prehistoric Europe From Stone Age Man to the Early Greeks\\" N.Y. Norton, 1969, p.250 The origin of the phrase is debated to be from the 18th century England but some believe that it has an American base.  Description  The structures created using this method rely on nothing more than balance and friction in order to stay upright. Ideally, adhesives or other external connecting methods are not used, and no damage or alterations are made to the cards themselves. The larger the structure, the higher the number of balanced cards that could fail and compromise the integrity of the card building. Professional card stacker Bryan Berg claims, however, that the more cards placed on a tower the stronger it becomes because the weight of the cards pushing down on the base (increasing friction) allows occasional cards to stumble without the entire structure collapsing. He also claims that proper stacking technique allows cards to function as shear walls, giving considerable stability to the structure.  World records  The first known record-setting house of cards originally appeared in The Strand Magazine in September 1901. The earliest known record for card stacking was achieved by Victoria Maitland, of the United Kingdom. A photograph of her work was published in The Strand Magazine in September 1901. It was a fifteen-story structure.The Strand Magazine, September 1901, page 357. Following the publication of this record, a second was submitted in April 1902 by Rosie Farner of England with a picture of a twenty-storied tower.The Strand Magazine, April 1902, page 497. A third record was submitted by F. M. Hollams of England, with a tower of twenty-five stories, in February 1903.The Strand Magazine, February 1903, page 235. Other record holders (without bending or altering the cards) include: * Joe Whitlam, of England, with twenty-seven stories, on February 28, 1972Guinness Book of World Records American 14th (Giant 1976) Edition, page 470. \\"highest claim authenticated\\", up to 1976. * James Warnock, of Canada, with sixty-one stories, on September 8, 1978\\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" American 1982 Edition, page 477. * John Slain, of the United States, with sixty-eight stories, on August 3, 1983\\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" American 1987 Edition, page 450. * Bryan Berg, of the United States, with seventy-five stories, on April 21, 1992\\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" American 1994 Edition, page 250.

As a solo artist, Tresvant released the album Ralph Tresvant (1990). In 2008, he began touring with Bobby Brown and Johnny Gill in a new group named Heads of State. Early life Tresvant was born on May 16, 1968, in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Patricia Tresvant and Ralph Hall. Tresvant grew up enjoying music with his younger siblings, sister LaTonya and brother Andre. When some junior high school friends got the idea to put a group together, Tresvant and three others – Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins – started performing at local talent shows. They were spotted by a local up-and-coming producer and songwriter, Brooke Payne, a local manager and choreographer, who encountered the boys at a local talent show in Roxbury. After an audition for Payne, he gave them the name New Edition to signify they were a new edition of the Jackson 5. Maurice Starr, who wanted to create a \\"newer edition\\" of the pop act The Jackson 5, signed them to his independent Streetwise Records label and a fifth member, Ronnie DeVoe (Payne's nephew), was added to the group. Releasing their debut album, Candy Girl, in 1983. The album was a successful launching pad for the group, spawning the teen-oriented hit singles \\"Popcorn Love,\\" \\"Is This the End\\" and the title track. Career After a dispute over money, New Edition left Starr's management and record label and signed with major label MCA Records, which released the group's self-titled second album. Tresvant's smooth, approachable vocal style had become a signature for the group, and the hits continued, including the Top Five smash single \\"Cool It Now.\\" Quiet and shy, Tresvant was initially apprehensive about the idea of recording a solo project. Tresvant felt as if the members of the group were not showing him the acknowledgment that he thought he deserved. However, after witnessing the huge success of Bobby Brown's solo albums and of Ronnie DeVoe, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins' Bell Biv Devoe side project, Tresvant eventually relented. His self-titled debut was released in 1990. The lead single \\"Sensitivity\\" spent 20 weeks on the U.S. R&B; Singles chart, including two weeks at Number One. The album also included the Top 5 hit singles \\"Do What I Gotta Do\\" and \\"Stone Cold Gentleman\\", the latter of which features guest vocals from former band member Bobby Brown. Tresvant's self-titled debut album sold two million copies, achieving double-platinum status. Tresvant's vocals were also featured on songs on the soundtracks for the films Mo' Money (\\"Money Can't Buy You Love\\") and The Preacher's Wife (\\"Somebody Bigger Than You and I\\").

It is part of the standard algorithm to add numbers together by starting with the rightmost digits and working to the left. For example, when 6 and 7 are added to make 13, the \\"3\\" is written to the same column and the \\"1\\" is carried to the left. When used in subtraction the operation is called a borrow. Carrying is emphasized in traditional mathematics, while curricula based on reform mathematics do not emphasize any specific method to find a correct answer. Carrying makes a few appearances in higher mathematics as well. In computing, carrying is an important function of adder circuits.  Manual arithmetic  Example: The addition of two decimal numbers A typical example of carry is in the following pencil-and-paper addition: ¹ 27 \\\\+ 59 \\\\---- 86 7 + 9 = 16, and the digit 1 is the carry. The opposite is a borrow, as in −1 47 − 19 \\\\---- 28 Here, , so try , and the 10 is got by taking (\\"borrowing\\") 1 from the next digit to the left. There are two ways in which this is commonly taught: # The ten is moved from the next digit left, leaving in this example in the tens column. According to this method, the term \\"borrow\\" is a misnomer, since the ten is never paid back. # The ten is copied from the next digit left, and then 'paid back' by adding it to the subtrahend in the column from which it was 'borrowed', giving in this example in the tens column.  Mathematics education  Traditionally, carry is taught in the addition of multi-digit numbers in the 2nd or late first year of elementary school. However, since the late 20th century, many widely adopted curricula developed in the United States such as TERC omitted instruction of the traditional carry method in favor of invented arithmetic methods, and methods using coloring, manipulatives, and charts. Such omissions were criticized by such groups as Mathematically Correct, and some states and districts have since abandoned this experiment, though it remains widely used. Higher mathematics Kummer's theorem states that the number of carries involved in adding two numbers in base p is equal to the exponent of the highest power of p dividing a certain binomial coefficient. When several random numbers of many digits are added, the statistics of the carry digits bears an unexpected connection with Eulerian numbers and the statistics of riffle shuffle permutations. In abstract algebra, the carry operation for two-digit numbers can be formalized using the language of group cohomology. This viewpoint can be applied to alternative characterizations of the real numbers.  Computing  When speaking of a digital circuit like an adder, the word carry is used in a similar sense. In most computers, the carry from the most significant bit of an arithmetic operation (or bit shifted out from a shift operation) is placed in a special carry bit which can be used as a carry-in for multiple precision arithmetic or tested and used to control execution of a computer program. The same carry bit is also generally used to indicate borrows in subtraction, though the bit's meaning is inverted due to the effects of two's complement arithmetic. Normally, a carry bit value of \\"1\\" signifies that an addition overflowed the ALU, and must be accounted for when adding data words of lengths greater than that of the CPU. For subtractive operations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines set the carry flag on borrow while some machines (such as the 6502 and the PIC) instead reset the carry flag on borrow (and vice versa).

Together, they had three sons (Anis, Navaid and Junaid) and a daughter (Fauzia). In 1950, Dani was promoted to the position of Superintendent-in-Charge of Archaeology. In the same year, he became General Secretary of Asiatic Society of Pakistan in Dhaka. Later on, in 1955, he took the position of President, National Committee for Museums in Pakistan. For a period of twelve years (between 1950–62), Dani remained Associate Professor of History at University of Dhaka, while at the same time working as curator at Dhaka museum. During this period, he carried out archaeological research on the Muslim history of Bengal. Dani moved to the University of Peshawar in 1962, where he created the Department of Archaeology and remained as a Professor until 1971. During this time, he led the resetting and renovation works for the Lahore and Peshawar Museums. He became Chairman of Research Society in University of Peshawar in 1970. In 1971, he moved to University of Islamabad to become Dean of Faculty of Social Sciences. He left the post in 1975 to concentrate on research as Professor of History. Meanwhile, the university was renamed Quaid-e-Azam University in 1976. He continued to work in various positions until his retirement in 1980 when he was made Emeritus Professor. During this period, he also served as President of the Archaeological and Historical Association of Pakistan (1979) and Co- Director of the Pak-German Team for Ethnology Research in Northern Areas of Pakistan (1980). He received an Honorary Doctorate from Tajikistan University, (Dushanbe) in 1993. During the same year, Dani established the Islamabad Museum. Between 1992–96, he was appointed Advisor to the Ministry of Culture of Pakistan, on archaeology. Between 1994-98, he remained Chairman of the National Fund for Cultural Heritage in Islamabad. In 1997, Dani became Honorary Director at the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilizations. He held the position until the time of his death. On 22 January 2009, he was admitted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad with heart, kidney and diabetes problems. He died on 26 January 2009 at the age of 88 years.  Visiting, research and honorary positions  During his Associate Professorship at Dhaka University, Dani worked as a Research Fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (1958–59). Later, in 1969 he became Asian Fellow at the Australian National University, Canberra. In 1974, he went to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as a visiting scholar. In 1977, he was Visiting Professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Over the span of his career, Dani was awarded honorary fellowships of Royal Asiatic Society of Bangladesh (1969), German Archaeological Institute (1981), Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsMEO) (1986) and Royal Asiatic Society (1991). In 1991, Dani was made Honorary Citizen of Bukhara and Honorary Member of Paivand Society in Tajikistan. He was made Honorary Life Patron of Al-Shifa Trust, Rawalpindi in 1993.  Research contributions  Indus basin Dani remained engaged in excavation works on the pre-Indus Civilization site of Rehman Dheri in Northern Pakistan.Khan, Omar (1998). An interview with Ahmad Hasan Dani on HARAPPA.COM website in Islamabad, on 6 January 1998, Retrieved 30 April 2020 He also made a number of discoveries of Gandhara sites in Peshawar and Swat Valleys, and worked on Indo-Greek sites in Dir.Iqbal, M.

From his extensive fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic perspective of the socio- political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any significant role in the development of Indus Valley culture.Dani, A.H. (1975). Origins of Bronze Age Cultures in the Indus Basin - a geographic perspective Expedition Pennsylvania Museum website. Retrieved 30 April 2020 Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufism influences. Dani maintained that despite the Arabian Sea allowing the Meluhhans to establish trade relations with Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the majority of historical movements occurred between Central and South Asia. The geographic location as a link between the two regions has characterised the relationship \\"between the people of Pakistan and those of Central Asia in the field of culture, language, literature, food, dress, furniture and folklore\\".Dani, A.H.

One of the most prolific and critically acclaimed hip hop producers of the 2000s, he is widely known for his collaborations with MF DOOM (as Madvillain), J Dilla (as Jaylib), and Freddie Gibbs (as MadGibbs). Madlib has described himself as a \\"DJ first, producer second, and MC last.\\"Aziri (2002).Mugshot magazine, Vol 2, Issue 3, 2003  Early life  Madlib was born in Oxnard, California to musician parents Otis Jackson, Sr. and Dora Sinesca Jackson. He sampled his first song at 11 years old, sourced from his father's collection. His younger brother is the producer and rapper Michael \\"Oh No\\" Jackson.Oh No Talks About His Albums, Having Madlib as an Older Brother, Working with Alchemist & MF Doom – XXL. Xxlmag.com (June 27, 2012). Retrieved on 2014-05-12. His uncle is the jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis. He was raised in Oxnard, where he began his music career.  Music career  1993–1998: Early career = In the early 1990s, Madlib formed a loose-knit collective composed of rappers who worked with him in his Oxnard-based \\"Crate Diggas Palace\\" studio. This collective was composed primarily of his friends, and became known as CDP. Madlib's first commercially released music was production for the rap group Tha Alkaholiks in 1993. He went on to record music of his own with the group Lootpack. Their 12-inch EP Ill Psyche Move was released by Madlib's father in 1995 on a label also called Crate Diggas Palace. This record caught the attention of Peanut Butter Wolf, founder of the Stones Throw Records label, who signed the group in 1998. Madlib at Stones Throw Records special, December 4, 2005 =1999–2009: Stones Throw Records= Lootpack's 1999 debut album Soundpieces: Da Antidote ushered in a string of releases on Stones Throw centering on Madlib's production work which would continue for a decade. His first solo work, The Unseen, under the guise of Quasimoto, came in 2000. The album was met with critical acclaim and named by Spin as one of the top 20 albums of the year. In 2001, Madlib moved away from hip hop music and began a series of releases from Yesterdays New Quintet, a jazz-based, hip hop and electronic- influenced quintet made up of alter-egos or fictional musicians played by Madlib. Over the next several years, through several record releases on Stones Throw and other labels, the growing number of pseudonyms and fictional players came to be known as Yesterdays Universe. Madlib was later invited to remix tracks from the Blue Note Records archive in 2003, which he released as Shades of Blue. In addition to the remixes, the album contained newly recorded interpretations of Blue Note originals, many of which were credited to members of Yesterdays New Quintet. Beginning with the 2007 album The Funky Side of Life by Yesterdays New Quintet spin-off group Sound Directions, the Yesterdays Universe also began incorporating additional session musicians who were not pseudonyms of Madlib. Returning to hip hop music in 2003, Madlib announced two collaborative projects. He joined hip hop producer J Dilla in a duo known as Jaylib, which released Champion Sound. Madlib then collaborated with rapper MF DOOM, known together as Madvillain. Their 2004 album Madvillainy was highly anticipated and well-received, topping many critics' year-end lists. The 2005 Quasimoto album The Further Adventures of Lord Quas met with warm reception and continued the Quasimoto tradition of using vocal samples from Melvin Van Peebles, who is credited on the album liner notes as a collaborator. Throughout the rest of the decade Madlib continued to release jazz material simultaneously with his hip hop work: Perseverance with Percee P, Liberation with Talib Kweli, Sujinho with Ivan Conti of Azymuth, his own instrumental hip hop series Beat Konducta, In Search of Stoney Jackson with Strong Arm Steady, O. J. Simpson with Guilty Simpson, and production work for artists such as Erykah Badu and De La Soul. Madlib and J Rocc in Cologne, Germany, in 2003 =2010–present: Madlib Invazion, Madlib Medicine Show= In 2010, Madlib announced his own imprint called Madlib Invazion, formed to release a music series called Madlib Medicine Show. The series would ultimately take over two years to complete, culminating with 13 album releases and several vinyl-only EPs spanning hip-hop, jazz, remixes, and multi-genre DJ mixtapes. The label has continued to release records outside of the original series. In 2011, Madlib composed the film score for the A Tribe Called Quest documentary film Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest. Madlib also produced \\"Cadillacs\\" with Snoop Dogg for his mixtape That's My Work Volume 3, released on February 27, 2014. Freddie Gibbs and Madlib announced plans for a collaboration album late in 2011 with the release of an EP titled Thuggin, which was followed by a second EP titled Shame on June 22, 2012 and a third EP titled Deeper on September 24, 2013. The duo's full-length collaboration album Piñata was released on March 18, 2014 to widespread critical acclaim. The pair, later known as MadGibbs, released a follow-up album titled Bandana on June 28, 2019. In a 2010 interview with LA Weekly, Madlib stated that Kanye West put five of his beats on hold for the album he was working on at the time. While none of the beats were used, Madlib did take part in the recording sessions for the album, which evolved from Good Ass Job to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He was also rumored to be involved in West's collaboration album with Jay-Z entitled Watch the Throne, but ultimately was not. West was interviewed as part of the 2014 Stones Throw documentary film Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton, in which he opens up about working with Madlib and wanting more of his beats for future projects. On January 18, 2016, West released the Madlib- produced \\"No More Parties in L.A.\\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on SoundCloud as part of his GOOD Fridays series. According to reports, the track originated from the recording sessions for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010. West also recited a few lines from the track in the Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton interview. \\"No More Parties in L.A.\\" appears on his seventh album, which underwent several name changes: So Help Me God, SWISH, and Waves, before finally being released as The Life of Pablo on February 12, 2016. West also hinted at the possibility of future collaborations with Madlib via Twitter thanking him for sending over six beat CDs. Following Mac Miller's death, Chicago producer Thelonious Martin claimed on February 20, 2019, that Mac Miller and Madlib were reportedly working on an album together, called MacLib. Madlib addressed this statement on March 19, 2019, stating that he had recorded an EP with Mac Miller between 2015 and 2017, but that there was no plans of releasing the EP. However, Madlib added during an interview on June 3, 2019, that if Mac Miller's estate gives him the right to, he will release the EP. On February 8, 2020, a MacLib song was leaked. Musical style and influences During an interview on Chrome Children, Madlib stated that his most significant musical influences include Miles Davis, Sun Ra, and David Axelrod. Some of his rap influences are Large Professor, Marley Marl, Paul C, DJ Pooh, and Dr. Dre.

Revenge was built in the summer of 1776 by Colonel Jeduthan Baldwin at Fort Ticonderoga, New York. The schooner, commanded by a Captain Seaman, joined the flotilla commanded by General Benedict Arnold at Crown Point. She got underway at sunset on 24 August and headed north along the New York shore of Lake Champlain. Two days later, when Connecticut lost a mast during a storm, Revenge towed the damaged gundalow out of danger of grounding. In the weeks that followed, the ships maneuvered on the lake enabling the green crews, for the most part made up of landsmen, to learn the ways of the sea. Meanwhile, the British were building a fleet farther north, and were preparing to challenge Arnold for control of the lake. Naval supremacy would enable the King's troops assembled in Canada to drive down the strategic Lake Champlain- Hudson River corridor to New York. Success of this British strategy would cut the American colonies in two, beginning a dismemberment process by which the \\"redcoats\\" could defeat the \\"rebels\\" in detail and restore Royal authority in North America. The two forces met on 11 October in the Battle of Valcour Island, fought in the strait between Valcour Island and the lake's western shore where Arnold had stationed his ships. In the action, the outgunned Americans suffered a tactical defeat, but won a great strategic victory by delaying the British advance for a year - a year in which the Americans strengthened their Army enough to capture General Burgoyne's expeditionary force at Saratoga. After the battle of Valcour Island, Revenge and the other remaining American ships retired farther up the lake. Only Revenge, another schooner, two galleys, and a sloop reached the protection of Fort Ticonderoga. She remained on the upper lake until she was taken early in July 1777 when a British force under General Burgoyne captured Fort Ticonderoga. However, some sources indicate that the schooner may have been burned and sunk to prevent capture. Disposition The August/September 1909 issue of The Vermonter magazine (page 238) includes a photo of the remains of a ship with a caption, \\"The Revenge, one of the battleships of Benedict Arnold's fleet. - This vessel, with two others, escaped to shelter of Fort Ticonderoga, after a running battle with a superior British force in 1776. In January 1909, it was recovered from the lake bottom and is now on exhibition near the lake shore at Fort Ticonderoga.\\" Included is also this short description, excerpted from a tercentenary tour of the lake by dignitaries aboard the steamboat Ticonderoga (now on display at the Shelburne Museum), which says, \\"Ashore in the shadow of Ti's high bluff - we come upon a curious relic - a water-beaten hulk, some fifty feet long, ribs and planking quite intact, set on piers and surrounded by a fence. This is placarded as the schooner Revenge, one of Arnold's fleet escaped to shelter of the Fort in '76, to be burned and sunk by Col. Brown the following year.\\" That reference in The Vermonter presumably refers to the Col. John Brown, whose destruction of ships is mentioned in a plaque honoring him, erected in 1935 by the Massachusetts Society of the Colonial Dames of America and located in Fort Ticonderoga, which reads, \\"Col. John Brown of Pittsfield, Mass. killed October 19th, 1780 at Stone Arabia, N.Y. on his thirty-fifth birthday. Was with Ethan Allen, May 10th, 1775. Made a gallant attempt to retake the fort September 17th to 22nd, 1777 but failed owing to the sturdy defence of Brig. Gen. Henry W. Powell. Colonel Brown destroyed the shipping and outer works, captured 225 British and Germans and released 100 American prisoners.\\" Timbers from the Revenge were used by Ernest F.

Retrieved on July 17, 2016. - June 22, 2000) was a Texas death-row inmate who was sentenced to death at the age of 17 for the murder of 53-year-old Bobby Grant Lambert in Houston, Texas, on May 13, 1981. He was executed by lethal injection on June 22, 2000 in Huntsville, Texas. Lambert's murder occurred at night in the parking lot of a Safeway supermarket. Although Sankofa denied committing the murder, he admitted that at the time of Lambert's death he was on a week-long spree of armed robberies, assaults, attempted murders and one rape. He was captured after a 57-year-old woman he had kidnapped, raped and tortured gained control of his gun and held it on him. She then called police. Sankofa maintained his innocence of Lambert's murder from the time of his arrest and throughout the nineteen years he spent on death row. He pleaded guilty to armed robbery charges. Sankofa's supporters, including Coretta Scott King, bishop Desmond Tutu, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and celebrities Danny Glover, Kenny Rogers, Lionel Richie, Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee, brought his case international attention, arguing that his conviction was based on the claim that the testimony of a single eyewitness who said she saw him for a few seconds in the dark parking lot committing the murder. The witness contradicts this claim, stating she saw his face three times over the course of two to three minutes as she followed him from the crime scene. She was one of 19 witnesses to identify Graham during a crime spree which included 20 armed robberies, 3 kidnappings, 1 rape, and 3 attempted murders in addition to the Lambert murder. The jury did not hear testimony from a few other apparent eyewitnesses who believed that Sankofa was not the killer because they believed he was too short to be the killer. They did not see his face. No other suspects were questioned and there was a lack of physical evidence. Supporters also argued that there was other crucial evidence the jury did not hear and that he had poor legal representation at the time of his trial. At the time of his execution, Sankofa became the 23rd inmate executed in Texas during 2000 and the 222nd person to be executed in Texas since capital punishment was resumed there in 1982.  Childhood  Gary Lee Graham was born to Thelma Griffin and Willie Graham. A high school dropout, Sankofa was illiterate at the time of his arrest. Growing out of control as a teen, his negative behavior began with nonviolent petty offenses, starting on May 14, 1981. On May 20, he was arrested for his first major felony: the series of ten armed robberies and aggravated assaults during his week-long spree of crime, including the rape of 57-year-old taxi driver Lisa Blackburn, which he pleaded guilty to and faced 20-year prison sentences. On May 27, however, witness Bernadine Skillern identified Sankofa as Lambert's murderer, and on November 9, at age 18, Sankofa was on death row for the murder of Lambert.  Prison  The Ellis Unit housed the State of Texas death row for men until mid-1999. Allan B. Polunsky Unit houses the State of Texas death row for men. Huntsville Unit, where Sankofa was put to death Sankofa entered the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) as inmate #696 on November 9, 1981. Sankofa was initially located in the Ellis Unit, but was transferred to the Allan B. Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit) in 1999.\\"Death Row Facts.\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on February 4, 2016. In prison, Sankofa learned to read and write, earning his GED and paralegal certification. From the day of his arrest, he acknowledged portions of his week-long crime spree. For these crimes, he had served almost two decades in prison, apologizing verbally and in writing to the victims of these crimes and asked young people to turn their backs on criminal conduct. Graham's mother was found dead on the street in 1988. However, until their deaths, Graham's parents were fiercely sure of his innocence and spent their last years struggling to free him from death row. He became a political activist and in 1995 changed his name from Gary Lee Graham to Shaka Sankofa. The name \\"Shaka\\" was chosen in honor of the South African warrior Shaka Zulu, and \\"Sankofa\\" means to go back to the past and bring to the present, according to Rev. Herbert Daughtry of New York; the name also \\"represented linking the current struggle against capital punishment with the historical struggle blacks have waged for freedom, justice and equality.\\" He also co-founded a prison organization and newspaper, The Endeavor Project, which were devoted to abolishing the death penalty. By the end of his life, he had also written a soon-to-be-published book, The Evolution of Shaka Sankofa. Sankofa was scheduled to be executed five times: once in 1987, three times in 1993 (April, in which Lambert's widow Loretta appealed to Governor Ann Richards to spare Sankofa's life; May and August), and once on January 11, 1999, and each time he was given a stay of execution before it was lifted.  Execution  Sankofa was put to death following a series of last-minute legal maneuvers, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to halt the execution in a 5-4 vote. Sankofa's attorneys then filed a civil suit in federal court in Austin, Texas, charging the execution was a violation of his civil rights. District Court Judge James Nowlin rejected that claim. There was heavy security outside the Huntsville Unit, known as \\"The Walls\\", with riot police equipped with tear gas and batons. Thousands of protesters showed up outside the prison on the night of Sankofa's execution. Anti-death penalty advocates marched, waved signs and chanted, \\"Let Gary Graham live!\\" Prison authorities took no chances, corralling Sankofa's opponents and supporters on separate ends of the imposing brick prison. At one point, about a hundred Sankofa supporters attempted to confront around twenty Ku Klux Klansmen demonstrating in favor of the execution, but the police kept them apart. Two protesters who tried to break through police barricades were tackled by officers, who handcuffed them and took them away. After the appeals had failed, Sankofa resisted when the time came for him to be taken to the death chamber. A Cell Extraction Team was dispatched to force him towards the death chamber, where it took five jail guards to strap him to the gurney. Witnesses to the execution on the victim's behalf included Bobby Hanners, Lambert's grandson; Diane Clements, a family friend and director of the victims' rights group, Justice for All; and Rick Sanford, one of Graham's victims during his rampage. \\"My heart goes out to the Graham family as they begin the grieving process,\\" Hanners said in a written statement. \\"I also pray Gary Graham made peace with God. But I truly believe justice has been served.\\" Witnesses to the execution on Sankofa's behalf included his stepmother Elnora Graham, his spiritual advisor, Nation of Islam Minister Robert Muhammad, Bianca Jagger, Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Al Sharpton. Sankofa released a final statement in which he again asserted his innocence and denounced the government.  Funeral and memorial service  More than 2000 people attended Sankofa's wake on June 28, 2000 and his funeral the following day. He was buried at Paradise North Cemetery in Houston in a gold-colored casket, wearing a turquoise and gold African garment. Ross Mortuary in Houston's 5th Ward had his body.  Family  Sankofa was survived by his daughter and son, Deidra and Gary Lee Hawkins, ages 19 and 20, respectively, at the time of their father's execution. He was also survived by his granddaughter, stepmother, paternal grandmother, sister, stepsister, and three brothers. His son Gary, who was two years old at the time of his father's arrest, was arrested at the age of 20 for the murder of his friend, 32-year-old Melvin Pope, on March 28, 2000, about three months before his father's execution. On March 27, 2001, he was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. He maintains his innocence.

It was established on 8 August 1941 under the Hyderabad State Bank Act, during the reign of the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan. The bank managed the Osmania Sicca, the currency of Hyderabad state, which covered the present-day Telangana, some districts later known as Hyderabad-Karnataka of Karnataka and Marathwada of Maharashtra. (At the time a number of the princely states had their own currencies.) The bank also carried out commercial banking. The bank opened its first branch at Gunfoundry, Hyderabad on 5 April 1942. The Imperial Bank of India, which had established a branch in Hyderabad in 1868 and another in Secunderabad in 1906, provided officers and clerical staff in the initial stages, and later provided training for new recruits. The first secretary of Hyderabad State Bank was Muhammad Saleh Akbar Hydari, son of Sir Akbar Hydari.

The band originally consisted of two brothers, Mato Nanji (Maiari) ('mah-TOE non-GEE' vocals and guitar, born 1974), Pte ('peh-TAY' bass guitar), along with their sister, Wanbdi ('wan-ba-DEE' drums, vocals), and their cousin, Horse (percussion). Their music is influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana. Mato Nanji's style and skill has drawn comparisons to each of these guitarists. The band has also shared the stage with artists of varying musical genres such as B.B. King, Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, the Indigo Girls, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews Band, and Los Lonely Boys. The band has headlined its own tours several times. The Nakota Nation members grew up on South Dakota's Yankton Indian Reservation, where their father, Greg Zephier became a spokesperson for Native American rights. A musician in his own right during the 1960s and 1970s, Zephier provided his children with records from blues musicians such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Freddie King, and taught them to play their respective instruments. The family started touring together, and soon the children were performing on their own. Musical career The group released their debut album, Things We Do on Pachyderm Records in 1998. In 1999, Indigenous won three Native American Music Awards for their debut record, including two top honors: Album of the Year and Group of the Year. The track \\"Now That You're Gone\\" peaked at #22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. Amazon.com named the band Blues Artist of the Year, and soon after they were featured on broadcast shows such as NPR's \\"All Things Considered\\", \\"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\\" \\"CBS Saturday Morning,\\" and \\"Austin City Limits\\". B.B. King became a self- proclaimed fan, and invited the band to join his Blues Festival Tour. Later that year, Indigenous released an EP, Blues This Morning, and a full-length album, Live at Pachyderm Studios in 1999, and continued the momentum. Live at Pachyderm won two Native American Music Awards for Best Blues Album and Group of the Year in 2000. Their next LP, Circle, settled into place in Billboard 's Top Blues Albums Chart after its release in 2000. Following this was the 2003 self-titled album, Indigenous (Zomba), and then another EP, Long Way Home in 2005 (on their own record label). This seven-song EP contains five originals, as well as an acoustic version of a song from Things We Do, \\"Rest Of My Days\\", and a live version of their first single, \\"Things We Do\\". After recording their 2006 album, Chasing the Sun (Vanguard) the band split. Mato carried on with the Indigenous name and toured with a new line-up that included bassist Chaney Bryant and drummer Ray Mehlbaum in support of the album. In 2008, Mato wrote and recorded the album Broken Lands which was released on August 12, 2008. More recently, the band released The Acoustic Sessions on June 8, 2010. Time is Coming (2014) was described in reviews as \\"closer to rock than blues.\\" This follows the last CD entitled Vanishing Americans (2012) that paid homage to Mato father, Greg Zephier, Sr. It is dedicated to indigenous youth and all young people on indigenous reservations. His 10th commercial album, Vanishing Americans, released on Blues Bureau International, a division of the Shrapnel Record Group, won the Native American Music Award's \\"Album of the Year\\" award in 2014. The CD honored Greg, who was a spiritual advisor and spokesperson for the International Indian Treaty Council.

As of 2014, the theater is owned by Carole Shorenstein Hays.  History  Playbill featuring Will Rogers in Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! from 1934 Homer Curran operated another theater with his name for several years prior to building this Curran Theatre; however, the original Curran Theatre had various names before and after this time, whereas this Curran Theatre has never had another name. It opened in February 1922 and was initially a Shubert house. Later, it was a showcase for Theatre Guild presentations. Subsequently, it became closely associated with the Civic Light Opera (CLO), which also operated in Los Angeles. The CLO obtained numerous prestigious bookings as well as produced their own shows, often with stars as the lead roles. Curran wrote the book for the musical Song of Norway and co-wrote the book for Magdalena. He eventually left San Francisco for southern California, where he rented theatrical lighting. For many years, the San Francisco Opera performed its annual \\"Spring Opera\\" series at the Curran. In 1977, the Civic Light Opera shifted its operations to the Orpheum Theatre, and by the end of that year, Carole Shorenstein Hays and James M. Nederlander assumed operation of the Curran and launched their Best of Broadway season starting with John Raitt in the national tour of Shenandoah and including the West Coast debut of Annie. Later, Shorenstein changed the name of her organization to SHN. In 2015 Shorenstein left SHN, focusing her attention solely on the Curran. SHN no longer operates the Curran. The theatre closed in September 2015 for renovations. Work included new upholstery for seats, carpeting, mechanical and electrical systems as well as expanded and upgraded lobbies. While work was underway, the theatre presented non-traditional works in a series called Under Construction in which the audience entered and was seated on the stage. The Curran reopened January 25, 2017 with the musical Fun Home. Architecture and interior The ceiling above the main lobby was hand-painted to look like wood (steel wool was used to fashion a wood grain effect in the plaster before painting). The main lobby has a marble floor but has long since been covered by carpeting. There are \\"plugs\\" built into the lobby floor in which to insert stanchions from which theater ropes were hung to section off the lobby. The loge section was modified prior to Hello, Dolly!'s first booking at the theater. Originally, the loge section was similar to the boxes, with movable chairs in sectioned areas. The box-like loges are still evident by what remains of the metal railings in front of the loge section as well as the decorative plaster when viewed from below. The change was made because it increased the seating capacity by about ten seats in this highly desirable area. The interior main floor lobby no longer exists. Originally, it was changed to a minor degree to accommodate the installation of a sound booth without decreasing the orchestra seating capacity. Eventually, the lobby space was used to install a larger bar area as well as accessible restrooms. The theater has two front curtains: the decorative green fire curtain in front of a gold curtain. When musicals traditionally utilized each theater's front curtains, the first curtain would be raised five minutes prior to the start of the show. There were two coat check rooms: one off to the south of the main floor interior lobby and the other on the balcony (adjacent to the ladies' restroom). There were also two telephone \\"booths\\" on the mezzanine lobby—one on each side of the windows. These booths were actually very small rooms with formal doors. The coat check rooms and telephone booths are now used for storage. The theater also had a central vacuum system. This system is still evident by the connection points on the walls, near the floor. The chandelier was built in San Francisco by Phoenix Day. A plaque honoring Arthur Mayer is mounted at the entrance to boxes L-M-N. Mayer watched the theater being built, was hired by Curran as part of the theater's opening-night staff, and continued working at the theater until he was nearly 100 years old.  Productions  The Curran has hosted more pre-Broadway engagements than any other theater in San Francisco. Productions that have been staged at the Curran prior to moving to Broadway have included A Chorus Line revival (2006), Beautiful: The Carole King Musical (2013), Biloxi Blues (1985), Brighton Beach Memoirs (1983), Carnival in Flanders (1953), Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance (2004), Fences (1987), Gigi (1973), Head Over Heels (2018), Home Sweet Homer (Odyssey) (1975),.

Other significant long runs presented by SHN at the Curran include Les Misérables, Jersey Boys, They're Playing Our Song, as well as Lily Tomlin in Jane Wagner's The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.

Career William Hodge, an agent of the American commissioners to France, Benjamin Franklin, and Silas Deane purchased Revenge at Dunkirk, France, for Continental service in the spring or summer of 1777. The British Ambassador to Paris complained that the ship had been fitted in a French (and supposedly neutral) port; but Hodge circumvented the diplomatic objection by a feigned sale of the cutter to an English subject, Richard Allen. Revenge departed Dunkirk, on 17 July 1777, ostensibly for Bergen, Norway; but, as soon as she was at sea, Captain Gustavus Conyngham, the \\"Dunkirk Pirate\\" who had recently preyed upon British shipping in , took command; hoisted Continental colors; and headed for the North Sea. Four days later Revenge captured the large schooner Happy Return; and, on the 23rd, made a prize of the brig Maria. Since British warships were nearby and threatening during both captures, Conyngham burned the prizes. The brig Patty was brought to on the 25th and ransomed. These Continental successes, so close to the shores of England, sent London insurance rates skyrocketing and inhibited British trade. On the 26th, Revenge stopped Northampton; but that brig was recaptured before she could reach port for condemnation proceedings. Revenge at Kinehead, Ireland for supplies For two months Revenge remained at sea cruising off north-western Europe and the British Isles before she put in at Kinehead on the northwestern coast of Ireland to repair her bowsprit and to replenish her casks of fresh water. Conyngham, who had been sending his prizes to ports in Spain, now himself headed for the Bay of Biscay, putting in at Ferrol. In the coming months, Revenge made several cruises from Spanish ports and captured many prizes. On one of the cruises, Conyngham transited the Straits of Gibraltar and operated in the Mediterranean Sea; and, on another, he sailed to the Azores and the Canary Islands. But, word of the cutter's great success reached British ears and the Admiralty ordered English warships to find and destroy her. Moreover, as Revenges fame spread, British diplomatic pressure was brought to bear on the Spanish court to bar her from Spanish ports. Conyngham quietly refitted the ship in a small Spanish port and sailed for the West Indies on 1 September 1778. Before reaching Martinique, Revenge had captured 60 British vessels, destroying 33 and sending 27 to port as prizes. A cruise in the Caribbean added several other ships, including two British privateers, to her score before Revenge arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 21 February 1779, laden with arms and munitions for the Continental Army in South Carolina. The cutter was sold at public auction by an act of Congress of 12 March 1779. Soon after the sale to a firm of Philadelphia merchants for service as a privateer, Revenge operated briefly under charter protecting shipping on the Delaware River. Fate Revenge sailed from the Delaware Capes in April, in a quest for prizes. Conyngham was again Revenges commander and, now, her part-owner. However, her luck had changed. captured Revenge on 27 April 1779 as Revenge chased two privateers off the New York coast.

Based on the fourth generation (ED, EE, EF) Honda Civic it was introduced in Japan on 15 June 1988,http://www.honda.co.jp/factbook/auto/CONCERTO/19880615/index.html Honda Concerto (Japanese), while the British-built European-market version was introduced in October 1989. The production lasted until October 1992 in Japan and 1994 in England. Named for the musical composition, and primarily designed for European tastes, the Concerto was the successor to the second generation Honda Ballade (which was a higher specification third generation Civic sedan), and the Honda Integra which was discontinued for the European Market owing to its unpopularity. All Japanese versions were exclusive to Japanese Honda dealerships called Honda Clio. Model codes for the Japanese-built Concerto are MA1 (1.5-liter), MA2 (1.6-liter), and MA3 (1.6-liter 4WD), whereas the British-built Concerto's model code is HW. The Concerto was sold in both liftback and sedan and built in two locations, Austin Rover's Longbridge plant for the European market, and by Honda in Suzuka, Mie, Japan. One difference between the British-built and Japanese-built Concertos was in the front suspension – versions built in Longbridge had MacPherson struts, unlike their Japanese counterparts which had double wishbones. Although Japanese production began in June 1988, European deliveries only really began after British Concerto production commenced at the end of 1989. The Europe-only models, such as the 1.4, were presented in October 1989. In some European countries (e.g. Germany and Switzerland) and Australia, it was sold as the five-door liftback version only. It acted as replacement for the disappointing Honda Integra five-door liftback in some markets. The sedan version lasted until 1993 for most nations, especially in the United Kingdom where sales were lower compared to the Rover 200 and Rover 400 Series, which was considered the more upmarket of the two vehicles. Engine choices were: *1.4 L (SOHC twin carb) with at 6300 rpm (Europe) *1.5 L (SOHC 2-barrel carb) with at 6000 rpm (Japan) *1.5 L (SOHC DPI) with at 6000 rpm (Europe) *1.6 L (SOHC twin carb) with at 6300 rpm (105 PS in Japan) *1.6 L (SOHC MPI) with at 6300 rpm (120 PS in Japan, Australia) *1.6 L (DOHC MPI) with at 6800 rpm (130 PS in Japan; European models without catalyst: 130 PS DIN with manual transmission and 124 PS DIN with automatic transmission) *1.8 TD turbodiesel (Peugeot-supplied), sold in France, Italy and Portugal only as a badge-engineered Rover 200 diesel Four-wheel drive was an option for the four-door sedan in Japan, a system later shared with the Civic-based compact SUV, the Honda CR-V. The Japanese range received a facelift in February 1991, when the twin-cam ZC engine was also added to the JZ-Si model. The Concerto was sold internationally on a platform which was shared with the popular Civic. Just like the five-door Integra it replaced, it offered more features than the Civic and was aimed at a more prestigious section of the market. The styling of the Concerto reflected an influence from the Honda Ascot, most notably the six-light window treatment of the greenhouse. Honda stopped manufacturing the Concerto in Great Britain when its partner, Rover, was taken over by BMW in 1994. Until that point the two companies had been merged up to 20% equally with each other and had collaborated with this model and many others in both companies ranges. The Concerto sedan was replaced by the Honda Domani in Japan and by the sedan version of the sixth generation (EK, EJ) Honda Civic in other markets. The hatchback version was replaced in Europe by the Domani-based 5 door Civic hatchback which was quite different from the rest of the sixth generation Civic range instead, as with the Domani, being based on the platform that underpinned the fifth generation (EG, EH) Civics. The Concerto hatchback was not replaced in other markets. The Domani/5 door Civic hatchback formed the basis for the 1995 Rover 400 while the 1995 Rover 200 was based on the fourth generation Honda Civic platform, and therefore the Concerto's too.

It has a corporate entity and exists into perpetuity. Its membership is restrictive, mutually exclusive, and often requires a lifetime commitment. Prison officials and others in law enforcement use the euphemism \\"security threat group\\" (or \\"STG\\"). The purpose of this name is to remove any recognition or publicity that the term \\"gang\\" would connote when referring to people who have an interest in undermining the system.  Origins  Convict code and informal governance of prisons = Before the rise of large, formal prison gangs, political scientists and researchers found that inmates had already organized around an understood \\"code\\" or set of norms. For example, political scientist Gresham Sykes in The Society of Captives, a study based on the New Jersey State Prison, claims that \\"conformity to, or deviation from, the inmate code is the major basis for classifying and describing the social relations of prisoners\\".Gresham M. Sykes, The Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1958), 79. Prisoners achieved a social equilibrium around unwritten rules. The code may include an understanding of prison yard and dining hall territory based on rank, race, ethnicity, religion, or crimes committed, or it could simply be loyalty between inmates and against guards. Sykes writes that an inmate may \\"bind himself to his fellow captives with ties of mutual aid, loyalty, affection, and respect, firmly standing in opposition to the officials.\\" Hostility between wardens and prisoners, restrained freedom, and, some argue, the lack of access to heterosexual relationships shaped prison culture's social, environmental and political dynamics. = Rising prison populations and the emergence of formal gangs = When researchers or political scientists actively discuss \\"classic prison gangs\\", they are referring to prison gangs in the United States of America; such gangs began to form in the mid 1960s. Around this time, across the United States prison system, the prison population increased markedly. Compare: As prison populations grew, the informal convict code no longer sufficed to coordinate and protect inmates. The constant surge of prisoners coming into the system with no understanding of the status quo had disrupted the established equilibrium cohesion. And as demographics inside prisons changed drastically, small groups centered on ethnicity, race, and pre-prison alliances were disrupted. John Irwin states in his book, Prisons in Turmoil, that by 1970 \\"there [was] no longer a single, overarching convict culture\\".Irwin, John. 1980. Prisons in Turmoil. Boston: Little, Brown Furthermore, as the prison population grew so did the consumer base for contraband items, not only drugs and weapons but also items that are legal outside of prison but are illegal to trade within prisons, such as money, alcohol, tattoos, etc. Several challenges arose that destabilized the socio-political system of self-enforced cooperation that had existed under the convict code. These new conditions posed complications to consumer-supplier relationships in the already distrustful environment of an underground economy. It became more and more difficult for independent individual suppliers to accommodate this increased demand. Under tight prison security and with limited means, these individual suppliers could only provide a limited amount of product. Their consumer base was too small for them to establish a \\"brand\\" or credibility themselves. New consumers would have to buy products of unknown quality and bear the risk of the supplier being an undercover informant and even the possibility that he would not deliver at all. The ever-fluctuating inmate population also provided a dangerous market in which to operate. Individual suppliers had to protect themselves from possible murder and assault by consumers and other suppliers, as well as to ensure that their products would not be confiscated or stolen. They were vulnerable to those who delivered and carried the contraband into the prison, and they bore the risk of consumers not paying for the product, or (if operating on credit) not paying the loan. The consumers could also be informants. In legal markets, governments mitigate such risks by means of contract enforcement and the upholding of property rights. Gangs may step into this role and fill the power vacuum.Compare: Skaperdas, Stergios. \\"The Political Economy of Organized Crime: Providing Protection When the State Does Not.\\" Conflict and Governance (2003): 163-92. http://www.queensu.ca/dms/DMS_Course_Materials_and_Outline/Readings- MPA831/PolEconOfOrgCrime-831.pdf \\"Mafias and gangs are hierarchically organized and can be thought of as providing primitive state functions, with economic costs that are typically much higher than those associated with modern governance.\\" They vet and manage tax-paying supplier gangs within prisons, regulate transactions, and control violence in the marketplace and on the streets. Prison gangs are effective in governing markets. They provide protection to their member suppliers more effectively than individual suppliers could do for themselves. They carry the credible threat of exercising violence - and even murder in case of theft or snitching - to ensure timely payments. They protect their members against competing suppliers. The size of prison gangs and their scale of product supply also means that they have a broad scope of knowledge about their client base. They share information on informants or inmates who default on payments. This scope of supply also gains a reputation with consumers, who can then feel safe in being able to gauge the quality of product and credibility of suppliers. A crucial difference between individual suppliers who operate under the convict code and prison gangs involves the time-frame in which they operate. Unlike individual suppliers who cycle in and out, prison gangs form long-term institutions, regardless of how often individual members enter or leave the system. There are always plenty of members to maintain the gang's functions – behind bars and on the streets. This means they have a solid incentive to provide a quality product to uphold a good reputation in the long run. Prison gangs have evolved into complex organizations with hierarchies and vote-based ranks and intricate coalitions with exclusive and often permanent memberships. = Alternative factors and explanations = Another approach to understanding prison gang development is based on observations of inmates in the Texas prison system. It provides a five-stage progression from an inmate's entrance to the prison to the formation of a prison gang.Buentello, Salvador, Robert S. Fong, and Ronald E. Vogel. 1991. \\"Prison Gang Development: A Theoretical Model.\\" The Prison Journal 71(2): 3–14. First an inmate enters the prison, alone and thus fearful until he finds a sense of belonging in a \\"clique of inmates.\\" They band together without formal rules, leaders, or membership requirements. It then evolves into a \\"predatory group,\\" creating exclusive requirements for membership and positioning itself against wardens, even assaulting them. Then, by engaging in illegal activities, they choose leaders to manage them. In its final stage, the group emerges as a prison gang. A gendered approach to prison gangs offers two arguments focusing on the idea of male domination and the inmate's adherence to a hyper-masculine ideal. One argument claims that prison order is shaped by the inmates' desire or need for male domination, and the gang reconstructs this sense of power in prison.Dolovich, Sharon. 2011. \\"Strategic Segregation in the Modern Prison\\" American Criminal Law Review 48(1): 1–110. As inmates can no longer \\"subjugate women,\\" they find other forms of domination, resorting to force and violence to control each other. Another approach, discussed by Erving Goffman, maps out four steps of inmate adaptation. In the first step, the inmate undergoes a \\"situational withdrawal\\" or mental withdrawal from the institution. \\"The inmate withdraws apparent attention from everything except events immediately around his body.\\" The second step is called \\"colonization\\" when the inmate tries to rationalize the institution as preferable to life on the outside. The third step, \\"conversion,\\" is when \\"the inmate takes over the staff's view of himself and tries to act out the role of the perfect inmate.\\" The fourth step, which prison gang members fit into, is called \\"the intransigent line,\\" when the inmate refuses the authority of the institution and acts against it.Goffman, Erving, Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates (London: Penguin, 1973) (first published in 1961). There are also two prominent sociological theories surrounding prison gangs and the order within prisons: deprivation theory and importation theory. Deprivation theory argues that social order within prisons arises due to the pain of imprisonment; studies focusing on this theory examine the experiences of prisoners and the nature of their confinement. Importation theory focuses instead on experiences prisoners had prior to incarceration. It explores the ways in which class, race, and drug culture outside the prison have shaped dynamics inside the prison.  Operations and activities  The system of governance in prison gangs highlights the unusual mechanisms by which people (or groups of people) with no access to government institutions manage to facilitate exchange and establish property rights within their scope of influence. The emergence of informal governance systems within prison gangs runs parallel to successful systems of trade and control beyond bars. Skarbek (2011)Skarbek, David. 2011. \\"Governance and prison gangs.\\" American Political Science Review 105(4): 702-716. uses the example of the illegal narcotics trade in Los Angeles to explain how an alternative system of governance behind bars can lead to successful socioeconomic organization. Focusing on the Mexican Mafia prison gang, Skarbek argues that the mafia holds substantial control within local jail systems which allows it to yield power over drug dealers on the streets. Drug dealers outside the prison walls anticipate future incarceration and thus future interaction with the mafia. Faced with the threat of these future run-ins with the Mafia, drug dealers on the street comply with the current demands of prison gangs in order to secure their own future. Since prison gangs gain a long-term profit if transactions in the illicit market run smoothly, they have the incentive to ensure that there is order and cohesion between suppliers and consumers. Similar to stationary bandits that form governance out of anarchy in the model presented by economist Marcur Olson,Mancur Olson, 2000. Power and Prosperity: Outgrowing Communist and Capitalist Dictatorships, Oxford University Press. Description and chapter-preview links. Foreign Affairs review prison gangs are actors who have the ability to extract resources from their population by providing services. They act to maximize their profit, not only by restraining the amount they extort, but by providing services that facilitate exchange and imposing \\"gang taxes\\". The Mexican Mafia, for example, increases its tax revenue by providing three types of services: protect street gang members while they are incarcerated, protect taxpaying drug dealers on the street, and settling of disputes. In the process of maximizing profit, gangs may provide public goods to ensure smooth production, such as working to resolve gang disputes inside and outside of the prison. Moreover, by holding the monopoly on violence in prisons, they pose a credible threat to street gangs, which they leverage to extort their profits. So prison gangs can extort street gangs because they pose a credible threat to inmates in the county jail, and street gang members rationally anticipate spending time there. They effectively use incarcerated street gang members as hostages to force non-incarcerated gang members to pay. Furthermore, they can encourage street gangs to steal from and make war with other non-taxpaying street gangs. However, prison gangs cannot extort drug dealers whom they cannot harm in jail; for American prison gangs, this usually means members of other races (the county jails segregate them based upon race). They also cannot extort taxes from people who do not anticipate incarceration because there is no threat of facing violence in prison. And they cannot tax those outside the jurisdiction of a jail controlled by the gang. Non-incarcerated prison gang members collect taxes and regulate fraud and imposters acting as tax collectors. Taxpayers also ensure that their money is going to the right hands because consequences otherwise would be severe. Political scientist David Skarbeck writes, \\"Like the stationary bandit, prison gangs provide governance institutions that allow illicit markets to flourish. They adjudicate disputes and protect property rights. They orchestrate violence so that it is relatively less disruptive. They do not do this because they are benevolent dictators but because they profit from doing so. In addition to governing prisons, gangs are also an important source of governance to the criminal world outside of prison. They wield tremendous power over street gangs, specifically those participating in the drug trade. Because of this power, governance from behind bars helps illicit markets to flourish on the streets.\\" The way that prison gangs consolidate and maintain power is also comparable to how actors behave in Charles Tilly's predatory theory of state-building model.Tilly, Charles (1990). Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1990. Cambridge, Mass., USA: B. Blackwell.. Prison gangs engage in \\"war making,\\" or monopolizing on force and occupying the power vacuum of state authority. They eliminate rivals (in the US mostly along racial lines) within their territories, and in doing so they carry out \\"state making.\\" Gangs offer protection to their members, affiliates, and clients. They also extract or collect taxes from client gangs and those in the trade to maintain and expand their system. One of the cities in South Africa – Cape Town – has its own history of gang activity dating back to the 19th century. One of the authors that wrote about African gangs recorded in one of his books.D. Pinnock, The botherhoods: street gangs and state control in Cape Town, Cape Town: David Phillip, 1984 Gang activity escalated with the establishment in an area known as the Cape Flats. Many young men, turned to gangs for protection, opportunity and a sense of belonging.  Organization and structure  Prison gangs work to recruit members with street smarts and loyalty, and they look for inmates who will be able to carry out the gangs' functions and exercise force when necessary. They also create a structure to monitor activities of members and regulate the behavior of existing members within the gangs to ensure internal cohesion. To ensure that high quality, dedicated members are being recruited, many prison gangs rely on existing members to vouch for or refer new members into the group. To enter gangs, members often have to prove their loyalty through costly activity, often violent hazing or committing some crime such as theft. Gang members mark themselves as part of the gang with tattoos (or colors, on the streets) so that taxpayers know they are credible collectors and so that gangs can keep track of their members as they move in and out of prison. Prison gangs maintain a hierarchy and have written and unwritten rules of conduct. They have constitutions to define expectations and to guide laws for those they govern as well as to direct the process for the creation of new rules. In terms of the hierarchy, at the top of most US prison gangs is a group of \\"shot callers\\" who are like major stakeholders that make the major decisions about operations. Having a single dictator-like shot caller is unusual. Checks and balances within prison gang organizations are lucrative; internally, there ways to voice dissatisfaction towards any level of the organization. For example, when conflicts arise or abuses occur where a higher-ranked gang member commits an offense against a lower-ranked member, an internal court-like body receives complaints and determines punishments. Actions are punished with violence. In many gangs exit is not an option (or is a very costly one); many prison gangs require a lifetime membership. Political scientist Ben Lessing differentiates between prison gangs that arise within the prison system, which he calls 'natives,' and those that were already formed outside, calling them 'imports'.Lessing, Benjamin. The Danger of Dungeons: Prison Gangs and Incarcerated Militant Groups. Small Arms Survey, Chapter 6 (http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/overtime.html) 2010 He claims that norms and culture-like initiation rituals, rules about sex, and relations with guards and non-members are shaped by the direction of formation. Natives have a 'prison character' in their imagery, traits, and codes that they retain even when native gangs engage in operations beyond the prison system. On the other hand, import gangs arrive with a \\"strong group identity, behavioral norms, and often their publicly known histories and reputations.\\" This gives these groups a stronger sense of solidarity and cohesion in prison, though they compensate in how well they navigate the system within prison.Jacobs, James B. 1974. 'Street Gangs behind Bars.' Social Problems, Vol. 21, No. 3, pp. 395–409. —. 1978. Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society. Chicago: University of Chicago Press Imports have an advantage in their existing outside operations. Discussing the organizational mechanism within prisoner gangs, Skarbek (2011) argues that both explicit and implicit rules govern behaviors within these groups. Explicit rules are those that are formally written and structured while implicit rules are those that are based on the values and norms of each group. Though the use of implicit and explicit rules (to what degree and to address which situations) may vary from group to group, Skarbek maintains that since codifying all rules is costly, prison gangs rely in great part, on the existence of implicit rules with values and norms forming a foundation from where informal governance begins. Other social scientists such as Ellickson (1991),Ellickson, Robert C. 1991. \\"Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes.\\" Harvard University Press echo similar claims but with key distinctions. Ellickson states that close-knit groups rely heavily on specific norms and informal rules to achieve cooperation and to minimize transaction costs within governance institutions based on property rights. However, while Ellickson's work focuses on non-hierarchical examples, Skarbek's example considers a hierarchical system of prison gangs. Nevertheless, Skarbek maintains that norms that govern small communities can also govern illegal markets such as those operated by prison gangs.  List of American prison gangs  Hispanic prison gangs = La Eme or the Mexican Mafia: (Blue) \\"Eme\\" is the Spanish name of the letter \\"M,\\" and it is the 13th letter in the alphabet. The Mexican Mafia is composed mostly of Hispanics, although there rarely are some White members (at least associates). The Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are allies. They work together to control prostitution, drug-running, weapons, and \\"hits\\" or murders. Eme was originally formed in the 1956 in the Deuel Vocational Institute. by Hispanic prisoners from the southern part of that state. It has traditionally been composed of US-born and US-raised Hispanics and has retained ties to the Southern California-based \\"Sureños.\\" During the 1970s and 1980s, Eme in California established the model of leveraging its power in prison to control and profit from criminal activity on the street. The gangs activities fall into two categories: conventional crimes - distributing drugs, robbery, and murder, and illicit market exchange - protecting property, enforcing agreements, and handling disputes. Members of the Mexican Mafia are recognized by a \\"black hand\\" tattoo commonly found across their back, chest, leg, or neck. (photo) https://medium.com/vantage/gladiator-school-stories-from-inside- yts-98eaf9db971a Nuestra Familia: (Red) (\\"Our family\\" in Spanish) \\"N,\\" the 14th letter in the alphabet, along with the Roman numeral \\"XIV\\" is the symbol Nuestra Familia is another mostly Hispanic prison gang that is constantly at war with La Eme. It was originally formed by Northern-California- or rural- based Hispanic prisoners with ties to \\"Norteños\\" of Northern California, opposing domination by La Eme which was started by and associated with Los Angeles gang members. Nuestra Familia was first established California's Soledad Prison in the 1960s. The Texas Syndicate: A mostly Texas-based prison gang that includes mostly Hispanic members and does (albeit rarely) allow Caucasian members. The Texas Syndicate, more than La Eme or Nuestra Familia, has been associated or allied with Mexican immigrant prisoners, while Eme and Familia tend to be composed of, and associate with, US-born or US-raised Hispanics. Ñetas: A Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican) gang in Puerto Rico and on the eastern coast of the US. Originally formed in 1970 in Rio Pedras Prison, Puerto Rico. = Black prison gangs = Most African-American prison gangs retain their street gang names and associations. These commonly include Rollin' sets (named after streets, i.e., Rollin' 30s, Rollin' 40s, etc.) that can identify with either Blood or Crip affiliations. The Black Guerilla Family represents an exception. It was originally a politically based group with a significant presence in prisons and prison politics. It was founded in 1966 at San Quentin State Prison in California by former Black Panther member George L. Jackson. United Blood Nation: An African-American prison gang on the east coast. They are rivals with the Netas and have ties with the Black Guerilla Family. Folk Nation: Found in Midwestern and Southern states, allied with Crips, bitter rivals with the People Nation. People Nation: Found in Midwestern and Southern states, allied with Bloods, bitter rivals with the Folk Nation. D.C. Blacks: Founded in Washington D.C. by African-American inmates, are allied with the Black Guerilla Family and United Blood Nation, and enemies to the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican Mafia. Conservative Vice Lords (CVL): A primarily African-American gang that originated in the St. Charles, Illinois Youth Center outside Chicago. In Chicago, CVL operated primarily in the Lawndale section and used profits from drug sales to continue its operations and used prisons to train and recruit new members. KUMI 415 is a predominantly African-American prison gang that was originally formed in Folsom State Prison in the mid-1980s, and the founding members were mainly from the San Francisco Bay Area. = White prison gangs = Aryan Brotherhood: A white prison gang that originated in California's San Quentin Prison amongst white American prisoners in 1964. Its emblem, \\"the brand,\\" consists of a shamrock and the number 666. Other identifiers include the initials \\"AB,\\" swastikas and the sigrune. Perhaps out of its ideology and the necessity to establish a presence among the more numerous Black and Hispanic gang members, the AB has a particular reputation for ruthlessness and violence. Since the 1990s, in part because of this reputation, the AB has been heavily targeted by state and federal authorities. Many key AB members have been moved to \\"supermax\\" control-unit prisons at both the federal and state level or they are under federal indictment. Nazi Lowriders: A newer white prison gang that emerged after many Aryan Brotherhood members were sent to the Security Housing Unit at Pelican Bay or transferred to federal prisons. NLR is associated with members who are originally from the Antelope Valley and it is also known to accept some light-skinned or Caucasian-identified Hispanic members. Dirty White Boys: A white prison gang made up of inmates from Texas, and has a heavy presence in the federal prison system. European Kindred: A white supremacist prison gang founded in Oregon that is affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood and the Ku Klux Klan. Confederate Knights of America: A white supremacist prison gang in Texas that is affiliated with the KKK and the AB. Aryan Circle: A white supremacist prison gang that is concerned about race before money. Dead Man Incorporated (DMI): A predominantly white prison gang founded in the Maryland Correctional System, with branches in many other correctional facilities throughout the U.S. Aryan Brotherhood of Texas: Despite the similarity of its name, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (A.B.T.) does not have ties with the original Aryan Brotherhood. Founded in Texas in the 1980s the A.B.T. was mainly created as a criminal enterprise. Brotherhood of Aryan Alliance (a. k. a. the \\"211's\\") Soldiers of Aryan Culture Universal Aryan Brotherhood  South Africa  Prominent prison gangs in South Africa: 26s, 27s and 28s, collectively known as the Numbers, originate from a gang called The Ninevites, in the 19th- and early 20th-century. It was born in Johannesburg, and the leader of the Ninevites, \\"Nongoloza\\" Mathebula, is said to have created laws for the gang. \\"Nongoloza\\" became a supernatural figure and left behind an origin myth that shapes the current laws of the Numbers.Steinberg, Jonny. \\"Nongoloza's Children: Western Cape Prison Gangs during and after Apartheid.\\" Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation. Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, July 2014. Web. The gangs began to project outside the prison system starting in 1990, as globalization led to South Africa's illicit markets seeing the rise of large drug trafficking gangs. The Americans and the Firm, the two largest super gangs outside of prison made alliances with Numbers gangs. They imported imagery, laws, and parts of the Numbers's initiation system. Membership in these gangs is not determined by race as it is with US prison gangs, however, initiation is still a costly and violent process, sometimes involving sexual hazing. The 26s, 27s, 28s by means of robbery, murder, extortion, brigandage, of their own culture, their own religious beliefs create a tradition handed down from generation to generation, which continues to exist to this day. They are the historically illegal group of individuals who united in gangs with numeric values mentioned above. They are formed a tradition located in South Africa and called South African criminal tradition originated in Southern Africa 200 years ago according to the official history, and it differs from other traditions with the case that it came first in the wild and then in prison, because most of other criminal traditions originated inside the prison. = Differences with other gangs = * They have a special cult of Counter God which is called the Ninevites * Special rules divided from the legend of Nongoloza Mathebula that set the rules of life of 26s, 27s and 28s * They have a special cult of knife which they use as a form of punishment and execution. There are two kind of knives: the long and the short one. The short one is used for punishes and the long one is used for executions. * They have a special combat system with a knife. * They have a special language – sabela. * They use a forced education of their adherents. * There is a hopelessness of the situation that creates a special religion.Lewis, Heather Parker: God's gangsters: The numbers, gangs and South African tattoo prison culture (Ihilihili press, Cape Town, 2006). -  Brazil  The Primeiro Comando da Capital (or the PCC) is a Brazilian prison gang based in São Paulo. The gang rose in 1993 at a soccer game at Taubate Penitentiary to fight for prisoners' rights in the aftermath of the 1992 Carandiru Massacre, when São Paulo state military police killed more than 100 inmates.Hanson, Stephanie. \\"Brazil's Powerful Prison Gang.\\" Council on Foreign Relations.

Web. 08 May 2016 The gang orchestrated rebellions in 29 São Paulo state prisons simultaneously in 2001, and since then it has caught the attention of the public for ensuing waves of violence. The Brazilian police and media estimate that at least 6,000 members pay monthly dues and are thus a base part of the organization. According to São Paulo Department of Investigation of Organized Crime, more than 140,000 prisoners are under their control in São Paulo. The gang does not allow mugging, rape, extortion, or the use of the PCC to resolve personal conflicts. It maintains a strict hierarchy, led by Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho. All members inside and outside are required to pay taxes. Members can be soldiers, towers (gang leaders in particular prisons), or pilots (who specialize in communications). The PCC has strong ties with the Red Command, Rio's most powerful drug- trafficking organization which is rumored to supply them with cocaine. Sweden Policy implications  (flip) Political scientist Benjamin Lessing predicts that crackdowns and harsher carceral sentences will increase prison gangs' control of outside actors, and that beyond a point, these policies limit state power. Lessing states, \\"the harsher, longer, and more likely a prison sentence, the more incentives outside affiliates have to stay on good terms with imprisoned leaders, and hence the greater the prison gangs' coercive power over those who anticipate prison.\\"Lessing, Benjamin. \\"How to Build a Criminal Empire from Behind Bars: Prison Gangs and Projection of Power *.\\" (n.d.): n. pag.

It established heavy penalties for knowingly endangering life through noncompliance. The law expired in 1991. Authority The law created a two-year program that went into effect in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico on June 24, 1989, and expired on June 21, 1991.United States. Medical Waste Tracking Act, , Nov. 1, 1988, , . The H.R. 3515 legislation was passed by the 100th Congressional session and signed into law by the 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan on November 2, 1988. History Beginning on August 13, 1987, a \\"30-mile garbage slick\\" composed primarily of medical and household wastes prompted extensive closures of numerous New Jersey and New York beaches.Markowitz, Eve. \\"State Narrows Probe of Beach Pollution.\\" The Record [NJ] 27 Aug. 1987: A03. Print. Investigations ongoing throughout the year indicated that the waste likely originated from \\"New York City's marine transfer stations … and the Southwest Brooklyn Incinerator and Transfer Station in particular…\\" The then-assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection stated his belief that the cause of pollution was intentional rather than accidental; \\"sealed plastic garbage bags, he said, were cut at the top, so their contents could disperse through the ocean.\\" Such a deliberate action may have arisen given the high cost (~$1500/ton) associated with the legal disposal of the waste, thus incentivizing private waste contractors to dump illegally to avoid high fees. Ultimately the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (MWTA) arose from the aftermath of this situation. It was designed primarily to monitor the treatment of medical wastes through their creation, transportation and destruction, i.e. from \\"cradle-to-grave.\\" Congress approved the bill \\"to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations on the management of infections waste.\\" In short, Congress enacted the MWTA as a pilot study to better determine how the life cycle of medical wastes played out under federal regulations.  Purpose  Definitions = Section 11002 of the MWTA, \\"Listing of Medical Wastes,\\" provides a listing of definitions on what materials will be classified as \\"medical wastes\\" under the act. The list includes within its definitions: \\"cultures and stocks of infectious agents,\\" \\"pathological wastes\\" such as body tissues, blood wastes and blood byproducts, sharps, contaminated carcasses and beddings of animals, surgery or autopsy wastes that were once in contact with infectious agents, \\"laboratory wastes,\\" \\"dialysis wastes that were in contact with the blood of patients undergoing hemodialysis,\\" medical equipment having come in contact with infectious agents, and further contaminated biological materials. Defining what objects were to be classified as medical wastes was crucial to ensure that all municipalities under the MWTA would be monitoring similar materials. = Management and tracking = Section 11003, \\"Tracking of Medical Waste,\\" outlined how the program should manage the transportation of waste materials. Four requirements were primarily identified; first, to provide a means of monitoring \\"the transportation of waste from the generator to the disposal facility\\" unless said waste had previously been incinerated. Secondly, to be able to ensure the \\"generator of the waste\\" that the waste had been \\"received by the disposal facility.\\" Next to develop a uniform form for the tracking of materials across states and finally to develop a means to label and contain the wastes for the safety of the handlers. Following this, Section 11004 on \\"Inspections\\" provides provisions allowing for agents of the EPA to \\"enter… any establishment… where medical wastes are or have been generated\\" so as to conduct \\"monitoring\\", \\"testing\\", or to \\"obtain samples from any person.\\".United States. Cong. House and Senate. H.R.3515. 100th Cong., 2nd sess. Washington: GPO, 1987. Print. This process would allow for the Agency to legally enter generating facilities for the purpose of determining if infectious agents and materials were being handled as prescribed by the EPA Administrator. = Enforcement = A major point of importance within the MWTA involves its inclusion of enforcement laws within the legislation. This becomes notable as it allows for one of the first instances in which an agency of the federal government may prosecute those charged with violation of regulations dealing with medical wastes. Following enactment of the MWTA the EPA Administrator may be allowed to \\"commence civil action in the United States district court in the district in which the violation occurred\\" against those being charged with the violation. Penalties ranged based on the level of violation, whether it was done with intention, and if such acts endangered the lives of other individuals. Minor violations of compliance orders would have resulted in a fine of $25,000 per day of \\"continued noncompliance.\\" Criminal penalties against those knowingly and intentionally violating the regulations of the MWTA may face two years of imprisonment or a $50,000 fine while those guilty of knowingly endangering the life of another through noncompliance may face upwards of fifteen years imprisonment and a $1,000,000 fine.  Outcomes  Through the information gathered during the promulgation of regulations for the MWTA, over a period of ten years the EPA eventually \\"concluded that the disease-causing potential of medical waste is greatest at the point of generation and naturally tapers off after that point... Thus, risk to the general public of disease caused by exposure to medical waste is likely to be much lower than risk for the occupationally exposed individual.\\" After expiration of the MWTA, state environmental and health agencies have continued to regulate medical waste, rather than EPA. Other federal agencies have issued safety regulations governing the handling of medical waste, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration.

At the time of the merger, the bank had a network of 423 branches spread over 15 states and the Union Territory of Daman and Diu. Prior to 1948, the region of Saurashtra, which at present forms a part of Gujarat State, comprised many small, medium and large princely states. Bhavnagar, Rajkot, and Porbandar, which were among the larger states, and two smaller states, Palitana and Vadia, had established their own Darbar (meaning Palace) Banks, the oldest of which was Bhavnagar Darbar Bank, established in 1902. These banks mainly catered to the needs of the governments of their respective princely states, and acted as depositories for local savings. After the establishment of Saurashtra state in 1948, there was a parallel amalgamation of these banks.

It was originally published in 1979 under the title \\"'\\" (\\"An abominable maple leaf on the ice\\"). It was adapted into an animated short called The Sweater (Le Chandail) by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in 1980 and illustrated by Sheldon Cohen. The story is based on a real experience Carrier had as a child in Sainte-Justine, Quebec in 1946 as a fan of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its star player, Maurice Richard. Carrier and his friends all wear Canadiens' sweaters with Richard's number 9 on the back. When his mother orders a new sweater from the department store in the big city after the old one has worn out, he is mistakenly sent a sweater of Montreal's bitter rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, instead. Carrier faces the persecution of his peers and his coach prevents him from playing. The Hockey Sweater is Carrier's most famous work and is considered an iconic piece of Canadian literature. The story has sold over 300,000 copies and has been republished in numerous anthologies. It exemplifies the nation's passion for hockey, and while it is often considered an allegory of the relationship and tensions that exist between francophones and anglophones, the story is popular throughout the entire nation. A line from the story appears on Canadian five- dollar bills as part of the Canadian Journey banknote series printed between 2001 and 2013. Background In the aftermath of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, tensions between francophones within the province and anglophones escalated as a provincial movement, led by the governing Parti Québécois, to separate from Canada reached its peak in the late 1970s. Seeking to explain Quebec's independence movement, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Toronto affiliate asked Roch Carrier, whose debut novel La Guerre, Yes Sir had been popular among both French and English Canadians, to explain \\"what does Quebec want?\\" Carrier spent several weeks trying to answer the question, ultimately producing what he described as a \\"flat essay\\" that was \\"dull as an editorial in a newspaper\\". Three days before his deadline, Carrier informed the CBC that he would not be able to complete the project. He was told that the network had already booked studio time for him and had been promoting his appearance. As he remained unwilling to present his essay, Carrier was asked to write about anything he wanted to fill the time. Considering what to write, Carrier thought of his own childhood. He stated in an interview that he began thinking of \\"when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story.\\" Summary alt=A young boy stands on a snow-covered street. He is wearing a dark-coloured sweater with a stylized maple leaf logo on the chest. The Hockey Sweater is based on a real experience Carrier had in 1946 in his home town of Sainte-Justine, Quebec. The story centres on the obsession he and his friends had with the Montreal Canadiens' organization and their star player, Maurice \\"The Rocket\\" Richard. He writes of how they emulated Richard's style and mannerisms, and on the ice: \\"we were five Maurice Richards against five other Maurice Richards, throwing themselves on the puck. We were ten players all wearing the uniform of the Montreal Canadiens, all with the same burning enthusiasm. We all wore the famous number 9 on our backs.\\" His old sweater having worn out, Carrier's mother seeks to replace it. She writes a letter to Eaton's in French to order a new sweater from their English-only catalogue. When the package arrives, the young Carrier is horrified to discover the sweater of the rival Toronto Maple Leafs was sent by mistake. He argues with his mother, who refuses to return the sweater for fear of offending \\"Monsieur Eaton\\", an English-speaking fan of Toronto. A humiliated Carrier wears the sweater to the rink where his peers stare at him in his blue sweater. His coach removes him from his usual forward position, holding him back as a reserve on defence. By the third period, he still has not played when one of his team's defencemen is struck with a stick. Believing his chance had finally come, Carrier jumps onto the ice, only to be given an immediate penalty by the parish priest acting as referee. The priest claims Carrier's substitution is illegal as there are already five players on the ice. Carrier is so angry that he smashes his stick on the ice in frustration, for which the priest scolds him: \\"just because you're wearing a new Toronto Maple Leafs sweater unlike the others, it doesn't mean you're going to make the laws around here.\\" The priest sends Carrier to the church to pray for forgiveness, where Carrier instead asks God to send \\"a hundred million moths\\" to eat his Toronto Maple Leafs sweater. Publication Carrier wrote the story in French, and it first appeared in 1979 under the title \\"\\" (\\"An abominable maple leaf on the ice\\") in a collection of his works called Les Enfants du bonhomme dans la lune (Children of the Man in the Moon). It appeared in an English translation by Sheila Fischman the same year as part of an English collection of Carrier's work called The Hockey Sweater and other stories. It has since been republished in numerous anthologies of Canadian and hockey literature. Adaptations A year after publication, the National Film Board of Canada adapted the story into a ten-minute animated short film called The Sweater. It was animated by Sheldon Cohen and voiced by Carrier. The film became one of the National Film Board's most popular works and has won numerous awards. It was named the Best Animated Film at the 1981 British Academy Film Awards. In 1982 Cohen approached May Cutler, founder of Tundra Books, to create an illustrated children's book of the story. It was published in 1984 as The Hockey Sweater, and by 2014 had sold over 300,000 copies. Following the success of the book, Cutler asked Carrier to write three more stories of his childhood to be illustrated by Cohen, each covering a different sport in a different season. They were published as The Boxing Champion (1991), The Longest Home Run (1994) and The Basketball Player (1996). During the fall season of 2017, The Segal Centre for Performing Arts, in Montreal, staged a musical adaptation of the story. Themes alt=A red sweater with a blue band and white trim across the middle. There is a stylized \\"CH\\" logo across the middle, the letter \\"C\\" at the left breast and the number 9 on the arms. The passion Carrier and his friends had for the game of hockey, particularly for the Montreal Canadiens, is the dominant theme of the story. In introducing the film for his video anthology Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites from the National Film Board of Canada, American critic Leonard Maltin noted that hockey is \\"an obsession, a country-wide preoccupation that dominates many lives\\", particularly those of children. He argued that The Sweater is one of the National Film Board's best animated works that combined humour with cultural significance. Of particular emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice Richard. Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, Richard was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season – one year before the events of The Hockey Sweater – Richard became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. Richard attended the 1980 premiere of The Sweater in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. Richard also requested copies so that he could show it to his own children. Sheldon Posen, curator of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, noted during the opening of an exhibit dedicated to Richard in 2004 that he had long been an idol in Quebec, but it was Carrier's story that expanded Richard's reputation in English Canada and sealed his place as a pan- Canadian hero. Jason Blake, a professor of English at the University of Ljubljana, argued the irony of this in his book Canadian Hockey Literature. He stated that many francophones viewed Richard as a \\"hero of the people, an athletic freedom fighter against the rest of Canada\\". The conflicts Carrier experienced in The Hockey Sweater are sometimes viewed as being an allegory for the relationship and tensions between French and English Canada, as well as the rivalry between the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs. Carrier stated, however, he had no political motivations, and only wished to \\"tell a good little story\\". Cultural impact The Hockey Sweater has achieved an iconic place in Canadian literature. It is the defining work of Carrier's career, and while he has lamented the fact that it has so overshadowed his other works, Carrier appreciates what its popularity has given him: \\"There is almost not one day in my life that there is not something nice that happens because of the story.\\" As an illustration of the place hockey holds in the Canadian psyche, the Bank of Canada placed a line from the story on the reverse of the 2001 series five-dollar bill, making Carrier the first author to be quoted on a Canadian banknote. The line, appearing in both French and English is: « Les hivers de mon enfance étaient des saisons longues, longues. Nous vivions en trois lieux : l’école, l’église et la patinoire; mais la vraie vie était sur la patinoire. » / \\"The winters of my childhood were long, long seasons. We lived in three places – the school, the church and the skating rink – but our real life was on the skating rink.\\" It is accompanied by scenes of children playing outdoors in the winter, centred by one in a Montreal Canadiens sweater with Maurice Richard's number 9 on his back. The illustrated book of The Hockey Sweater was among the children's books included as official Canadian gifts presented to the Prince of Wales and his family during an official visit in 1991, for his then nine-year-old son William. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, as part of a personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier. Of the story, Thirsk said: \\"It represents part of Canadian literacy, it represents support of reading and I just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Carrier.\\" The story has also been set to music by composer Abigail Richardson-Schulte as part of a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony, the Calgary Philharmonic and National Arts Centre Orchestras in 2012.

Life At Constantine's request, his father assigned him to rule the city of Murom, which at the time was inhabited by pagans, that he might spread Christianity in that region. According to the traditional account of his life, Constantine first sent his son Michael to Murom as his emissary, but the inhabitants threw him from the walls, so Constantine was obliged to take the city by force.Walsh, Michael J., \\"Constantine of Murom\\", A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West, Liturgical Press, 2007 However, he made no headway in converting them to Christianity and at one point they became so angry that a mob made their way to his fortress intending to storm the place. According to legend, when he appeared before them bearing what is now known as the Murom-Ryazan icon of the Theotokos, they quieted down and bowed reverently before the holy image.Murom-Ryazan icon of the Mother of God His son Fyodor, with his support, continued the missionary work in the surrounding countryside.

Cantal cheese was granted Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée certification in 1956. One of the oldest cheeses in France, Cantal dates back to the times of the Gauls. It came to prominence when Marshal Henri de La Ferté-Senneterre served it at the table of Louis XIV of France. Senneterre is also responsible for the introduction of Saint-Nectaire and Salers. Composition There are two types of Cantal cheese. Cantal Fermier is a farmhouse cheese made of raw milk. Cantal Laitier is the commercial, mass-produced version from pasteurized milk; both have to adhere to the same strict quality controls. Cantal is shaped like a cylinder. Cantal is made from raw or pasteurized cow's milk of the Salers breed. For Cantal, the milk of cows that are fed on hay (during 15 November to 15 April) is used; the summer milk of the same cows grazing on mountain meadows makes the Salers cheese. This semi-hard cheese is aged for several months. The form is massive, and the cheese has a soft interior. Its flavor, which is somewhat reminiscent of Cheddar, is a strong, tangy butter taste and grows with age. A well ripened Cantal has a vigorous taste, while a young cheese has the sweetness of raw milk. The pitted appearance of the crust of Cantal vieux is a result of the activity of cheese mites. Its smell is of earth and pasture lands, and is reminiscent of the rich pasture land of the Auvergne region from which it originates. According to the time of aging, three varieties are distinguished: *Cantal jeune (aged 1–2 months) *Cantal entre-deux or Cantal doré (aged 2–6 months) *Cantal vieux (aged more than 6 months). These are all available as fermier and laitier. Most (>80% of production) Cantal is of the first two varieties. Cantal vieux is already a hard cheese, if kept properly, it can last up to a year and a half without spoiling. It is not produced in large quantities. Much loved in the Cantal region, Cantal vieux is quite rarely exported due to its strong taste and can usually be found only in specialist stores. Cantal cheese has a fat content of 45%. It is used in soups, salads, aligot potatoeshttp://stlouiseats.typepad.com/st_louis_eats_and_drinks_/2007/10/scape.html cheese fondue and gratins. Cantal Fermier, like all cheeses made from raw milk, may contain Listeria bacteria on the crust, which should therefore be discarded; it is also not suitable for children, the elderly, or immunocompromised persons.

In the following example, from a violin sonata by Handel, the second measure is to be played with bariolage. The repeated A is played on the open A string, alternating with Fs and Es fingered on the adjacent D string. The notes on the D string (E and F natural) would be fingered as normal (first finger and low second), but the fingerings given above the second measure would be [2040 1040 2040 1040], indicating the switch (bariolage) from open A string to the stopped fourth finger on the D string, also playing the note A. center Another well-known example of bariolage is in Bach's Preludio to the E major Partita No. 3 for solo violin, where three strings are involved in the maneuver (one open string and two fingered notes). In the nineteenth century, notable examples of its use are found in Brahms's works. Brahms used this device in the String Sextet in G Major (where it occurs at the very beginning in the viola) and in the Third Violin Sonata, Op. 108.David Milsom, Theory and Practice in Late Nineteenth-Century Violin Performance, 1850–1900 (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited; Burlington, VT: Aldershot Publishing Company, 2003), p. 93\\\\. . Twentieth-century extensions Although this has been an established violinistic technique since at least the early eighteenth century, in contemporary music it may be regarded as an extended technique when used simultaneously in different instruments, or in conjunction with complex rhythmic layering or microtonal tunings. Examples may be found in Mauricio Kagel's 1993 string quartet Notturno and the cadenza of Giacinto Scelsi's 1965 Anahit. In the twentieth century, composers have adapted the bariolage idea to other instruments, particularly the trombone, where a constant pitch may be repeated while rapidly changing between different slide positions—a technique some composers call enharmonic change or enharmonic tremolo. Notable trombone pieces using this device are Luciano Berio's Sequenza V for solo trombone, and Vinko Globokar's Eppure si muove for a conducting solo trombonist and eleven musicians.James Max Adams, \\"Timbral Diversity: An Annotated Bibliography of Selected Solo Works for the Tenor Trombone Containing Extended Techniques\\", D.A. diss. (Greeley: University of Northern Colorado, 2008): pp. 6, 61, 111.

Westerfolds is classified as a metropolitan park and conserves riparian habitat within the Melbourne urban environment. The park nestles into a hilly bend in the Yarra River and has a network of bitumen and gravel paths, shelters, playgrounds, picnic tables and electric barbecues. It is a popular spot for picnics, and family gatherings on the weekend and public holidays. Other recreational pursuits include walking, cycling, rollerblading, walking the family dog, canoeing, horse riding and bird watching. Near the centre of the park atop a large hill lies the Manor House which housed the Mia Mia Gallery and Cafe, Indigenous Australian cultural education programs and gallery exhibiting Indigenous Australian Art. Mia Mia closed in 2013 and is no longer situated at the Park. New business tenants are currently being sought with a view to further develop, refurbish and restore the manor. History Aerial perspective of Odyssey House along the Yarra Main Trail, right across Westerfolds Park. Shot December 2018.In 1846 the land was purchased from the Crown. In the early 1930s, the Turner family bought the property and built the Manor in 1936. After World War II many of the dairy farms and orchards in the surrounding area were subdivided for urban development. Because of flooding in the Yarra River, Westerfolds was not subdivided and was eventually added to the Yarra Valley Parklands in 1977. Parks Victoria (then known as Melbourne Parks and Waterways) took over the management and conservation of Westerfolds Park in 1978. Revegetation and conservation programs are underway with the re-establishment of native grasslands and wetlands. Over 400 plant species native to the area can now be found including eucalypts, acacias, river red gums, and native grasses and shrubs. Visit in late winter and early spring to experience the wattle trees blooming throughout the park. Parrots, cockatoos, kookaburras, water and small bush birds can be seen, along with bats, platypus, wombats, koalas, possums, echidnas and, eastern grey kangaroos. Recreation Topdown of the nature playground at Wombat Bend Park, just west of Westerfolds ParkMain facade of the Manor House Westerfolds Park forms part of the main Yarra River Trail for cyclists and walkers to explore the Yarra river valley to the Melbourne CBD. Cyclists can access Westerfolds Park via the 4 km Diamond Creek Trail from Eltham station. =Cycling= The Yarra River Trail runs through the park. There is over 5 km of sealed pathways in very good condition, much of it is of generous width with a centre dividing line, gutters and drains. Many cyclists take the paths at high speed, particularly the through-route paths as cyclists travel through the park on longer journeys. Most pedestrians are considerate of cyclists and walk on the left hand side of pathways. Off road, there are many obscure dirt or gravel pathways winding through the bush, most of it is very flat and mainly used by casual cyclists as alternative routes to the sealed pathways. Occasionally, small mountain bike events are held on the trail in the middle of the park that crosses Kestrel Creek several times over a series of narrow boardwalks. Pedestrians occasionally use these boardwalks and it can be dangerous taking them at high speed unless the area is taped off for an event. =Walking and Running= Revegetation in 2009, planted in 2004 The 5 km of sealed pathways provides excellent conditions for runners and walkers, there are 4 or 5 drinking fountains evenly distributed throughout the park, roughly every kilometre, and seats and benches at similar intervals. Schools from the surrounding area hold annual fun run events in the park, this usually involves using 2 tracks, a short loop and a longer loop. Some small change rooms are available in the toilet facilities but these are infrequently kept. Snakes are rarely encountered unless pedestrians wander onto dirt and gravel paths. Pedestrians should always remain on the left hand side of pathways to enable safe shared use by cyclists and pedestrians. It is also the location for Westerfolds parkrun.

Contains a lengthy selection (134 pages) from his various writings including his two autobiographies and his important ideological tract \\"Two Rus Nationalities.\\", which existed in Kiev from January 1846 to March 1847. Kostomarov was also a poet, ethnographer, pan-slavist and promoter of the so-called Narodniks movement in the Russian Empire. Historian His father was a landlord, Ivan Petrovich Kostomarov, and he belonged to Russian nobility. His distant family roots were in the Grand Duchy of Moscow from the reign of Boris Godunov. His mother Tatiana Petrovna Melnikova was an ethnic Ukrainian and one of his father's serfs; that is why Nikolay Kostomarov de jure was a \\"serf\\" of his father. Kostomarov was a specialist of East Slavic folklore. He put forward the idea that there are two types of Rus' people, those of the Kievan background, among the Dnieper Basin, which he called Southern Russians, and those of the Novgorodian background, which he called Northern Russians. Kostomarov observed Northern Russians as a political hegemon of the Russian state. As a historian, Kostomarov's writings reflected the romantic trends of his time. He was the first Russian historian who used of ethnography and folksong in history, and tried to discern the \\"spirit\\" of the people, including the so-called \\"national spirit\\", by this method (see about: , narodnost'). On the basis of their folksongs and history, he said that the peoples of what he called Northern or Great Rus on one hand and Southern or Little Rus on the other (Russians and Ukrainians, respectively) differed in character and formed two separate Russian nationalities. In his famous essay Two Russian Nationalities (), a landmark in the history of Narodniks thought, he wrote what some consider to be the ideas of Russians inclined towards autocracy, collectivism, and state-building, and Ukrainians inclined towards liberty, and individualism. The article of Kostomarov on the problem of the psychological diversity of Rus' people in the Russian Empire had an impact on the scientific research of the collective psychology in Eastern Europe. In his various historical writings, Kostomarov was always very positive about Kievan Rus' and Novgorod Republic, about what he considered to be the veche system of popular assemblies (see especially his monography On the role of Novgorod the Great in the Russian history, ), and the later Zaporozhian Cossack brotherhood, which he thought in part was an heir to the democratic system as well. By contrast, he was critical of the old autocracy in the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Kostomarov gained some popular notoriety in his day by doubting the story of Ivan Susanin, a legendary martyr hero viewed as a savior of Muscovy (see: Ivan Susanin. Historical review ). Kostomarov was interested in the history of the insurgent leaders in Russia. His detailed writing on the case of Stepan Razin, one of the most popular figures in the history of the Don Cossack Host, was particularly important for the political evolution of Narodniks. Kostomarov vs. Pogodin Kostomarov stayed in the scientific polemic with Mikhail Pogodin. Kostomarov refused the fact that the name Rus' comes into Slavic area from Scandinavia, while Pogodin claimed that the first Rus' people came from Roslagen in the area of present-day Sweden. Pogodin connected the etnonym Rus' with Scandinavia with respect to the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. On the contrary linked Kostomarov the etnonym Rus' with East Slavic oucumene. The polemic between Kostomarov and Pogodin about the origin of Rus' had an influence on the building of two different historiographical schools in Russia: the so-called ″normannists″ and ″anti-normannists″. Under the impression of this polemics between Pogodin and Kostomarov, which took place at the Moscow Imperial University, Prince Pyotr Vyazemsky said: ″If we didn't know before which way we were going, now we don't know from where we are going as well″. Religion Kostomarov was a very religious man and a devout adherent of the Russian Orthodox Church. He was critical of Catholic and Polish influences on the area of Ukraine and Belarus throughout the centuries, but, nevertheless, was considered as more open to Catholic culture than many of his Russian contemporaries, and later, the members of the Slavic Benevolent Societies. Cultural politics He was considered by many to be a leading intellectual of the Narodniks. Nikolay Kostomarov was important in the history of both Russian and Ukrainian culture. The question of whether he was more \\"Russian\\" or more \\"Ukrainian\\" first arose while he was still alive and is still a matter of some dispute. Kostomarov was active in cultural politics in the Russian Empire being a proponent of a Pan- Slavic and federalized political system. He was a major personality in the Ukrainian national movement, a friend of the poet Taras Shevchenko, a defender of the Ukrainian language in literature and in the schools, and a proponent of a populist form of Pan-Slavism, a popular movement in a certain part of the Russian intelligentsia of his time. In the 1840s he founded an illegal political organization called the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Kiev (for which he suffered arrest, imprisonment, and exile). After that he moved to Saratov. From 1847 to 1854 Kostomarov, whose interest in the history of Little Russia and its literature made him suspected of separatist views, wrote nothing, having been banished to Saratov, and forbidden to teach or publish. But after this time his literary activity began again, and, besides separate works, the leading Russian reviews, such as Old and New Russia, The Historical Messenger, and The Messenger of Europe, contained many contributions from his pen of the highest value. 1992 Postage Stamp of Kostomarov In 1862, he was forced to resign from his post as chair of department of history of the University of Saint Petersburg, because he had sympathized with the revolutionary movement of liberals, progressives, and socialists. After his arrests, he continued to promote the ideas of federalism and populism in Ukrainian and Russian historical thought. He had a profound influence on later Ukrainian historians such as Volodymyr Antonovych and Mykhailo Hrushevsky. Writer Kostomarov in His Coffin (by Ilya Repin) Kostomarov was also a romantic author and poet, a member of the Kharkov Romantic School. He published two poetry collections (Ukrainian Ballads (1839) and The Branch (1840)), both collections containing historical poems mostly about Kievan Rus' and Bohdan Khmelnytsky. He also published a detailed analysis of the Great Russian folksongs. Kostomarov's poetry is known for including vocabulary and other elements of traditional elements and folk songs, which he collected and observed in his historical researchs with respect to the etnography. Kostomarov also wrote historical dramas, however these had little influence on the development of the theater. He also wrote a prose in Russian (the novelette Kudeyar, 1875), and a Russian mixed with Ukrainian peace (Chernigovka, 1881), but these also are considered insignificant.Kostomarov, Mykola at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine Original works *Nikolay Kostomarov, Russian History in Biographies of its main figures (), in Russian, available online; *Nikolay Kostomarov, On the role of Novgorod the Great in the Russian history (), in Russian, available online; *Nikolay Kostomarov, Two Russian Nationalities (), in Russian, available online; *Nikolay Kostomarov, Some thoughts on the Problem of Federalism in Old Rus' (); *Nikolay Kostomarov, Great Russian folksongs.
